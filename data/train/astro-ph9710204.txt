    "the recent discoveries of the excess of faint blue galactic counts ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 , ellis et al .  1996 ) and a substantial population of star forming galaxies at redshift @xmath1 33.5 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) may be taken as evidence of hierarchical structure formation ( kauffmann & white 1993 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) . however , the predicted abundance of galaxies at higher redshifts depends on , at the very least , models of stellar population synthesis and the imf . besides these abundances ,",
    "a more direct and independent detection of hierarchical evolution is necessary to form a convincing argument for this scenario as well as to discriminate among different models of structure formation .",
    "scenarios of hierarchical matter clustering are defined in terms of rules which determine how dark halos evolve from scale to scale .",
    "measuring correlations of structures at different scales is a direct and sensitive way to test the hypothesis of hierarchical clustering .",
    "we propose to detect this hierarchical structure by studying correlations between coefficients of a wavelet decomposition of the density field @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest relevant measures to quantify such scale - scale correlations and to discriminate between different scenarios .",
    "scale - scale correlation measures have been shown to effectively reveal hierarchical characteristics of energy transfer in turbulence and multiparticle physics ( yamada & ohkitani , 1991 , greiner , lipa , & carruthers , 1995 . )",
    "the hierarchical clustering model of galaxy formation generally refers to the assumption that the irreducible correlation functions are described by the hierarchical relations @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the @xmath5-th order correlation function , and @xmath6 are constants ( white 1979 ) .",
    "obviously , if the hierarchical relations hold exactly , the two - point correlation function plus all @xmath6 completely characterize the statistical features of galaxy formation , including higher order correlations such as scale - scale correlations .",
    "however , the hierarchical relations are only approximately fulfilled .",
    "studies in turbulence in which fractal hierarchical relations only approximately hold showed that scale - scale correlations were still useful in describing statistical features ( yamada & ohkitani , 1991 . ) therefore , scale - scale correlations will be useful in revealing deviations from the linked pair ansatz , and to discriminate among models including those satisfying the hierarchical relations approximately .",
    "in order to assess the discriminative power of scale - scale correlations we discuss two exactly solvable models of hierarchical clustering . the first is a gaussian version of the block model ( cole & kaiser 1988 ) employing an additive merging rule , while the second is similar in spirit , but uses a multiplicative merging rule ( adapted from meneveau & sreenivasan 1987 ) .",
    "both models give _ identical _ first and second order statistics and are constructed in such a way as to reproduce the experimental power spectrum .",
    "however , their different merging rules imply a quite different structure of correlations beyond second order .    * the gaussian block model*. a block of mass @xmath7 distributed uniformly over a length @xmath8",
    "is successively divided by a factor two , giving @xmath9 blocks at mass scale @xmath10 at the @xmath11-th iteration , while the length scale is @xmath12 .",
    "each block is labeled by the pair @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the scale ( with some appropriate cut - off scale @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 gives the position of a block at scale @xmath11 .",
    "the mean mass density of all blocks is @xmath17 .",
    "the density contrast is defined by @xmath18",
    ".    a realization of the density contrast field is then generated as follows : for the largest block @xmath19 , the density contrast is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is drawn from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath22 .",
    "for the two blocks ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) at the next finer scale @xmath23 , the two density contrasts are respectively enhanced and diminished by an additive factor @xmath24 which is again drawn randomly from a gaussian , but with a different variance @xmath25 .",
    "iterating down to scale @xmath15 , we obtain the additive merging rule of the gaussian block model : @xmath26 where each @xmath27 is drawn independently from a gaussian with variance @xmath28 which may depend on the scale @xmath11 but not on the position @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that in this scenario @xmath27 , describing the difference between density contrasts on scales @xmath30 and @xmath11 at overlapping positions , does not depend on the density @xmath31 in the parent block and is in this sense `` history '' independent .",
    "the finest scale distribution @xmath32 yields a realization of the density distribution @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 when @xmath35 .",
    "this @xmath2 is then to be compared to the observed density distribution on spatial resolution @xmath36 . in order to reproduce",
    "the power spectrum @xmath37 one has to choose for the variances @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "since all @xmath32 are constructed from sums of independent gaussian random variables , the resulting density matter field @xmath2 is a gaussian random field which , by definition , produces no genuine correlations beyond second order .    * the branching block model*. to apply block models to dark halos",
    ", we should identify holes with blocks satisfying the condition of collapse .",
    "this procedure introduces a history dependence in the sense that now the density differences between adjacent scales do depend on the value of the parent block .",
    "since we are not concerned with numerical details at the moment , we simply simulate this history dependence as follows : for block @xmath19 , the density contrast is assigned just as in the gaussian block model .",
    "the mass @xmath42 of block @xmath19 is split into blocks @xmath43 and @xmath44 with unequal masses of @xmath45 and @xmath46 or , with equal probability , vice versa .",
    "obviously , mass is conserved at each evolution step .",
    "the density contrasts are thus enhanced or diminished by multiplicative random weights @xmath47 , e.g.  @xmath48 and @xmath49 . here",
    "only the sign of @xmath50 is a random variable , assigning the positive sign with probability @xmath51 to the left and right sub - blocks respectively ; the value of @xmath50 is a scale - dependent constant in the range @xmath52 .    the general recurrence relation between the density contrast on adjacent scales @xmath11 and @xmath30 is now @xmath53 describing a hierarchical branching process .",
    "the multiplicative structure of this merging rule renders the resulting density field @xmath2 non - gaussian and leads to significant genuine correlations beyond second order .",
    "the difference between density contrasts on scales @xmath11 and @xmath30 , given by @xmath54 , is now obviously history dependent .",
    "although the gaussian- and branching - block models have very different evolution rules ( [ gbm_merge_rule ] ) and ( [ split_merge_rule ] ) , their first and second order moments can be made equal if @xmath50 is chosen recursively by @xmath55 we thus arrive at two paradigmatic models with quite different merging scenarios with identical means and covariances .",
    "no measure based on first and second order statistics can discriminate between these scenarios . clearly , what is needed is a measure of the hierarchical evolution by scale - scale correlations involving moments of order higher than two .",
    "the essential information of cluster formation is captured in the properties of the differences @xmath27 at two adjacent evolution steps .",
    "this is exactly the information obtained by a discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) . more generally , the coefficients @xmath27 of _ any _ decomposition @xmath56 with respect to a complete and orthogonal wavelet basis @xmath57 ( daubechies 1992 ) provide similar information on density differences at adjacent scales ; for the purpose of analysis , the particular choice of wavelet is of secondary importance and all will lead to comparable results ( pando & fang 1996 ) .",
    "the counts - in - cell ( cic ) method has been applied to study the scale - dependence of clustering and has even been applied to hierarchical studies ( balian & schaeffer 1989 , bromley 1994 )",
    ". however , there are differences between the cic and dwt analysis .",
    "the basis of the dwt decomposition [ eq.(6 ) ] @xmath57 is orthogonal with respect to both @xmath11 ( scale ) and @xmath29 ( position ) , while the basis ( or window ) for the cic is orthogonal with respect to @xmath29 , but not to @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the haar wavelet scaling functions ( which are equivalent to the cic with cubic cells ) are not localized in fourier ( scale ) space .",
    "it is not possible to effectively measure scale - scale correlations by a scale - mixed decomposition . on the other hand ,",
    "hierarchical clustering is characterized by local relations between large and small structures , and therefore , the decomposition should also be localized in physical space .",
    "the dwt is constructed by an orthogonal , complete and localized ( in both physical and fourier space ) basis . for these reasons , studying scale - scale correlations via",
    "the dwt is an effective tool .",
    "the statistical properties of the wavelet coefficients @xmath27 of a random field @xmath58 are most conveniently obtained once the generating function @xmath59 = \\left \\langle \\exp \\left (      i \\sum_{j=0}^{j-1 } \\sum_{l=0}^{2^j-1 } \\eta_{j , l}\\;\\tilde\\epsilon_{j , l }         \\right ) \\right \\rangle\\ ] ] is known , where @xmath60 represents the auxiliary variables @xmath61 and @xmath62 denotes the ensemble average . for both block model versions discussed above one can directly translate the merging rules into recursion relations for their generating functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 at two adjacent scales .",
    "the explicit formulae may be found in more detailed expositions ( greiner , lipa , & carruthers 1995 ; greiner et al .  1996 )    thus , various correlation quantities can be calculated from @xmath65 $ ] by taking appropriate derivatives .",
    "for instance , the correlations between a wavelet coefficient of a block @xmath29 at scale @xmath11 and it s left sub - block @xmath66 at scale @xmath30 are found by @xmath67 specifically , we use symmetric and normalized correlation measures with even orders @xmath68 , henceforth called scale - scale correlations : @xmath69 as expected , for the gaussian block model we obtain @xmath70 for all @xmath71 , i.e.  there are no scale - scale correlations of order greater than two .",
    "higher order correlations for the branching block model have been calculated in greiner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; the @xmath72 scale - scale correlations for a simplified version with scale - independent @xmath73 are @xmath74 thus , the @xmath75 provide a sensitive quantification of correlations between structures living at adjacent scales and discriminate clearly between a gaussian and branching scenario .",
    "it is interesting to point out that if the hierarchical relations ( white 1979 ) hold , the constant @xmath6 can approximately be described by the scale - scale correlations .",
    "for instance , for n=4 , we have @xmath76 this relation shows that it is possible to test the assumption that the @xmath6 are scale ( or @xmath11)-independent by scale - scale correlations ( pando , j. et al . 1997 . )",
    "it is generally believed that the ly@xmath0 forests of qso absorption spectra are due to the absorption of pre - collapsed clouds in the density field of the universe ( fang et al .",
    "hierarchical clustering requires that both collapsed halos and pre - collapsed clouds undergo similar merging evolutions . as such , the ly@xmath0 forests should be good candidates for detecting hierarchical clustering .",
    "we looked at two data sets of ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "the first was compiled by lu , wolfe and turnshek ( 1991 , hereafter lwt ) .",
    "the total sample contains @xmath77 950 lines from the spectra of 38 qso that exhibit neither broad absorption lines nor metal line systems .",
    "the second set is from bechtold ( 1994 , hereafter jb ) , which contains a total of @xmath77 2800 lines from 78 qso spectra , in which 34 high redshift qso s were observed at moderate resolution . to eliminate the proximity effect , all lines with @xmath78",
    "were deleted from our samples ( pando & fang 1996 ) .",
    "these samples cover a redshift range of 1.7 to 4.1 , and a comoving distance range from about @xmath79= 2,300 @xmath80mpc to @xmath813,300 @xmath82mpc , if @xmath83 and h@xmath84 km s@xmath85 mpc@xmath85 .",
    "we make block trees from the largest block @xmath86 with @xmath12 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the smallest block - size @xmath88 h@xmath85 mpc is about the scale where the effect of line blending occurs .",
    "moreover , since we will only study scale - scale correlations on scales equal to or larger than about @xmath89 h@xmath85 mpc , the influence of peculiar motions should be negligible .    to reduce the influence of the @xmath90-dependence in the mean density @xmath91 of ly@xmath0 lines , we chop the entire red - shift space into segments with size @xmath92 .",
    "this corresponds to a comoving space of 270 h@xmath85mpc for the lowest @xmath90 of the lwt and jb samples , and 110 h@xmath85mpc for the highest @xmath90 of the samples .    to account for the remaining @xmath90-dependence of @xmath91 ,",
    "100 random samples for each data set are generated by shifting each observed line by a random distance @xmath93 not exceeding the interval distance corresponding to @xmath94 .",
    "any line shifted outside the interval is wrapped around to bring it back into the interval .",
    "this procedure gives a de - correlated ( random ) sample which still reflects the @xmath90-dependence of the observed sample .",
    "both , the observed and random samples are suitable for statistical analysis on scales less than 100 h@xmath85 mpc .",
    "the real data and random sample are subjected to the four - coefficient daubechies discrete wavelet ( d4 ) , which is better localized in fourier space than the haar wavelet .",
    "1 shows the results for @xmath95 of the lwt and jb samples with line widths @xmath96  . clearly , the scale - scale correlation @xmath95 for the observational data is significantly larger than unity and well above the random samples on all scales @xmath97 ( i.e. less than about 80 h@xmath85 mpc ) .",
    "more importantly , the two independent data sets , lwt and jb , show similar behavior .",
    "thus , the detected scale - scale correlations seem to be an intrinsic feature of the clustered density field traced by ly@xmath0 forests .",
    "the influence of the @xmath90-dependence of @xmath91 is estimated by the values of @xmath95 for the random samples ( shaded regions in fig .",
    "1 ) ; these are slightly above unity , but can certainly not explain the strong @xmath11-dependence of the lwt and jb samples .    the ly@xmath0 absorption line distribution is a discrete process .",
    "the discreteness is a source of non - gaussianity as it is very well known that poisson noise is non - gaussian .",
    "the question naturally arises as to whether the non - gaussianity measured by @xmath98 is caused by a poisson process .",
    "this non - gaussianity has been carefully studied in greiner , lipa and carruthers ( 1995 ) and fang and pando ( 1997 ) .",
    "the main conclusion is that the non - gaussianity of poisson noise is significant only on scales of the mean distance of nearest neighbors .",
    "the distributions on large scales are a superposition of the small scale field . according to the central limit theorem",
    "the non - gaussianity of poisson noise will rapidly and monotonously approach zero on larger scales . in our analysis",
    "the scales being studied are larger than 5 h@xmath85 mpc which is much larger than the mean distance between nearest neighbor ly - alpha lines .",
    "@xmath99 is not due to the discreteness of samples or noise , especially for larger scales .",
    "1 also demonstrates that the branching block model reproduces the trend of the observed data , while the gaussian block model ( @xmath100 ) certainly lacks a mechanism that produces the observed hierarchical correlation structure even when the @xmath90-dependence of the mean number density of ly@xmath0 clouds is taken into account .",
    "scale - scale correlations @xmath75 and possible variants are viable statistical measures to discriminate between different scenarios of merging dynamics of large scale structures of the universe . they provide a direct clue of how larger halos and clouds are built up from their substructures at smaller scales .",
    "the wavelet transform is a fast and convenient tool to obtain the necessary information on localized contributions to the matter density field at different scales .    just as the two - point correlation function @xmath101 is an indicator of spatial clustering , scale - scale correlations @xmath102",
    "indicate some sort of `` history '' dependence in hierarchical clustering schemes .",
    "the scale - scale correlations of the one - dimensional ly@xmath0 forests show , indeed , features expected by multiplicative hierarchical clustering .",
    "similar features have been found in the case of hydrodynamical turbulence .",
    "one can conclude that the halos hosting ly@xmath0 clouds must have undergone a `` history '' dependent evolution process in some way during their formation .",
