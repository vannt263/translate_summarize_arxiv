    "newton s mechanics describes particle motions relative to external absolute space and time .",
    "the evolution of an isolated system of @xmath4 particles is determined by a set of independent initial positions and velocities , whose sole ambiguity lies in the choice of the inertial frame we use to express the initial configuration .",
    "thus the system has @xmath5 degrees of freedom . the quality of _ inertial _ is conferred by the state of motion of the frame relative to the absolute space .",
    "this approach was criticized by leibniz and mach , who claimed for a dynamics of relations among particles without any reference to external non - material entities @xcite .",
    "mach s ideas guided einstein in its way towards general relativity : _",
    "`` ... it is contrary to the mode of thinking in science to conceive of a thing ( the space - time continuum ) which acts itself , but which can not be acted upon .",
    "this is the reason why e. mach was led to make the attempt to eliminate space as an active cause in the system of mechanics '' _ @xcite . during the last century",
    ", different strategies have been tried to formulate a relational mechanics in agreement with mach s thought .",
    "most of them were based on a reformulation of the kinetic energy as a sum of `` interaction '' terms decreasing with the distance @xcite .",
    "however these approaches predicted non - observed anisotropies of the inertia @xcite , and could not explain the undisputable success of newton s theory .",
    "the idea that the lagrangian should exhibit gauge invariance under the galilean group was introduced in references and .",
    "this requirement guarantees the abolition of the absolute space , since any frame becomes valid to apply the dynamical equations ; but it does not completely prescribe the lagrangian . in ref .",
    "a given lagrangian is _ gauged _ by replacing its measure ( kinetic energy ) with a measure defined in the space of _ orbits _",
    "( each orbit represents a set of configurations that are equivalent under gauge transformations ) . the measure between two orbits , or",
    "_ intrinsic differential _ , results from minimizing the original measure between configurations belonging to the involved orbits ( `` best matching '' @xcite ) .",
    "the so obtained gauge invariant dynamics is left with those solutions to the original lagrangian having vanishing momentum and angular momentum .",
    "this strategy has been improved in ref .  , where it is extended to arbitrary symmetry groups and finite transformations , on the basis of comparing with yang - mills gauge theories .",
    "in this article we will follow the approach of gauging a well established lagrangian : the one for standard newton s mechanics . instead of defining a measure between orbits",
    ", we will introduce counterterms in the kinetic energy to compensate the changes of newton s kinetic energy under gauge transformations . in this way",
    ", we will get an explicitly gauge invariant lagrangian leading to equations of motion that are valid in any frame .",
    "newton s laws are invariant under _ rigid _",
    "( time - independent ) time translations , and space translations and rotations of particle s positions @xmath6:@xmath7where @xmath8 is an orthogonal matrix . if the rotation is infinitesimal , it becomes@xmath9where @xmath10 is a vector directed along the axis of rotation , whose infinitesimal modulus is the angle of rotation .",
    "besides , newton s laws are invariant under galileo transformations,@xmath11which constitute a particular case of _ local _ ( time - dependent ) space translations : those having @xmath12",
    ".    transformations ( [ time]-[rotation ] ) and ( [ boost ] ) constitute the _ galilean group _ of newton s mechanics . in newton s mechanics , absolute space and time are represented by the privileged family of inertial frames and clocks , which relate each other through the transformations of the galilean group .",
    "the abolition of absolute space then calls for the elimination of privileged frames : the _ dynamics of relations _ must be governed by laws to be applied in any frame .",
    "this goal can be attained by building the mechanics as a gauge theory of the galilean group . to turn the galilean group into a gauge group means to succeed in becoming local those already existing rigid symmetries .",
    "if so , not only rigid rotations will be allowed but any time - dependent rotation too ; not only galileo transformations will leave invariant the equations of motion but any time - dependent space translation too . the absolute time",
    "would be eliminated as well , since gauging the time translation implies that the parameter @xmath13 can be changed in an arbitrary way : @xmath14 ; thus , the time parameter would become physically irrelevant . in sum ,",
    "the dynamics of relations calls for lagrangians that are invariant under arbitrary _ time - dependent _ rotations and translations together with arbitrary redefinitions of the time parameter . in such case",
    ", no privileged frames and clocks will remain in the formulation of mechanics , what is the mark of relational mechanics .",
    "since galileo transformations will be subsumed in the subgroup of local translations , it results that the gauge group of relational mechanics is composed of transformations ( [ time]-rotation ) .",
    "this gauge group has been called _ leibniz group _ in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) .",
    "a typical feature of gauge theories is the existence of constraints among the canonical variables .",
    "this means that not all the variables represent genuine degrees of freedom . in particular , by gauging translations and rotations the system of @xmath4 particles is left with @xmath15 degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics of relations has less degrees of freedom than newton s dynamics because evolutions consisting in rigid translations and rotations means nothing in relational mechanics .",
    "the redundant variables can be frozen by fixing the gauge . in relational mechanics",
    "this procedure is equivalent to choose a frame .",
    "as we will show , relational mechanics contains frames where newton s equations are valid .",
    "but such frames are determined by the matter distribution of the universe , as required by mach .    in section",
    "[ gauging ] we obtain a lagrangian that is invariant under local translations and rotations .",
    "we study the constraints and gauge fixing conditions associated with this lagrangian . in section [ equations ]",
    "we obtain the relational equations of motion , and show the existence of frames where newton s equations are valid .",
    "we apply these equations to the case of newton s bucket to show that the centrifugal effect would disappear if the rest of the universe were absent .",
    "we compare this result with the nature of the centrifugal effect in general relativity .",
    "we also discuss the status of the weak equivalence principle . in section [ elimination ]",
    "we explain how the absolute time is eliminated by parametrizing the system . in section [ scaleinvariance ] we show that the scale invariance can also be gauged by including a counterterm associated with the intrinsic virial function ( the scale invariance requires potentials that are inversely proportional to the squared distances ) . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we display the conclusions .",
    "as a first step in the way to its relational formulation , mechanics should be reduced to a dynamics of relative positions@xmath16this goal can be reached by _ gauging _ the translations ; this means the process of becoming _ local _",
    "( dependent on time ) the rigid symmetry ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "in fact , velocities are not invariant under local translations but change as@xmath17therefore , a lagrangian invariant under local translations is expected to depend just on relative velocities @xmath18 .",
    "the process of gauging a rigid symmetry in gauge theories involves the introduction of gauge fields to compensate the ( bad ) behavior of derivatives under local transformations . in a more technical language ,",
    "one introduces a _ connection _ to make the derivatives behave in a _ covariant _ way ; i.e. , thanks to the compensating terms the derivatives behave in the same way both under local and rigid transformations . in gauge theory , the dynamics is constrained by relations emerging from the local symmetry the fields obey . the constrains",
    "imply that not all the fields are genuine degrees of freedom , since their initial values can not be chosen in a completely free way .",
    "a remarkable feature of gauge fields is that they mediate interactions by carrying energy - momentum at a finite propagation velocity .",
    "instead , classical mechanics describes interactions through potentials @xmath19 depending just on the distances between particles ; it is the realm of _ instantaneous interactions at a distance_. as a consequence , the degrees of freedom associated with the external space and time can be eliminated _ without _ introducing new fields , but just resorting to the same dynamical variables we started from .",
    "this can be made by providing the lagrangian with compensating terms depending on positions and velocities .",

    "we have obtained the lagrangian ( [ newlagrangian ] ) which does not involve the idea of an absolute space :  it can be used in any frame .",
    "however it still depends on the absolute time . to remove the absolute time we should gauge the time translation @xmath151 .",
    "since @xmath13 is a parameter identifying each configuration of the system in a temporal succession , a time translation is a relabeling ( _ reparametrization _ ) of the consecutive configurations .",
    "the invariance of the lagrangian under rigid time translations is related to the conservation of the energy .",
    "therefore , we expect that the requirement of gauge ( local ) invariance under reparametrizations will lead to a hamiltonian first class constraint @xmath152i.e . some relation among the momenta that causes the vanishing of the hamiltonian @xmath79 .",
    "gauging the time translations does not involve counterterms for compensating the bad behavior of derivatives in the kinetic energy , since such behaviors do not come from the objects under differentiation but from the operator @xmath153 itself .",
    "in fact , under local time translations @xmath154 the derivative changes as@xmath155therefore velocities change as @xmath156^{-1}\\,\\dot{q}=n(t)^{-1}\\,\\dot{q}$ ] .",
    "since the invariance of the action is the invariance of @xmath157 , then the behavior of the lagrangian under reparametrizations should be@xmath158this behavior characterizes the so called _ parametrized systems _",
    "the invariance of the action means that the action is unable to distinguish the trajectories @xmath159 from the reparametrized ones @xmath160 ; therefore , the parameter @xmath13 is physically irrelevant",
    ". let us differentiate the equation ( [ parameter ] ) with respect to @xmath161 : @xmath162 since this result is valid whatever the function @xmath163 is , one can substitute it with @xmath164 to conclude that parametrized systems come with a constraint @xmath165 that cancels out the hamiltonian , as expected .",
    "on the constraint surface , the hamiltonian constraint @xmath165 commutes with @xmath166 , @xmath167 because @xmath168 , @xmath169 are conserved quantities .",
    "thus , the entire set of constraints remains first class . in a parametrized system",
    ", the evolution along the irrelevant time @xmath13 can be regarded as a gauge transformation , since the evolution is carried on by the first class hamiltonian ( see eq .",
    "( [ hprime ] ) ) for the free  functions in eqs .",
    "( [ derivative ] ) and ( constrainth ) for reasons that will become clear in eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) . ] @xmath170 as explained in section [ gaugefixing ] , the freedom associated with @xmath165 can be fixed by adding an admissible gauge condition @xmath171 .",
    "so we choose @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is invariant under translations and rotations , and satisfies @xmath174 .",
    "thus it results @xmath175 , which means that @xmath173 is a dynamical quantity that monotonically increases along the evolution ; it is a _ physical clock _",
    "defined by the system itself , also called _ internal _ time @xcite .",
    "the gauge condition @xmath176 means that the irrelevant parameter @xmath13 can be replaced by the internal time @xmath177 .",
    "a well known example of parametrized system is the relativistic free particle , @xmath178which displays a constraint between the conjugate momenta:@xmath179the constraint surface splits into two sheets ; we will keep the negative sign for @xmath73 ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "then , the hamiltonian constraint is@xmath181this constraint causes the vanishing of the hamiltonian @xmath79 : @xmath182we can fix the gauge by choosing the physical ( internal ) time @xmath183 , that satisfies @xmath184 .",
    "however this is not the sole choice for the physical time .",
    "for instance , @xmath185 yields @xmath174 ; so , it is a good internal time .",
    "any function @xmath186 such that @xmath187 is a good choice too .",
    "the gauge @xmath188 fixes the irrelevant time parameter to be equal to @xmath75 .",
    "so @xmath189 and the lagrangian becomes @xmath190 .",
    "but , as said , there are many other forms for replacing the parameter @xmath13 with an internal time .",
    "the free relativistic particle also shows how to _ parametrize _ a system : we achieve the property ( [ parameter ] ) by replacing the velocities @xmath106 with @xmath191 and multiplying the lagrangian by a factor @xmath74 .",
    "finally , we take @xmath75 to be a new canonical variable . for instance",
    "@xmath192so , a possible strategy for eliminating the absolute time consists in adding the system with a new canonical variable @xmath75 causing the parameter @xmath13 becomes physically irrelevant .",
    "the new variable does not imply a new degree of freedom , since it comes together with a new constraint ( the hamiltonian constraint ) ; so the original number of degrees of freedom of the non - parametrized system is kept .",
    "once the variable @xmath75 was introduced through this procedure , it can be mixed with the rest of canonical variables by means of canonical transformations .",
    "it could be said that the procedure hides the absolute time among the canonical variables .",
    "however , once the time was hidden , there are many internal times all of them on an equal footing that can be retrieved by fixing the gauge .",
    "thus , the privileged absolute time was lost forever .",
    "let us parametrize a classical particle : @xmath193the canonical momenta are@xmath194then the hamiltonian constraint is@xmath195and the hamiltonian @xmath196 vanishes .",
    "the hamiltonian evolution is governed by @xmath197 .",
    "then it is@xmath198whose solution is expressed in terms of an arbitrary time parameter @xmath199 that can be freely fixed .",
    "besides it is@xmath200equation ( [ classicalp ] ) shows that the conserved quantity @xmath73 is ( minus ) the energy of the classical particle . equation ( [ dotq ] )",
    "shows that @xmath75 is a pure gauge variable : its dynamics remains ambiguous since @xmath163 is arbitrary .",
    "like in the previous example , one could fix the gauge by choosing @xmath201 , or any other admissible gauge condition .    the procedure described in this subsection",
    "can be used to parametrize the lagrangian ( [ newlagrangian ] ) . in such case",
    ", the so built parametrized lagrangian will have @xmath202 canonical variables , since @xmath75 is added to the @xmath4 vectors @xmath203 , together with @xmath204 first class constraints .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom will then result @xmath15 . in this sense ,",
    "any system displaying an absolute time , like the one described by lagrangian([newlagrangian ] ) , could be regarded as a gauge - fixed parametrized system .      a different approach to the problem of eliminating the absolute time consists in regarding the clock as a piece of the original mechanical system . in such case",
    ", we will not add a canonical variable @xmath75 to the system of @xmath4 particles .",
    "instead , we will try to relate the evolution of the rest of the system to that piece of the system playing the role of clock .",
    "if convenient , a parameter @xmath13 will be still introduced ; but the action can not be sensitive to it . the action should contain only positions and velocities of the particles and , at the same time , behave as a parametrized system .",
    "these features are fulfilled by the jacobi - like action @xcite whose lagrangian is @xcite @xmath205where @xmath206 is a constant and @xmath207 is the _ compensated _ kinetic energy of lagrangian ( [ newlagrangian ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath207 is made up of terms quadratic in the velocities ; then , @xmath208 is invariant under reparametrizations . in this case",
    "the canonical momenta are@xmath209where @xmath210 are the momenta obtained in eq .",
    "( [ newmomentum ] ) ; they satisfy ( see eq .",
    "( [ newlagrangian2 ] ) ) @xmath211therefore we obtain the hamiltonian constraint @xmath212thus @xmath206 looks as the total energy of the universe .",
    "however , differing from jacobi s idea , its value can not be chosen within the initial conditions because @xmath206 enters the action as a universal constant .",
    "furthermore , the initial conditions are constrained to fulfill the eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) for a given value of @xmath213 .",
    "instead , the constraint ( [ classicalh ] ) allowed the total energy to take any value because the initial value of @xmath73 was not constrained .",
    "this is the only difference between both approaches .",
    "so this approach displays one degree of freedom less than the former : since the number of variables has not been increased , the number of degrees of freedom reduces to @xmath214 .",
    "otherwise the dynamics is still governed by the equations ( [ he ] ) , because the form of @xmath165 as a function of @xmath105 , @xmath55 is the same in both cases .",
    "it can be verified that lagrange equations recover their usual form too , since the constraint implies that the factor @xmath215 is equal to @xmath104 . concerning the choice of an internal time @xmath216 ,",

    "dilatational momentum_. scale transformation should not be confused with a change of units . a change of units not only scales positions and velocities but also changes the fundamental constants entering the lagrangian , in such a way that the lagrangian is affected only by a global harmless factor . instead , a ( rigid ) scaling only affects positions and velocities",
    "; so one can not expect an inoffensive effect .",
    "in general , lagrangians are not invariant under rigid scalings .",
    "however , let us consider the parametrized lagrangian ( [ jacobi ] ) in the case @xmath221 .",
    "this lagrangian would be invariant under rigid scalings if the interaction potentials were inversely proportional to the squared distances .",
    "in fact , under rigid scalings the compensated kinetic energy transforms as@xmath222(@xmath223 ; @xmath224 is homogeneous of degree @xmath225 in the velocities but homogeneous of degree @xmath226 in the positions ) .",
    "so the behavior of @xmath207 under rigid scalings is compensated by the potential only if @xmath227 .",
    "we will now consider the gauging of the scale invariance .",

    "] since @xmath220 is going to be the generator of a gauge transformation , we expect the constraint @xmath231concerning @xmath166 and @xmath169 , @xmath220 is  a first class constraint ; in fact , @xmath220 is invariant under rotations and @xmath232 . besides @xmath233 vanishes on the constraint surface in the considered case .",
    "in fact @xmath234where@xmath235since @xmath236 one obtains @xmath237thus one gets the vanishing of @xmath233 on the constraint surface : instead the newtonian potential @xmath238 leads to @xmath239 . in such case , @xmath220 monotonically increases on - shell ( @xmath240 ) since the newtonian potential is negative .",
    "because of this reason , @xmath241 is a good internal time for a classical self - gravitating system .",
    "this property has been exploited in ref .   to handle the _ problem of time _ in quantum gravity @xcite within the framework of a dimensionless formulation .",
    "] @xmath242    let us study the compensating term we should add to the lagrangian ( newlagrangian ) for gauging the scale invariance . since velocities change as@xmath243the infinitesimal change of the intrinsic kinetic energy is@xmath244this behavior can be compensated by the term @xmath245 , where @xmath3 is the _ intrinsic virial _ ( the virial in a center - of - mass frame):@xmath246and @xmath247 is the intrinsic _ _  scalar _ _ moment of inertia:@xmath248both @xmath3 and @xmath247",
    "are invariant under local rotations and translations ; so , they do not interfere the local invariance of the kinetic energy . in @xmath249",
    "only the behaviors of the velocities are relevant under scaling , because the scaling factors coming from the @xmath250 s compensate each other .",
    "therefore@xmath251besides the term @xmath252 in ( [ newlagrangian ] ) changes because the velocities change ( the scaling factors coming from @xmath250 s compensate each other ) .",
    "so , we just consider the change@xmath253which coincides with a rigid change ;  so it does not need a compensating term .",
    "thus the kinetic energy@xmath254behaves under local scalings just as under rigid scalings . the conjugated momenta @xmath255 ~   \\label{newnewmomentum}\\]]satisfy , as expected , the constraint ( [ gconstraint ] ) .",
    "moreover , the new compensating term @xmath256 does not modify the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) .",
    "the momenta ( [ newnewmomentum ] ) contain the particle velocities relative to a frame based at the center of mass that rotates with the mean angular velocity of the system , diminished by a sort of mean radial velocity of the system .",
    "therefore , the global expansion has been deducted from the particle velocities . as a consequence ,",
    "the momenta have the same behavior under rigid and local scalings , namely @xmath257 .",
    "kinetic energy ( [ tscaling ] ) can be rewritten as ) , the terms entering the bracket to compensate rotations and expansions have the general structure @xmath258 , such that @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "besides , both compensating terms are mutually orthogonal .",
    "these are the essential ingredients to obtain just contributions @xmath261 when performing the square of @xmath262 .",
    "the somewhat different structure of the compensating term @xmath30 is due to the fact that we started from an action that is already invariant under galileo transformations , which is a particular case of local translations.]@xmath263the system has @xmath5 canonical coordinates and @xmath264 first class constraints  @xmath265,@xmath266 , @xmath220 , @xmath165 .",
    "so , @xmath267 genuine degrees of freedom are left in shape - dynamics .",
    "for instance , @xmath268 particles would have @xmath225 degrees of freedom in shape - dynamics , that relate to the two angles one needs to define a triangle regardless of its size and orientation ; but one of these degrees of freedom is related to the internal time .",
    "newton s mechanics relies on external symmetries linked to the concepts of absolute space and time .",
    "these symmetries manifest themselves through the idea of inertial frames together with the galilean group as a tool for relating coordinates belonging to different inertial frames .",
    "instead , relational mechanics describes the system by means of equations that can be used in any frame .",
    "this means that relational mechanics is not involved with absolute magnitudes but only with the relative motions of the particles of the system .",
    "this goal is reached by gauging the galilean group ; i.e. , by adding compensating terms that makes the kinetic energy behave in the same way under rigid and local translations and rotations . the compensating terms do not contain external fields but are built with the own variables of the system , in such a way that the gauge invariant lagrangian results to be written just in terms of intrinsic quantities ( notice that intrinsic quantities ( [ kinetic ] ) , ( [ j ] ) and ( [ itensor ] ) look like the respective usual quantities in a center - of - mass frame ) .",
    "as in any gauge theory , the generators of gauge transformations 3 translations and 3 rotations in this case become first class constraints .",
    "so , the system loses 6 degrees of freedom since global time - dependent translations and rotations have been excluded from the category of _ motions _ : they do not constitute changes of the relations between particles . in the lagrange formulation of relational mechanics , two sets of initial conditions that differ in a gauge transformation ( a change to an arbitrarily moving frame ) are equivalent ; in particular , any configuration corresponding to a rigid motion is equivalent to the state of rest . in the hamiltonian formulation ,",
    "the losing of 6 degrees of freedom is evidenced in the fact that the set of initial data for the canonical variables is constrained by 6 constraint functions .",
    "differing from the absolute space , absolute time is not eliminated by means of counterterms that covariantize the time derivative .",
    "the gauging of time translations affects the operator @xmath153 itself .",
    "so , we have to resort to forms of lagrangian that reproduce the usual dynamics but leave the parameter @xmath13 as an irrelevant quantity that can be arbitrarily changed ; these are the parametrized lagrangians .",
    "in particular , the jacobi action describes a parametrized system which acquires scale invariance if the potentials are inversely proportional to the squared distances .",
    "this rigid invariance can be gauged by introducing a new counterterm in the kinetic energy .",
    "the result is the lagrangian for the so called shape - dynamics .",
    "relational equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) exhibit two types of interaction . on the one hand",
    ", the potential @xmath228 provides gauge invariant forces between pairs of particles . on the other hand ,",
    "each particle interacts with the entire universe through gauge dependent inertial forces",
    ". the unquestionable success of newton s laws can be fully understood in the framework of relational mechanics : newton s laws are valid in any frame where the center of mass of the universe moves at a constant velocity , and the total intrinsic angular momentum of the universe @xmath34 vanishes ( however , newtonian solutions must be filtered by the gauge condition @xmath116 ) .",
    "this result realizes mach s principle , in the sense that these privileged newtonian frames are selected by the distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "the origin of the inertial forces lies in the entire universe , as seen in the example of newton s bucket .",
    "in his famous article of 1916 , einstein began  2 by saying _ `` in classical mechanics , and no less in the special theory of relativity , there is an inherent epistemological defect which was , perhaps for the first time , clearly pointed out by ernst mach '' _ @xcite .",
    "he then paraphrased newton s thought experiment of the rotating bucket by proposing two equally constituted fluid bodies in relative rotation around the axis joining their centers , at a relative distance enough large to ignore the gravitational interaction .",
    "einstein said that if one of the bodies resulted to be spherical and the other one an ellipsoid of revolution , then it should exist a physical reason other than the rotation with respect to the absolute space for such a difference .",
    "relational mechanics can tackle the issue because no difference is expected if the bodies are the sole constituents of the universe .",
