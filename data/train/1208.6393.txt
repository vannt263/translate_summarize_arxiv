    "light scattering methods are a powerful tool for investigating the structure and the dynamics of soft and biological matter .",
    "the typical space and time scales that are probed range from tens of nanometers to tens of microns , and from a fraction of a microsecond to several hours , respectively .",
    "typical applications include particle sizing , the characterization of aggregation phenomena , the determination of interparticle interactions , the investigation of the structure and the relaxation dynamics of complex fluids .",
    "the diversity of systems that can be studied makes the technique appealing for both academic laboratories and industry : suspensions of colloidal particles or emulsions , solutions of polymers and proteins , foams , and surfactant phases are but a few examples of such systems .",
    "scattering methods may be divided in two classes : static and dynamic light scattering . in static light scattering ( sls )",
    "@xcite , one probes the structure of a sample by measuring the time - averaged scattered intensity as a function of the scattering angle . by contrast , dynamic light scattering ( dls)@xcite focuses on the temporal fluctuations of the scattered intensity in order to extract valuable information on the sample dynamics . in both cases ,",
    "the sample is typically illuminated by a laser beam , while photodiodes , avalanche photodiodes , photomultiplier tubes or ccd or cmos cameras are used as a detector .",
    "a wide variety of light scattering apparatuses have been developed , many of which are commercially available .",
    "the design of a setup is in general optimized according to the range of scattering angles to be covered and the kind of measurements to be performed ( static or dynamic ) .",
    "wide - angle light scattering ( wals ) setups often provide both sls and dls measurements , covering approximately the range @xmath1 , corresponding to length scales of order @xmath2 ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the scattering vector , with @xmath6 the solvent refractive index , @xmath7 the in - vacuo laser wavelength and @xmath8 the scattering angle .",
    "however , it should be noted that in practice it is difficult to obtain reliable data below @xmath9 , because the cylindrical sample geometry that it is usually adopted in wals limits the quality of the optical interfaces .",
    "small - angle and ultra - small - angle light scattering setups ( sals and usals , respectively ) are specialized for measurements close to the forward direction , with scattering angles covering up to two decades , up to approximately @xmath10 for sals and a few degrees for usals .",
    "the corresponding length scales vary between a few microns and tens or even hundreds of microns .",
    "while some of these setups use dedicated photodiode detectors optimized for sls but unfit for dls  @xcite , the adoption of a ccd or cmos detector is increasingly popular , since it allows for both static and dynamic light scattering to be performed  @xcite , as first shown by the pioneering work of wong and wiltzius  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there is little if any overlap between the range of scattering angles of typical wals and sals or usals setups : this leaves uncovered a crucial angular range corresponding to probed length scales on the order of a micron , the characteristic size of many colloidal objects of industrial and fundamental science interest .",
    "additionally , absolute intensity measurements are notoriously difficult in light scattering , especially for sals or usals , thus making it difficult to merge data from different setups on the same scale . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "a few apparatuses covering the `` mid angle '' range ( mid - angle light ccattering , mals ) have been proposed in the past .",
    "the apparatus described in ref .",
    "@xcite covers an impressive angular range ( @xmath11 ) , using a custom made cell and dedicated photodiode arrays and electronics .",
    "ferri and coworkers report a setup covering scattering angles up to @xmath12  @xcite , using a commercially available cell but again a custom photodiode array with dedicated electronics .",
    "a different approach is used in the commercially available apparatus of ref .",
    "@xcite , which covers scattering angles from a fraction of degree up to about @xmath13 by varying the propagation direction of the incident beam .",
    "accordingly , several distinct measurements are required to sample the full angular range , each measurement covering about @xmath14 .",
    "chou and hong  @xcite report a ccd - based setup in the range @xmath15 using a scheme originally proposed by ferri for sals  @xcite . unfortunately , however , no detailed description and characterization of the apparatus performances are provided .",
    "finally , one may take advantage of the good - quality optics of modern microscopes to build an apparatus that combines imaging with low- or mid - angle scattering .",

    "@xcite , a microscope- and ccd - based static light scattering instrument is presented , covering the range @xmath19 , corresponding approximately to @xmath20 .    with the exception of the setups of refs .",
    "@xcite that could in principle be extended to dls , these apparatuses are unfit for simultaneous static and dynamic light scattering at multiple angles , either because the angular range is sampled sequentially , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , or because photodiodes that cover a very large number of speckles are used , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , a design not appropriate for dls  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that photodiode arrays are typically larger than ccd or cmos detectors : this makes it difficult to transpose the optical layout of refs .",
    "@xcite to a ccd - based apparatus and would impose extra constraints on the cell dimensions , in particular its thickness @xmath21 , as we shall discuss it in the following .",
    "additionally , photodiode arrays can easily accommodate a small hole to let through the transmitted beam , a crucial requirement for small angle measurements , while this is not possible for a ccd or cmos detector .",
    "thus , existing designs for mals can not be easily generalized to an apparatus for both sls and dls .    in this paper , we present a ccd - based mid - angle light scattering apparatus that covers the intermediate range @xmath0 thanks to a novel optical layout .",
    "our mals setup allows for simultaneous measurements at all accessible scattering angles .",
    "both sls and dls measurements can be performed and no stringent limitations on the sample thickness are imposed .",
    "finally , the setup uses only standard components that are readily available off the shelf .",

    "neglecting refractions at the solvent - cell and cell - air interfaces , a point on @xmath22 at a distance @xmath24 from the optical axis corresponds to a scattering angle @xmath25 . in order to avoid artifacts due to light leaking from the intense transmitted beam",
    ", a hole may be drilled in the detector to let the transmitted beam pass through @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a screen may be placed in the plane @xmath22 and a ccd camera may be used to record the intensity distribution on the screen . in both cases ,",
    "this geometry prevents a ccd camera to be placed directly in the plane @xmath22 , making dls measurements impossible . in addition ,",
    "detectors and lenses used in this configuration must often be custom - made to efficiently remove the transmitted beam and to limit aberrations associated with large scattering angles .",
    "the scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]b , described in refs .",
    "@xcite , is equivalent to the top one , provided that one replaces @xmath23 by the sample - detector distance @xmath26 in the calculation of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that large scattering angles may be attained simply by reducing @xmath26 , without changing @xmath23 and with no stringent requirements on the numerical aperture of the fourier lens .",
    "however , the sample thickness @xmath21 must satisfy @xmath27 , since the mapping between @xmath24 and @xmath8 depends on the distance of a scatterer from @xmath22 .",
    "when using a ccd detector , typical values of @xmath26 are a few cm at most , limiting @xmath21 to about 1 mm . additionally , the remarks on removing the transmitted beam discussed for the top scheme apply also here .",

    "the apparatus maps the cone of light scattered at a given angle @xmath8 onto a ring of ccd pixels centered around the transmitted beam position .",
    "functionally , it may be divided into two parts . the first part is formed by the two pairs of lenses @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are confocal and act as an ( inverted ) telescope .",
    "their purpose is two - fold : on the one hand , they demagnify the angle of the light scattered by the sample , thus mapping the mals range to a more manageable , lower - angle range . on the other hand ,",
    "a beam stop can be conveniently placed in the focal plane @xmath22 common to both pairs , thereby removing the transmitted beam .",

    "this discrepancy is unlikely to stem mainly from a non - uniform angular response of the setup , since the tests with the pinhole and the ground glass suggest that deviations should compensate once integrated over the thickness of the sample .",
    "other possible explanations include deviations from a perfectly spherical particle shape ( as observed in the tem images ) , scattering from the phhs corona that may become non - negligible when matching closely the pmma refractive index , and multiple scattering .",
    "concerning the latter point , we note that although the suspension transmission was very high ( @xmath168 ) , even modest amounts of multiple scattering would tend to increase @xmath53 in those angular ranges where the signal is markedly lower than for nearby @xmath61 vectors , as observed here .",

    "while the fractal regime only extends beyond the particle size and below the aggregate dimension , it is easy to have the @xmath175 regime covering the whole mals range , by choosing appropriately the particle size and the aggregation time . to form the aggregates , we start by preparing a particle suspension of latex spheres with a diameter of @xmath176 in a buoyancy matching mixture of milli - q water and @xmath177 ( 0.5/0.5 v / v ) , at @xmath178 .",

    "the dls and mals data follow the same trend , showing that not only does the ccd - based apparatus capture well the shape and @xmath61 dependence of the correlation functions , but it also measures correctly their decay time on an absolute scale . the line is a power law fit to the data , with a fixed exponent @xmath213 as inferred from diffusive motion , showing overall a very good agreement with both data sets .",
    "the first four points measured by the mals apparatus were not included in the fit , because they slightly deviate from the @xmath214 trend .",
    "this slight discrepancy is most likely due to additional ballistic dynamics that superimpose to the brownian motion and originate from convective motion .",
    "indeed , we find this effect to be even more relevant right after filling the cell , when temperature fluctuations and gradients are not stabilized yet . such ballistic motion ,",
    "while negligible with respect to diffusion on the small length scales probed by traditional dls , become increasingly important as @xmath61 is decreased , since for ballistic motion the relaxation time of @xmath204 scales as @xmath215 , as opposed to @xmath214 for brownian diffusion  @xcite .",
