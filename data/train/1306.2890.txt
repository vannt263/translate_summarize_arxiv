    "the success of the kepler space telescope in detecting planets in circumbinary orbits ( also known as p - type systems ) has opened a new chapter in the studies of planets in binary stars .",
    "although the discovery of p - type planets had been previously announced around eclipsing binaries [ e.g. the binaries nn ser @xcite , uz for @xcite , hu aqu @xcite ] the orbital ( in)stability of these objects cast doubt on their validity @xcite .",
    "the confirmed detection of the seven currently known circumbinary planets , namely kepler 16b @xcite , kepler 34b and kepler 35b @xcite , kepler 38b @xcite , kepler 47b&c @xcite , and kepler 64b @xcite , however , has made it certain that planet formation _ around _ binary star systems is robust , and these systems may host planets of a variety of sizes including terrestrial size .    as the discovery of p - type planetary systems points to the viability of planet formation in circumbinary orbits ,",
    "we address whether these systems can also provide habitable conditions .",
    "similar to single stars , in order for a p - type system to host a rocky planet with habitable conditions , an earth - like planet has to maintain a long - term stable orbit in the binary s habitable zone ( hz ) .",
    "this implies that in order to assess the habitability of a p - type system , one has to first determine the location of its hz .",
    "the latter is the focus of this paper .",
    "we follow our approach as presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , and using the concept of _ spectrally - weighted _ flux , present a comprehensive methodology for calculating the locations of the inner and outer boundaries of the hz in a circumbinary system .    since the announcement of the circumbinary planet kepler-16b",
    ", several efforts have been made to calculate the hz of the currently known p - type systems .",
    "the first attempt was made by @xcite who considered the system of kepler 16 to be equivalent to a single star system for the purpose of calculating its hz .",
    "@xcite also made an effort in calculating the hz of kepler 16 by adopting an equilibrium temperature approach that greatly diverges from the current model of hz as developed by @xcite .",
    "similar approach has recently been taken by @xcite who have also calculated the hz of currently known kepler s circumbinary planetary systems .",
    "a common assumption in all these studies ( which has led to their estimates of the hz to be unreliable ) has been that the equilibrium temperature on the surface of a fictitious earth - like planet is due to the direct summation of the flux of each star of the binary in the planet s orbit . in other words , the effect of the planet s atmosphere and",
    "its response to the radiation from each star has been neglected .",
    "it is , however , known that the atmosphere of a planet plays an important role in its habitability .",
    "the planet s atmosphere is the medium where the stellar radiation is first received and the process of converting from insolation to equilibrium temperature occurs . as stars with different spectral types have different spectral distributions of incident energy , the response of an atmosphere will be different for radiations from different stars .",
    "this implies that stars with different spectral energy distributions ( sed ) contribute differently to the energy absorbed at the top of the planet s atmosphere @xcite . in other words ,",
    "a direct summation of the fluxes received in the location of the planet is not applicable , and in order to obtain the total insulation received by the planet from the two stars of the binary , the flux of each star has to be weighted separately and according to its spectral type .",
    "the total flux received by the planet s atmosphere will then be equal to the sum of the spectrally - weighted flux of each star ( paper i ) .",
    "the fact that the direct summation of fluxes of the two stars of the binary can not be used to determine the binary hz have also been noted in a paper by @xcite .",
    "these authors used the limits of the narrow hz without a cloud feedback [ as calculated by @xcite , converted into flux limits by @xcite , and recently updated by @xcite ] , and determined the total flux at the location of the planet by adding the fluxes of the two stars . to avoid the above - mentioned short - comings",
    ", these authors treated each star as a black body , and defined an effective temperature that would allow for replacing the sum of the fluxes of the two stars by the flux from a single source with an equivalent energy .",
    "while this approach results in a more reliable determination of the binary hz than those in the previously mentioned studies , the fact that the equivalent source of energy has been defined by using the direct summations of the fluxes of the two stars still does not allow for the effect of the sed of each star on the total flux absorbed by the planet s atmosphere to be taken into account . as a result , this method , too , does not address the effect of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "in this paper , we present a solution to this problem by introducing a comprehensive analytical approach to the calculation of the hz in a circumbinary system which directly takes into account the contribution of each star due to its physical properties ( including its sed ) , as well as its motion in the binary system .",
    "to determine the location and range of the circumbinary hz , similar to the calculations of hz around single stars , we consider a fictitious earth - like planet with a co@xmath0/h@xmath0o / n@xmath0 atmosphere , and use the most recent model of sun s hz developed by @xcite to identify regions around the binary system where the total flux at the top of the planet s atmosphere will be equal to that of the earth at the inner and outer boundaries of the sun s hz .",
    "considering such an earth analog in a p - type system is equivalent to assuming that earth - like planets can in fact form in circumbinary orbits .",
    "although at the time of the writing of this article , no earth - like planets had been detected around binary stars , simulations of the last stage of the formation of terrestrial planets indicate that terrestrial - size object can in fact form and maintain stability in circumbinary orbits .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive review , in particular chapter 1 on potentially planet - forming circumbinary disks , and chapters 10 and 11 on the formation and stability of planets in p - type systems . in this study , we assume that despite some recent unsuccessful efforts in modeling the formation of p - type planets @xcite , the detection of giant planets in p - type orbits is an indication that planet formation can proceed efficiently in circumbinary disks , and earth - like planets can form in orbits around a binary star system .",
    "figure 1 shows the orbit of a planet in a p - type system .",
    "as shown in the top panel of this figure , the two stars of the binary revolve around their center of mass ( shown by com ) .",
    "in general , the orbit of the planet is around the center of mass of the entire three body system of primary - secondary - planet .",
    "however , due to the negligible mass of the planet compared to those of the binary stars , the center of mass of the entire system is considered to be the same as the center of mass of the binary ( com ) . also , it is customary to assume that the primary is at rest and both the secondary and planet orbit a stationary primary ( bottom panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "as explained in the next section , in this paper we follow this convention .",
    "it is important to note that the orbit of a planet in a p - type system , in addition to the inherent ( in)stability associated with circumbinary orbits ( i.e. , the @xmath1 mean - motion resonances for @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is also driven by the extent of the circumbinary disk in which the planet is formed .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the interaction between the stars of a binary and the disk results in disk truncation and the removal of planet - forming material from the inner part of the disk . this effect is stronger in binaries with larger eccentricities causing the inner boundary of the disk and the stability limit to be slightly outside the influence zone of the binary stars .",
    "the latter implies that circumbinary planets can theoretically form around binaries with variety of eccentricities ( a survey of the currently known p - type systems shows that the binary eccentricity can be as high as 0.52 in the case of kepler 34 ) . in binaries with high eccentricity ,",
    "the close approach of the binary stars to a planet can change the flux contribution of each of the binary stars to the overall flux received by the planet , substantially .",
    "this effect combined with the response of the planet s atmosphere to the radiation received from each star defines the hz around the binary system . in this paper , we present a general methodology for calculating the boundaries of the hz in a p - type system by taking the dynamical and physical characteristics of each star into account .",
    "we describe our model and present the calculations of the hz in section 2 . in section 3 , we apply our methodology to the currently known p - type systems detected by the kepler space telescope .",
    "since the goal of our study is only to determine the location of the hz , we do not consider the known planets in these systems .",
    "instead we assume a fictitious earth - like planet with a co@xmath0/h@xmath0o / n@xmath0 atmosphere ( kasting et al .",
    "1993 , selsis et al .",
    "2007 , and kaltenegger & sasselov 2011 ) in a circumbinary orbit around these binaries and determine the distances at which such a planet would both be dynamically stable and receive a combined stellar flux according to the flux in the hz . in section 4 , we conclude this study by summarizing the results and discussing their implications .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , to determine the boundaries of the hz , we adopt the same model and methodology as in paper i. we consider a circumstellar hz to be an annulus around a star where an earth - like planet with a co@xmath0/h@xmath0o / n@xmath0 atmosphere and sufficient amount of water can permanently maintain liquid water on its solid surface .",
    "we also assume that similar to earth , geophysical cycles in this planet regulate the amount of its atmospheric co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o , and as a result , the locations of the inner and outer boundaries of its hz will be associated with co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o  dominated atmospheres , respectively .",
    "in such a planet , the concentration of atmospheric co@xmath0 varies inversely with the surface temperature . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the model recently proposed by @xcite as the the model for the sun s hz without cloud feedback . in this model",
    ", a narrow hz is defined as the region with an inner boundary at the runaway greenhouse limit , and an outer boundary at the distance where earth will develop its maximum greenhouse effect .",
    "note that the inner and outer boundaries of a narrow hz are also without cloud feedback .",
    "we use the distances presented by these authors as recent venus and early mars for an empirical ( nominal ) hz .",
    "these boundaries have been derived from the fluxes received by mars at 3.5 gy and by venus at 1.0 gy , at the time when both planets do not show indications for liquid water on their surfaces @xcite .",
    "the locations of the boundaries of the hz and therefore , the capability of a planet in maintaining conditions for habitability depend on the total flux received at the top of the planet s atmosphere .",
    "since the atmosphere converts stellar insolation to temperature structure and surface temperature of a planet , its interaction with the stellar radiation plays an important role in considering if a planet can maintain liquid water on its surface and allow for detectable habitable conditions .",
    "this interaction strongly depends on the stellar sed implying that stars with different energy distributions will contribute differently to the absolute incident flux at the top of the planet s atmosphere . to determine the contribution of a star taking into account its sed",
    ", we define the quantity _ spectral weight factor _ @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denoting the primary and secondary stars , respectively , @xmath5 is the star s effective temperature , and @xmath6 represents the atmosphere s cloud fraction .",
    "as shown in paper i and following @xcite ,    @xmath7^{-1}}\\,,\\ ] ]    where    @xmath8    in these equations , x=(in , out ) denotes the inner and outer boundaries of the hz , @xmath9 are in au , and @xmath10 .",
    "the values of coefficients @xmath11 , and @xmath12 depend on the boundary of the sun s hz and are given in table 1 @xcite .",
    "the graphs of the corresponding spectral weight factors of these models are shown in the top panel of figure 2 .",
    "given the concept of spectral weight factor as introduced in the previous section , the contribution of each star of the binary to the total flux at the top of the planet s atmosphere can be written as @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath14 denotes the stellar flux and @xmath15 is the luminosity of each star of the binary .",
    "the total flux received by the planet is , therefore , given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the distances between the planet and the primary and secondary stars , respectively .",
    "defining hz as a region where the total flux received by an earth - like planet at that top of its atmosphere is equal to that of earth received from the sun , the boundaries of the hz of the binary can be calculated from    @xmath19    in deriving this equation , we have assumed that the primary star is at the center of the coordinates system ( see the lower panel of figure 1 ) and the boundaries of the hz of the binary @xmath20 are measured with respect to this star .    as shown by equation ( 4 ) ,",
    "calculations of the boundaries of hz require calculating the distance between the secondary star and the earth - like planet @xmath21 .",
    "as shown by the bottom panel of figure 1 , this quantity can be written as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the true anomaly of the binary , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . in a circumbinary system , where the planet is subject to the gravitational forces of two stars , the angle @xmath26 can be calculated using planet s equation of motion .",
    "recently , @xcite have presented an elegant analytical treatment of the orbit of a planet in a p - type system . while the methodology and solutions presented by these authors can be used to calculate @xmath26 , we present here an approach that is more efficient when used in numerical computations .    in general , the equation of motion of a planet in a circumbinary orbit , as shown in the lower panel of figure 1 , can be written as    @xmath27    in equation ( 6 ) , are the vectors connecting the planet to the binary stars , @xmath28 represents stellar masses , and @xmath29 is the gravitational constant .",
    "considering a plane - polar coordinates system ( which would be consistent with the co - planarity of kepler circumbinary planets ) , equation ( 6 ) can be written as    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32 \\,,\\ ] ]    @xmath33    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and we have set @xmath36 .",
    "the boundaries of the hz of the binary can be calculated by simultaneously solving equations ( 4 ) and ( 7 - 10 ) , substituting for @xmath37from equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the solutions of equations ( 4 ) and ( 7 - 10 ) present the actual motion of a planet in a circumbinary orbit . in the context of calculating the binary s hz , the latter means , unlike the usual practice of constraining the orbit of the fictitious earth - like planet to a circle",
    ", the orbit of this planet will be affected by the dynamics of the binary and may not stay circular . as a result , as shown in the next section , depending on the contribution of each star and the binary eccentricity , the shape of the ( instantaneous ) hz may also deviate from a circle and may vary during the motion of the binary .",
    "the binary eccentricity will also play an important role in the formation and stability of the planet . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the interaction between the binary and a disk of circumbinary objects causes the disk to be truncated and lose some of its planet - forming material . as a result of the disk truncation , the inner edge of the disk will move out to the location of the boundary of the stability given by @xcite    @xmath38    in this equation , @xmath39 is the binary mass - ratio and is equal to @xmath40 . as shown by equation",
    "( 11 ) , the location of the stability region is strongly affected by the eccentricity of the binary . in binaries with large eccentricities",
    ", this region moves to large distances implying that ( depending on the spectral types of the stars of the binary ) the system may not be able to form potentially habitable planets .",
    "one can use equation ( 11 ) to determine the range of the binary eccentricity for which a planet in the hz of the binary will be stable .",
    "for instance in the case of the narrow hz , for a binary with a given mass - ratio @xmath39 , the lower ( upper ) limit of the eccentricity corresponds to a value for which the boundary of stability coincides with the inner ( outer ) edge of the hz .",
    "in this section , we calculate the boundaries of narrow and empirical hzs of the currently known kepler circumbinary planetary systems . using the model by @xcite , we consider the narrow hz ( without cloud feedback ) of a sun - like star to extend from 0.97 au to 1.67 au , and its empirical hz to be from 0.75 au to 1.77 au",

    "the discovery of the currently known p - type systems lends strong support to the fact that planet formation can start and efficiently continue in circumbinary orbits .",
    "simulations of the final stage of terrestrial planet formation have shown that subsequent to the disk truncation , planetesimals and protoplanetary bodies can successfully grow to terrestrial - class objects and reside in long - term stable orbits . in binaries",
    "whose eccentricities allow the hz to be stable , terrestrial / earth - like planet formation proceeds similar to planet formation around single stars .",
