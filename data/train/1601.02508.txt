    "laughlin s plasma analogy , originating in  @xcite , consists in writing @xmath112 as a gibbs state for a classical electrostatic hamiltonian @xmath113 . in this convention ,",
    "the partition function is @xmath114 and the temperature is @xmath13 .",
    "explicitly we have @xmath115 which can be regarded as the hamiltonian for @xmath6 2d classical charged particles in a quadratic external potential , interacting via repulsive coulomb forces .",
    "the quasi - holes / tracer particles appear in this representation as fixed repulsive point charges whose influence is felt by the bath particles .",
    "thus , @xmath116 is characterized as the probability measure minimizing the free energy @xmath117 = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^{2n } } { h^{\\mathrm{plas}}}(y_n ) \\mu ( y_n ) dy_n + \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^{2n } } \\mu \\log \\mu\\ ] ] and the minimum free energy @xmath118 satisfies @xmath119 without further approximations , this rewriting is not particularly useful , but the point is that we may use the good scaling properties of @xmath47 , inherited from the fact that it is of the form polynomial @xmath120 gaussian . indeed , scaling length units by a factor @xmath121 transforms the limit @xmath122 for the effective plasma problem into a mean - field / small temperature regime .",
    "that is , it gets mapped to yet another equilibrium statistical mechanics problem , but this time with a coupling constant @xmath123 and an effective temperature @xmath123 .",
    "since the minimization of   can be mapped to a mean - field / small temperature regime by a simple change of scale , it is reasonable to use an ansatz of the form @xmath124 and neglect the entropy to perform the minimization .",
    "we refer to  @xcite where this approximation is rigorously justified for related models , and to  @xcite for numerical confirmation . making this manipulation leads to a classical mean - field energy functional @xmath125 = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^2 } \\left ( \\frac{b}{2}|{\\mathbf{x}}| ^2 - 2 \\sum_{j=1}^m \\log |{\\mathbf{x}}-{\\mathbf{x}}_j| \\right ) \\rho ( { \\mathbf{x } } )",

    "what remains to be discussed is the explicit expression for @xmath81 ( right - hand side of ) that we have used in the main text .",
    "note that the density profile for the tracer particles is obtained in the same way , by a simple change of units .",
    "recall that the expression is clearly physically sound : the @xmath129 term in the energy functional   corresponds to the potential generated by a constant background of charge density @xmath130 ( in somewhat arbitrary units ) .",
    "each tracer particle / quasi - hole corresponds to a fixed point with charge @xmath131 , and the bath particles have charge @xmath132 in this representation .",
    "each tracer particle thus screens the background charge in a disk of radius @xmath133 around it , and the bath particles distribute in order to screen the remaining background density .    for a more rigorous derivation ,",
    "note that the minimizer @xmath81 for   must satisfy the variational inequality @xmath134 with equality on the support of @xmath81 .",
    "here , @xmath135 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "a useful result is the following ( see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we consider a thought experiment where two distinct species of 2d particles in a perpendicular magnetic field interact via repulsive potentials . </S>",
    "<S> if the magnetic field and the interactions are strong enough , one type of particles forms a laughlin state and the other ones couple to laughlin quasi - holes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in this situation , the motion of the second type of particles is described by an effective hamiltonian , corresponding to the magnetic gauge picture for non - interacting anyons . </S>",
    "<S> the argument is in accord with , but distinct from , the berry phase calculation of arovas - schrieffer - wilczek . </S>",
    "<S> it suggests possibilities to observe the influence of effective anyon statistics in fractional quantum hall systems .    the basic explanation for the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite is the occurence of strongly correlated fluids as the ground states of 2d electron gases under strong perpendicular magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the elementary excitations ( quasi - particles ) of these peculiar states of matter carry a fraction of an electron s charge , leading to the quantization of the hall conductance in certain fractions of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> even more fascinating is the possibility that these quasi - particles may have fractional statistics , i.e. a behavior under continuous exchanges that interpolates between that of bosons and that of fermions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been proposed  @xcite that this physics could be emulated in ultra - cold atomic gases subjected to artificial magnetic fields .    the main evidence for the emergence of fractional statistics concerns the quasi - hole excitations of the laughlin wave functions  @xcite , which occur when the filling factor @xmath1 of the 2d electron gas is the inverse of an odd integer . based on a berry phase calculation , </S>",
    "<S> arovas , schrieffer and wilczek  @xcite argued that a continuous , adiabatic , exchange of two such quasi - holes leads the electrons wave function to pick up a phase factor @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that if the quasi - holes are to be considered as genuine quantum particles , they should be treated as anyons with statistics parameter @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> while this constitutes a powerful argument , a more direct derivation of the emergence of fractional statistics seems desirable ( see e.g. the discussion in  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed not entirely obvious that one should identify the change in the phase of the electrons wave function with the statistics parameter attributed to the quasi - holes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the most striking consequences of quantum statistics  the presence or absence of an exclusion principle ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , of condensation or a degeneracy pressure  are statistical mechanics effects that can not be observed by measuring berry phases .    </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been proposed  @xcite that the fractional statistics of quantum hall quasi - particles could be probed by observing the behavior of test particles immersed in an atomic gas forming a quantum hall droplet . </S>",
    "<S> it thus seems timely to revisit the emergence of fractional statistics in this context .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present a derivation of the anyonic nature of the laughlin quasi - holes that does not appeal to the berry phase concept , and suggest a mechanism by which the statistical mechanics influence of the anyon statistics could be directly ascertained . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is to derive explicitly an effective , emergent , hamiltonian for the test particles , see equation   below . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose an ansatz   for its ground state in a specific experimental regime , and compute the associated density  , a measurable quantity one could use to probe the emergence of fractional statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider , as in the proposals  @xcite , two different species of interacting 2d particles . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of particles of the first type and @xmath6 the number of particles of the second type . </S>",
    "<S> for definiteness we assume that the two types of particles be bosons , whence the imposed symmetry in the above hilbert spaces . </S>",
    "<S> the following however applies to any choice of statistics for both types of particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we write the hamiltonian for the full system as ( spin is neglected ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian for the first type of particles and @xmath9 that for the second type of particles . we shall denote @xmath10 and @xmath11 the coordinates of the two types of particles and choose units so that @xmath12 , and the mass and charge of the _ second _ type of particles are respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we keep the freedom that the first type of particles might have a different mass @xmath15 and a different charge @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the first type of particles should be thought of as tracers immersed in a large sea of the second type . </S>",
    "<S> we shall accordingly use the terms `` tracer particles '' and `` bath particles '' in the sequel .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also introduced :    * the usual momenta @xmath17 and @xmath18 . * a uniform magnetic field of strength @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> our convention is that it points downwards : @xmath20 * intra - species interaction potentials , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> * an inter - species interaction potential @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> the splitting between landau levels of the one - body hamiltonian appearing in @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath25 , and we assume that it is large enough to force all bath particles to live in the lowest landau level ( lll ) @xmath26 note that the splitting between landau levels for the tracer particles is rather proportional to @xmath27 so if @xmath28 it is reasonable to allow that they occupy several landau levels .    if in addition the bath particles interaction potential @xmath22 is sufficiently repulsive , we are led to an ansatz of the form @xmath29 for the joint wave function of the full system , where @xmath30 is a laughlin wave function : @xmath31 with the coordinates @xmath32 identified with @xmath33 . to stay within the allowed hilbert space </S>",
    "<S> one must impose that @xmath34 in   be holomorphic in @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that tuning the integer @xmath36 allows to completely cancel the interaction @xmath22 between particles of the second type . </S>",
    "<S> it is for example the case if @xmath22 has zero range and @xmath36 is large enough  @xcite . in the context of  , @xmath36 should be even , @xmath37 being the most relevant case . for 2d electron gases , </S>",
    "<S> the second hilbert space should be antisymmetric and @xmath36 should be odd . </S>",
    "<S> the filling factor is then @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we consider the situation where the inter - species interaction potential @xmath23 is strong enough to force the joint wave function of the system to vanish whenever particles of different species meet , i.e. @xmath39 for all @xmath40 . since @xmath41 must stay within the lowest landau level of the bath particles , this forces the form @xmath42 where we identify @xmath43 with @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that choosing such an ansatz cancels the inter - species interaction , i.e. that the latter is sufficiently short range . </S>",
    "<S> then , all terms of the total hamiltonian acting on the bath particles are frozen and thus @xmath34 depends only on @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to our final ansatz @xmath46 where @xmath47 describes a laughlin state of the @xmath6 bath particles , coupled to @xmath5 quasi - holes at the locations of the tracer particles : @xmath48 here we choose @xmath49 to enforce @xmath50 for any @xmath51 . we thus ensure normalization of the full wave function @xmath41 by demanding that @xmath52    we next argue that , for a wave function of the form   and if @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 for an effective hamiltonian @xmath56 , so that the physics is completely reduced to the motion of the tracer particles . in this description , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction with the bath particles boils down to the emergence of effective magnetic fields in @xmath56 : @xmath57 here the original potentials @xmath58 and @xmath21 are inherited from  , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 emerge from the interaction with the bath particles . </S>",
    "<S> the subscripts stand for `` renormalizing '' and `` anyon '' vector potentials respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have the expressions @xmath61 for some @xmath62 to be defined below , and @xmath63 with the ( conveniently scaled ) magnetic length @xmath64 everywhere in the paper we denote @xmath65 the disk of center @xmath66 and radius @xmath67 , and @xmath68 the corresponding indicator function ( equal to @xmath13 in the disk and @xmath69 outside ) .    note that @xmath59 corresponds to a constant magnetic field supported in a large disk , @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath60 is generated by aharonov - bohm - like units of flux attached to the tracer particles locations : @xmath71 in this convention , the wave function @xmath34 still has the symmetry imposed at the outset , and the above thus describes anyons in the magnetic gauge picture  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the aharonov - bohm magnetic fluxes are naturally smeared over a certain length scale in the above ( extended anyons model  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the derivation strictly speaking requires that the disks in   do not overlap , e.g. that the interaction potential @xmath21 contains a sufficiently extended hard core . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by newton s theorem one may replace @xmath72 finally , we shall see below that for @xmath73 , @xmath62 is typically very large , so that one might want to further approximate @xmath74 the effect of this field is thus to reduce the value of the external one . </S>",
    "<S> this charge renormalization is due to the fractional charge associated with laughlin quasi - holes .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn to vindicating our claim  . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , it is sufficient to show that , for any @xmath75 we have essentially @xmath76 indeed , inserting this in the expression for the energy and recalling   we may integrate first in the @xmath77 variables to deduce  . </S>",
    "<S> the constant in   is just the lll energy of the @xmath6 bath particles .    </S>",
    "<S> we need to recall a few facts about the laughlin and quasi - holes wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote @xmath78 the one - particle density of the quasi - holes ansatz , @xmath79 which implicitly depends on @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> laughlin s plasma analogy ( see the appendix for details ) provides reasonable approximations for @xmath78 and @xmath80 in terms of an auxiliary classical mean - field problem , whose density we denote @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , assuming @xmath54 and @xmath53 , we approximate @xmath82 with @xmath83 we also assume that the disks @xmath84 in   do not overlap , e.g. because the tracer particles feel a hard core preventing them from getting too close to one another . </S>",
    "<S> one might still proceed without these assumptions , but we shall stick to the simplest case in this letter . applying the feynman - hellmann principle to the effective plasma also leads to a useful approximation for the derivatives of @xmath80 with respect to the location of the tracer particles : @xmath85    with these approximations at hand we can proceed to the derivation of   where , from now on and without loss of generality , we take @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , @xmath87 a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the basis vectors in @xmath91 . in the state @xmath41 , the bath particles @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> are distributed according to the density @xmath78 , so that we may safely approximate @xmath92 for the purpose of computing  . inserting in the above , recalling  , </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the real part of @xmath93 cancels with @xmath94 , leading to @xmath95 where @xmath96 inserting the expression   of @xmath81 yields @xmath97 the second term is clearly @xmath69 , while the first and third terms give the contributions of   and   respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this closes the argument establishing  , and   follows because of  .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss possible measurable consequences of the above derivation . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian   is notoriously hard to solve , even at the ground state level ( see  @xcite for reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can however use certain known results for comparisons with experiments . for illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we shall consider a case where the comparison seems the most simple and direct . </S>",
    "<S> we have a cold atoms system in mind , with both types of particles being bosons held by a harmonic confinement @xmath98 the ( artificial ) magnetic field can be imposed by rotating the trap or by more elaborate means  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the previous discussion is unchanged if the energy scale associated with the trap is smaller than those entering the derivation , thus the effective hamiltonian for the tracer particles is  , supplemented by @xmath15 times the trapping term . as previously discussed we use the expressions   and   for the effective fields . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath27 is large compared to the trapping energy , it makes sense to project this hamiltonian onto the lll of the associated effective magnetic field , of strength @xmath99 the associated free hamiltonian ( case @xmath100 ) is then essentially exactly soluble ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of a weak interaction potential @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> , it is reasonable to expect that the ground state is also dictated by the free hamiltonian , namely @xmath101 see  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * equations ( 6 ) and ( 36 ) to ( 38 ) ) . we have denoted @xmath102 an effective trapping frequency and @xmath103 a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> note that since   vanishes at @xmath104 , we expect that this ansatz is still reasonable in the presence of a repulsive potential @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> as a possible probe of the situation just discussed , we note that if the state of the full system is given by  -- , the one - particle density of the tracer particles can be approximated , for large @xmath5 , as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is fixed by normalization . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the same kind of considerations that lead to  , see the appendix for details . both the distinctive flat profile and the ( length and density ) scales involved are signatures of the effective anyon hamiltonian , and thus its emergence can be directly seen in a measurement of the density profile of the tracer particles . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , both the gaussian profile one would get for free bosons in the lll , and the thomas - fermi - like profile in the presence of weak pair interactions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , differ markedly from  .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions*. assuming an ansatz of the form   for the joint wave function of the system , we have demonstrated that the tracer particles feel an effective magnetic hamiltonian  . </S>",
    "<S> the latter contains long - range magnetic interactions whose form is identical to those appearing in the `` magnetic gauge picture '' description of anyons with statistics parameter @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> one may thus ( formally ) extract from @xmath34 a phase factor to gauge @xmath60 away ( singular gauge transformation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian is then a usual magnetic laplacian , with reduced magnetic field , but the effective wave function ( formally ) picks up a factor of @xmath108 upon exchanging two particles , hence describes anyons .    </S>",
    "<S> the assumptions we made are consistent with those of the usual berry phase calculation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the energy scales associated to the effective hamiltonian we derived should be smaller than the energy gap above the ground state ansatz  .    </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning we proposed suggests a way to probe the anyon statistics , by a direct observation of the collective behavior of the tracer particles . </S>",
    "<S> if they are originally bosons , they will acquire some form of exclusion principle  @xcite whose influence could be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed a possible set - up where simple calculations show measurable effects of the emergent fractional statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of more general situations will demand further studies of the trapped anyon gas ( see however  @xcite and references therein for the discussion of approximate models ) . </S>",
    "<S> this remains a topic for future investigation , as does a more mathematically rigorous derivation of the phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> as for possible generalizations , non - abelian quantum hall states as considered in  @xcite are not currently covered by our methods . however , </S>",
    "<S> if one is willing to take for granted , or argue for , appropriate replacements to  - , the approach applies to the case where the bath particles form another abelian quantum hall state , such as a composite fermions state as discussed in  @xcite .    </S>",
