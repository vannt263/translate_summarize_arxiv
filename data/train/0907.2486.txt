    "one of the most surprising discoveries at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is that the hot and dense matter ( believed to be a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , see gyulassy:2004zy , shuryak:2004cy , stoecker:2004qu , jacobs:2004qv for reviews ) formed in collisions appears to be a near - perfect fluid rhic , huovinen:2001cy , molnar:2001ux , teaney:2000cw , hirano:2002ds , teaney:2003pb , muronga:2004sf , heinz:2005bw , romatschke:2007mq .",
    "the remanent of the non - central collisions shows collective motion ( elliptic flow ) with a shear viscosity ( @xmath5 ) to entropy density ( @xmath11 ) ratio @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath2 ratio is close to a conjectured minimum bound @xmath13 kovtun:2004de , which is motivated by uncertainty principle danielewicz:1984ww and gauge / string duality policastro:2001yc , policastro:2002se , herzog:2002fn , buchel:2003tz . since smaller @xmath2 implies stronger particle interactions , contrary to the conventional picture , the qgp produced at rhic tends to be a strongly interacting fluid instead of a weakly interacting gas .",
    "however , a recent perturbative qcd calculation  of @xmath2 of a gluon plasma by xu and greiner ( xg ) @xcite indicates that the gluon elastic scattering @xmath3 does not give the dominant contribution .",
    "they found that @xmath2 for the gluon bremsstrahlung process @xmath6 is about 1/7 of that for @xmath3 , which means the contribution to the shear viscosity from @xmath6 is 7 times as important as that from @xmath3 .",
    "this would bring @xmath2 down to @xmath13 when strong coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "this implies that the near - perfect qgp might still be described by perturbative qcd and that the conventional picture could still be valid .",
    "their conclusion is quite different from an earlier study by arnold , moore and yaffe ( amy ) @xcite ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "amy found that @xmath6 only contributes at @xmath15 level for the three flavor quark diffusion constant for @xmath16 .",
    "for comparison , xg have @xmath17  at @xmath9 , while amy have @xmath18  ( note that only @xmath5  was computed in @xcite , the free gluon @xmath11  is inserted by us for comparison ) .",
    "both approaches of xg and amy are based on kinetic theory .",
    "however , the main points of differences are : 1 ) a parton cascade model @xcite is used by xg to solve the boltzmann equation . since the bosonic nature of gluons is hard to implement in real time simulations in this model , gluons are treated as a boltzmann gas ( i.e. a classical gas ) . for amy , the boltzmann equation is solved in a variation method without taking the boltzmann gas approximation .",
    "2 ) the @xmath19 processes , @xmath20 , are approximated by the effective @xmath21 splitting in amy where the two gluons are nearly collinear with a small splitting angle , while the @xmath6  process is used in xg where the bremsstrahlung gluon is soft but it can have a large splitting angle with its mother gluon . more specifically , in xg , the gunion - bertsch formula @xcite for the @xmath4  matrix element squared in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix - e ] ) is used .",
    "this formula is valid for the limit of soft but not necessarily collinear gluon bremsstrahlung . for the phase space",
    ", xg uses the exact phase space for the three gluon configurations ( called three - body - likephase space in this paper ) . in principle , if the soft bremsstrahlung limit is a good approximation of the @xmath4 process , one should be able to impose the same limit to the phase space as well and get approximately the same result . in this limit , the recoil effect from the bremsstrahlung gluon is neglected , and the phase space ( for the two hard gluons ) is called two - body - like  here .    in this paper , we will perform a third independent calculation for comparison .",
    "we will use the same inputs on the gunion - bertsch formula for the gluon scattering amplitudes ( modulo a factor 2 in eq . (",
    "[ eq : matrix - e ] ) ) with the soft gluon bremsstrahlung approximation as xg but we will solve the boltzmann equation variationally as amy without taking the boltzmann gas approximation . we will also test the robustness of the soft gluon bremsstrahlung approximation by comparing the results with the two- and three - body - like phase space .",
    "using the kubo formula , @xmath5 can be calculated through the linearized response function of a thermal equilibrium state @xmath22 \\rangle , \\]]where @xmath23 is the spatial part of the off - diagonal energy momentum tensor . in a leading order ( lo )",
    "expansion of the coupling constant , there are an infinite number of diagrams @xcite .",
    "however , it is proven that the summation of the lo diagrams in a weakly coupled @xmath24 theory jeon or in hot qed @xcite is equivalent to solving the linearized boltzmann equation with temperature - dependent particle masses and scattering amplitudes .",
    "the conclusion is expected to hold in weakly coupled systems and can as well be used to compute the lo transport coefficients in qcd - like theories @xcite , hadronic gases prakash:1993bt , dobado:2003wr , dobado:2001jf , chen:2006iga , chen:2007xe , itakura:2007mx and weakly coupled scalar field theories @xcite .",
    "the boltzmann equation of a hot gluon plasma describes the evolution of the color averaged gluon distribution function @xmath25 ( a function of space , time and momentum ) as heinz:1984yq , elze:1986qd , blaizot:1999xk , baier:2000sb , wang:2001 dm @xmath26 ,   \\label{boltzmann}\\]]where @xmath27 for massless gluons . the driving force for the evolution is the particle scattering in the microscopic theory described by the collision term @xmath28 which is a functional of @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that , to compute @xmath5 to lo in the coupling constant @xmath30 , we need to include @xmath3 and @xmath6 scattering in @xmath28 baier:2000sb , arnold:2002zm",
    ". we will show this more explicitly later . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the gluon distribution @xmath31 is static , homogeneous and isotropic and hence @xmath32 at every @xmath33 .",
    "this implies @xmath34=0 $ ] or detailed balance whose solution is just the bose - einstein distribution function @xmath35 .",
    "when the system is not in thermal equilibrium , there will be momentum flow due to the breakdown of detailed balance .",
    "the momentum flow can be characterized by a velocity field @xmath36 .",
    "the deviation from thermal equilibrium can be characterized by the inhomogeneity of @xmath36 or the derivative expansions of @xmath36 . for simplicity , we work in the comoving frame of the fluid element at point @xmath37 with @xmath38 and to the order of first derivatives of @xmath39 .",
    "thus the distribution function can be parametrized as@xmath40 ,   \\label{fp}\\]]where @xmath41}\\nabla _ { \\lbrack i}v_{j]}\\right ] /t\\ ,",

    "note that the time derivatives do not appear because they can be related to the spatial derivatives by virtue of the conservation of energy momentum tensor .",

    "following the standard procedure ( see e.g. @xcite ) and making use of the boltzmann equation satisfied by @xmath49 , eq.([eta1 ] ) can be recast into @xmath50^{2 } \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{n_{g}^{2}\\beta } { 120}\\int \\prod_{i=1}^{5}\\frac{d^{3}\\mathbf{p}_{i}}{(2\\pi ) ^{3}2e_{i}}|m_{12\\rightarrow 345}|^{2}(2\\pi ) ^{4}\\delta ^{4}(p_{1}+p_{2}-p_{3}-p_{4}-p_{5})(1+f_{1}^{0})(1+f_{2}^{0})f_{3}^{0}f_{4}^{0}f_{5}^{0 } \\notag \\\\ & & \\times \\lbrack b_{ij}(p_{5})+b_{ij}(p_{4})+b_{ij}(p_{3})-b_{ij}(p_{2})-b_{ij}(p_{1})]^{2 } , \\label{eta2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are amplitudes for @xmath3 and @xmath4 processes ( or called 22 and 23 processes in this paper ) , respectively .",
    "one useful observation is that the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eta1 ] ) and ( [ eta2 ] ) correspond to integrations over both sides of the boltzmann equation , or equivalently , a projection of the boltzmann equation .",
    "it is certainly easier to solve the projected equation than the boltzmann equation itself .",
    "however , there would be an infinite number of solutions satisfying the projected equation , even though the true solution is unique , corresponding to that which gives the largest @xmath5 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this makes solving @xmath5 a variational problem .    to solve for @xmath49 , we assume it to be a smooth function which can be expanded in a set of orthogonal polynomials , @xmath54 where @xmath55",
    ", @xmath56 is a polynomial up to @xmath57 and the overall factor @xmath58 will be chosen by trial and error to get the fastest convergence @xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 polynomials can be constructed using the condition @xmath59one can solve the coefficients @xmath60 by equating eqs .",
    "( [ eta1 ] ) and ( [ eta2 ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath5 is just proportional to @xmath61 according to eqs .",
    "( [ eta1 ] ) and ( [ ortho ] ) .",
    "for practical reasons , one uses the approximation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a finite , positive integer .",
    "it can be proved that @xmath5 is an increasing function of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , one can systematically approach the true value of @xmath5 . for @xmath64",
    ", the series converges rapidly . from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , @xmath5 only changes by @xmath67 .    in vacuum , @xmath68 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in medium , @xmath69 .",
    "the most singular part of @xmath70 comes from the colinear region ( i.e. either @xmath71  or @xmath72 ) which can be regularized by the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) dressed propagators for gluons .",
    "however xg only used the debye mass @xmath73 as the regulator just as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , so for the sake of comparison between amy and xg , we also use @xmath74 as the regulator for soft and collinear divergences in this paper .",
    "we will use the htl gluon propagators in one of our future study .",
    "thus , we consider the near collinear approximation @xmath75 in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame , we can use the crossed symmetry between the @xmath76- and @xmath77-channels and just use two times of the forward angle , @xmath77-channel contribution for the sum of the forward ( @xmath77-channel ) and backward ( @xmath76-channel ) angle contributions@xmath78where @xmath79  is the transverse ( with respect to @xmath80 ) component of @xmath81 . because small @xmath79  could also come from large @xmath82  through the @xmath76-channel , it is important to note that when using eq .",
    "( [ m22 ] ) to calculate the collisional integral , we only pick up the near forward scattering ( around @xmath83 ) to avoid double counting .    for the @xmath4 process",
    ", we will take the approximation that the bremsstrahlung gluon is very soft ( zero rapidity limit ) and @xmath84 is much bigger than all transverse momenta .",
    "then the exact result of ref .",
    "ellis:1985er reduces to the gunion - bertsch formula @xcite , @xmath85}\\right\\vert _",
    "{ q^{2}\\approx 0}\\ , \\label{eq : matrix - e}\\]]where we have inserted the regulator @xmath86 as in ref",
    ". biro:1993qt . here",
    "@xmath87  is the transverse component of the bremsstrahlung gluon momentum ( @xmath88 ) and @xmath89  is still the transverse component of @xmath81 .",
    "the three final state gluons are identical particles .",
    "thus , there are 3 ! permutations of @xmath90 , each gives the same contribution .",
    "as explained above in the 22 case , we need to be careful about using the @xmath79  variable .",
    "small @xmath79  could mean either the forward ( @xmath71  ) or backward ( @xmath72 ) scattering . in the convention adopted for eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix - e ] ) , one can only pick up the near forward scattering ( around @xmath83 ) but not the backward scattering otherwise double counting will happen .",
    "our @xmath91  is derived from the exact result of ref .",
    "ellis:1985er , where lorentz invariant mandelstam variables are used so there is no this ambiguity , after taking the soft bremsstrahlung limit .",
    "( [ eq : matrix - e ] ) is also consistent with the gunion - bertsch formula gunion:1981qs as explicitly demonstrated in app .",
    "[ sec - sig23 gb ] .",
    "effectively , the above treatment of collisional integrals leads to a factor 2 difference in the @xmath4 contribution to @xmath5 from that of xg @xcite ( ours is one half of xg s ) .",
    "naively the @xmath3 collision rate is @xmath92 and the @xmath93 rate is @xmath94 ( as will be discussed below , @xmath95 has an @xmath96 infrared ( ir ) cut - off ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 process seems more important than @xmath6 .",
    "however , this is incorrect . in @xmath3 ,",
    "the amplitude is the largest in the forward and backward scatterings .",
    "but there is no contribution to @xmath5 in these cases since there is no momentum redistribution .",
    "mathematically , we have the additional suppression factor @xmath97^{2}\\simeq o(q_{t}^{2})$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eta2 ] ) , while no similar suppression in @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 collision rate is proportional to @xmath98 , which is of the same order as @xmath99 of @xmath6 , up to a logarithm arnold:2000dr , arnold:2003zc .    this power counting can be used to argue that other processes such as @xmath100  and @xmath101  ( called 33 and 24 processes ) are higher order under the assumption that the most important contribution to @xmath5  comes from the configurations with at most two hard gluons in the initial or the final states . under this momentum configuration",
    ", one observes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix - e ] )  that adding a soft gluon to the 22 process yields a factorizable form for the 23 matrix element squared .",
    "schematically , @xmath102where @xmath103  denotes the small momentum scale with @xmath104 .",
    "analogously , adding a soft gluon to the 23 process yields @xmath105thus , the 33(24 ) collision rate is smaller than that of 23 by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "this argument can be generalized to other processes as well .",
    "thus , 22 and 23 are the only processes in the lo under this assumption .    the phase space of the 3-gluon state plays an important role in the collisional integral in eq .",
    "( [ eta2 ] ) for @xmath6 , which is controlled by the delta - functions for energy - momentum conservation .",
    "since we use the gunion - bertsch formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix - e ] ) , which is valid for soft gluon bremsstrahlung , it is consistent to apply the same condition for energy - momentum configuration of the 3-gluon state .",
    "this can be done by neglecting the recoil effect due to the soft gluon bremsstrahlung , i.e. neglecting the momentum of the soft gluon inside the delta - functions as is done in app .",
    "[ sec - sig23 gb ] .",
    "therefore , the phase space for the two near collinear gluons in 3-gluon state is 2-body - like .",
    "additionally the exact phase space is 3-body - like if the momentum of the soft gluon is kept and treated in equal footing as the other gluons in the delta - functions .",
    "we will see that using the 3-body - like or 2-body - like phase space makes a significant difference in the shear viscosity .",
    "in the leading - log ( ll ) approximation , one just needs to focus on the small @xmath79 contribution from the @xmath3 process . after performing the small @xmath79 expansion to eq .",
    "( [ eta2 ] ) , we obtain ( @xmath107 )    @xmath108    which agrees with that of @xcite very well . using the entropy density for non - interacting gluons , @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath110this will be used to check our numerical result later .",
    "in contrast , we take the boltzmann gas approximation ( @xmath111 ) used by xg , we get @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which would yield @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the error from taking the boltzmann gas approximation for the ll result of @xmath2 is @xmath11580% , where @xmath11570% comes from @xmath5  and @xmath11510% comes from @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that the quantum nature of gluons could play an important role on transport coefficients , even though they might not be important for thermodynamic quantities . in weak coupling regime",
    ", e.g. @xmath116 , the xg result in xu:2007ns gives @xmath117 while the ll result gives @xmath118 , which shows a factor 4 difference .",
    "but the difference from the ll result can be narrowed in israel - stewart theory @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , both @xmath3 and @xmath6 are needed to compute @xmath5 to the leading order ( @xmath7 ) . for the treatment of the 23 process",
    ", we consider three cases , ( a ) with the 3-body - like phase space for three gluons and with the lpm effect as the cutoff for the soft gluon ; ( b ) with the 3-body - like phase space and but with @xmath74 as the regulator for the soft gluon ; ( c ) with the 2-body - like phase space and with @xmath74 as the regulator for the soft gluon .    in case ( a )",
    ", the scale of the @xmath119 cut - off is set by the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect , as in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite gives an intuitive explanation of the lpm effect : for the bremsstrahlung gluon with transverse momentum @xmath120 , the mother gluon has a transverse momentum uncertainty @xmath121 and a size uncertainty @xmath122 .",
    "it takes the bremsstrahlung gluon the formation time @xmath123 to fly far enough from the mother gluon to be resolved as a radiation .",
    "but if the formation time is longer than the mean free path @xmath124 , then the radiation is incomplete and it would be resolved as @xmath3 instead of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the resolution scale is set by @xmath125 .",
    "this yields the condition @xmath126  which is confirmed through carefully derivations in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "the mean free path @xmath127 is given by the collision rate @xmath128 which sets the scale of the lpm effect is computed via the detailed balance rate .",
    "after integration , the boltzmann equation of eq.(boltzmann ) can be written as @xmath129where we have used @xmath130 . then the collision rate is the detailed balance rate in thermal equilibrium , @xmath131where @xmath132note that our definition of @xmath133  is the same as that of xg .",
    "the phase space for three gluons is 3-body - like in @xmath134 . and * * , * * as mentioned above , only near forward scattering ( around @xmath83 ) is included to avoid double counting ( see app .",

    "our @xmath136 and @xmath134 , together with the results for the boltzmann gas approximation ( @xmath111 , @xmath137 ) , are shown in fig .",
    "1 . our @xmath136 , which uses bose - einstein ( be ) statistics , is close to the boltzmann gas result .",
    "our @xmath134 , however , gets an enhancement for @xmath138 from the enhancement factor @xmath139 which is inversely proportional to the soft gluon s bremsstrahlung energy .",
    "this enhancement in @xmath133 makes the @xmath6 contribution to @xmath5 smaller in the be case than the boltzmann gas .",
    "the enhancement disappears at higher @xmath30 where @xmath140 , and hence the ir cut - off , becomes bigger .     and",

    "( [ eq : matrix - e ] ) with @xmath144 .",
    "thus , @xmath142 not only screens the intermediate states but also the external states .",
    "this is motivated by demanding the optical theorem to be valid in the medium , even though it need not be the case when the system exchanges particles from a thermal bath .",
    "thus , if the propagator in the loop is screened , then the bremsstrahlung gluon is also screened .",
