    "although it was introduced more than fifty years ago  @xcite , the tight - binding model named after anderson is still widely studied because it combines an elementary mathematical structure with non - trivial physical features .",
    "the simplicity of the definition notwithstanding , a complete analytical understanding of the model is quite difficult to obtain , even in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case which is the most amenable to analytical treatment .",
    "some fundamental properties of the 1d anderson model , however , have long been known . in particular",
    ", it was rigorously proved that all eigenstates are localised in the 1d anderson model  @xcite , unless the random potential exhibits specific spatial correlations ( see  @xcite for a comprehensive treatment of localisation in models with correlated disorder ) .    the localisation length is the key physical parameter which determines the spatial extension of the electronic states .",
    "a general formula for the localisation length in the 1d anderson model is still not known , but expressions for the limit cases of strong and weak disorder have been derived . the weak - disorder case , in particular , can be studied using a perturbative approach due to thouless  @xcite .",
    "thouless method gives a formula for the inverse localisation length which works very well for most energies inside the band of the disorder - free model .",
    "this perturbative formula , however , has its flaws : in fact , shortly after the publication of ref .",
    "@xcite , numerical calculations showed that thouless expression does not reproduce the correct value of the localisation length at the band centre , i.e. , for @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a short time later , kappus and wegner were able to ascribe this discrepancy to a resonance effect which leads to a breakdown of the standard perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "almost at the same time , and without any explicit connection to the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , an analytical expression of the localisation length for @xmath0 was derived in  @xcite .",
    "a thorough study of the `` anomaly '' at the band centre was eventually performed by derrida and gardner  @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that a `` naive '' perturbative approach was bound to fail not only at the band centre , but also for every other `` rational '' value of the energy , i.e. , for @xmath1 with @xmath2 a rational number .",
    "such an approach , in fact , gives an expansion of the localisation length which breaks down because some coefficients diverge . to avoid this pitfall , derrida and gardner devised a specific perturbative technique which allowed them to analyse the anomalous behaviour of the localisation length in the neighbourhood of the band centre .",
    "in particular , derrida and gardner showed that the discrepancy between the numerical value of the localisation length and the prediction of thouless formula aroused because the leading term in the correct expansion of the localisation length did not coincide with that obtained in thouless expansion .",
    "derrida and gardner also proved that a similar anomaly existed in the neighbourhood of @xmath3 .",
    "this anomaly , however , manifested itself only in the next - to - leading term of thouless expansion and was therefore undetectable within the second - order approximation . derrida and gardner surmised the existence of anomalies of a similar kind for all energies @xmath1 with @xmath2 a rational number .",
    "this conjecture was later confirmed by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , who focused their attention on the mathematical questions left open by derrida and gardner .",
    "subsequently , in ref .",
    "@xcite a quasi - degenerate perturbation theory was developed with the aim of obtaining a uniform asymptotic expansion , in powers of the strength of the disorder , of the probability distribution for the ratio of the wavefunction amplitudes at neighbouring sites . using this non - standard perturbative approach , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite re - obtained the results of derrida and gardner for the anomalies of the 1d anderson model at the band centre and the band edge .    in the last few years",
    "the band - centre anomaly of the 1d anderson model has been considered from a new point of view , i.e. , as a test case for the validity of the single - parameter scaling ( sps ) hypothesis ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) . according to the sps theory  @xcite , which is a cornerstone of our present understanding of anderson localisation ,",
    "the probability distribution of the conductance should depend only on a single free parameter",
    ". studies of the 1d anderson model , however , have shown that this condition does not hold when the energy lies close to the band centre  @xcite .",
    "this has led to a renewed interest for the anomalies of the 1d anderson model in the neighbourhood of the band centre  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a complete analysis of the localisation length in the neighbourhood of the band centre by means of the hamiltonian map approach .",
    "this formalism , introduced in  @xcite , has proved to be quite an effective tool for the study of 1d and quasi-1d disordered models ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the hamiltonian map approach is based on the mathematical correspondence between the 1d anderson model and a classical parametric oscillator .",
    "this analogy makes possible to associate quantum states of the anderson model to phase - space trajectories of the parametric oscillator . in this way",
    "the phenomenon of quantum localisation can be understood in dynamical terms as energetic instability of a stochastic oscillator  @xcite .",
    "our first goal , therefore , is to use the hamiltonian map approach to derive in a mathematically simple and physically transparent way the results which have been obtained by derrida and gardner and subsequent authors with non - standard and intricate perturbative techniques .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the transition from the anomalous behaviour of the model at the band centre to the normal regime away from @xmath0 .",
    "we focus our study on two physical magnitudes : the localisation length itself and the invariant distribution of the angle variable of the parametric oscillator ( whose dynamics we describe in terms of action - angle variables ) .",
    "we find that both magnitudes exhibit a gradual crossover from the anomalous expressions they have at the band centre to the regular forms which are found for higher values of the energy .",
    "the slow progression of the invariant distribution towards a flat form is important because it calls into question the validity of the single - parameter scaling hypothesis .",
    "in fact , this hypothesis rests on the so - called random phase approximation , which is equivalent to the assumption that the invariant distribution of the angle variable be uniform  @xcite . as for the localisation length ,",
    "our results confirm the blurred character of the transition which was recently pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , was based on purely numerical methods . here",

    "( [ inter ] ) works so well over the whole energy band is not surprising .",
    "in fact , the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) is the product of thouless formula and of a corrective factor .",
    "the latter is responsible for the anomalous behaviour of the localisation length in the neighbourhood of the band centre , but tends to unity for increasing values of @xmath136 . in this way thouless expression",
    "is recovered away from the band centre and the anomaly is taken into account by the corrective factor .",

    "in this work we have analysed the anomalous localisation of the eigenstates of the 1d anderson model for energies close to the band centre . using the hamiltonian map approach ,",
    "we have derived two main results : the general expression  ( [ invdis ] ) of the invariant distribution for the map  ( [ map ] ) and the corresponding formula  ( [ inter ] ) for the inverse localisation length .",
    "the first result shows that the random phase approximation , which is an essential ingredient of the single - parameter scaling theory , fails close to the band centre .",
    "the failure is not restricted to a negligible energy range because the convergence of the distribution  ( [ invdis ] ) to the uniform limit follows a power - law behaviour .",
    "the invariant distribution  ( [ invdis ] ) also allowed us to obtain the analytical expression  ( [ inter ] ) of the inverse localisation length .",
    "we have analytically proved that the general formula  ( [ inter ] ) describes the kappus - wegner anomaly around the band centre ; because it reduces to thouless formula when the energy moves away from the band centre , eq .",

    "this paper provides new insight for a critical investigation of the sps theory with the hamiltonian map formalism . in this work",
    "we have focused our attention to the 1d map  ( [ map ] ) for the angle variable and in this way we have been able to show that the random phase approximation , and hence the sps theory , fail in a finite energy interval around the band centre . however , an extension of our analysis to the complete action - angle map given by eqs .",
    "( [ map ] ) and  ( [ jmap ] ) is required in order to study the statistical properties of the conductance of a random segment .",
    "in fact , the conductance is related to the action variable , which is statistically correlated with the angle variable : hence a simultaneous study of both variables can not be avoided .",
