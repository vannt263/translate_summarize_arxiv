    "now _ fermi _ provides extremely broad energy coverage , @xmath7 , with high sensitivity for grbs , and is accumulating a wealth of new data which open a completely new window on the physics of grbs .",
    "the high - energy temporal and spectral data provided by _",
    "fermi _ can severely constrain the physical parameters of the grb emission region and the circumburst environment , which will lead to a deeper understanding of the central engine and the grb progenitors , and will also constrain models of high - energy cosmic ray acceleration ( for recent reviews , * ? ? ?",

    "the grb detected by _",
    "fermi _ on september 16 2008 ( grb 080916c ) shows several important new properties @xcite :    * the time - resolved spectra ( with resolution @xmath8  s ) are well fitted by an empirical broken - power - law function ( the so - called band function , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from 8  kev up to a photon with energy @xmath9  gev .",
    "* the @xmath1  mev emission is not detected together with the first @xmath3  mev pulse and the onset of the @xmath10  mev emission coincides with the rise of the second pulse ( @xmath2  s after the trigger ) . *",
    "most of the emission in the second pulse shifts towards later times as higher energies are considered . * the @xmath10  mev emission lasts at least 1400",
    "s , while photons with @xmath11  mev are not detected past 200  s. * the redshift @xmath12 @xcite and the fluence @xmath13 in the 10  kev - 10  gev range mean that this is the largest reported isotropic @xmath14-ray energy release , @xmath15  erg .",
    "some other bursts detected by the lat detector of _ fermi _ also display high - energy lags , similar to the properties ( ii ) and/or ( iii ) @xcite , and then they should be very important to understand the prompt emission mechanism of grbs .",
    "we will call the @xmath3  mev emission and the @xmath10  mev emission `` mev emission '' and `` high - energy emission '' , respectively .",
    "a simple physical picture for the property ( i ) is that the prompt emission consists of a single emission component , such as synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated in internal shocks of a relativistic jet . in this picture",
    ", the peak of the mev pulse could be attributed to the cessation of the emission production ( i.e. , the shock crossing of the shell ) and the subsequent emission could come from the high latitude regions of the shell ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the observed high - energy lag for the second pulse ( property ( iii ) ) requires that the electron energy spectrum should be harder systematically in the higher latitude region .",
    "this would imply that the particle acceleration process should definitely depend on the global parameters of the jet , e.g. , the angle - dependent relative lorentz factor of the colliding shells , but such a theory has not been formulated yet",
    ". the property ( ii ) could be just due to the fact that the two pulses originate in two internal shocks with different physical conditions for which the electron energy spectrum of the second internal shock is harder than that of the first one @xcite .",
    "another picture is that the prompt emission consists of the mev component and a delayed high - energy component .",
    "the latter component could be produced by hadronic effects ( i.e. , photo - pion process and proton synchrotron emission ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because the acceleration of protons or ions to high energies may be delayed behind the electron acceleration . however , it is not clear that hadronic effects can reproduce the smooth band spectrum ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a different two - component emission picture in which the delayed high - energy component is produced by leptonic process ( i.e. , electron inverse compton scattering ) .",
    "we focus on the effect that the ambient radiation up - scattered by the accelerated electrons in the jet can have a later peak than that of the synchrotron and synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) emission of the same electrons ( corresponding to the property ( iii ) ) @xcite .",
    "provided that the seed photons for the compton scattering come from the region behind the electron acceleration region of the jet ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) , the up - scattered high - energy photon field is highly anisotropic in the comoving frame of the jet , i.e. , the emissivity is much larger for the head - on collisions of the electrons and the seed photons . as a result",
    ", a stronger emission is observed from the higher latitude regions , and thus its flux peak lags behind the synchrotron and ssc emission .",
    "here we propose that the seed photons may be provided by the photospheric emission of an expanding cocoon .",
    "grb 080916c is a long grb , and it may originate from the collapse of a massive star .",
    "the relativistic jet produced in the central region penetrates the star and deposits most of its energy output into a thermal bubble , or cocoon , until it breaks out of the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cocoon can store an energy comparable or larger than the energy of the prompt emission of the jet , and thus it may make an observable signature outside the star @xcite .",
    "the cocoon escaping from the star will emit soft x - rays , and these can be up - scattered by the accelerated electrons in the jet into the high - energy range .",
    "the optical thinning of the expanding cocoon may be delayed behind the prompt emission of the jet , so that the onset of the high - energy emission is delayed behind the mev emission ( corresponding to the property ( ii ) ) .",
    "thus this model has the potential for explaining the two delay timescales ; the delayed onset of the high - energy photons ( property ( ii ) ) is due to the delayed emission of the cocoon , while the high - energy lag within the second pulse ( property ( iii ) ) is due to the anisotropic inverse compton scattering .",
    "we also show that the combination of the time - averaged spectra of the ssc and the up - scattered cocoon ( uc ) emission is roughly consistent with the observed smooth power - law spectrum ( property ( i ) ) ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "as we will explain below , the uc emission is short - lived and may not account for the whole high - energy emission , which lasts much longer than the mev emission ( property ( iv ) ) .",
    "it is natural that the high - energy emission in later times is related to the afterglow , i.e. , produced by the external shock which propagates in the circumburst medium .",
    "this possibility is studied by @xcite .",
    "they claim that even the onset phase of the high - energy emission is produced by the external shock . however , the rise of the flux of grb 080916c in the lat energy range ( @xmath16 ) is too steep for the external shock to reproduce it .",
    "thus at least the first part of the delayed high - energy component of this burst should be related to the prompt emission .    although some _",
    "fermi_-lat grbs show high - energy lags , the observational analysis of the delayed high - energy emission is fairly complete only for grb 080916c at the moment , and its data is quite extensive .",
    "thus we focus on this burst to examine whether the uc emission is viable for its properties in the high energy range in this paper .",
    "however , our modeling is generic , and we will show that the uc emission could be important for some other _ fermi_-lat grbs ( including short grbs ) .    this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : cocoon_dynamics ] , we derive the delay time of the onset of the cocoon photospheric emission behind the mev pulse of the jet , and calculate the flux of the cocoon emission . in ",
    "[ sec : emission_formalism ] , we constrain the physical conditions of the emitting region of the jet by assuming that the mev emission is due to the 1st - order ssc radiation , and show that the uc flux of the jet and its lag timescale are compatible with the observed gev emission . in   [ sec : fitting ] , we calculate the spectrum and lightcurve in a simple numerical manner and find appropriate values of the physical parameters of the cocoon and jet for reproducing the observed spectrum at @xmath17  mev and lightcurve of grb 080916c as the combination of the 1st - order ssc and uc emission .",
    "we discuss the emission at @xmath18  mev and the thermal emission of the jet in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the uc emission for other long and short grbs are discussed in   [ sec : other ] .",
    "we summarize our model and its implications in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the units of the flux density and flux , respectively , for comparison with fermi papers , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the conversion factors to usual units are useful : @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the dynamics of the cocoon after escaping from the star is studied in @xcite and @xcite . based on these studies ,",
    "we derive the delay time of the cocoon emission behind the prompt emission of the jet and the energy flux of the cocoon emission .",
    "the cocoon dynamics is dominated by its radiation energy while it is inside the star .",
    "we take the total energy and the total mass of the cocoon and the stellar radius as parameters , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "after the jet breaks out of the star , the cocoon expands with the sound speed , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the speed of light .",
    "the cocoon expands by its own thermal pressure in the comoving frame as expected in the standard fireball model @xcite .",
    "its expansion speed in the comoving frame suddenly becomes close to @xmath27 , and then the opening angle of the cocoon measured in the central engine frame is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the lorentz factor corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath31 . @xcite",
    "have performed detailed numerical simulations of the cocoon expansion outside the star , which show that the opening angle of the expanding cocoon is @xmath32 .",
    "this is consistent with the above analytical estimate .",

    "the cocoon material is dominated by the kinetic energy .",
    "the radiation stored in the cocoon is released when the opacity for the electron scattering becomes less than unity .",
    "the photosphere radius is given by @xmath38^{1/2 } \\simeq 2.1 \\times 10^{14}~{\\rm cm}~e_{c,52}^{1/2 }   \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_c}{50}\\right)^{-1/2 } , \\label{eq : photospheric_radius}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is thomson cross section .",
    "the cocoon may become optically thin later than the onset of the first mev pulse ( i.e. , the burst trigger time ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be the photon arrival time at the earth emitted at the stellar surface at the jet breakout .",
    "the first mev pulse produced within the jet at @xmath41 is observed at @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the bulk lorentz factor of the jet and @xmath44 is the source redshift .",
    "this timescale is comparable to the angular spreading timescale of the pulse , and we can take @xmath45  s for grb 080916c .",
    "the second mev pulse is observed @xmath46  s after the burst trigger , i.e. , at @xmath47  s. on the other hand , the cocoon photospheric emission is observed at @xmath48 where we have used @xmath12 .",
    "the cocoon photospheric emission may be observed from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the time during which the cocoon will be adiabatically cooled .",
    "if internal dissipation occurs in the jet at @xmath52 making the second mev pulse within the duration of the cocoon emission , the cocoon photons may be up - scattered to higher energies by the energetic electrons within the dissipation region of the jet , which may be observed along with the second mev pulse .",
    "therefore we require a condition @xmath53 .",
    "this condition puts a constraint to the physical parameters of the cocoon , @xmath54 we adopt the parameters @xmath55  erg and @xmath56 for the purposes of calculating the flux of the cocoon emission .",
    "the kinetic energy of the cocoon can be dissipated into radiation energy , e.g. , via internal shocks or magnetic reconnection during the expansion . since the cocoon material may initially have some inhomogeneities caused by the interaction with the jet and the stellar envelope , on scales @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a numerical factor",

    ".    it could be possible that the prompt mev emission of grb 080916c is mainly the photospheric emission of the jet @xcite . in this case",

    "this scenario requires different modeling from that in this paper .    alternatively , as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "it is possible that the jet is initially dominated by magnetic energy and the baryons in the jet are accelerated by converting the magnetic energy into kinetic energy , so that the jet is dominated by the baryon kinetic energy at the internal shock radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cocoon will be still produced by the shocked jet and shocked stellar matter , but a large fraction of the cocoon energy will be the magnetic energy . however , the magnetic fields could be tangled and dissipated through escaping from the jet into the cocoon and interacting with the shocked stellar matter and the ambient stellar envelope , so that the magnetic energy could become in equipartition to thermal ( radiation ) energy .",
    "the dynamics of such a cocoon after escaping from the star is similar to that in the non - magnetized jet case .",

    "it is an open question how bright the photospheric thermal emission from the magnetized jet can be .",
    "we have focused on the up - scattered cocoon emission for explaining the delayed high - energy emission of grb 080916c . since the delayed high - energy emission is observed for other bursts , it is useful to discuss whether the up - scattered cocoon emission may be important for other bursts .",

    "now we have @xmath270 so that the de - beaming effect of the relativistic motion of the cocoon shell for the seed photons of the uc emission is significant .",
    "however , this effect may be cancelled out by the beaming effect of the relativistic motion of the jet .",
    "the internal shock radius is @xmath271  cm , which is still much larger than the photospheric radius of the cocoon @xmath272  cm .",
    "then we have the angle between the direction of the photon beam and the expansion direction of the scattering point of the jet in the lab frame @xmath273 ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) and @xmath274 since @xmath275 , the de - beaming and beaming effects may compensate each other , so that the seed radiation can have the flux and spectrum similar to those for grb 080916c .",
    "therefore it is quite possible that the up - scattered cocoon emission contributes to typical long grbs and they account for the delayed high - energy emission .",
    "the condition @xmath276 means that @xmath277 ( since we focus on the region of @xmath278 ) and @xmath279 .",
    "then these bursts will not have the high - energy lags , i.e. , the property ( iii ) ( see equation [ eq : co_fnu ] ) .",
    "since the seed cocoon photons come from the front in the jet frame , the uc emission in the observer frame is stronger from the line of sight .    for bursts with smaller @xmath110",
    "so that @xmath280 , the delay timescale of the up - scattered cocoon emission behind the onset of the internal shock emission should be on the order of @xmath281  s , and thus in this case , the up - scattering effect may be important only if the duration of the prompt emission is longer than @xmath282  s.    some short grbs might originate from the collapses of the massive stars @xcite , and thus they could have the delayed uc emission . even if other short grbs are produced by the compact star mergers , it might be possible that the jet is accompanied by the delayed disc wind @xcite and that the emission from the disc wind is up - scattered by the electrons accelerated in the jet . for either progenitor models , the delayed high - energy emission associated with short grbs , if any , would provide an interesting tool to approach their origins .",
    "the _ fermi _ satellite provides an unparalleled broad energy coverage with good temporal resolution , and it is accumulating a steady stream of new data on the high - energy emission of grbs .",
    "grb 080916c , detected by _",

    "these include the new results on prompt emission ; ( i ) the time - resolved high - energy spectra are described by smooth power - laws up to a photon with energy @xmath9  gev , ( ii ) the high - energy emission is not detected with the first mev pulse ( i.e. , the first pulse in the @xmath283  mev range ) and begins to be detected along with the second mev pulse , ( iii ) the second pulse has the later peaks in the higher energy bands , and ( iv ) the high - energy emission lasts at least @xmath284  s , much longer than the duration of the mev emission .",
    "we have discussed a model in which the prompt emission spectrum consists of an mev component produced by the ssc emission of electrons accelerated in internal shocks in the jet and the high - energy component produced by up - scattering of the cocoon x - rays off the same electrons , and we have shown that this model can explain the above three observed properties ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) .",
    "the expanding cocoon may become optically thin some time later than the first internal shock of the jet ( equation [ eq : delta_t_c ] ) , so that the first mev pulse may not be associated with the up - scattered cocoon ( uc ) emission while the second mev pulse may be associated with it ( property ( ii ) , see ",
    "[ sec : cocoon_dynamics ] ) .",
    "the uc emission has an anisotropic energy distribution in the comoving frame of the jet so that the observed uc emission is stronger from the higher - latitude region of the shell .",

    "this has been shown by @xcite",
    ". however , the early portion of the high - energy emission should be the uc emission , because the external shock can not reproduce the observed steep rise of the flux .",
    "the observed flux and width of the second pulse of this burst indicate that the isotropic - equivalent luminosity of the jet @xmath285 and the angular spreading timescale of the pulse @xmath45  s. the absence of a @xmath100 absorption cutoff in the spectra leads to a jet bulk lorentz factor of @xmath286 @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we propose that another internal shock with the smaller luminosity @xmath292 and a fraction of electrons accelerated @xmath293 may produce the sub - mev emission ( see   [ sec : discussion1 ] and figure  [ fig : spectrumff ] ) .",
    "this interpretation is somewhat ad hoc but plausible , and we argue that it is compatible with the _ fermi _ observation .",
    "many numerical simulations suggest that the hydrodynamical jet will store a large fraction of thermal energy because of the interaction of the jet with the high - pressure cocoon @xcite .",
    "then the jet will emit a bright photospheric thermal radiation , which is not observed for grb 080916c @xcite .",
    "it could be possible that the prompt mev emission is mainly the photospheric emission of the jet ( instead of the 1st - order ssc radiation from the internal shocks ) , while the high - energy emission component is still due to the up - scattered cocoon emission from the internal shocks .",
    "alternatively , the jet of grb 080916c may be initially dominated by magnetic energy .",
    "it is not clear yet whether a large fraction of thermal energy will be stored in the magnetized jet while it propagates in a star .",
    "the jet could become dominated by baryon kinetic energy at large radius , and the cocoon dynamics could be similar to that in the non - magnetized jet case , so that our model in this paper would be entirely applicable ( see   [ sec : thermal_jet ] ) .",
    "grb 080916c is the only burst for which the observational data is extensive enough and the analysis is fairly complete at the moment , so that we have focused on this grb to discuss our model in detail . since our model involves much information from the observational data and many parameters , it is not easy to perform a more general study of the uc emission at this stage .",
    "however our model is generic , and we have briefly shown that it could apply to other _",
    "fermi_-lat grbs with typical parameters @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 for which the prompt emission in the soft @xmath14-ray range is produced by the 1st - order ssc radiation of electrons ( see   [ sec : other ] ) .",

    "the up - scattering effect could apply to short grbs as well .",
    "investigating the seed photons for the delayed high - energy emission of short grbs would be an interesting approach to their origins .",
    "a simple prediction of our model is that prompt emission spectra of at least some long grbs would have an excess above the band spectrum around @xmath199  kev due to the cocoon photospheric emission , and this excess should have a different temporal behavior from that of the mev emission .",
    "since the _ swift _ xrt detector can observe the grb prompt emission in the @xmath294  kev range at least 100  s after the triggers , the cocoon x - ray emission could in principle be observed if its onset times are @xmath295  s. in this case , we could examine the up - scattering effect of the cocoon emission if @xmath296 is smaller than the burst duration @xmath297 , while the cocoon emission may contribute to the early x - ray afterglow if @xmath298 @xcite . for long grbs with @xmath299  s",
    ", the up - scattering effect could be tested by future satellite , e.g. , _ exist _ , which is designed to have a soft x - ray detector and a good triggering capability .",
    "if our model is correct , we can constrain the parameter range for which hadronic effects are important on the high - energy emission of grbs , and we can also constrain the models of high - energy cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "also , the delay time of the onset of the high - energy emission , @xmath296 , is directly linked to the optical - thinning time of the expanding cocoon , which constrains the physical parameters of the progenitor star and the cocoon material of grbs . for grb 080916c , the stellar radius @xmath25 and the total energy @xmath23 and mass @xmath24 of the cocoon are constrained to be @xmath300 and @xmath301 ( see equations [ eq : co_constraint1 ] and [ eq : co_constraint3 ] ) . the cocoon energy and the cocoon mass come from the jet energy released within the star and the stellar mass swept by the jet , respectively .",
    "these constraints therefore provide potential tools for investigating the structure of the progenitor star just before the explosion , as well as the physical conditions of the jet propagating inside the stellar envelope through either analytical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ recently detected the most energetic gamma - ray burst so far , grb 080916c , and reported its detailed temporal properties in an extremely broad spectral range : ( i ) the time - resolved spectra are well described by broken power - law forms over the energy range of @xmath0  gev , ( ii ) the high - energy emission ( at @xmath1  mev ) is delayed by @xmath2  s with respect to the @xmath3  mev emission , and ( iii ) the emission onset times shift towards later times in higher energy bands . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this behavior of the high - energy emission can be explained by a model in which the prompt emission consists of two components : one is the emission component peaking at @xmath4  mev due to the synchrotron - self - compton radiation of electrons accelerated in the internal shock of the jet and the other is the component peaking at @xmath5  mev due to up - scattering of the photospheric x - ray emission of the expanding cocoon ( i.e. , the hot bubble produced by dissipation of the jet energy inside the progenitor star ) off the same electrons in the jet . based on this model </S>",
    "<S> , we derive some constraints on the radius of the progenitor star and the total energy and mass of the cocoon of this grb , which may provide information on the structure of the progenitor star and the physical conditions of the jet propagating in the star </S>",
    "<S> . the up - scattered cocoon emission could be important for other fermi grbs as well . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some predictions of this model , including a prompt bright optical emission and a soft x - ray excess . </S>"
