    "it has long been believed that the absolute magnitude of rr lyrae stars could be determined by their light curves and , to some still unknown extent , their metallicity .",
    "fourier decompositions , were introduced by simon & lee 1981 , as a means of qualitative description of light curves of pulsation variables in general , and they showed that amplitude ratios and phase differences provide a useful description of the hertzsprung progression for classical cepheids .",
    "in addition , simon & teays 1982 showed that the fourier decomposition parameters of 70 rr lyrae field stars are more sensitive discriminators of the bailey type ( ab or c ) than the traditionally employed period - amplitude diagram .",
    "several globular clusters ( e.g.  ) contain many rr lyrae stars , and since the variables in a globular cluster probably constitute a much more uniform sample than the field rr lyrae s , a considerably smaller scatter is expected in data from one cluster .",
    "petersen 1984 examined fourier decompositions of rr lyrae s in , and found that the scatter in the fourier parameters was larger than expected for a uniform sample .",
    "petersen 1984 concluded that the scatter was most likely due to the large metallicity distribution ( [ fe / h ] ranges from -2.3 to -0.5 ( butler 1978 ) , differences in mass of the horizontal branch stars , or differences in effective temperature .",
    "as smith 1995 pointed out ,  is so unusual in its range of chemical composition that it is questionable whether  is the key to the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation , too unusual to be a representative of the rr lyrae population , or just one more clue to an absolute magnitude - metallicity relation relationship which is more complicated than expected .",
    "see smith 1995 for a review on rr lyrae stars in general .",
    "according to two recent papers , kovcs & jurcsik 1996 ( kj ) and jurcsik & kovcs 1996 ( jk ) , the metallicity and absolute magnitude of rr lyrae ab stars can be described by a simple linear combination of the period and two fourier coefficients .",
    "kovcs & jurcsik 1997 added multi band observations to their earlier results to obtain an even smaller error , leading to an estimate of the relative distance moduli with an accuracy of @xmath0 0.03 mag .",
    "however , their sample did not include the unique globular cluster , which is included here .",
    "in addition to , this investigation includes the sculptor galaxy and the m5 cluster which were also included in jk and kj , such that results and errors can be compared directly .",
    "the observations of sculptor galaxy and  were made by the ogle team during 1992 and 1993 using the 1-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory ( see kaluzny 1995 and kaluzny 1997 ) .",
    "the ogle data is available via anonymous ftp from astro.princeton.edu , in the directories bp / sculptor and bp / omega_cen .",
    "all the m5 data were made by n.  reid during 1991 and 1992 using the the 60 inch telescope at palomar observatory ( see reid 1996 ) and is also available via anonymous ftp from astro.princeton.edu , in the directory bp / m5 .",
    "all observations used in this paper were done in johnson v.",
    "it is customary to decompose the light curve into its nth order fourier decomposition : @xmath1 where f is the phase given by @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the mean epoch and @xmath4 the period . defining @xmath5 , @xmath6 this can be written : @xmath7 ( see petersen 1986 for more details ) .",
    "since the high noise level in especially the ogle data makes it impossible to make a direct high order fourier fit , all the data was smoothed using polynomials . since the same mechanism is believed to be causing the variability in rr lyrae s , it would be reasonable that the same smoothing technique could be applied to all the data .",
    "this also has the advantage that the results are reproducible and can be compared to future observations .",
    "the data were first wrapped according to the period , divided into 9 equal parts which were then smoothed with a 7th order polynomial .",
    "the high order of the polynomial ensures that the curve is smooth in intervals with many data points , but follows the data points in less crowded intervals . to ensure continuity , the actual fitting",
    "was done over a three times larger interval .",
    "this combination of windowing and order of the polynomial gave the smallest @xmath8 for all stars , where @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of observations , @xmath11 is the ith observed magnitude , @xmath12 is the ith calculated magnitude , and @xmath13 is the noise .",
    "a high ( 8th ) order fourier series was then fitted to the smoothed light curve using singular value decomposition as described in in press et al .",
    "just as in kj , the fourier parameters refer to a sine decomposition and the phase is chosen as the closest value to 5.1 .",
    "increasing the order of the fourier series did not show any significant changes of the ( lower ) fourier coefficients .",
    "[ fit ] shows the observations and the fourier fit for one star from the sculptor galaxy .",
    "as can be seen , a better fit could be obtained with human aid , e.g.  using different order of the polynomials in each interval , changing the size of the intervals , etc .",
    "( which is what kj and jk did in their papers ) , but as mentioned above , a general smoothing technique has many advantages .",
    "no attempts were made to delete or disregard obvious bad data points on the individual light curves since this would be impossible in intervals with sparse data , and one might worry about introducing non random bias into the data . as a result , the scatter is expected to be fairly large ; however , given sufficient amounts of data the final result should be similar to kj s .",
    "jk s main conclusion is that the fourier parameter @xmath14 , defined as @xmath15 ( in general , @xmath16 ) , is the most important parameter when it comes determining the metallicity and kj found that the three parameters , the period , @xmath4 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 , completely determines both magnitude and metallicity .",
    "their formula for the absolute magnitude is : @xmath18 and the metallicity : @xmath19 ~=~ -5.038 ~-~ 5.394p ~+~ 1.345\\phi_{31 } \\label{metal}\\ ] ]    following kj , the observed magnitudes were fitted as a linear function of @xmath4 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 , again using singular value decomposition . to avoid zero point calculations and problems , the three clusters are treated separately , and since rr lyrae ab stars are both the most abundant in the sample and the only stars treated by jk and kj , these stars are the only ones included in the following .",
    "in addition , stars showing peculiar behavior are omitted .",
    "this includes stars showing blazhko behavior , stars with undetermined periods , a few stars with periods longer than 1 day , and stars several magnitudes fainter than the majority of the cluster .",
    "this means that 124 stars in the sculptor galaxy , 35 m5 stars , and 87 out of 97 rr lyrae ab stars were used .    to estimate how good the fit is",
    ", @xmath8 is calculated for each fit , where @xmath8 here is defined as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of stars , @xmath22 is the ith observed mean magnitude , @xmath23 is the ith calculated magnitude , and @xmath24 is the 1 sigma error on the observed mean magnitude .",
    "fitting for the three parameters gives @xmath25 for sculptor , @xmath26 for m5 , and @xmath27 for .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the fits which are given by @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30    as can be seen both from the figures and the @xmath8 s , the fits are poor , much poorer than what was found in kj . adding additional fourier coefficients to the fit gives only a marginal improvement .",
    "since some of the fourier fits show large @xmath8 s , these were omitted in an attempt to reduce the scatter .",
    "however , neither the scatter nor the fit changed significantly , implying that the main contribution to the scatter is coming from bad data points in intervals with sparse data ( assuming that it is possible to determine the magnitude as a function of @xmath4 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 in the first place ) .",
    "notice also that there is almost no dependency on @xmath14 , in contrast to kj s result , and that the dependency on @xmath17 is strongly influenced by the scatter .",
    "it should also be noted that while the fits for the sculptor galaxy and the m5 cluster are somewhat similar , the fit for  deviates significantly . the noise level in the two ogle data sets",
    "are much larger than the noise level in most of kj s data , but even in the case of m5 which has a much lower noise , the @xmath14 parameter seems to be negligible .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    different smoothing techniques ( i.e.  different windowing or orders of the fitted polynomials ) did not change the fitted parameters significantly ( deviations within 20% ) .",
    "since the noise level in the m5 data is low , the m5 data was recalculated without any smoothing .",
    "[ nosmoo ] shows the result , @xmath8 is 93 here , and the fit is given by : @xmath31 again , the dependence on the @xmath14 parameter is small .",
    "since the metallicity distribution in  is larger than in any other cluster , it would be interesting to do the same exercise for the metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , there is not enough data available in the literature , and the metallicity of the stars were instead calculated using the result from jk ( equation [ metal ] above ) and compared to the observed [ fe / h ] values from butler 1978 .",
    "notice that there are only 18 stars which are common for the two data sets , the result is shown in fig .  [ fig6 ] and , as can be seen , resembles a scatter plot .",
    "although the observations in this paper are noisy , the deviations from earlier results are troublesome in both the case of sculptor and m5 , where it was impossible to reproduce the low scatter found by kj , and in the case of   where none of the earlier fits seems to fit the observations .",
    "since kj also included sculptor and m5 in their analysis , their fits should show scatter similar to what was found above .",
    "it seems that the deviations for sculptor and m5 are mostly caused by the different smoothing techniques .",
    "however , any general smoothing using polynomials all give results similar to the above , and looking at the individual light curves , any smoothing ( general or done with human aid ) is a non trivial task due to the noisy and/or sparse data .",
    "in addition , the fits for both sculptor and  ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) shows evidence of extinction .    due to the unique metallicity distribution in this cluster",
    "can be regarded as either the best cluster to determine relations between absolute magnitude and metallicity or a non representative example of the rr lyrae population .",
    "this investigation seems to support the latter ; however , the concerns over the smoothing makes it impossible to make a conclusion .",
    "since noisy and sparse data is common place , a general smoothing technique would be desirable , and it seems that if we want to use rr lyrae s as standard candles , some form of general consensus on the smoothing has to be reached .",
    "it is by no means certain that the smoothing applied here is the best available , and it would not be surprising if the scatter is reduced by a different way of smoothing .",
    "however , based on the above , it seems unlikely that any general smoothing would reduce the scatter to the level found by kj .",
    "since the above results strongly suggest that the main part of the scatter is due to bad data points in intervals with sparse data , a better sampling of data would obviously improve the results considerably .",
    "i would like to thank the ogle team and n.  reid for obtaining the data and making it easily available via anonymous ftp .",
    "i would also like to thank j. jurcsik and b.  paczyski for discussions and helpful suggestions .",
