    "fig : confined_model ] , is realized by plates that repell the monomeric units and thereby restrict the polymer to a certain region in space .",
    "this gives rise to a surface model which is mainly characterized by its smoothness . in the simulations",
    ", we set up the united atom model with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath2 and @xmath3direction .",
    "in the @xmath4direction , we put two repelling plates at a distance chosen such that the resulting bulk density of the polymer system settles to the desired value .",
    "the plates interact with the polymers through the repelling ( @xmath5 ) part of the lennard ",

    "the other alternative , fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model ] , is the _ free polymer surface_. here the polymer bulk is held together solely by the overall attracting intermolecular van  der  waals interactions .",
    "individual chains may evaporate or condensate .",
    "the emerging surfaces are rougher than in the confined case .",
    "we suggest that the confined model applies to the interface between the polymer and a comparatively rigid material like a metal .",
    "such surfaces may also be formed on explosion pressed materials . on the other hand ,",
    "the free surface is capable to model the interface between the polymer and a ( dilute ) medium where any mutual interactions can be neglected ( in effect , it is the interface to a vacuum ) .",
    "all simulations to probe surface properties are perfomed at reduced temperatures of @xmath6 ( confined system ) or @xmath7 ( free system ) .",
    "these temperatures correspond to @xmath8 or @xmath9 kelvin which is above the melting temperature of real polyethylene .",
    "we stress that our simulations are not yet supposed to fully mimic real polyethylene ( it has been demonstrated , however , that much can be achieved by carefully tuning the parameters of united atom models  @xcite ) .",
    "the chain lengths are still too short and we treat chain ",
    "end monomers like mid  chain monomers .",
    "we also neglect the torsional potential ( the rotation about c  c axes is not restricted ) .",
    "the high temperature helps to ensure that in feasible simulation times , the chains travel several radii of gyration in order to guarantee correct thermodynamic properties . to check this , various mean square displacement measures as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : polymer_displacement ] . indication that the chain in its entirety has moved through the matrix comes from the relative displacements of the inner monomers relative to the center of mass motion ( @xmath10 ) and the outer monomers relative to the center of mass motion ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the cross  over points define charateristic time",
    " scales of the system .",
    "the presence of the cross  over points in fig .",

    ", the simulation follows 8200  monomers over 1.4  nanoseconds .",
    "if not otherwise indicated , the results given are for the chain length @xmath16 .",
    "in the case of the polymer system with confined surfaces , the plates are rapidly brought from infinity to a distance such that the monomer number density in the resulting box is @xmath17 .",
    "the shock results in a distribution of the density in the @xmath4direction ( system height ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confined_model_density_dist ] .",
    "these typical periodic changes of the density distribution close to the surface  @xcite are due to the external pressure produced by the plates , which leads to a local partial crystallization .",
    "the same behaviour has been found in simulations analyzing surface phenomena  @xcite and studied in the context of one long chain between two parallel plates  @xcite .",
    "the chains experience strong packing constraints as well as a loss in entropy that must show up also in the surface properties that can be observed during indentation .",
    "[ fig : confined_model_density_dist ] also probes the chain ",
    "end enrichment effect for confined surfaces .",
    "such an enrichment has been noticed by wang and binder  @xcite in a lattice model . shown with the density profile",
    "is the relative frequency of end",
    " monomers . this is computed by defining slices of height @xmath18 in the @xmath4-direction and dividing the number of chain ends by the total number of monomers within each slice .",
    "the resulting relative frequency is fairly independent of the slice height @xmath18 .",
    "we conclude from the figure that there is _ no _ appreciable chain ",
    "end enrichment at confined surfaces .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that there are no energetic or entropic reasons for the end ",
    "monomers to gather in the vicinity of the plates ( see the discussion for free surfaces below ) .",
    "the constraints imposed by the plates can favour a high positive virial contribution to the pressure . remember that for confined surfaces , the volume and therefore the mean density of the simulation system is prescribed . the high pressure in fig .",
    "[ fig : confined_model_pressure ] can be traced back to repelling intermolecular interactions caused by dense packing .",
    "to study the effects of a rougher and presumably more realistic surface , we set up a free system with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath2 and @xmath3direction and free boundary conditions in @xmath4direction .",
    "the polymer bulk is held together by the attractive part of the inter  molecular lennard ",
    "jones interaction . at the beginning , this system can be prepared like a confined one with two repelling plates in the @xmath4direction .",
    "this is mainly done to bring the polymer bulk initially into a regular shape . by previous experience",
    ", the density during the constrained phase is chosen close to the bulk density of a free system .",
    "after a time , the plates are removed and the system is free to relax into the surrounding vacuum . another possibility is to start with a periodic box completely filled with polymer .",
    "this system is run over a relaxation phase which is finished when the chains have diffused over at least two radii of gyration .",
    "after that the periodic boundary condition in the @xmath4direction is removed and the box is rendered three times as high as before .",
    "the polymer film is placed into the middle of the box and the simulation continues .",
    "the density profiles quickly approach their stationary shape and we made sure that their bulk or plateau values are independent from the initial density in the periodic box . especially for longer chains",
    "this gives a good criterion that the dynamics have approached the equilibrium stage .",
    "the bulk densities found for varying chain lengths are summerized in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_dide ] .",
    "the reason for the different bulk densities is the ratio of chain  end to mid  chain monomers . in our model ,",
    "the effective volume of chain ",
    "end monomers is higher than that of mid ",
    "chain monomers , since end ",
    "monomers with only one bond need more room than those with two bonds ( the lennard ",
    "jones range @xmath19 is the same for all monomers and longer than the bond length @xmath20 ) and also since the end ",
    "monomers have a higher mobility ( entropic effect ) . for different chain lengths",
    ", the bulk densities are interpolated by the formula @xmath21 \\ , .\\ ] ] since @xmath22 , there is a @xmath23 chain  end effect with a negative slope , in accordance with fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_dide ] . moreover ,",
    "note that in the period of time accessible to our simulations , no chains escape the polymer bulk .",
    "therefore the effective pressure in the vacuum phase is zero ( see also below , fig .  [",
    "fig : free_model_pressure ] ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_density_dist ] , the distribution of the monomer number density vs.  the height ( @xmath4 ) direction ( the direction normal to the surfaces ) is plotted . as opposed to confined surfaces ,",
    "no partial crystallization can be observed at free surfaces .",
    "also shown in this figure is the chain ",
    "end enrichment .",
    "again in contrast to confined surfaces , we observe the clear tendency for the chain  ends to escape from the bulk .",
    "end monomers require a greater static volume than mid  chain monomers . to reach close packing",
    ", they stick to the surface .",
    "this is also favoured by reasons of entropy , since the end ",
    "monomers possess a higher mobility ( they are only constrained by one chemical bond ) .",
    "these arguments , however , do not apply if the surface is pressed by repelling plates . in fig .  [",
    "fig : free_model_density_dist ] one clearly sees the enrichment effect , but an exact quantitative evaluation is out of reach , since if we increase the number of bins next to the surface , the bin width becomes too small to achieve good statistics .",
    "the presence of end ",
    "monomers of high mobility and the local brush  like structure caused by the chain ends will certainly affect the mechanics of surface disturbances like in an indentation process .    a complementary way to analyze chain ",
    "end enrichment is to look at the distribution of the normalized monomer index @xmath24 which is defined as @xmath25 mid  chain monomers get the normalized index @xmath26 , for end  monomers it is @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be the absolute frequency of the normalized index @xmath24 found at the surface and @xmath29 the total number of all monomers at the surface .",
    "these quantities can be determined by dividing the surface into patches , i.e.  dividing the whole film into columns . within each column",
    ", we look for the extremal monomers ( in a sense , these monomers then define the surface ) .",
    "the same approach is chosen below to sample the surface height function .",
    "the relative , chain length independent frequency of @xmath24 is then computed according to @xmath30 the result for chain lengths @xmath31 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_inde ] .",
    "if each monomer in the chain would appear with the same probability at the surface , the relative frequency would be @xmath27 , independent of the normalized index ( dashed line in the figure ) .",
    "we observe , however , a significant increase in frequency starting with a normalized index of around @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the shape of the curves is very similar for the different chain lengths .",
    "if the chain  ends migrate to the surface , one might suspect some correlation between the orientation of the surface and the chain end  to  end vectors .",
    "this is analyzed in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_correlation ] . for a given chain ,",
    "let @xmath33 denote the monomer positions .",
    "then @xmath34 is the end  to  end vector .",
    "as before , the surfaces are parallel to the @xmath35plane .",
    "we want to look at the normalized projections of the end  to  end vector normal and parallel to the surface , @xmath36 to place these projection coefficients into bins along the @xmath4direction for statistical analysis , we use the mid  point of the end  to  end vector , @xmath37 . fig .  [ fig : free_model_correlation ] shows that near the surface , the end  to  end vectors are on average parallel aligned to it .",
    "this indicates that both end ",
    "monomers of a chain are at the same surface . the alignment , however , does not extend into the plateau region of the density profile .",
    "this is an important result , since for thin films , orientational correlations could prevent the formation of a bulk zone at all .",
    "furthermore , the average length of the end  to  end vector in the simulations is 19  .",
    "compared to the film height of about 80  , there is no separation of scales .",
    "a related measure for orientation is the bond order parameter , @xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 with components @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 denotes an arbitrary bond vector connecting two monomers . in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_bondorder ] , the average is over chain ",
    "end bonds only .",
    "the mean values are computed from a number of statistically independent configurations in bins ( slices ) of finite width parallel to the film surfaces ( @xmath35plane ) .",
    "the bond order parameter is plotted vs.  the distance of the bins from the center of mass . in the bulk",
    ", we expect isotropic behaviour , yielding @xmath44 .",
    "we want to test , whether the chain ",
    "end bonds in the vicinity of the surface are oriented perpendicular to it , which means @xmath45 resulting in @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , from fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_bondorder ] we infer that this is the case . however , sufficient statistical data for the orientation of the end ",
    "bonds at the surface are difficult to obtain .",
    "the reason is that we sample in a region in space where the density is already very low .",
    "[ fig : free_model_pressure ] shows the pressure distribution . in effect",
    ", a free surface is the interface to a vacuum .",
    "this means that the external pressure imposed on the free polymer film is zero .",
    "kinetic and virial contributions should therefore compensate each other . in the figure ,",
    "the total pressure is slightly less than zero and the system will still contract somewhat during a final relaxation phase that has not been reached in the simulation .      in this section ,",
    "we are concerned with possible analytical fits for surface profiles and the systematic determination of surface location and width .",
    "a first idea is to start from the ( number or mass ) density profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_density_dist ] and to look for the points @xmath47 and @xmath48 where 10 and 90 percent of the bulk density are reached .",
    "the surface width is the distance between these two points , @xmath49 and as the surface base point we choose the the midpoint , @xmath50 . in what follows",
    ", this method will be called the `` 10/90rule '' .",
    "a second possibility is to fit the density profile with some suitably parameterized analytic function and to use these parameters to actually characterize the surface .",
    "this allows to compare profiles which have been fitted using the same family of functions .",
    "an appropriate family is based on the hyperbolic tangent , @xmath51 which is essentially the fermi function , since @xmath52 .",
    "the 10/90rule applied to a @xmath53fit yields the relations @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "such a fit is used in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_coor ] .",
    "another possibility is to use the error function ( the probability distribution for the gaussian normal probability density ) for the fit , @xmath56 the connection to the 10/90rule is given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "note that these functions also appear in the following paragraph when characterizing the surface by use of a `` height function '' , but then they enter in a purely statistical context .",
    "because of their steepness , surface characterization based solely on the flanks of the density profiles is problematic .",
    "the profiles must be determined by sampling monomers .",
    "if we put more bins onto the flanks , the bin width soon becomes too small for sufficient statistics .",
    "the following method offers a complementary approach .",
    "we look onto the upper surface from above and divide it  in the simplest case by use of a regular grid  into a number of patches . within each patch , ( which represents a column in the three  dimensional film )",
    "we identify the monomer with the highest @xmath4coordinate . in this way",
    "we obtain a mapping from the patches to a set of height values .",
    "we call this mapping the `` height function '' . for the given set of height values ,",
    "we determine mean value and standard deviation and compute from them the location and the width of the surface , respectively . to get the result for the lower surface , we have to pick the lowest monomer within each column .",
    "the method is related to the surface contour one obtains using a scanning force microscope .",
    "a resolution of 1 or 2 lennard ",
    "jones @xmath19 for the resolution ( distance between grid lines ) is found to be appropriate .",
    "when we plot the relative frequency of height values found , we obtain a probability density as in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_gaus ] which can be fitted with a gaussian normal density",
    ". then the corresponding distribution function is determined which represents some average surface profile .",
    "the relation between the height function profile and the monomer number density profile can be derived in the special case that the monomer density assumes its bulk value instantly below the surface . in this case , the finite slopes in the average density profiles stem only from the fact that the surface is rough .",
    "the surface is defined by the height function @xmath59 over a domain in the @xmath35plane with base area  @xmath60 . for",
    "the height coordinate  @xmath4 we obtain the probability density @xmath61 the associated distribution function is ( @xmath62 is the unit step function ) @xmath63 on the other hand , the mean density at height @xmath4 is computed by `` counting all columns filled with matter '' , @xmath64 under the condition mentioned in the beginning , one therefore finds @xmath65 of course , this is what one would have guessed knowing that the density reaches its constant bulk value instantly below a surface with zero local thickness . in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_width ] the thickness measures obtained from monomer density profiles and height function statistics are compared to each other for different polymer chain lengths .",
    "the fit @xmath66 was successful .",
    "we find that for longer chains the height function method , based on the statistics over outermost monomers , certainly overestimates the surface width .      in connection with amorphous materials ,",
    "the coordination number of a given particle is the number of all its partners involved in van  der  waals ( lennard  jones ) interactions . from the simulations , this number",
    "can simply be determined by counting all the monomers in the interaction range ( a sphere of radius @xmath67 lennard ",
    "jones @xmath19 ) of a given monomer ( monomers in the same chain do count except they take part in bond length , bond angle , or torsion interactions ) .",
    "again we assume homogeneity in the lateral ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) directions , associate with every coordination number the coordinates of its monomer , and set up the distribution of the average coordination number vs.  the height ( @xmath4 ) direction .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_coor ] . a theoretical estimate for the coordination number distribution @xmath68",
    "must be based on the monomer number density profile @xmath69 .",
    "geometric relations then yield the convolution type integral @xmath70 for the monomer density profile , @xmath71 , we use the ansatz @xmath72\\ ] ] with the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "this results in the computed curve for the coordination number in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_model_coor ] .",
    "the discrepancy in the plateau value derives from the fact that in the estimate we implicitly also count the neighbor monomers in the chain ( which should be neglected , see above ) .",
    "as expected , the flanks of the coordination number distribution are broader than the flanks of the density profile .",
    "this means that in the interaction picture , the surface region is further extended than according to the local density criterion .",
    "we have presented two methods to prepare amorphous polymer surfaces in molecular dynamics simulations with united atom models for the polymer chains . the ideas involved",
    "can easily be transfered to both more detailed models ( which , as one extreme , explicitly treat each atom in a monomer , or , like the ellipsoidal model  @xcite for bpa  pc , extend the united atom model by considering the geometric shape of a monomer ) and more coarse  grained polymer models .",
    "the use of classical molecular dynamics algorithms is not mandatory .",
    "carlo and hybrid monte ",
    "carlo techniques can be employed as well and the inclusion of stochastic langevin forces ( brownian motion ) is straightforward ( and , in fact , implemented in our simulation program ) .",
    "the present work is also a further step in extending the versatility of _ the materials explorer _ , a continuously growing , integrated software tool for the simulation , visualization , and quantitative analysis of engineering materials  @xcite .",
    "the work presented here will allow us to analyze our simulations on nano  mechanical surface indentation processes  @xcite in which we prepare a surface using one of the methods discussed above .",
    "after that , the impact of the indentation tool causes local disturbations and the deviation of the certain observables from their equilibrium values gives us information about the surface resistance and friction properties .",
    "related to the indentation processes are simulations on thin film bending  @xcite . a tool , which is more carefully driven as in the indentation experiment , causes non  local , large  scale deformations in the polymer film .",
    "again various observables ( density distribution , orientation of the chain molecules ) deviate from their equilibrium values and have to be analyzed .",
