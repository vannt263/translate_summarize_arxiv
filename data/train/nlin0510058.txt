    "directed transport has received a remarkable attention for a number of years now , since it has been recognized as a crucial issue in a number of physical and biological contexts ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a striking phenomenon in this context is _ ratchets _ behavior , where currents may flow in a counter intuitive direction .",
    "parrondo games ( see @xcite and references therein ) offer a remarkable and simple illustration of these subtle transport properties : a random combination of two losing games may result in a winning strategy . in this paper we present a deterministic analogue of parrondo games , in the form of a ( piecewise linear ) , periodic map on the real line , and study transport properties by means of periodic orbit expansions @xcite : in this simple setting they allow to perform analytic evaluations of the relevant quantities , while providing a highly effective perturbative technique to get accurate estimates in more general cases ( for instance by considering nonlinear mappings ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath0 we construct a deterministic realization of parrondo games in the form of a one - dimensional mapping on the real line , in section @xmath1 we briefly review how to study transport properties of deterministic systems by periodic orbits expansions , in section @xmath2 we apply such a theory to parrondo mappings and discuss some features of our findings , and in section @xmath3 we give our conclusions , and possible future developments of the present work .",
    "let us briefly recall the simplest implementation of parrondo games : we start from two simple games @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath4 is a simple coin tossing game with winning probability _ p _ and losing probability @xmath6 : each time the game is played the player toss the coin : if he / she wins then the capital ( an integer value , which we denote by @xmath7 ) is increased by one unit , otherwise it is decreased by the same amount",
    ". game @xmath5 is a little bit more complicated , as it requires two `` coins '' , selected upon inspection of the present value of the capital : if @xmath8 winning / losing probability is @xmath9/@xmath10 , while in the opposite case ( @xmath11 ) the winning / losing probability is @xmath12/@xmath13 : @xmath14 is a fixed integer .",
    "now suppose that at any integer time step @xmath15 ( starting from zero ) a game is played : @xmath16 with represent the instantaneous value of the capital .",
    "it turns out that fine tuning of the parameters leads to a paradoxical behavior : namely take @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , for a sufficiently small value of @xmath21 : both games are in this case slightly unfair : if the player keeps on playing @xmath4 or @xmath5 the capital will drop down linearly , while playing @xmath4 or @xmath5 in random order ( for instance with probability @xmath22 ) results in a winning strategy , where on the average the capital increases linearly with time ! the paradox can be explained by a markov chain analysis @xcite .",
    "we now map the problem to a dynamical setting : that is we want to introduce a map @xmath23 on the real line such that @xmath24 where `` transition probabilities '' are a reflection of the game rules .",
    "let s start from game @xmath4 : the dynamical realization is easily accomplished once we define @xmath23 on the unit interval as follows : f_p(x)=\\ {    ll x+1 & x[0,p ) + x - & x[p,1 )    .",
    "[ fpa ] and then extend ( [ fpa ] ) on the real line by translation symmetry f_p(x+n)=f_p(x)+nn [ tsa ] ( see fig.([areal ] ) ) .",
    "= 8.cm    the left branches of the map correspond to a winning event ( capital is increased by one unit , strictly speaking capital corresponds to the integer part of the dynamical variable here ) while right branches account for losing events . in the theory",
    "we will employ later on together with the map on the real line we also need to consider a corresponding torus map @xmath25 on the circle , that is simply defined as ( see fig .",
    "( [ atorus ] ) ) _ p()=f_p()_mod 1 [ fpatorus ]    = 6.cm    the construction of a dynamical mapping corresponding to successive playing at @xmath5 game is slightly more complicated , as the natural unit is not a single cell , but a group of three cells , due to the @xmath26 condition : once we take it into account we may define in this case @xmath27 fig .",
    "( [ breal ] ) and ( [ btorus ] ) show the corresponding map on the real line and on the ( @xmath26 torus ) , respectively .",
    "now we are interested in a random combination of the two games : we call @xmath28 the probability that at each step game @xmath4 is played ( @xmath29 will correspondingly be the probability of playing game @xmath5 ) : though a treatment involving composition of the individual games transfer operators is possible @xcite , the simplest way of constructing the relevant dynamical map is to consider combined rates of winning and losing , and then designing the corresponding map .",
    "we define q_1=p + ( 1- ) p_1 [ ranw1 ] and q_2=p + ( 1-)p_2 [ ranw2 ] these are the rates of winning if the capital is / is not equal to unity ( @xmath26 ) : the corresponding dynamical map is then very similar to ( [ fpb ] ) and precisely @xmath30    = 9.cm    the ( torus ) map is shown in fig .",
    "( [ rtorus ] ) : the labels @xmath31 indicated on top of the figure are symbols defining a partition of the unit interval according to the support of the different branches of the map ( cfr ( [ fpcomb ] ) ) , which we label by @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to remark that in each subinterval @xmath33 both the slope of the map and the capital gain @xmath34 are constant : in particular @xmath35 ( winning intervals ) and @xmath36 ( losing intervals ) . the slopes ( which account for orbit instability ) of the different branches are _",

    "@xcite : it automatically encompasses universality features , being invariant under topological conjugacies and , while allowing to get analytic results in the present context , it may be applied -as a genuine perturbative scheme- to possible generalizations ( for instance if we consider maps where piecewise linearity is lost ) .",

    "this easily yields @xmath37 and @xmath38 in terms of zeta functions @xcite ( notice that all cases dealt with in former papers however consider systems where symmetry yields @xmath56 ) @xmath57 for the diffusion constant we get @xmath58 where the first derivative is given by ( [ vzeta ] ) , while @xmath59",
    "in order to use formulas like ( [ vzeta],[dzeta ] ) for the deterministic version of parrondo games we have to provide an expression for the zeta function .",

    "( [ mgraph ] )    = 6.cm    as the weights we attach to cycles depend only on how many times different symbols appear in the cycle code , our problem is essentially topological and the zeta functions is a polynomial , which we can easily write down once we have the full list of non - intersecting loops of the markov graph of fig .",
