    "the fabrication of nanometer - size semiconductor structures by different techniques ( including lithography , etching , direct chemical synthesis , and self - assembly , to name a few ) has allowed a veritable explosion of activity in this area . @xcite it is now well - known that carrier confinement into dimensions of a few tens of nanometers provides strong blue shift of the photoluminescence features from that in the original bulk material , a clear consequence of quantum confinement in these _ quantum dots_. currently , researchers are investigating a variety of magnetocapacitance and optical properties of dots , @xcite including the role of inelastic light scattering and phonon confinement , @xcite as well as pauli blocking and other few- and many - particle effects in these systems .",
    "@xcite    in recent work , however , a new geometry of semiconductor quantum _ rings _ has been introduced in experiments of magnetocapacitance and infrared excitation for few - electrons . @xcite",
    "although _ metallic _ rings have been the subject of considerable attention for a number of years , @xcite this geometry had not been achieved in semiconductors for sizes such that the electrons would propagate coherently ( non - diffusively ) throughout the ring . however , the self - assembled quantum rings now achieved are so small ( with characteristic inner / outer radius of 20/100 nm and 2 - 3 nm in height ) , that they allow the study of a non  simply - connected geometry where carriers are coherent all throughout .",
    "it is clear that not only the single - particle states are interesting in this geometry ( specially their behavior under magnetic flux ) , but also the role of interactions between particles ( be it electrons or holes ) .",
    "et al_. have shown that multiple - electron states in this geometry experience phase coherent effects in the presence of magnetic fields , @xcite much as predicted by theory .",
    "@xcite the question of the observability of similar coherent effects for electrons _ and _ holes around the loop , in the presence of a magnetic field , is fascinating , and some theoretical works have already begun to explore this regime .",
    "@xcite although beautiful experiments of optical emission in charge - tunable quantum rings have been recently presented , @xcite they study the role of multiply - charged exciton complexes with no applied magnetic field .",
    "the multiply - connected geometry of the semiconductor quantum rings adds an interesting dimension to the strong coulomb effects in magnetic fields which have been explored in quantum confined systems .",
    "excitons in magnetic fields have been investigated in structures such as quantum wells , @xcite quantum wires , @xcite and quantum dots , @xcite as example of multi - carrier systems .",
    "for the ring geometry , one question that arises naturally is whether there is sensitivity of the exciton properties to an applied flux .",
    "this ` aharanov - bohm effect ' ( abe ) for an exciton is an interesting concept , since one would naturally associate the existence of the abe with a net charge ( as the coupling constant to the vector potential ) , and the net charge of this object is clearly zero .",
    "however , one could argue that the composite nature of the excitons would perhaps allow for a non - vanishing effect .",
    "in fact , for the case of particles constrained to move along a one - dimensional ring , rigorous derivations predict a non - zero abe for the exciton , which will show in its various energy states and the associated dipole oscillator strength , for small enough rings .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we present calculations of the excitation spectrum and oscillator strength of excitons in rings pierced by magnetic fields .",
    "we explore the role of different confinement potentials and calculate binding energies , exciton sizes and their dependence on magnetic fields , as well as oscillator strengths which would be measurable in photoluminescence experiments , for example .",
    "similar to the case of quantum dots , we find strong orbital effects from the magnetic field , which provides for effectively stronger confinement and accompanying diamagnetic level shifts , as well as splitting of some levels .",
    "these changes are found to be monotonic with field .",
    "part of our motivation in this study is to explore the question of how robust is the abe predicted in 1d rings , when one considers finite width and confinement potentials .",
    "the models we use are designed to mimic the situation in real semiconductor quantum rings achieved to date .",
    "much to our chagrin , we find no trace of the predicted abe for realistic values of the rings and fields in the problem .",
    "although this negative result would suggest that it is difficult that experiments would measure this effect , it is still open to see to what extent highly sensitive experiments might be able to yield a positive result .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model for the system and solution method . as a first approximation , the quantum ring structure",
    "is modeled by a parabolic confinement potential , in which the wavefunctions expressed in terms of the center of mass and relative coordinates are used as a basis set .",
    "this confinement potential has been experimentally confirmed by the recent experiments of lorke",
    "_ et al_. @xcite . in order to explore the role of different potentials",
    ", we also model the ring system with a hard - wall confinement , using wavefunctions expressed in terms of bessel functions for electron and hole as a basis set . in sec.iii",
    ", we discuss the main effects of the magnetic field effects on the exciton characteristics , including the binding energy , electron - hole separation , and the linear optical susceptibility . finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "the appendix contains an outline of the derivation of the coulomb matrix element with these basis functions .",
    "the analytical expressions presented there greatly simplify our calculations .",
    "our model is a two - dimensional exciton in a quantum ring and in a static magnetic field , simulating recent experimental quantum ring structures .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields oriented along the @xmath0 axis , perpendicular to the plane of the ring , induces the electron and hole to perform classical orbits along the circumference , which of course yield quantization of the angular momentum in that direction .",
    "@xcite the ring structures are well approximated by using parabolic potentials , giving soft confinement barriers , appropriate to samples produced by self - assembly .",
    "@xcite for narrow rings ( with steep confinement ) , however , the parabolic confinement and associated wavefunctions fail in a real system , as the increased confinement may push the levels into the anharmonic part of the potential , and even produce deconfinement of one carrier ( typically the electron ) , as found in some calculations in quantum dots .",
    "@xcite we also consider the case of hard - wall confinement and analyze the different results .",
    "as the quantum rings and excitonic states under consideration are much larger than the unit cell of the material , the effective - mass approximation is a suitable approach , and is given by @xmath1 , where the subscripts @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent electron and hole , and the last term is the electron - hole interaction .",
    "the expression for the hamiltonian of the electron in magnetic fields ( in a parabolic - band approximation ) is given by @xmath4 ^ 2 + v_e \\ , , \\label{c4eq1}\\ ] ] with a similar expression for the hamiltonian of the hole .",
    "here , @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) is the ring confinement potential for electron ( hole ) , and naturally @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for parabolic confinement potential across the width of the ring ,",
    "we use @xmath9 where the mean radius of the ring is @xmath10 , and the characteristic confinement energy is @xmath11 , giving a characteristic ring width @xmath12 for each particle . here , @xmath13 represents the different particles .",
    "we choose the fully symmetric gauge vector potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for electron and hole , respectively , following ref .. the coulomb interaction term between carriers is given by @xmath16 , screened by the background dielectric constant @xmath17 .      for the parabolic confinement potential",
    "is convenient to separate the problem into center of mass and relative coordinates , described as usual by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where the total and reduced masses are @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the total hamiltonian can then be re - expressed as @xmath22 , with individual terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 where @xmath26 depends on the mass asymmetry of the carriers , and we have set @xmath27 .",
    "we have also denoted the relative angular momentum in the @xmath0-direction as @xmath28 , and the effective confinement frequency as @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , resulting from the combined confinement of the potential and the magnetic field .",
    "the main purpose in the change of variables above is to use the solutions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 as a basis for the solution of the full hamiltonian .",
    "the center of mass basis is essentially a harmonic oscillator , with wavefunction @xmath33 centered about @xmath10 , @xmath34^{|l_{cm}| } l_n^{|l_{cm}| } \\left ( \\alpha^2(r - r_o)^2 \\right ) \\",
    ", , \\label{c4 - 1eq8 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 , and eigenvalues @xmath36 . here ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are quantum numbers of the radial and angular momentum part , respectively , for the center of mass coordinates , and @xmath39 is the associated laguerre polynomial .",
    "@xcite similarly , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the _ non_-interacting relative hamiltonian are given by wavefunction @xmath40 and energy @xmath41 , where @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "here , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are quantum numbers of the radial and angular momentum part , respectively , for the relative coordinates . with this harmonic basis set",
    ", matrix elements for the coulomb interaction , magnetic field dependent and mixing terms can be calculated analytically .",
    "@xcite these expressions are collected in the appendix .",
    "the total hamiltonian given above is then diagonalized numerically , leading to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "all the physical properties of the exciton in the ring can in principle be extracted from these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "here , we present the binding energy , electron - hole separation , and the linear optical susceptibility of the quantum ring . these quantities are readily accessible in optical experiments of photoluminescence ( pl ) and photoluminescence excitation ( ple ) . denoting the wavefunctions of the exciton as @xmath46 with coefficients @xmath47",
    "obtained from the diagonalization , one can write for example an expression for the electron - hole separation , @xmath48 similarly , the linear optical susceptibility is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the dipole matrix element between one electron - hole pair @xmath51 state and the vacuum state .",
    "these are proportional to the bulk interband matrix elements , @xmath52 , and can be written in terms of the envelope function as , @xcite @xmath53      given that the two - dimensional free exciton size ( effective bohr radius ) in inas is @xmath54 nm ( 6 nm for gaas ) , the quantum rings with widths larger than @xmath55 would tend to yield highly symmetric ( nearly circular ) ground states of the exciton , with the confinement potential being a small perturbation . for narrower quantum rings ,",
    "however , the symmetry of the exciton in the ring would be strongly affected , and become increasingly one - dimensional .",
    "this would be favorable for the appearance of the abe , as predicted by theory .",
    "@xcite to allow for this different case , and so as to test the possible bias of the numerical calculations in the parabolic potential , we have also implemented solutions of the problem in a hard - wall confinement potential basis .",
    "in that situation , the basis set for the exciton problem is given by products of the radial and angular parts of electron and hole , @xmath56 , where the individual wavefunctions are given by ( in the absence of magnetic field ) @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is an integer .",
    "the wavefunctions of the radial part must satisfy the hard - wall boundary conditions and vanish at both the inner ( @xmath60 ) and outer radius ( @xmath61 ) of the ring structure .",
    "as such , they are given by linear combinations of bessel functions , @xmath62 , for @xmath63 .",
    "here , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are normalized constants , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the @xmath59th - order bessel function of the first and second kind , respectively , with @xmath68 .",
    "the eigenvalue conditions are obtained from the secular equation @xmath69 , with a similar expression for the hole states .",
    "these expressions yield the basis for the electron - hole pair problem without coulomb interaction nor magnetic field , with eigenvalues @xmath70 .",
    "one can conveniently write the coulomb interaction potential matrix elements using this noninteracting pair basis via fourier transform integrals , as done in ref.(see appendix ) .",
    "similarly , can obtain the matrix elements of the hamiltonian which depend on magnetic fields , @xmath71 by using straightforward finite domain integrals of the basis set given above .",
    "the energies and eigenfunctions for the exciton are calculated by numerical diagonalization of the total hamiltonian _ with _",
    "magnetic fields obtained from the summation of all terms above . the wavefunctions are then represented as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are the coefficients calculated from the diagonalization . in turn",
    ", the mean electron - hole separation @xmath74 and the linear optical susceptibility can be calculated .",
    "we present here characteristic results of our calculations .",
    "as mentioned before , they are scalable for different materials , in terms of the bohr radius of the exciton and its relation to the size ( specially the width ) of the ring . the parameters employed here describe gaas , yielding an effective 2d bohr radius of 6 nm .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] compares the exciton binding energies obtained for parabolic confinement ( triangles ) with those for a hard - wall confinement ( diamonds ) , as function of the quantum ring width .",
    "notice that @xmath75 , where the first term is only the confinement ground state of the electron and hole , ignoring the coulomb interaction .",
    "for relatively narrow rings , the exciton binding energy for the parabolic confinement model is much larger than for the hard - wall confinement , as expected .",
    "this difference is a reflection of the relative strength of the kinetic energy to coulomb attraction increasing for the hard - wall case over the parabolic potential . in other words , even though we use nominally the same width ( @xmath76 for the parabolic potential and @xmath77 for the hard wall ) , the parabolic potential solutions are effectively less confined due to the finite amplitude ` leaking ' out of the ring .",
    "it is also interesting to emphasize that for smaller ring widths , the resulting wavefunctions are increasingly elongated _ along _ the ring , and this is more the case for the hard - wall confinement .",
    "in contrast , the exciton binding energy appears larger for the hard - wall confinement , for widths larger than @xmath78 , due to the known poor - convergence of the parabolic basis used ( e.g. , see a detailed discussion of this problem in ref .  ) . in the range of widths shown",
    ", both approaches have converged numerically to within a few percent everywhere , and at least an order of magnitude better for the lower two - thirds of the range ) .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] compares the ring results with those of a quantum dot ( with parabolic confinement @xcite ) with equal confinement _ area _",
    "( solid line ) . for wider ring systems",
    "all energies are basically equal , as the confinement potential is a weak perturbation to the coulomb interaction between carriers , as one would expect , be it ring or dot .",
    "on the other hand , the exciton binding energies in the narrower rings are larger than in the dot case with the same area , a reflection of the anisotropic confinement in the ring : for the narrow rings , the circular symmetry of the 2d free exciton ( either free or in the dot ) is strongly affected , and the exciton elongates along the ring , as described above .",
    "we should mention that the _ curvature _ of the ring has not much effect on the ground state or binding energies for the dimensions considered here , similar to the experimental values .    to indicate the role of the coulomb potential on the exciton characteristics , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the ground state energy of the electron - hole pair in the parabolic - confinement ring with ( triangles ) and without ( diamond ) coulomb interaction . for a smaller ring width , the coulomb contribution clearly increases , but not as fast as the confinement energy itself .",
    "the inset shows the electron - hole separation vs.  the ring width . for small width , the confinement energy is clearly dominant in determining the electron - hole separation , rather than the coulomb interaction term . for widths larger than @xmath79 nm , however , the electron - hole separation depends mostly on the coulomb interaction term .",
    "notice , however , that the rapid vanishing of @xmath74 for thin rings is somewhat of a biasing artifact produced by the basis functions we use in the parabolic ring .",
    "the necessary truncation of the basis appears to favor a circularly - symmetric exciton , clearly not the case in very thin rings .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the exciton binding energy and electron - hole separation versus the external magnetic field , for several ring widths , for a ring with middle radius @xmath80 nm .",
    "one can see that for larger values of the confinement energy ( i.e. , smaller widths ) , the effect of the magnetic fields is weaker , yielding the slowly changing curves at the top . however , for the larger widths , the dependence of the exciton binding energy on magnetic fields increases , resulting in the strong enhancement of the binding energies and decreasing exciton sizes with field .",
    "notice that for larger values of the field , the exciton binding energy changes little as function of the ring width , showing that the confinement provided by the magnetic field is dominant .",
    "this is to be expected , given that the magnetic length , @xmath81 overtakes the exciton radius at about 18 t.    for the radius of the ring in this figure , @xmath80 nm , one expects abe oscillations with a periodicity given by multiples of @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 gauss@xmath84@xmath85 is the flux quantum ) , or a period @xmath86 t. we find no appreciable evidence of abe oscillations in either the binding energy or the exciton effective size , @xmath74 .",
    "this result suggests that it is likely that abe exciton oscillations will not be seen in measurements of the ground state properties of the exciton .    since there is a prediction that the abe oscillations are to be found much more easily in the case of excited states , @xcite we have also looked for them in the linear optical susceptibility of a quantum ring .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a typical result for different values of the magnetic field .",
    "this curve represents all the possible transitions of this excitonic state which would be measurable via photoluminescence excitation measurements ( ple ; while the first peak gives the pl response ) . the higher peaks , starting from the one at lowest energy , correspond to electron - hole excitations involving the heavy - hole exciton ground state and various center - of - mass replicas ( i.e. , increasing excitations of the center of mass degree of freedom , without altering the ground state of the relative coordinate ) .",
    "on the other hand , the smaller amplitude peaks ( at shift @xmath87 , 330 mev for @xmath88 ) , correspond to _ internal _ excited states of the exciton ( its relative coordinate ) .",
    "these peaks are strongly upshifted with magnetic field , as the diamagnetic effect for each charge carrier pushes all relative energies upwards as well , and clearly these excited states shift even faster .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to the excitons in a quantum dot .",
    "@xcite we should also point out that in addition to the overall upward shift due to the diamagnetic effect , the @xmath89 traces show no discernible superimposed abe oscillations with magnetic field in any of the excited states .",
    "it would appear that the finite width of the system suppresses the abe predicted for the 1d ring .",
    "we should also mention that higher excited states are likely to exhibit the abe effect , as per earlier work .",
    "@xcite however , the parabolic or hard - wall confinement models used in this calculation lose validity , since non - parabolic corrections to the effective mass hamiltonian , as well as finite confinement potential effects would become more important .",
    "consequently , a quantitative estimate of the anticipated abe effects for high - lying states is less reliable , and more subject to specific values of parameters .",
    "a weaker confinement might also enhance abe , although experiments in that regime would be harder to identify and characterize uniquely .",
    "we have shown that magnetic field has strong effects on excitons in a quantum ring , for both parabolic and hard - wall confinement potentials . using direct matrix diagonalization techniques ,",
    "we have shown that at least for rings currently realizable , the excitons behave to a great extent as those in quantum dots of similar dimensions : there are strong diamagnetic shifts and restructuring of the overall excitation manifold , large shifts of internal excitations , and reduction of the effective exciton size .",
    "on the other hand , the predicted abe oscillations in the various physical characteristics ( including binding energy and oscillator strength of transitions ) of 1d excitons , are not found in this more realistic calculation . although we anticipated that the predicted abe effects would be much weaker ( due to the finite transverse size of the rings and ring radii larger than the exciton size ) , we have not been able to detect any oscillation ` remnant ' , in any of the features we analyzed .",
    "this negative result is due to either of two reasons , we surmise : one , the result of exponentially small abe amplitudes ( given the somewhat larger ring radii ) .",
    "@xcite more likely , perhaps , this is the result of destructive interference of relatively many transverse eigenstates ( mixed by the coulomb interaction ) , each with its own different phase and amplitude .",
    "notice that this is quite different for multiple - electron states in the ring , as predicted by theory , and recently seen in experiment.@xcite the difference in result from the case of only electrons in the ring to that of an exciton , indicates the predicted fragility of the effect , since in this system the net charge ( and then coupling to the magnetic vector potential ) is zero .",
    "in fact , the delicate nature of the abe suggests that smaller and _ narrower _ rings are needed in experiment , which may make for more one - dimensional  like excitons .",
    "following our discussion above , one could also expect abe oscillations to be more important for higher - excited states , even if more challenging in experiments .",
    "perhaps one could also think of a technique that explores _ differences _ , and therefore is able to couple only to a modulation of the hole population , for example , as a sensitive way to access these coherent abe oscillations for low - lying states .",
    "@xcite          the matrix elements of the mixing terms between the center of mass and relative coordinates , in the limit @xmath92 , are of the form @xmath93 \\left [ \\delta_{l , l^{\\prime}+1 } \\ , \\ ,   \\delta_{l_{cm},l_{cm } ^{\\prime}-1 } - \\delta_{l , l^{\\prime}-1 } \\ , \\ , \\delta_{l_{cm},l_{cm } ^{\\prime}+1 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\left . \\left",
