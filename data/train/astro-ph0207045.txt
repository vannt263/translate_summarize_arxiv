    "the detection of gravitational lensing of distant galaxies by foreground galaxies has been used in recent years to set constraints on the masses and sizes of the lensing galaxy halos .",
    "current studies suggest the presence of halos extending beyond 100kpc ( brainerd , blandford & smail 1996 ; griffiths et al .  1996 ; dellantonio & tyson 1996 ; fischer et al .  1999",
    "; mckay et al .  2001 ; wilson et al .  2001 ) . the same technique can also be applied to galaxies in the dense environments of massive x - ray clusters .",
    "analysis of galaxy - galaxy lensing in the cores of rich clusters implies a smaller spatial extent for the dark matter halos associated with morphologically - classified , early - type cluster members than that seen in the field ( natarajan et al .",
    "most recently , natarajan , kneib , & smail ( 2002 ) [ nks02 hereafter ] have found compelling evidence for the tidal truncation of dark matter sub - halos in clusters based on _ hubble space telescope _ imaging of lensing clusters at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the detailed mass distribution within lensing x - ray clusters , and in particular the fraction of the total cluster mass that is associated with individual galaxies  has important implications for the frequency and nature of galaxy interactions . as we show in this _",
    "letter _ , the characteristic halo sizes of cluster galaxies that survive tidal deformation and stripping in their dense environments offer tantalizing clues as to the nature of dark matter itself .",
    "while there is incontrovertible evidence for the existence of significant amounts of dark matter in the universe , its nature remains one of the challenging and unsolved problems in cosmology .",
    "following the original suggestion by furlanetto & loeb ( 2002 ) , we demonstrate here that constraints on the properties of the dark matter , whether it is collisionless or collisional ( fluid - like ) , can be derived based on the truncation radii of galaxy halos in clusters .",
    "if the dark matter is collisionless , then the sizes of galaxy halos in clusters are primarily shaped by the dynamical effects of tidal truncation and collisional stripping ( ghigna et al .",
    "the dominant process of tidal truncation acts on the short orbital time - scale due to the tidal field of the cluster as a whole ( taylor & babul 2001 ) , while collisional stripping results from binary interactions among individual galaxies ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the global tidal field of the cluster truncates the dark matter halo of each galaxy at a radius inside of which the mean mass density of the galaxy is roughly equal to the mean interior density of the cluster .",
    "however , if the dark matter is fluid - like then galaxy halos would be further stripped by ram pressure down to a radius which is significantly smaller than the tidal radius ( roughly by the ratio between the velocity dispersion inside the galaxy halo and the velocity of the galaxy through the cluster ; see furlanetto & loeb 2002 for further details ) . in this work ,",
    "we use the truncation radii of a sample of cluster galaxies , inferred observationally from the galaxy - galaxy lensing in the cluster a2218 ( nks02 ) , to decide whether the dark matter is collisionless or fluid - like .",
    "we model the background cluster as a superposition of a smooth large - scale potential ( @xmath1 in extent ) and small - scale clumps that are associated with bright early - type cluster galaxies ( see natarajan & kneib 1997 and natarajan et al .",
    "1998 , for more details ) . to quantify the lensing distortion induced by the global potential ,",
    "both the smooth component and individual galaxy - scale halos are modeled self - similarly using a surface density profile , @xmath2 , which is a linear superposition of two pseudo - isothermal elliptical components ( see the piemd models derived by kassiola & kovner 1993 ) , @xmath3 with a core radius @xmath4 and a truncation radius @xmath5 .",
    "the free parameters of this profile are chosen for both the smooth component and the clumps so as to obtain the appropriate mass distributions on the relevant scales .",
    "the projected radius @xmath6 is a function of the sky coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the ellipticity @xmath9 ( see  2.2 of natarajan & kneib 1997 ) .",
    "one of the attractive features of this model is that the total mass is finite ( @xmath10 ) . with the additional assumption that light traces mass , galaxy halos in clusters are characterized by the following scaling laws : @xmath11 these imply the following scaling for the ratio @xmath12 the total mass @xmath13",
    "then scales with the luminosity as @xmath14 and the mass - to - light ratio @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 for @xmath17 the model has constant @xmath15 for all galaxies ( although @xmath15 may be a function of radius inside each galaxy ) .",
    "if @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) then brighter galaxies have a larger ( smaller ) @xmath15 than fainter ones .",
    "the parameters that characterize both the global smooth component and the clumps are optimized using the observational data ( i.e. the positions , magnitudes , geometry of strong lensing features , and the smoothed shear field ) as constraints .",
    "we find that @xmath17 , is the favored value for the best - fit mass models and in fact , @xmath20 is ruled out at a very high confidence .",
    "our goal is to optimally partition the total cluster mass between a smooth component and the clumps based on the observational data .",
    "a maximum - likelihood method is used to obtain significance bounds on fiducial parameters that characterize a typical @xmath21 halo in the cluster .",
    "the likelihood function of the estimated probability distribution of the source ellipticities is maximized for a set of model parameters , given a functional form of the intrinsic ellipticity distribution measured for the faint background galaxies . for each faint galaxy @xmath22 with measured shape @xmath23",
    ", the intrinsic shape @xmath24 can be estimated in the weak regime by subtracting the lensing distortion induced by the smooth cluster and galaxy halos , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sum of the shear contribution at a given position @xmath22 from @xmath27 galaxies .",
    "this entire inversion procedure is performed within the lenstool utilities developed by kneib ( 1993 ) , which accurately take into account the non - linearities arising in the strong lensing regime . using a well - constrained ` strong lensing ' model for the inner - regions of the cluster along with the averaged shear field and assuming a known functional form for @xmath28 from the field",
    ", the likelihood for a guessed model is @xmath29 we compute @xmath30 by assigning the median redshift corresponding to the observed source magnitude for each arclet .",
    "the best fitting model parameters are then obtained by maximizing the log - likelihood function with respect to the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 . using a bootstrap method ,",
    "we have verified that while the convergence to the best - fit model is indeed driven by the brighter cluster galaxies , no single galaxy dominates in the procedure .",
    "the lens model for the mass distribution in the well - studied cluster a2218 at @xmath33 is arguably the best constrained case presently available ( kneib et al .",
    "1996 ) , to which we can apply our analysis .",
    "we use four sets of multiple images , which are all spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath34 , 1.03 , 2.52 and 5.60 , in conjunction with the background shear field , to obtain the best - fit parameters for a fiducial @xmath21 galaxy , @xmath35 kpc and @xmath36kms@xmath37 ( where the quoted error bars are at 5@xmath38 confidence ) . the mass distribution in a2218 is composed of two clumps centered around the two brightest cluster galaxies , and the profile inferred from lensing observations and x - ray data are consistent .",
    "although the mass distribution is bimodal , we note that the primary clump contributes @xmath39 of the mass .",
    "nevertheless , we take the presence of the second clump into account when calculating the center - of - mass of the cluster .",
    "below , we tabulate the model parameters for these two components in our best - fit mass model of a2218 .",

    "are located inside the core - radius and the rest lie interior to 300kpc , within a few core radii from the cluster center .",
    "there have been several dynamical studies of a2218 that yielded accurate measurements of galaxy velocities relative to the center of mass of the cluster ( danese , de zotti & di tullio 1980 ; le borgne et al .",

    "( 1992 ) , we find that 25 of the 40 early - type galaxies in our analysis have measured redshifts which allow us to estimate their velocity relative to the center - of - mass of the cluster . we have then computed the expected truncation radii for these galaxies in two limiting cases regarding the composition of their dark matter halos : ( i ) collisionless dark matter ; and ( ii ) fluid - like dark matter ( see furlanetto & loeb 2002 ) .    in our analysis",
    ", we have to additionally assume that the orbits of the cluster galaxies under consideration are representative of tidally stripped galaxies .",
    "ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have found that most of the strongly tidally - stripped halos move on nearly radial orbits ( since these orbits penetrate the high density core of the cluster ) and that radial orbits are overabundant by an order of magnitude relative to tangential orbits in the inner @xmath61kpc of the cluster .",
    "since we are using the projected location of cluster galaxies in conjunction with their orbital velocities at the present time , the nature of the orbits interior to 300kpc needs to be established in order to justify the assumption that these galaxies are indeed populating representative orbits for efficient tidal stripping . using the determined mass profile of the cluster , the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile and the number density profile of the galaxies , and assuming that cluster galaxies are good tracers of the potential well",

    "we obtain @xmath73 , which indicates that the majority of orbits are in fact radial and do plunge through the core of the cluster .",
    "such orbits are likely to facilitate tidal truncation as assumed in our analysis .",
    "for collisionless cold dark matter ( cdm ) the tidal truncation radius , @xmath74 , for the @xmath75-th galaxy whose pericenter lies at a radial position @xmath76 inside the cluster , is defined by the condition that the average density of the galaxy halo interior to the tidal radius , matches the mean density of the cluster interior to the galaxy location @xmath76 ( ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ; taylor & babul 2001 ) : @xmath77    for the case of fluid - like dark matter ( fdm ) , the halo truncation process is modified due to the additional process of ram - pressure stripping . in this case the truncation radius is set by the condition ( furlanetto & loeb 2002 ) , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the velocity component of the @xmath75-th galaxy relative to the cluster center - of - mass , @xmath80 is the density of that galaxy halo at its 3d truncation radius @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the internal velocity dispersion of that galaxy , both truncation radii are equivalent . ] . in our analysis , we have conservatively used only the measured component of the velocity of each galaxy ( relative to the cluster center ) along line - of - sight .",
    "since the full ( 3d ) galaxy velocity can only be larger than our adopted value , our constraint on the truncation radii of galaxies in the fdm case should be regarded as conservative upper limits .",
    "the considerations quoted above ignore any further truncation that is likely to be caused by thermal or turbulent heating ( gnedin & ostriker 2001 ) . using the above expressions",
    ", we derived the truncation radii for the 25 early - type galaxies in a2218 in the two limiting cases .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  2 .",
    "the observed distribution of truncation radii from the lensing data analysis ( solid triangles ) is compared to the radii expected in the collisionless limit ( solid squares ) and the fluid limit ( solid circles ) .",
    "we find that fdm models are ruled - out at a confidence greater than 5@xmath38 , while collisionless dark matter models are in excellent agreement with the observationally determined values .",
    "we find no correlation between the truncation radii and the orbital velocities for the cluster members in a2218 , as would be expected if ram pressure stripping had been a significant dynamical process in operation .",
    "the association of the retrieved model radius @xmath83 from the lensing analysis with the tidally truncated radius is strengthened through the following observed correlation . for a galaxy described by a piemd mass profile with velocity dispersion @xmath84 and whose orbital pericenter crosses the cluster core where the density is @xmath85 , the tidal truncation radius scales",
    "as @xmath86 deriving the best - fit values of @xmath85 from the strong lensing models and @xmath84 from the maximum - likelihood analysis , we find that the above simple scaling adequately reproduces the observed trends both for the truncation radius and the mass of a fiducial halo in the five _ hst _ clusters studied in nks02 ( ranging in redshift from @xmath870.58 ) .",
    "the trends seen in halo size @xmath88 with redshift from the lensing study of nks02 are also in good agreement with the theoretical expectation from numerical simulations ( ghigna et al .",

    "we have used gravitational lensing data to constrain the truncation radii of galactic dark matter halos in the cluster a2218 .",
    "figure  2 shows that the inferred truncation radii are consistent with the tidal radii expected for collisionless dark matter , but rule - out fluid - like dark matter for which ram pressure stripping is effective .",
    "the transition between the collisionless and collisional regimes is set by the ratio between the mean - free - path of dark matter particles , @xmath90 , and the radius , @xmath81 , of the galaxy halos under consideration .",
    "this ratio is given by , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the collisional cross - section per unit particle mass and @xmath93 is the surface mass density of a galaxy halo at its truncation radius .",
