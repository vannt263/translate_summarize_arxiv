    "differentially rotating neutron stars ( nss ) are subject to the so - called @xmath2 dynamical bar - mode instability for non - radial axial modes with azimuthal dependence @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , ... ) , when the instability parameter @xmath6 ( i.e. the ratio between the rotational kinetic energy @xmath7 and the gravitational binding energy @xmath8 ) exceeds a critical value .",
    "the bar - mode instability in differentially rotating magnetized nss has already been studied in the newtonian case by camarda et al .",
    "@xcite , suggesting that the effect of magnetic fields on the emergence of the instability is not likely to be very signicant unless when nss are born very highly magnetized .    in this work , we investigate if the presence of magnetic fields can affect the onset and development of this kind of instability in full general relativity , as well as the role played by the magnetic braking to possibly suppress the instability .",
    "our study is motivated by the potential implications that strong magnetic fields may have for astrophysical scenarios and for gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "in particular , during the last decade a general consensus has formed that long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) arise from the collapse of massive stars while short grbs , most likely , from neutron star mergers .",
    "a key ingredient for both these categories of astrophysical phenomena is the formation of magnetic structures that could power the high - speed particle jets associated with grbs @xcite .",
    "we choose to evolve different equilibrium relativistic stellar models that have already been studied in the non - magnetized case by baiotti et al .",
    "@xcite , so that their behavior against the bar - mode instability is already known and fully understood when no magnetic fields are present .",
    "the initial data for our simulations are computed as stationary equilibrium solutions of axisymmetric relativistic stars that are rapidly differentially rotating . in particular , we assume the non - uniform @xmath9-law angular velocity distribution @xmath10 \\ , , \\label{eq : velocityprofile}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the coordinate equatorial stellar radius , the coefficient @xmath12 is a measure of the degree of differential rotation , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 are metric components in spherical coordinates .    a seed poloidal magnetic field is added to these initial equilibrium models as a perturbation by introducing a purely toroidal vector potential @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is @xmath17 of the maximum initial pressure @xmath18 and @xmath19 is chosen in such a way so that it corresponds to the maximum of the initial magnetic field on the @xmath20 plane @xmath21 .",
    "the equilibrium models considered here have been calculated using a relativistic polytropic equation of state @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , in analogy with previous works in the literature .",
    "in particular , to better find out the changes to the bar - mode dynamics induced by the presence of a magnetic field , we focused our attention on a sequence of models having a fixed constant amount of differential rotation @xmath25 and a constant rest mass @xmath26 , which were already studied in the non - magnetized case in  @xcite .",
    "all the features of these models are then described in further detail in tab .",
    "i of @xcite and here we use the notation therein reported .",
    "for the present study , we selected the three models which were better discussed therein , namely models ` u3 ` , ` u11 ` and ` u13 ` , where ` u3 ` is the closest to the threshold for the onset of the bar - mode instability and ` u13 ` is almost the fastest rotating equilibrium model which can be obtained for this sequence at constant barionic mass ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : initialmodels ] , where the threshold is indicated with a red dotted line corresponding to @xmath27 ) .",
    "indeed , all the simulated initial models are represented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : initialmodels ] , where they are identified in terms of the initial values of the two parameters @xmath28 , defined as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the rotational kinetic energy , @xmath8 the gravitational binding energy and @xmath31 the total magnetic energy .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to a particular evolved stellar model by using the notation u@xmath32-@xmath33 , where @xmath32 is the initial model and @xmath33 denotes the maximum initial magnetic field strength ( ` u11 - 1.0e14 ` refers to a ` u11 ` model with a super - imposed purely poloidal magnetic field such that @xmath34 g ) .",
    "cm                 -0.5 cm",
    "the simulations reported here have been performed using the general - relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( grmhd ) code whiskymhd described in  @xcite and which is based on the cactus computational toolkit .",
    "the gravitational fields are evolved using the bssnok formulation with the same gauge conditions and parameters as in @xcite , while the grmhd equations are solved using a high - resolution shock - capturing scheme based on the piecewise parabolic ( ppm ) reconstruction and the harten - lax - van leer - einfeldt ( hlle ) approximate riemann solver .",
    "for all the simulations discussed here we have used a grid structure with four refinement levels , an outer boundary located at @xmath35 ( @xmath36 km ) and finest resolution of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 km ) . with this",
    "setting the outer boundary is far enough to have all the dynamics happening inside the computational domain , while the used resolution is already able to capture the dynamics of the magnetic field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for each unstable model ( ` u3 ` , ` u11 ` and ` u13 ` ) we have performed a number of simulations adding an initial purely poloidal magnetic field around the typical value of the field strengths expected for magnetars ( that is of the order of @xmath0 g ) and , indeed , in the range from @xmath39 g to @xmath40 g. much stronger initial magnetic fields are quite unlikely to be realistic , while weaker fields seems to have no effects at all on the dynamics of the bar - mode instability .",
    "the dynamics of the bar - mode instability ( @xmath41 mode ) is studied following the evolution of the distorsion parameter @xmath42 , which is defined in terms of the matter quadrupole moment in the @xmath43 directions through the quantities @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : initialmodels ] we show how the dynamics of @xmath46 is affected by different choices of the initial magnetic field strength : in unstable models , like model ` u11 - 1.0e14 ` , this parameter shows an exponential growth ( whose growth time , @xmath47 , can be easly measured ) .    in particular , regarding the bar - mode instability ,",
    "we draw the conclusion that there are three distinct behaviors corresponding to different seed magnetic fields .",
    "indeed , we observe no effects at all on the dynamics of the instability up to a certain magnetic field strength ( namely , @xmath48 g for model ` u3 ` , @xmath49 g for model ` u11 ` and @xmath50 g for model ` u13 ` ) , since both the growth time and the frequency of the m=2 matter mode do not vary within the accuracy they can be computed with ( see the left panels of fig .  [",
    "fig : rhosnapshots ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spacetime ] and the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : initialmodels ] ) . for higher field strengths",
    "we observe a gradual slowdown in the development of the instability , since the magnetic field lines are frozen into the fluid and the differential rotation has to drag them together with the matter implying that the instability growth time @xmath47 is higher for higher initial values of @xmath51 ( see the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : initialmodels ] ) .",
    "the models that are still matter - unstable , even when a magnetic field is present , are represented with squares in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : initialmodels ] showing the parameter space @xmath52 .",
    "going to much higher fields we reach a threshold value above which the instability is completely suppressed and the deformation no longer develops .",
    "this threshold on the magnetic field still depends on the initial model adopted , being higher than about @xmath53 for model ` u3 ` , @xmath54 for model ` u11 ` and @xmath55 for model ` u13 ` ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : initialmodels ] ) .",
    "-0.8 cm    besides , for very strong seed magnetic fields , we also observe changes on the density and angular velocity profiles of the stellar models , so in the end of the evolution we obtain a much more compact configuration that is nearly uniformly rotating and surrounded by a very low density envelope which is still differentially rotating ( see the right panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : rhosnapshots ] for model ` u11 ` ) .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that magnetic braking is transferring angular momentum from the core to the outer layers .",
    "models that are matter - stable are indicated by circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : initialmodels ] , while the ones that also exhibit the above - mentioned expansion of the outer layers due to the presence of the magnetic field are represented with triangles .",
    "taking a closer look at the magnetic field evolution for all seed magnetic fields , we observe that magnetic field lines wind due to differential rotation , and hence a development and linear growth of a toroidal component take place , with a consequent amplification of the total magnetic energy of about two orders of magnitude or even more ( see fig .  [ fig : emag ] ) .",
    "moreover , we observe a further exponential growth of both poloidal and toroidal components during the matter - unstable phase , whose nature still needs to be investigated .",
    "after having studied how the magnetic field affects the onset and development of the bar - mode instability , we turned to investigate whether there are effects on the dynamics of models which are known to be stable in the non - magnetized case . once again , this was achieved by superimposing a purely poloidal seed magnetic field allowing the magnetic field strength to take two values ; @xmath56 g and @xmath57 g.    regarding the distribution of matter we observe negligible effects when @xmath56 g. only for model ` s1 ` , which is very close to the threshold for the onset of the dynamical instability ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : initialmodels ] ) , we observe some minor changes .",
    "more specifically , the density profile turns from a toroidal initial configuration to a nearly standard one with its maximum quite close to the @xmath58-axis . in stable models with @xmath57 g ,",
    "instead , we observe the same behavior already described for highly magnetized models , namely the outer layers expand forming an envelope of much lower density around the initial stellar model .",
    "we have analyzed how the presence of magnetic fields can affect the development of the bar - mode @xmath59 instability in relativistic differentially rotating stellar models with a seed poloidal magnetic field in the range @xmath1 g. in order to do that we have performed 3d magneto - hydrodynamical simulations coupled to the einstein equations .",
    "for all the models studied we have found , as expected , a sudden formation and linear growth of a toroidal component of the magnetic field ( in a twisted configuration ) that rapidly overcomes the original poloidal one and an amplification of the total magnetic energy to up to almost three orders of magnitude .    for relativistic stellar models that are bar - mode unstable , we have observed almost no effects on the bar - mode dynamics due to magnetic fields of the order of @xmath0 g or below . for stronger magnetic fields",
    "the growth time of the instability increases and the bar deformation appears to partially stall . moreover , magnetic fields stronger than about @xmath0 g are able to completely suppress the instability and to change the density and angular velocity profiles of the stellar models , eventually leading to a final configuration where the star has almost uniform rotation and is surrounded by a very low density envelope .",
    "he same evolution is realized also for relativistic stellar models that are stable against bar - mode deformations for seed magnetic fields of the order of @xmath60 g. moreover , we note that the presence of magnetic fields does not alter the dynamics in stable models up to field strengths of the order of about @xmath0 g.    the overall conclusion is that only magnetic fields of the order of @xmath0 g or above seem to be able to suppress the purely hydrodynamical instability and so it is quite unlikely that in realistic astrophysical situations such a suppression due to the presence of magnetic fields might occur .",
    "indeed , the general picture discussed in  @xcite applies also in the non newtonian regime .",
    "this research has been possible thanks to the hpc resources of the infn `` theophys '' cluster and to the prace allocation ( 6th - call ) `` 3dmagroi '' on cineca s fermi supercomputer .",
