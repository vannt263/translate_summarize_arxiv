    "the resonance model of @xcite explains pairs of high frequency qpos observed in neutron star and black hole ( microquasar ) sources in galactic low mass x - ray binaries as being caused by a 3:2 non - linear resonance between two global modes of oscillations in accretion flow in strong gravity . in this report , we shortly review rather convincing observational arguments that support the resonance model :    1 .   _ the rational frequency ratio 3:2_.   for microquasars , the observed ratio @xmath2 of the upper and lower frequency is @xmath3 . for neutron star sources",
    "the ratio varies in time , but its statistical distribution peaks up , within a few percent , at the @xmath3 value .",
    "2 .   _ the inverse mass scaling_.   in compact sources , @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   _ the frequency - frequency correlation_.   the upper and lower frequencies of a particular neutron star source are linearly correlated along the _",
    "`` bursa line '' _ , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "observational points occupy a finite sector of the bursa line which typically crosses the reference line @xmath7 at the _ `` resonance point''_. 4 .   _ the slope - shift anticorrelation_.   for a sample of several neutron star sources , the coefficients @xmath8 of the bursa lines corresponding to individual sources in the sample are anticorrelated , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a small scatter .",
    "_ behavior of the rms amplitudes across the resonance point_. for the few sources examined so far , the difference between rms amplitudes of the lower and upper qpo changes sign at the resonance point .",
    "one should have in mind that except the inverse mass scaling _ the above properties are typical of a non - linear resonance in any system of two weakly coupled oscillatory modes .",
    "they give no direct clues on how to answer several fundamental questions connected to the specific physics of the oscillations of accretion disks : _    * _ which are the two modes in resonance ?",
    "_ an often discussed possibility is that they are the epicyclic modes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there are some difficulties with this interpretation .",
    "* _ what are the eigenfrequencies of the modes in question ?",
    "_ it was recently found that pressure and other non - geodesic effects have stronger influence on the frequencies of some modes than previously thought @xcite .",
    "if this question is answered , one may be able to precisely determine characteristics of strong gravity , in particular the black hole spin ( see section [ subsect : measuring ] ) .",
    "* _ how are the modes excited ? what is the energy source that feeds the resonance ?",
    "_ it was suggested that the excitation in the neutron star case could be by a direct influence of the neutron star spin ( e.g. due to a magnetic coupling ) @xcite , and in the black hole case by influence of the turbulence @xcite .",
    "understanding of this point may provide strong constrains on the magnitude and nature of turbulence in accretion disks .",
    "* _ how is the x - ray flux modulated by accretion disk oscillations ? _ it was suggested that in the case of neutron star sources modulation occurs at the boundary layer @xcite , and in the black hole sources it is due to gravitational lensing and doppler effect  at least partially ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mechanism of modulation must be related to connection between qpos and the `` spectral states '' @xcite .",

    "this agrees with black holes having lower qpo frequencies than neutron stars and is suggestive of a relativistic origin for khz qpos [ 1 ] .",
    "@xcite found that in microquasars the frequencies do indeed scale inversely with mass : @xmath13 the @xmath11 scaling could be used to estimate the black hole mass in agns and ulxs @xcite , if hf qpos were to be discovered in those sources ( see figures [ fig:3:2 ] , [ fig:1 m ] ) .",

    "thus , from the observed frequencies and from the estimated mass one can calculate the relevant spin of a central black hole @xcite .",
    "results of this procedure were summarized , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "several resonance models give the values of spin in the range @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , the 3:2 epicyclic parametric ( or internal ) resonance model supposed to be most natural in the einstein gravity @xcite implies microquasar black hole spin @xmath27 .",
    "however , the most recent results of the spin estimate for gro  165540 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claims the spin to be @xmath28 .",
    "it could be interesting that recently proposed 3:2 periastron precession resonance @xcite implies the spin of grs 1915 + 105 to be also @xmath29 .    on the other hand , _",
    "above mentioned resonance spin estimates are based on a resonance between epicyclic frequencies equal to those for exactly geodesic motion _ ( [ eq : epfrequencies ] ) .",
    "recently @xcite , it was found that pressure and other non - geodesic effects have stronger influence on the frequencies than previously thought . at the moment",
    ", it is difficult to give plausible estimate how this effects change the spin predictions as the theory is not developed enough , but work on this is in progress . a rough estimate , based on pseudo - newtonian calculations of @xcite and the assumption of the kerr case being qualitatively same , says that corrected values of spin required from 3:2 parametric resonance model will be rather lower then was supposed ( see fig . [",
    "fig:1 m ] , right panel ) .",
    "as was shortly reminded above , for the black holes @xmath30 and @xmath31 appear to be fairly fixed having the well defined ratio @xmath32 .",
    "contrary to this , @xmath30 , @xmath31 in neutron star sources vary by hundreds of hertz , along `` bursa lines '' @xmath33        the distribution of the @xmath2 frequency ratio in neutron star sources was shown by @xcite to cluster near the 3:2 value .",
    "this result was later criticised by @xcite who thought that the relevant quantity must be the distribution of a single frequency .",
    "we stress that this is a misunderstanding and these two distributions touch different problems . linear _",
    "correlation between the frequencies doesnt imply the ratio clustering _ because for this the location of data segment is important as well ( see figures [ fig : scox1a ] and [ fig : scox1b ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite confirmed the 3:2 clustering in the neutron star sources and shown also the very interesting clustering close to the related resonant frequency .    ) with a flat distribution in the lower frequency is placed approximately at the position of sco x-1 data in @xmath34-@xmath34 diagram .",
    "resulting histogram of ratio is peaked at the 3:2 value.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]        @xcite have shown that linear relations ( [ eq : bursaline ] ) for twelve neutron star sources are anticorrelated .",
    "below we shortly remind the connection between this anticorrelation and properties of weakly coupled nonlinear oscillators ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the frequencies of non - linear oscillations may be written in the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the eigenfrequencies of oscillator and @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the amplitudes of oscillations .",
    "if the two amplitudes , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are correlated , i.e. , if they are functions of a single parameter @xmath40 , one gets a linear relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , obtained from lowest order expansion in the parameter @xmath40 .",
    "the inferred coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 of linear relation ( [ eq : bursaline ] ) will vary from source to source , but if the eigenfrequencies of oscilations ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) are universal for the sources ( being fixed by the common space - time metric and mass ) , then these linear relations themselves will satisfy @xmath43 therefore , _ the slope @xmath41 and the shift @xmath42 are anticorrelated_. if the eigenfrequencies of oscillators slightly differ of factor @xmath44 ( e.g. , due to the difference of the mass and connected @xmath11 frequency scaling ) but the ratio of eigenfrequencies is fixed , this anticorrelation reads @xmath45 thus , for given type of resonance , the individual pairs @xmath46 should locate on lines inside a triangle in the @xmath41-@xmath42 plane with a quite well determined vertex at @xmath47 $ ] , and with the size of its base proportional to the scatter in @xmath48 . in particular for the 3:2 resonance , the vertex should be @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "figure [ fig : anti ] suggests that this is indeed the case .    in principle , for the _ 3:2 parametric epicyclic resonance model _ the eigenfrequencies of oscillations can be directly identified with the epicyclic frequencies of keplerian motion at the location of this 3:2 resonance .",
    "this implies that the _ generic _ neutron star mass connected to the straight line in fig .",

    "( [ eq : anticorr4 ] ) is most likely from the interval @xmath51 . under the assumption that difference in the eigenfrequencies",
    "is caused by different neutron star mass , the mass should differ of factor @xmath521.5 .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]      quite recently , trk discovered the strong change in character of the observed qpo amplitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the rms amplitude of the lower qpo and the rms amplitude of the relevant upper qpo , i.e. , the quantity @xmath53 is rather well correlated with frequency and changes its sign across the 3:2 resonance line which is illustrated in figures  [ fig:16081728 ] and [ fig:1636 ] .",
    "it was noticed by hork that such phenomenon resembles general behavior of mechanical systems crossing an internal resonance ( @xcite ) .",
    "as some frequencies approach a rational ratio the modes involved in the resonance start to exchange energy .",
    "the slow motion through the resonance perturbs the strict balance between both directions of energy exchange and finally causes increase of one amplitude at the expense of the other one .",
