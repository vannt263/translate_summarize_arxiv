    "quarkonia suppression was predicted by matsui and satz @xcite as a sign of quark - gluon plasma production in heavy - ion collisions . it has been experimentally observed but some aspects are still poorly understood , e.g. the unexpected  suppression \" of the @xmath1 suppression at low @xmath2 as the collision energy increases .",
    "this paper aims to describe the @xmath1 suppression from a dynamical point of view , as an alternative scheme to stationary sequential suppression , recombination ...    instead of studying the bound states survival in a stationary medium ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath3 pair ( @xmath4 being a heavy quark ) dynamics in a non - stationary qgp until the freeze out .",
    "the qgp is considered here as a color screening medium at thermal equilibrium with a homogeneous time dependent temperature .",
    "the elliptic flow observations at rhic and lhc suggest that the quarkonia thermalise partially with the medium .",
    "our @xmath3 pair will therefore undergo a color screened , temperature dependent , self potential and some langevin forces coming from its direct interaction with the thermal medium .",
    "we expect the thermalisation effect to be the answer to the observed suppression of the suppression as it should tend to hold the @xmath3 together",
    ".    ideally a full quantum formalism would be desirable , however the thermalisation of a quantum state being still an unsolved problem , we base this study on a semi - classical formalism inspired by young and shuryak work @xcite . as a test of reliability , a comparison to pure quantum results",
    "is carried out in the case without langevin dynamics .",
    "in usual quantum mechanics , the @xmath3 pair probabilistic information is described by a wavefunction @xmath5 , which evolution is given by the schrdinger equation .",
    "equivalently , the @xmath3 pair can be described as a phase space distribution called the wigner distribution @xmath6 , derived from the wigner transformation of the wavefunction @xcite . its evolution",
    "is then given by the wigner - moyal equation , which classical limit ( equivalent to the liouville equation ) is used within the semi - classical frame .",
    "to evaluate the probability ( or `` @xmath1 weight '' ) of the @xmath3 pair to bind as a @xmath1 state , one projects its evolved wigner distribution onto the @xmath1 wigner distribution , computed from the vacuum potential .",
    "this semi - classical approach allows us the access to numerical simulations through the practical use of the test particles method .",
    "the binding @xmath3 potential in the qgp is a temperature dependent potential that takes into account the presence of color charges in their vicinity .",
    "we choose to lead this study with the potential @xmath7 , evaluated by kaczmarek et al .",

    "it corresponds to the color singlet internal energy , i.e. assuming no energy exchange between the pair and the medium ( a redundancy with the stochastic forces is therefore avoided ) .    in the common heavy - ion collisions",
    "simplified scenario , the @xmath3 pair is first produced within a short lapse of time ( @xmath8 fm / c ) , promptly followed by a warm cooling qgp phase ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 fm / c ) in which the @xmath3 pair evolves .",
    "finally , a cooler hadronisation phase ( @xmath11 ) follows until the freeze out .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath12 is taken equal to 165 mev .",
    "we choose the space - time temperature distribution derived by @xcite through the use of a hydrodynamic evolution of an initial thermalised state @xcite .",
    "to simplify , the spatial distribution is reduced to the temperature at the centre of the fireball ( see figure [ fig : potandtempevolution ] ) and the @xmath3 pair is assumed to be produced at @xmath13 fm / c , i.e. from which the qgp is at thermal equilibrium .",

    "the initial radial wave - function is a gaussian wavepacket with a 0.165 fm r.m.s . for the @xmath0 pair .",
    "the latter can be estimated by applying the uncertainty principle to the intermediate quark of the @xmath3 production feynman diagrams ( lo u or t channel ) : @xmath20 fm .      in order to check the limits of the semi - classical approximation ,",
    "the results are here compared to pure quantum results ( from the time - dependent schrdinger equation ) . if v=0 , the @xmath1 weights are identical as expected from the erhenfest theorem . however , in the case of our screened potential , the semi classical results exhibit strong discrepancies ( fig .",

    "the observation of the test particle paths in phase space shows that the lump is due to their loss of momentum while climbing the potential barrier ( making them enter the  @xmath1 zone \" ) .",
    "consequently , if the langevin dynamics does not lead the evolution , the validity of the semi - classical `` thermalised '' results ( section [ sctherm ] and @xcite ) is questionable . as a positive point , one observes for both formalism oscillations between eigenstates due to high asymptotic values of the potential when @xmath22 fm / c .",

    "a way to take into account the thermalisation of the @xmath3 pair in this dynamical model is to consider the random interactions between the @xmath3 pair and the qgp constituents . by analogy with the fokker - planck equation of motion in momentum space ( equivalent to langevin forces ) , we introduce additional stochastic terms in the wigner moyal equation .    in practice ( particle test method ) ,",

    "the weight slow decrease , for @xmath34 fm / c , comes from the spatial diffusion of the @xmath0 pair distribution due to the stochastic force term . from @xmath35 fm / c",
    ", the light weight variations follow the important variations of the u potential : high asymptotic values lead to a narrowing of the spatial distribution and low asymptotic values to its spatial diffusion .",

    "( see section [ idist ] ) variation of @xmath37 fm / c ( @xmath38 ) leads to a maximum normed @xmath1 weight deviation of 0.03 ( @xmath39 ) at the freeze out .",

    "of course the comparison to data may not be taken too seriously as we have not considered cold nuclear matter effects , feed downs from other quarkonia ... including them would mostly have a positive effect as our results ( especially at rhic ) underestimate the data at high @xmath2 , where color - screening effects are expected to be relatively more important @xcite .",
