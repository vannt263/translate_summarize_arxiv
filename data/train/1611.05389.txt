    "we have known for decades that stellar and ism components of galaxies , including our own milky way , account for only a small fraction of their baryons , compared to the amount expected in their halos from the universal baryon fraction @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "as interesting as the missing baryons problem is the missing metals problem ; nearby galaxies are also short of metals expected from the star formation history of the universe @xcite .",
    "perhaps a solution to both of these problems lies in the highly ionized warm - hot gas in the circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) of galaxies .",
    "recent theoretical models suggest that the cgm of galaxies contains a large reservoir of warm - hot gas accounting for the majority of galactic baryons @xcite and according to @xcite , the cgm could account for 40% of metals produced by star forming galaxies .",
    "the distribution , spacial extent , and mass of this warm - hot gas provide important constraints to models of galaxy formation and the accretion and feedback mechanisms .",
    "although theoretical models predict the existence of the warm - hot gas in the cgm , detecting and characterizing the diffuse cgm has been difficult .",
    "because of our special vantage point , our own milky way provides a unique opportunity to probe the cgm of a spiral galaxy .",
    "the warm - hot cgm gas can be effectively probed by highly ionized metals ; the dominant transitions from such ions lie in the soft x - ray band . in literature",
    "there are multiple reports on detection of redshift zero absorption lines due to and @xcite .",
    "but it is difficult to measure the extent , density , and mass of this warm hot gas because of the inherent difficulty in using absorption line studies alone .",
    "while the absorption line column density is a product of density and pathlength , emission measure is a product of density square and pathlength , so a combination of absorption and emission studies are required to break the degeneracy and so fully characterize the warm - hot cgm .",
    "indeed various broad - band x - ray observations have revealed an extensive diffuse soft ( @xmath13 1 kev ) x - ray background ( sxrb ) .",
    "shadow observations show that there is a significant contribution from the galactic halo to sxrb @xcite .    in ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper - i ) , combining observations of and absorption lines and and measurements of the galactic halo emission measure , we found that there is a huge reservoir of ionized gas around the milky way , with a mass of over 60 billion solar masses and a radius of over 100 kpc .",
    "thus there appears to be more baryonic mass in the warm - hot cgm than in the entire disk of the galaxy and as much mass in metals as in all the stars in the disk . in paper - i",
    "we compared absorption and emission values average over the whole sky .",
    "however , shadow observations and other studies of soft x - ray diffuse background show that the emission measure of the galactic halo varies by an order of magnitude in different sight - lines @xcite .",
    "therefore it is crucial to determine the emission measure of emitting gas near absorption sight - lines to understand the differences in physical properties of the cgm across the sky .    in ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper - ii ) we compared absorption and emission along two sightlines : toward mrk421 and pks2155 - 304 . in these two sightlines ,",
    "the observed column densities are similar , but observed emission measures are different , so their densities and/or pathlengths must be different .",
    "indeed we found that toward mrk421 and pks2155 - 304 the densities are @xmath14@xmath9 and @xmath15@xmath9 and pathlengths are @xmath16kpc and @xmath17kpc respectively . while the errors on the derived parameters are large , this provides a suggestive evidence that the warm - hot gas in the cgm of the milky way is not distributed uniformly .",
    "here we expand on our previous work and constrain the physical properties ( temperature , path - length , density , and mass ) of cgm in the sightline toward 509 . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we present a detailed analysis of our and ( pi : gupta ) new observations of a blank sky field near 509 .",
    "we also present detailed reanalysis of the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) 2012 observation of 509 .",
    "@xcite have analyzed and modeled the intrinsic absorbers of 509 .",
    "here we focus on the redshift zero absorption lines . in section 5",
    "we present results with a uniform density model as well as a @xmath6model .",
    "the discussion is presented in  7 .",
    "a blank x - ray sky field ( _ off - field2 _ ) adjacent to 509 was observed by and .",
    "the observation ids , dates , pointing directions and exposure times are summarized in table 1 .",
    "figure  1 shows the rosat all sky survey ( rass ; 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) image in the vicinity of 509 , along with the and pointing of _ off - field2_. 509 was observed with low energy transmission grating ( letg ) and high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) in december 2009 and september 2012 respectively .",
    "we presented our results on the @xmath18 and absorption lines from the letg observation in paper - i . in the following we report on the data reduction of and observations of _ off - field2 _ and hetg observation of mrk  509 .",
    "_ off - field2 _ was observed by xmm - newton for 60 ks on november 2013 .",
    "the observation was performed with the `` thin '' filter using the full - frame ( ff ) mode for all the epic ( european photon imaging camera ) cameras . in this work we used data from the epic - pn and epic - mos detectors .",
    "we reduced the data using the xmm - newton extended source analysis software ( xmm - esas ; snowden & kuntz 2013 ) as distributed with version 13.5.0 of the science analysis system ( sas ) .",
    "we first used the standard sas _",
    "emchain _ and _ epchain _ scripts to produce calibrated events lists from mos and pn cameras respectively , and then run the xmm - esas _ mos - filter _ and _ pn - filter _ scripts . *",
    "these scripts call the sas task _ espfilt _ for light - curve cleaning .",
    "it uses broad - band ( @xmath19 kev ) count rate to filter flares .",
    "* this process mostly removed the soft proton contamination , but there could be some residual emission left .",
    "the resultant good exposure time after this filtering are @xmath20ks , @xmath21ks , and @xmath22ks for the mos1 , mos2 and pn cameras , respectively .",
    "note that the resulting pn exposures are shorter than the corresponding mos exposures . as reported in esas cookbook , this is likely due to the greater sensitivity of the pn detector , meaning that relatively smaller departures from the mean count rate are flagged as soft proton flares .    since we are interested in the diffuse emission , we need to remove any contribution to emission from point sources in the field .",
    "we detected the point sources and created the source list using the xmm - esas task _",
    "cheese_. the _ cheese _ task combines both mos and pn data for source detection creating images and exposure maps in a selected single band ( @xmath23@xmath24 kev ) .",
    "we have selected psf threshold parameter of _",
    "scale=0.2 _ which corresponds to point source removal down to a level where the surface brightness of a point source is 20% of the surrounding background .",
    "we set the detection limit ( flux in the energy band of @xmath23@xmath25kev ) of @xmath26erg @xmath3 s@xmath27 to create masks in order to remove the point sources .",
    "after removal of bad pixels and point sources , the active fields of view are @xmath28sr and @xmath29sr for the mos2 and pn respectively .",
    "we used the xmm - esas scripts _ pn - spectra _ and _ mos - spectra _ to extract spectra from the active fields of view .",
    "the spectral extraction scripts also calculated the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) and the ancillary response file ( arf ) for each spectrum , using the sas _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ tools , respectively .",
    "we run the scripts _",
    "mos_back _ and _ pn_back _ to calculate corresponding quiescent particle background ( qpb ) spectra .",
    "the qpb spectra were calculated from a database of filter - wheel - closed data , scaled to our observations using data from the unexposed regions of the cameras ( kuntz & snowden 2008 ) . before our spectral analysis",

    "the data reduction and analysis were carried out with heasoft version 6.16 and xspec 12.8.2 with atomdb ver.2.0.2 . in this work",
    ", we analyzed only the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis1 ) data , as this has the greatest sensitivity at low energies .",
    "we combined the data taken in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 observation mode using the ftool _",
    "@xmath32_. we first converted @xmath31 mode data to @xmath30 mode data and then merged both files with the help of ftool _",
    "ftmerge_. along with standard data processing ( e.g. elv @xmath33 and dye elv @xmath34 ) , we expanded data screening with the cut - off - rigidity ( cor ) of the earth s magnetic field , which varies as traverses its orbit . during times with larger cor values ,",
    "fewer particles are able to penetrate the satellite and the xis detectors .",
    "we excluded times when the cor was less than 8 gv , which is greater than the default value ( cor 4 gv ) , as lowest possible background is desired .",
    "suzaku s _ broad point spread function ( half - power diameter @xmath352 @xcite ) , it is hard to detect point sources .",
    "therefore we used the location of point sources determined in the xmm - newton observation and excluded a region of 2 radius around the source location .",
    "we run ftool _ xisrmfgen _ and _ xissimarfgen _ to produce the rmfs and arfs .",
    "for the arf calculations we assumed a uniform source of radius @xmath36 and used a detector mask which removed the bad pixel regions .",
    "we extracted the spectra of non - x - ray background from a database of the night earth data with ftool _",
    "xisnxbgen_.      509 was observed by hetg in 2012 for a total of @xmath37 ( obsid : 13864 & 13865 ) .",
    "the hetg is comprised of two gratings : the medium energy gratings ( meg ) and the high energy gratings ( heg ) , which disperse spectra into positive and negative spectral orders .",
    "since we are interested in oxygen absorption lines we used the data from meg only and reduced it using the standard chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software ( v4.6 ) and chandra calibration database ( caldb , v4.6.3 ) and followed the standard chandra data reduction threads ] .",
    "first we run the _ mkgrmf _ ciao script to create the first order positive and negative meg rmfs , needed for spectral analysis of grating observations .",
    "further , to increase the s / n we co - added the negative and positive first - order spectra with _ add_grating_orders _ and built the arfs using the _ fullgarf _ ciao script .",
    "we used xspec for spectral analysis of and data .",
    "we used the @xmath38 statistics as a goodness - of - fit measure and all errors are given at the @xmath39 confidence level .",
    "the goal of our and observations of _ off - field2 _ is to measure the contribution of galactic halo emission to the soft diffuse x - ray background ( sdxb ) near 509 .",
    "sdxb spectra have three distinct components : ( 1 ) a foreground component consisting of solar wind charge exchange ( swcx ) and the local bubble ( lb ) ; this is modeled as an unabsorbed plasma with thermal emission in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) ; ( 2 ) a background component made of unresolved extragalactic sources ; this is modeled with an absorbed power law ; and ( 3 ) galactic halo emission ; this is modeled as an equilibrium thermal plasma component absorbed by the gas in the galactic disk .",
    "both the galactic halo and foreground components ( swcx+lb ) have similar spectral shape , primarily x - ray lines from highly ionized metals , mostly and . as a result , disentangling",
    "the two is very difficult . to minimize the swcx contribution , which varies both in spectral composition and flux on scales of hours to days , we use proton flux filtering @xcite .",
    "we obtained the solar wind proton flux data from omniweb .",
    "figure 3 shows the solar wind proton flux during and observations of _ off - field2_. during the observation , solar wind proton flux is much higher than during the observation .",
    "we investigated the effect of the higher proton flux during observation by comparing surface brightness of k@xmath40 and k@xmath40 lines in and spectra . as expected , k@xmath40 line intensity is higher by about a factor of 1.5 during the observation compared to the observation ( table 2 ) , implying that the spectra have significant contamination from swcx .",
    "thus for further analysis we use only the spectrum of _ off - field2_.      we * simultaneously * fit the mos1 and mos2 filtered diffuse background spectra with the three component model noted above . even after the data cleaning described in  2.1 , there may remain some residual soft proton contamination ( snowden & kuntz 2011 ) .",
    "this is modeled as an additional powerlaw that was not folded through the instrumental response .",
    "we also modeled the instrumental al and si fluorescence lines at 1.49 and 1.74 kev respectively , with two gaussians .",
    "we use the _ apec _ model with plasma temperature of @xmath41k ( frozen ) and emission measure ( em ) of 0.0032  @xmath1pc ( frozen ) for the foreground component ( swcx plus lb ) .",
    "we determined the normalization / em of the foreground component using data from @xcite catalog of sxrb shadows as described in detail in paper - ii .",
    "we find 5 shadows in the catalog closest to our sightline with average foreground r12 count - rate of @xmath42counts  s@xmath43arcmin@xmath44 corresponding to em of @xmath45  @xmath1pc .",
    "the contribution from unresolved extragalactic sources is modeled with an absorbed power - law .",
    "the galactic column density was fixed to @xmath46@xmath3 @xcite , and power - law slope and normalization were left as free parameters in the spectral fit .    finally we determine the hotter galactic halo contribution , modeled as an equilibrium thermal plasma component absorbed by the gas in the galactic disk ( fig .",
    "we measured the galactic halo temperature of @xmath4 and emission measure of @xmath47@xmath1pc .",
    "the first error indicates the statistical error , and the second error indicates the estimated systematic error due to our assumed foreground spectra ( for details see paper - ii ) .",
    "the em towards 509 is unusually high , about five times the sky average of @xmath48@xmath1pc .",
    "@xcite have reported such high galactic halo em towards a filament in the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "pn spectrum is consistent with the mos model ( @xmath49 ) , though there are some residuals at energies @xmath50@xmath51 kev .",
    "this might be due to under- or over - estimation of the pn particle background as discussed at snowden & kuntz ( 2013 ) .",
    "thus for further calculations we use only the mos2 spectrum fit results ( @xcite have also used only the mos data for galactic halo emission measurements ) .",
    "for the spectral analysis of absorption along the sightline to mrk 509 , we binned the meg spectra to 0.01  and analyzed using the ciao fitting package _ sherpa .",
    "_    since we are interested in @xmath18 highly ionized metal lines we fit the continuum spectrum in the @xmath52    range with a powerlaw , absorbed by the galactic column density .",
    "509 is known to have intrinsic absorption ( kaastra et al .",
    "2014 and references there in ) , so we fit the intrinsic absorbers of 509 with multiple gaussians .    after fitting the continuum and intrinsic features , the @xmath18 k@xmath40 , k@xmath53 and k@xmath40 absorption lines are detected with more than 3@xmath54 significance ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "we fit these lines with narrow gaussian features of line width 1 m .",
    "the best - fit line parameters and errors ( calculated using the projection command in _ sherpa _ ) are given in table 3 and the spectrum is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the measured equivalent widths ( ews ) are consistent within 1@xmath54 error of our previous measurements ( paper - i ) done with the letg 2009 observation .",
    "the k@xmath40 absorption line is clearly saturated in the 509 data .",
    "the measured @xmath55 ratio is 0.56 , much higher than the expected ratio of 0.156 for optically thin lines .",
    "for the saturated lines like we observe here , converting the observed ews to column densities is non - trivial .",
    "we used the method described in detail at paper - i to obtain constraints on the column density : @xmath56 and the velocity dispersion parameter @xmath57@xmath58 .",
    "the measurement uncertainties are large due to the weak k@xmath53 line , but we can do better by using the code phase , as discussed below .",
    "our hybrid photo- and collisional - ionization code phase @xcite automatically takes into account line saturation by using voigt profiles to fit absorption lines .",
    "additional advantage of using the code is that it fits the entire 11.0 to 23    spectrum , taking into account lines which are not individually detected , providing better constraints .",
    "the fit provides constraints on the column density , velocity dispersion parameter and temperature of the absorbing plasma .",
    "best fit phase parameters are reported in table 4 and the spectrum is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the column density was found to be @xmath59 , somewhat lower than , but consistent with that noted above , and with much smaller errors .    in the mrk 509 spectrum",
    "we could determine the @xmath18 column density accurately ( @xmath60 ) even though the line was not individually detected .",
    "the velocity dispersion parameter obtained with phase fitting is @xmath61 ( where the lower limit is pegged at the hard limit ) and temperature @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath63-parameter is not well constrained , but is consistent with the value obtained from using the k@xmath40 and k@xmath53 line ratio noted above .",
    "we could not constrain the metallicity of the gas independently in phase ; assuming @xmath64 , the fit gives total equivalent hydrogen column density of @xmath65 @xmath3 ( table 4 ) .",
    "while the strength of an absorption line depends on the ionic column density of the intervening gas ( @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the electron density and @xmath68 is the path - length , and @xmath69 is the mean molecular weight ) , the emission is sensitive to the square of the number density ( @xmath70 , assuming a constant density plasma )",
    ". therefore a combination of absorption and emission measurements breaks the degeneracy and provides constraints on physical properties such as path - length and density of the absorbing / emitting gas .    from the phase model of z=0 absorption lines and galactic halo emission model",
    ", we constrained the temperature of the absorbing and emitting gas to @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively . since the temperature of the absorbing and emitting gas is the same , it is reasonable to assume that both absorption and emission arise in the same plasma .",
    "we can now combine the column density and emission measure to extract physical properties of the absorbing - emitting warm - hot gas .      assuming that absorbing / emitting plasma has a constant density we derive the density of :    @xmath73    and the path length of :    @xmath74    where the solar oxygen abundance of @xmath75 is from @xcite and @xmath76 is the ionization fraction of .",
    "simulations of the cgm around disk galaxies @xcite suggest the mean metallicity of gas is @xmath77 .",
    "these values of metallicities are also consistent with observational results for the outskirts of groups @xcite , clusters of galaxies @xcite and external galaxies @xcite . as",
    "path length is inversely proportional to the metallicity ( equation 2 ) , lower values of metallicity corresponds to larger path - length and consequently the higher mass .",
    "thus to be conservative , and consistent with our paper - i and paper - ii , we used @xmath78 .",
    "the cgm parameters along just one sightline are presented here , and as noted in  1 the milky way cgm is likely anisotropic .",
    "so we can not determine the cgm mass using parameters of only one sightline .",
    "nonetheless , for the sake of comparison with another density distribution such as the @xmath53-model discussed below , we will assume spherical symmetry and covering fraction of 1 of the warm - hot cgm gas with density and pathlength calculated above .",
    "this leads to the mass of the plasma @xmath79 . for a covering factor of @xmath80 used in paper - i ,",
    "the mass is @xmath81 .",
    "this is lower then the mass derived in paper - i ( @xmath82 ) ; this is largely due to the unusually high em along this sightline , which leads to larger density and smaller pathlength (  7 ) .      above ( and also in paper",
    "- i and paper - ii ) we had assumed a constant density plasma , but the galactic halo likely has a non - uniform density profile . since the em is biased toward high density , this could affect the results .",
    "a realistic halo is likely to have some density profile that falls with radius , so we should use a model with a reasonable density distribution and compare the model predictions to observations for obtaining constraints on the structure of the galactic cgm .    the distribution of the warm - hot gas around several elliptical galaxies follows a beta - model profile in which the density is high in the center and falls off with radius @xcite ; gas in clusters and groups of galaxies also follows similar profile @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite used the @xmath53 model to fit the radial surface brightness profile of hot halo gas around spiral galaxies .",
    "the @xmath53-model is given by    @xmath83^{-3\\beta/2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath84 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath85 is the central density , @xmath86 is the core radius and @xmath53 describes the shape .",
    "we have two measurements ( column density and emission measure ) and three unknowns ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath53 ) , so the parameters are degenerate .",
    "we first assumed @xmath53=0.5 in our calculations and then varied the value of @xmath53 to see its effect on the results .",
    "our sightline to 509 passes through the milky way halo along the direction fixed by the galactic coordinates ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) , and our measurements of absorption and emission are along this sightline .",
    "so we first converted @xmath89 to @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the pathlength along the sightline .",
    "we assumed that we are at 8  kpc from the galactic center and the virial radius of the galaxy is @xmath92kpc , providing the maximum pathlength for integration . using _",
    ", we then determined the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 which are consistent with both the absorption column density ( @xmath93 ) and the emission measure ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7 , where @xmath95 is plotted on the x - axis and @xmath86 on the y - axis .",
    "solid lines mark the best - fit and error contours for the observed column density and the dash lines are the same for the emission measure .",
    "the central density is constrained to be between @xmath96@xmath97 @xmath9 .",
    "for the core radius , however , we only have a lower limit @xmath98 kpc . for larger values of @xmath53 , the lower limit on @xmath86 increases ( @xmath99 kpc for @xmath100 ) ,",
    "the upper limit on @xmath85 becomes slightly smaller ( @xmath101 @xmath9 for @xmath100 ) , but the lower limit on @xmath85 remains the same .",
    "for @xmath102kpc ( lower limit ) and the corresponding @xmath103 @xmath9 , the mass within the virial radius of 250 kpc is @xmath104 . for the lower limit of density ( @xmath105 @xmath9 ) and the corresponding @xmath106kpc ,",
    "the mass is @xmath107(table 5 ) .",
    "similar to the milky way , other spiral galaxies should also have massive , extended reservoirs of ionized hot gas in the cgm .",
    "x - ray absorption line spectroscopy of galactic haloes is difficult because only a small number of agns are bright enough , but several authors have studied the halos around spiral galaxies in emission . most of these , however , are massive spiral galaxies , not milky way - type .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected hot gaseous halos in emission around the giant spiral galaxies ngc  1961 and ugc  12591 , extending to 40 - 50 and 110 kpc respectively .",
    "these authors estimates the mass of their hot halo gas to be @xmath108 and @xmath109 respectively within a radius of 50 kpc , and when density profiles are extrapolated to virial radii of 500 kpc , the implied hot halo mass is @xmath110 .",
    "similarly @xcite have detected x - ray emission around two other spiral galaxies ngc  6753 and ngc  266 and estimated the hot x - ray gas mass within @xmath111kpc to be @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "though the detected masses in hot halos of these galaxies are significant , it is not a major contributor to the galactic missing baryons because these are very massive galaxies ; it falls short by an order of magnitude .",
    "around low mass ( milky way type ) spiral galaxies , the picture is a bit different .",
    "@xcite using observations found diffuse x - ray emitting halos in eight nearby ( @xmath114mpc ) galaxies extending to radii of @xmath115kpc .",
    "since these are very nearby galaxies , the field of view probes only a 20  kpc region around the galaxies . with observation",
    ", @xcite confirmed the x - ray halo of ngc  4631 ( @xmath116 ) extending out to about 10 kpc from the galactic disk . with , @xcite detect the diffuse gaseous x - ray halos extended over a range of 4 - 10 kpc around nine nearby star - forming edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "but these observations ( @xmath117ks ) are not deep enough to detect soft x - ray halos extending out to large radii .",
    "recently @xcite searched for the hot coronae around lower mass spiral galaxies with stellar masses of ( @xmath118  @xmath24 ) @xmath119m@xmath11 using acis observations .",
    "they did not detect a statistically significant hot corona around any of their sample galaxies .",
    "the authors noted that the low effective area of acis - i or smaller field - of - view of acis - s might be reasons for the non - detections .",
    "so we see that the observations of milky way - type galaxies were either too shallow or with too small a field of view to detect extended , massive cgms .",
    "extended , massive cgms are detected around massive spiral galaxies , but they do not contribute significantly to the baryon budget .",
    "why some spiral galaxies have a large fraction of baryons in their cgm and some do not ?",
    "the extent of the cgm in a galaxy and the fraction of missing baryons it contains may depend on several properties of a galaxy : stellar mass @xcite , specific star formation rate @xcite , or dark matter halo mass @xcite .",
    "all the three reasons could be related as galaxies with higher mass have substantially lower specific star formation rates @xcite and feedback may affect both the star formation rate and stellar mass . radio - mode feedback may expel gas from a galaxy leading to both smaller stellar mass and less massive cgm @xcite . in the simulations of @xcite ,",
    "the fraction of hot gas mass in more massive galaxies is indeed smaller .",
    "in paper i we had assumed a constant density model to determine the cgm parameters of the milky way .",
    "we found a huge reservoir of baryonic mass of over @xmath120 .",
    "this result was criticized by some who argued that the mass is overestimated because of the assumption of constant density ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see mathur 2012 and references therein ) . in paper",
    "ii we made logical arguments and showed mathematically that that is not the case . on the contrary , any non - uniform density profile with density falling with radius would necessarily lead to larger mass estimates . here",
    "we confirm our arguments by comparing the constant density model with a @xmath53-model .",
    "even the lower limit on mass is comparable to that with a constant density ( see table 5 ) , and is over twice as much for the lower limit on the central density .",
    "cgms also likely have a radial temperature profile , but we do not have observational constraints to determine the temperature profile , so we assume constant temperature . with more sightlines we will have more observables to determine the temperature profile .",
    "we note that @xcite also assume that the mean gas temperature is constant as a function of radius in their theoretical model .",
    "another matter of contention in literature is the location of the warm - hot gas , whether in the ism of the galactic disk , the cgm , or beyond . in paper - ii",
    "we had argued that the galactic ism can not be the major contributor to the @xmath18 absorption lines .",
    "here we constrain the core radius of the absorbing / emitting gas to be over @xmath121kpc , clearly ruling out the ism origin and placing the gas in the cgm of the galaxy ( see also nicastro et al .",
    "2016a ) .",
    "in paper - i we had used sky - average values of column density and emission measure , with @xmath122 ( @xmath3 ) @xmath123 , and @xmath124@xmath1pc .",
    "what we find here , along the 509 sightline is @xmath122 ( @xmath3 ) @xmath125 , and @xmath126@xmath1pc .",
    "thus , along the 509 sightline the column density is larger by 0.2  dex and the emission measure is larger by a factor of @xmath127 . as a result ,",
    "the density along this sightline is larger than average and the pathlength smaller than average ( for a constant density model as in paper - i ) .",
    "the parameters along the two sightlines presented in paper - ii are : @xmath122 ( @xmath3 ) @xmath128 & @xmath129 , and @xmath130@xmath1pc & @xmath131@xmath1pc , respectively .",
    "this underscores the value of measuring absorption and emission along the same sightline to derive the physical properties of the warm - hot gas .",
    "we should do so for several sightlines through the mw - cgm to understand its average properties and anisotropy .",
    "part of the anisotropy would arise from our location in the galaxy as different sightlines would probe different parts of the galactic cgm ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "but part of the anisotropy could also be intrinsic , as suggested by simulations of @xcite .",
    "we will investigate this further with more sightlines with absorption and emission observations .    in figure 8",
    "we have plotted the @xmath6model profile in the 509 direction together with the profile obtained by @xcite , which is the @xcite profile .",
    "the maller & bullock profile specifies the density and temperature profiles for adiabatic hot gas with polytropic index @xmath132 in hydrostatic equilibrium in an nfw dark matter potential well .",
    "we see that shape of their profile is similar to our @xmath6model profile for the lower limit of @xmath86 , although our density is higher",
    ". our lower limit on the central density is similar to theirs , but our corresponding profile is flatter . given that the @xmath6model we present here is deduced from only one sightline , and that too with unusually high emission measure , the differences are not surprising .",
    "recently @xcite presented an analytic phenomenological model for warm - hot cgms of l@xmath133 galaxies .",
    "the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in a milky way gravitational potential .",
    "they find the median temperature of the hot gas to be @xmath134 k , similar to what we find for the mw cgm .",
    "they also find the cgm to be extended , slightly beyond the virial radius , and massive with @xmath135 , accounting for missing baryons in galaxies in the local universe .",
    "these results , as well as those from @xcite and other theoretical models noted in  1 , provide strong support for our results on the milky way cgm .    in these works the density distribution of the warm - hot gas is presented as a smooth profile .",
    "it is possible , however , that the gas is clumpy and this could have a noticeable impact on model fits because emission measures scale with @xmath136 while absorption scales with @xmath137 .",
    "recent theoretical simulations by @xcite show the presence of filamentary structure in the cgm . in future work when we have emission and absorption measurements along several directions , we will include clumping factors @xmath138 in our models to assess their impact on our interpretation , and we will look at hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation for guidance about expected levels of clumping and anisotropy .",
    "we note , however , that in contrast to the cool cgm component traced by high - velocity hi clouds , we expect the hot gas component detectable in x - ray data to be relatively smooth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite include clumping in their models , but the higher density clumped gas is cooler , traced by and the hotter gas , probed by and is indeed smooth .    to conclude , the hot gaseous cgm of the milky way appears to be diffuse and extended .",
    "the cgm is clearly anisotropic as shown by the distributions of both absorption and emission measurements .",
    "we have determined the properties of the hot cgm by combining absorption and emission measurements along three sightlines , two of which were presented in paper - ii and one is presented in this paper .",
    "additionally in this paper we have fitted the absorption spectrum with a theoretical collisional - ionization model , obtaining tight constraints on the temperature of the gas .",
    "we have also added a @xmath6model density profile and show that the cgm remains diffuse , extended and massive .",
    "our results are consistent with numerical simulations as well as analytic models and suggest that a large fraction of the mw missing baryons reside in its hot cgm .",
