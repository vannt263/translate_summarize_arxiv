    "very recently , we have developed an effective field theory to describe the nonperturbative qcd dynamics of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "this theory has incorporated in it heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , and is thus consistent with heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) in the infinite quark mass ( @xmath5 ) limit . in this effective field theory ,",
    "a heavy meson is considered as a composite particle consisting of a reduced heavy quark ( heavy quark in the @xmath5 limit ) coupled with the light degrees of freedom . a structure function @xmath6 , corresponding to the wave function of the heavy meson bound state ,",
    "is introduced to describe the quark - meson vertex in the effective lagrangian . by combining such an effective lagrangian for the composite heavy mesons with the @xmath7 expansion of the heavy quark qcd lagrangian",
    ", we can systematically evaluate various @xmath7 corrections to heavy meson properties in a covariant field - theoretic framework @xcite .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite , the heavy meson wave function @xmath6 is taken to be a phenomenological function .",
    "specifically it is assumed to be a lorentzian function , @xmath8 , in which the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are determined phenomenologically by fitting to the @xmath11 meson decay constant @xmath12 ; hence its relation to nonperturbative low - energy qcd dynamics is not clear . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to determine the heavy meson wave function from a qcd - based bound state equation .",
    "the bound state equation of heavy mesons is obtain from the heavy quark equation of motion in hqet which is incorporated in our effective field theory .",
    "this heavy meson bound state equation is a covariant extension of the light - front bound state equation we obtained recently from light - front qcd and hqet@xcite . with the bound state equation for @xmath6",
    ", we can use a variational procedure to determine its soluton .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we derive from the heavy quark equation of motion in the heavy quark limit and our effective heavy meson field theory the heavy meson bound state equation . then a variational method is used to determine the heavy meson wave function @xmath6 by minimizing the reduced mass ( binding energy ) of the heavy meson @xmath0 . in the literature ,",
    "@xmath0 has only been estimated either from heavy meson mass spectrum or from inclusive heavy meson decay data @xcite .",
    "a direct calculation of @xmath0 has not been carried out to date . in sec .",
    "iii , we consistently calculate the other two basic hqet parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 directly from the operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 in hqet .",
    "having self - consistently calculated @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we can then extract from experimental heavy meson masses the heavy quark masses ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) at the low energy scale where our effective field theory applies .",
    "such a procedure establishes a link between our heavy meson effective field theory and nonperturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "finally a summary is given in sec .",
    "before deriving the heavy meson bound state equation , we shall briefly review the heavy meson effecive field theory we developed recently @xcite . in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , the qcd lagrangian is expanded in powers of @xmath7 : @xmath15 where the reduced heavy quark field @xmath16 is defined from the full heavy quark field @xmath17 by @xmath18 @xmath19 is the heavy quark four velocity which is defined to be equal to that of the parent heavy meson , and @xmath20 .",
    "it is easily seen that the leading term @xmath21 in eq.([1me ] ) possesses a @xmath22 flavor - spin symmetry ( or simply heavy quark symmetry , hqs ) , whereas the symmetry breaking part @xmath23 contains @xmath7 corrections to @xmath24 .",
    "the effective lagrangian we have constructed to describe the low energy dynamics of heavy mesons reads @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent respectively the composite pseudoscalar and vector heavy meson fields which appear only as external states , @xmath28 is their common residual mass in the heavy quark limit , @xmath29 represents collectively the light degrees of freedom in a heavy meson , where @xmath30 is heavy meson wave function mentioned earlier , @xmath31 is the light antiquark momentum , and @xmath32 is the normalization constant given by @xmath33    in eq.([hqel ] ) , @xmath34 obeys hqs and defines the nonperturbative effective coupling of heavy mesons with their constituent heavy and light quarks , while @xmath23 , which contains all the @xmath7 corrections , is considered as a perturbation to @xmath34 .",
    "a practical calculational scheme has been developed in terms of the feynman diagrammatic rules summarized below @xcite :    \\(i ) a heavy meson bound state ( @xmath35 ) couples to its constituent heavy and light quarks via a three - point vertex @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 for pseudoscalar @xmath39 , @xmath40 for vector mesons @xmath41 , and @xmath31 is the momentum of the light degrees of freedom .",
    "each vertex also carries a momentum conservation factor of @xmath42 .",
    "\\(ii ) the internal heavy quark and light quark propagators are , @xmath43 respectively , where @xmath44 is the residual momentum of the heavy quark , and @xmath45 the constituent mass of the light quark .",
    "\\(iii ) an integration factor @xmath46 is associated with each internal momentum @xmath47 , and a factor @xmath48 should be included for each fermion loop .",
    "\\(iv ) for all other lines and vertices not attached to heavy mesons ( mostly from @xmath23 ) , standard feynman rules apply .",
    "hence @xmath7 corrections to various quantities can be calculated using standard field theoretic perturbative approach @xcite .      in hqet",
    ", the reduced heavy quark field @xmath16 obeys the following equation of motion @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the qcd covariant derivative .    to ensure that our effective field theory , eq.([hqel ] ) , is consistent with low energy qcd dynamics of hqet , eq.([1me ] ) , we require that in the heavy quark limit , the heavy meson state @xmath51 satisfies @xmath52 strickly speaking , this matrix element must be calculated in a nonperturbative manner of qcd , which is however beyond our present day knowledge of qcd . to circumvent this predicament , we shall adopt an effective gluon propagator which contains a long - distance contribution as well as the familiar perturbative one @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the qcd coupling constant , and the coefficient @xmath55 characterizes the confining strength .",
    "note that the regularized infrared singular term @xmath56 can be effectively considered as a regularization of the linearly confining interaction @xmath57 @xcite . representing this effective gluon propagator by a double wavy line",
    ", we can depict the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hqem ] ) pictorially by feynman diagrams shown in fig . 1 .    as discussed in @xcite , from the constraint that it forbids on - mass - shell decay of the heavy meson into @xmath58 , a possible form of the heavy meson wave function @xmath59",
    "is given by @xmath60 where the function @xmath61 is regular at @xmath62 .",
    "then , applying the diagrammatic rules stated in sec .",
    "iia to fig . 1",
    ", we can easily translate eq.([hqem ] ) into the following expression , @xmath63 where the color factor @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the above equation can be rewritten as an equivalent bound state equation for heavy mesons : @xmath66 which is indeed a covariant generalization of the light - front bound state equation for heavy mesons we have previously derived @xcite , and it is also the heavy quark limit of the bethe - salpeter equation for heavy mesons .    using the normalization condition of @xmath59",
    ", we can simplified eq.([eqm2 ] ) to @xmath67 the physical meaning of the above result is clear .",
    "the heavy meson binding energy @xmath0 defined by eq.([lmb ] ) consists of two parts : one is the light quark kinetic energy contribution @xmath68 , and the other is the interaction energy of the heavy - light system . note that , due to the effective gluon propagator ( [ egp ] ) used , the interaction energy contains a confining contribution , as well as the color coulomb contribution .      in this section",
    "we shall determine the heavy meson wave function @xmath69 through a variational procedure .",
    "the first step is to choose an appropriate trial wave function . as discussed in @xcite , we demand",
    "that the wave function should be relatively well behaved , by which we mean that , when continued into the complex @xmath31 plane , ( i ) @xmath61 is analytic except for isolated singularities , and ( ii ) it vanishes  fast enough \" as @xmath70 .",
    "these two constraints also allow us to easily derive various relativisitic and/or light - front quark models results as special cases in our effective field theory @xcite .    in various existing light - front or relativistic quark models , two types of distribution functions",
    "have been widely adopted for phenomenological hadronic wave functions .",
    "one is the exponential(gaussian)-type and the other the lorentzian - type .",
    "the former can be excluded since it does not simultaneously satisfy the two constraints stated above @xcite . on the other hand , we find that lorentzian - type functions of the form , @xmath71 do meet our requirements @xcite , and will be taken as the working trial heavy meson wave function in this work .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a choice of @xmath69 corresponds to a covariant light - front wave function @xcite of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a normalization constant , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is required to ensure convergence .    for the sake of demonstration",
    ", we first consider the naive case of ignoring of the confining interaction between the heavy quark and the light degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath76 , so that color coulomb interaction is solely responsible for binding the quarks together .",
    "we find that , for @xmath77 , a minimum with @xmath78 gev can be found at @xmath79 .",
    "however a wave function with such a small @xmath9 is unrealistic because it contains too little high momentum components . in other words , the wave function",
    "is too extended in configuration space , as would be expected since we have ignored the confining part of the inter - quark interaction .    with an appropriate non - zero @xmath80 , physically sensible results can be obtained . in",
    "what follows , we will take @xmath81 and @xmath82 gev , which are close to the values used in our previous work @xcite . with the confinement strength taken to be @xmath83 gev",
    ", we determine the wave function parameter @xmath9 by minimizing @xmath0 .",
    "the results are listed in the table i , where @xmath84 which is not sensitive to the choice of @xmath10 .",
    "this value of @xmath0 is somewhat larger than our previous result of @xmath85 gev obtained in @xcite .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the confinement effect which is not considered there .",
    "0.5 cm    it is worth emphasizing that , in our previous work @xcite , the parameter @xmath9 is fixed phenomenologically by fitting to @xmath86 mev from lattice gauge calculations ( it is experimentally unknown ) . in the present work , we have dynamically",
    "determine the wave function @xmath87 by minimizing the blinding energy @xmath0 from the qcd - based bound state equation .",
    "this is a significant improvement which helps to raise the predictive power of our heavy meson effective theory .",
    "in this section , we shall use the bound state solution obtained in the previous section to calculate heavy meson masses up to order @xmath7 .",
    "this will in turn yield more consistent results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 than those obtained in @xcite .    in the heavy quark limit",
    ", the heavy meson masses can be written as @xmath88 .",
    "the correction to @xmath89 in hqet comes mainly from the leading hqs - breaking @xmath7 corrections [ see eq .",
    "( [ hqel ] ) ] : @xmath90 where @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath92 $ ] . with these @xmath7 corrections",

    "we know that hqs and confinement mechanism are crucial ingredients of nonperturbative qcd dynamics in heavy hadrons",
    ". however they are rarely incorporated in quark models in a fully covariant manner . in this work ,",
    "we attempt to establish a link between quark model and low - energy qcd dynamics in an effective field theoretic approach , in which the heavy meson wave function is determined variationally .",
    "our effective theory preserves the simplicity of a conventional quark model ; in fact , for heavy quark transitions , we can reproduce the covariant light - front quark model @xcite as a special case .",
    "the light - front quark model has been widely used to describe heavy meson structures . however , because its relation to qcd is not clear , it is incapable of describing the hadronic mass spectrum . moreover ,",
    "the model is not fully covariant , so that it can only describe physical processes with space - like momentum transfers @xcite . in the present formalism",
    ", we can study hadronic bound state physics in a covariant framework ; moreover , a connection to low - energy qcd dynamics has also been established .",
    "thus our heavy meson effective theory , together with the nonperturbatively determinated heavy meson wave function , provides a useful qcd based framework in which to study heavy quark physics in the low energy regime .",

    "a great advantage of our formalism is that we can unambiguously study hadronic transition processes at arbitrary momentum transfers . using the heavy meson wave function determined in this paper",
