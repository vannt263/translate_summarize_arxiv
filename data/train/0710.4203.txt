    ".    in di - hadron correlations from central au+au collisions the away - side jet opposing the high @xmath3 triggered particle disappears  @xcite , while the remnants of the away - side jet are recovered at lower @xmath7 values  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of these remnants in @xmath6 is highly modified in comparison to p+p collisions : the away - side correlation is no longer peaked at @xmath8 but instead has two peaks shifted to either side of @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to account for this splitting  @xcite . and",
    "the analysis of three particles correlations is being pursued as one method to differentiate scenarios from jet deflection to cone emission of particles  @xcite .",

    "an increase in the ratio of baryons to mesons has been observed in au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "this increase may depend on the parton density of the system .",
    "the coalescence of constituent quarks has been used to describe successfully much of the observed phenomena . by extension",
    ", one might expect a larger baryon - to - meson ratio for intermediate @xmath7 hadrons on the away - side due to the coalescence of quenched fragments with each other or with constituents from the medium .",
    "studies of the @xmath10 ratio show evidence for such an effect  @xcite .",
    "information about the relative contribution of quarks and gluons may also be inferred from the antibaryon - to - baryon ratio : the fragmentation of gluon jets yields a larger antibaryon - to - baryon ratio than the fragmentation of quark jets  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , if the splitting of the away - side jet is linked to large - angle gluon radiation , then the antibaryon - to - baryon ratio should increase at angles away from @xmath8 .",
    "the presence of these gluons may also contribute to an increase in the baryon - to - meson ratio : a recent study found that the baryon density is largest in collision processes involving gluons ( i.e. qg , gg , q@xmath11 g , or ggg )  @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , measurements of the baryon - to - meson ratio and the antibaryon - to - baryon ratio on the near- and away - side of jets should be useful for understanding the interaction of fast partons with the medium .",
    "we will present measurements of di - hadron correlations of unidentified trigger hadrons with identified @xmath12 , @xmath1 , or @xmath13 associated partners . for this analysis ,",

    "the same procedure is carried out on a mixed event sample to obtain a background distribution used to correct for imperfect detector acceptance .",
    "the @xmath18 modulated background distribution is subtracted from the corrected @xmath17 distribution by zero - yield at the minimum ( zyam )  @xcite or zero - yield at @xmath19 ( zya1 ) .",

    "is seen on the near - side of the charged hadron trigger ( @xmath26 ) as would be expected from fragmentation of a fast parton or jet .",
    "the correlation structure on the away - side of the trigger hadron changes with the collision centrality . from the central to peripheral , the away - side shows a double bump , broadened and a single peak .",
    "this is consistent with the di - hadron distributions from star  @xcite . in the central collision ,",
    "the away - sides exhibit a minimum at @xmath8 where typically a maximum would exist .",
    "these features are similar to those already observed for unidentified di - hadron distributions which have much better statistics  @xcite .",
    "we extract the conditional yields of identified @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 particles on the near - side ( @xmath27 ) and away - side ( @xmath28 ) of the trigger hadron .    in fig .",

    "the right panel shows the @xmath33 ratio for p+p , mid - peripheral @xmath32  @xcite , and central @xmath32 collisions scaled by 0.5 .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath30 ratio made for particles associated with a trigger hadron ( @xmath34 ) from phenix are also shown in the left panel while our results are shown in the right panel .",
    "we find that both star and phenix measurements are consistent with a larger baryon - to - meson ratio on the away - side than on the near - side .",
    "in addition , on the near - side the baryon - to - meson ratio is closer to values measured in p+p collisions while on the away - side the ratio is closer to that measured in central or mid - central au+au collisions .",
    "this observation may indicate that the larger parton density of matter is traversed by the away - side jet .",
    "this larger parton density may lead to an enhancement in baryon production .",
    "such an effect is expected if the baryon enhancement in the intermediate @xmath7 region observed in au+au collisions is due to multi - parton interactions such as gluon junction  @xcite or quark coalescence  @xcite .",
    "more information can be obtained from the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by examining how the ratios depend on @xmath6 : _",
    "e.g. _ the ratios of the conditional yields on the away - side can help us better understand the source of the correlations that appear at large angles away from @xmath8 .",
    "it has been speculated that the enhanced correlations at wide angles may be related to large angle gluon radiation  @xcite , deflection of the away - side jet by the flowing medium  @xcite , or a shock wave that is induced in the medium by a fast moving parton  @xcite .",
    "we expect the dependence of the particle ratios on @xmath6 to differ in the three above scenarios : _ e.g. _ gluons radiated at large angles may lead to a larger antibaryon - to - baryon ratio in that region .",
    "a recent study also found that the presence of these gluons may also lead to an enhanced baryon - to - meson ratio  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the higher density that would be associated with a shock - wave could lead to an increase in the baryon - to - meson ratio via coalescence of co - moving partons .",
    "it has also been argued that since a shock wave should be moving at the speed of sound in the medium , the particles produced from such a shock should not be very fast particles . for a slow particle to satisfy the @xmath7 cut in our analysis it would have to be massive .",
    "for this reason , one might expect the correlation at large angles to have a larger number of massive particles and consequently a larger baryon - to - meson ratio .",
    "detailed calculations of particle ratios from the above scenarios have not been made but are being pursued by us .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the particle ratios ( ratios of the conditional yields ) on the away - side as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the ratios are normalized by the corresponding ratio measured in the near - side jet - cone so that unity corresponds to the case where the away - side particle composition is the same as that in the near - side jet cone .",
    "we find that this double ratio is largely independent of the elliptic flow used in the background subtraction indicating that such an analysis is able to reduce systematic uncertainties .",
    "the left panel shows the baryon - to - meson , awayside - to - nearside double ratio and the right panel shows the antibaryon - to - baryon , awayside - to - nearside double ratio . in both cases the data from @xmath35 ( closed symbols )",
    "has been reflected to @xmath36 ( open symbols ) .",
    "the uncertainty on both measurements remains large and precludes strong conclusions about the shape or magnitude of the ratios .",
    "we observe some indication that the @xmath37 ratios may be large at around @xmath38 than they are at @xmath8 .",
    "this may be consistent , for example , with the increase of the parton density at large angles as discussed above .",
    "we measured di - hadron azimuthal angle correlations in au+au collisions at @xmath5 = 200 gev .",
    "charged hadrons ( @xmath39 gev / c ) are used as the trigger particle ; @xmath0s , @xmath1s and @xmath13s ( @xmath40 gev / c ) are used as the associated particles .",
    "we extracted the conditional yields of identified associate particles on the near- and away - side of the jet trigger and calculated the near and away - side particle ratios .",
    "the systematic uncertainty from @xmath18 and the background normalization are large .",
    "these uncertainties can be reduced with more data to reduce the error on the level of the background and a better understanding of @xmath18 to reduce uncertainty on the shape of the background .",
    "both star and phenix results are consistent with a larger baryon - to - meson ratio on the away - side than the near - side .",
    "we studied the shape of away - side particle ratios and find that this shape is insensitive to several sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "our measurements are consistent with the physical picture that the parton density may be higher at large angles away from @xmath8 .",
