    "in @xcite , the author set up a geometric theory of modular forms of weight @xmath2 for odd positive integers @xmath3 , complete with geometrically defined hecke operators .",
    "this approach naturally led to a theory of overconvergent @xmath0-adic modular forms of such weights equipped with a hecke action for which @xmath1 is compact .",
    "in this paper we define overconvergent half - integral weight @xmath0-adic modular forms of general @xmath0-adic weights , as well as rigid - analytic families thereof over admissible open subsets of weight space .",
    "we use the latter spaces and buzzard s eigenvariety machine ( @xcite ) to construct a half - integral weight eigencurve parameterizing all systems of eigenvalues of hecke operators occurring on spaces of half - integral weight overconvergent eigenforms of finite slope .",
    "in contrast to the integral weight situation , this space _ does not _",
    "parameterize actual forms because a half - integral weight form that is an eigenform for all hecke operators is not always characterized by its weight and collection of hecke eigenvalues .",
    "we also prove an analog of coleman s result that overconvergent eigenforms of suitably low slope are classical .",
    "this paper lays the foundation for a forthcoming paper of the author in which we construct a map from our half - integral weight eigencurve to its integral weight counterpart ( at least after passage to the underlying reduced spaces ) that rigid - analytically interpolates the classical shimura lifting introduced in @xcite .",

    "the symbol @xmath5 will always denote a complete and discretely - valued field extension of @xmath6 .",
    "for such @xmath5 we denote the ring of integers by @xmath7 and the maximal ideal therein by @xmath8 . the absolute value on @xmath5 will always be normalized by @xmath9 .      for positive integers @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 will denote the usual moduli stacks of generalized elliptic curves with level structure .",
    "the former classifies generalized elliptic curves with a point @xmath14 of order @xmath10 while the latter classifies generalized elliptic curves with a pair @xmath15 consisting of a point @xmath14 of order @xmath10 and a cyclic subgroup @xmath16 of order @xmath11 meeting the subgroup generated by @xmath14 trivially ( plus a certain ampleness condition for non - smooth curves ) .",
    "this level structure will always be taken to be the drinfeld - style level structure found in @xcite , @xcite , and the appendix to this paper , and in all cases the base ring will be a @xmath17-algebra .    throughout this paper",
    "we will make extensive use of certain admissible opens in rigid spaces associated to some of these modular curves .",
    "traditionally these opens were defined using the eisenstein series @xmath18 , but this requires that we pose unfavorable restrictions on @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "fortunately , more recent papers of buzzard ( @xcite ) and goren - kassaei ( @xcite ) define these opens and explore their properties in greater generality using alternative techniques .",
    "these authors define a `` measure of singularity '' @xmath19 associated to an elliptic curve over a complete extension of @xmath6 . in case @xmath20",
    ", one may associate to @xmath21 a canonical subgroup @xmath22 of order @xmath0 in an appropriately functorial manner .",
    "moreover , one understands @xmath23 for finite cyclic subgroups @xmath24 as well as the canonical subgroup of @xmath25 when it exists .",

    "we will denote the tate elliptic curve over @xmath29 by @xmath30 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our notational conventions concerning the tate curve differ from those often found in the literature as follows . in the presence of , for example , level @xmath10 structure ,",
    "previous authors ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) have preferred to consider the curve @xmath31 over the base @xmath29",

    "we prefer to fix the curve @xmath30 and instead consider _ extensions _ of the base .",

    "there is no reason for @xmath72 to be finite in general , but in case @xmath73 is affinoid then this is indeed finite and endows @xmath74 with the structure of a banach space over @xmath5 as we now demonstrate .",

    "then , for any section @xmath91 , we may write @xmath92 for a unique @xmath93 , and one easily checks that @xmath94 the desired assertion now follows easily from the analogous assertion about the supremum norm on a reduced affinoid .",

    "but this is impossible because by power - multiplicativity we have @xmath112 for all @xmath113",
    ". thus @xmath114 must be non - vanishing at some point of @xmath108 . by the surjectivity of the specialization map we can find a point @xmath65 reducing to this point .",
    "clearly then @xmath115 , which establishes the normal case .",

    "the generic fiber @xmath118 is an admissible open in @xmath100 and therefore has dimension @xmath116 .",

    "let @xmath119 be the normalization map ( meaning @xmath120 applied to the normalization map on algebras ) and note that this map is finite by general excellence considerations .",
    "by theorem 2.1.3 of @xcite the generic fiber of this map coincides with the normalization of @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath121 is also equidimensional of dimension @xmath116 and the argument above shows that @xmath122 is equidimensional of dimension @xmath116 as well .",
    "now since @xmath123 is finite it follows that @xmath124 carries generic points to generic points .",
    "in particular we see that @xmath125 is zariski - dense in @xmath122 .",
    "thus by the normal case proven above there exists @xmath126 reducing to @xmath125 at which @xmath99 ( thought of as an element of @xmath127 ) attains its supremum norm .",

    "note that the proof in the normal case did not use the equidimensionality hypothesis .",
    "this hypothesis may not be required in the general case , but the above proof breaks down without it since it is not clear how to control the special fiber under normalization in general , especially if @xmath56 is non - reduced ( as is often the case for us ) .",

    "we feel that it is worthwhile to give more natural definitions using the above norm machinery in the cases that it applies to ( those where we have nice moduli schemes to work with ) in the hopes that the techniques used and the above corollary will be useful in other similar situations .",

    "this technique of division to reduce to weight zero in order to define modular forms forces us to modify the usual construction of the hecke operators using the hecke correspondences on the curve @xmath12 by multiplying by certain functions on the source spaces of these correspondences .",
    "our first task is to define these functions and to establish their overconvergence properties .",
