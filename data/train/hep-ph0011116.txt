    "@xcite showed that by analyzing the sequence of occurrence of the first zeros of the denominator and numerator of a pad approximant beta function , one can separate out two possible behaviors of pad qcd couplant in the infra - red ( ir ) region .",
    "the couplant may exhibit an ir attractor behavior of kogan - shifman type  @xcite in which the pqcd couplant bifurcates at some critical cut - off momentum @xmath1 into a second ( upper ) branch , in a manner that leaves the infra - red region @xmath2 totally free of any pqcd color force and its bifurcated branch .",
    "we may call this scenario ii .",
    "the alternative scenario i is that the pqcd couplant freezes at the critical momentum point @xmath3 , being its stable infra - red fixed point , and remains so frozen for all @xmath2 in the manner of mattingly - stevenson  @xcite .",
    "the finding of elias et .",
    "al . by their denominator - numerator zero approach",
    "is that scenario ii holds for all @xmath4 , regardless of which pad approximants , @xmath5 , [ 2|1 ] , [ 1|3 ] , [ 3|1]$ ] , or @xmath6 $ ] they used . on the other hand",
    ", they found that scenario i holds for all @xmath7 .",
    "for the flavor numbers , @xmath8 , their method led to indeterminate results .",
    "their positive denominator zeros ceased to exist for @xmath9 , but then their numerator zeros were found to be negative for @xmath8 . as a result their method did not resolve the above question for these flavor states of pad qcd .",
    "we have re - examined the above question , using a graphical method to analyze the pad qcd couplant equation of evolution , and applying this not only to the nnnlo @xmath10 , [ 1|2]$ ] pad approximants studied by elias et .",
    "al . but also to the optimized @xmath11 $ ] pad approximant more directly related to the optimized nnlo truncated pqcd beta function studied by mattingly and stevenson .    while confirming some of the findings of elias et",
    ", we found substantially new features .",
    "in particular , we found for all flavors , not just the elias et . al .",
    "bifurcation at momentum point @xmath12 , but a second bifurcation at @xmath13 , where in all cases @xmath14 .",
    "more explicitly , we found the pad couplant equation yielding three independent solutions or component couplants @xmath15 that are however joined together into a continuous chain - like spiral structure at the two momentum points @xmath16 and @xmath17 that can be called couplant bifurcation points .",
    "the @xmath18 solution arising from the second bifurcation , is found to increase towards lower energies , running past the original pqcd bifurcation point at @xmath19 , into the region @xmath20 , the implication being that this @xmath18 second bifurcation upper branch is either a genuine npqcd component , or else a persisting landau pole structure coming from the original truncated pqcd beta function on which the pad beta function was based .    by noting from our graphical structures and plots , that the momentum gap @xmath21 is not zero for all @xmath7",
    ", we found that scenario ii actually holds also for the flavor states @xmath7 as for all @xmath22 , in difference to the findings of elias et .",
    "the only amplification is that one has to go to sufficiently low momentum to see the persisting infra - red attractor points at @xmath23 .",
    "this apart , the gap @xmath2 remains finite and empty of any pqcd couplant even for the highest flavors @xmath24 .",
    "the result is our new feature that there is intrinsically in pad qcd , no couplant freezing for all flavors @xmath0 .",
    "we present the above analysis and findings as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we collect together the basic qcd couplant equations we need , together with their pad approximants , and the optimized formulation of the particular nnlo pad beta function . in section 3",
    ", we present our numerical and graphical method of solving the pad qcd couplant equations of orders @xmath11 , [ 2|1 ] , [ 1|2]$ ] that we considered . then in sections 4 and 5 , we state the main features and results we found with these pad qcds . in section 6 , we use our graphical method to show explicitly that infra - red scenario ii holds intrinsically for all flavors @xmath0 . in section 7",

    "al  @xcite , and given by @xmath36 , where    @xmath37    the rest of the coefficients @xmath38 are unknown so that qcd in making any direct use of eqn  ( [ eq : ndili2 ] ) can at most use only the following truncated beta functions ;    1 .   the leading order form ( lo ) , where @xmath39 is truncated to : + @xmath40 2 .   the next - to - leading order form ( nlo ) , where @xmath39 is truncated to : + @xmath41 3 .",

    "[ fig : ndili48 ] and  [ fig : ndili52 ] , one soon sees that @xmath171 and @xmath172 are still separate or bifurcated component couplants and that the pqcd couplant @xmath171 did not freeze at all .",
    "we conclude finally that our pad qcd graphical computations and findings , can be relied upon , being consistent with the independent pad beta function numerator / denominator zero analysis of elias et .",
    "al . ; and also consistent with the direct pqcd ir computations of banks and zaks , and stevenson et . al .",
    "we have presented a reliable and consistent graphical computational method of analyzing the infra - red structure of pad approximant qcds .",
    "we have shown with the method that the intrinsic behavior of pad qcd is one in the pqcd bifurcates at some critical kogan - shifman type momentum @xmath212 , leaving the infra - red region @xmath2 totally decoupled from the pqcd dynamics .",
    "we found however that besides this pqcd bifurcation , there exists a second bifurcation by the upper branch @xmath172 couplant , into a third branch or component couplant @xmath18 , at another critical momentum @xmath17 where in all cases , @xmath14 .",
    "the three components or branches @xmath203 are arranged in a chain - like spiral structure .",
    "the @xmath18 in general runs into the original infra - red region @xmath20 but soon rises sharply to very large values in a manner suggestive of a landau pole behavior of the pad couplant at its second bifurcation point .",
    "the extent to which the above pad qcd features and structure can be taken over as those of real physical qcd is a matter for further studies which we are now following up .",
