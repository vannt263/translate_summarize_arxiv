    "roughly speaking , iterated brownian motion ( ibm ) is `` brownian motion run at an independent one - dimensional brownian clock . '' of course , this is not rigorous because the one - dimensional brownian motion can take negative values , whereas brownian motion is defined only for nonnegative times .",
    "there are two natural ways to get around this .",
    "first , one can use the absolute value of the one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "this process is one of the subjects of the papers allouba and zheng ( 2001 ) and allouba ( 2002 ) , where various connections with the biharmonic operator are presented .",
    "those authors call their process `` brownian - time brownian motion '' ( btbm )",
    ". the other rigorous definition of ibm is the one we will use and it is due to burdzy ( 1993 ) .",
    "he uses a natural extension of brownian motion to negative times , called `` two - sided brownian motion . ''",
    "formally , let @xmath0 be independent @xmath1-dimensional brownian motions started at @xmath2 and suppose @xmath3 is one - dimensional brownian motion started at 0 , independent of @xmath4 .",
    "define two - sided brownian motion by @xmath5 then iterated brownian motion is @xmath6    although ibm is not a markov process , it has many properties analogous to those of brownian motion ; we list a few here .    1 .   for instance",
    ", the process scales .",
    "that is , for each @xmath7 , @xmath8 is ibm .",
    "the law of the iterated logarithm holds ( burdzy ( 1993 ) ) @xmath9 there is also a chung  type lil ( khoshnevisan and lewis ( 1996 ) ) and various kesten  type lil s ( csrg , fldes and rvsz ( 1996 ) ) for ibm .",
    "other properties for local times are proved in xiao ( 1998 ) .",
    "the process has @xmath10 order variation ( burdzy ( 1994 ) ) : @xmath11 ^ 4 = 3(t - s ) \\text { in }   l^p,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a partition of @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 .",
    "an interesting interpretation of ibm , due to burdzy and khoshnevisan ( 1998 ) , is as a model for diffusion in a crack .",
    "see deblassie ( 2004 ) for other references .",
    "there is a very interesting connection between ibm ( as well as the btbm process of allouba and zheng ) and the biharmonic operator @xmath15 .",
    "namely , the function @xmath16\\ ] ] solves the cauchy problem @xmath17 ( allouba and zheng ( 2001 ) and deblassie ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "the appearance of the initial function @xmath18 in the pde can be viewed as a manifestation of the non - markovian nature of ibm .",
    "this connection suggests the possibility of a relationship between ibm and initial - boundary or boundary value problems involving the biharmonic operator .",
    "while the results of deblassie ( 2004 ) are not encouraging for connections with initial - boundary value problems , the work of allouba and zheng ( 2001 ) suggests there is some hope for finding connections between probability and dirichlet - type boundary value problems for the bilaplacian .",
    "such a connection , if found , would be particularly exciting in its possible applications to the spectral theory ( the study of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ) of the bilaplacian where very little seems to be known . an important first step in exploring this possibility , as in the case of the laplacian and brownian motion , is to gain an understanding of the structure of the distribution of the exit place of ibm from open sets , what one may call , by abuse of terminology , the `` harmonic measure '' associated with ibm .",
    "in contrast with the btbm process of allouba and zheng , this distribution does not coincide with the usual harmonic measure associated with the laplacian .",
    "the goal of this article is to study the exit distribution of ibm from a cone in @xmath19 .",
    "we chose this domain because it is unbounded and it contains a boundary singularity .",
    "in addition , in this setting we are able to obtain explicit formulas which lead to very sharp results .",
    "our methods are easily adapted to bounded domains but in general our formulas will not be as explicit and the result will not be as sharp .",
    "let @xmath20 be the unit sphere in @xmath19 . if @xmath21 is a proper open subset of @xmath20 , then the _ generalized cone _",
    "@xmath22 generated by @xmath21 is the set of rays emanating from the origin 0 passing through @xmath21 . throughout",
