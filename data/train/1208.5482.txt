    "the fact that the number of substructures seen in cdm simulations greatly outnumber the satellite galaxies detected in the vicinity of the milky way and andromeda constitutes the so - called `` missing satellite problem '' @xcite . while it has been argued that astrophysical processes that quench star formation in low - mass halos may explain this discrepancy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "provided that cdm is in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , these subhalos are in principle detectable by the fermi gamma - ray space telescope because of their annihilation fluxes .",
    "however , fermi has so far failed to detect any unambigious signal from such objects .",
    "gravitational lensing may provide an independent test for the presence of dark halo substructures .",
    "a foreground galaxy that happens to be aligned with a background light source can produce multiple images of the background object , with a typical image separation of @xmath9 ( an effect known as strong lensing or macrolensing ) . while simple , smooth models of galaxy lenses are usually able to reproduce the positions of these macroimages , their observed flux ratios are more difficult to explain .",
    "such flux - ratio violations have been interpreted as evidence of substantial small - scale structure within the main lens .",
    "a notable problem with this picture is that current cdm simulations predict too little substructure to explain many of these flux - ratio violations ( e.g.  but see ) , possibly pointing to a considerable contribution from low - mass halos elsewhere along the line of sight @xcite or some additional form of substructure ( dark or luminous ) within the lens .",
    "a slightly different lensing approach exploits the small - scale distortions that halo substructure is expected to introduce in the morphologies of extended macroimages .",
    "substructures of mass @xmath10 can perturb gravitational arcs and einstein rings on scales resolvable with the _ hubble space telescope _ and detections of @xmath11@xmath12 objects have already been made this way @xcite . in line with the flux ratio anomaly results , these observations seem to suggest a subhalo mass fraction that is significantly higher than predicted by standard cdm , and possibly also a flatter subhalo mass function slope @xcite .    by mapping extended macrolensed sources with milliarcsecond or sub - milliarcsecond resolution using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) techniques at radio wavelengths , substructures at even lower masses can in principle be detected .",
    "such objects may introduce kinks and bends in multiply - imaged quasar jets and one detection of a @xmath13@xmath14 object has already been claimed using this technique @xcite . in this situation , the lensing effects produced by halo substructures can be separated from intrinsic morphological features in jets , since the latter would be reproduced in all macroimages whereas dark matter clumps in the halo of the lens would affect each macroimage differently .",
    "similar methods for exploiting the lensing effects produced by halo substructures on scales of @xmath15 milliarcseconds down to @xmath16 milliarcseconds have also been explored by and @xcite .",
    "however , effects of this type tend to be sensitive to the density profiles of substructures , and may be undetectable for all but the very densest , most extreme forms of substructure @xcite .    here , we use lensing simulations to explore the prospects of using macrolensed quasar jets observed at sub - milliarcsecond resolution , in searches for standard cdm subhalos , ultracompact minihalos and primordial black holes within the main lens .",

    "at @xmath17 , the cdm scenario predicts the existence of dark matter halos with masses ranging from @xmath18 down to the cutoff in the density fluctuation spectrum , which is set by the detailed properties of the cdm particles . for many types of wimps ,",
    "this cut - off lies somewhere in the range @xmath19@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "alternative models involving superweakly - interacting particles ( super - wimps ) , mev mass dark matter or a long - range interaction between dark matter particles may place the cutoff as high as @xmath21@xmath22 @xcite , although the upper end of this range may be in conflict with the apparent masses of the lightest dwarf galaxies ( @xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as these low - mass halos merge to form more massive ones , some temporarily survive in the form of subhalos within the larger halos .",
    "n - body simulations indicate that the subhalos within a galaxy - sized cdm halo should follow a mass function of the type : @xmath24 with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution from subhalos with mass @xmath26 to the dark matter surface mass density at the typical location of macroimages in a galaxy - mass lens is @xmath27 @xcite , albeit with a large scatter @xcite .",
    "the density profiles of isolated field halos in cdm simulations can be reasonably well described by navarro , frenk & white ( @xcite ; hereafter nfw ) profiles : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the characteristic scale radius of the halo .",
    "the slope of the inner density cusp ( @xmath30 ) in this profile is @xmath31 , and this makes it difficult for nfw halos in the dwarf - galaxy mass range to produce millilensing effects of the type we are considering in this paper .",
    "typically , cusp slopes obeying @xmath32 would be required @xcite .",
    "later work has shown that models with inner cusp slopes that become progressively shallower towards the centre provide even better fits to isolated halos in cdm simulations , eventually reaching inner slopes of @xmath33 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the context of detecting millilensing effects from low - mass halos ,",
    "this just makes matters worse , since the central density is reduced .",
    "once a halo falls into the potential well of a larger halo and becomes a subhalo , it is stripped of material ",
    "primarily from its outskirts  due to interactions with its host halo and with other subhalos .",
    "this alters the density profile of the subhalo compared to an isolated halo of the same mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", the chances of detecting millilensing effects from these objects turn out to be negligible in the observational situations we are considering .",
    "to derive the @xmath29 values of our nfw subhalo profiles , we adopt the mass - dependent concentration parameters @xmath34 from either @xcite or @xcite , where @xmath35 is the virial radius of the halo . since both of these recipes predict higher concentration parameters for low - mass halos , and since more centrally concentrated profiles ( i.e. profiles with higher @xmath36 ) are more efficient in producing millilensing effects , we calculate the subhalo concentration parameters based on their current masses rather than the masses they had prior to becoming subhalos .",
    "since nearly all subhalos have lost considerable amounts of material , this also results in overly optimistic millilensing properties .",

    "intermediate - mass black holes that were not produced primordially may instead either form as the end products of very massive population iii stars , through the direct collapse of gas in small halos at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "may over time accrete substantial amounts of dark matter and develop dark matter halos of their own @xcite , similar to the ultracompact minihalos discussed in sect .  [ ucmh_section ] .",
    "imbhs forming through the collapse of pop iii stars in minihalos may also be surrounded by their own , highly contracted dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "such compound objects are expected to have lensing properties intermediate between imbhs and ultracompact minihalos , but are not treated in detail in our simulations .",

    ", we explore to what extent submilliarcsecond observations of macrolensed jets would be able to constrain the properties of ucmhs . because dark matter self - annihilation would reduce the central density of ucmhs , ucmhs made out of self - annihilating wimps would not be efficient millilenses .",
    "we therefore focus on ucmhs made out of non - annihilating dark matter ( e.g. asymmetric dark matter , axions , sterile neutrinos ) .",

    "following matter - radiation equality at @xmath58 , a ucmh born from an initial dark matter overdensity of mass @xmath59 accretes both dark and baryonic matter as @xmath60 this accretion presumably cuts out when the cosmological background is no longer smooth , i.e. when the first substantial structure formation occurs and the smallest star - forming minihalos appear . in this case , present - day ucmh masses and radii can be obtained by setting @xmath61 in eqs .",
    "( [ ucmhprofile ] ) and ( [ ucmhradius ] ) , so that @xmath62    however , the finite temperature of the smooth cosmological background from which ucmhs accrete softens the density profile in the innermost region , due to conservation of angular momentum .",
    "this can be conservatively modelled as a cutoff at some inner radius @xmath63 , inside which one assumes the density to be constant .",

    "to simulate the effects of dark halo substructure on the morphologies of macrolensed jets , we use a numerical scheme similar to that developed by .",

    "the @xmath123 values relevant for @xmath0@xmath3 imbhs and @xmath5@xmath6 ucmhs are listed in table  [ reff ] for the resolutions adopted at 8.4 , 22 and 86 ghz .",
    "since these @xmath123 values also depend on the magnification of the macroimage , @xmath123 values are presented for @xmath124 , 10 ( our default value ) and 30 .",
    "this rescaling scheme , which assumes that the source size and @xmath123 are independent , is admittedly an approximation and reliable only to within a factor of a few .",
    "secondary images due to substructure lensing may for instance be easier to detect for a compact rather than an extended source due to flux ratio issues .",
    "an effect of the latter type is evident in table  [ reff ] , where both @xmath5 imbhs and @xmath125 ucmh are seen to have larger @xmath123 at 86 ghz ( smallest source ) than at 22 ( intermediate source ) or 8.4 ghz ( largest source ) .    ) but with different intrinsic source size : @xmath126 pc ( left ) and @xmath127 pc ( right ) .",
    "the smaller version ( left ) corresponds to the source size adopted for our 22 ghz simulations ( see sect .",
    "[ source size ] ) .",
    "the red dots mark the positions of two @xmath114 imbhs ( identical positions in both frames ) . in the small - source case ( left ) , only one of these imbhs produce detectable millilensing effects , whereas both can be detected in the large - source case ( right ) due to better macroimage coverage of the lens plane .",
    "a resolution of 0.3 milliarcsec has been adopted in both cases ( as considered suitable for 22 ghz observations ) .",
    "[ size_example ] ]          in previous sections , we have assumed the source to be an intrinsically straight jet with a surface brightness distribution described by a 2-dimensional gaussian .",
    "while the intrinsic source morphology and surface brightness profile is less important than the overall source area when assessing lensing probabilities , there are certain situations where they do matter . since gravitational lensing conserves surface brightness , halo substructure can only produce detectable image distortions if it happens to affect a region of the macroimage where there is a non - negligble surface brightness gradient .",
    "in the extreme case of a source with constant surface brightness , halo substructure will not produce _ any _ detectable features unless its lensing effects extends beyond the macroimage boundary .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ sfb ] , where @xmath40 and @xmath3 imbhs ( red dots ) are superposed on macroimages of ( from left to right , for each imbh mass ) an elliptical source with constant surface brightness , an elliptical source with gaussian surface brightness profile and a patchy jet with gaussian  blobs \" of increasing size when moving from the lower - right to upper - left corner .    in this example , a @xmath40 imbh becomes undetectable in the case of a constant surface brightness source , but can be spotted as a mild distortion against the gaussian source .",
    "an imbh of this mass redistributes surface brightness within an area that is much smaller than that of the source .",
    "hence , if the source surface brightness is constant , no detectable effects are produced . even though placed in the exact same position , the lensing produced by a @xmath3 imbh on the other hand extends sufficiently far out to distort the rim of the macroimage and",
    "can therefore be detected regardless of the source profile .",
    "in fact , the only @xmath45 entry in table  [ imbh_limits ] that would change in any dramatic way when going from a gaussian to a constant surface brightness source corresponds to the @xmath40 case depicted in fig .",
    "[ sfb ] ( i.e. source size and resolution corresponding to 8.4 ghz ) . in this case",
    ", constant surface brightness source would effectively prevent any useful @xmath45 constraints , whereas the changes are modest in all other cases . since ucmh lenses produce more long - range effects then imbhs , the @xmath79 estimates in table  [ ucmh_limits ] are even less affected by the source surface brightness profile .",
    "[ sfb ] also provides an example of a more patchy jet morphology .",
    "this jet has the same source area as the other source cases , and consequently extends further in the vertical direction due to the empty regions between the  blobs \" .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath3 imbhs are in principle detectable against the source in this example , although the distortion produced in the former case becomes very modest since the imbh happens to be projected on the outskirts of one of the blobs . in general , having a complicated jet morphology does not significantly compromise the detectability of millilensing effects . instead , a morphology of this type could even boost the detection prospects in cases where the substructure @xmath123 ( see sect .",
    "[ size ] ) is larger than empty regions in the macroimage ( as in the @xmath3 imbh case in fig .",
    "[ sfb ] ) , since the effective source area becomes larger in this situation .",
    "the detection of milliarcsecond or submilliarcsecond - scale image distortions would prove the existence of substructures within the macrolens , and also allow constraints on their surface number densities ( as a function of substructure mass and type ) to be set .",
    "however , the exact nature of a single millilens may still be very difficult to determine , since a low - mass , high - density substructure can produce a distortion very similar to that of a high - mass , low - density object . while have demonstrated that the distortions induced in extended images ( like the ones we model here ) contain some information about the density profiles of the lenses , the finite resolution and sensitivity of actual observations could still allow for considerable degeneracies in cases where neither the masses nor the density profiles of the millilenses are known .",
    "imbhs and ucmhs can for instance produce very similar lensing distortions in our simulations ( although at different masses  a ucmh typically needs to be a factor of @xmath21 more massive than an imbh to reproduce a given feature ) .",
    "while it is possible that a combined consideration of small - scale distortions ( e.g. the bending of a macrolensed jets ) , astrometric perturbations ( the positional shift of a macroimage produced by the presence of substructures ) and macroimage flux ratios could provide some constraints , this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "using simulations of strongly lensed quasar jets , we argue that very dense forms of halo substructure ( intermediate - mass black holes and ultracompact minihalos ) within the main lens may reveal itself through small - scale morphological distortions in the macroimages .",
    "such distortions can be distinguished from intrinsic source features by obtaining data at multiple epochs . by mapping a handful of macrolensed jet systems at submilliarcsecond resolution",
    ", we argue that @xmath21@xmath3 intermediate - mass black holes can be detected or ruled out if they contribute a surface mass fraction of @xmath128 ( depending on the vlbi array and frequency used ) to the dark matter of the main lens at the macroimage positions .",
    "ultracompact minihalos in the @xmath129@xmath6 mass range may similarily produce detectable small - scale effects if such objects comprise @xmath130 of the dark matter . while standard cdm subhalos at masses of @xmath10 can in principle",
    "also produce milliarcsecond - scale distortions , provided that such objects are projected sufficiently close to the macroimages , the probability of this is too small ( @xmath131 ) for sources of the type we consider .",
