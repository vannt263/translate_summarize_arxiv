    "the _ einstein _  observatory performed a survey of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in which two sources with unusually soft spectra , cal83 and  were detected ( long et al .",
    "these sources emit little or no radiation at energies @xmath51  kev and became known as `` super - soft '' sources ( sss ) .",
    "subsequent rosat  observations have revealed approximately 30 similar sources located in the galaxy , the magellanic clouds , a globular cluster and m31 ( see kahabka 1995 ; kahabka & trmper 1996 for recent reviews ) .",
    "sss are hard to detect in the galactic plane due to the effects of interstellar absorption .",
    "absorbed black - body spectral models give typical temperatures of @xmath640  ev and bolometric luminosities of @xmath6@xmath7  .",
    "sss were originally interpreted as due to scattering from an accretion disk corona ( e.g. , smale et al .",
    "1988 ) , or accreting neutron stars radiating near or above the eddington limit ( greiner et al . 1991 ; kylafis & xilouris 1993 ) .",
    "van den heuvel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) proposed that these are systems undergoing steady nuclear burning of hydrogen accreted onto the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ) with masses in the range 0.71.2 m@xmath8 .",
    "the mass transfer from a main - sequence or sub - giant companions is unstable on a thermal time scale and for a narrow range of accretion rates , steady nuclear burning can take place .",
    "evolutionary scenarios for such systems are discussed in rappaport et al .",
    "it is unlikely that sss compose a homogeneous class and one way of probing the nature of individual sources is by searching for the characteristic spectral signatures of nuclear burning on a wd .",
    "this burning takes place deep within the wd atmosphere at a large energy dependent optical depth .",
    "photoelectric absorption by highly ionized metals in the atmosphere can produce edges in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "these effects have been modeled assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) by heise et al .",

    "the optical lightcurve shows a deep asymmetric primary minimum with a shallow , variable , secondary minimum while the x - ray eclipse is narrower and shallow .",
    "the optical modulation may be due to obscuration by a structured accretion disk ( schandl et al .",
    "fitting an absorbed blackbody model to a 37 ksec exposure rosat  position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; 0.12.5  kev ; trmper 1983 )  spectrum gives a best - fit temperature , t , of 35  ev and an equivalent hydrogen column density , , of @xmath10  ( hartmann & heise 1997 ) .  has been a persistent x - ray source since its discovery in 1980 .",
    "the scientific payload of the _ bepposax _  x - ray astronomy satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) comprises four coaligned narrow field instruments , or nfi , including the low energy and medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( lecs and mecs ) .",
    "the lecs is an imaging gas scintillation proportional counter sensitive in the energy range 0.110.0  kev with a circular field of view of 37@xmath11 diameter ( parmar et al .",
    "the background counting rate is @xmath12  arcmin@xmath13  s@xmath14 in the energy range 0.110.0  kev .",
    "the lecs energy resolution is a factor @xmath62.4 better than that of the rosat  pspc , while the effective area is between a factor @xmath66 and 2 lower at 0.28 and 1.5  kev , respectively .",
    "was observed by the lecs as part of the science verification phase between 1996 october 27 02:14 to october 28 23:42  utc . due to the failure of a ground segment link and an instrument anomaly ,",
    "data between october 28 04:54 and 10:55  utc were lost .",
    "good data were selected from intervals when the minimum elevation angle above the earth s limb was @xmath24@xmath15 and when the instrument s settings were nominal using the saxledas 1.4.0 data analysis package .",
    "since the lecs was only operated during satellite night - time , this gave a total on - source exposure of 39  ksec .",
    "the mecs is sensitive in the energy range 1.510  kev , with energy and angular resolutions similar to the lecs ( boella et al .",
    "the mecs observed  for a total exposure of 120  ksec , but did not detect the source .",
    "examination of the lecs image shows a source at a position consistent with ( 32@xmath16 distant ) that of .",
    "a spectrum was extracted centered on the source centroid using a radius of 8@xmath11 .",
    "this radius was chosen to include 95% of the 0.28  kev photons .",
    "the spectrum was rebinned to have @xmath220 counts in each bin to allow the use of the @xmath17 statistic .",
    "the xspec 9.01 package ( arnaud 1996 ) was used for spectral analysis together with the response matrix from the 1996 december 31 release .",
    "background subtraction was performed using a standard blank field with a 46  ksec exposure .",
    "the  count rate above background was @xmath18  s@xmath14 .",
    "examination of the extracted spectrum shows that the source was only detected in a narrow energy range ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : bb_fits ] and  [ fig : model_fits ] ) and only the 17 rebinned channels corresponding to energies between 0.2 and 1.5  kev were used for spectral fitting .      in order to compare the lecs spectrum with those obtained from previous observations , we first fit an absorbed blackbody spectral model to the data ( fig .  [",
    "fig : bb_fits ] ) .",
    "the photoelectric absorption coefficients of morisson & mccammon ( 1983 ) together with the solar abundances of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) were used .",
    "an acceptable fit is obtained with @xmath0  of 1.18 for 14 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ tab : bb_fits ] .",
    "a distance of 50  kpc is assumed in order to derive the wd radius , r , and luminosity , l , and all uncertainties are quoted at 68% confidence .",
    "the spectrum shows evidence for an abrupt cutoff @xmath50.8  kev and so an o  viii edge with absorption depth @xmath19 at a fixed energy of 0.871  kev , was added to the model .",
    "this edge is the dominant spectral feature at energies @xmath50.8  kev in many wd model atmosphere calculations ( e.g.  heise et al .",
    "1994 ; white et al .",
    "1995 ) . including the edge",
    "gives a higher best - fit temperature and improves the fit quality , resulting in a @xmath0  of 0.93 ( table  [ tab : bb_fits ] ) .",
    "the value of the f statistic of 4.76 indicates that the addition of the edge is significant at @xmath295% confidence .",
    "if the edge energy is allowed to vary , then the best - fit value of @xmath20  kev is consistent with an o  viii edge .",
    "heise et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show that optically thick plasmas in the temperature range @xmath21  k are more efficient soft x - ray ( 0.11 kev ) emitters than blackbodies , assuming plane parallel hydrostatic model atmospheres in which lte determines the degree of ionization .",
    "this conclusion has been extended to the nlte case by hartmann & heise ( 1997 ) for both solar and lmc abundances .",
    "these models include free - bound opacity sources for all relevant ions , but are still only first order approximations since line blanketing has not been taken into account .",
    "in addition , close to the eddington limit the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and plane parallel atmospheres are no longer valid .",
    "the above lte and nlte models were fit to the lecs  spectrum .",
    "for the lte case , we assume an lmc abundance of 0.25 times the solar value and a local gravity of @xmath22 , appropriate to wds with mass @xmath23 .",
    "the fit results are however insensitive to abundance and adopting solar abundance gives almost identical results .",
    "models with @xmath24 can not be made hot enough in hydrostatic equilibrium ( due to the eddington limit ) to fit the spectrum .",
    "we note that models with @xmath25 can not be excluded since they can fit the spectrum at higher effective temperatures and lower source radii .    assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index of 2.09 ( i.e. similar to that of the crab nebula ) and a distance of 50  kpc , the 99% confidence upper - limit to any 2.010.0  kev emission from  obtained using mecs data is @xmath26  .",

    "the lecs spectrum of  can be represented by all four types of trial models and it is clear that a lecs spectrum with significantly greater exposure is required to meaningfully discriminate between these models based on fit quality alone .",

    "the relatively large uncertainties in the best - fit parameters means that the luminosity and size of the x - ray emitting region are poorly constrained .",
    "the values of @xmath0  favor the interpretation of the spectrum in terms of a model atmosphere fit with the lte and nlte fits both giving @xmath0  values of 0.76 .",

    "the bolometric luminosity implied by the blackbody interpretation of @xmath2@xmath53   is higher than the eddington luminosity for a @xmath54 object of @xmath55  .",
    "in addition , the required blackbody radius of @xmath2@xmath34  cm is significantly larger than the expected wd radius ( @xmath56  cm for a @xmath57 wd ; nauenberg 1972 ) .",
    "in contrast , the fits using wd atmosphere models imply a lower luminosity , radius and temperature of 2.74.8@xmath3  , 820@xmath58  cm and 5576  ev , respectively .",
    "the wd mass can be constrained assuming that  is on the stability line ( see iben 1992 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "the above temperature range corresponds to a wd of mass @xmath61.2@xmath59 which has a luminosity of 48@xmath60  while undergoing steady nuclear burning ( see also iben & tutukov 1996 ) .",
    "this is at least a factor 8 greater than the luminosity derived above .",
    "since  has an orbital inclination of @xmath2@xmath9 , it is possible that part of the emitting region is obscured , perhaps by the accretion disk . the lecs spectrum of  is therefore consistent with the assumption of a hot wd atmosphere heated by nuclear burning , but formally does not prove such an assumption .    we thank the _ bepposax _  mission director r.c .",
