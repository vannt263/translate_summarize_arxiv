    "quantum turbulence @xcite , which is the disordered motion of a tangle of quantized vortices , has been investigated since pioneering thermal counterflow experiments by vinen in the late 1950s @xcite .",
    "many experimental , theoretical , and numerical studies have advanced our understanding of counterflow turbulence .",
    "many researchers have recently focused on quantum turbulence near 0  k. one of their main motivations is that quantum turbulence at 0  k exhibits some similarities with turbulence in ordinary fluids @xcite .",
    "a typical example is kolmogorov s law , which is the most important statistical law of classical turbulence and which has been numerically confirmed in quantum turbulence too @xcite .",
    "in contrast , turbulence at finite temperatures ( e.g. , counterflow turbulence ) is a form of motion peculiar to two - fluid hydrodynamics @xcite and has no direct analog with turbulence in an ordinary viscous fluid . for this reason , turbulence at finite temperatures",
    "is not currently investigated as much as turbulence at 0 k. however , the physics of finite - temperature turbulence is far from fully understood @xcite .",
    "recently , particle image velocimetry ( piv ) experiments @xcite , which is a technique for visualizing fluid flow using small particles , have been performed to investigate counterflow of superfluid @xmath0he . in order to interpret these experiments , we need to understand the microscopic vortex dynamics in thermal counterflow",
    ". our current understanding of counterflow turbulence is still deficient .",
    "hence , in this introduction we briefly review research of counterflow turbulence and reveal some important unresolved problems .    according to the two - fluid model ,",
    "superfluid @xmath0he consists of an intimate mixture of two fluid components : a viscous normal fluid and an inviscid superfluid .",
    "the density and velocity of the normal fluid are respectively denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , while the superfluid density and velocity are respectively denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the total density , @xmath9 , is approximately temperature independent , but the relative proportions of the normal fluid and the superfluid , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , depends strongly on the temperature . in this system , any rotational motion of a superfluid is sustained only by quantized vortices , which have the quantum circulation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is planck s constant and @xmath14 is the mass of a @xmath0he atom .",
    "a thermal counterflow , which is internal convection produced by a temperature gradient , is explained by this two - fluid model . in a counterflow , entropy and heat",
    "are carried only by the normal fluid component .",
    "hence , if a heat current is applied to the closed end of channel , then the normal fluid will flow from warmer areas to cooler areas while the superfluid will flow in the opposite direction to conserve the total mass . in this way",
    ", counterflow is induced with a relative velocity between the superfluid and the normal fluid of @xmath15",
    ". however , superflow becomes dissipative ( superfluid turbulence ) above a certain critical counterflow velocity .",
    "the concept of superfluid turbulence was introduced by feynman @xcite who stated that the turbulent state consists of a disordered set of quantized vortices , called a vortex tangle .",
    "this idea was further developed by vinen . in order to describe amplification of a temperature difference at the ends of a capillary retaining thermal counterflow , gorter and mellink introduced some additional interactions between the normal fluid and superfluid ( mutual friction ) @xcite . through experimental studies of the second - sound attenuation ,",
    "vinen considered this gorter ",
    "mellink mutual friction in relation to the macroscopic dynamics of the vortex tangle @xcite .",
    "assuming homogeneous superfluid turbulence ( actually , counterflow turbulence is anisotropic ) , vinen obtained an equation for the evolution of the vortex line density ( vld ) @xmath16 , which we call vinen s equation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are temperature - dependent parameters .",
    "the first term represents the energy injection from the normal fluid to the vortices .",
    "the second term denotes the energy dissipation of vortices due to reconnection between vortices .",
    "the first and second terms indicate the growth and the degeneration of a vortex tangle , respectively . therefore , after the growth period of the vld , the vortex tangle enters a statistically steady state . in the steady state ,",
    "the vld is obtained by setting @xmath20 equal to zero , which gives @xmath21 where @xmath4 is a temperature - dependent parameter .",
    "this relation is able to describe well a large number of observations of stationary cases @xcite .    on the other hand , the nonlinear and nonlocal dynamics of vortices",
    "have long delayed progress in achieving a microscopic understanding of quantum turbulence .",
    "it was schwarz who made a breakthrough @xcite .",
    "he investigated counterflow turbulence using the vortex filament model and dynamic scaling @xcite .",
    "the observable quantities obtained by his calculation agree well with the experimental results for the steady state of vortex tangles .",
    "this study confirmed the idea proposed by feynman that superfluid turbulence consists of a quantized vortex tangle .",
    "however , thermal counterflow turbulence is far from being perfectly understood .",
    "the numerical simulation of schwarz has serious defects .",
    "one is that calculations are performed under the localized induction approximation ( lia ) , which neglects interactions between vortices .",
    "schwarz reported that as a result the layer structure is constructed gradually when periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "of course , this behavior differs from experimental observations . in order to remedy this , an unphysical ,",
    "artificial mixing procedure was employed , in which half the vortices are randomly selected to be rotated by 90@xmath22 around the axis defined by the flow velocity .",
    "it is only this method that enables the steady state to be sustained under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "these defects cause us to conjecture that the lia is unsuitable due the absence of interactions between vortices . to understand counterflow turbulence properly , simulations have to be performed using the full biot  savart law without using the artificial mixing procedure .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows .",
    "section ii describes the equations of motion of vortices and the numerical calculation method . in sec .",
    "iii , we show numerical simulations of counterflow turbulence by the full biot  savart law and some physical parameters such as the vld and anisotropy parameters . section iv compares the results obtained using the full biot ",
    "savart law with those obtained using the lia , and shows that the lia is unsuitable .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "a quantized vortex is represented by a filament passing through a fluid and has a definite direction corresponding to its vorticity . except for the thin core region ,",
    "a superflow velocity field has a classically well - defined meaning and can be described by ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "the velocity produced at a point @xmath23 by a filament is given by the biot ",
    "savart expression : @xmath24 the filament is represented in parametric form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 refers to a point on the filament and the integration is performed along the filament .",
    "helmholtz s theorem for a perfect fluid states that the vortex moves with the superfluid velocity at the point . attempting to calculate the velocity @xmath27 at a point @xmath28 on",
    "the filament causes the integral diverge as @xmath29 . to avoid this",
    ", we divide the velocity @xmath30 of the filament at the point * s * into two components : @xcite @xmath31 where the prime denotes derivatives with respect to the arc length @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a cutoff parameter corresponding to the vortex core radius , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the lengths of the two adjacent line elements connected to point @xmath36 .",
    "the first term denotes the localized induction field arising from a curved line element acting on itself .",
    "the second term represents the non - local field obtained by performing the biot ",
    "savart integral along the rest of the filament .",
    "the lia , which has been used in several studies @xcite , involves neglecting the second non - local term in eq .",
    "the equation for the lia is often written as @xmath37 here the coefficient @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant of order unity and @xmath41 is replaced by the characteristic radius @xmath42 of curvature of the vortex lines .",
    "in contrast , calculations without the lia are referred to as full biot  savart calculations .",
    "when counterflow is applied , the applied superfluid velocity @xmath8 is added to @xmath27 , and the total velocity @xmath43 of the vortex filament without dissipation is : @xmath44 at finite temperatures the mutual friction due to the interaction between the vortex core and the normal - fluid flow @xmath6 is taken into account .",
    "the velocity of a point * s * is then given by @xcite @xmath45 , \\label{s}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath46 are the temperature - dependent coefficients , and @xmath43 is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ s0 ] ) . since @xmath46 is small compared with @xmath18 , some authors@xcite neglect @xmath46 . in this study",
    ", we take into account both @xmath46 and @xmath18 . table",
    "[ friction ] presents the mutual fiction parameters used in this study @xcite .",
    ".friction coefficients .",
    "[ friction ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ ani_const](a ) shows the anisotropy as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath47 .",
    "the anisotropy is almost independent of @xmath3 and is dependent on @xmath47 , in agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy ratio @xmath48 has been measured experimentally @xcite and estimated by numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "an isotropic vortex tangle yields @xmath49 . if the vortex tangle consists entirely of curves lying in planes normal to @xmath50 , then @xmath51 .",
    "we show this anisotropy ratio in fig .",
    "[ ani_const](b ) . the anisotropy increases with increasing temperature because the mutual friction increases .",
    "the steady state shows slightly higher values of @xmath48 than those obtained by schwarz .",
    "this is why the vortex interaction reduces the anisotropy , as discussed in sec .",
    "all our numerical results are in reasonable agreement with experimental results .",
    "this means that our model realistically simulates counterflow turbulence .",
    "the steady state was obtained without using an artificial mixing procedure .",
    "previous studies of counterflow turbulence with the lia have encountered some serious difficulties .",
    "schwarz could not obtain the statistically steady state under periodic boundary conditions without using a mixing procedure , as discussed in sec .",
    "i. kondaurova et al . could obtain the steady state using a different reconnection procedure from us , which is discussed in sec .",
    "v. however , their values of @xmath4 were three times larger than experimentally measured values .",
    "these difficulties probably arise from the lia . in this section , we compare two calculations , namely the lia ( figs .",
    "[ t16](a),(c ) ) and the full biot  savart law ( figs .",
    "[ t16](b),(d ) ) .",
    "we run both calculations at the same condition , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath16 and @xmath54 is shown in figs .",
    "[ t16linedensity ] and [ t16anisotropy ] .",
    "the dynamics of vortices by the lia is qualitatively similar to that with the full biot ",
    "savart law in the first and second stages described in sec .",
    "the vortex tangle appears to enter the steady state for @xmath55 .",
    "however , the vld is about twice that for the full biot  savart law , as shown in fig .",
    "[ t16linedensity ] .",
    "this difference is due to the absence of interaction between vortices ; the interaction in general works strongly immediately before and after reconnections . in the case of the full biot  savart calculation , through the mutual friction the interaction between vortices tends to separate two parallel vortices and bring two antiparallel vortices closer to reconnection .",
    "reconnection generally creates sharp cusps@xcite in the vortex lines , so that the vortices separate rapidly with a large self - induced velocity .",
    "however , the lia calculations result in very different reconnection dynamics .",
    "reconnection between parallel vortices occurs frequently in the lia , whereas they occur very little in the full biot",
    " savart calculation due to the interaction .",
    "after reconnection between parallel vortices specific to the lia calculation , the newly created vortices can not separate rapidly because the radius of curvature is large , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ parallel ] , which tends to get the vortices together . also , the resulting vortices are affected little by the decay mechanism described in sec .",
    "consequently , the average distance of the lia is smaller and the vld is larger than those of the full biot  savart calculation .",
    "the expansion by mutual friction tends to straighten vortices perpendicularly to @xmath50 , but reconnection suppresses this tendency by creating a low radius of curvature .",
    "however , as discussed above , in the lia calculations , parallel vortices tend to come together due to the absence of interaction ; hence , vortices can not create a small radius of curvature , which gradually straighten and align vortices .",
    "vortices eventually commence forming a bundle structure composed of parallel straight vortices , as shown in figs .",
    "[ t16](a ) and ( c ) , which is bunches of straight vortices , not turbulence . in this state ,",
    "the vorticity directions of the vortex bundles differ from one layer to another , as shown in fig .",
    "[ direction ] .",
    "the lia calculation gives very different vortex properties from the full biot ",
    "savart calculation .",
    "we can thus conclude that the lia is unsuitable for simulating counterflow turbulence .",
    "the interaction between vortices plays an important role in making turbulence uniform .",
    "it probably applies to any kind of quantum turbulence .",
    "in this study , we investigated thermal counterflow turbulence using the vortex filament model . the full biot  savart law was used in our calculation , unlike previous studies by schwarz @xcite .",
    "we obtain the statistically steady state without using the mixing procedure that schwarz used to sustain the steady state .",
    "our numerical results reveal the characteristic relation @xmath1 , which has been observed in many experiments , and the parameter @xmath4 agrees with experimentally measured values .",
    "also , the anisotropy parameters are in reasonable agreement with experimental observations .    to investigate the validity of the lia , we compared the lia with the full biot  savart calculation .",
    "kondaurova et al .",
    "mention that the reason why schwarz encountered difficulties is due to the reconnection procedure ; they obtained the steady state using the lia and a different reconnection procedure from us and schwarz @xcite .",
    "they assume that reconnections occur only when the vortices are expected to cross each other .",
    "probably the details of the reconnection procedure are not relevant to statistical quantities such as the vld and the anisotropy parameters .",
    "kondaurova et al .",
    "encountered another difficulty in that the value of the parameter @xmath4 is very large . our comparison between the lia and the full biot ",
    "savart reveal that the difficulties encountered by schwarz and kondaurova et al .",
    "originate from the lia .",
    "the steady state of turbulence can not be sustained in lia calculations because most vortices gradually straighten and lie in the planes normal to @xmath3 . since the full biot ",
    "savart calculation includes the interaction between vortices , our findings imply that the interaction between vortices is essential for turbulence simulations .",
    "paoletti et al . succeeded in visualizing counterflow using solid hydrogen particles@xcite , and they obtained a bimodal distribution for the particle velocity .",
    "paoletti et al .",
    "expect that particles dragged by the normal fluid and particles trapped in the vortex tangle contribute to this bimodality , but this still remains to be confirmed .",
    "further study is required to understand this observation .",
