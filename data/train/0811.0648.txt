    "since the discoveries of @xmath4 and @xmath5 more than thirty years ago , a great deal of information on heavy quarkonium levels and their transitions has been accumulated @xcite .",
    "on one hand , the known levels of charmonium and bottomonium include @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath1 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 states , with the labels @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 corresponding to relative orbital angular momentum @xmath15 = 0 , 1 , 2 between quark and antiquark . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerous transitions between heavy quarkonium states are classified into strong and radiative decays , which shed light on aspects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in both the perturbative and the non - perturbative regimes ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "recently the more precise @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 mass measurements have been reported @xcite , and the errors of their relevant decay widths have decreased @xcite . a thorough understanding of their properties , such as their quark distribution amplitudes , which are the universal non - perturbative objects , will be of great benefit when analyzing the hard exclusive processes with heavy quarkonium production .",
    "it has been known that heavy quarkonium is relevant for a non - relativistic treatment @xcite .",
    "although non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) is a powerful theoretical tool for separating the high energy modes from low energy contributions , in most cases the calculation of low energy hadronic matrix elements has relied on model - dependent non - perturbative methods . therefore , various methods have been employed in heavy quarkonium physics , such as lattice qcd , quark - potential model , etc . @xcite .",
    "the light - front quark model offers many insights into the internal structures of the bound states . in this study ,",
    "heavy quarkonium is explored within a quark model on the light front .",
    "light - front qcd is a promising analytic method for solving the non - perturbative problems of hadron physics @xcite , and may be the only possible method by which the low energy quark model and the high energy parton model can be reconciled . for hard processes with a large momentum transfer , light - front qcd reduces to perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) which factorizes the physical quantity into a convolution of the hard scattering kernel and the quark distribution amplitudes .",
    "the basic ingredient in light - front qcd is the relativistic hadron wave function .",
    "it generalizes the distribution amplitudes by including the transverse momentum distributions , and it contains all the information of a hadron from its constituents .",
    "the hadronic quantities are represented by the overlap of wave functions and can be derived in principle .",
    "the light - front wave function is manifestly a lorentz invariant as it is expressed in terms of the internal momentum fraction variables which are independent of the total hadron momentum .",
    "moreover , the fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and the center - of - mass motion can be carried out using the so - called melosh rotation @xcite .",
    "this treatment has been successfully applied to calculate many phenomenologically important meson decay constants and hadronic form factors @xcite .",
    "in addition , the covariant light - front approach @xcite has also been applied to ground - state @xmath19-wave mesons , which include @xmath20 pseudoscalar mesons @xmath21 and @xmath22 vector mesons @xmath23 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the quark distribution amplitude or light - cone wave function ( lcwf ) absorbs the non - perturbative dynamics and is the key ingredient of any hard exclusive process with hadron production . in the literature , there are many theoretical studies @xcite of this issue .",
    "the main purpose of this study is the calculation of the quark distribution amplitudes of pseudoscalar and vector heavy quarkonium states by integrating the transverse momenta of momentum distribution amplitudes within the light - front approach .",
    "as to the so - called @xmath3-moments which parameterize the quark distribution amplitudes , they are also calculated analytically .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii comprises brief reviews of the light - front framework and the light - front analysis for the decay constants of pseudoscalar ( @xmath13 ) and vector ( @xmath24 ) mesons ; the processes @xmath25 are given . in section iii , the quark distribution amplitudes and the @xmath3-moments are calculated . in section iv , the numerical results and discussions are presented .",
    "finally , the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "in heavy quarkonium , the valence quarks have equal masses , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the mass of heavy quark @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",

    "the momentum of a particle is given in terms of the light - front component by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the light - front vector is written as @xmath33 .",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath34 is restricted to positive values , i.e. , @xmath35 for the massive particle . in this way , the physical vacuum of light - front qcd is trivial except for the zero longitudinal momentum modes ( zero - mode ) .",
    "a meson with total momentum @xmath13 and two constituents , quark and anti - quark whose momenta are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively will be studied . in order to describe the internal motion of the constituents , it is crucial to introduce the intrinsic variables @xmath38 through & & p_1^+=x p^+ ,   p_1=x p_+ p _ ; + & & p_2^+=(1-x ) p^+ ,   p_2=(1-x ) p_- p _ , where @xmath39 is the light - front momentum fraction .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath40 of the constituents and the relative momentum in @xmath41 direction @xmath42 can be written as [ eq : mpz ] m_0 ^ 2= ,   p_z=(x-)m_0 .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath40 of @xmath43 is generally different from the mass @xmath44 of meson which satisfies @xmath45 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the meson , quark and anti - quark can not be on - shell simultaneously .",
    "the momenta @xmath46 and @xmath42 constitute a momentum vector @xmath47 , which represents the relative momenta in the transverse and @xmath41 directions , respectively .",

    "@xcite , one can pass to the light - front approach by integrating the @xmath49 component of the internal momentum in the covariant feynman momentum loop integrals .",
    "the feynman rules for the meson - quark - anti - quark vertices were then needed to calculate the amplitudes which related to the decay constant and m1 transition . in the following formulations ,",
