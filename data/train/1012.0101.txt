    "zirconia ( zro@xmath0 ) is a highly attractive material of great interests both scientifically and in terms of its technological applications due to its excellent mechanical , thermal , chemical , and dielectric properties fadda1 .",
    "for example , zro@xmath0 is employed as superplastic structural ceramic that demonstrates superb strength and fracture toughness garvie , and is also used as one of the best refractive engineering materials for thermal barrier coating on aeronautical and land - based gas turbine blades @xcite .",
    "additionally , the cation - doped zro@xmath0 can also be used in solid oxide fuel cells and oxygen sensors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as one of the most radiation resistant ceramic materials , zro@xmath1 is applied as a promising candidate host phase for the inert matrix nuclear fuel ( imf ) in order to immobilize @xcite and burn up gong the plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and other high level nuclear waste ( hlw ) caused by the actinides ( e.g. @xmath2am ) .",
    "consequently , great attentions are needed to focus on the basic scientific research of zro@xmath1 .",
    "zro@xmath0 exists at least five crystalline structures with different symmetries .",
    "the monoclinic _ p2@xmath3/c _",
    "polymorph is the only one found at ambient condition whereas the tetragonal _",
    "p4@xmath0/nmc _ and the cubic _",
    "m _ phases are stable above 1400 and 2600 k and the other two orthorhombic _ pbca _ and _ pnma _ phases are stable above 3 and 20 gpa , respectively @xcite .",
    "as these five zro@xmath0 structures are centrosymmetric , they are all nonpolar and nonpiezoelectric . presently , zro@xmath0 stabilized in the cubic phase with e.g. y@xmath0o@xmath5 is considered as a suitable refractory host for actinide confinement used for transmutation or high - temperature reactor projects .",
    "large amounts of experimental measurements have been carried out to determine the stability of this material in high radiation environment .",
    "one early investigation on phase stability of zro@xmath0 under fission fragment damage was reported by wittels and sherrill @xcite .",
    "then the evolution of radiation induced damages in zro@xmath0 @xcite was systematically investigated using rutherford backscattering spectrometry and ion channeling ( rbs / c ) , along with x - ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) under xe and i ion irradiation .",
    "no amorphization of the pure zro@xmath0 was observed .",
    "but meldrum _ et al_. @xcite found that nanocrystalline zro@xmath0 could be amorphized under ne and xe ion irradiation .",
    "damage evolution , surface morphology and characteristic structural changes in he - implanted cubic zro@xmath0 were extensively investigated in experiments @xcite .",
    "fluence dependence and thermal stability of defects in he - implanted cubic zro@xmath0 was determined by slow positron implantation spectroscopy @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the he damage and he effusion in fully stabilized zro@xmath0 @xcite was measured with neutron depth profiling ( ndp ) for different annealing temperatures and analyzed by electron microscopy during the various annealing stages concluding that the diffusion of he is probably caused by vacancy assisted interstitial diffusion .",
    "besides , he migration in monoclinic and cubic yttria - stabilized zro@xmath0 was also studied from non - destructive @xmath6he depth profiling using the resonant @xmath6he(d , p)@xmath7he nuclear reaction @xcite .    from theoretical point of view , _ ab initio _ methods have been employed to study the structural , electronic , mechanical , thermodynamical , and vibrational properties of zro@xmath0 fadda1,jansen , orlando , french , jomard , lowther , dewhurst , dash , jaffe , sternik , kuwabara , fadda2 .",
    "very recently , the energetics of intrinsic point defects and the influence of al doping in zro@xmath0 @xcite have been studied to identify the dominant defects under different oxygen chemical potentials and fermi levels . however , up to date there are no detailed investigation performed on the he incorporation and diffusion behavior in zro@xmath0 through a state - of - the - art first - principles approach . to make a deep understanding of the effect of he in zro@xmath0 in atomic scale is helpful for us to be more confident to validate the application of zro@xmath0 in severe environment .",
    "therefore , this is the main purpose of the present work . in the present study ,",
    "first the behavior of he in cubic zro@xmath0 is investigated by determining the formation energy of point defects .",
    "then the incorporation energy of he into different sites of the lattice is calculated , through which the most favorable incorporation site is determined . by taking thermodynamic equilibrium into account , the solubility of he is also evaluated .",
    "after exploration of the stability of he , we subsequently concentrate on the diffusion mechanism of he in zro@xmath0 by calculating energy barriers and migration pathways between two trapping sites .",
    "after comparison of calculated results for different postulated mechanisms , we present the viable diffusion mechanism of he in zro@xmath0 matrix .",
    "the density functional theory ( dft ) total energy calculations are self - consistently performed in the framework of the frozen core all - electron paw method @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the electron exchange and correlation potentials are evaluated within the gga introduced by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite .",
    "twelve electrons ( 4s@xmath84p@xmath94d@xmath85s@xmath8 ) for zirconium ( zr ) and six electrons ( 2s@xmath82p@xmath7 ) for oxygen ( o ) are taken into account as valence electrons . to get accurate results ,",
    "the cutoff energy of the plane wave expansion is set up to a high value of 800 ev , which was tested to be well converged with respect to the total energy .",
    "the integration over the brillouin zone ( bz ) is performed with a grid of special _",
    "k _ point - mesh determined according to the monkhorst - pack scheme monkhorst . after convergence test , 8@xmath108@xmath108 _ k _ point - mesh is chosen to calculate the bulk properties with the total energy difference less than 1 mev per unit cell . in the present work ,",
    "large supercells containing up to 96 atoms have been employed to reduce any artificial error due to the use of a smaller supercell as it will be shown later .",
    "correspondingly , a 2@xmath102@xmath102 _ k_-point grid is used to sample the bz of the 96-atom supercell for the modeling of the point defects and he impurity in zro@xmath0 .",
    "relaxation procedures at ground state are carried out according to the gaussian broadening with a smearing width of 0.1 ev .",
    "for all defect structures , the atomic relaxation is considered to be completed when the hellmann - feynman forces on all atoms are less than 0.01 ev /  . and",
    "the volume relaxation of the supercell is also calculated .",
    "o atoms are located at the corners of small cubes , and zr atoms are located at the center of an alternative cubes .",
    "@xmath10 indicates the octahedral interstitial site ( ois ) in the lattice.,width=226 ]    here , we considered the cubic phase of zro@xmath0 , which is crystallized in the fluorite structure with space group _ fm@xmath4 m _ ( no .",
    "the zr atoms are in the center of a cube of o atoms , while the o atoms occupy the tetrahedral sites coordinated by zr atoms , constituting a simple cubic sublattice as shown in fig .",
    "the present optimized equilibrium lattice parameter ( _ a _ ) obtained by fitting the energy - volume data in the third - order birch - murnaghan equation of states ( eos ) @xcite is 5.152   and some other basic bulk properties calculated with this paw method is also listed in table 1 , in fair agreement with the experimental and previous theoretical results .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the calculated incorporation energies at any trap site are positive indicating that they are less stable in zro@xmath0 fluorite lattice than in the free gas phase .",
    "this means that some energy has to be provided to incorporate he in zro@xmath0 .",
    "the minimum incorporation energy is found for the zr vacancy . with relatively high incorporation energies of he at ois and o vacancy",
    ", we expect a slight preference for he to be located at zr vacancy . however , the large solution energies at various sites ( see table 3 ) lead to the prediction of the insolubility of he in cubic zro@xmath1",
    ". we can conclude that the driving force for the experimentally observed he release has its origin in this insolubility .",
    "the results shows that he is more likely to be accommodated at the ois for the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration . as for the perturbation of the crystal induced by the impurity",
    ", it is revealed that the volume relaxation with the incorporated he has no great influence on the incorporation energies and the he impurity only induces a slight expansion of the lattice parameter .",
    "finally , bader analysis results show that the he impurity displays only a weak charge transfer , in agreement with a complete electronic shell and neutral environment at this position .",
    "this finding also explains why a zr vacancy is the most favorable incorporation site for he since it is well known @xcite that a he atom prefers to occupy the site with the low electron density due to its filled - shell electronic configuration .",
    "the concentration of he remaining in the lattice is decided not only by the solution energies but also by the ease with which the he atom can diffuse out of the lattice . here , we take considerations into the possible diffusion mechanisms for one he atom .",
    "the climbing image nudged elastic band ( cineb ) method @xcite is employed to find the minimum energy path ( mep ) of atomic migration when both the initial and final configurations are known .",
    "the cineb is an efficient and improved method for finding the energy saddle point between the given initial and final states of a transition to understand the energy path of he diffusion behavior .",
    "migration energy barrier is defined as the energy difference between an initial configuration and the saddle point . the interstitial and vacancy assisted diffusion mechanisms of one he atom in zro@xmath0 are systematically studied as follows .",
    "we first investigate the interstitial diffusion mechanism of he in defect - free zro@xmath0 by calculating the migration energy between two adjacent ois sites , which are the body - centered position of the lattice .",
    "the diffusion pathway and mep are shown in fig .",
    "we perform the cineb calculation in which the initial guess for the atomic positions of the diffusing he atom is simply a linear interpolation between the ois sites .",
    "the saddle point obtained with this initial guess is found to be in the middle of the migration pathway as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , corresponding to an energy barrier of 3.74 ev . in the panel of fig .",
    "3(b ) , we can see obviously the distortion of the nearest two o atoms at the saddle point , which are pushed away from their lattice sites by about 0.37   in the perpendicular direction to the migration pathway of he by the strain energy .",
    ".,width=226 ]      next , we explore the migration pathways of he in a defective zro@xmath0 and find that the energy barriers are remarkably decreased compared to the previous results .",
    "we take zr and o vacancy into account separately to probe into the minor difference of the vacancy assisted diffusion mechanism . in the case of zr vacancy preexisting ,",
    "three possible migration pathways are assumed and cineb calculations are carried out similarly .",
    "the first postulated mechanism is involved in the direct diffusion of he from ois into the nearest ois in the presence of zr vacancy , shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) . examining the mep for this mechanism in fig .",
    "4(b ) , two images on either side of the saddle point configuration exhibit a slight oscillation in energies around the transition state .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation is only 0.02 ev , which is within the error of the calculations .",
    "the reliable estimate of the energy barrier can be obtained as about 0.23 ev , which must be overcome in the direct diffusion path of he from ois to ois .",
    "we find that the zr vacancy is a trap for he atom from the mep . along the diffusion pathway",
    ", he atom moves into the zr vacancy during the atomic relaxation at the third image , and an additional energy of about 1.36 ev must be provided when the he migrates back into the nearest ois as shown in fig .",
    "the distortion of the nearest o atoms of he is calculated . due to the strain energy of he ,",
    "the displacement of o atom in the perpendicular direction to the pathway is about 0.43   at the saddle point .",
    ".,width=226 ]    the second kind of diffusion is assumed that he hops through a zr vacancy from one ois to the next nearest ois .",
    "in addition , the two adjacent ois lies in the line with zr vacancy , represented in fig .",
    "it is interestingly noted that the mep in fig .",
    "5(b ) displays the same migration energy trend as the first one in fig .",
    "the energy barrier is 0.23 ev for migration from ois to the nearest ois , and once the he atom diffuses into the zr vacancy , it hardly moves into the next ois unless an extra energy of 1.36 ev is gained .",
    "the next nearest o atom has the largest distortion 0.48   when he is trapped in the zr vacancy .",
    ".,width=226 ]    the third possible diffusion path is similar with the second assumption , but the two nearest ois is not in the line with zr vacancy , as illustrated in fig .",
    "we consider the cineb calculation of this migration in two steps .",
    "the mep in fig .",
    "6(b ) shows the step that the he atom first jumps into the zr vacancy from the ois , and fig .",
    "6(c ) gives the situation that he atom migrates into the nearest ois from zr vacancy . from initial ois to zr vacancy , the saddle point is obtained with an energy barrier of 0.23 ev , and when he diffuses from zr vacancy to final ois , another saddle point appears with a larger migration barrier of 0.91 ev .",
    "similarly , in this case the distortion of the nearest o atoms of he at zr vacancy is as small as only 0.10  .    from above analysis",
    ", it is concluded that in zro@xmath0 , as zr vacancy preexists , he diffuses easily with a lower migration energy barrier than the interstitial diffusion mechanism .",
    "different diffusion pathways proposed here demonstrate a similar migration characteristic .",
    "obviously , it is more likely to trap the he atom into the zr vacancy along the diffusion pathway when compared to the defect - free cases .",
    "as for o vacancy that preexists in zro@xmath0 , similar consideration is taken to evaluate the diffusion mechanism of he atom . at first , we discuss that he atom directly migrates from ois into the nearest ois , given in fig .",
    "then he atom hopping from ois to nearest ois through o vacancy is investigated .",
    "it is considered that the he atom first moves into the o vacancy from the ois , and next the he atom is assumed to jump into the nearest ois from the o vacancy , shown in fig .",
    "the mep of direct migration from ois to the nearest ois in the presence of o vacancy is different from the migration with the preexisting zr vacancy discussed above , as shown in fig .",
    "there are two images in fig .",
    "7(b ) that are predicted to be most energetically favorable . in the middle point of the pathway",
    ", the metastable state is found between the two local saddle points . at the middle image of this pathway",
    ", the he atom is trapped into the o vacancy after the relaxation during cineb calculation . the energy barrier from the energy favorable site to the saddle point",
    "is 2.18 ev .",
    "on the other hand , the mep of he atom hopping from ois to nearest ois through o vacancy is illustrated separately in fig .",
    "8(b ) and fig .",
    "the saddle point is obtained in the pathway with the energy barrier 1.04 ev and 0.92 ev , corresponding the migration energy barrier from the initial ois to o vacancy and from o vacancy to the final ois , respectively . at various images in the cineb calculation ,",
    "the o atoms near the o vacancy move inward to the vacancy at about 0.25 .",
    ".,width=226 ]        from the above discussion , we find that the migration barrier of interstitial diffusion is relatively higher than the vacancy assisted diffusion . during the migration of he with",
    "zr or o vacancy preexisted , the he atom is easily trapped into the vacancy and an extra energy of only about 1 ev is needed to hop out of the vacancy , which remarkably agrees well with the experimental result @xcite .",
    "therefore , the diffusion behavior of he atom in cubic zro@xmath0 is dominated by the vacancy assisted diffusion mechanisms .",
    "in summary , we have performed total - energy calculations to investigate the formation energies of native point defects , the he incorporation and solution energies , and the diffusion properties of he in cubic zro@xmath0 , using the paw - gga method and supercell approach .",
    "our calculated results of incorporation energies have suggested that trapping of a he atom at a zr vacancy is more stable than at a o vacancy or at an ois . from the solution energy results , on the other hand",
    ", it has been found that the he is more likely to be located at the ois for the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration . to get more insights into the diffusion mechanism of he ,",
    "we have calculated the migration energy of he in various pathways through the cineb calculation , from which it has been shown once the he is trapped by the vacancy , its migration energy barrier from the vacancy to the nearest ois is largely decreased when compared to the vacancy - free case .",
    "thus , we conclude the diffusion of he in zro@xmath0 is mainly assisted by the vacancy , which is expected to provide a guiding line in explaining the experimentally observed he diffusion phenomenon .",
