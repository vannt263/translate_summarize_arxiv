    "the coupling between carriers and phonons is known or believed to be important for many materials , including cuprates,@xcite manganites , @xcite , nickelates @xcite and bismuth perovskites.@xcite these materials display a variety of interesting phenomena , including , but not limited to , high - temperature superconductivity ( cuprates , babio@xmath2 ) , layered ferromagnetism ( manganites ) and a spin / charge density wave ( nickelates ) .",
    "the carrier - phonon coupling leads to the formation of a polaron , a coherent quasi - particle ( qp ) consisting of the charge carrier and the cloud of phonons surrounding it and moving coherently with it .",
    "polarons have been studied extensively especially in the holstein model , @xcite the simplest model where local phonons modify the on - site energy of the carrier , but also to generalizations with short - range and long - range couplings of similar origin , such as the breathing - mode ( bm ) model @xcite , the double - well potential model@xcite and the frhlich model @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is that the coupling to phonons modulates the carrier s hopping integrals , a scenario described by the ssh model , @xcite which has seen an increased amount of interest in recent years.@xcite this is because the ssh model exhibits a sharp transition in the properties of its polaron , one signature being the change of the polaron ground state ( gs ) momentum from @xmath1 ( at weak coupling ) to a finite value that smoothly evolves toward @xmath3 ( at strong coupling ) .",
    "such transitions were shown to be impossible for models where the phonons modulate the on - site energy @xcite.a study of a model which includes both types of carrier - phonon coupling was carried out by herrera _ et . al _ @xcite and found that in addition to the transition observed in the ssh model , a second transition of the gs momentum also takes place . whether other such transitions can occur and what are their characteristics , is currently an open question .",
    "efforts to understand polaron physics have , so far , focused almost exclusively on single - band models .",
    "it is therefore a natural question to ask whether the polaron properties of multi - band models are similar , or whether they are qualitatively different from those of single band models . in this article",
    ", we answer this question based on a study of the single polaron properties of the two - band model depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : model ] , with two different atoms per unit cell , one of which is light and thus supports lattice vibrations ( optical phonons ) .",
    "the coupling to this phonon mode modulates the hopping integrals , in direct analogy with the one - band ssh model.(for the vanishing carrier concentration of interest to us , the ssh - model is a one - band model because the peierls dimerization only occurs at half - filling @xcite ) .",
    "due to a phonon on site @xmath4 is also shown . ]",
    "given this similarity , one may expect our two - band model to behave like the ssh model , and indeed we find a sharp transition at strong carrier - hole coupling , where the polaron gs momentum changes its value .",
    "however , unlike in the one - band ssh model where the gs momentum changes continuously with coupling , in our model the gs momentum jumps discontinuously from @xmath5 to @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , this transition leads to an extreme flattening of the polaron band , unlike in the ssh model .",
    "we conclude that this transition is qualitatively different from that of the one - band ssh model .",
    "we argue that the mechanism for the transition is a competition between the bare carrier hopping which favors a gs momentum @xmath5 , and the phonon - modulated hopping which favors @xmath1 . while some of this physics is similar to that explaining the transition in the ssh model , we find strong indications that the two - band nature of our model plays a vital role .",
    "this makes it unlikely that such a discontinuous transition can occur in a one - band model .",
    "the physics described in this article is therefore , to our knowledge , fundamentally new and our findings hint at the possibility that there is still more , new polaron physics to be discovered in other multi - band models .",
    "the physical inspiration for our model is the perovskite babio@xmath2 , which is known to have strong electron - phonon coupling and to exhibit superconductivity up to surprisingly high temperatures upon hole doping ( @xmath6 in the case of ba@xmath7k@xmath8bio@xmath2 @xcite and @xmath9 for bapb@xmath7bi@xmath10o@xmath2 ) @xcite , widely believed to be due to a phononic glue @xcite .",
    "the relevant valence orbitals are the bi 6@xmath11 orbitals and the o 2@xmath12 orbitals .",
    "previous work on polarons and bipolarons in this material was carried out by allen _",
    "_ @xcite and is based on the rice - sneddon model @xcite which assumes that the bi atoms undergo charge disproportionation , bi@xmath13bi@xmath14bi@xmath15bi@xmath16 . this scenario has received wide - spread attention @xcite , and as a consequence many model hamiltonians only take into account the bi 6@xmath11 orbitals .",
    "polaronic signatures in agreement with this work have also been found experimentally @xcite .",
    "a different scenario is provided by a recent study of foyevtsova _ et .",
    "_ @xcite and the experimental as well as theoretical work of menushenkov _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "_ argue that the bio@xmath17 octahedra undergo a breathing distortion due to strong hybridization between the bi 6@xmath11 and o 2@xmath12 orbitals , with the holes being located primarily on the o. this picture is similar to that proposed recently for the nickelates @xcite and the inspiration for our `` toy model '' . in this picture",
    "both the bi 6@xmath11 and o 2@xmath12 orbitals need to be taken into account . since o atoms are much lighter than bi atoms , only optical phonons on the o atoms are considered and are allowed to modulate the hopping integrals .    when compared to other perovskites such as the cuprates , manganites and nickelates , babio@xmath2 is appealing because of its comparatively simple electronic structure and absence of magnetic properties . to simplify things even more , instead of considering a model describing such a material at or near half filling ,",
    "as it is in reality , we investigate the single polaron physics in its almost fully compensated case , _",
    "i.e. _ like in labio@xmath2 with one extra hole .",
    "generalizing to one carrier ( polaron ) per unit cell will be left for future work . moreover , as indicated above , we restrict ourselves to study a 1d bio - like chain , instead of treating the full 3d system .",
    "there are two practical reasons for these simplifications : ( i ) they make comparison to the ssh model , where polaron results are currently available only for the 1d model , possible ; ( ii ) they allow us to use exact diagonalization ( ed ) to find essentially exact results very efficiently,@xcite which in turn also allows us to probe a wide range of coupling strengths and phonon frequencies to understand the relevant physics .    beside using ed to understand the polaron properties of this model",
    ", we also develop and validate here two simple versions of the variational momentum average ( ma ) approximation,@xcite which capture the relevant polaronic physics qualitatively and even quantitatively .",
    "ma approaches are very useful because their accuracy improves in higher dimensions while maintaining similar computational efficiency .",
    "this is in contrast to ed and most other numerical methods that become very costly due to the significant increase of the hilbert space in higher dimensions .",
    "this work can therefore be seen as a first step towards a study of the 3d systems .",
    "note that apart from their usefulness in treating more complex problems , developing such approximations also leads to a better understanding of the nature of the polaron s cloud .",
    "to summarize , the research presented in this article serves two main purposes : ( i ) to reveal surprising , new polaron physics whose nature appears to be tied to the two - band nature of our model , and ( ii ) to serve as a test - ground for approximations which will be useful in solving the 3d many - band problem , and thus help to improve our understanding of the fascinating compound babio@xmath2 , if the scenario of foyevtsova _ et",
    "_ turns out to be valid , or of other many - band materials with hopping - modulated carrier - phonon coupling .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model and in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] we introduce the ed algorithm , ma and a perturbation theory .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we study the single polaron properties of the 1d , two - band model sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "there are two atoms per unit cell , one hosting valence electrons in an @xmath11-orbital , and the other in a @xmath12-orbital .",
    "the latter atom is assumed to be sufficiently light so that it is a good approximation to ignore the motion of the heavier ones . in other words , we assume that the lighter atoms oscillate inside the `` cage '' made of heavier atoms , giving rise to an optical phonon mode that modulates the @xmath11-@xmath12 hopping of the carriers .",
    "we consider the limit of a very lightly doped insulator , _",
    "i.e. _ all states are filled except for a single hole present on the chain . the inspiration to study such a model",
    "was discussed in the previous section .",
    "the kinetic energy of the hole is described by a nearest neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian : @xmath18 here @xmath19 creates a hole on the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) orbital of the atoms in the @xmath20 unit cell ( the spin is an irrelevant degree of freedom here , and we do not write it explicitly ) .",
    "their fourier transforms are : @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the location of the unit cell @xmath24 , and the number of unit cells @xmath25 .",
    "the momentum @xmath26 is restricted to the first brillouin zone ( bz ) , @xmath27 .    for an undistorted chain ( no phonons ) , and keeping in mind that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are hole operators , for the choice of lobe orientation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] we have @xmath30 , leading to the kinetic energy : @xmath31 the @xmath32 hopping parameter is given by the overlap of the @xmath11 and @xmath12-orbitals when the atoms are in their equilibrium positions .",
    "changing its sign corresponds to changing the sign convention for the @xmath12-orbitals , and therefore does not have any physical effect . as a consequence ,",
    "the results we present below for a hole - doped chain remain identical for an electron - doped chain as well . when phonons are excited , the hopping amplitudes change from this equilibrium value , resulting in the hole - phonon coupling term discussed below .    the hole s on - site energy depends on whether it sits on an @xmath11- or a @xmath12-orbital and leads to a charge transfer term : @xmath33 the difference in on - site energies can have either sign , favoring the @xmath12 ( if @xmath34 ) or @xmath11 ( if @xmath35 ) orbitals . the on - site energy for the @xmath11 orbitals",
    "is set to zero .",
    "the phonons are assumed to be described by a dispersionless einstein mode with energy @xmath36 ( we set @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 creates a phonon on the @xmath12-orbital of the lighter atom of the @xmath20 unit cell .",
    "as discussed , the heavier atoms are taken to be frozen in their equilibrium positions .",
    "this model allows for two types of hole - lattice coupling .",
    "one comes from the modulation of on - site energies , because when the distance between neighbor atoms changes , so do the corresponding coulomb interactions .",
    "we are not aware of a comprehensive study of this type of coupling for this two - band model , although the asymptotic cases with @xmath40 ( the breathing - mode model @xcite ) and @xmath41 ( the double - well model@xcite ) have been studied and have revealed interesting polaronic behavior , although still rather conventional .    instead , we focus here on the hole - lattice coupling arising from the fact that changes in the distance between adjacent atoms also modulate the hopping integrals .",
    "as we show below , this modulation of the kinetic energy leads to qualitatively new physics of a kind that , so far as we know , has not been revealed before .",
    "thus , the hole - phonon coupling that we study arises from the linear expansion of the hopping amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a function of the small oxygen displacement @xmath44 .",
    "if we choose coordinates such that @xmath45 for a displacement toward the left , to linear order this expansion gives : @xmath46 = t[1+\\tilde{\\alpha } ( b_i +      b_i^\\dagger ) ] \\\\ & t_{i , i-1 } \\approx -t[1-\\alpha x_{i-1 } ]   = -t[1-\\tilde{\\alpha } ( b_{i-1 } + b_{i-1}^\\dagger)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] within this approximation @xmath47 , where after absorbing all the constants into the coupling @xmath48 , we find : @xmath49\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose @xmath50 . note that because the sign of @xmath48 is controlled by the choice of the coordinate system , a change @xmath51 is equivalent with choosing @xmath45 for displacements toward the right .",
    "consequently the polaron properties only depend on the magnitude of @xmath48 , not on its sign .     and @xmath52 for the lower band of energy @xmath53 .",
    "in both panels @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . ]    the hamiltonian studied here is , therefore , @xmath57 before moving on , we briefly comment on its main limitations . keeping only linear terms in the expansion of the hopping integrals",
    "is a valid approximation when @xmath48 is sufficiently small , so that the polaron cloud creates rather small local distortions . for large values of @xmath48 ,",
    "the effects of higher order coupling terms @xmath58 with @xmath59 , need to be considered because now the local distortions become large so the displacements @xmath60 may no longer be assumed to be small .",
    "this is true for all models with electron - phonon coupling . for the holstein and double - well potential models , the effect of such non - linear terms",
    "was shown to be significant in the strong coupling limit ( as defined by the linear term).@xcite    another approximation is to consider only nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping . coming back to the inspiration for this model , for",
    "a bio - like chain one could argue that the bi 6@xmath11 orbitals are quite broad and therefore next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping between them may play a role .",
    "furthermore , in 3d models @xmath61 hopping between nn o 2@xmath12 orbitals needs to be included . in 1d , however , this type of hopping is much less relevant because o atoms are separated by at least on bi atom .    finally , as already mentioned , hole - phonon coupling ( linear or to higher order ) resulting from the modulation of the on - site energies",
    "could also be included in this model .",
    "nevertheless , here we study polaron properties for the linear model discussed above , for a wide range of @xmath48 values , to explore its physics and to provide a baseline from which the effect of such additional terms can be gauged .",
    "we also note that all such further extensions can be studied with the methods we use in this work .",
    "the free - hole dispersion is obtained by diagonalizing @xmath62 .",
    "this results in two bands with eigenenergies @xmath63 , shown in fig . [",
    "fig : h0](a ) . the lower band , which will be referred to as @xmath64 , has its minimum at @xmath5 where the hybridization between @xmath11 and @xmath12-orbitals is maximal .",
    "in contrast , the hybridization vanishes at @xmath1 .    the free - hole weights @xmath65 are defined as @xmath66 and measure the overlap between the low - energy eigenstate @xmath67 and the free hole in a pure @xmath68 or @xmath12-state , respectively , and",
    "are given by : @xmath69 note that @xmath70 confirms that for @xmath1 , the low - energy free hole sits only on the @xmath12-orbitals .",
    "we are interested in the evolution of this low - energy band as the coupling to phonons is turned on , and in the nature of the resulting quasiparticle  the polaron .",
    "a lot of insight can be gained from studying the anti - adiabatic limit @xmath71 , where at sufficiently small @xmath48 the phonon cloud of the polaron is very small , _",
    "i.e. _ with at most one phonon present . the energy correction must be of order @xmath72 because @xmath73 changes the phonon number and thus has vanishing average value in the free hole ground state .",
    "consider the effects of @xmath73 .",
    "for an @xmath11-orbital hole , it allows it to hop onto the adjacent @xmath12-orbital while also emitting a phonon at this @xmath12-orbital .",
    "the phonon needs to be reabsorbed , which can occur in two ways : ( i ) by hopping to the next @xmath11-orbital , or ( ii ) by hopping back to the original @xmath11-orbital .",
    "the first process results in an effective @xmath11-@xmath11 hopping of amplitude @xmath74 , whereas the second changes the on - site @xmath11 energy by @xmath75 .    for a hole starting from a @xmath12-orbital , emission of a phonon",
    "requires the hole to hop to an adjacent @xmath11-orbital . from there the phonon",
    "can only be reabsorbed if the hole returns to the original @xmath12-orbital .",
    "this process gives an additional on - site @xmath12 energy of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the effective hamiltonian is : @xmath77 & t(1-{\\mathrm{e}^{-i k a } } ) \\\\",
    "t(1-{\\mathrm{e}^{i k a } } ) & -2 t      \\lambda - \\delta \\\\",

    "the lowest eigenenergy , _",
    "i.e. _ the polaron dispersion , is given by : @xmath79    -\\frac{\\delta}{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\sqrt{\\left [ t \\lambda        \\cos(ka)-\\frac{\\delta}{2 } \\right]^2 + 4t^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{ka}{2 } ) }    \\label{eq : eeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gives a good approximation for the polaron band in the limit @xmath80 , as discussed below .",
    "the polaron eigenstates can also be obtained by ed .",
    "our implementation is a direct extension of the method proposed in ref .",
    ", which has already been successfully applied to a variety of polaronic models : the holstein model in various dimensions,@xcite a generalized holstein model with longer range interactions,@xcite the @xmath81-@xmath82 model with hole - phonon coupling , @xcite and the breathing mode model,@xcite to name a few .",
    "we briefly review it here .",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by the following translationally invariant basis states : @xmath83 here @xmath84 is an index identifying the orbital , such that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 defines specific phonon cloud configurations , and @xmath26 is the total momentum .",

    "_ , we construct the hilbert space by acting @xmath88 times with the full hamiltonian @xmath89 on the free carrier states @xmath90 and @xmath91 and all the states which are created in this process .",
    "this quickly generates a large enough hilbert space to accurately calculate the ground state energy of the polaron with the lanczos technique.@xcite convergence is reached when an increase in the value of @xmath88 no longer produces a change in the eigenenergy .",

    "its simplest version was introduced for the holstein model,@xcite and then it was shown that it can be systematically improved by increasing the size of the variational space , _ i.e. _ which phonon configurations are included.@xcite apart from the holstein model , ma has also been shown to be very accurate for many other lattice polaron models including the bm model,@xcite the ssh model,@xcite and the double - well model.@xcite    here we propose two versions of ma : ma@xmath92 for a variational space containing states with a one - site phonon cloud , and ma@xmath93 which also includes states with one additional phonon on a site adjacent to this one - site phonon cloud .",
    "ma@xmath93 is a restricted version of ma@xmath94 which allows the additional phonon to be at any distance from the cloud.@xcite it can also be viewed as a simplified version of the two - site cloud version described in ref . for the breathing mode model .",
    "the latter can be implemented easily for this model as well but is more cumbersome to generalize to higher dimensions .",

    "the key finding is that at sufficiently large hole - phonon coupling , the polaron undergoes a sharp transition where its gs momentum jumps from @xmath125 to @xmath126 .",

    "such a discontinuous transition has not been discussed before .",
    "these results suggest that there may be more new physics to be discovered in models of carrier - phonon coupling different from that of the much studied one - band models of the holstein and fr \" ohlich type .",
    "we argued that this transition is due to a competition between the bare hopping @xmath138 and the phonon - modulated hopping @xmath118 : the former favors a @xmath0 ground state , while the latter increases polaron mobility at @xmath1 but not at @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite who report a transition in an ssh - like model for symmetric bare hopping and antisymmetric phonon - modulated hopping , but not for symmetric phonon - modulated hopping .",
    "we have used arguments based on perturbation theory , but also more general symmetry arguments , to support the view that the discontinuous nature of this transition is closely tied to the two - band nature of the model . in perturbation",
    "theory the hybridization between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands leads to the square root dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eeff ] ) , which is the main ingredient needed for this type of discontinuous jump of the gs momentum .",
    "we believe that it is highly unlikely that a transition with such a discontinuous jump can be found in a one - band model .",
    "this suggests that the polaron properties of multi - band models are qualitatively different from those of one - band models , and that more work needs to be done to exhaustively study all possible types of polaron transitions . whether such transitions also occurs in 2d and 3d models where nn hopping between oxygens",
    "is also included is not a priori clear ; we believe this to be the case and we are currently investigating such models .",
    "when extended to one - site phonon cloud configurations with an arbitrary number of phonons , the arguments mentioned above allowed us to elucidate the mechanism behind the transition .",
    "they also suggested two types of ma variational approximations , where the phonon cloud is restricted to be one - site in extent ( ma@xmath92 ) and one - site cloud with at most one additional phonon on an adjacent site ( ma@xmath93 ) .",
    "we find that ma@xmath92 reproduces the gs energy with an accuracy of 6% or better while ma@xmath93 yields even better results with an accuracy of at least 2% .",
    "these values were found for @xmath103 where the phonon cloud is already very large , and therefore show that ma performs well even under difficult conditions .    of course , the ma accuracy is significantly less for the qp weights at intermediate coupling @xmath100 .",
    "this is not surprising , because the part of the eigenstates ignored by the variational calculation does contribute to the wavefunctions normalization ( and therefore serves to lower the qp weight ) even if it may not have much effect on the eigenenergy .",
    "it is important to note , however , that both ma approaches reproduce the qualitative behavior correctly , and that adding more variational states will further improve quantitative agreement .",
    "ma is also successful in predicting an accurate value for the critical coupling @xmath104 for not too small phonon frequencies . at small @xmath36 , @xmath104",
    "is underestimated by ma@xmath92 and overestimated by ma@xmath93 , so at least they provide bounds for its true value .    the major advantage of ma , when compared to ed , is its numerical cost . for ma@xmath92 one merely needs to multiply @xmath202-matrices , whereas for ma@xmath93 the largest matrix size is @xmath203 .",
    "in fact one can also store all of the @xmath204 and @xmath205 in one large sparse matrix , which further increases performance .",
    "the essential aspect is that in both cases the number of states for a given number @xmath206 of phonons is independent of @xmath206 .",
    "this is why generalizing these ma approaches to 3d will be significantly more efficient than for more general ma schemes , like that of ref . .",
