    "some of the main open questions relating to starburst activity in galaxies are the combination of physical conditions which can lead to the triggering of the burst , how long a starburst can be sustained for , and how a starburst is fuelled .    even though the definition of a starburst is not at all straightforward ( knapen & james 2009 ) , the spiral galaxy m83 ( = ngc  5236 ) is often considered a starburst host .",

    "two of the most notable features in the current context are the large field of view of the gfas data , of some 3arcmin diameter , and the success of the model in reproducing the overall structure in the velocity field .",
    "although the ionized gas is subject to strong winds from  regions and other local velocity sources , the overall galactic - scale velocity field is dominated by the gravitation of the galaxy , and most of the pixels in the observed velocity field represent the disk potential ( see , e.g. , fathi 2004 ; falcn - barroso et al .",
    "2006 ; fathi et al . 2007 ;",
    "epinat et al .",
    "moreover , the larger - scale effects due to features such as bars and spiral arms are bi - symmetric and hence their kinematic effect can be represented adequately by bi - symmetric harmonic terms in the harmonic expansion formalism ( see fathi 2004 for details ) . this explains why this method can be successfully used to determine the kinematic parameters , which were derived iteratively for a fixed inclination and by minimizing the expression @xmath67 .",
    "similar to the standard tilted - ring method ( begeman 1989 ) , the algorithm minimises the expression @xmath68 , which can be seen as the idealized case where the line - of - sight velocity @xmath69 is the result of a circular cosinusoidal term ( @xmath70 ) , a radial sinusoidal term ( @xmath71 ) , and second and third order symmetric terms caused by possible @xmath3 and @xmath72 gravitational perturbations .",
    "we can now use the harmonic model to constrain the position of the kinematic centre . to do this , we force the harmonic decomposition model to shift in the @xmath65 and @xmath66 direction , and calculate the reduced @xmath73 values ( for data@xmath44model after each step we shift the model ) across a complete grid of offsets spanning @xmath74 arcsec in both ra and dec . the results of this exercise are shown in the lower panel of fig .  [ dyncentre ] , and confirm that the best - fit position of the kinematic centre from the gh@xmath4fas field is significantly offset from that of the visible nucleus , which lies at the 2@xmath52 contour .",
    "the offset is of some 3arcsec , or just over 60pc , as summarised in table  [ centrepos ] .",
    "that table shows also how the location of the photometric centre , as determined in the previous section , coincides to within the uncertainties with that of the kinematic centre .",
    "from the data presented in this paper , and considering the results and ideas published in the literature , we can reach two scenarios for the location of the nucleus , or nuclei in m83 , which we will discuss critically below .",
    "a significant mass concentration in the central region should lead to a local increase in the stellar velocity dispersion , and this is exactly what has been reported by thatte et al .",
    "they found evidence for two distinct regions of enhanced velocity dispersion , one coinciding with the visible nucleus , the other very near the location of the photo - center .",
    "this has been interpreted by these authors as evidence for a double nucleus in m83 , and quoted as such in several papers in the literature",
    ". however , no independent confirmation of the increase in velocity dispersion near the photometric centre has been published , and houghton & thatte ( 2008 ) have recently shown from new long - slit data that there is in fact no peak in dispersion at this position . the latter authors thus refute the earlier claims , and also claim that there is no longer evidence for the presence of a `` dark '' mass concentration at the photometric centre .",
    "other authors ( mast et al .",
    "2006 ; daz et al .",
    "2006 ; rodrigues et al .",
    "2009 ) have reported localised areas of rapid change in the line - of - sight velocity in ionized gas velocity fields , and interpreted them as tracers of hidden mass concentrations .",
    "we ratify the arguments outlined in detail by houghton & thatte ( 2008 ) , who do not agree with this interpretation .",
    "the effects observed by mast , daz , and rodrigues and their collaborators , over very small fields of view , should be thought of as consequences of local and predominantly non - gravitational effects , including shocks , rather than as small areas of self - consistent rotation tracing the gravitational field of significant local mass concentrations .    one important missing piece of information is a complete two - dimensional stellar velocity field across the central region . in spite of the abundant observations , such a field has not yet been published .",
    "we tried hard to derive it from our current cirpass data set using the co stellar absorption lines , but unfortunately the signal - to - noise ratio is not high enough in most of our pixels to allow us to derive meaningful constraints on the stellar velocity field .",
    "future work should aim to address this critical lack of data .",
    "for now , there are two distinct options , which we will discuss below .",
    "the first option for the location of the nucleus of m83 is that the photometric and kinematic centre do indeed indicate the nucleus . in this case",
    ", there is either one ( hidden ) nucleus , and the visible `` nucleus '' is an extremely massive star cluster forming part of the nuclear ring structure , or there are two , as proposed by thatte et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "apart from the rather interesting constraint that it is located at the ` centre ' of the galaxy ( the photometric or isophotal , as well as the kinematic centre ) , there is , however , rather little support for this model . the original evidence by thatte et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of enhanced velocity dispersion at the position of the photometric and kinematic centre is not reproducible ( houghton & thatte 2008 ) and can be discarded , and attempts to locate an agn , which could , in principle , be used to confirm the location of the nucleus , remain unsuccessful . optical or near - ir spectra ( including our own ) do not show evidence for an agn , nor does _ chandra _ x - ray imaging ( soria & wu 2003 ) .",
    "radio measures ( e.g. , those by maddox et al .",
    "2006 ) are compromised by the complex environment from which they originate but do not favour the presence of an agn .",
    "circumstantial evidence in favour includes the morphology of the enhanced sf . considering the visible nucleus to be a very massive star cluster ( with a mass of order @xmath75comparable to that of the very most massive super star clusters known ) and part of the circumnuclear structure , the sf traces a small nuclear ring , roughly centred on the photometric / kinematic centre and with a radius of some 50pc  not unreasonable , as such small nuclear rings in other galaxies have been reported in the literature ( see , e.g. , comern et al .",
    "2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "the morphology would be that of a nuclear ring fed by gas that is flowing into the ring under the influence of the bar , a gas flow which is directly illustrated in images by the major dust lanes coming in from the bar . the nuclear ring in m83 would in such a case be very similar to that in , e.g. , m100 , which can be considered a prototype and was observed and modelled extensively by knapen et al .",

    "this is not unreasonable in principle , given the perturbed nature of the central region , as indicated by the much enhanced massive sf , and the presence of prominent dust lanes .",
    "no dust patches can be seen ( e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ cirpass_field ] ) at the location of the ` hidden nucleus ' , however , although the dust might be distributed more uniformly .",
    "the fact that the intermediate age of the visible nucleus ( b , see sect .",
    "3.2 ) is consistent with it being coeval with the star - forming arc allows us to speculate that the former might be triggered by the same inflow event which feeds the arc , or , indeed , that region b is the only cluster visible on the opposite side of a star - forming ring centred on the photometric and kinematic centre .",
    "we conclude that while we can not exclude the possibility that there is a hidden nucleus at the position of the photometric and kinematic centre of m83 , the lack of enhancement in the optical and near - ir emission and in the stellar velocity dispersion there make this option seem somewhat contrived .",
    "the second option is that the visible nucleus of m83 is indeed its nucleus , but that it is simply offset , by some 80pc in projected distance , from the photometric and kinematic centre of the galaxy .",
    "apart from the offset nucleus , the rest of the central region of m83 is relatively normal : the shape of the gas velocity field , the large - scale distribution of stars , the presence of a rather prominent bar which facilitates gas inflow , and a partial nuclear ring with abundant massive sf . of these",
    ", the velocity field is perhaps most noteworthy as it has been derived from emission from young stars , and thus offers a rather contemporary view of the region .",
    "houghton & thatte ( 2008 ) discuss this model in some detail , and favour it for explaining m83 s central region .",
    "in particular , they describe how an @xmath3 perturbation can in principle lead to an offset location of the nucleus , and give examples of various other galaxies in the literature with offset nuclei .",
    "they also highlight that they could not confirm the enhancement in stellar velocity dispersion reported by thatte et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which the latter authors had interpreted as evidence for the presence of a mass concentration , possibly a second nucleus , at the location of the photo- and kinematic centres .    one may wonder how a reasonably massive galaxy nucleus ( mass of order @xmath81 , houghton & thatte 2008 , even though this mass is only @xmath82 of the mass of the inner rapidly rotating disk of fathi et al .",
    "2008 ) can be so offset without apparent major damage to the part of the disk immediately surrounding it ( we refer here to the inner , optical / near - ir , disk ; the outer disk is rather messy as seen in references are given in sect .  1 ) .",
    "in particular , if the offset nucleus is a recent feature of this galaxy , how can even the gas velocity field , derived from emission by stars of only a few million years of age , appear relatively undisturbed by , and insensitive to , the presence of the nucleus ?    a hint at the answer to this question may be provided by the harmonic analysis which fathi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) performed as part of their study of the  fabry - perot gas velocity field of the central region of m83 .",
    "this analysis results in a systematic variation of the zero - th and second harmonic terms , which is fully consistent with the presence of an @xmath3 gravitational perturbation ( see canzian 1993 ; swaters et al .",
    "as ionized h@xmath4 gas is also subject to considerable local disturbances in the kinematics , for instance in the form of shocks related to non - circular motions or expanding hii regions , we can not conclude from this analysis that an @xmath3 perturbation is present .",
    "the  dataset of fathi et al . (",
    "2008 ) is not deep enough ( 60min exposure time ) to cover the regions outside the bar , so that the variation of the zero - th and/or second harmonic terms can not be traced reliably beyond 20arcsec .",
    "the current cirpass data set is not useful for this purpose because of its smaller field of view and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of this effect , which may lead to a confirmation of an @xmath3 signature in the velocity field , is only possible using a combination of a stellar velocity field at high spatial and spectral resolution ( ideally obtained with adaptive optics techniques ) , and covering the central 20 - 30arcsec radius of the disk in m83 .",
    "the origin of the offset nucleus , if that is indeed what it is , must be a dramatic external event such as a galaxy - galaxy interaction or a merger .",
    "phenomenologically this is not an unattractive proposition , as such an event could also explain the messy structure seen in  outside the optical disk ( see discussion in the introduction ) , and possibly even the much enhanced star - forming activity in the central region .",

    "the bulk of the current sf activity is hidden from optical view by dust extinction , but is seen prominently to the north of the nucleus in the near- and mid - ir .",
    "this region is being fed by inflow through the bar of m83 , traced by the prominent dust lane entering into the circumnuclear region from the north . from a comparison of our cirpass data and stellar population modelling",

    "* we discuss two possible options for the location and nature of the nucleus , or nuclei , of m83 .",

    "<S> we report new near - ir integral field spectroscopy of the central starburst region of the barred spiral galaxy m83 obtained with cirpass on gemini - s , which we analyse in conjunction with gfas fabry - perot data , an aat iris2 @xmath0-band image , and near- and mid - ir imaging from the _ hubble _ and _ spitzer _ space telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the current star formation activity is hidden from optical view by dust extinction , but is seen in the near- and mid - ir to the north of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> this region is being fed by inflow of gas through the bar of m83 , traced by the prominent dust lane entering into the circumnuclear region from the north . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of stellar ages confirms that the youngest stars are indeed in the northwest . </S>",
    "<S> a gradual age gradient , with older stars further to the south , characterises the well - known star - forming arc in the central region of m83 , and is consistent with a stable scenario where gas inflow into the central regions is facilitated by the galactic bar .    </S>",
    "<S> detailed analyses of the pa@xmath1  ionised gas kinematics and near - ir imaging confirm that the kinematic centre coincides with the photometric centre of m83 , and that these are offset significantly , by about 3arcsec or 60pc , from the visible nucleus of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two possible options , the first of which postulates that the kinematic and photometric centre traces a galaxy nucleus hidden by a substantial amount of dust extinction , in the range @xmath2mag . by combining this information with kinematic results and using arguments from the literature , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that such a scenario is , however , unlikely , as is the existence of other `` hidden '' nuclei in m83 .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus concur with recent authors and favour a second option , in which the nucleus of the galaxy is offset from its kinematic and photometric centre . </S>",
    "<S> this is presumably a result of some past interaction , possibly related to the event which lies at the origin of the disturbance of the outer disk of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we find some indications for a disturbance in the  velocity field which would confirm the influence of the @xmath3 perturbation in the gravitational potential , but note that further high - quality stellar kinematic data are needed to confirm this scenario .    </S>",
