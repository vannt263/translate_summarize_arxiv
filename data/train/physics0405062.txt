    "serious scientific interest in the emission of electromagnetic radiation by charged particles moving faster than the speed of light _ in vacuo _ began with the work of sommerfeld in 1904 and 1905  @xcite .",
    "the timing of this work was perhaps unfortunate , as the special theory of relativity was published within a few months  @xcite ; any known particle that has a charge has also a rest mass and so can not be accelerated through the speed of light .",
    "moreover , an additional conceptual barrier discouraged further work : even a massless particle can not move faster than light _ in vacuo _ if it is charged , because if it did , it would give rise to an infinitely strong electromagnetic field on the envelope of the wave fronts that emanate from it  @xcite .    by and large , this field remained dormant until ginzburg and colleagues  @xcite pointed out that , though no superluminal source of electromagnetic fields can be point - like , there are no physical principles preventing _ extended _ faster - than - light sources",
    ". the coordinated motion of aggregates of subluminally - moving charged particles can give rise to macroscopic polarization currents whose distribution patterns move superluminally  @xcite .",
    "further relevant progress occurred with the theoretical prediction that extended sources that move faster than their own waves could be responsible for the extreme properties of both the electromagnetic emission from pulsars ( rapidly spinning , magnetized neutron stars )  @xcite and the acoustic emission by supersonic rotors and propellers  @xcite .",
    "finally , theoretical treatments of a particular class of source of this type  @xcite were stimulated by the design and construction of the apparatus that is the subject of the current paper .",
    "this apparatus implements an extended polarization current distribution that has the time dependence of a traveling wave with centripetally - accelerated superluminal motion and an oscillating amplitude .",
    "@xcite point out several distinctive characteristics of the emission by such sources :    1 .",
    "the radiation emitted from each volume element of the superluminally - moving polarization - current distribution pattern comprises a erenkov - like envelope with two sheets that meet along a cusp .",
    "the combined effect of the volume elements leads to a frequency - independent beaming in both the azimuthal and polar directions whose geometry is determined by the structure of the erenkov - like envelopes  @xcite .",
    "2 .   the above - mentioned cusps , which spiral upwards and outwards from the source into the far zone  @xcite , result from the centripetal acceleration of the source ; without acceleration",
    ", the wave fronts would merely pile up on a two - dimensional envelope  @xcite .",
    "the cusps result in the reception , during a short time period , of radiation emitted over a considerably longer period of ( retarded ) source time .",
    "consequently , the intensity of the radiation at these angles declines more slowly with increasing distance from the source than would the emission from a conventional antenna .",
    "note , however , that energy conservation is not violated ; large intensities on the cusp are compensated by weaker radiation fields elsewhere .",
    "the propagating cusp is being reconstructed constantly from conventional ( _ i.e. _  spherically - decaying ) waves that combine and then disperse .",
    "3 .   under certain conditions",
    ", the emitted radiation contains a broad spectral distribution of high frequencies that are not present in the synthesis of the moving , oscillating polarization current .",
    "these originate from the centripetal acceleration , and from space - time discontinuities forced on the polarization - current distribution by the constraints of its circular path .    based on the above ideas , we have constructed an experimental realization of an extended , oscillating superluminal source that undergoes centripetal acceleration .",
    "the present paper describes the basic principles of the machine , and its use to demonstrate the first two theoretical findings listed above ; the high frequency emission will be the subject of a future work .",
    "we find that the emission of the source is well described by the models of refs .",
    "@xcite , confirming the validity of extended superluminal polarization currents as precisely controllable sources of electromagnetic radiation with novel properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ experiment ] gives a description of the experimental considerations necessary to understand the data from the superluminal source . since practical superluminal sources are relatively novel , and since the raw experimental data are affected by the proximity of the source to the ground in a way familar only to communications engineers  @xcite , this section is by necessity rather detailed ; without a thorough explanation of these effects , the experimental data are not readily understood . within it ,",
    "subsection  [ expa ] describes how the polarization current distribution is created and animated ( set in motion ) at superluminal speeds within a curved strip of alumina .",
    "the experimental geometry , and in particular its relationship to the coordinate systems used in the theoretical papers  @xcite is discussed in subsection  [ expb ] , whilst the detection system and the effects of interference from the ground are described in subsection  [ expc ] .",
    "experimental results commence in section  [ beams ] , which describes data that conclusively demonstrate the three - dimensional angular distributions of the erenkov - like envelopes emitted by the source .",
    "section  [ nonspherical ] describes range tests exhibiting the non - spherically - decaying radiation close to the cusp ; in spite of the non - ideal nature of the experimental machine and the measurement geometry ( which complicated by interference from the ground ) it is possible to conclusively identify this feature within the emission data . a discussion , conclusions and summary are given in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the paper ends with an appendix describing the mathematical treatment of interference due to reflections from the ground .",
    "in addition , the appendix details the fitting methods used to obtain the exponent of the non - spherical decay associated with the cusps , and summarizes the parts of the theory given in refs .",
    "@xcite that are used to model the beaming observed in the experimental data .",
    "the first step in investigating superluminal effects is to identify a source that can travel faster than the speed of light _ in vacuo _ without violating einstein s theory of special relativity  @xcite .",
    "the required source explicitly appears in the ampre - maxwell equation , which underlies the emission of electromagnetic radiation  @xcite : @xmath0 here * h * is the magnetic field strength , @xmath1 is the current density of free charges , @xmath2 is the displacement , @xmath3 is the electric field and @xmath4 is the polarization ; the term @xmath5 represents the _ polarization current density_. an oscillating or accelerating current density @xmath1 emits electromagnetic radiation ( _ i.e. _  it acts as a source ) and is well - understood ; this is the basis of conventional radio transmission  @xcite and the use of synchrotrons as light sources  @xcite . however , as a current density of free charges is composed of particles such as electrons or protons , einstein s theory of special relativity naturally forbids such a source from traveling faster than the speed of light .",

    "experimentally , this is done by observing the time dependence of the voltages on each electrode ( figure  [ fig2](b ) ) using a high - speed oscilloscope .",
    "finally , it should be emphasised that great care was taken to minimize unwanted radiation from the amplifiers , cabling and signal generators of the apparatus to ensure that the detected signal was dominated by the emission from the polarization current .",
    "steps taken included proper encasing of all of the signal generation equipment , the enclosure of the 41 amplifiers inside thick copper shields ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and the correct impedance matching of connections .      to map out the spatial distribution of the radiation from the superluminal source",
    ", one would ideally position the array in empty space and move a detector to points around it , covering a comprehensive range of angles and distances .",
    "however , practical experiments must be conducted close to the earth s surface , where reflections from the ground are a complicating factor  @xcite ( see appendix ) ; numerous tests showed that highly reproducible data are obtained when the `` ground '' under the path between array and detector is smooth , level and of a uniform quality  @xcite .",
    "after trials at several locations , the bituminised macadam surface of an airfield runway ( turweston aerodrome , near northampton , uk ) was found to be almost ideal in providing a substantial length of well - characterized surface .",
    "all of the experiments reported in the current paper employ the runway , which is approximately 900  m long and 20  m wide .",
    "a change in slope about two - thirds of the way along the runway restricts the range tests reported in section  [ nonspherical ] to distances of 600  m or less .",
    "however , measurements of the angular distribution of the radiated power from the array ( section  [ beams ] ) employed the full length of 900  m.    the geometry of the runway dictates that the best configuration for measuring the spatial and angular distribution of the radiation is to fix the position of the detector ( on the runway , at a distance @xmath27 from the source ) and to change the orientation of the array to access a full range of polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "this is accomplished by placing the array on a platform that tilts about a horizontal - axis pivot at one end ; this is in turn fixed on a turntable that can rotate about a vertical axis .",
    "it is possible to mount the array on the platform in two configurations . in the first , the array plane is vertical ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) , so that its long axis can be tilted ( about the horizontal pivot ) to an angle @xmath28 with respect to horizontal ; the turntable is then rotated about a vertical axis so that the array plane makes an angle @xmath29 ( in the horizontal plane ) with the line connecting the detector at p and the array center . in the second configuration , the array plane is initially horizontal ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) ; the array plane is then tilted using the horizontal pivot to an angle @xmath30 with respect to horizontal .",
    "the turntable is then rotated about a vertical axis so that the projection of the long axis of the array on the horizontal plane makes an angle @xmath31 with the line connecting the detector at p and the array center .    finally , to aid comparison of experiment and theory , it is necessary to relate the experimental spherical polar coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are measured relative to the array center , to the cylindrical and spherical polar coordinates used to evaluate the integrals in the appendix and in refs .  @xcite . in the latter papers , each volume element of the superluminal source distribution traverses a complete circular orbit centered at the origin of the coordinate system , and the radial distances to the individual source elements and to the observation point at @xmath34 are specified with respect to the common center of these circular orbits ( see fig .  [ fig3](c ) and ( d ) ) .",

    "consequently , the intensity of the radiation at these angles was observed to decline more slowly with increasing distance from the source than would the emission from a conventional antenna .",
    "the angular distribution of the emitted radiation and the properties associated with the cusp are in good _ quantitative _ agreement with theoretical models of superluminal sources once the effect of reflections from the earth s surface are taken into account .",
    "in particular , the prediction that the beaming and the slow decay should extend into the far - zone has been tested to several hundred fresnel distances .",
    "the above results have implications not only for the interpretation of observational data on pulsars , which originally motivated the theoretical investigation of the present emission process  @xcite , but also for a diverse set of disciplines and technologies in which these findings have potential practical applications  @xcite .",
    "one such technology is long - range and high - bandwidth telecommunications .",
    "since all of the processes involved in generating the polarization current distribution are linear , and the direction of the emitted `` beam '' only depends on the source speed , it should be simple to use an array to broadcast several beams in different directions simultaneously",
    ". this could be achieved by applying voltages which are sums of terms like eq .",
    "[ volt1 ] , each with a different speed , to the electrodes of an array .",
    "the beaming is frequency independent , and so an array could potentially be used to transmit multiple directed beams at several frequencies .",
    "( the very small side lobes , especially in free space , are a further characteristic of the beaming produced by the present emission mechanism that facilitates this type of transmission . )    of particular practical significance are the properties of the non - spherically - decaying component of the radiation that we have observed : the fact that its intensity decays like @xmath133 , rather than @xmath134 , with the distance @xmath27 from its source , and that its beam - width is less than @xmath208 at @xmath209 m. this radiation mechanism could thus be used , in principle , to convey electronic data over very long distances with very much lower attenuation than is possible with existing sources . in the case of ground - to - satellite communications , for example ,",
    "the above properties imply that either far fewer satellites would be required for the same bandwidth or each satellite could handle a much wider range of signals for the same power output .",
    "the excellent correspondence between the experimental data and theoretical predictions supports the proposal that polarization current distributions act as superluminal sources of radiation , and that they can be used for studying and utilizing the novel effects associated with superluminal electrodynamics .",
    "the apparatus described in this paper represents just one possible geometry and excitation scheme . in principle , a whole class of superluminal sources are possible , corresponding , for example , to a rectilinearly accelerated polarization current  @xcite ( rather than a centripetally accelerated one ) , or to a medium that is polarized by impinging laser beams ( rather than by applied voltages ) , and so on .",

    "<S> we describe the experimental implementation of a superluminal ( _ i.e. _  faster than light _ in vacuo _ ) polarization current distribution that both oscillates and undergoes centripetal acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical treatments predict that the radiation emitted by each volume element of the superluminally - moving distribution pattern will comprise a erenkov - like envelope with two sheets that meet along a cusp . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the emission from the experimental machine is found to be tightly beamed in both the azimuthal and polar directions . </S>",
    "<S> the beaming is frequency independent and has a sharply - defined and unchanging geometry determined only by the speed and path of the moving distribution pattern , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _  by the parameters governing the structure of the erenkov - like envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , over a restricted range of angles , we detect the presence of cusps in the emitted radiation . </S>",
    "<S> these , which are due to the focusing of wave fronts on a propagating space curve , result in the reception , during a short time period , of radiation emitted over a considerably longer period of ( retarded ) source time . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the radiation at these angles was observed to decline more slowly with increasing distance from the source than would the emission from a conventional antenna . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distribution of the emitted radiation and the properties associated with the cusps are in good _ quantitative _ agreement with theoretical models of superluminal sources once the effect of reflections from the earth s surface are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the prediction that the beaming and the slow decay should extend into the far zone has been tested to several hundred fresnel distances ( rayleigh ranges ) . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent agreement between the theoretical calculations and the data suggests that the apparatus achieves precise and reproducible control of the polarization current and that similar machines could be of general interest for studying and utilizing the novel effects associated with superluminal electrodynamics . </S>"
