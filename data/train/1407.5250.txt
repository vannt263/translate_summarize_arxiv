    "self - assembled - monolayer ( sam ) based molecular junctions ( mjs ) may become the basic building block for future molecular organic electronics @xcite .",
    "the most common theoretical tool to analyze sam - mjs transport properties is the so - called simmons model , which essentially treats the mjs as a square potential barrier , typically taking the difference between the fermi level in the electrodes and the molecular orbital energy as the barrier height @xcite .",
    "evidently , such a phenomenological model can not capture all the subtleties that accompany sam molecular structure @xcite .",
    "for instance , it does not explicitly take into account the inter - molecular interactions , experimentally proven to have a large effect on the transport properties of sam - mjs ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a more microscopic approach to study transport properties of sam - mjs",
    "is based on calculating the transmission function of the sam - mj using green s functions @xcite , treating the sam as a perfect periodic lattice @xcite and assuming that the sam generate coherent electronic bands @xcite .",
    "there are two prominent hallmarks of transport through sam - mjs .",
    "the first is the exponential decay of current ( or conductance at low biases ) with the number of molecules in the molecular chains which form the sam ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "typically , the conductance decays exponentially with the chain length and is given by g = g_0 e^-n [ cond - decay ]  , where @xmath0 describes the tunneling from the electrodes into the molecule , @xmath1 is the exponential decay coefficient and @xmath2 the number of atoms in the molecule .",
    "@xmath1 is commonly discussed within the simmons model , where the width of the barrier replaces the molecular length .",
    "this is clearly an over - simplification of the molecular junction @xcite , since , for instance , @xmath1 does not take into account the detailed structure of the molecule and certainly not the sam inter - molecular tunneling .",
    "the simmons model was extended to account for inter - molecular coupling @xcite assuming fully incoherent electron tranfer between neighboring molecules . within the microscopic theory ,",
    "the exponential decay of length is explained as off - resonant tunneling @xcite , when the fermi energy lies outside the coherent band formed by the sam ( effectively making it similar to the simmons model ) .",
    "this theory has several drawbacks .",
    "first , the exponential decay typically persists even at large biases where the energies may be beyond the band edges .",
    "furthermore , it seems that the exponential decay is a universal feature , which may occur even if the fermi energy lies within the molecular bands .",
    "assuming intra - molecular coupling @xmath3 and inter - molecular coupling @xmath4 , the width of the molecular band would be @xmath5 , which means that to lie outside the molecular band the fermi level has to lie at a distance @xmath6 from the molecular level .",
    "an estimate of intra - molecular coupling of @xmath7 ev and a similar value for @xmath4 would mean that the fermi level has to lie at least @xmath8ev away from the molecular orbitals .",
    "put differently , the fact that in a _ single molecule _ junction the transport is off - resonance does not guarantee that it is the case also for transport through a sam - mj of the same molecule , due to the inter - molecular coupling .",
    "the second hallmark of transport through sam - mjs is the reduction of the current per molecule , as compared to a single - molecule junction with the same molecule .",
    "experimentally , it has been shown that the current of a sam - mj is dramatically smaller ( by three orders of magnitude ) than for a single - molecule junction with the same molecules , a reduction that has been attributed to the molecular environment of the sam @xcite .",
    "this was addressed by landau _",
    "@xcite , who showed a reduction in the transmission function of a sam as compared to the single - molecule junction . as discussed in details in the supplemental material , we have repeated the calculation ( using a wide - band approximation ) , essentially reproducing the results of ref .",
    "however , the calculation shows that in order to achieve a three orders of magnitude reduction in the current , an unphysical inter - molecular coupling that exceeds @xmath9 ev is needed , again pointing to an inconsistency between the theory and experiment .",
    "overcoming the above apparent inconsistencies is the main goal of this work .",
    "to do so , we posit that a central missing ingredient in the coherent band description is the dephasing in the electron motion as it traverses the sam plane",
    ". this dephasing may occur due to the interaction of electrons with the soft surface phonon modes @xcite , that are not present in single - molecule junctions ( which only have optical modes ) .",
    "these soft modes can strongly affect the electron motion ( electron - phonon interaction strength is inversely proportional to the phonon frequency ) , but the electron - phonon scattering can be almost elastic , resulting only in the loss of electron phases during its motion in the sam plane . dephasing due to electron - phonon interactions ( along the molecular chain ) in single - molecule junctions",
    "was recently shown to lead to an exponential decay of conductance with length for short molecular wires @xcite .",

    "the homo energy can vary on a scale of @xmath71 ev due to slight changes in molecular alignment with the electrode .",
    "sam - mjs , on the other hand , seem to be much more stable against these fluctuations , and the current distributions are significantly narrower than for single - molecule junctions . the flattened transmission function of sam - mjs may offer a possible explanation , since changes in the position of the lumo do not affect much the transmission ( see supplemental material ) .",
    "the flattening of the transmission function has an additional consequence , as it provides the prediction that the thermopower of sam - mjs would be substantially smaller than the thermopower of single - molecule junctions .",
    "the reason is that , at least at low temperatures , the thermopower @xmath72 is proportional to the logarithmic derivative of the transmission @xcite , @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the fermi energy ) .",

    "a detailed analysis of thermopower of sams is left for a future publication .",
    "the dephasing mechanism we present here can also account for the more subtle features of transport through sam - mjs .",
    "an example is the odd - even effect , which was recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite : the total current at a given voltage ( or equivalently the conductance ) shows the usual exponential decay with respect to the number or molecular elements ( number of ethylenes in ref .",

    "[ fig6 ] , where the transmission as a function of molecular length is plotted for @xmath78 ev , and the odd - even effect can not be detected .",
    "the odd - even effect is thus due to the delicate competition between coherent transport in the direction of the molecules and dephasing along the sam plane .",

    "when a molecular junction is placed under a voltage bias , the current is typically a monotonically increasing function of bias ( resulting in the usual positive differential resistance ) .",

    "is plotted for different values of voltage @xmath87 ev ( for @xmath88 ) , and the decrease in the total transmission is seen .",
    "the origin of the ndr is thus the following : the current is defined as the integral of the transmission function over the voltage drop window . as the voltage bias increases , the integration window increases , but simultaneously the transmission function decreases , and these are two competing effects . for low voltages the increase in current is due to the increase in the integration window . at a certain voltage which depends on the molecular parameters ( marked in dashed line in the top - left inset ) , the two effects balance each other , leading to a maximum in the current . beyond this bias ,",
    "the reduction of the transmission due to the voltage drop along the junction becomes dominant , resulting in a decrease in the current and ndr .",

    "in summary , we have shown that incorporating in - plane dephasing into the transport calculation allows us to explain several universal transport features of sam - mjs .",

    "we conclude by pointing out that the method introduced here , which inherently incorporates dephasing , can be simply implemented within quantum chemistry methods ( and density - functional theory ( dft ) in particular ) which have been employed to study transport through single - molecule junctions .",

    "<S> self - assembled - monolayer ( sam ) molecular junctions ( mjs ) constitute a promising building block candidate for future molecular electronic devices . transport properties of sam - mjs are usually calculate using either the phenomenological simmons model , or a fully - coherent transport theory , employing the sams periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that dephasing plays an important role in determining the transport properties of sam - mjs . </S>",
    "<S> we present an approach for calculating the transport properties of sam - mjs that inherently takes into account in - plane dephasing in the electron motion as it traverses the sam plane . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is based on the non - equilibrium green s function formalism , with a local dynamics approximation that describes incoherent motion along the sam plane . </S>",
    "<S> our approach describes well the two hallmarks of transport through sam - mjs , namely the exponential decay of current with molecular chain length and the reduction of the current per molecule as compared to single - molecule junctions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that dephasing leads to an exponential decay of the current as a function of molecular length , even for resonant tunneling , where the fully coherent calculation shows little or no length - dependence of the current . </S>",
    "<S> the dephasing is also shown to lead to a substantial reduction of the current in a sam - mj as compared to the single molecule junction , in a realistic parameter regime , where the coherent calculation shows only a very small reduction of the current . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the effect of dephasing on more subtle transport phenomena such as the conductance even - odd effect and negative differential resistance . </S>"
