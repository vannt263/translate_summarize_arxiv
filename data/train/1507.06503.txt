    "computing distances between shapes of open or closed curves is of interest in many fields that require shape analysis , from medical imaging to video surveillance , to radar detection .",
    "while the shape of an organ or a human contour can be modeled by a closed plane curve , some applications require the manipulation of curves lying in a non flat manifold , such as @xmath4-valued curves representing trajectories on the earth or curves in the space of hermitian positive definite matrices , where the values represent covariance matrices of gaussian processes .",
    "the shape space of planar curves has been widely studied ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , and the more general setting of shapes lying in any manifold @xmath0 has recently met great interest ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . here",

    "we say formal because the manifold structure of the space @xmath17,m)$ ] has not yet been thoroughly studied to our knowledge .",

    "@xmath31 denote the horizontal parts of @xmath22 and @xmath23 according to the previously mentioned decomposition , as well as the horizontal lifts of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",

    "the most natural candidate for a reparameterization invariant metric @xmath16 on @xmath3 is the @xmath43-metric with integration over arc length , but michor and mumford have shown in @xcite that the induced metric @xmath29 on the shape space always vanishes .",
    "this has motivated the study of sobolev metrics ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , and particularly of a first - order sobolev metric on the space of plane curves , @xmath44 where we integrate according to arc length @xmath45 and @xmath46 denotes the euclidean metric on @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the derivation of @xmath22 according to arc length , @xmath49 is the projection of @xmath50 on the unit length tangent vector field @xmath51 along @xmath24 , and @xmath52 is the projection of @xmath50 on the unit length normal vector field @xmath53 along @xmath24 .",
    "this particular first - order sobolev metric is of interest because it can be studied via the square root velocity ( srv ) framework , introduced by srivastava et al . in @xcite and used in several applications ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this framework can be extended to curves in a general manifold by using parallel transport , in a way which allows us to move the computations to the tangent plane to the origin of one of the two curves under comparison , see @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the transformation used is a generalization of the srv function introduced by bauer et al . in @xcite as a tool to study a more general form of the sobolev metric . in @xcite a riemannian framework",
    "is given , including the associated riemannian metric and the geodesic equations .",
    "while our approach in this paper is similar , we feel that the distance we introduce here will be more directly dependent on the `` relief '' of the manifold , since it is computed in the manifold itself rather than in one tangent plane as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this enables us to take into account a greater amount of information on the space separating two curves .",
    "we consider the square root velocity function ( srvf ) introduced in @xcite on the space of curves in @xmath0 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the norm associated to the riemannian metric on @xmath0 .",
    "this function will allow us to define a metric @xmath16 on @xmath3 by pullback of a metric @xmath56 on @xmath57 .",
    "first , we define the following projections from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be a curve in @xmath59 that passes through @xmath62 at time @xmath63 at speed @xmath64 .",
    "then we define the vertical and horizontal projections @xmath65 the horizontal and vertical projections live in the tangent bundle @xmath66 and are not to be confused with the horizontal and vertical parts which live in the double tangent bundle @xmath58 and will be denoted by @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , let us point out that the horizontal projection is simply the differential of the natural projection @xmath69 , and that according to these definitions , the sasaki metric ( @xcite , @xcite ) can be written @xmath70 where @xmath46 denotes the riemannian metric on @xmath0 .",
    "now we can define the metric that we put on @xmath57 .",
    "let us consider @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we define @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the horizontal and vertical projections of @xmath76 for all @xmath77",
    ". then we have the following result .",
    "the pullback of the metric @xmath56 by the square root velocity function @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 for any curve @xmath19 and vectors @xmath80 , where we integrate according to arc length , @xmath81 is the covariant derivative of @xmath22 according to arc length , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are its tangential and normal components respectively .    in the case of curves in a flat space , @xmath16 is the first - order sobolev metric , studied in @xcite , with an added term involving the origins .",
    "this extra term guaranties that the induced distance is always greater than the distance between the starting points of the curves in @xmath0 .    for any @xmath19 , and @xmath21 , the metric @xmath16",
    "is defined by @xmath84 for any @xmath85 $ ] , we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 . to prove this proposition",
    ", we just need to compute the latter .",
    "let @xmath88 be a curve in @xmath3 such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 . here and",
    "in all the paper we use the notations @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "the special role that plays the starting point in the metric @xmath16 induces another formal fiber bundle structure , where the base space is the manifold @xmath0 , seen as the set of starting points of the curves , and the fibers are the set of curves with the same origin .",
    "the projection is then @xmath106 it induces another decomposition of the tangent bundle in vertical and horizontal bundles @xmath107    we have the usual decomposition @xmath108 , the horizontal bundle @xmath109 consists of parallel vector fields along @xmath24 , and @xmath110 is ( formally ) a riemannian submersion for @xmath101 and @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a tangent vector .",
    "consider @xmath112 the parallel vector field along @xmath24 with initial value @xmath113 .",
    "it is a horizontal vector , since its vanishing covariant derivative along @xmath24 assures that for any vertical vector @xmath114 we have @xmath115 .",
    "the difference @xmath116 between those two horizontal vectors has initial value @xmath63 and so it is a vertical vector , which gives a decomposition of @xmath22 into a horizontal vector and a vertical vector . the definition of @xmath117 as the orthogonal complement of @xmath118 guaranties that their sum is direct . now",
    "if @xmath23 is another tangent vector , then the scalar product between their horizontal parts is @xmath119 and this completes the proof .",
    "here we will give an expression for the geodesic distance induced by the metric @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider two curves @xmath120 , and a path of curves @xmath121 linking them in @xmath3 @xmath122 for all @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath124 the image of this path of curves by the srvf @xmath78 .",
    "note that @xmath125 is a vector field along the surface @xmath24 in @xmath0 .",
    "let now @xmath126 be the raising of @xmath125 in the tangent plane @xmath127 in the following way @xmath128 where we denote by @xmath129 the parallel transport along a curve @xmath130 from @xmath131 to @xmath132 .",
    "notice that @xmath126 is a surface in a vector space , as illustrated in figure [ fig ] .",
    "lastly , we introduce a vector field @xmath133 in @xmath0 , which parallel translates @xmath134 along @xmath135 to its origin , then along @xmath136 and back down again , as shown in figure [ fig ] .",
    "more precisely @xmath137 for all @xmath138 . that way the quantity @xmath139 measures the holonomy along the rectangle of infinitesimal width shown in figure [ fig ] .",
    "we can now formulate our result .",
    "[ distance1 ] with the above notations , the geodesic distance induced by the riemannian metric @xmath16 between two curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the space @xmath1,m)$ ] of parameterized curves is given by @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the square root velocity representation of the curve @xmath24 and the norm is the one associated to the riemannian metric on @xmath0 .",
    "it can also be written @xmath142 where @xmath126 is the raising of @xmath125 in the tangent plane @xmath127 and the curvature term @xmath143 is given by @xmath144 if @xmath145 denotes the curvature tensor of the manifold @xmath0 .",
    "our original motivation for this work was to find a geodesic distance ( that is , a distance induced by a riemannian metric ) that resembled the product distance introduced in @xcite .",
    "in the first term under the square root of expression we can see the velocity vector of the curve @xmath136 linking the two origins , and in the second the velocity vector of the curve @xmath126 linking the tsrvf - images of the curves  transported square root velocity function , as introduced by su et al . in @xcite .",
    "however there is also a curvature term @xmath143 which , as previously mentionned , measures the holonomy along the rectangle of infinitesimal width shown in figure [ fig ] .",
    "if instead we equip the tangent bundle @xmath2 with the metric @xmath146 for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , then the curvature term @xmath143 vanishes and the geodesic distance on @xmath3 becomes @xmath149 where the norm of the second term under the square root is the @xmath43-norm , and which corresponds exactly to the geodesic distance associated to the metric on the space @xmath150,t_pm)$ ] introduced by zhang et al . in @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two distances and resides in the curvature term @xmath143 , which translates the fact that in the first one , we compute the distance in the manifold , whereas in the second , it is computed in the tangent space to one of the origins of the curves .",
    "therefore , the first one takes more directly into account the `` relief '' of the manifold between the two curves under comparison .",
    "for example , if there is a `` bump '' between two curves in an otherwise relatively flat space , the second distance might not see it , whereas the first one will thanks to the curvature term .",
    "let us briefly consider the flat case : if the manifold @xmath0 is flat , the two distances and coincide . if two curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 in a flat space have the same starting point @xmath151 , the first summand under the square root vanishes and the distance becomes the @xmath43-distance between the two srv representations @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "if two curves in a flat space differ only by a translation , then the distance is simply the distance between their origins .     and",
    "@xmath26 in the space of curves @xmath3,width=309 ]    since @xmath16 is defined by pullback of @xmath56 by the srvf @xmath78 , we know that the lengths of @xmath24 in @xmath3 and of @xmath154 in @xmath2 are equal and so that @xmath155 with @xmath156 now let us fix @xmath123 $ ] . then @xmath157 is a vector field along @xmath158 , and so @xmath159 we consider the vector field @xmath160 along the surface @xmath161 that is parallel along all curves @xmath135 and takes value @xmath162 in @xmath163 for any @xmath164 $ ] , that is @xmath165 for all @xmath166 $ ] and @xmath167 $ ] . that way we know that @xmath168 for all @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "then we can express its covariant derivative in the following way @xmath170 now let us fix @xmath166 $ ] as well .",
    "notice that the vector field @xmath171 defined above verifies @xmath172 for all @xmath173 $ ] .",
    "note that unlike @xmath160 , we do _ not _ have @xmath174 because @xmath175 is only true for @xmath176 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the last term of equation is precisely the covariant derivative of the vector field @xmath171 @xmath177 since for any @xmath178 $ ] , @xmath179 , and finally by composing by @xmath180 , we obtain the second expression , which completes the proof .",
    "in order to be able to compute the distance given by between two curves , we first need to compute the optimal deformation @xmath181 from one to the other . in other words , we need to characterize the geodesics of @xmath35 for our metric . in order to do so",
    ", we use the variational principle .",
    "the beginning of the calculations are very similar to those in @xcite .",
    "let us consider two curves @xmath182 and a path @xmath183\\ni s \\mapsto c(s,\\cdot)\\in\\mathcal m$ ] going from one to the other .",
    "this path @xmath24 is a geodesic if it minimizes the energy functional @xmath184 @xmath185 let @xmath186 , @xmath187 , be a proper variation of the path @xmath181 , meaning that it coincides with @xmath24 in @xmath188 , and it preserves its end points @xmath189 then @xmath24 is a geodesic of @xmath35 if @xmath190 for any proper variation @xmath186 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath191 , for @xmath192 , the energy of a proper variation of @xmath24 , then we have @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the srv representation of @xmath24 .",
    "its derivative is given by @xmath195 considering that the variation preserves the end points , integration by parts gives @xmath196 and so we obtain @xmath197 this quantity has to vanish in @xmath188 for all proper variations @xmath198 unfortunately , we can not yield any conclusions at this point , because @xmath199 and @xmath200 can not be chosen independently , since @xmath125 is not any vector field along @xmath24 but its image via the square root velocity function . using the notations @xmath201 and the lighter notation @xmath202 to denote the parallel transport along a curve @xmath24 of a vector field @xmath203 , the following simple manipulations provide us with a solution @xmath204 since the variations @xmath205 and @xmath206 can be chosen independently for all @xmath207 , we obtain the following characterization of the geodesics @xmath181 of @xmath35 @xmath208 finally , using the definition of @xmath209 , the geodesic equations are    @xmath210    where @xmath125 is the srv representation of @xmath24 , the vector field @xmath211 is given by @xmath212 and @xmath213 with @xmath214 , is the tangential component of @xmath211 .",
    "in this section , we describe an algorithm which allows us to compute the geodesic @xmath181 starting from a point @xmath215 at speed @xmath216",
    ". this amounts to finding the optimal deformation of the curve @xmath24 in the direction of the vector field @xmath203 according to our metric .",
    "we initialize this path @xmath181 by setting @xmath217 and @xmath218 , and we propagate it using iterations of fixed step @xmath219 .",
    "the aim is , given @xmath135 and @xmath220 , to deduce @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "the first is obtained by following the exponential map on the manifold @xmath0 @xmath223 and the second requires the computation of the variation @xmath224 @xmath225^{s , s+\\epsilon},\\ ] ] where once again , we use the notation @xmath226 for the parallel transport of a vector field @xmath227 along a curve @xmath228 in @xmath0 . if we suppose that at time @xmath207 we have @xmath135 and @xmath220 , then we also know @xmath229 and @xmath230 , as well as @xmath231 and @xmath232 using the fact that @xmath94 .",

    "now , if we no longer have a continuous curve but a series of discrete observations @xmath239 made at discrete times @xmath240 , then the optimal deformation of these points in the direction of a series of tangent vectors @xmath241 , where @xmath242 for @xmath243 , can be computed by the following steps .",

    "in the same way that the first - order sobolev metric on the space of plane curves can be obtained as the pullback of the @xmath43-metric by the square root velocity function ( @xcite ) , our metric @xmath16 can be obtained as the pullback of a natural metric @xmath56 on the tangent bundle @xmath2 by the same srvf . as such it is reparameterization invariant , and induces a riemannian metric @xmath29 on the shape space @xmath13 for which the fiber bundle projection is formally a riemannian submersion . on the other hand ,",
