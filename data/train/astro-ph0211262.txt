    "in this paper we provide estimates for weak interaction rates involving intermediate mass nuclei .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have argued that at late times the electron fraction in the fe core of pre - supernova stars can be so low that weak processes involving the a@xmath1 nuclei we study are important .",
    "depending on the entropy per baryon , which determines the free proton fraction , electron capture on heavy nuclei may also play an important role during collapse @xcite .",
    "in addition , the weak rates we provide for proton rich nuclei may be used in studies of nucleosynthesis and energy generation in x - ray bursts and other _ rp-_process sites @xcite . for the _ rp-_process ,",
    "weak rates are needed for proton rich nuclei at least up to mass 110 .",
    "electron capture and positron decay rates for proton rich nuclei in the mass range a=81 - 110 , as well as a discussion of some peculiarities of the weak rates in the _ rp-_process environment , will be presented in another paper ( pruet and fuller , in preparation ) .    the formidable task of calculating the electron and positron capture and emission rates in the conditions characteristic of these astrophysical environments has received more than four decades of attention .",
    "the first self consistent calculations to include the effects of the fermi and gamow - teller ( gt ) resonances as well as the thermal population of these resonances for a broad range of nuclei and thermodynamic conditons were done by @xcite ( hereafter ffn ) , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "ffn presented a physically intuitive and computationally tractable method for determining the strength and excitation energy of the fermi and gt resonances .",
    "the groundwork for the treatment of these resonances in a thermal environment was laid down by @xcite and ffnii .",
    "the importance of first forbidden transitions , blocking , and thermal unblocking for the very neutron rich nuclei present during collapse was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated electron capture rates for these nuclei by estimating the parity forbidden matrix elements as well as the effects of thermal unblocking of the allowed @xmath2 strength .",
    "the last two decades have seen a great increase in our understanding of weak interaction systematics in intermediate mass nuclei .",
    "there are now semi - direct measurements of the gt strength distribution for roughly 40 nuclei from forward angle ( n , p ) and ( p , n ) scattering experiments .",
    "there are also shell model calculations for the strength distribution for some 400 nuclei in the fp shell @xcite , as well as a number of rpa and qrpa calculations of the gt resonance in heavier nuclei .",
    "one consequence of these studies is that the ffn prescription misses some important systematics in the assigning the centroid of the gt resonance .",
    "the influence of this misassignment on the rates was discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( hereafter lmp ) .",
    "@xcite also provided updated calculations of the rates for a@xmath3 65 based on large scale shell model calculations .",
    "we attempt to remedy the misassignment of the gt centroids .",
    "other than this and a different treatment of high temperature partition functions , our strategy for calculating weak rates for a@xmath465 is essentially the ffn approach . in this approach",
    "the rates are broken into two pieces : a low part consisting of discrete transitions between individual levels , and a high part involving the fermi and gt resonances .",
    "this approach is valid provided that discrete transitions between high lying levels never dominant the rates .",
    "in addition , available experimental information for @xmath5 values and level energies , parities , and spins is used .",
    "the inclusion of this much data for more than a hundred nuclei is a difficult task , and would not be possible without the web - based nuclear structure databases ( in particular those provided by nudat and the table of isotopes ) .",
    "the simple ffn approach for estimating weak rates may be the most natural framework for incorporating experimentally - determined nuclear properties .",
    "additionally , a virtue of using this semi - empirical schematic approach is that we can easily see where the key nuclear uncertainties are .",
    "our work can then serve as a catalyst for more detailed follow up nuclear structure studies for important rates .    in the next section we present a discussion of the formalism for calculating weak rates . in section iii",
    "we discuss the assignment of experimentally unknown matrix elements for allowed , discrete state transitions .",
    "this discussion is based on the systematics of experimentally observed weak transitions . in section",
    "iv we present a simple approach for estimating the position of the gt resonances and make some comparison with data and shell model calculations .",
    "the calculation of rates in a high temperature environment is treated in section v. we also discuss in section v some subtleties associated with the proper partition function to be used in these calculations .",
    "section vi gives some comparisons of our estimates for the rates with those provided by langanke and martinez - pinedo .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of the results .",
    "the total decay rate for a nucleus in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath6 is given by a sum over initial parent states @xmath7 and final parent states @xmath8 ; @xmath9 where the population factor for a parent state @xmath7 with excitation energy @xmath10 and angular momentum @xmath11 is @xmath12 with @xmath13 the nuclear partition function .",

    "the phase space factors for @xmath22 decay are @xmath23 and for electron / positron capture are @xmath24 where the upper(lower ) signs are for electrons(positrons ) , @xmath25 , and where @xmath26 is the nuclear mass of the parent and @xmath27 is the nuclear mass of the daughter .",
    "the threshold is @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the lepton occupation factors are @xmath32^{-1}\\ ] ] where the ( - ) sign is for electrons , the ( + ) sign is for positrons , @xmath33 is the electron kinetic energy and @xmath34 the kinetic chemical potential ( total chemical potential is here defined to include the electron rest mass ) .",
    "the factor @xmath35 is the coulomb wave correction factor defined in terms of the fermi factor f @xmath36 as discussed in ffni .",
    "as in ffn , we break the rates @xmath14 into two distinct components : non - resonant discrete transitions between low lying levels , and transitions involving resonance states carrying total weak strength ( @xmath37 ) of order one or greater .",
    "discrete state transitions between low lying states in the parent and daughter are important when the capturing lepton energies are too low to reach resonance states in the daughter , or when the temperature is too low to thermally populate parent levels with fast transitions to daughter states . to estimate matrix elements between low lying parent and daughter levels ,",
    "ffn adopted the simple prescription that all transitions not forbidden by the selection rules have some average matrix element characteristic of a group of nuclei .",
    "the validity of this approach can be addressed by looking at the systematics of matrix elements for experimentally observed @xmath38/ec and @xmath39 decays .",
    "figures [ char1 ] , [ char2 ] , and [ char3 ] show the characteristic @xmath5 value for all nuclei in the mass range a=65 - 80 for which there is experimentally - determined weak decay information . by `` characteristic @xmath5 '' we mean here the @xmath5 value obtained by assuming that all of the measured discrete strength is spread uniformly over all states in the daughter for which the selection rules do not forbid a transition and for which the q - value is positive .",
    "this estimated number of allowed transitions ( @xmath40 ) for each nucleus is shown on the x axis .",
    "the determination of @xmath41 is difficult because of uncertainties in the angular momentum and spin assignments of levels .",
    "where the angular momentum of a given level is uncertain we have adopted the middle value if more than two possibilities are listed , and the largest value if only two possibilities are given . where the parity is listed , but uncertain , we have adopted the tentative value .",
    "transitions involving a level for which no spin or parity information is given are labelled as forbidden .    for illustration ,",
    "consider the @xmath42 decay of @xmath43 .",
    "experimentally it is observed that @xmath44 decays in this channel to two states in @xmath45 , one with a @xmath5 of 4.21 and the other with @xmath464.75 . by examining the experimentally studied levels in @xmath45",
    "it is seen that there are 7 levels that have spins and parities consistent with allowed decay from @xmath44 .",
    "the characteristic @xmath5 for @xmath44 is then defined as @xmath47 .",
    "our definition of the characteristic @xmath5 is rough in that it neglects the experimental difficulties associated with measuring weak transitions . in particular ,",
    "uncertainties arising from the possibility of the feeding of daughter states from higher lying states has not been accounted for , nor has the difficulty of observing near - threshold transitions .",
    "nonethless , a case may be made from these figures that the assumption of an average matrix element is a reasonable one , particularly when several transitions are involved .",
    "for example , for nuclei with @xmath48 , only one nucleus with @xmath49 has a characteristic @xmath5 differing from 5.4 by more than 1 , and for nuclei in the range @xmath50 only 5 nuclei with @xmath51 have a characteristic @xmath5 differing from 5.7 by more than 1 .    in this work",
    "we take a characteristic @xmath5 of 5.4 for nuclei with a@xmath5270 , and a characteristic @xmath5 of 5.7 for nuclei with a@xmath470 .",
    "an alternative approach for estimating these matrix elements would be to assign @xmath5 s from a statistical distribution .",
    "our procedure should give a reasonable estimate of the rates when several transitions contribute nearly equally to the rate .",
    "however , our estimated rate is obviously subject to uncertainty when only one or two experimentally unknown transitions dominate .",
    "an important class of such nuclei are the proton - rich even - even nuclei with nearly closed neutron and proton sub - shells .",
    "these can have anomolously large @xmath53 gt transitions . in x - ray burst environments , with temperatures @xmath54 , the first @xmath55 excited state in these nuclei is thermally populated .",
    "the thermal @xmath38 decay rate of the nucleus depends sensitively on whether this @xmath55 state also decays with anomolously large matrix elements .",
    "@xcite studied this question for a number of proton - rich nuclei and found that the @xmath55 state decays more rapidly than the ground state when the ground state decays quickly .",
    "we incorporate the results of the schatz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shell model study for the four nuclei ( @xmath56 ) with fast @xmath57 transitions . for these nuclei",
    "we assume that the first @xmath55 state has a strength distribution identical in shape , but with matrix elements twice as large , as the strength distribution from the @xmath58 ground state .",
    "this gives decay rates within @xmath59 of those calculated by scahtz et al ..",
    "the fermi resonance @xmath60 corresponding to a given state @xmath61 is generated by application of the isospin raising or lowering operator , @xmath62 ( eq . [ fermi ] ) .",
    "the selection rules for fermi transitions are @xmath63 . because @xmath64 and because the ground state of a nucleus generally has the lowest possible isospin , there typically is only non - zero fermi strength for transitions from a nucleus with greater isospin @xmath65 to a nucleus with lesser or equal isospin @xmath66 .",
    "since the nuclear part of the hamiltonian ( @xmath67 ) is isospin independent and the electromagnetic part is small in comparison , the resonance generated by @xmath68 is narrowly concentrated about the ias .",
    "the excitation energy can be estimated from the difference in coulomb binding energy of the parent and daughter nucleus .",
    "ffni gives a useful approximation for the excitation energy of the ias in the daughter nucleus : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the nuclear radius in fm , p and d refer to the parent and daughter , respectively , @xmath71 is the atomic mass excess .",
    "the upper signs in the above equation correspond to @xmath72 transitions for neutron rich parents , while the lower signs correspond to @xmath73 transitions for proton rich parents .",
    "[ ias ] agrees well with measured and shell model predictions for ias energies .",
    "the gamow - teller operator is @xmath74 where the sum is over all nucleons @xmath75 .",
    "the collective gt resonance state @xmath76 corresponding to a given parent state @xmath61 is given by application of the gt operator , @xmath77 .",
    "the selection rules for gt transitions are @xmath78 , @xmath79 no @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the gt strength distribution is harder to characterize because @xmath67 is strongly spin dependent .",
    "since @xmath82\\neq0 $ ] , the gt strength can be fragmented over many daughter states .",
    "however , in practice the stellar weak rates are usually determined by the total strength and the centroid of the strength in excitation energy ( provided that low lying discrete transitions are well accounted for ) .",
    "the strength in the gt resonance was also estimated by ffn in a zeroth order shell model picture . in this picture",
    "the lowest shell orbitals are filled with nucleons , and the total strength is taken to be the sum of the contributions from each pair of single particle orbitals :    @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the number of particles and holes in these orbitals , and @xmath85 is the single particle matrix element connecting the initial and final states .",
    "these single particle matrix elements can be found from angular momentum considerations and are shown in table 1 of ffnii .",
    "we follow ffn in using the single particle result ( eq . [ spstrength ] ) to estimate the total strength .",
    "experimentally it is well established that the axial vector current is renormalized by a factor of @xmath86 in nuclei .",
    "this results in a strength a factor of @xmath87 smaller than shell model calculations give .",
    "in addition , shell model calculations show that residual interaction - induced particle - hole correlations further reduce the total strength by a factor of one to a few . typically , these correlations are more important for @xmath2 transitions , so that the additional quenching is larger for these transitions .",
    "we adopt a quenching factor of 4 for @xmath2 transitions and 3 for @xmath88 transitions .",
    "these values for the quenching factors generally give strengths within a factor of two of more detailed strength determinations . when the quenched value for the strength is less than one , we assign a configuration mixing strength of one . as discussed below ,",
    "this is roughly consistent with the results of ( n , p ) experiments for @xmath2 blocked nuclei .",
    "ffn estimated the centroid of the gt resonance by considering a zeroth order shell model description for the spin flip part of the gt resonance .",
    "this configuration was compared with the zeroth order shell model description of the daughter ground state and assigned an excitation energy @xmath89    here @xmath90 is the difference in single particle energies between the two states ( daughter ground state and spin flip gt resonance state ) , @xmath91 accounts for the difference in pairing energy between the two states , and @xmath92 ( taken to be 2 mev ) accounts for the effects of configuration mixing and particle hole repulsion . for @xmath93 transitions the energy of the ias in the daughter is added to eq .",
    "[ egteqn ] .    for the assignment of the gt centroids",
    "we adopt a procedure close to that outlined by ffn .",
    "however , as noted in the introduction , the ffn approach misses some important systematics in the centroids of the strengths as revealed by more recent experimental data and shell model calculations .",
    "one potential remedy for this is to do rpa or qrpa calculations for the strength distributions for nuclei too heavy to be studied via detailed shell model calculations .",
    "such calculations have been done for a number of nuclei by several different groups .",

    "[ backrate2 ] is that if all of the q - values for the n states are comparable , then @xmath174 independent of n. here the relation @xmath175 ( where @xmath164 is the rate of decay calculated assuming that the gt resonances are confined to single states ) holds because the total strength in the gt resonance is independent of the number of states it is spread over . in a sense eq . [ eq24 ] is counterintuitive because one might expect that if the strength is spread out over n states in the parent , the decay rate from the parent should be a factor of 1/n smaller .",
    "however , in some cases the strength distributions arising from different states in the daughter must overlap ( i.e. correspond to identical states in the parent ) to the extent that the level densities in the parent and in the daughter are comparable .",
    "this is accounted for by the ratio of partition functions appearing in eq .",
    "[ backrate2 ] .    in principal , the back resonance contribution to the rates could be calculated through a direct ( e.g. , shell model ) calculation of the strength distribution from the daughter states . in practice",
    "this approach is not feasible because such a calculation would have to have fully converged final states corresponding to the strength distribution from many daughter states in order to distinguish which ones are identical .",
    "otherwise , an overcounting of the partition function results , and the final rate estimate is a function of how many lanczos iterations are done .",
    "this line of reasoning indicates that at high temperatures the current shell model - based calculations could systematically underestimate the contribution to the @xmath42 decay rates from the decay of the thermally populated @xmath2 resonance states by up to an order of magnitude . to show this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ comparehigh ] a comparison between our calculated @xmath39 decay rates and those of lmp at a temperature of @xmath176 and a density of @xmath177 .",
    "these thermodynamic conditions are artificial , but serve the purpose of illustration .",
    "when the @xmath42 decay rate is fast ( and insensitive to the finer details of the strength distribution ) , the discrepancy between the two calculations is about a factor of 10 .",
    "this is roughly the number of independent lanczos states carrying strength per daughter state in the calculations of lmp . from our simple analysis",
    "it is nt clear that either set of rates is more reliable .",
    "however , it is clear that differences in treatments of the partition functions can result in significant differences in estimates of the rates .",
    "the trend of greater disagreement with faster decay rate seen in fig . [ comparehigh ] arises from the competition of two factors . for low decay rates ,",
    "the q - value of the decay ( excitation energy of the @xmath2 resonance with respect to the daughter ground state ) , is typically small . in this case",
    "the width of the resonance enhances the decay rate compared to the decay rate calculated from our artificially narrow resonance . for faster decay rates , the q - value is large",
    ", the lifetime is relatively insensitive to the width of the resonance , and the lanczos - based calculation rate estimate is simply suppressed by the overestimate of the parent partition function .",
    "the effect , and the importance of consistency in partition functions in general , can be illustrated by considering the conditions in the post - silicon burning , pre - collapse core of a massive star . there",
    "electron capture proceeds on iron peak nuclei , driving them to a neutron excess where `` reverse '' @xmath39 decay balances `` forward '' electron capture .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xcite identify @xmath178 as the endpoint nucleus where the forward and reverse neutronization rates balance . in balanced conditions , partition functions are crucial rate and abundance determinants .",
    "we can compare our rates with lmp as in fig .",
    "[ comparehigh ] , but now for @xmath179 , @xmath180 , roughly approximating immediately pre - collapse conditions .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ comparelow ] .",
    "again there is a systematic trend : the lmp rates are lower than ours by a factor of 4 on average with a fair scatter .",
    "this is smaller than the disagreement presented above for the fastest @xmath42 decay rates , but still of potential significance given the dependence of the initial @xmath181 core mass on the electron fraction .",
    "part of the discrepancy between the rate estimates undoubtedly stems from differences in placement and width of gt strength and other nuclear uncertainties .",
    "however , the partition effect outlined above likely plays a role as well .",
    "in fact , these conitions ( @xmath179 , @xmath182 ) are electron degenerate with fermi energies @xmath183 , precluding significant @xmath42 decay for all but the nuclear decay pairs with relatively large q - values , just those where we argued that the partition function - based uncertainties in rate estimates could be large .    in evaluating the ratio @xmath184 in eq .",
    "[ backrate2 ] we use the compilation of partition functions from @xcite .",
    "these partition functions include experimentally - determined low lying levels and are supplemented at higher excitation energies by a level density calculated from a back shifted fermi gas formula . at low temperatures",
    "the partition functions of @xcite agree well with the partition functions we calculate for evaluating the rates between low lying levels . for temperatures above 2 mev",
    "we take @xmath185 .",
    "this is valid because the mean excitation energy at these temperatures is well above the pairing gap .",
    "we do not claim that our partition function treatment is necessarily better than others , and it may well be inadequate in some conditions .",
    "in fact there is a basic inconsistency in our rates : we include many states in our partition function sums for which we include no weak interaction strength",
    ". ideally we should include all states and all associated weak strength : only fully converged lanczos and monte carlo calculations of weak strength and partition functions currently do this .",
    "failing to estimate partition functions and strength functions consistently can lead to inaccurate predictions of final @xmath186 parameters . in equilibrium ,",
    "the hard won rates no longer matter and only the partition functions govern the final quantities of interest ( @xmath187 , abundances , etc . ) .",
    "here we address the reliability of our calculated rates .",
    "we have shown in section 3 that with a simple prescription some gross features of the strength distribution , in particular the total strength and centroid of the distribution , may be estimated . however ,",
    "shell model and experimental results typically show a rich structure in the strength distribution , with this structure varying markedly from nucleus to nucleus ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "do the rates depend sensitively on the finer features of the strength distribution ? or , alternatively , can a computationally simple method give a good estimate of the weak interaction rates ?",
    "these questions can be addressed by comparing our relatively simply derived rates with rates based on more detailed large dimension shell model calculations .    in figures",
    "[ comp1 ] and [ comp2 ] we show the log of the ratio of our calculated beta decay rates to those calculated in @xcite at several temperature / density points relevant for stellar collapse , and for all nuclei in the range a=60 - 65 for which lmp calculated rates .",
    "the horizontal axis in this figure is the log of the beta decay rate calculated by lmp .",
    "we have presented the comparison in this way because nuclei with very small rates will not be so important in determining the evolution .",
    "the comparison is generally remarkably favorable , with typical results differing by less than a factor of two .",
    "figures [ comp4],[comp5 ] and [ comp6 ] are the same as the previous three figures , but now electron capture rates are being compared . again , the comparison is favorable , the rates as calculated in the two schemes being within a factor of three or so .",
    "this is surprising given the potential sensitivity of electron capture rates to the placement and the width of the gamow - teller distribution .",
    "the fact that a simple prescription and rough estimates of the strength do a reasonably good job in getting the rates relevant for stellar collapse is not to say that all rates are accurately determined at all temperatures and densities with a simple model . some of our calculated rates deviate significantly from more detailed calculations .",
    "this typically occurs for @xmath188 decay when thermal population of the states in a collective gamow - teller resonance results in an exponential sensitivity , or for lepton capture when the maximum lepton energies are just on the edge of being able to reach the resonance in the daughter .",
    "typically this exponential sensitivity is accompanied by a very small rate , so that it is not very important for stellar evolution .",
    "x - ray bursts arise from the thermonuclear burning of hydrogen and helium accreted onto the surface of a neutron star in a binary system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "characteristic temperatures during burning are a few hundred kev , and characteristic densities are @xmath189 .",
    "the creation of nuclei heavier than @xmath190 occurs via the _ rp-_process , in which nuclei undergo @xmath191 reactions until they approach the proton drip line and/or @xmath192 decay intervenes .",
    "the time for burning along the _",
    "rp-_process path is set to some extent by the @xmath193ec lifetime of a few important waiting point nuclei .",
    "here we present a few examples of important rates .",
    "three important waiting point nuclei with a@xmath5280 are the even - even ( proton bound ) nuclei @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 @xcite .",
    "for each of these nuclei the single proton capture daughter ( z+1,n ) is unbound , while the next heaviest isotone ( z+2,n ) is bound . at low temperatures @xmath197 the weak rate most important for determining flow towards the valley of @xmath42 stability",
    "is @xmath198(z , n ) . for higher temperatures an equilibrium between ( z , n ) and ( z+2,n )",
    "is reached , so that @xmath199 is also important . as a typical example",
    "we discuss @xmath200 and it s two - proton capture daughter @xmath201 .",
    "the first @xmath55 excited state of @xmath196 lies at @xmath202 and is not significantly populated for temperatures @xmath203 .",
    "the ground state lifetime of @xmath196 is experimentally - determined .",
    "the low lying strength distribution in the daughter ( @xmath204 ) has also been measured . with the ground state lifetime and low lying strength distribution measured",
    ", the only missing piece of information is the strength distribution at excitation energies too high to be experimentally observed .",
    "our rough estimate ( eq . [ rpaplus ] ) places a sizable portion of the resonance strength within the q - value window for the decay . in order not to conflict with the experimentally - determined lifetime",
    "we push this strength up to q=0 in our calculation .    to quantify the uncertainty in the rates arising from the high lying resonance strength we plot in fig . [ kr72.eps ] the total rate ( @xmath205 ) for @xmath196 . also included in this figure",
    "is the fraction of the total rate coming from q=0 and above .",
    "the figure shows that the experimentally - determined lifetime is sufficient for a determination of the thermal decay rate at the @xmath206 level for @xmath207 . at @xmath208 ,",
    "our simple estimate shows the high lying strength accounting for @xmath209 of the total weak rate .",
    "because our method puts essentially all of the strength at q=0 , and very little above q=0 , it is unlikely that we have underestimated the contribution to the rate from the high lying resonance strength .",
    "the decay of @xmath210 is more easily calculated because the ground state ( or a low lying excited state ) of the odd - odd n = z daughter ( @xmath211 ) is the ias of the ground state of @xmath210 .",
    "the large matrix element and q - value ( @xmath212 ) for the fermi decay mean that electron capture can not compete with @xmath38 decay in x - ray burst conditions for this case .",
    "it is difficult to reliably estimate the contribution to the @xmath38 rate from @xmath2 transitions , but a reasonable estimate is that the diffuse @xmath2 strength only decreases the ground state lifetime by at most @xmath213",
    ".    by mirror symmetry , a low lying thermally populated state of @xmath211 corresponds to the ias of the next even - even @xmath38 nucleus ( @xmath214 ) , so that the chain @xmath215 is fast and dominated by fermi transitions .",
    "the decay of the odd - odd n = z nucleus ( @xmath211 in this example ) should is calculated as the decay of a thermally populated back resonance as discussed above .",
    "this is because only those parent states with an ias in the even - even daughter nucleus decay via the fermi transition .",
    "since the partition function of the odd - odd parent increases more rapidly with temperature than the partition function of the even - even daughter , the decay rate decreases rapidly with increasing temperature .",
    "another set of nuclei important for the _ rp_-process with decays dominated by the fermi transitions are those nuclei with @xmath216 .",
    "these have an ias near or at the ground state of the @xmath217 daughter .    generally , for a given ground state lifetime , the electron capture rate is small and insensitive to the placement of strength within the q - value window as long as the initial state electron energy is small compared to the energy of the decay , i.e. @xmath218 in the x - ray burst environment @xmath219 , while the q - values for the proton - rich nuclei are typically greater than @xmath220 , so the thermal lifetime is reliably estimated from the ground state lifetime . by contrast ,",
    "nuclei closer to the valley of stability have smaller q - values and therefore the lifetimes are nearly entirely determined by thermal electron capture .",
    "for example , consider @xmath221 , a nucleus important in steady state burning on and/or near neutron star surfaces .",
    "this nucleus has a q - value of only @xmath2222 mev and a fair portion of the strength lies at the upper end of the q - value window .",
    "consequently thermal electron capture dominates over positron decay for @xmath223 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ 66ge.fig ] .      here",
    "we discuss some of the systematics of the weak rates in the hot and electron - degenerate core during the @xmath224s before core bounce .",
    "most of the nuclei with a@xmath22565 present in the core will be blocked or nearly blocked to @xmath226 transitions in the zeroth order shell model picture .",
    "our calculation of the electron capture rates for these nuclei is based on an estimate of the @xmath226 configuration mixing strength . forbidden transitions and transitions allowed by the thermal unblocking of strength",
    "will also contribute to the electron capture rates .",
    "it is useful to estimate how large the configuration mixing strength must be in order to justify the neglect of these latter types of transitions .",
    "thermal unblocking refers to the population of parent excited states that have zeroth order shell model configurations consistent with allowed transitions to states in the daughter .",
    "assume that these parent states comprise a fraction @xmath227 of the total partition function .",

    "@xmath229 is a typical single particle allowed transition matrix element .",
    "an accurate estimate of @xmath227 is very difficult and an important open issue .",
    "fuller 1982 parametrizes @xmath230 , with @xmath231 the excitation energy of the lowest parent excited state with an allowed @xmath226 transition in the zeroth order shell model picture . with this schematic notation ,",
    "thermal unblocking can compete with a configuration mixing strength of @xmath232 if @xmath233 .",
    "for a typical @xmath234 , then , thermal unblocking can be neglected for @xmath235 .",
    "for @xmath236 the thermal population of the @xmath237 resonance states ( which we do include in our calculations ) also becomes important .",
    "forbidden transitions become important as the electron chemical potential increases and the wavelength of the leptons involved in an electron capture event become small enough to probe structure in the nucleus . again following the convention of fuller 1982",
    ", the contribution to the electron capture rate from forbidden transitions can be written as @xmath238 . here",
    "@xmath239 is roughly the number of protons in the fp shell multiplied by a typical single particle first forbidden matrix element .",

    "forbidden transitions compete with a low lying configuration mixing strength of @xmath245 for @xmath246 if @xmath247 .",
    "if the centroid of the forbidden strength lies instead at @xmath248 above the daughter ground state , then forbidden transitions do not become important until @xmath249 .    with the assumption that the high density electron capture rates are dominated by transitions involving low - lying configuration mixing strength , these rates are trivial functions of the electron fermi energy and the parent - daughter mass difference .",
    "this is shown in figure [ highufec ] where the electron capture rates are presented for all nuclei with ( n - z)/a@xmath2250.1 that fall in the mass range a@xmath25066 - 80 .",

    "this equation assumes that @xmath256 is negative .",

    "electron capture rates for neutron rich nuclei at high electron fermi energies are essentially a function of only 1 parameter , the total @xmath226 strength within a few mev of the daughter state . discrepancies between our calculated rates and more detailed calculations , e.g. monte carlo+rpa calculations @xcite , reflect the difference between our adopted @xmath259 and the more detailed estimate of @xmath261 .",
    "[ highufec ] also gives an estimate of the uncertainties in the electron capture rates . at @xmath179 , @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) , an error of 2 mev in the position of the centroid of the strength results in a change in the rate by a factor of @xmath264 for the nuclei with the smallest rates , and a factor of @xmath265 for the nuclei with the largest rates . at @xmath179 , @xmath266 ( @xmath267 ) ,",
    "the uncertainty in the placement of the centroid implies an error of at most a factor of two in the electron capture rate .",
    "the uncertainty in the total strength is probably about a factor of 2 on average .",

    "this can be understood by noting that at @xmath179 the @xmath2 resonance is thermally populated ( under our assumption that the strength is centered at 2 mev for these blocked nuclei ) . in this case",
    "the rate of decay is approximately @xmath270 , where @xmath271 has a simple dependence on the q - value .",
    "for even - even parents , @xmath272 is typically approximately 20 at @xmath179 , for odd - odd parents the ratio is about @xmath273 , and for odd - even / even - odd parents the ratio of partition functions is about 1 .",
    "note that the @xmath42 decay rates are more sensitive to the ( unknown ) details of the strength distribution than the electron capture rates . at @xmath179 , an error in the placement of the centroid of the resonance of 2 mev",
    "changes the beta decay rate by about an order of magnitude .",
    "we have provided estimates of weak interaction rates for nuclei in the mass range a=65 - 80 .",
    "these may be useful in simulations of x - ray bursts and pre - supernova stellar evolution .",
    "the rates have been calculated using available experimental information and simple estimates for the strength distributions and matrix elements for allowed and discrete - state transitions .",
    "the efficacy of our approach is confirmed through comparisons with detailed shell model based rates for nuclei in the mass range 60 - 65 .",
    "the single most uncertain aspect of the rate calculations is the @xmath274 resonance strength distribution .",

    "fortunately , nature to some extent does not seem to care about some of the hard to get details of the strength distribution for these nuclei . in the pre - collapse supernova",
    "this is because the nuclei present are nearly blocked to @xmath226 transitions .",

    "special care is needed in evaluating the partition functions for these rates .",
