    "the recent explosion in the study of complex networks of dynamical systems  @xcite has provided compeling evidence that the synchronization of coupled oscillators is drastically influenced by the structure of the underlying network of couplings  @xcite .",
    "previous works on synchronization have focused mainly on the influence of the topology of the connections by assuming that the coupling strength is uniform .",
    "these works have shown that the ability to synchronize is generally enhanced in both small - world networks ( swns ) @xcite and random scale - free networks ( sfns ) @xcite as compared to regular networks @xcite , indicating that synchronizability is strongly related to the average distance between oscillators .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that synchronizability also depends critically on the heterogeneity of the degree distribution and that this can lead to counter - intuitive behaviors @xcite .",
    "in particular , random networks with strong heterogeneity in the degree distribution , such as sfns , are more difficult to synchronize than random homogeneous networks @xcite , despite the fact that heterogeneity reduces the average distance between nodes @xcite",
    ".    however , synchronization , as many other dynamical processes , is influenced not only by the topology , but also by the strength of the connections .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that synchronization is suppressed in networks with heterogenous distribution of weights in the connection strengths @xcite , even when the distribution of degrees is homogeneous .",
    "this is an important result because most complex networks where synchronization is relevant are indeed weighted and display a highly heterogeneous distribution of both degrees _ and _ weights  @xcite .",
    "examples include brain networks , both at the neuronal and cortical level  @xcite , and airport networks  @xcite , which underlie the synchronization of epidemic outbreaks in different cities  @xcite .",
    "the identification and study of complex weighted networks with improved synchronization properties is thus of great interest .    in this paper",
    ", we review this fundamental problem in the context of complete synchronization of identical oscillators  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a weighted coupling scheme and we show that , for a given network topology , the synchronizability is maximum when the network of couplings is weighted and directed . for large sufficiently random networks ,",
    "the maximum synchronizability is primarily determined by the mean degree of the network and does not depend on the degree distribution and system size .",
    "this contrasts with the case of unweighted ( and undirected ) coupling , where the synchronizability is strongly suppressed as the degree heterogeneity or number of oscillators is increased .",
    "we also show that the total cost involved in the weighted couplings is significantly reduced as compared to the case of unweighted coupling and appears to be minimum when the synchronizability is maximum .",
    "furthermore , we present new results that extend our findings to the synchronization of phase oscillators and provide evidence for the optimality of our weighted model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the problem of complete synchronization is formulated in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] and is analyzed in sec .",
    "the problem of phase synchronization is considered in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] . in sec .",
    "[ s5 ] , we discuss the distribution of weights that would maximize synchronizability for a given network topology .",
    "the conclusions are presented in the last section .",
    "we introduce a weighted model of linearly coupled identical oscillators and we present a condition for the linear stability of the completely synchronized states in terms of the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix .",
    "the dynamics of a weighted network of @xmath0 identical oscillators is described by : @xmath1,\\label{eq1}\\\\           & = & { \\bf f}({\\bf x}_i)-\\sigma\\sum_{j=1}^{n}g_{ij } { \\bf h}({\\bf x}_j ) , \\;\\;\\ ; i=1,\\ldots , n ,   \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 governs the dynamics of each individual oscillator , @xmath3 is the output function , and @xmath4 is the overall coupling strength .",

    "matrix @xmath11 , defined as @xmath12 , is the coupling matrix .",
    "the rows of matrix @xmath13 have zero sum and this ensures that the completely synchronized state @xmath14 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .    in the case of symmetrically coupled oscillators with uniform coupling strength , the network of couplings is unweighted and undirected , and @xmath13 is the usual ( symmetric ) laplacian matrix @xmath15 : the diagonal entries are @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the degree of node @xmath9 , and the off - diagonal entries are @xmath18 if nodes @xmath9 and @xmath8 are connected and @xmath19 otherwise .",
    "for @xmath20 , heterogeneity in the degree distribution suppresses synchronization in important classes of networks @xcite .",
    "the synchronizability may be easily enhanced if we modify the topology of the network of couplings . here ,",
    "however , we address the problem of enhancement of synchronizability for a _ given _ network topology .    in order to enhance the synchronizability of networks with heterogeneous degree distribution",
    ", we propose to scale the coupling strength by a function of the degree of the nodes . for specificity , we take @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a tunable parameter .",

    "[ figi](a ) and [ figi](b ) , respectively .",
    "the underlying network associated with the laplacian matrix @xmath26 is undirected and unweighted , but for @xmath23 , the network of couplings becomes not only weighted but also directed because the resulting matrix @xmath13 is in general asymmetric .",
    "this is a special kind of directed network where the number of _ in_-links is equal to the number of _ out_-links in each node , and the directions are encoded in the strengths of in- and out - links [ fig .",
    "[ figi](b ) ] . in spite of the possible asymmetry of matrix @xmath13 , all the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath13",
    "are nonnegative reals and can be ordered as @xmath27 , as shown below .    in matrix notation , eq .  ( [ eq2 ] ) can be written as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 diag@xmath30 is the diagonal matrix of degrees .",
    "( we recall that the degree @xmath17 is the number of oscillators coupled to oscillator @xmath9 . ) from the identity @xmath31 , valid for any @xmath32 , we have that the spectrum of eigenvalues of matrix @xmath13 is equal to the spectrum of a symmetric matrix defined as @xmath33 . as a result ,",

    "( [ eq15 ] ) will be synchronized by the common forcing when @xmath62 for @xmath63 , it is enough to have a single node with degree very different from the others for this condition not to be satisfied for any @xmath4 . in this case",
    ", the complete synchronization becomes impossible because the corresponding oscillator can not be synchronized .",
    "this explains the results of ref .",
    "@xcite on the suppression of synchronizability due to heterogeneity in unweighted networks .    within the mean field approximation ,",
    "the eigenratio is @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and reaches its minimum at @xmath37 .",
    "this suggests that the maximum synchronizability in weighted networks is achieved when @xmath37 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same indication is provided by the analysis of a diffusion process related to the spread of information in the network .",

    "we discard the networks that are not connected . in the limit @xmath74",

    "our numerical computations confirm that the eigenratio @xmath56 has a well defined minimum at @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for various @xmath72 .",
    "the only exception is the class of homogeneous networks , where all the nodes have the same degree . when the network is homogeneous , the weights @xmath76 can be factored out and the eigenratio @xmath56 is independent of @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , solid line ) .",
    "random homogeneous networks correspond to random sfns with @xmath74 . in sfns ,",

    "these results are rigorous for ensembles of networks with a given expected degree sequence and sufficiently large minimum degree @xmath73 , but our numerical computation supports the hypothesis that the approximate relations @xmath80 hold under much milder conditions . in particular , relations ( [ eq25 ] ) are expected to hold true for any large , sufficiently random network with @xmath81 .    under the assumption that @xmath82 , the eigenratio can be written as @xmath83 therefore , for @xmath37 , the eigenratio @xmath56 is primarily determined by the mean degree and does not depend on the number of oscillators and the details of the degree distribution .",
    "this is a remarkable result because , regardless of the degree distribution , the network at @xmath37 is just as synchronizable as a random homogeneous network with the same mean degree , and random homogeneous networks appear to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that @xmath56 approaches the absolute lower bound in the thermodynamic limit for large enough @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "we now test our predictions on random sfns . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , in unweighted sfns , the eigenratio @xmath56 increases with increasing heterogeneity of the degree distribution ( see also ref .",

    "the difference is particularly large for small scaling exponent @xmath72 , where the variance of the degree distribution is large and the network is highly heterogeneous ( note the logarithmic scale in fig .",

    "the eigenratio of the sfns is also very well approximated by the eigenratio of random homogeneous networks with the same number of links [ fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath37 , the variation of the eigenratio @xmath56 with the heterogeneity of the degree distribution in sfns is mainly due to the variation of the mean degree of the networks , which increases in random sfns as the scaling exponent @xmath72 is reduced .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2.5 ] , we show the eigenratio @xmath56 as a function of the system size @xmath0 .",
    "in unweighted sfns , the eigenratio increases strongly as the number of oscillators is increased .",

    "altogether , these provide strong evidence for relation ( [ eq27 ] ) and shows that synchronizability is significantly enhanced for @xmath37 as compared to the case of unweighted coupling ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we now turn to the problem of the cost involved in the network of couplings .",
    "the total cost @xmath86 is naturally defined as the total input strength of the connections of all nodes at the synchronization threshold : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the minimum coupling strength for the network to synchronize .",
    "we recall that @xmath89 is the point where the master stability function first becomes negative . for @xmath37 , we have @xmath90 .    as a function of @xmath22 ,",
    "the cost has a broad minimum at @xmath37 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for random sfns .",
    "this result is important because it shows that maximum synchronizability and minimum cost occur exactly at the same point .",
    "the cost for random sfns at @xmath37 is very well approximated by the cost for random homogeneous networks with the same mean degree [ fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , @xmath85 , in agreement with our analysis in sec .",
    "[ s4a ] that , at @xmath37 , the eigenvalue @xmath91 is fairly independent of the degree distribution .",
    "the cost at @xmath37 is significantly reduced as compared to the case of unweighted coupling ( @xmath24 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the difference becomes more pronounced when the scaling exponent @xmath72 is reduced and the degree distribution becomes more heterogeneous .",
    "similar results are observed in other models of complex networks .",
    "therefore , cost reduction is another important advantage of suitably weighted networks .",
    "the above analysis on identical oscillators can serve as a good approximation even when the oscillators are not fully identical . in some realistic situations",
    "@xcite , however , the interacting oscillators are significantly different , specially in the oscillation frequencies  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the enhancement of synchronizability to networks of non - identical oscillators .",
    "we consider phase synchronization in complex networks of limit cycle oscillators , @xmath92 where @xmath93 represents a van der pol oscillator , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and the couplings are through both variables @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",

    "now we study the effects of the weighted coupling on phase synchronization . for an arbitrary @xmath22 , on average",
    "each oscillator receives an effective input of strength @xmath102 .",
    "we can compare the synchronization behavior at different @xmath22 for the same effective strength @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "[ fig61 ] , we show time series of the mean field @xmath104 for unweighted ( @xmath24 ) and weighted random sfns ( @xmath37 ) . for small coupling strength @xmath103 ,",
    "neither of the networks display significant collective behavior [ fig .",
    "[ fig61](a ) ] . as the coupling strength",
    "is increased , collective oscillations emerge for both weighted and unweighted networks , but the oscillations are much more pronounced for the networks with @xmath37 [ fig .",
    "[ fig61](b ) ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig62 ] , we show the _ amplitude _ of the mean field @xmath105 as a function of @xmath103 . here",
    "the amplitude is defined as the standard deviation of @xmath105 over time .",
    "the amplitude is approximately zero for small coupling strength , increases sharply as @xmath103 is increased beyond a certain critical value , and saturates for large @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ fig62 ] ) .",
    "( this transition becomes sharper as the number @xmath0 of oscillators is increased ) .",
    "the overall behavior is similar for weighted and unweighted networks but , again , the amplitude is significantly larger for networks with @xmath37 at the same value of @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of random sfns at @xmath37 is well approximated by the amplitude of random homogeneous networks with the same mean degree ( fig .  [ fig62 ] ) , which are networks that exhibit good phase synchronization properties .",
    "all these provide strong evidence that our weighted coupling scheme strongly enhances the synchronizability of networks of non - identical oscillators .",
    "this is expected to be relevant for realistic networks .",
    "within the weighted coupling scheme of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , the networks that exhibit maximum synchronizability and minimum cost are those with @xmath106 ( sec .  [ s3 ] ) .",
    "physically , this seems to be related to the fact that the synchronization of the network is determined by the input signal at each node ( as opposed to the output signal ) and that the sum @xmath107 of the strengths of all the in - links of a node becomes uniformly equal to @xmath78 for all the nodes exactly at @xmath106 .",
    "this leads to the natural question of whether there is any other distribution of weights that can further improve the synchronizability and cost of the network for a given topology of connections . as we show",
    ", the answer is positive for finite size networks , but seems to be negative in the thermodynamic limit .    in order to address this question we introduce the following weighted coupling scheme . if there is a link between a node @xmath9 with degree @xmath17 and a node @xmath8 with degree @xmath108 , the strength @xmath6 of link @xmath109 is taken to be @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a tunable parameter and @xmath112 is a normalization factor that ensures that @xmath113 ( the sum @xmath114 is over all the neighbors of node @xmath9 ) .",
    "for @xmath115 we recover the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "this new weighted model is partially motivated by observations in real networks , including scientific collaboration networks  @xcite , airport networks  @xcite , and metabolic networks  @xcite , which have been found to exhibit a strong correlation between the weight @xmath116 and product of the corresponding degrees as @xmath117 .",
    "a similar model has been considered in the study of coherence in networks of chaotic maps @xcite .",
    "we now study the weighted model ( [ neq1 ] ) numerically in the context of complete synchronization of identical oscillators . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we show the eigenratio @xmath56 and the normalized cost @xmath118 as functions of @xmath111 for different values of the scaling exponent . in each case , both the eigenratio and the cost reach a minimum for some @xmath119 , which is approximately the same for @xmath56 and @xmath86 and indicates that these networks synchronize better than those of the weighted model  ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath37 ( @xmath120 ) . however , as compared to the difference between unweighted networks @xmath121 and networks weighted for @xmath37 in model  ( [ eq2 ] ) , the further reduction of @xmath56 and @xmath86 within model  ( [ neq1 ] ) is very small .    indeed ,",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath123 [ fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ] are orders of magnitude larger than @xmath124 and @xmath125 [ fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ] , even when the networks are strongly heterogeneous ( i.e. , @xmath72 is small ) .",
    "moreover , the difference between the synchronizability at @xmath120 and @xmath126 reduces when the number @xmath0 of oscillators is increased , as shown in fig .",
    "since @xmath127 approaches @xmath120 for increasing @xmath0 , our numerics are consistent with the hypothesis that the minimum of @xmath56 and @xmath86 will be at @xmath120 for @xmath128 .",
    "that is , the weighted model  ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath37 may be optimal in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the verification of this hypothesis is currently an interesting open problem . +",
    "complex networks with strong heterogeneity in the distributions of either degrees or weights are poorly synchronizable .",
    "this suppression of synchronizability is due to the different intensities of the input signals received by different nodes in the network .",
    "we have shown that the synchronizability is significantly improved when the distribution of weights is constrained by the distribution of degrees in such a way that all the nodes receive the same intensity of input signal . in this case , the distributions of degrees and weights as well as the distribution of the total strength of out - links per node , @xmath129 , may be highly heterogenous , but the distribution of the total strength of in - links , @xmath130 , is the same for all the nodes in the network .",
    "in particular , our analysis shows that properly weighted complex networks are much more synchronizable than the corresponding unweighted networks .",

    "<S> most real - world networks display not only a heterogeneous distribution of degrees , but also a heterogeneous distribution of weights in the strengths of the connections . </S>",
    "<S> each of these heterogeneities alone has been shown to suppress synchronization in random networks of dynamical systems . here </S>",
    "<S> we review our recent findings that complete synchronization is significantly enhanced and becomes independent of both distributions when the distribution of weights is suitably combined with the distribution of degrees . </S>",
    "<S> we also present new results addressing the optimality of our findings and extending our analysis to phase synchronization in networks of non - identical dynamical units .    </S>",
