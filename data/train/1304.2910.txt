    "no physical process can copy arbitrary quantum states on demand @xcite : if such a process existed , we could build a device that distinguishes quantum states with arbitrary precision , violating the uncertainty principle and enabling faster - than - light communication @xcite .",
    "probabilistic processes like stimulated emission , however , seem to evade this restriction . in einstein s treatment of stimulated emission @xcite",
    ", an excited atom interacting with a polarized photon is expected to produce sometimes a second photon with the same polarization , effectively delivering a perfect clone .",
    "true that some other times the atom will spontaneously emit a photon of random polarization , but still , when stimulated emission occurs , a perfect clone has been produced .",
    "if we had on our side a quantum version of maxwell demon , who separates the photons produced by stimulated emission from those produced by spontaneous emission , we would be able to generate any desired number of clones with a non - zero probability .",
    "unfortunately , our imaginary helper is not allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics : even with tiny probability , knowing whether or not stimulated emission took place would lead to a violation of the no - signalling principle ( incidentally , this observation should be taken as a reminder that einstein s treatment is just an approximation , whereas in the actual quantum dynamics stimulated and spontaneous emission happen in a coherent superposition ) .",
    "however , nothing forbids that other probabilistic processes , akin to spontaneous emission , could proliferate quantum information beyond any previously conceived limit .",
    "this possibility raises new fundamental questions : is it possible to engineer a process that duplicates a beam of @xmath0 equally prepared particles , producing a beam of @xmath3 almost perfect clones ?",
    "what is the ultimate rate at which quantum information proliferate without significant errors ?    here",
    "we answer both questions : although it is impossible to duplicate arbitrary quantum states , we devise a probabilistic mechanism that transforms an input beam of @xmath0 particles , equally prepared in a state @xmath4 generated by time evolution , into an output beam of magnified intensity , consisting of an overwhelming number @xmath5 of nearly perfect clones with a small error that vanishes rapidly whenever @xmath1 is small compared to @xmath2 .",
    "we name this new phenomenon super - replication and show that it is intrinsically probabilistic , by proving that deterministic processes can only produce a negligible number of nearly perfect replicas .",
    "for example , for 100 linearly polarized photons , super - replication allows one to produce @xmath6 replicas with fidelity @xmath7 , whereas the best deterministic process can only achieve fidelity @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we show that no physical process , deterministic or not , can proliferate quantum information at a rate larger than quadratic : any attempt to replicate quantum information beyond this limit is doomed to produce a joint output that has vanishing fidelity with the desired state .",
    "to explain the roots of this fundamental limitation , we establish a deep link between quantum cloning and the precision limits of quantum metrology @xcite , showing that the heisenberg limit sets the ultimate bound to the replication rate of probabilistic processes , while the standard quantum limit sets the corresponding bound in the deterministic regime .",
    "* the standard quantum limit for information replication . * optimal cloning is a fundamental primitive in quantum information @xcite .",
    "its goal is to transform @xmath0 input copies of a quantum state @xmath9 , randomly drawn from a set @xmath10 , into @xmath1 approximate copies that are as faithful as possible .",
    "the simplest figure of merit here is the fidelity @xmath11 between the @xmath1-particle state produced by the process and @xmath1 exact copies of the desired state , evaluated on the worst - case input state .",
    "inspired by information theory , we now consider a sequence of cloning processes that transform @xmath0 input copies into @xmath12 approximate copies and we say that the replication is reliable if the replication error vanishes in the limit of large @xmath0 . as an error measure",
    ", we use the infidelity @xmath13 . here",
    "the crucial question is : how large can @xmath1 grow as a function of @xmath0 in a reliable replication process ? to answer the question , we introduce the notion of replication rate , saying that a replication process has rate @xmath14 if the number of extra - copies scales like @xmath15 .",
    "we say that a rate is achievable if there exists a sequence of reliable replication processes with that rate .",
    "we will now see that the achievable replication rates are determined by the precision limits of quantum metrology .",
    "our first key result in this direction is a standard quantum limit ( sql ) for quantum replication : no deterministic process can reliably replicate a continuous set of quantum states at a rate larger than 1 .",
    "in other words , deterministic processes can only embezzle from nature a negligible number of extra - copies .",
    "the derivation of the sql for quantum replication is based on the sql for quantum metrology @xcite , applied to an arbitrary curve of states @xmath16 contained in the set of states that we are trying to clone .",
    "a sketch of proof is as follows : the sql states that the variance in the estimation of @xmath17 from @xmath0 copies is lower bounded by @xmath18 , for a constant @xmath19 that can be set to @xmath20 with a suitable choice of parametrization . now , suppose that there is a sequence of reliable deterministic processes with rate @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath0-th process will produce an @xmath1-particle output state @xmath21 , where @xmath22 for some constant @xmath23 , approaching the ideal target @xmath24 in the large @xmath0 limit . for simplicity ,",

    "now , if two states are close , so is the variance in the estimation of @xmath17 from these two states : for every fixed estimation strategy , we have the bound @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the variance in the estimation of @xmath17 from @xmath21 , @xmath30 is the variance in the estimation of @xmath17 from @xmath1 copies , and @xmath31 is a suitable constant . however , applying a deterministic transformation can not reduce the variance of the optimal estimation strategy , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we have the bound @xmath33 . choosing the best estimation strategy , we then obtain @xmath34 .",

    ", this means that the replication error is lower bounded as @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , for a reliable replication process the error can not vanish faster than a low degree polynomial .",

    "methods ) .",
    "a sketch of the argument is the following :",
    "any probabilistic process can be decomposed into the application of a filter  that transforms an input state @xmath45 into the output state @xmath46 for some suitable operator @xmath47followed by a deterministic process .",
    "now , if the set of states has strong symmetries , the optimal operator @xmath47 is forced to be equal to the identity , and the probabilistic process becomes equivalent to a deterministic one .",

    "* we now restrict our attention to the replication of states of the form @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a suitable hamiltonian .",
    "we call these states clock states , as they can be generated through a time evolution obeying the schrdinger equation . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on finite - dimensional quantum systems and we ignore the uninteresting case where @xmath51 is a multiple of the identity .",
    "the main result here is a heisenberg limit for the probabilistic replication of clock states . to get the result , we first establish a precision limit for probabilistic metrology , where one is allowed to take advantage of filters @xcite .",
    "our strategy is to apply the quantum cramr - rao bound @xcite to the states @xmath52 emerging from the filter . by explicit calculation",
    "( see supplementary note 2 ) , we bound the variance at a given point @xmath17 as @xmath53 where @xmath54|\\psi_t\\>}{2\\|m_{\\text{yes}}|\\psi_t\\>\\|^2 } $ ] .",
    "this innocent - looking application of the cramr - rao bound leads immediately to a surprise : optimizing over all filters @xmath47 , the r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( [ pcr ] ) can be made arbitrarily small , suggesting the possibility of unlimited precision ( cf .",
    "methods ) .",
    "note however , that in order to attain the equality in equation ( [ pcr ] ) , one should adapt the choice of filter to the value of @xmath17 , the unknown parameter that one is trying to estimate . in practice",
    ", this is not a realistic scenario . in the case of periodic evolution ,",
    "a more realistic setting is to have @xmath17 distributed according to a uniform prior @xmath55 over the period . in this case , the precision that can be achieved on average is still limited : denoting by @xmath56 the expected variance when the particles pass the filter , in supplementary note 3 we prove the bound @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the maximum ( minimum ) eigenvalue of the energy such that @xmath60 has non - zero overlap with the corresponding eigenspace .",
    "we note that @xmath61 is equal to the maximum of the variance of @xmath51 over all possible states @xmath62 contained in the subspace generated by the input states @xmath63 .",
    "such maximum is achieved by the  noon state \" @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) is an eigenstate of @xmath51 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath67 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "since these states are the best states for deterministic metrology @xcite , our result implies that the best strategy for probabilistic metrology with uniform prior consists just in using a filter that generates the noon state , and then applying the optimal deterministic estimation strategy .",
    "up to a small correction , the same result of equation ( [ protohl ] ) can be obtained when the evolution is non - periodic , by approximating the uniform distribution with a gaussian with large variance ( cf . supplementary note 4 ) .",
    "when @xmath0 identical copies of @xmath68 are available , equation ( [ protohl ] ) gives the heisenberg scaling @xmath69 equipped with this bound , we can now derive the heisenberg limit ( hl ) for quantum replication : no physical process can reliably replicate a set of clock states at a rate larger than @xmath70 . here is a sketch of proof : the filter transforms the product state @xmath71 into the entangled state @xmath72 .",
    "for this state , equation ( [ hl ] ) gives the bound @xmath73 with @xmath74 ( @xmath75 in the case of periodic evolution ) .",
    "now , suppose that there exists a sequence of probabilistic processes with replication rate @xmath76 , and suppose that the @xmath0-th process in the sequence produces @xmath77 approximate copies , with a trace distance from the ideal target vanishing asymptotically as @xmath78 ( this assumption is lifted in supplementary note 5 ) .",
    "then , the variance of the estimation from the output state @xmath21denoted by @xmath79will be close to the variance of the estimation from @xmath80 : for every @xmath17 , we will have @xmath81 , for some constant @xmath82 independent of @xmath17 . taking the average variance over the uniform prior @xmath55",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the averages of @xmath79 and @xmath86 , respectively . by definition ,",
    "the average variance @xmath85 is lower bounded by the sql and the bound is attained in the large @xmath1 limit by choosing a suitable measurement ( cf .",
    "methods ) .",
    "hence , by taylor expanding the terms in @xmath1 and keeping the leading order terms , we obtain @xmath87 , which implies @xmath88 . note that here @xmath89 disappeared from the equation : as there is no upper bound on @xmath89 , in principle the error can vanish faster than any polynomial !",
    "the hl leaves lots of room for replicating quantum information : for every rate @xmath90 one has the chance not only to duplicate the input copies , but also to produce an overwhelming number of replicas , with an error that vanish faster than any polynomial . in the next paragraph",
    ", we will exhibit explicit protocols that have all these features .",
    "our protocols are necessarily probabilistic , as a consequence of the sql , which constrains deterministic processes to produce a negligible number of extra - replicas .    * probabilistic super - replication . * here we show that clock states can be reliably replicated at any rate allowed by the hl .",
    "when the rate is larger than ( or equal to ) 1 , we call the process super - replication to emphasize the fact that it beats the sql .",
    "the key idea to achieve super - replication is to devise a filter that modulates the fourier amplitudes of the wavefunction in a way that enhances the replication performances to the maximum rate allowed by quantum mechanics . to move to the fourier picture",
    ", we express the input states as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 denotes the spectrum of the hamiltonian , @xmath93 is an eigenvector of @xmath51 with eigenvalue @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the probability that a measurement of the energy gives outcome @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath0 identical copies are given , the joint state can be expressed as @xmath97 is the total hamiltonian ( @xmath98 denoting the operator @xmath51 acting on the @xmath99-th system ) , @xmath100 is an eigenvector of @xmath101 for the eigenvalue @xmath96 , and @xmath102 is the probability that a measurement of the total energy gives outcome @xmath96 . choosing a filter @xmath47 that is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis",
    ", we can modulate the fourier amplitudes of the state ( [ state ] ) in any way we like .",
    "of course , since we aim at producing @xmath1 perfect copies , the natural choice is to replace @xmath0 with @xmath1 in the probability distribution @xmath102 .",
    "however , the spectrum of @xmath101 may be not be contained in the spectrum of @xmath103 and in general one needs to shift the energy values by a suitable amount @xmath104 ( see supplementary note 6 ) . with this choice",
    ", the state after the filter is projected to the entangled state @xmath105 .",
    "the state @xmath106 will now act as a quantum program , containing the instructions that will be used by a deterministic quantum device to generate @xmath1 approximate clones . for this purpose",
    ", we use a device that coherently transforms each eigenstate @xmath107 into the corresponding eigenstate @xmath108 , thus producing the state @xmath109 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the state @xmath110 has high fidelity with the desired state @xmath111 for every replication rate allowed by the heisenberg limit .",
    "precisely , for large enough @xmath0 one has the bound @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the number of energy levels @xmath96 such that @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( see supplementary note 7 for the proof ) .",
    "equation ( [ fidelity ] ) shows that the fidelity approaches 1 faster than any polynomial whenever @xmath1 is of order @xmath15 with @xmath116 , that is , whenever the replication rate satisfies the hl .",
    "a strong converse can be proven : every process replicating quantum states at a rate higher than @xmath117 must have vanishing fidelity in the limit of large @xmath0 , as showed in supplementary note 5 .",
    "thanks to our filter , we have been able to embezzle from nature a large number of replicas .",
    "the improvement is striking if one compares it with the performances of standard cloning processes .",
    "let us illustrate this fact for the replication of linear polarization states @xmath118 . in this case ,",
    "the best deterministic process is the phase - covariant cloner of ref .",
    "@xcite , and its fidelity is @xmath119 in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in agreement with our sql ,",
    "the fidelity vanishes whenever @xmath1 is of order @xmath120 , @xmath121 : as we proved in general , deterministic processes can only produce a number of extra replicas that is a negligible fraction of the number of input photons . in stark contrast , for @xmath122 input photons , our filter can produce @xmath123 approximate copies with fidelity @xmath124 , whereas the fidelity of the optimal deterministic cloner is only @xmath125 .",
    "in the example of linearly polarized photons our filter is provenly optimal , as it coincides with the optimal probabilistic cloner of ref .",
    "quite surprisingly , the possibility of super - replication was not recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the advantage of probabilistic processing was conjectured to be only of the order of one percent .",
    "the different features of replication processes at the hl and at the sql are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : demon ] in the case of linearly polarized photons .",
    "input copies is of order @xmath0 and the fidelity of the clones can not approach 1 faster than the inverse of a polynomial of degree 4 .",

    "the advantage of the filter is clear also in the non - asymptotic setting : a plot comparing the performances of replication with and without the filter in the case @xmath127 is presented in fig .",

    "the red ( green ) line refers to optimal cloning with ( without ) filter . ]",
    "what makes the improvement even more dramatic is that the quality of the replicas is measured by the global fidelity between the output state and the desired joint state of @xmath1 perfect copies , which is much smaller than the fidelity that each single copy has with the state @xmath68 .    * maximizing the probability of success . *",
    "the dazzling performances of super - replication come at a price : the probability that the input systems pass the filter has to decay with @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , in supplementary note 1 we already showed a strong converse of the sql : every deterministic process producing replicas at a rate higher than the sql must have vanishing fidelity .    for our filter ,",
    "the probability of super - replication at rate @xmath76 decreases exponentially fast as @xmath130\\le          e^{-   k n } $ ] for a suitable constant @xmath131 independent of @xmath14 ( see supplementary note 8) .",
    "one may ask whether there are ways to achieve super - replication with a larger success probability .",
    "it turns out that the answer is yes : in supplementary note 9 we show that a process producing @xmath132 replicas can have a success probability @xmath133 $ ] going to zero as @xmath134 for every desired @xmath135 .",
    "most importantly , for a super - replication process with rate @xmath136 , @xmath137 , we show how to increase the success probability to @xmath138 \\ge    e^{-n^\\delta } $ ] for every desired exponent @xmath139 .",

    "these results identify the optimal exponent for the decay of the success probability in a super - replication process , pinning down the tradeoff between the replication rate and success probability .",
    "interestingly , the choice between the advantage of a high replication rate and that of a unit success probability can be always delayed to the very last moment : indeed , it is easy to see that asymptotically the best deterministic replication process is just given by the coherent transformation @xmath144 that we used in our protocol . hence , an alternative way to achieve super - replication is to apply first the best deterministic process and later to modulate the fourier amplitudes of the wavefunction using a probabilistic filter .    *",
    "many - worlds fairness . *",
    "super - replication can be achieved not only for one - parameter families of clock states , but also for different manifolds of states , including the manifold of all maximally entangled states of two identical systems . however , super - replication is not a generic feature . as we already mentioned , if one tries to copy an arbitrary  as opposed to linear  polarization state , then no filter is going to help : the performances with filter are equal to the performances without filter . more generally , for generic quantum systems , no probabilistic filter can make an arbitrary quantum state more copiable .",
    "this property is quite compelling when considered from the angle of the many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite , because it states that no - branch of the wavefunction of the universe offers an advantage over the others in replicating the information contained in a completely unknown state . regarding different branches as  different worlds \"",
    ", we can formulate this as a fundamental principle , which we name many - worlds fairness : the maximum rate at which arbitrary information can proliferate is the same in all possible worlds .",
    "many world fairness rules out quantum mechanics on real hilbert spaces @xcite , an alternative physical theory where photons can have only linear polarizations .",
    "thanks to this observation , one can provide a new answer to the old questionwhy are physical systems described by complex  instead of real hilbert spaces ? \" .",
    "traditionally , the standard answer has been to invoke local tomography , the property that one can completely identify a mixed state from the statistics of local measurement on the components . however",
    ", one may consider this as an _ ad hoc _ requirement @xcite , and , in fact , there are even reasons to prefer real quantum mechanics to its complex version , as it was recently pointed out by wootters @xcite . balancing this fact , many world fairness offers a new reason ( other that the usual local tomography ) in favour of complex quantum mechanics .",
    "super - replication has been introduced here from a theoretical point of view .",
    "but is it possible to implement it experimentally ?",
    "luckily , very recently there have been experimental breakthroughs on the closely related topic of probabilistic amplification of coherent states of light @xcite .",
    "although the translation to our case is not immediate , we suggest that super - replication of linearly polarized photons could be achieved through a suitable sequence of amplitude damping channels , which for the polarization play the role of the photon subtraction for coherent states .",
    "an alternative approach is to first encode the state of the input copies into a coherent state via matter - light teleportation @xcite , amplify the coherent state in a probabilistic fashion , and then teleport back .",
    "this scheme provides a new application of the existing experimental schemes for coherent state amplification , making them the building block for the replication of quantum information at the heisenberg limit . finally , a third avenue towards implementing super - replication",
    "would be through stimulated emission , combined with a suitable monitoring of the emitting atoms .",
    "simulated emission has been discussed extensively in connection with deterministic cloning @xcite , but its potential for implementing probabilistic processes is still unexplored .    in relation to the existing literature ,",
    "it is interesting to comment on the relation between our results and previous works on probabilistic cloning and probabilistic estimation .",
    "the idea that in some situations even non - orthogonal states can be copied perfectly using a probabilistic device was first introduced by duan and guo @xcite , who showed that a set of pure quantum states can be copied perfectly if and only if they are linearly independent .",
    "this means that for a single photon one can perfectly copy two polarization states , while for @xmath0 photons one can copy at most @xmath145 states .",
    "subsequent works @xcite showed that probabilistic devices can improve the performances of approximate cloning for continuous sets of states , leading to nearly ideal performances in the case of coherent states with fixed amplitude .",
    "the nearly perfect cloning of coherent states may lead one to believe that in general there is no limit to the amount of clones that can be produced probabilistically .",
    "contrarily to this intuition , we have proven here that for finite quantum systems the heisenberg limit sets the ultimate bound @xmath146 to the number of clones that can be produced reliably .",
    "moreover , we have shown that for arbitrary one - parameter families of states , any replication rate allowed by the heisenberg limit can be achieved and we identified exactly the exponent at which the probability of success has to decay .",
    "finally , the relation between cloning and estimation has been extensively investigated in the literature @xcite in terms of single - copy fidelities . however , none of the approaches proposed so far was suitable to derive limits on the asymptotic replication rates , nor to connect the latter with quantum metrology .",
    "recently , it has been observed that the precision of quantum estimation can be improved using probabilistic strategies @xcite where , depending on the outcome of the filter , one can decide to abstain from estimating the parameter .",
    "the mechanism of abstention can sometimes boost the precision from the sql @xmath147 to the hl @xmath148 .",
    "the connection between these results and super - replication is made clear by our approach : the fact that a probabilistic filter can improve estimation until the hl implies that @xmath2 , rather than @xmath0 , is the upper bound for the replication rate of the states @xmath149 .",
    "however , there is an important catch : the filter that achieves replication at the hl is not the same filter that achieves estimation at the hl .",
