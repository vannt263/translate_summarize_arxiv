    "conventional charge transport experiments directly measure the electrical conductance or current flow through a sample . instead of measuring the rate at which electrons flow through a sample , it is sometimes desirable to have direct access to the charge degree of freedom using sensitive electrometers .",
    "for example , charge sensing can be used for real - time counting of electrons @xcite , imaging of current flow through nanostructures such as quantum point contacts @xcite , imaging electron - hole puddles in graphene @xcite , and single electron capacitance spectroscopy of quantum hall states @xcite .",
    "charge detection is also a necessary ingredient for quantum computation using electrons trapped in gate defined quantum dots @xcite . for spin qubits , a process",
    "called spin - to - charge conversion is used for readout @xcite .",
    "charge sensing is also needed to accurately measure the charge stability diagram of double quantum dots ( dqd ) and determine the absolute electronic occupancy .",
    "sensing in quantum dots has traditionally been performed using quantum point contacts ( qpc ) or single electron transistors ( set ) @xcite",
    ".    one method to improve the charge sensing bandwidth involves embedding the qpc or set in a resonant tank circuit and performing rf - reflectometry @xcite .",
    "reflectometry experiments have so far utilized standard cryogenic low - noise amplifiers @xcite .",
    "the increased data acquisition rate of rf - based measurements reduces the susceptibility to @xmath1 noise and enables single - shot spin readout @xcite .",
    "while rf - reflectometry has allowed charge detection times as short as 100 ns with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath2 @xcite , recent progress in superconducting quantum circuits opens a path forward for further improvements .",
    "the application of quantum limited josephson parametric amplifiers ( jpas ) @xcite has accelerated progress in the field of superconducting qubits .",
    "these amplifiers are nearly quantum limited , meaning they add the minimum amount of noise dictated by the uncertainty relation @xcite , and have enabled high fidelity single shot readout of qubit states @xcite as well as squeezed light experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate jpa - assisted readout of a dqd that is coupled to a high frequency superconducting cavity .",
    "we achieve a factor of 2000 improvement in the snr by operating the jpa in a nonlinear regime , in which the average readout signal experiences a larger amplification than the incoming noise . with an integration time of just 400 ns",
    ", we achieve a snr of 76 .",
    "the large snr allows us to efficiently map out the dqd charge stability diagram in just 20 ms using a dual gate - voltage rastering scheme .",
    "such dramatic improvements enable real - time  video - mode \" tuning of a dqd device .",
    "the faster device optimization that jpa assisted readout allows will become crucial as quantum dot architectures with more control parameters are developed @xcite .",
    "our device architecture is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "the experiment consists of three main components : a dqd formed in an inas nanowire , a nb superconducting cavity to which the dqd is coupled , and a jpa that is used to amplify the output field of the cavity . in the following sections we describe each of these components in detail .",
    "the dqd is fabricated using a bottom - gated architecture as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) @xcite .",
    "we place a single inas nanowire of nominally 50 nm diameter @xcite across five depletion gates @xcite .",
    "we label the gates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "a double - well potential is formed by selectively depleting the nanowire using the bottom gates @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath7 control the left and right barriers , @xmath4 and @xmath6 control @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the electrochemical potential of each dot , and @xmath5 controls the interdot tunneling rate @xcite .",
    "after passivating the nanowire using an ammonium polysulfide etch @xcite we deposit ti / au contacts to form the source and drain electrodes .",
    "the source is connected to a voltage anti - node of a half - wavelength superconducting resonator and the drain is connected to the resonator ground plane @xcite .",
    "the cavity is implemented as a coplanar half - wavelength superconducting resonator with a resonance frequency @xmath10 mhz , see fig .",
    "a 50 nm thick nb film is sputter deposited on a high resistivity silicon substrate with a 250 nm thick layer of thermally grown @xmath11 .",
    "the input and output capacitors result in input and output coupling rates @xmath12 mhz .",
    "internal radiation losses result in a total cavity decay rate @xmath13 mhz equivalent to a loaded quality factor @xmath14 .",
    "the source contact of the nanowire is connected to a voltage anti - node of the resonator , resulting in a large electric dipole coupling between the dqd and the resonator @xcite .",
    "we probe the hybrid system by applying a tone @xmath15 of power @xmath16 dbm to the input port of the cavity .",
    "charge dynamics in the dqd change the effective admittance of the microwave cavity leading to a measurable dispersive shift of the resonance frequency @xcite .       is used to probe a cavity - coupled dqd .",
    "the output field of the cavity is amplified using a jpa and then demodulated into the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quadratures .",
    "the amplification band of the jpa is flux - tuned using a small coil that creates a magnetic field @xmath19 .",
    "( b ) illustration of the dqd - cavity system .",
    "a single nanowire is placed on top of 5 depletion gates .",
    "negative voltages on the gates establish a double - well potential , forming the dqd .",

    "( d ) phase @xmath20 of the signal reflected off of the jpa as a function of the total incident power @xmath21 .",
    "we operate in phase - sensitive mode with @xmath22 and use the strong phase dependence to translate small differences in the cavity output field to large phase shifts of the microwaves reflected off of the jpa . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) the jpa is implemented as a quarter - wavelength resonator etched from a 200 nm nb layer on top of a sapphire substrate @xcite .",
    "the input port has a coupling rate @xmath23 and is formed using an interdigitated capacitor geometry .",
    "the resonator is shunted by a series array of @xmath24 superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) .",
    "the squids act as a non - linear inductor and allow for amplification of the signal field via the pump field resulting in a lorentzian gain profile with nearly constant gain - bandwidth product : @xmath25 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 is the jpa power gain ( which can be tuned using the applied pump power @xmath27 ) , while @xmath28 is the 3 db bandwidth .",
    "the dynamic range of the amplifier is set by the strength of the pump field required for a given gain and can be improved by increasing the number of squids @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath29 with each squid having maximal josephson energy @xmath30 thz and design our coupling capacitance to be @xmath31 ff for a target @xmath32 mhz .",
    "a detailed treatment of the design considerations of this class of amplifiers is given in ref .",
    "we use the amplifier in phase - sensitive mode @xcite and set @xmath33 mhz , which is the resonance frequency of our cavity .",
    "the jpa is tuned such that the reflected phase @xmath20 is highly sensitive to the total incident power @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath21 is a combination of the pump power @xmath27 and the power of the cavity output field , @xmath34 .",
    "figure 1(d ) shows @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "we set @xmath35 dbm , which maximizes @xmath36 . adding the cavity output field to the pump",
    "modifies the total power incident on the jpa .",
    "this will result in large differences of the phase of the reflected pump signal .",
    "thus in this measurement mode the small cavity output field modulates the phase of the much stronger reflected pump tone , leading to amplification .",
    "we further improve the snr of our readout chain by driving the jpa beyond the regime where it amplifies linearly .",
    "we choose the power and the phase of the cavity drive field such that the dispersive shift changes the total power at the jpa from @xmath37 dbm to @xmath38 dbm @xcite .",
    "as such , the dispersive shift will change @xmath21 from above the region of maximum @xmath36 to below .",
    "this means that while the dispersive shift produces a large change in @xmath20 , any noise fluctuations will invariably occur in regions with smaller @xmath39 and be amplified less @xcite .",
    "the bias point of the jpa is thus chosen such that its amplification characteristics fall between those of a linear amplifier and a bifurcation amplifier @xcite .",
    "the signal exiting the jpa is further amplified using a high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifier at the 3 k stage of the dilution refrigerator and room temperature amplifiers @xcite .",
    "we can turn off the jpa by simply removing the pump tone . here",
    "the signal from the cavity reflects off of the jpa with unity gain . in both cases",
    "we demodulate the signal using a heterodyne detection setup .",
    "we first downconvert the signal to 12.5 mhz by mixing it with a local oscillator tone @xmath40 mhz .",
    "it is then digitized using a fpga - based digital homodyne stage to recover the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quadrature amplitudes @xcite .",
    "we now highlight the dramatic enhancement in the data acquisition rate that is enabled by the jpa .",
    "we first demonstrate rapid measurements of a large - scale dqd charge stability diagram using a jpa .",
    "the snr values obtained with and without the jpa are then compared , indicating a factor of 2000 improvement with the jpa .",
    "lastly , we demonstrate video - mode acquisition of charge stability diagrams using a rastered sweep of two gate voltages , resulting in data display that is similar to a cathode ray tube and of a comparable refresh rate .      a large scale charge stability diagram is shown in fig .  2 , where we plot the normalized @xmath18 quadrature amplitude as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "these data are acquired by measuring the total reflected field from the jpa with the jpa pump tone on . with the dqd in coulomb blockade , the resonator is insensitive to the dqd , resulting in large regions in the stability diagram with uniform amplitude and phase . following previous work ,",
    "we normalize the amplitude @xmath41 , such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 in these charge stability islands @xcite . with this normalization",

    "when an electron can tunnel between the two dots ( interdot charge transition ) or on and off one of the dots ( single dot charge transition ) , the transmitted field through the resonator will be affected , which we detect as a non - zero @xmath18 quadrature amplitude . as a result the data in fig .  2 trace out the charge stability diagram of the dqd @xcite .",
    "the nearly horizontal lines are associated with the addition or removal of an electron from the left dot .",
    "the lines with positive slope correspond to interdot charge transitions where the total electron number is fixed , but an electron moves from one dot to the other . due to the large distance between the cavity center pin and the right tunnel barrier , right dot charge transitions are not visible .",
    "we can infer their location based on the positions of the interdot charging lines .",
    "we use the charging lines to label the electron states as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the number of electrons on the left ( right ) dot . for this data",
    "set , the device is configured in the many - electron regime , where @xmath47 @xmath49 @xmath48 @xmath49 20 .",
    "we note that the data shown in fig .",

    "]    to quantify the improvement in the snr due to the jpa we investigate the sensing signal at an interdot charge transition .",
    "interdot charge transitions are most relevant in quantum control experiments since interdot tunneling is spin selective and can be used to distinguish spin singlet and triplet states @xcite .",
    "figures 3(a  b ) show charge stability diagrams obtained near the @xmath50 interdot charge transition .",
    "for each point of the colormap the @xmath18 quadrature is averaged for @xmath53 . for a direct comparison , the data in fig .",

    "3(d ) , the snr is much worse when only the hemt is used . with @xmath55 the snr = 1.4 , meaning the charge transition is barely resolvable .",
    "the signal from the interdot charge transition can be recovered by increasing @xmath52 .",
    "increasing @xmath52 beyond @xmath61s is accomplished by averaging multiple time - traces @xcite .",
    "the result for @xmath62 ms is shown in the upper trace of fig .",

    "3(e ) with the jpa on and off . in both cases",
    "the curves are very well fit with @xmath63 here @xmath64 is a fitting parameter that corresponds to the minimum integration time required to achieve a snr = 1 . with the jpa on , a best fit is obtained with @xmath65 ns , while with the jpa off @xmath66s , corresponding to a factor of 2000 improvement in the snr .",
    "the linear dependence of the snr on @xmath52 is expected and can be understood from the fact that @xmath52 sets the effective low - pass filter of the detection chain . decreasing @xmath52 increases the bandwidth and therefore the noise power , while the signal power will remain constant @xcite .",
    "we now estimate the minimum time required for single charge detection , in terms of both sensitivity and ultimate bandwidth . from the fitting",
    "described above the minimum integration time necessary for a snr = 1 is @xmath67 ns . since charge sensitivity",
    "is related to minimum integration time through : @xmath68 , our detector has an equivalent charge sensitivity of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the bandwidth of our detection chain is limited by the cavity linewidth and the jpa bandwidth .",
    "the former is set by @xmath70 mhz and can be extended by increasing the output coupling capacitance .",
    "the latter is constrained by the jpa gain - bandwidth product . in our case",
    "we operated the jpa with a gain @xmath71 and a bandwidth of 3.8 mhz @xcite .",
    "this limit can be circumvented by more advanced amplifier designs @xcite .",
    "the above means that we are bandwidth limited by the cavity to detection times longer than @xmath72 ns .",
    "quadrature amplitude as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the scan was acquired by rastering the gate voltages over a 20 ms period .",
    "the rastering scheme is illustrated in the lower inset .",
    "starting in the lower left hand corner of the stability diagram , @xmath6 is repeatedly ramped with a 40 @xmath73s period . at the same time",
    "@xmath4 is ramped up with a @xmath74 ms period .",
    "the rastering configuration is similar to cathode - ray - tube monitors .",
    "the high snr then allows for real - time tuning of the dqd .",
    "this is accomplished using an intuitive user interface pictured in the upper inset . ]    with the jpa on , the dramatic increase in the snr allows for very fast acquisition of charge stability diagrams .",
    "for example with @xmath54 ns a typical 100 @xmath75 100 point color map can be acquired in just 4 ms . to take advantage of this ,",
    "we develop a dual gate - voltage rastering scheme .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower inset of fig .",
    "starting in the lower left corner of the charge stability diagram , we repeatedly ramp @xmath6 with a @xmath76 period . at the same time we also ramp @xmath4 with a @xmath74 ms period . the resulting data set rasters over a two - dimensional voltage subspace within a 20 ms period .",
    "during this time we record a single time trace of the measured quadrature with @xmath54 ns and reorder it to form a 2d image that can be displayed .",
    "a sample frame acquired using this approach is shown in fig .",
    "as coupled quantum dot systems continue to scale in complexity , it will become increasingly important to rapidly obtain charge stability diagrams and optimize the relevant tunneling rates .",
    "traditionally , gate voltages have been optimized through a slow iterative process that involves changing gate voltages and observing the resulting charge stability diagram .",
    "the process is time consuming , in part due to the time necessary to acquire a new scan of the charge transition being tuned ( often on the order of minutes ) .",
    "we have built a simple user interface to control the experiment ( see upper inset of fig .",
    "4 ) and use our rastering scheme to continuously update the charge transition in question .",
    "a user can then simply click on a set of buttons to adjust electrostatic gate voltages , while the results of the parameter tuning are displayed in real - time .",
    "this gives immediate feedback and allows one to arrive at the optimal gate voltages with ease .",
    "a demonstration of this form of device tuning is captured in a video in the supplementary materials @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have used a jpa for fast measurements of a cavity - coupled semiconductor dqd .",
    "the addition of the jpa results in a factor of 2000 improvement in the snr compared to traditional hemt amplifier approaches . as a result ,",
    "the minimum time to detect a single charge is limited by the linewidth of the cavity .",
    "we also develop a dual gate - voltage rastering scheme that allows us to measure a graph of a charge transition in 20 ms .",
    "this enables real - time device tuning , which has the potential to greatly increase the rate at which complex quantum dot devices are optimized . together with frequency",
    "multiplexing @xcite , jpa assisted readout may allow simultaneous fast readout of several dqds .",
