    "temperature , @xmath3 , ranges from ambient conditions to deep into the supercooled regime , and pressure , @xmath2 , ranges from atmospheric conditions through the range of stability for ordinary hexagonal ice .",
    "experimentally , this region corresponds to @xmath12 and @xmath13.@xcite the locations of specific features relative to experiment vary from one molecular model to another.@xcite this variability reflects a delicate competition between entropy and energy that is intrinsic to any reasonable model of water or water - like system .    one manifestation of this competition is the existence of the temperature of maximum density .",
    "we use @xmath5 to denote the value of this temperature at ambient ( i.e. , low pressure ) conditions . for experimental water ,",
    "the energy - entropy balance manifested in the density maximum is shifted to lower temperatures as elevated pressures favor denser packing .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] also shows a reduced glass transition temperature , @xmath20 .",
    "this temperature is defined as that where the reversible structural relaxation time of liquid water equals 100s .",
    "glass phases of water , where aging occurs on time scales of 100s or longer , are not generally accessible by straightforward supercooling because bulk liquid water spontaneously freezes into crystal ice at temperatures below @xmath7 .",
    "freezing in this regime occurs in mili - second or shorter time scales.@xcite an amorphous solid can be reached with a cooling trajectory that is initially fast enough to arrest crystallization , and finally cold enough to produce very slow aging .",
    "alternatively , one may cool while perturbing water with surfaces that inhibit crystallization .",
    "an actual glass transition temperature of water is therefore not a material property because its value depends upon the protocol by which the material is driven out of equilibrium .",

    "these steps are arrested when forming glass.@xcite configurations appearing at the initial stages of this coarsening are often observed in computer simulations of water .",
    "these configurations are transient states that are almost as often confused with the presence of two distinct supercooled liquid phases , and claims that some water - like models do not exhibit this behavior@xcite are based upon studies that have not examined this part of the phase diagram .",
    "two distinct reversible liquids in coexistence would imply the existence of a low temperature critical point of the sort suggested by stanley and his co - workers.@xcite not surprisingly , all reports of a low - temperature critical point in water or water - like systems locate a point on or near @xmath22 .",

    "supercooled water , being a metastable state , behaves reversibly for only finite observation times .",
    "the specific length of that time depends on the separation of timescales between local equilibration of liquid configurations and global crystallization .",

    "<S> water famously expands upon freezing , foreshadowed by a negative coefficient of expansion of the liquid at temperatures close to its freezing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors , and many others , reflect the energetic preference for local tetrahedral arrangements of water molecules and entropic effects that oppose it . here </S>",
    "<S> , we provide theoretical analysis of mesoscopic implications of this competition , both equilibrium and non - equilibrium , including mediation by interfaces . with general scaling arguments bolstered by simulation results , and with reduced units that elucidate corresponding states , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a phase diagram for bulk and confined water and water - like materials . for water itself , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding states cover the temperature range of 150k to 300k and the pressure range of 1bar to 2kbar . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , there are two reversible condensed phases  ice and liquid . out of equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , there is irreversible polyamorphism , i.e. , more than one glass phase , reflecting dynamical arrest of coarsening ice . </S>",
    "<S> temperature - time plots are derived to characterize time scales of the different phases and explain contrasting dynamical behaviors of different water - like systems . </S>"
