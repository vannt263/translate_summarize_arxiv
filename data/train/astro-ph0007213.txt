    "one of the key differences between the competing theories is an approximately gaussian distribution of density fluctuations produced in most inflationary theories versus the generically non - gaussian inhomogeneities in scenarios based on topological defects . a precise statistical analysis of the cmb fluctuations is needed to distinguish non - gaussian signatures of cosmic defects @xcite and small deviations from gaussianity in inflationary universe due to generic effects such as a non - linear evolution @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , and higher - order couplings during recombination @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum , which is the statistic easiest both to predict theoretically and to extract from data , is by definition insensitive to non - gaussian correlations . for this reason , and especially in view of forthcoming observations , detection of non - gaussian features in the cmb is an important task .    since all theories give only statistical predictions of the cmb , one s conclusions from a single observation of the microwave sky are by necessity probabilistic .",
    "many criteria of gaussianity have been proposed in the literature and applied to the available data , mostly yielding results consistent with the gaussian hypothesis @xcite .",
    "although some claims of finding a non - gaussian signal in cobe have been advanced recently @xcite , not all of them are equally persuasive and some have been ascribed to data contamination and noise in refs .  @xcite .",
    "apart from these problems , the usefulness of any cmb statistic is fundamentally limited by cosmic variance .",
    "therefore we would like to look for statistical descriptors of non - gaussian signal that have a naturally low variance",
    ".    cosmic variance manifests itself differently in real space and in the fourier space where the cmb temperature fluctuations are usually decomposed into modes @xmath0 using the spherical harmonic expansion @xmath1 the power spectrum estimator @xmath2 is increasingly more precise at smaller angular scales ( higher @xmath3 ) . in other words , the cosmic variance in the fourier space",
    "is shifted away from small scales toward large scales .",
    "one would therefore expect any statistics of fourier modes at very small scales to be relatively free of cosmic variance . on the other hand ,",
    "real space data is correlated and estimators based on correlations of @xmath4 are equally affected by cosmic variance throughout all angular scales .",
    "( the recently introduced wavelet - based statistics @xcite can be regarded as occupying the middle ground between the real and the fourier space descriptors .",
    "see also @xcite for an example of a low - variance real - space statistic which is however strongly power - spectrum dependent . )",
    "this motivates us to consider small - scale fourier modes in hopes of obtaining a sensitive statistic .",
    "previous research @xcite suggests that individual fourier modes are likely to be nearly gaussian distributed because of the central limit theorem .",
    "therefore we intend to investigate inter - scale correlations in fourier space for the role of non - gaussian indicators .",
    "a non - gaussian signal may manifest itself as a correlation between fourier modes @xmath0 of different scales @xmath3 ; this extra correlation must be of third order or higher because homogeneity requires @xmath5 .",
    "the third - order correlator of the fourier modes , called the `` bispectrum '' , has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite and recently applied to the cobe data @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the bispectrum carries signatures from cosmic defects , as well as from non - linearities of evolution in inflationary models .",
    "defects generically produce non - gaussian features also in higher - order correlations , as we shall show .",
    "we would like to reformulate the problem of finding the cross - correlation between some chosen scales @xmath3 and @xmath6 as a gaussianity test on a suitable distribution .",
    "consider for simplicity a random field in flat ( two - dimensional ) space , decomposed into fourier modes @xmath7 .",
    "we may regard the set of mode values @xmath8 at the scales @xmath9 , @xmath10 as a sample of a two - variable distribution @xmath11 and proceed to test that distribution for gaussianity .",
    "a general way of testing a distribution for gaussianity is by using cumulants ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in our case",
    "we need to employ suitable multi - variable cumulants , such as a third - order cumulant @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "such cumulants describe non - gaussian correlations between perturbations at different scales .",
    "since the variance of a cumulant estimator is decreased when the number of points in the sample grows , we expect the statistic to be increasingly more sensitive on smaller scales ( larger @xmath3 )",
    ". we shall demonstrate for a gaussian field that fourier space cumulant estimators of any order @xmath14 , which we denote @xmath15 , at small scales ( large @xmath16 ) are statistically approximately independent and _ themselves _ approximately gaussian distributed .",
    "we also find the variances of these cumulant estimators of any order .",
    "this significantly simplifies the likelihood analysis , since the variances are theoretically known and the estimators can be normalized to have unit variances .    in other words ,",
    "if the underlying cmb map were gaussian , all quantities @xmath17 for all scales @xmath16 form ( after normalization ) a sample of independent realizations of a normal distribution .",
    "one could test this hypothesis by choosing an appropriate range of accessible scales @xmath16 , combining all estimators @xmath18 at these scales into one sample and computing the first few cumulants @xmath19 ( we take @xmath20 ) of that sample . if the gaussian hypothesis holds for the original distribution , the quantities @xmath19 are in turn gaussian distributed with known means and variances .",
    "we now propose this as a gaussianity test for the original map .",
    "likelihood analysis of the descriptors @xmath19 is at least as strong as a simultaneous fit of all inter - scale cumulants and is potentially more discriminating .    in this method",
    ", one is free to choose a subset of cumulants @xmath18 and a subset of scales @xmath16 at which to evaluate them . since the statistical variance of the cumulant estimators",
    "is decreased at smaller scales ( larger @xmath16 ) but grows as @xmath21 with the order @xmath14 of the cumulants , the most promising results should come from the lowest cumulants , such as the bispectrum ( @xmath22 ) , and at smallest available scales . in this initial investigation",
    "we use only the bispectrum to build the estimators @xmath23 .    to evaluate the efficiency of the method",
    ", we use several simulated non - gaussian fields inspired by defect - based structure formation models .",
    "one of the simulated models consists a superposition of fixed temperature profiles centered on a random set of poisson distributed points .",
    "the advantage of this model is that for any shape of the profile and for any distribution of the profile intensity and size , one can analytically obtain the full generating functional of the resulting random field , which allows ( in principle ) to evaluate any statistic . in particular , it is straightforward to estimate the expected inter - scale correlations of fourier modes of this field .",
    "another model we used is a simulated cmb map from cosmic strings @xcite , superimposed on gaussian background and pixel noise .",
    "our goal in all simulations was to find the levels of gaussian backgrounds at which the non - gaussian signal is still detectable with our statistic , given a certain level of noise .",

    "[ sec : ngm ] we describe a model non - gaussian field made up of a random superposition of shapes , analytically determine the expected non - vanishing cumulants , and investigate the sensitivity of our criterion for that model in presence of gaussian backgrounds .",

    "[ sec : num ] we present numerical results obtained with several simulated non - gaussian maps using the lowest - order statistic based on the bispectrum .",
    "the method is tested on maps of point sources , random rectangles , and cosmic strings , mixed with gaussian background and noise .",
    "we give brief conclusions about the viability of the proposed method .",
    "for simplicity , in this section we consider random fields on a plane ; the results can be straightforwardly generalized to random fields on a sphere , such as the cmb temperature perturbation @xmath24 . from the fourier space viewpoint ,",
    "a random field @xmath25 is a collection of random variables ( modes ) @xmath7 , @xmath26 homogeneity of the random field ( translation invariance in real space ) constrains the joint distribution of @xmath27 , namely the moments must satisfy @xmath28 and isotropy means that moments are invariant under rotations @xmath29 in the fourier space , @xmath30 ( in the spherical case , there is only one condition of invariance under rotations of the sphere . )",

    "it is easy to see that the general cumulants @xmath38 satisfy homogeneity and isotropy conditions similar to eqs .",

    "this , for instance , constrains the cumulants @xmath47 to identically vanish unless @xmath48 .",
    "now we turn to statistics of @xmath7 that are relevant for the analysis of data coming from one observation . since a measurement of one realization of the random field gives only one set of values @xmath49 , we are limited in the kinds of information about the joint distribution of @xmath27 that we can extracted without _ a priori _ knowledge .",
    "for instance , we can not efficiently test eqs .",
    "( [ eq : homgen])-([eq : isogen ] ) for any particular choice of @xmath50 because in each case we would have only one value : @xmath51 .",
    "an inhomogeneous random field that has a `` wrong '' distribution of just one mode @xmath7 can not be distinguished from a homogeneous and isotropic field on the basis of one sample .",
    "( of course , one would not expect such an artificial random field to have physical relevance . )",
    "similarly , we can not test the hypothesis that any two particular modes @xmath52 and @xmath53 come from a jointly gaussian distribution if only one realization of these modes is available .",
    "clearly one can efficiently test a distribution for gaussianity only if one has a large enough number of samples of that distribution .",
    "therefore , to obtain any result at all concerning the gaussianity of @xmath7 , we must assume that several of the modes @xmath7 come from the same distribution .",
    "from the natural assumption of isotropy it follows that the modes @xmath7 within a ring of fixed scale @xmath54 are identically distributed , and thus the ring @xmath55 provides a sample that allows us to test their distribution for gaussianity .",
    "this is the assumption behind the bispectrum test . strictly speaking , a negative result of such a test would indicate either a non - gaussian or an anisotropic distribution . however , most theories predict isotropy of cmb , and , assuming that all foregrounds are adequately dealt with , we are much less interested in detecting anisotropy or inhomogeneity than we are in finding non - gaussian signals .",
    "we are therefore motivated to assume homogeneity and isotropy and to regard the modes @xmath7 at a fixed scale @xmath9 as independent samples of the same joint distribution of modes .",
    "this assumption also allows us to investigate correlations between different scales , which is the main interest of the present article .",

    "the values @xmath56 along the two rings may be regarded as independent realizations of the joint two - variable distribution .",

    "one of the advantages of employing @xmath147 for testing gaussianity is that their theoretical distributions are known , so that one does not need to implement monte carlo simulations for the likelihood analysis , i.e.  to compute the `` equivalent gaussian realizations '' from the map being tested . in the likelihood analyses below we shall simply shade the one - sigma area @xmath159 in all relevant plots .",
    "one important challenge for all cmb data analysis is to deal with the presence of point sources .",
    "this usually unwanted component obscures the cosmological non - gaussian signal in most cmb non - gaussian tests . for this reason it is important to see how this component contributes to our estimators",

    "the map of point sources is superimposed onto the same gaussian background as in the previous subsection , with a fraction of the point sources @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the rms amplitude of the point signal .",

    "[ fig - pow ] . by comparing this line to the solid line ( the power spectrum of the gaussian background )",

    "once @xmath167 , the power spectrum of the point signal starts to dominate at @xmath173 , at which stage it fails the test .",
    "thus , we conclude that our estimators @xmath147 are sensitive to point sources .",
    "for this method to succeed in real cmb data , therefore , it will be necessary to first remove the point sources using any of the available methods ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and then compute the estimators @xmath148 . in the following analyses",
    ", we shall ignore the point sources by assuming that they have been removed beforehand .      to test the sensitivity of our method to certain types of non - gaussianity ,",
    "we first try a simple model using filled rectangles . in a @xmath174 field with a resolution of @xmath175 pixels ,",
    "we generate five filled rectangles , each having a size of @xmath176 grid spacings .",
    "these rectangles are shown in fig .",

    "we find that one can use @xmath179 to reject the hypothesis of gaussianity at more than a 95% confidence level when @xmath180 .",
    "this means that non - gaussian features of the rectangles show up once their rms amplitude is larger than a few percent of the total amplitude .",
    "referring to the power spectrum of the rectangles in fig .",
    "[ fig - pow ] ( the dashed line ) , we see that once @xmath181 , the power of the rectangles never comes to dominate when compared with the power of the gaussian background ( the solid line ) .",
    "this explains why non - gaussian features of the rectangles are not visible in @xmath147 when @xmath181 .",
    "we also test the sensitivity of our method to the rectangles in the presence of noise . in this case",
    "we mix three components : the rectangles , the gaussian background , and the white noise .",
    "the last two components are exactly the same as the two we used in section  [ the - gaussian - background - and - instrument - noise ] .",
    "the noise fraction is fixed as @xmath182 , so the rectangles have a fraction @xmath183 the @xmath147 are computed as a function of @xmath177 , and the results are presented in fig .",

    "for example , one can use @xmath179 to reject the hypothesis of gaussianity at more then 95% confidence level only when @xmath184 . referring to the power spectra of the rectangles , the gaussian background , and the noise in fig .",
    "[ fig - pow ] , one finds that when @xmath185 with @xmath182 , the power of the rectangles is dominated by the power of the gaussian components ( the gaussian background and the noise ) ; but when @xmath184 , the power in rectangles starts to dominate at @xmath186 .",
    "this verifies again that for @xmath147 to succeed in detecting a non - gaussian signal , the power of the the non - gaussian component needs to dominate within at least a certain range of the accessible @xmath3 .",
    "thus we see that noise may reduce the sensitivity of our method for detecting non - gaussian signals , depending on whether the noise dominates the non - gaussian signal on scales where it originally dominated .      finally , we test our method against the string - induced cmb map .",
    "we use a toy model of ref .",
    "@xcite to simulate the string - induced integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect .",
    "this model incorporates most main features of cosmic strings , such as the scaling and self - avoiding properties , as well as their wiggliness .",
    "one realization of the resulting cmb is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : str ] .",
    "the dynamic range is @xmath187 in conformal time starting from last scattering , and the angular size is @xmath188 with a resolution of @xmath175 . a gaussian background is simulated as before .",
    "these two maps are then linearly summed , with a string fraction @xmath189 defined as above .",
    "the estimators @xmath147 are calculated as functions of @xmath189 , and the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - wi - str ] .    from the solid line in the figure ( @xmath190 )",

    "the power spectrum of the gaussian background is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig - pow ] , while that of the string - induced isw effect is shown with the thick dashed line in the same plot .",
    "again , if we compare these two lines , we find that when @xmath192 , the string - induced perturbations are dominated by the gaussian background on all scales ; when @xmath191 , the string - induced perturbations start to dominate at @xmath193 .",
    "this result is consistent with our previous argument about the sensitivity of the estimators @xmath147 .    in the presence of",
    "instrumental noise , this sensitivity will be reduced if the noise dominates the string - induced perturbations on scales where they originally dominated .",
    "in other words , the presence of the noise will contribute extra power to the gaussian component of the underlying map , so as to raise the threshold in power beyond which the non - gaussian signal may dominate .",
    "this argument is again verified in fig .",
    "[ fig - wi - str - noi ] , where we mix three components : the string - induced isw effect , the gaussian background , and the white noise whose strength is @xmath194 of the total rms amplitude .",
    "this gives @xmath195 as one can see , the hypothesis of gaussianity is rejected at more than a 95% confidence level when @xmath196 , using @xmath197 .",
    "this threshold @xmath198 can be again verified by comparing the thick dashed , solid , and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - pow ] .    by comparing results for strings and rectangles ( see section  [ test - on - filled - rectangles ] ) , we find that they have similar thresholds for rejecting the hypothesis of gaussianity .",
    "this is because strings and rectangles have almost identical power spectra and they dominate the gaussian component above similar thresholds and at similar scales .    by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig - wi - str ] and [ fig - wi - str - noi ] , with figs .",
    "[ fig - wi - pnt ] , [ fig - wi - rect ] and [ fig - wi - rect - noi ] , we find that only string - induced perturbations result in a significantly negative value of the estimator @xmath190 , while all other non - gaussian components we tried produce only positive @xmath147 outside the 95% confidence region ( the two - sigma region ) .",
    "this provides a potential discriminator in distinguishing string - induced features from other non - gaussian signals .",
    "in this paper , we studied the properties of normalized inter - scale cumulants of fourier modes for homogeneous random fields and proposed a new set of statistics to test a small - scale cmb map for gaussianity .",
    "we showed that higher - order cumulant estimators of fourier components of gaussian fields are themselves nearly gaussian distributed variables with zero expectation value and known variances .",
    "therefore , a test of gaussianity of these cumulant estimators computed from a given map constitutes a test of gaussianity of the map .",
    "this method is quite general and can be employed on cumulants of any order .",
    "however , since the usefulness of higher - order cumulants quickly drops with the order , the bispectrum components and the 4-th order correlators are the most promising candidates .    as an application ,",
    "the statistical estimators that we denoted by @xmath147 were constructed from all available bispectrum components .",
    "we prepared simulated maps made up of random point sources , random rectangles , and simulated cosmic string networks , superimposed on gaussian background and pixel noise . by developing an analytic model of fields containing random superimposed shapes",
    ", we showed that inter - scale cumulants of all orders are generically present in such fields , and that noise and gaussian background limits the sensitivity of the cumulant estimators on scales where its power spectrum is significant compared to the power spectrum of the non - gaussian component .",
    "we numerically verified that the discriminators @xmath147 are sensitive to non - gaussian signal of simulated maps , as well as to point sources . to apply these statistics to detect certain types of non - gaussian signals such as those resulting from defects",
    ", one needs therefore to remove point sources on scales where they dominate the non - gaussian components one would like to detect .",
    "the instrumental noise was also shown to be capable of reducing the sensitivity of our new method , due to its extra contribution to the gaussian component on small scales .",
    "nevertheless , as we theoretically showed and numerically verified , our new statistics are capable of detecting non - gaussian component as long as its power spectrum dominates within some range of accessible scales .",
    "we also found that the string - induced isw effect , unlike other non - gaussian models we tested , such as point sources , induces a significantly negative value of @xmath197 .",
    "this is a potential discriminator of string - induced perturbations .",
    "we intend to apply this method to characterize the non - gaussian features resulting from more realistic defect models .",
    "even if defects are unimportant as the underlying mechanism for structure formation , we could still apply these methods to detect their existence , especially when high - accuracy and high - resolution observations become available in the near future .",

    "<S> our numerical results suggest that detection of non - gaussian features by our method is reliable if the power spectrum of the non - gaussian components dominates that of the gaussian background and noise within at least a certain range of accessible scales . </S>"
