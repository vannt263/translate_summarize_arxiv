    "the nucleon mean - field potential or single - particle ( s / p ) potential is the most important quantity determining the s / p properties of neutrons and protons in the nuclear matter ( nm ) as well as in the finite nuclei @xcite , and it has been on the focus of recent many - body studies of the nm , like the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) calculations of the nm starting from a realistic choice of the free nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction @xcite or the mean - field studies of the nm on the hartree - fock ( hf ) level , using the different versions of the effective ( in - medium ) nn interaction @xcite .",
    "quite interesting aspect of the s / p potential is its direct connection with the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite , a key quantity necessary for the determination of the equation of state ( eos ) of the asymmetric nm @xcite .",
    "many microscopic studies of the eos were done based either on the nonrelativistic or relativistic mean - field potential given by realistic two - body and three - body nn forces or interaction lagrangians @xcite .",
    "such microscopic many - body studies did show the important role played by the pauli blocking effects as well as the increasing strength of the higher - order nn correlations at the high nm densities .",
    "these medium effects are usually considered as the main physics origin of an explicit density dependence embedded in the different versions of the effective nn interaction , being used currently in the hf calculations of the nuclear structure or nuclear reaction studies . among them , quite popular are the density dependent versions of the m3y interaction ( originally constructed to reproduce the g - matrix elements of the reid @xcite and paris @xcite nn potentials in an oscillator basis ) , which have been successfully used in the hf studies of the nm @xcite as well as in the folding model studies of the nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus scattering @xcite .    with the phenomenological density dependence of the m3y interaction parametrized to give a realistic description of the nm saturation properties @xcite within the hf frame , the hf nucleon optical potential ( or the high - momentum part of the s / p potential ) was used to determine the explicit energy dependence of the density dependent m3y interaction @xcite based on the observed energy dependence of the nucleon optical potential ( op ) .",
    "these density- and energy dependent versions of the m3y interaction have been further used in the folding model calculation of the nucleon - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus op @xcite . the simple assumption for the s / p potential in the nm made in refs .",
    "@xcite is roughly equivalent to the microscopic s / p potential of the brueckner - bethe theory @xcite , which lacks the so - called _ rearrangement _ term that arises naturally in the landau theory for the infinite fermi systems @xcite .",
    "such a rearrangement term ( rt ) also appears when the s / p potential is evaluated from the total nm energy using the hugenholtz and van hove ( hvh ) theorem @xcite , which is exact for all the interacting fermi systems , independent of the type of the interaction between fermions . for the infinite nm ,",
    "it is straightforward to see that the hvh theorem is satisfied on the hf level only when the in - medium nn interaction is density independent , i.e. , when the rt is equal zero @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , of high interest to assess the impact of the rt on the s / p potential in a mean - field study of the nm within the standard hf frame using a realistic density dependent nn interaction .",
    "moreover , given the fact that the nuclear symmetry energy and nucleon effective mass are directly linked to the momentum- and density dependence of the single - nucleon potential @xcite , it is highly desirable to have a method to take into account properly the density- and momentum dependence of the rt of the s / p potential on the hf level , which is the main motivation of the present study .",
    "it is further expected that , in a local density approximation , one should be able to include , in the same mean - field manner , the rt and momentum dependence of the density dependent nn interaction into the folding model calculation of the nucleon op for the finite nuclei , which is being evaluated so far mostly on the hf level @xcite . towards this goal ,",
    "an extension of the single - folding approach for the nucleon op @xcite has been done and applied to study the elastic neutron scattering on the lead target measured at the incident energies of 30.4 and 40 mev @xcite .",

    "<S> the nucleon mean - field potential has been thoroughly investigated in an extended hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation of nuclear matter ( nm ) using the cdm3y3 and cdm3y6 density dependent versions of the m3y interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle ( s / p ) energies of nucleons in nm are determined according to the hugenholtz - van hove theorem , which gives rise naturally to a rearrangement term ( rt ) of the s / p potential at the fermi momentum . using the rt obtained exactly at the different nm densities and neutron - proton asymmetries , </S>",
    "<S> a consistent method is suggested to take into account effectively the momentum dependence of the rt of the s / p potential within the standard hf scheme . to obtain a realistic momentum dependence of the nucleon optical potential ( op ) , </S>",
    "<S> the high - momentum part of the s / p potential was accurately readjusted to reproduce the observed energy dependence of the nucleon op over a wide range of energies . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the rt and momentum dependence of the s / p potential on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and nucleon effective mass has been studied in details . </S>",
    "<S> the high - momentum tail of the s / p potential was found to have a sizable effect on the slope of the symmetry energy and the neutron - proton effective mass splitting at supranuclear densities of the nm . </S>",
    "<S> based on a local density approximation , the folding model of the nucleon op of finite nuclei has been extended to take into account consistently the rt and momentum dependence of the nucleon op in the same mean - field manner , and successfully applied to study the elastic neutron scattering on the lead target at the energies around the fermi energy . </S>"
