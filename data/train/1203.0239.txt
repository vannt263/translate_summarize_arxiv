    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are characterized by strong energy output over a very broad frequency range , from the infrared to hard x - ray .",
    "although their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) has been studied for several decades , one of the main difficulties is the unobservable region between 0.01 kev and 0.2 kev , which is due to galactic and intrinsic photoelectric absorption . as a result",
    "most previous studies have focused mainly either on the uv / optical / infrared side or the soft / hard x - ray side , of the unobservable region .      in the optical band ,",
    "information about the agn can be derived from the balmer emission line series e.g. h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath9 , strong forbidden lines e.g. the [ oiii]@xmath84959/5007 doublets , and the optical underlying continuum .",
    "timing analysis of variations in the balmer lines via reverberation mapping study is the most reliable method to estimate agn black hole masses ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; peterson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "measurement of the [ oiii ] @xmath85007 emission line is used to provide an orientation independent estimate of the agn s central ionizing flux ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; heckman et al .",
    "2004 ; brinchmann et al . 2004 ; heckman et al .",
    "it is also a principal diagnostic of the properties of the narrow line region ( nlr ) , such as the stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. nelson & whittle 1995 ; nelson & whittle 1996 ; boroson 2003 ; greene & ho 2005 ) and outflow speed ( e.g. bian , yuan & zhao 2005 ; komossa et al .",
    "the underlying continuum in the optical is believed to be dominated by emission from the accretion disc ( koratkar & blaes 1999 ; jin et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter : paper - i ) and agn s host galaxy ( e.g. hao et al . 2010 ; landt et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the soft to hard x - ray emission is emitted from a compact region .",
    "the hard x - ray power law tail above 2 kev is produced by disc photons which are compton up - scattered by a hot , optically thin electron population ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1991 ; zdziarski , poutanen & johnson 2000 ) .",
    "however , the origin of the soft x - ray excess below 1 kev is still not clear ( e.g. gierliski & done 2004 ; done et al .",
    "2011 ; also see paper - i ) .",
    "significant absorption of the continuum by ionized gas located near to the central region ( i.e. the ` warm absorber ' ) can further complicate interpretation of the observed x - ray spectra ( reynolds 1997 ; crenshaw & kraemer 1999 ) .",
    "the infrared band especially beyond 2 @xmath10 m is believed to be dominated by emission from the dusty torus , and so provides information about its physical condition ( e.g. rees et al .",
    "1969 ; rieke 1978 ; lebofsky & reike 1980 ) . the observed 1 @xmath10 m minimum in the sed is also a common feature ( sanders et al . 1989 ) .",
    "recently , landt et al . (",
    "2011 ) showed that the continuum luminosity at 1 @xmath10 m can be used to estimate the agn black hole mass .",
    "many previous studies have attempted to construct agn broadband sed by combining multi - waveband observational data to model the emission across the uv - soft x - ray energy gap ( see references in paper - i ) .",
    "whichever method is used to construct the broadband sed , it is found that in almost all cases the sed peaks in the unobservable region ( rest - frame ) which encompasses the ` big blue bump ( bbb ) ' .",
    "one important consequence of this is that the unobservable region contains the largest fraction of an agn s radiated energy ( walter & fink 1993 ; grupe et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; paper - i ) .      in paper - i",
    ", we presented modelling results for a sample of 51 unobscured nearby type 1 agns .",
    "from the spectral fitting we derived numerous spectral parameters that were not contaminated by x - ray or optical obscuration . * in this paper , we investigate the link between the central ionization flux characterized by the unobscured hard x - ray , and the properties of the various optical emission lines and the continuum .",
    "we conduct this investigation by studying the profiles of various emission lines , and the luminosity correlations between the hard x - ray continuum and various optical emission features .",
    "*    narrow line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ) are often considered as a special type of agn whose permitted line width is comparable to other forbidden lines , and their [ oiii ] @xmath85007/h@xmath1 flux ratio is lower than is typical of normal seyfert 1s ( shuder & osterbrock 1981 ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) . the conventional definition for a nls1 is a seyfert 1 with h@xmath1 fwhm@xmath112000 km s@xmath12 and [ oiii ] @xmath85007/h@xmath1 @xmath113 ( goodrich 1989 ) .",
    "previous studies focused on such kind of seyfert galaxies and showed many intriguing characteristics .",
    "for example , nls1s were often found to have low black hole masses ( e.g. wang & lu 2001 ; bian & zhao 2004 ; zhou et al .",
    "2006 ; komossa & xu 2007 ; zhu , zhang & tang 2009 , hereafter : zhu09 ) .",
    "* these may be systematically lower than predicted by the m-@xmath13 relation which holds well for bls1s ( grupe & mathur 2004 ; mathur & grupe 2005 ) . *",
    "the nls1s also have high eddington ratios ( boroson 2002 ; komossa 2008 ; paper - i ) .",
    "it is thus proposed that nls1 s central black hole may still be growing ( e.g. mathur , kuraszkiewicz , & czerny 2001 ; komossa & mathur 2001 ; komossa 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , nls1s have softer 2 - 10 kev spectra , lower 2 - 10 kev luminosities , higher @xmath14 values and more energetic bbb ( see paper - i and references therein ) . in this paper , we continue to pay special attention to the nls1 subset in our sample and show how they behave differently from other sources in the cross - correlation study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review some most important characteristics of the sample in section 2 , in order to emphasize that our study conducted in the following sections should be related to the most intrinsic properties of agn s bare core .",
    "section 3 will present the ` optical to x - ray correlation spectrum ( oxcs ) ' based on our new ` correlation spectrum technique ( cst ) ' , from which various correlation features related to the hard x - ray luminosity are found in the optical spectrum .",
    "section 4 will study the cross - correlation between different balmer line components and broadband sed components .",
    "section 5 will focus on correlations related to the balmer line equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "section 6 will study the physical properties of different balmer emission line regions .",
    "[ oiii ] @xmath85007 line s property and its correlation with different sed components are put in section 7 .",
    "summary and conclusion will be made in section 8 . following paper - i",

    "<S> in this second paper in a series of three , we study the properties of the various emission features and underlying continuum in the optical spectra of type 1 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) by using the unobscured hard x - ray emission as a diagnostic . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the use of the ` correlation spectrum technique ' ( cst ) for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we use this to show the strength of correlation between the hard x - ray luminosity and each wavelength of the optical spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that for broad line seyfert 1s all the strong emission lines ( broad component of h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 , [ neiii ] @xmath23869/3967 , [ oi ] @xmath26300/6364 , [ oii ] @xmath23726/3729 , [ oiii ] @xmath24959/5007 ) and the optical underlying continuum all strongly correlate with the hard x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the narrow line seyfert 1s show stronger correlation of the optical continuum but weaker correlation in the lines .    </S>",
    "<S> a cross - correlation with luminosity between the various balmer line components and the broadband sed components shows that the best correlation exists between the hard x - ray component and broad component ( bc ) of the balmer lines . </S>",
    "<S> such a correlation is weaker for the intermediate ( ic ) and narrow components , which supports the view that broad line region ( blr ) has the closest link with the agn s compact x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent widths of balmer line ic and bc are found to correlate with l@xmath3 , @xmath4 , balmer line fwhm and black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> there is a non - linear dependence of the balmer line ic and bc luminosities with l@xmath3 and l@xmath5 , which suggests that a second - order factor such as the ilr and blr covering factors affect the balmer line component luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> the balmer decrement is found to decrease from @xmath65 in the line core to @xmath62 in the extended wings , with mean decrements of 2.1 in blr and 4.8 in ilr . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests different physical conditions in these regions , such as variations in electron density and dust abundance .    </S>",
    "<S> the [ oiii ] line is composed of a narrow core together with a blue - shifted component with average outflow velocity of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the total luminosity of [ oiii ] @xmath85007 shows the best correlation with the luminosity of hard x - ray emission , and so can be used to estimate the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of obscured agns . </S>",
    "<S> we use the cst to show the correlation of the [ oiii ] @xmath85007 luminosity with each wavelength of the full continuum sed . </S>",
    "<S> this shows as before that the [ oiii ] @xmath85007 strongly correlates with power law tail , but also that it correlates almost as strongly with the optical continuum from the disc , but not with the soft excess .    </S>",
