    "the distribution of host star obliquities @xmath0  the angle between a planet s orbital angular momentum and its host star s spin angular momentum  constrains hot jupiters origin .",
    "hot jupiters are thought to form at several au @xcite , reaching orbital periods @xmath1 of several days via : a ) high eccentricity migration , in which a jupiter s initially highly eccentric orbit shrinks and circularizes because of tidal dissipation in the planet , or b ) disk migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "mechanisms for the former produce a broad @xmath0 distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas the latter preserves @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , unless the disk or star becomes misaligned @xcite .",
    "rossiter - mclaughlin measurements of @xmath3 @xcite ( @xmath0 sky - projected ) could distinguish the mechanism of hot jupiter migration @xcite but @xmath0 is sculpted also by tidal dissipation in the star , through which the planet transfers angular momentum from its orbit to the star s spin .    from early obliquity measurements , @xcite ( fw09 hereafter ) inferred two hot jupiter populations : well - aligned and isotropic .",
    "subsequent discoveries linked them to host stars properties : hosts of misaligned jupiters have effective temperature @xmath4k ( @xcite , w10 hereafter ) and @xmath5 @xcite . among hosts with @xmath5 , those older than 2 - 2.5 gyr are aligned , the age at which such stars develop a significant convective envelope @xcite .",
    "w10 proposed that tidal dissipation is more efficient in cool stars with thick convective envelopes , allowing realignment .",
    "@xcite ( a12 hereafter ) confirmed the temperature break with a larger sample , constructed a tidal dissipation parameter , and demonstrated that misalignment is correlated with that parameter . to allow the realignment to occur on timescale shorter than the planet",
    "s orbital decay , w10 suggested that the convective envelopes of cool stars may be sufficiently decoupled from the radiative interior to be realigned separately . even without stronger dissipation",
    ", this decoupling would result in a much shorter timescale for the realignment of cool stars than hot stars .    in the w10 framework , only cool stars experience realignment of their convective envelopes .",
    "however , hot jupiters may also influence the outer layers of hot stars .",
    "hot stars have convective envelopes , which are thinner and therefore arguably easier to realign .",
    "for example , a hot jupiter has synchronized hot star ( @xmath6k ) @xmath7 bootis , accomplishable if the star has a thin convective envelope weakly coupled to the interior @xcite . a second obliquity trend , the mass cut - off for retrograde planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , may further be evidence that hot stars are not immune to their hot jupiters tidal influence .",
    "furthermore , attempts to reproduce the observed trends have resulted in major inconsistencies , such as a missing population of @xmath8 planets or too many oblique cool stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although individual systems are modeled successfully @xcite and @xmath3 correlates with the theoretical tidal realignment timescale ( a12,@xcite ) .        here",

    "i note that , particularly below @xmath9 , stars hosting more massive planets have larger rotation frequencies ( fig .",

    "the three lowest correspond to the most massive planets is @xmath20 ; below @xmath9 , the chance occurrence that of the nineteen @xmath21 , the two highest correspond to the most massive planets is @xmath22 .",
    "these formal estimates of significance do not account for the variety of other patterns we might have observed . ] , which lowers their true significance .    as a12 showed ( fig .",
    "20 ) , because @xmath9 for @xmath3 is also a cut - off for @xmath23 ( or , plotted here , @xmath24 ) , it may correspond to the magnetic braking cut - off .",
    "this cut - off is equivalent to gyrochronological kraft break for stellar rotation period versus color @xcite .",
    "braking is thought to be strongest for stars with thick convective envelopes @xcite .",
    "therefore a12 interpreted the correspondence of @xmath9 for @xmath25 and @xmath0 as evidence that strong dissipation in the convective envelope plays a role in spin - orbit alignment .",
    "i will later argue that magnetic braking , rather than the tidal dissipation efficiency or the participation of the convective envelope versus entire star in tidal realignment , is the cause of @xmath9 for @xmath0 .",

    "strong magnetic braking , slows the rotation and lowers the spin angular momentum , allowing the planet to realign the star s outer layer without synchronization .",
    "both hot and cool stars require a @xmath45 30 - 100 times lower than the star s",
    "total @xmath113 . for cool stars ,",
    "magnetic braking shrinks the star s spin vector without changing the direction , so a small @xmath45 allows a smidgen of orbital decay to nudge the star to realignment . for hot stars",
    ", a small @xmath45 allows sufficiently massive planets to flip from retrograde to prograde , producing the observed retrograde planetary mass cut - off .",
    "finally , more massive planets partially overcome magnetic braking to spin up the star , leading to the observed planet - mass - stratification of host star rotation frequency for cool stars .",
    "there are several caveats .",
    "the observed trends with planet mass are less robust than that with stellar effective temperature due to the rarity of massive hot jupiters",
    ". therefore rossiter - mclaughlin measurements of newly discovered hot jupiters with @xmath114 would be particularly valuable .",
    "i assumed that the initial @xmath0 distribution is independent of @xmath44 ; if the retrograde mass - cut were caused by the mechanism leading to misalignment , a small @xmath45 for hot stars would not be necessary .",
    "furthermore , whether such a small @xmath45  an outer layer participating in the tidal realignment while weakly coupled to the interior  is plausible remains an open question .",
    "as proposed by w10 , this weakly coupled outer layer could be the convective zone .",
    "following w10 , i compute the convective zone @xmath113 of a 5 gyr sun - like star and a 2 gyr 1.2 solar - mass star using the ez web stellar evolution models @xcite : @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "the latter is consistent with the value estimated here ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the former is inconsistent with the estimated value @xmath118 using nominal parameters and marginally consistent with @xmath119 if i allow cool stars to have a much shorter orbital decay timescale .",
    "the weakly coupled outer layer does not necessarily correspond to the convective zone , just an effective distance for the transferred angular momentum to penetrate . a weakly coupled outer layer would account @xmath7 bootis  b synchronizing its hot star . for cool stars",
    ", a weakly coupled outer layer seems at odds with the sun s radially uniform rotation profile .",
    "one possibility is that the weakly coupled outer layer corresponds to our sun s near - surface shear outer layer at about 0.95@xmath120 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is decoupled from the rest of the convective zone at low latitudes .",
    "the depth from the surface probed by @xmath3 and @xmath17 measurements is @xmath121 km ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is that the timescale for coupling between layers , often treated as a free parameter in tidal evolution models due to uncertainty over which proposed physical process is responsible for coupling ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is much longer than the tidal forcing timescale .",
    "i used a simplistic tidal evolution model to illuminate an origin for the observed stellar obliquity trends .",
    "ultimately a detailed , realistic treatment is necessary , incorporating stellar evolution ( accounting for age trends , i.e. @xcite ) , coupling between the star s layers , changes in @xmath46 , dynamic tides , stellar properties affecting tides ( e.g. , @xmath18 , and tides raised on the planet .",
    "the values of physical constants i tuned to match observations such as the braking coefficient and initial host star spin rate  are not precise constraints due to the model s simplistic treatment , but better models may allow meaningful constraints . for example , a constraint on the initial host star spin rate could pinpoint the star s age when the realignment begins , potentially distinguishing between disk migration ( which occurs before the gas disk evaporates ) versus high eccentricity migration ( which delivers the hot jupiter over a larger range of timescales ) .    a key take - away for using the @xmath0 distribution to constrain hot jupiter migration mechanisms",
    "is that cool star obliquities are significantly sculpted by tides , as are hot star obliquities for the more massive hot jupiters .",
    "for example , if one were to take the @xmath0 distribution of hot stars as pristine , one would overestimate the fraction of prograde planets due to the flipping of massive retrograde planets .",
    "better tidal evolution models will allow robustly forward - modeling the migration and tidal sculpting process to match the observed distribution of sky - projected @xmath3 .",
