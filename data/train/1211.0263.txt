    "porosity together with understanding of hydrodynamic forces in a corrugated nanochannel could be used to take advantage of size - dependent transport properties  @xcite and separation  @xcite of nanofluids  @xcite .    the first analytical results on steady - state drag on a permeable homogeneous sphere date back to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since then , numerous works @xcite have been published on drag force and torque on spherical particles of different mass distributions and internal structure .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated a porous shell of finite thickness .",
    "recently , @xcite solved a related problem where the shell was wrapped around a solid core .",
    "so far , studies on the subject have largely comprised theoretical calculations in the stokes approximation of the navier - stokes equation .    in this work ,",
    "we first compare the results of such calculations of steady - state quantities to computer simulations of the navier - stokes equations by the well - established lattice - boltzmann method ( lb ) .",
    "we will show that our simulations give quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions without any adjustable fitting parameters at all levels of permeability for the steady - state case .",
    "we then examine the dynamic case in which additional complications arise as the particle moves in the fluid in an oscillatory manner .",

    "@xcite generalized the original @xcite result of the hydrodynamic force on a sinusoidally oscillating solid particle with a no - slip boundary condition .",
    "they formulated the problem such that changes in both the velocity and acceleration - dependent part of the dynamic force could be quantified as the frequency of the oscillation , the porosity of the particle or as the boundary condition on the surface of the particle was changed . in the high - porosity limit , where the brinkmann @xmath2 parameter tends to zero ,",

    "inside @xmath19 , the fluid flow interacts directly with the nodes and ( [ eq : feom ] ) is referred to as the dbb equation  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the particle @xmath19 can be varied to give a shell , uniform - density sphere or other distribution .",
    "the product @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23  @xcite , where @xmath24 is the hydrodynamic screening length and @xmath25 is the constant permeability of the particle .",
    "the dbb equation is a mean - field description of fluid flow in the porous particle under the assumption that the particle radius @xmath26 is large enough compared to the mean pore size @xmath27 .",

    "this is necessary in order to resolve the spherical shape as the value of the coupling constant @xmath14 is increased away from the free - draining limit . the uniform - density sphere ( [ eq : nsphere ] ) and the shell of finite thickness ( [ eq : nannulus ] ) discussed below",

    "this approximation will be relevant for what follows so we treat it here in more detail .",
    "@xcite arrived at ( [ eq : ssspherefapprox ] ) directly by assuming darcy s law ( see text below ( [ eq : forcedensity ] ) ) to apply in the form @xmath106on the surface @xmath40 . by matching the pressure based on ( [ eq : darcy ] ) and that based on the stream function for a solid sphere ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , they found @xmath107 and hence they called @xmath108 the permeation coefficient .",
    "this shows that the function @xmath109 appears due to the laplacian term of ( [ eq : feomb ] ) included in the brinkman model but not in the darcy model , which is also apparent from the explicit calculation of @xcite .",

    "felderhof and deutch s work is significant in that they considered more general density distribution than @xmath124 in ( [ eq : nsphere ] ) .",
    "in particular , they considered  @xcite _ an infinitesimally thin shell _ for which the node density is given by @xmath125where @xmath126 is the uniform surface density .",
    "such shells are of particular interest in biophysical problems such as leaky vesicles and encapsulated drug delivery .",
    "they calculated the shell to experience a drag force and torque equal to    [ eq : ssshell ] @xmath127    in the same setting that gave ( [ eq : ssspheref ] ) and ( [ eq : ssspheret ] ) for the uniform - density sphere .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath2 in ( [ eq : ssshell ] ) is still equal to @xmath128 , where @xmath18 from ( [ eq : nsphere ] ) guarantees correct units .",
    "the small difference between ( [ eq : ssspherefapprox ] ) and ( [ eq : ssshellf ] ) suggests that a low - porosity shell and sphere ( large @xmath2 ) might be difficult to distinguish from one another based on drag force .",

    "we refer to this limit as saturating @xmath2 since it requires @xmath14 to be increased until impermeability is reached numerically .",

    "if one chooses a value for @xmath2 below saturation , one may only claim to be simulating a porous particle of the chosen node density @xmath17 .",
