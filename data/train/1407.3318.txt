    "a sensitive test for new physics are the processes of the top quark due to large mass .",
    "the predictions of the standard model ( sm ) for the top quark in flavor changing neutral ( fcn ) transitions are strongly suppressed @xcite as a result of the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , rare decays with branching ratios ( br ) of order @xmath5-@xmath6 may be detectable , depending on the signal .",
    "any hint for new top quark physics at lhc would motivate further study at the next generation of collider experiments @xcite .",
    "recent discovery of a sm - like higgs boson with a mass near 125 - 126 gev @xcite has generated new motivations to study the extended higgs sector .",
    "the two higgs doublet model ( 2thdm ) is one of the simplest extensions of the sm , adding a second higgs doublet with the same quantum numbers as the first one .",
    "the versions that involve natural flavor conservation and cp conservation in the potential through the introduction of a discrete symmetry , are known as 2hdm - i @xcite and 2hdm - ii @xcite . a general version which is named as 2hdm - iii allows the presence of flavor - changing neutral scalar interactions ( fcnsi ) at a three level @xcite .",
    "there are also some variants ( known as top , lepton , neutrino ) , where one higgs doublet couples predominantly to one type of fermion @xcite , while in other models it is even possible to identify a candidate for dark matter @xcite .",
    "the definition of all these models , depends on the yukawa structure and symmetries of the higgs sector , whose origin is still not known .",
    "the possible appearance of new sources of cp violation is another characteristic of these models @xcite .    within 2hdm - i where only one higgs doublet generates all gauge and fermion masses , while the second doublet only knows about this through mixing , and thus the higgs phenomenology will share some similarities with the sm , although the sm higgs couplings will now be shared among the neutral scalar spectrum .",
    "the presence of a charged higgs boson is clearly the signal beyond the sm . within 2hdm - ii one",
    "also has natural flavor conservation @xcite , and its phenomenology will be similar to the 2hdm - i , although in this case the sm couplings are shared not only because of mixing , but also because of the yukawa structure .",
    "the distinctive characteristic of 2hdm - iii is the presence of fcnsi , which require a certain mechanism in order to suppress them , for instance one can imposes a certain texture for the yukawa couplings @xcite , which will then predict a pattern of fcnsi higgs couplings @xcite . within all those models ( 2hdm i , ii , iii ) @xcite , the higgs doublets couple , in principle , with all fermion families , with a strength proportional to the fermion masses , modulo other parameters .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the the br for the decay @xmath7 in the framework of the general 2hdm .",
    "given @xmath8 and @xmath9 two complex @xmath10 doublet scalar fields with hypercharge - one , the most general gauge invariant and renormalizable higgs scalar potential is @xcite @xmath11    \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda _ { 1}\\left ( \\phi _ { 1}^{+}\\phi _ { 1}\\right ) ^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda _ { 2}\\left ( \\phi _ { 2}^{+}\\phi _ { 2}\\right ) ^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\lambda _ { 3}\\left ( \\phi _ { 1}^{+}\\phi _ { 1}\\right ) \\left ( \\phi _ { 2}^{+}\\phi _ { 2}\\right ) + \\lambda _ { 4}\\left ( \\phi _ { 1}^{+}\\phi _ { 2}\\right ) \\left ( \\phi _ { 2}^{+}\\phi _ { 1}\\right )    \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda _ { 5}\\left ( \\phi _ { 1}^{+}\\phi _ { 2}\\right ) ^{2}+\\lambda _ { 6}\\left ( \\phi _ { 1}^{+}\\phi _ { 1}\\right ) \\left ( \\phi _ { 1}^{+}\\phi _ { 2}\\right ) \\right .",

    "now , the most general @xmath22-conserving vacuum expectation values are @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are real and non - negative , @xmath27 , and @xmath28    in eq .",

    "thus , the cp violation is explicit in the scalar potential .",
    "the neutral components of the scalar higgs fields in the interaction basis can be written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denote the real part .",

    "the neutral higgs bosons @xmath39 are defined to satisfy the masses hierarchy given by the inequalities @xmath47 @xcite . for the thdm with no cp violation in scalar sector the @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "are mixed in a @xmath50 matrix and the mass eigenstates are cp - even while @xmath51 is not mixed and has cp - odd symmetry . in this case the @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath51 are equivalent to neutral scalar @xmath54 , @xmath55 and psedoscalar @xmath56 in the 2hdm type i , ii or iii , respectively . by breaking the cp symmetry in higgs sector the fields @xmath57 do not have well defined the cp states . for the yukawa interactions between fermions and scalars fields the most general structure are @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the @xmath60 yukawa matrices .",

    "the zero superscript in fermions fields stands for non mass eigenstates . after getting a correct spontaneous symmetry breaking by using ( [ vev1 ] ) and ( [ vev2 ] ) ,",
    "the mass matrices become @xmath66 where @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath69 matrices are used to diagonalize the fermions mass matrices and relate the physical and weak states    in order to study the rare top decay we are interested in up - type quarks fields . by using equations ( [ h - rn ] )",
    ", the interactions between neutral higgs bosons and fermions can be written in the form of the 2hdm type ii with additional contributions which arise from yukawa couplings @xmath70 and contain flavor change . from now on",
    ", we will omit the subscript 1 in yukawa couplings to simplify the notation .",
    "therefore , the interactions for up - type quarks and neutral higgs bosons are explicitly written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 the fermion spinors are denoted as @xmath74 .",
    "note that latin indices in ( [ ak ] ) and ( [ bk ] ) denote the three neutral higgs bosons meanwhile latin indices in spinors , yukawa matrix or mass matrix are for flavor of the up - type quarks .",
    "the cp conserving case is obtained if only two neutral higgs bosons are mixed with well - defined cp states , for instance for @xmath75 is the usual limit .",
    "we are interested in the contributions of the flavor changing neutral scalar interactions to the rare top decay @xmath76 which come from previous yukawa interactions . for the partial width of the decay @xmath76 , using eq .",

    "therefore , the branching ratio can be written as @xmath85 the above expression contains too many free parameters of the model , such as the masses last expression contains several free parameters of the thdm , such as the masses of neutral higgs bosons and the mixing parameter @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the next section",
    "the parameters are treated to study the rare top decay @xmath76 .",
    "first we will discuss the free parameters involved in the process .",
    "the yukawa couplings in the thdm - iii are responsible for the fcnsi as shown the expression ( [ yukawa_quarks ] ) .",
    "one possible option to suppress these fcnsi is obtained by assuming an ansantz for the yukawa couplings .",
    "we take into account the ansantz proposed by cheng - sher @xcite .",
    "this ansatz assumes a specific structure for the yukawa matrix given by @xmath88 .    for the masses of neutral scalar @xmath39 we set the mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath89 equal to the value of the mass of the observed scalar reported by atlas and cms , @xmath90 gev @xcite .",
    "the masses of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 are fixed as 300 gev and 600 gev , respectively .",
    "if neutral scalar fields have greater values of masses , then their contribution to the @xmath93 will be negligible .",
    "therefore , the set of the free parameters in the partial width ( [ width ] ) is reduced only to the mixing angles @xmath94 . in order to analyze the branching ratio for rare top decay @xmath76 we consider allowed regions for the mixing parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the numerical results show that under above assumptions the branching ratio ( [ br ] ) does not have significant contributions from @xmath97 mixing parameter in the interval @xmath98 .",
