    "since the seminal contributions by richard feynman in 1948 , it is clear that the description of quantum and quantum statistical systems can be based either on wave - functions and the schrdinger equation , or on the path integral prescription for computing the propagator and/or the partition function .",
    "both descriptions are equivalent : given a certain schrdinger equation , the corresponding path integral can be formulated , and , alternatively , a path integral expression can be used to define a quantum theory . in particular , the latter route appears to have advantages in complex many - body systems and for field theories .",
    "these topics are , of course , well documented in several textbooks , for example , by feynman and hibbs @xcite , schulman @xcite , sakita @xcite , and kleinert @xcite . in order to set the stage , consider e.g.  the partition function of a simple quantum system , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the euclidean action , @xmath2=\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\big [ \\frac{m}{2}{\\dot x}^2+v(x)\\big ] \\ ; .\\ ] ] as usual , @xmath3 is the mass of the particle , @xmath4 the potential , and @xmath5 .",
    "the symbol @xmath6 is a short - hand notation for a multi - dimensional integral , defined through a discretisation of the interval @xmath7 , by putting @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 , in the limit @xmath12 , @xmath13 so that @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the temperature ) remains finite . with an appropriate deformation of the time - integration contour , and adding appropriate source fields , eq .",

    "note that , when evaluating the multi - dimensional integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the correct integration measure is essential  and that appropriate paths have to be taken into account : for the propagator , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are to be kept fixed , while for the partition function , @xmath18 with an additional integration with respect to this variable ( since @xmath19 is a trace ) .    in a more general situation ,",
    "say , in which the potential is velocity dependent ( as for a charged particle ) it is essential to choose the correct discrete representation , which is known as the mid - point prescription , i.e.   @xmath20 this prescription ensures that the corresponding hamiltonian operator contains the symmetric form @xmath21 , and hence its hermiticity .",
    "( the physically relevant case for this example is , of course , in three dimensions . )",
    "a closely related problem appears in the theory of brownian motion , in particular , for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , defined by the langevin equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents gaussian white noise ( with zero average ) . considering the generalisation where @xmath24 is replaced by some function @xmath25 , and starting from the gaussian probability density for the noise , it is straightforward to derive the probability density for the random process @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) : @xmath28 the result is unique , as is the corresponding fokker - planck equation ; the intermediate steps , however , depend on the discretisation procedure , the two cases discussed in this context being connected with the names ito ( forward rule ) and stratonovich ( mid - point rule ) @xcite . in the former , the jacobian of the transformation is a mere constant , but the integral of @xmath29 has a non - trivial contribution ; in the latter , the integral of @xmath29 depends only on the end - points  but care is needed to evaluate the jacobian .",
    "physically , this difficulty is related to the irregularity of the brownian motion , and hence can be cured , for example , by introducing a finite mass term @xmath30 into eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "a concise discussion of the question of operator ordering and functional formulations in both quantum and stochastic dynamics can be found in @xcite ; the arguments given above , to the best of our knowledge , were first formulated by schmid @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "until now , we implicitly assumed that the hamilton operator of the system in question is given  and we will make the same assumption in the following sections , as we have in mind applications to condensed matter physics .",
    "we would mention , however , that a more general question is ( still ) studied intensively in mathematical physics : given a classical hamiltonian function , what is the `` correct '' quantum theory ?",
    "for an introduction to related topics , see , for example , @xcite ; in this connection , the concept of weyl ordering ( @xcite , chap .",
    "vi , and @xcite ; see also below ) is useful : as is well known , a weyl ordered hamiltonian corresponds to a path integral defined by the mid - point rule . in complex many - body systems",

    "[ model ] , we briefly recapitulate the essence of the feynman - vernon @xcite caldeira - leggett @xcite model , which is based on the assumption that , in a complex many - body system , a suitable coordinate ( `` particle '' ) can be identified ; and that this particle is weakly coupled to the remaining degrees of freedom ( `` bath '' ) .",
    "the choice of the coupling and the bath , the latter typically assumed to be a set of harmonic oscillators , depends on the problem under consideration : in particular , the choice which corresponds to an effective dissipation has attracted considerable attention ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . the following sect .",

    "a phase - dependent mass ( i.e.  capacitance in this case ) is found in the effective action @xcite ; see also @xcite . in the central sect .",

    "we briefly review some classical aspects , and discuss the relation between operator ordering and path integral formulation . using the ( discrete ) path integral formulation as well as perturbation theory and a variational approach",

    "we have chosen the form of the coupling above so that certain counter terms are avoided .",
    "for the next step , it is important that the coupling , @xmath39 , is linear in the bath variables @xmath40 , in order to allow them to be integrated out easily .",
    "( we could , of course , have chosen a coupling to the momenta @xmath41 as well . ) performing the integration , one finds an effective action which contains the particle variable only ; the properties of the bath and the particle - bath coupling are absorbed in a certain correlation function .",

    "( [ eq13 ] ) .",
    "the starting point is the bcs model of superconductivity , i.e.  electrons which weakly attract each other .",
    "two of these bcs superconductors are weakly coupled by the tunneling hamiltonian @xcite , which allows for electron transfer from one superconductor to the other . in the first step , within the path integral formulation ,",
    "complex order parameter fields are introduced to decouple the attractive interaction .",
    "similarly , the coulomb interaction between charges near the junction surfaces , which becomes an effective capacitive interaction , is described by a voltage field . in an intermediate step ,",
    "we obtain a form which is bilinear in the four - dimensional ( left / right , spin - up / spin - down ) space of the fermionic ( grassmann ) variables . in the second step ,",
    "the fermionic fields are integrated out . in addition , it is advantageous to perform a gauge transformation which makes the particle - hole off - diagonal elements real and reveals the role of the order parameter phases . in a third step ,",
    "the action is expanded ( up to second order ) in the tunnel matrix elements .",
    "based on a detailed analysis of the different contributions one can show that the effective low - frequency action , which is a functional of the phase difference @xmath70 across the junction , is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72\\ ] ] contains the capacitive energy ( capacitance : @xmath73 ) as well as the contribution from the external current ( @xmath74 ) , and @xmath75 \\ ; .\\ ] ] here we use the same notation as in @xcite .",

    "considering zero temperature and slow variations ( compared to the inverse gap frequency ) in time , we may use the expansions @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 are all positive ; @xmath85 is irrelevant ) to show that the @xmath83-term leads to the usual cosine potential , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the josephson coupling energy ; and that the @xmath82- and @xmath84-contributions change the capacitance ( i.e.  the `` mass '' ) according to @xmath88 where @xmath89 ; @xmath90 is the superconducting gap , assuming the two superconductors to be equal , and @xmath91 the normal - state resistance of the junction .",
    "the above model , often  for simplicity  considered in the limit @xmath92 , is also a good starting point for discussing the quantum properties of an array of josephson junctions , for example the quantum dynamics of a vortex @xcite : in this case , a position - dependent mass arises due to the lattice structure of the underlying array of superconducting grains . , with @xmath93 and @xmath31 to be identified , thus requiring a different interpretation of the path integral ; see e.g.  @xcite , chap . 23 . ]    considering again eq .",

    "however , on the quantum level , we have not been able to confirm the assertion that an effective low - energy theory can be formulated in which the coupling to the environment and the properties of the environment are expressed through the coordinate - dependent mass alone .",
    "this becomes apparent when considering the ( discrete ) path integral formulation , since high - frequency contributions to the effective action can not simply be discarded .",
    "consistently , it is easily seen in perturbation theory that due to the non - linearity , significant and model - dependent contributions arise which reflect the back - action of the particle on the environment .",
    "ue particularly acknowledges the close and fruitful cooperation , as well as many discussions on some aspects of this work , with vinay ambegaokar and gerd schn .",
