    "multi - dimensional coherent spectroscopy ( mdcs ) is an ultra - fast spectroscopy technique that unfolds spectral information onto several dimensions to correlate absorption , mixing , and emission frequencies .",
    "originally developed for nuclear magnetic resonance experiments @xcite , mdcs was brought to the optical domain @xcite .",
    "in addition to molecules , this powerful technique has been very successfully applied to semiconductor heterostructures such as quantum wells @xcite , or atomic vapors @xcite .",
    "mdcs enables the separation of homogeneous and inhomogeneous line widths of a resonance @xcite , the characterization of single and two - quantum coherences @xcite , and the study of the role played by many - body interactions @xcite .",
    "it is also an ideal tool to study coupling between transitions , such as excitons confined in separated qws @xcite or quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite .",
    "however , conventional mdcs techniques rely on the wave - vector selection of the fwm signal based on phase matching .",
    "this selection only applies in 2d or 3d systems such as atomic vapors , semiconductor qws , or dense ensembles of nano - objects @xcite .",
    "thus , conventional techniques can not be applied to sub - wavelength structures where the translational symmetry is broken , such as individual ( or small ensembles of ) qds , or other single nano - objects . in this case ,",
    "radiation by point sources prevents the formation of a well defined fwm beam in the phase matched direction .",
    "so far , only a sophisticated heterodyne mixing technique has been demonstrated to provide access to fwm of single qds @xcite , relying on assumptions made about the phase evolution of a reference resonance in order to phase individual one - dimensional spectra .    here",
    "we present a mdcs technique that enables measurement of fwm signals from nanostructures without relying on wave - vector selection of the signal .",
    "the approach measures the fwm signal via photocurrent readout and is suitable for any sample with which electrical contacts can be made , including single nano - objects .",
    "advantages of the method include the intrinsic measurement of the fwm amplitude and phase , and a natural reduction of the impact of mechanical fluctuations , allowing us to achieve sufficient phase stability without active stabilization . as a proof of principle ,",
    "2d photocurrent spectra of excitons confined in a double ingaas qw are presented .",
    "mdcs is an extension of fwm experiments . in conventional mdcs",
    "a sequence of three pulses is sent to the sample , and the radiated fwm is heterodyned with a local oscillator for phase resolution and detected by a spectrometer .",
    "inter - pulse delays are precisely stepped , and the data is then fourier transformed with respect to these delays to obtain multi - dimensional spectra .",
    "this scheme has been implemented in various geometries .",
    "a common one is the pump - probe geometry , where the phase - locked delay between first and second pulses is achieved using pulse - shaping methods , and the signal is self - heterodyned with the transmitted probe serving as the local oscillator @xcite .",
    "the drawbacks of the pump - probe method are that only the real part ( not the amplitude ) of the correlation spectrum can be obtained , and delays are limited to about 10 ps ( shorter than coherence and population times in semiconductor materials ) .",
    "another implementation of conventional mdcs is the box geometry @xcite .",
    "this geometry enables separation of rephasing and non - rephasing contributions @xcite , the characterization of two - quantum coherences @xcite , and can provide longer inter - pulse delays if active stabilization is used @xcite .",
    "however , mdcs in the box geometry requires additional procedures to obtain real and imaginary parts of the multidimensional spectra @xcite .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , non - collinear geometries can not be used to study single or few zero - dimensional objects .",
    "mdcs using collinear geometry has been demonstrated , based either on phase cycling algorithms @xcite or selection of the fwm signal in the frequency domain @xcite . in the present work , we use a collinear geometry where four pulses are sent to the sample .",
    "pulses are denoted a , b , c , and d ( in the chronological order at which they hit the sample ) and the corresponding inter - pulse delays are denoted @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "[ figure_setup ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the role of the fourth pulse is to convert the third order polarization into a fourth order population that we detect in the form of a photocurrent signal .",
    "the fwm signal is isolated in the frequency domain , using an approach similar to that developed by tekavec _",
    "et al _ , where the fourth order population generated in an atomic vapor was detected in the form of a fluorescence signal @xcite .",
    "the four - pulse sequence is generated by sending the beam of a mode - locked ti : sapph oscillator ( coherent mira - 76 mhz repetition rate @xcite ) into a set of two mach - zehnder interferometers nested within a larger mach - zehnder interferometer ( fig .",
    "[ figure_setup ] ( b ) ) .",
    "three translation stages are used to control inter - pulse delays @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "each interferometer arm contains an acoustic optical modulator ( aom ) ( isomet 1205c-1 ) driven by a phase - locked direct digital synthesizer ( analog devices ad9959 ) . in each arm the 0@xmath3 diffraction order of the aom is spatially blocked and the 1@xmath4 order beam is used .",
    "each aom tags the beams with a unique radio frequency @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting non - linear signals oscillate at radio frequencies given by sums and differences of the aom frequencies .     and",
    "@xmath7 are the in - phase and in - quadrature outputs of the lock - in amplifier , corresponding to the real and imaginary parts of the two - wave mixing signal @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the field amplitude . @xmath10 and @xmath7 oscillate with @xmath0 at the reduced frequency @xmath11 @xmath12 3.5 thz ( see text ) .",
    "( b ) fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the complex signal . as the detector is broadband , @xmath13 ( red curve ) provides the power spectrum of the laser .",
    "the spectral phase is given by @xmath14 ( blue dots ) .",
    "a normalized spectrum of the excitation laser , recorded with an ocean optics usb 4000 spectrometer @xcite , is plotted for comparison ( green circles).,width=453 ]    as a simple example , the photocurrent signal obtained from a combination of pulses a and b oscillates at the difference frequency ( beat note ) @xmath15 .",
    "dual phase lock - in detection is used to isolate and demodulate this signal .",
    "a continuous wave ( cw ) laser ( external cavity diode laser , @xmath16 = 941.5 ) runs through the same optics as the excitation laser , but is vertically offset from the path of the excitation laser . the beat note resulting from its interference , recorded by reference photodetectors ( ref1 for arms a and b on fig .",
    "1 ( b ) ) serves as a reference for lock - in detection of the signal .",
    "this detection scheme provides several advantages : ( 1 ) the bandpass filtering around the beat note frequency achieved by the lock - in ensures that detected signal results from a wave - mixing process where pulses a and b contribute once each .",
    "other contributions ( single pulse contributions , noise at mechanical vibration frequencies , dark current ) are filtered out by the lock - in .",
    "( 2 ) the phase of the signal is correlated to the phase of the excitation pulses , providing a direct , intrinsic access to the complex signal z = x + iy from the dual phase lock - in amplifier output . ( 3 ) when stepping delay @xmath0 , the signal phase at the lock - in output does not evolve at an optical frequency , but at a reduced frequency @xmath17 given by the difference between the signal and cw laser optical frequencies .",
    "this `` physical undersampling '' of the signal results in a smaller number of points required to sample the signal , and in an improvement of the signal - to - noise ratio : the impact of a mechanical fluctuation in the setup , corresponding to a delay fluctuation @xmath18 , scales as @xmath19 @xcite . in other words , the cw laser senses and partially compensates for phase noise resulting from optical path fluctuations occurring in the setup . as a consequence , it is important to choose a cw laser wavelength as close as possible to the signal wavelength . with this technique ,",
    "large inter - pulse delays are achievable ( limited only by the coherence length of the cw laser or , as in our case , by the length of the delay stages ) .",
    "this is particularly useful for the spectroscopy of semiconductor nanostructures such as qds , where coherence times can be of the order of the nanosecond @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ figure_autocorr ] the measurement to determine zero delay between pulses a and b. for this , we substitute for the sample with a broadband commercial detector ( thorlabs det10a si detector @xcite ) . stepping the delay @xmath0 , we perform a field auto - correlation of the excitation pulse .",
    "the signal , oscillating in real time at the frequency @xmath20 , is demodulated by the lock - in detection scheme . figure [ figure_autocorr ] ( a ) shows the in - phase and in - quadrature components of the signal , provided by the lock - in outputs x and y , respectively , and the signal amplitude r. x and y , shifted by 90@xmath21 , evolve with the stepping of @xmath0 at the reduced frequency @xmath22 @xmath12 3.5 thz .",
    "since the phase and amplitude of the signal are known , a fourier transform with respect to @xmath0 provides us with the one - dimensional power spectrum and spectral phase of the excitation laser ( fig .",
    "[ figure_autocorr ] ( b ) ) .    in a similar way ,",
    "the four pulses can be used to generate a fwm signal , and the delays @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be stepped to record 2d or 3d data , which can be fourier transformed with respect to each delay to produce multi - dimensional spectra .",
    "the most typical 2d spectrum in conventional mdcs is obtained by stepping delays @xmath0 and @xmath2 while keeping @xmath1 at a constant value . to produce the appropriate lock - in reference for the fwm signal , we detect the beat notes @xmath20 and @xmath23 on two separate photodetectors ( ref1 and ref2 in fig .",
    "[ figure_setup ] ( b ) ) .",
    "these beat frequencies are mixed digitally using a digital signal processor ( dsp ) ( sigmastudios adau1761z @xcite ) . the mixing algorithm ( in - quadrature mixing ) is as follows : the beat notes are input into the dsp , where they independently undergo a hilbert transform .",
    "then we make use of the identity @xmath24 .",
    "this provides reference frequencies @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the lock - in detection of the photocurrent fwm signal .",
    "these frequencies are analogous to the phase - matched directions @xmath27 and @xmath28 of non - collinear mdcs , corresponding to the so - called rephasing ( or @xmath29 ) and non - rephasing ( or @xmath30 ) pulse sequences , respectively . in the box geometry ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 need to be recorded separately since they correspond to a different pulse sequence , while with frequency domain selection @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be recorded simultaneously on two separate lock - in amplifiers .",
    "it is also possible to detect two - quantum ( or @xmath31 ) signals that oscillate at the radio frequency @xmath32 . the reference frequency that allows demodulation of such a signal",
    "can not be generated from reference detectors ref1 and ref2 .",

    "the double qw consists in a 4.8 nm thick qw and a 8 nm thick qw , separated by a barrier of 4 nm thickness .",
    "an au - ni - ge bottom contact was deposited on the n - doped substrate .",
    "a top contact ( 5 nm ti and 200 nm au ) was deposited on part of the sample surface .",
    "the sample was kept at a temperature of 15.5k in a cold finger liquid helium cryostat . in order to deal with the sample capacitance ,",
    "a `` bootstrap '' trans - impedance circuit @xcite was used to convert the photocurrent from the sample into a voltage that is read by the lock - in amplifiers ( stanford research srs830 @xcite ) input ( fig . [ figure_electronics ] ) .",

    "figure [ figure_2d ] shows 2d spectra that were recorded from the sample .",
    "a forward bias @xmath41 = 0.5 v , for which we obtain the strongest fwm signal , was applied through the bootstrap circuit ( see fig . [ figure_electronics ] ) .",

    "an auxiliary cw laser runs through the same optics as the excitation laser to partially compensate for mechanical fluctuations occurring in the setup , enabling optical mdcs without the need of active stabilization .",
    "long inter - pulse delays can be achieved ( only limited by the coherence length of the cw laser or the length of the delay stages ) , particularly adapted to the long coherence and population times of excitations in semiconductor materials . demonstrated on an ingaas double qw structure , the technique can be extended to the mdcs of single nano - objects , since it does not rely on the wave - vector selection of the fwm signal . considering that photocurrent measurements have been reported in single qds @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , and nanowires @xcite , the multidimensional coherent optical photocurrent spectroscopy ( md - cops ) technique can be applied on all of these types of single nanostructures .",
