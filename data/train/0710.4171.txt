    "multiuser detectors for code division multiple access ( cdma ) receivers are effective techniques to eliminate the multiple access interference ( mai ) . in cdma systems ,",
    "all users receive the whole transmitted signals concurrently that are recognized by their specific pseudo noise ( pn ) sequences . in such a system",
    ", there exists a limit for the number of users that are able to simultaneously communicate .",
    "this limitation is because of the mai generated by other users ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "high quality detectors improve the capacity of these systems @xcite .",
    "however their computational complexities grow exponentially with increasing the number of users and the length of the transmitted sequence @xcite .",
    "multiple stage subtractive interference cancelation is a suboptimal solution with reduced computational complexity . in this method and before making data decisions , the estimated interference from other users are removed from the specific user s received signal .",
    "the cancelation can be carried out either in a serial way ( successively ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) or in a parallel manner ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the parallel interference cancelation ( pic ) is a low computational complex method that causes less decision delay compared to the successive detection and is much simpler in implementation .    usually at the first stage of interference cancelation in a multiple stage system ,",
    "the interfering data for each user which is made by other users is unknown .",
    "pic is implemented to estimate this data stage by stage .",
    "in fact when mai is estimated for each user , the bit decision at the @xmath0 stage of cancelation are used for bit detection at the @xmath1 stage .",
    "apparently , the more accurate the estimates are , the better performance of the detector is .",
    "however , in the conventional multistage pic @xcite , a wrong decision in one stage can increase the interference .",
    "based on minimizing the mean square error between the received signal and its estimate from the previous stage , g. xue _",
    "proposed the least mean square - partial parallel interference cancelation ( lms - ppic ) method @xcite . in lms - ppic ,",
    "a weighted value of mai of other users is subtracted before making the decision of a specific user .",
    "the least mean square ( lms ) optimization and the normalized least mean square ( nlms ) algorithm @xcite shape the structure of the lms - ppic method of the weight estimation of each cancelation stage .",
    "however , the performance of the nlms algorithm is mostly dependent on its step - size .",
    "although a large step - size results in a faster convergence rate , but it causes a large maladjustment . on the other hand , with a very small step - size , the algorithm almost keeps its initial values and can not estimate the true cancelation weights . in the lms - ppic method ,",
    "both of these cases cause propagation of error from one stage to another . in lms - ppic ,",
    "the @xmath2 element of the weight vector in each stage is the true transmitted binary value of the @xmath2 user divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage .",
    "hence the magnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity .",
    "this is a valuable information that can be used to improve the performance of the lms - ppic method . in this paper",
    ", we propose parallel lms - ppic ( plms - ppic ) method by using a set of nlms algorithms with different step - sizes .",
    "the step - size of each algorithm is chosen from a sharp range @xcite that guarantees stable operation . while in this paper we assume coherent transmission , the non - coherent scenario is investigated in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ s2 ] , the lms - ppic @xcite is reviewed .",
    "the lms - ppic algorithm is an important example of multistage parallel interference cancelation methods . in section [ s3 ] ,",
    "the plms - ppic method is explained . in section [ s5 ]",
    "some simulation examples are given to compare the results of plms - ppic with those of lms - ppic .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section [ s6 ] .",
    "we assume @xmath3 users synchronously send their symbols @xmath4 via a base - band cdma transmission system where @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6 user has its own code @xmath7 of length @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , for all @xmath10 .",
    "it means that for each symbol @xmath8 bits are transmitted by each user and the processing gain is equal to @xmath8 . at the receiver",
    "we assume that perfect power control scheme is applied . without loss of generality",
    ", we also assume that the power gains of all channels are equal to unity and users channels do not change during each symbol transmission ( it can change from one symbol transmission to the next one ) and the channel phase @xmath11 of @xmath6 user is known for all @xmath12 ( see @xcite for non - coherent transmission ) .",
    "we define @xmath13 according to the above assumptions , the received signal is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is additive white gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath16 . in order to make a new variable set @xmath17 for the current stage @xmath18",
    ", multistage parallel interference cancelation method uses @xmath19 ( the bit estimate outputs of the previous stage @xmath20 ) to estimate the related mai of each user , to subtract it from the received signal @xmath21 and to make a new decision on each user variable individually .",
    "the output of the last stage is considered as the final estimate of the transmitted bits . in the following",
    "we explain the structure of the lms - pic method .",
    "assume @xmath22 is a given estimate of @xmath23 from stage @xmath20 .",
    "let us define @xmath24 from ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) we have @xmath25 define    @xmath26^t,\\\\ \\label{e9 } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!x^{s}(n)\\!\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!\\![\\alpha^{(s-1)}_1c_1(n),\\alpha^{(s-1)}_2c_2(n),\\cdots,\\alpha^{(s-1)}_mc_m(n)]^t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 stands for transposition . from equations ( [ e7 ] ) , ( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ e9 ] ) , we have @xmath28 given the observations @xmath29 , an adaptive algorithm can be used to compute @xmath30^t,\\ ] ] which is an estimate of @xmath31 after @xmath8 iterations .",
    "then @xmath32 , the estimate of @xmath23 at stage @xmath18 , is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for complex conjugation and @xmath35 the inputs of the first stage @xmath36 ( needed for computing @xmath37 ) is given by the conventional bit detection @xmath38 given the available information @xmath29 and using equation ( [ e10 ] ) , there are a variety of choices for parameter estimation . in lms - ppic",
    ", the nlms algorithm is used to compute @xmath39 .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows the full structure of the lms - ppic method .    to improve the performance of the lms - ppic method , in the next section we propose a modified version of it . in our method a set of individual nlms algorithms with different step - sizes are used .",
    "the nlms ( with fixed step - size ) converges only in the mean sense . in the literature",
    ", @xmath40 guarantees the mean convergence of the nlms algorithm @xcite .",
    "based on cramr - rao bound , a sharper range was given in @xcite as follows @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the length of the parameter under estimate . here",
    "@xmath3 is the number of users or equivalently the system load .",
    "as equation ( [ tte2 ] ) shows , the range of the step - size is a decreasing function of the system load .",
    "it means that as the number of users increases , the step - size must be decreased and vice versa . in the proposed plms - ppic method , @xmath42 has a critical role .    from ( [ e6 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath43 which is equivalent to @xmath44 to improve the performance of the nlms algorithm , at time iteration @xmath10 , we can determine the step size @xmath45 from @xmath42 , in such a way that @xmath46 is minimized , i.e. @xmath47 where @xmath48 , the @xmath2 element of @xmath49 , is given by ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) @xmath50 the complexity to determine @xmath45 from ( [ e15 ] ) is high , especially for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "instead we propose the following method .",
    "we divide @xmath42 into @xmath51 subintervals and consider @xmath51 individual step - sizes @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . in each stage , @xmath51 individual nlms algorithms are executed ( @xmath55 is the step - size of the @xmath56 algorithm ) . in stage @xmath18 and at iteration @xmath10 , if @xmath57^t$ ] , the parameter estimate of the @xmath58 algorithm minimized our criteria , i.e. @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , then it is considered as the parameter estimate at time iteration @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath62 and all other algorithms replace their weight estimates by @xmath63 .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] shows the details of the plms - ppic method .",
    "as table  [ tab2 ] shows , in stage @xmath18 and at time iteration @xmath8 where @xmath64 is computed , the plms - ppic method computes @xmath32 from equation ( [ e11 ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the lms - ppic method . here",
    "the plms - ppic and the lms - ppic methods are compared with each other .    * computing @xmath65 , @xmath51 times more than lms - ppic , and computing @xmath66 in each iteration of each stage of plms - ppic , is the difference between it and the lms - ppic method .",
    "* because the step - sizes of all individual nlms algorithms of the proposed method are given from a stable operation range , all of them converge fast or slowly .",
    "hence the plms - ppic is a stable method . * as we expected and",
    "our simulations show , choosing the step - size as a decreasing function of system loads ( based on relation ( [ tte2 ] ) ) improves the performance of both nlms algorithm in lms - ppic and parallel nlms algorithms in plms - ppic methods in such a way that there is no need for the third stage , i.e. both the lms - ppic and plms - ppic methods get the optimum weights in the second stage .",
    "however only when the channel is time varying , the third stage is needed , e.g. [ ex4 ] . * increasing the number of parallel nlms algorithms @xmath51 in plms - ppic method increases the complexity , while it improves the performance as well . * as our simulations show , the lms - ppic method is more sensitive to the channel loss , near - far problem or unbalanced channel gain compared to the plms - ppic .    in the following section ,",
    "some examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods .",
    "in this section we have considered some simulation examples .",
    "examples [ ex2]-[ex4 ] compare the conventional , the lms - ppic and the plms - ppic methods in three cases : balanced channels , unbalanced channels and time varying channels .",
    "example [ ex2 ] is given to compare lms - ppic and plms - ppic in the case of balanced channels .",
    "_ balanced channels _ : [ ex2 ] consider the system model ( [ e7 ] ) in which @xmath3 users , each having their own codes of length @xmath8 , send their own bits synchronously to the receiver and through their channels .",
    "the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is @xmath67db . in this example",
    "we assume that there is no power - unbalanced or channel loss .",
    "the step - size of the nlms algorithm in lms - ppic method is @xmath68 and the set of step - sizes of the parallel nlms algorithms in plms - ppic method is @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ figex2 ] shows the average bit error rate ( ber ) over all users versus @xmath3 , using two stages when @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "as it is shown , while there is no remarkable performance difference between all three methods for @xmath71 , the plms - ppic outperforms the conventional and the lms - ppic methods for @xmath72 . simulations also show that there is no remarkable difference between results in two stage and three stage scenarios .    although lms - ppic and plms - ppic are structured based on the assumption of no near - far problem , these methods ( especially the second one ) have remarkable performance in the cases of unbalanced and/or time varying channels .",
    "these facts are shown in the two upcoming examples .    _ unbalanced channels _ : [ ex3 ] consider example [ ex2 ] with power unbalance and/or channel loss in transmission system , i.e. the true model at stage @xmath18 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "both the lms - ppic and the plms - ppic methods assume the model ( [ e7 ] ) , and their estimations are based on observations @xmath76 , instead of @xmath77 , where the channel gain matrix is @xmath78 . in this case",
    "we repeat example [ ex2 ] .",
    "we randomly get each element of @xmath79 from @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "results are given in figure  [ figex3 ] .",
    "as it is shown , in all cases the plms - ppic method outperforms both the conventional and the lms - ppic methods .",
    "[ ex4 ] _ time varying channels _ : consider example [ ex2 ] with time varying rayleigh fading channels . in this case",
    "we assume the maximum doppler shift of @xmath81hz , the three - tap frequency - selective channel with delay vector of @xmath82sec and gain vector of @xmath83db .",
    "results are given in figure  [ figex4 ] .",
    "as it is seen while the plms - ppic outperforms the conventional and the lms - ppic methods when the number of users is less than @xmath84 , all three methods have the same performance when the number of users is greater than @xmath84 .",
    "in this paper , parallel interference cancelation using adaptive multistage structure and employing a set of nlms algorithms with different step - sizes is proposed . according to the proposed method , in each iteration",
    "the parameter estimate is chosen in a way that its corresponding algorithm has the best compatibility with the true parameter . because the step - sizes of all algorithms are chosen from a stable range , the total system is therefore stable .",
    "simulation results show that the new method has a remarkable performance for different scenarios including rayleigh fading channels even if the channel is unbalanced .",
