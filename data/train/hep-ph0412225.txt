    "along with the theoretical and experimental progresses , b physics is attracting more and more attentions . the non - perturbative light - cone ( lc ) wavefunction / distribtuion amplitude ( da ) of the b meson plays an important role in making reliable predictions for exclusive b meson decays .",
    "the b meson da has been investigated in various approaches@xcite and is the basis of the collinear factorization@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite shows that the b meson da is not normalizable .",
    "such feature of the b meson da does not cause a problem in practice@xcite , but it does introduce an ambiguity in defining the b meson decay constant @xmath5 . recently , ref.@xcite claims that it is the b meson wavefunction that is more relevant to the b decays and in the framework of the @xmath6-factorization theorem@xcite , they proved that the b meson wavefunction is renormalizable after taking into account renormalization - group evolution effects . in the @xmath6-factorization theorem , by taking into account the transverse momentum dependence ( @xmath6-dependence ) into the non - perturbative wavefunctions and the hard scattering , the endpoint singularity ( an example can be found in ref.@xcite ) coming from the collinear factorization can be cured .",
    "theoretically , it is an important issue to study the longitudinal and transverse momentum dependence of the b wavefunction , since it provides a major source of uncertainty in the calculations of the b decays .",
    "ref.@xcite presents an analytic solution for the b - meson wavefunction , which satisfies the constraints coming from the equations of motion and the heavy - quark symmetry@xcite .",
    "they find that the `` wandzura - wilczek - type '' contribution@xcite ( ww approximation ) , which corresponds to the valence quark distribution , can be determined uniquely in analytic form in terms of the `` effective mass '' ( @xmath7 ) of the meson state , which is defined in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet)@xcite .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite , two extra constraints for the b - meson wavefunction come from the heavy quark limit , @xmath1 .",
    "since the mass of b - quark is limited , such condition might be too strong , and we will not take such limit in our present calculation . in the following , we shall solve the two equations that are derived from the equation of motion of the light spectator quark on the basis of some physical considerations .",
    "in hqet@xcite , the wavefunctions @xmath8 of the b meson can be defined in terms of the vacuum - to - meson matrix element of the nonlocal operators : @xmath9.\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the 4-momentum of the b meson with mass @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the effective @xmath17-quark field .",
    "@xmath18 is a generic dirac matrix .",
    "the path - ordered gauge factors are implied in between the constituent fields .",
    "note that in the above definition , the separation between the quark and the antiquark is not restricted on the lc ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the effective mass @xmath20 is much smaller than the b meson mass , so the light spectator quark in the b meson can be treated as on mass shell with high precision .",
    "based on the qcd equation of motion for the light spectator quark , we can obtain a set of equations for @xmath21 under the ww approximation , i.e. @xmath22= 0\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath23 when taking the lc limit @xmath24 , the above two equations agree well with the ones in refs.@xcite . by doing the fourier transformation , @xmath25 , eqs.([original1],[original2 ] )",
    "become that @xmath26 and @xmath27 + 4\\frac{\\partial^{3}\\psi_{+}(\\omega , z^2)}{\\partial \\omega^{2}\\partial z^2 } = 0\\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 has the meaning of the lc projection @xmath29 of the light - antiquark momentum in the b meson",
    ". the exact solution of eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) will give strong constraints on the longitudinal and transverse momentum dependence of the b wavefunction under the ww approximation .",
    "at present , one can not obtain the exact solution for the b - meson wavefunctions @xmath30 only with eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) . some prescriptions must be made . under the prescription that @xmath30 have the same @xmath31-dependence and by taking the heavy quark limit @xmath1 , ref.@xcite obtained an analytic solution for @xmath30 . in the present paper",
    ", we do not take such limit and try to solve eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) by taking two other prescriptions .    before solving eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) , we define two functions @xmath32 in the following way , @xmath33 where the second line shows that @xmath32 are precisely the b meson das . taking the lc limit ( @xmath24 ) in eq.([eq:1 ] ) , one can directly obtain a relation between the two das @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the b meson , @xmath36 which agrees with the one obtained in refs.@xcite .    furthermore , one can prove that if the b - meson wavefunctions @xmath30 can be constructed in the following way , @xmath37 then @xmath38 must be a function of the correlated variable @xmath39 $ ] has nothing to do with the variable @xmath40 has been discussed in ref.@xcite and will not be discussed here . ] , where @xmath41 is the maximum value of @xmath40 .",
    "the ansatz ( [ generalwf ] ) shows that the two wavefunctions @xmath30 have the same @xmath31-dependence @xmath38 . a boundary condition for @xmath38 can be derived from eqs.([definephi],[generalwf ] ) ,",
    "i.e. @xmath42 . from the above ansatz , we can solve eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) exactly without taking the heavy quark limit @xmath1 .    substituting eq.([generalwf ] ) into eq.([eq:1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the function of a single variable @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath46 can be derived from eqs.([eq:2],[chixi ] ) , which reads @xmath47 where the parameter @xmath48 is to be determined . with the help of the above results , eq.([eq:2 ] ) changes to @xmath49}{dy }",
    "+ [ a_1\\sigma(y)+(1+a_1)\\xi(y)]=0,\\ ] ] with @xmath50 .",
    "eq.([simeq2 ] ) should be satisfied for all values of @xmath40 , and then we have to set , @xmath51 the non - trivial solution of the above equation is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the zero-_th _ normal bessel function . here",
    "@xmath54 must be less than zero , because if @xmath55 , then it will lead to @xmath56 ; and if @xmath57 , then one may obtain a self - contradictory result from eq.([finaleq ] ) : @xmath58 .",
    "after doing the fourier transformation for the transverse part , @xmath59 , the final solution for the b - meson wavefunctions can be written as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the maximum value of @xmath40 and the normalized das take the form , @xmath62 the @xmath63 function guarantees that the maximum value of @xmath40 is @xmath41",
    ". one may find that if taking @xmath64 , the above solution for the b - meson wavefunction agrees with the result in ref.@xcite .",
    "eq.([solution3 ] ) shows that the dependence on transverse and longitudinal momenta is strongly correlated through the combination @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "similar transverse momentum behavior has been discussed in ref.@xcite and has been obtained by using the dispersion relations and the quark - hadron duality@xcite , where they stated that the @xmath6 dependence of the wavefunction depends on the off - shell energy of the valence quarks , i.e. @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the momentum fraction carried by the valence quarks . under such kind of @xmath6-dependence , by doing the fourier transformation , we find that the correlation between @xmath40 and @xmath31 for the transverse part combines in a way like @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "thus the above results has been proved completely and eqs.([eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) impose a strong constraint , i.e. @xmath68 $ ] , on the b - meson wavefunction .",
    "however , one may ask a question whether the ansatz ( [ generalwf ] ) is too strong . in order to study the b - meson wavefunction more deeply",

    ", we obtain @xmath88 eq.([bessel0eq ] ) can be changed into a zero-_th _ normal bessel function by doing the variable transformation , @xmath89 @xmath90 , and then we get @xmath91 .    with the help of the above results",
    ", we finally obtain the solution for the b - meson wavefunctions under the ansatz eq.([bhleq ] ) , i.e. @xmath92 where the normalization condition , @xmath93 , has been adopted .",
    "we have solved the equations which are derived from the equation of motion of the light spectator quark by using two different ansatz , i.e. eq.([generalwf ] ) and eq.([bhleq ] ) . under the condition @xmath0 , the results ( see eqs.([solution3],[solution2 ] ) and eqs.([phiplus],[phiminus ] ) ) for these two different ansatz agree with the one obtained directly by taking the heavy quark limit @xmath94@xcite , i.e. these three prescriptions are equivalent .",

    "both @xmath115 and @xmath116 satisfy the relation eq.([relationap ] ) .",

    ".    one may observe from figs.([phinb],[phigs ] ) that the value of @xmath123 is always bigger than @xmath124 and the value of @xmath124 is negative in small @xmath40 regions , such behavior might lead to the total net contribution from @xmath124 be much smaller than that of @xmath123 . in literature , many authors ( see refs.@xcite ) did the phenomenological analysis with a single distribution amplitude @xmath125 , setting @xmath126 ( or strictly speaking , ignoring the contributions from @xmath127 ) .",
    "however , since @xmath128 and @xmath129 have a quite different endpoint behavior , such difference maybe strongly enhanced by the hard scattering kernel .",
    "the results in refs.@xcite for @xmath130 transition form factor confirm this observation .",
    "especially in ref.@xcite , by comparing the pqcd results in the large recoil regions with those obtained from the qcd light - cone sum rules and the extrapolated lattice qcd , the authors give a detailed analysis on the consistent calculation of the @xmath130 transition form factor in the whole physical region .",

    "in fact , a discussion on using a single @xmath125 is given in ref.@xcite , which is based on the assumption that @xmath131 vanishes at the both ends of the momentum @xmath40 .",
    "there is therefore no convincing motivation for setting @xmath126 and such an approximation may lead to unreliable results . since for the endpoint region , the contribution from the hard scattering part might be big , which is the case of @xmath130 and @xmath132@xcite transition form factors , so we argue that both @xmath125 and @xmath127 should be kept for a better understanding of the b physics .",

    "our analysis shows that the equation of motion of the light spectator quark can impose a strong constraint on the b - meson wavefunctions @xmath2 .",
