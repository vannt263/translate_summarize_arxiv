    "in nowadays it is well accepted that in the helm of quantum reality probability amplitudes rule the existence of the particles of light or of matter .",
    "the most fundamental distinction between classical and quantum phenomena are the interference of probability amplitudes that do not exist in the former . by following the trajectories of quantum particles inside a periodic lattice and preserving their classical probabilities for reflection",

    "diffraction in crystals are reproducible after assigning , according to some previously established criteria , probability amplitudes to every classical outcome .",
    "when applied to x - ray diffraction in reflection geometry , this procedure has provided simple recursive equations to calculated the x - ray reflectivity of crystals with thickness varying since a few atomic layers to infinity .",
    "the results are in perfect agreement with the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction , even when absorption is considered .",
