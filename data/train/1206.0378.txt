    "we mention two such concepts which will later be studied in this paper .",
    "the first is the _ observability map _",
    "@xmath23 which is a linear map from @xmath18 into the @xmath16-valued functions on @xmath2 .",
    "( in this paper we use the convention that for any variables @xmath24 and a word @xmath25 we have @xmath26 , @xmath27 , if @xmath28 we interpret it as an identity . ) by studying the observability map we can find out what we are able to know about the internal space @xmath18 by observing the output .",
    "the second concept we want to mention here is the _ transfer function _ which is a description of how inputs are transferred into outputs . in the multi - variable context above the transfer function",
    "can be defined as a formal power series @xmath29 where @xmath30 with indeterminates @xmath31 freely noncommuting among each other but commuting with the linear maps , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 denoting a transpose of the row vectors so @xmath34 and @xmath35 are column vectors of linear maps . in the classical case",
    "@xmath14 we call the single variable @xmath36 and then this reduces to a familiar formula which gives the transfer function as an analytic function . explicitly @xmath37",
    "we come back to this at the end of section [ section : structure ] .",
    "see also @xcite for further discussions of similar formulas .",
    "mathematical system theory is an abstraction from the physical dynamics .",
    "but of course its relevance to the real world depends on the fact that such a physical dynamics exists in the background . the basic idea behind our work is the proposal that the physical dynamics which implements a multi - variable system theory ( such as the one sketched above ) is described by processes describing quantum physics . in @xcite we started a project to investigate such connections , compare further @xcite for a recent generalization of the model in @xcite and also @xcite for some complementary work . in these papers",
    "the quantum processes are based on infinite tensor products which are natural from the point of view of approximating the fock spaces of continuous time processes but which sometimes obscure the more fundamental level where the connections with operator and system theory originate . in the present paper",
    "we go directly to this level by investigating the proposal that it is the concept of ` weak markov processes ' , worked out by bhat and parthasarathy in @xcite to catch the most basic features of quantum markov processes , which provides a systematic and very general point of departure for our project .",
    "the connections to operator theory are evident here because the concept of a weak markov process may be seen as operator theoretic dilation theory studied from a probabilistic point of view .",
    "dilation theory will be mentioned only in side remarks in this paper however , the emphasis lies on the structure of the full process .",
    "the benefits of such studies go in both directions : access to operator and system theory tools for concrete quantum models and guidance for the development of the general theory from the questions arising in the models .",
    "to achieve such an interaction between the disciplines a more systematic development of the theory is needed .",
    "the following sketch of the contents of this paper should be read with this motivation in mind .    in section [ section : weak ] we start with a self - contained but concise description of the basic theory of weak markov processes in discrete time : the dynamics is described by a row isometry and then from a co - invariant subspace certain structures emerge which can be given a quantum probabilistic interpretation , such as transition operators and weak filtrations .",
    "most of this is well known but note how in the end we give an operational meaning to the elements of the free semigroup @xmath2 by interpreting them as certain measurement protocols .    in section [ section : structure ]",
    "we define the notion of a representation of structure maps @xmath38 ( as described above ) by a weak markov process and in this way we get an explicit systematic procedure to identify multi - variable linear systems ( as described above ) within quantum physical models . at this point",
    "it remains quite abstract . as a preparation for seeing representations of structure maps in use",
    "we first introduce in section [ section : cat ] the theory of subprocesses and quotient processes of ( discrete weak markov ) processes and then show that within a suitably defined category of processes this can be reformulated as a short exact sequence .",
    "the main result here is a classification of extensions appearing in such short exact sequences by a construction which we call a @xmath39-cascade of processes .",
    "there is a set of contractions from which @xmath39 can be chosen which gives a parametrization of all the ways in which two processes can be put together as subprocess and quotient process , with @xmath40 yielding the direct sum .",
    "cascades are a well known concept for systems and their structure maps .",
    "the terminology of a @xmath39-cascade for processes is justified in section [ section : cascades ] where we show that within a @xmath39-cascade of processes we have a representation of a cascade of the original systems and that in fact this construction is a natural tool to represent cascades of systems and of structure maps .",
    "let us remark here that the notion of cascades and of more general networks of processes has been around for some time in a continuous time setting and this theory has been investigated intensely because of promising applications in quantum filtering and quantum control @xcite .",
    "there is no explicit comparison with continuous time systems in this paper , however we provide the basis for such a comparison by describing weak markov processes in terms of product systems which suggests how to build the theory starting from continuous product systems .",
    "our justification for concentrating on the discrete time setting here is the same as in helton s seminal paper @xcite in which he connects classical system theory ( @xmath14 ) with operator models and scattering theory , saying : ` we concentrate on discrete time systems because it is for these that the relationship is most clear ' ( @xcite , p.15 ) .",
    "in fact , very similarly to the path followed by helton in @xcite it is quite natural in our setting to connect observability of represented multi - variable linear systems with scattering in quantum physical models .",
    "we investigate observability in section [ section : observable ] and show that in a quantum model it can be given the same interpretation as in classical system theory , namely that by observing the outputs we have an indirect way to measure and to investigate those parts of the internal space which have the character of a black box .",
    "we show that we get a particularly interesting situation if we have a @xmath39-cascade and if we use the input space of the subprocess as the output space of the cascade , so that looking for observability amounts to the question how much we can find out about the cascade by observations which only involve the subprocess .",
    "the extreme case when we can find out everything about the cascade by such special observations we call asymptotically complete .",
    "we give a convenient criterion for asymptotic completeness in terms of asymptotic properties of the transition operator of the process which is a completely positive map .",
    "this criterion is a generalization of a criterion for asymptotic completeness @xcite in a scattering theory for operator algebraic stationary quantum markov processes introduced by kmmerer and maassen in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that our definition of asymptotic completeness for short exact sequences of weak processes can be seen as a generalization of the definition of kmmerer and maassen .",
    "such a connection has been hinted at in @xcite but the theory developed in this paper allows us to explain the relevant facts in a much more conceptual and elegant way .",
    "the details are in section [ section : scattering ] .",
    "we include the general fact that normal invariant states lead to weak subprocesses and we work out how for a stationary markov chain in an operator algebraic setting we can construct an associated weak process together with a subprocess ( with one - dimensional internal space ) and hence we can establish the connection to our previous results .",
    "this improved conceptual understanding of asymptotic completeness is an excellent example of the cross - fertilization between operator and system theory on the one hand and quantum probability on the other hand which we have in mind .",
    "it uses only a very special case of our general theory and suggests further work .",
    "unitary dynamics on a hilbert space is the most basic way of describing quantum mechanical evolution .",
    "if causality is taken into account and one restricts the attention to observables belonging only to the future ( or only to the past ) then it becomes natural to study @xmath41-endomorphisms of @xmath42 , the algebra of bounded linear operators on a hilbert space @xmath43 . a convincing argument in this direction",
    "is presented in @xcite , section 1.2 . from now on let @xmath44 be a @xmath41-endomorphism and @xmath43 a separable hilbert space .",
    "then it follows from the representation theory of @xmath42 that there exists a separable hilbert space @xmath45 and an isometry @xmath46 such that for all @xmath47 @xmath48 we assume @xmath49 , then @xmath50 is automatically injective .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "if @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 or @xmath6 ) is an orthonormal basis of @xmath45 then with @xmath53 we can also write @xmath54 ( limits to be understood in the strong operator topology if @xmath6 ) which is called a _ kraus decomposition_. the @xmath55 are isometries with orthogonal ranges , so alternatively ( and with the same notation ) we also think of @xmath56 as a _ row isometry _ @xmath57 @xmath56 is called a _ row unitary _ if @xmath58 and this is equivalent to @xmath50 being unital , i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "if this additional assumption is used in the following then it will always be explicitly stated .",
    "+   + using induction we define row isometries @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 ) by @xmath62 and , for @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath65 later we need the following equivalent description for the adjoints : if @xmath66 and @xmath67 then @xmath68 it is not difficult to check that this implements the @xmath69-th power of @xmath50 : @xmath70 here the notation is @xmath71 if @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the length of the word .",
    "this kraus decomposition where a sum over all words of length @xmath69 occurs gives the first connection to the multi - variable formalism sketched in section [ section : intro ] .",
    "+ remark : the tensor products @xmath74 appearing in these formulas represent the ( discrete ) product system associated to the endomorphism @xmath50 and though we do not go into continuous time systems in this paper it is worth noting that the natural starting point to translate our results to continuous time would be to consider continuous product systems and in this way make the connection with the theory exposed in @xcite .    to introduce processes which resemble markov processes from probability theory we need to specify a subspace @xmath75 ( by which we always mean a closed subspace if not otherwise stated ) .",
    "let us denote the orthogonal projection onto @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "( in this paper we use consistently the notation @xmath78 for the orthogonal projection onto a subspace @xmath79 . )",

    "the importance of co - invariant subspaces in this context has been observed by many , see for example @xcite for various related topics .",

    "this means that for a row unitary we can always use the simpler statements ( 1)-(4 ) when dealing with co - invariant subspaces .",

    "then @xmath105 is the orthogonal projection onto @xmath106 .",

    "but it is the identity @xmath512 presented with a change of basis that describes the relative position of the weak filtrations of the process @xmath537 and of the process @xmath538 .",
    "second , from the point of view of dilation theory , in the case of asymptotic completeness we deal with socalled subisometric dilations .",
    "we do nt go into this here , see @xcite for details .",
    "third , asymptotic completeness and its observability aspect can also be given an explicit quantum physical interpretation by reconsidering the observables discussed in proposition [ prop : operational ] .",
    "indeed , in the case of asymptotic completeness the hilbert space @xmath43 is the closed span of the spaces @xmath539 ( with @xmath80 , the case @xmath185 to be interpreted as @xmath288 ) .",
    "it follows that the algebras @xmath540 generate @xmath42 ( as a von neumann algebra ) .",
    "on the other hand , the observables @xmath541 if we consider all @xmath542 and all @xmath543 , generate @xmath544 ( as a von neumann algebra ) .",
    "conclusion : we can approximate arbitrary observables in @xmath42 in the weak ( or strong ) operator topology by observables generated by these @xmath188 and @xmath545 .",
    "in particular , in physics language , we can answer all questions about observables on the part @xmath299 ( and hence also find the state ) from measuring observables on the orthogonal part @xmath288 of the internal space ( the @xmath188 ) together with field observables ( the @xmath545 ) .",
    "we have the following quantitative statement about these approximations which stresses the role of the observability operator @xmath264 : if @xmath546 then the norm distance squared of @xmath547 from the space @xmath548 is given by @xmath549 .",
    "if we have asymptotic completeness then @xmath536 is isometric and this distance tends to @xmath7 for @xmath550 .",
    "the following way of finding subprocesses gives a connection to a topic which is of natural interest for quantum markov processes and more general for quantum probability : invariant states .",
    "recall that if @xmath551 is a normal state of a von neumann algebra then in this von neumann algebra there exists a smallest orthogonal projection @xmath552 such that @xmath553 , called the support projection @xmath554 .",
    "for all elements @xmath555 we have @xmath556 essentially the following is lemma 6.1 from @xcite , for convenience we include a proof which uses our now familiar terminology and notation .",
    "[ prop : state ] given a process @xmath116 , suppose that @xmath551 is a normal state of @xmath115 which is invariant for the transition operator @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath557 then with @xmath558 the subspace @xmath288 is co - invariant for @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath559 .",
    "then @xmath560 hence @xmath561 ( because @xmath551 restricted to the subalgebra @xmath562 , obtained by compression with its support , is a faithful state ) . but @xmath563 with @xmath564 .",
    "hence @xmath565 which shows that @xmath288 is co - invariant for @xmath56 .",
    "using proposition [ prop : state ] we can always find a subprocess from a normal invariant state and this subprocess is nontrivial , in the sense that @xmath529 , if and only if the state is not faithful .",
    "definition [ def : ac ] for asymptotic completeness applies and we can use the criteria in theorem [ thm : observable ] . instead of further analyzing the general case we concentrate for the rest of this section on an application to a class of noncommutative markov processes which are not originally weak markov processes but which nevertheless can be studied successfully by our methods .",
    "the following construction represents the most basic way of introducing stationary markov chains in an operator algebraic context . in this form",
    "it is taken from @xcite , see more details there .",
    "a more leisurely introduction to the topic is @xcite .",
    "let @xmath566 and @xmath567 be @xmath114-algebras and let @xmath568 be a non - zero @xmath41-homomorphism .",

    ". then the stationarity condition translates into the fact that @xmath579 ( with @xmath580 ) is an isometry . in chapter 1 of @xcite @xmath581",
    "is called the _ associated isometry _ and it plays a central role there in the analysis of the markov chain .",
    "we are now in a position to deepen this analysis and to make the conceptual framework more elegant by putting it into the context provided in this paper .",
    "we start with the adjoint @xmath582 which is a ( row ) coisometry .",
    "hence its minimal isometric dilation @xmath583 is a row unitary and @xmath116 is a unital process .",
    "( it is a well known fact in dilation theory which can be checked directly that the minimal isometric dilation @xmath56 on @xmath43 of a row contraction on @xmath76 is a row unitary if and only if the row contraction is coisometric . )",
    "we call @xmath116 the ( weak ) process associated to the original stationary markov chain",
    ". + remark : if we think of @xmath110 as a kind of ( schrdinger ) dynamics of vector states for a weak process then we see that for an associated weak process this is provided on @xmath76 by the associated isometry @xmath581",
    ". note however that if we consider the original noncommutative random variables @xmath584 as steps of a ( heisenberg ) dynamics of observables then there is a time reversal involved if we go to the noncommutative random variables @xmath84 ( as in section [ section : weak ] ) as steps of a ( heisenberg ) dynamics of observables for the associated weak process . +",
    "but there is more structure available from a stationary markov chain .",
    "one can check that the vector state represented by @xmath585 is invariant for the transition operator @xmath91 of the ( weak ) process and hence we can invoke proposition [ prop : state ] to see that its support , the one - dimensional subspace @xmath586 , is co - invariant for @xmath56 .",
    "in fact it is easy to check this directly : consider the one - dimensional subspace @xmath587 . because @xmath588 and @xmath589 we find @xmath590 which implies that @xmath288 is co - invariant for @xmath56 and hence we have a subprocess @xmath287 .",
    "combined with the analysis in section [ section : cat ] we obtain the surprising result that the gns - hilbert space of a stationary markov chain always carries automatically the structure of a @xmath39-cascade @xmath591 and we can think of the whole short exact sequence @xmath382 as being _ associated _ to the stationary markov chain .",
    "we have @xmath586 and @xmath592 .",
    "let us investigate what asymptotic completeness means in this case .",
    "we can define the associated isometry @xmath593 for the @xmath69-th noncommutative random variable @xmath584 which , because it arises from the same iterative procedure , can be expressed by the iteration @xmath594 of @xmath56 . with @xmath580 and @xmath595 we have @xmath596 and from that @xmath597 which yields the norm equality @xmath598 because @xmath599 increases to the projection @xmath525 ( which is the limit for @xmath550 in the strong operator topology ) it follows that the property @xmath500 , equivalent to asymptotic completeness by theorem [ thm : observable ] , is also equivalent to @xmath600 for all @xmath251 .",
    "if the gns - representation is faithful then we can interpret the hilbert space norm as a norm @xmath601 on the @xmath114-algebra and we can write @xmath602 for all @xmath580 , where @xmath603 denotes the conditional expectation obtained by evaluating the state @xmath551 on @xmath566",
    ".    however the latter condition is well known to be equivalent to the asymptotic completeness of the stationary markov chain in a scattering theory meaning introduced by kmmerer and maassen in @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier here we followed a variant developed in @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of the convergence in the norm @xmath604 above with the property of asymptotic completeness in the scattering theory meaning is stated in lemma 1.5 of @xcite .",
    "hence , proceeding as above , all these meanings of asymptotic completeness coincide .",
    "let us summarize this insight as follows :    [ prop : complete ] the short exact sequence of weak processes associated to a stationary markov chain is asymptotically complete in the sense of definition [ def : ac ] if and only if the stationary markov chain is asymptotically complete in the scattering theory meaning of @xcite or @xcite",
    ". a necessary and sufficient criterion is given by @xmath605    in fact , the last statement is nothing but criterion ( 5 ) for asymptotic completeness from theorem [ thm : observable ] applied to this special situation .",
    "this reproduces a criterion for asymptotic completeness in terms of the completely positive map @xmath91 ( which in @xcite is called the dual extended transition operator @xmath606 , see @xcite , section 4 , in particular theorem 4.3 ) .",
    "because in this case @xmath586 is one - dimensional the criterion is also equivalent to the ergodicity of @xmath91 , i.e. the fixed point set of @xmath91 being equal to @xmath607 , see @xcite , section 3 , for more details .    the construction of the scattering theory itself with its intertwiners ( mller operators ) between a free and a perturbed dynamics requires a two - sided process ( i.e. with time variable in @xmath608 for discrete time ) as in @xcite or the construction of a two - sided extension as in @xcite and it would take us too far to include it here .",
    "the reader who follows the given sources will recognize that the change of basis studied in section [ section : observable ] relating the weak filtration of @xmath609 to the weak filtration of @xmath538 and given by the identity on the one - dimensional @xmath586 plus the observability map from @xmath299 to @xmath241 plus the multi - analytic operator associated to the transfer function ( on @xmath239 ) , is a gns - version of the mller operator in the scattering theory , in the same way as the associated weak markov process is a gns - version of the stationary markov chain .",
    "if we take into account the identification of @xmath322 with the inductive limit of the sequence @xmath610 mentioned in section [ section : weak ] and note that because @xmath586 is one - dimensional we can identify it further with an infinite tensor product @xmath611 then we arrive essentially at the version of the scattering theory worked out in @xcite , chapter 2 .",
    "but the setting of this paper is more general . for example we could also consider stationary markov chains which are not originally constructed by tensor products of algebras and nevertheless associate weak processes via gns - construction and apply proposition [ prop : state ] to find subprocesses ( with @xmath586 ) . or we can study higher - dimensional co - invariant subspaces @xmath288",
