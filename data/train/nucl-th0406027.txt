    "<S> @xmath91 due to the relativistic reduction .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculations of the four - quark condensates require model assumptions on the structure of the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the complete set of the four - quark condensates was obtained in @xcite by using the perturbative chiral quark model ( pcqm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral quark model , originally suggested in @xcite , was developed further in @xcite@xcite . in the pcqm </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon is treated as a system of relativistic valence quarks moving in an effective static field . </S>",

    "<S> we shall use the qcd sum rules for the calculation of the nucleon characteristics @xmath95 identified with the vector self - energy , dirac effective mass and the effective scalar self - energy  see , e.g. , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two other parameters , to be determined in the approach are the in - medium shifts of the effective values of the nucleon residue @xmath96 and of the continuum threshold @xmath97 . </S>",

    "<S> the characteristics obtain different values for the proton and neutron . considering the asymmetry parameter in the interval @xmath100 </S>",
    "<S> , one can see that the values of any parameter @xmath101 for the proton @xmath102 and neutron @xmath103 are connected as @xmath104 we shall present all the values for the proton , using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 25 ] ) to obtain those for the neutron .    </S>",
    "<S> we carry out the calculations in the gas approximation , including only terms linear in @xmath66 in the lhs of the sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can neglect the fermi motion of the nucleons of the matter , which manifest themselves in higher order of density , and put @xmath105 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath107 is linear in density . </S>",
    "<S> if one neglects the fermi motion of the nucleon , as we did , the same is true for the scalar self - energy @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath109 ( [ 23 ] ) exhibit nonlinear behavior due to nonzero value of @xmath110 ( @xmath111 in the mean field approximation ) . in similar way , the characteristics @xmath0 and @xmath109 are not linear in @xmath66 and @xmath99 in our approach due to the relativity large lhs of the sum rules for the structure @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects distribution of the baryon charge between the pole and continuum . </S>",
    "<S> another reason of the nonlinear effects ( although , numerically less important ) is the nonlinear structure of the sum rules equations .    </S>",
    "<S> the in - medium nucleon qcd sum rules present nucleon interactions with matter in terms of the exchange by uncorrelated quark - antiquark pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the latter exchanges correspond to the meson exchanges with the same quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> thus the contributions of the lowest order ope terms can be viewed to the exchange by the isoscalar and isovector vector and scalar mesons , with the point - like vertices of the interactions , having the standard lorentz structure . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the nonlocal effects in the quark condensates corresponds to inclusion of nonlocal effects in the vertices of the interactions between the nucleons of the matter and the mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the four - quark condensates , in which two of the quark operators are averaged over the vacuum state correspond to the anomalous lorentz structures of the vertices of the nucleon - meson interactions . in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom the four - quarks condensates , </S>",
    "<S> in which all the quark operators act inside the nucleons correspond to the exchanges by the strongly correlated four - quark systems . </S>",
    "<S> such exchanges can be viewed , e.g. , as those by two mesons , interacting with the nucleon at the same point . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by figs .  1 and 2 .    </S>",
