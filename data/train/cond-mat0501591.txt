    "chemically structured substrates have gained significant importance within the last years .",
    "since it is possible to produce networks of chemical lanes at the @xmath0-scale and even below these chemically structured substrates have applications in micro - reactors , for the `` lab on a chip '' , and in chemical sensors @xcite .",
    "they can operate with small amounts of reactants which is important when investigating expensive substances and substances which are available only in small amounts like biological material or when dealing with toxic or explosive materials . at these small scales",
    "the interaction of the fluids with the substrate becomes important and there is the challenge to control the distribution and the flow of the fluids on these structures .    in the following we investigate three different types of chemically structured substrates , as shown in fig.[fig : geometry ] .",
    "first we analyze fluid structures at a chemical step ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](a ) ) which is important for understanding the local properties of fluids at the border of stripes .",
    "next we consider a single chemical stripe ( see fig.[fig : geometry](b ) ) as the simplest chemical surface pattern , and finally we study a periodic stripe pattern ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](c ) ) as the paradigmatic case for the investigation of adsorption at heterogeneous surfaces .",
    "the chemical contrast on the substrates acts on the adjacent liquid @xcite . in order to impress the chemical pattern of the substrate on a one - component liquid",
    ", the chemical structure has to be chosen as a pattern of lyophobic and lyophilic regions . for binary liquid mixtures",
    "one chooses a pattern of two different substrate types , such that one component is preferred by one substrate type and the second component by the other substrate type .",
    "this lateral structuring of the substrate causes a rich fluid - substrate interface structure which typically depends on the molecular details of the local force fields .",
    "however , in this study we focus on the particular case of the fluid being close to a second - order phase transition .",
    "this is either the liquid - vapor critical point of a one - component liquid or the critical demixing transition of a binary liquid mixture . in these cases the ensuing critical phenomena are to a large extent universal in character , i.e.",
    ", they render molecular details irrelevant in favor of universal scaling functions by involving spatial variations on the scale of the diverging correlation length . near the critical point",
    "the surface patterning acts like a laterally varying surface field of alternating sign .",
    "this generates an order parameter profile characterizing critical adsorption of opposite sign such that the system is frustrated across the chemical steps . upon approaching the bulk of the fluid this frustration",
    "is healed and the healing is expected to be governed by universal scaling functions .",
    "in addition , the substrate patterning results in a change of the excess amount of adsorbed fluid with respect to the case of critical adsorption on a homogeneous substrate .",
    "the excess adsorption is expected to be governed by universal scaling functions , too .",
    "it is the purpose of this contribution to describe this scaling in terms of general renormalization group arguments and to calculate the corresponding universal scaling functions to lowest order , i.e. , within mean field theory .",
    "if , as it is actually the case , the size of the lateral structures is comparable with the range of the correlation length , which can reach up to @xmath1 close to the critical point , one can expect a rich interplay between the externally imprinted patterns and the critical phenomena characterized by the correlation length .      in order to describe critical phenomena",
    "@xcite one distinguishes properties to classify them .",
    "starting with unconfined systems one introduces the so - called bulk universality classes which are characterized by critical exponents and amplitudes which describe the dependence of various quantities , e.g. , the order parameter and the correlation length , on the reduced temperature @xmath2 upon approaching the critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "these critical exponents are universal , i.e. , the same for all members of a universality class .",
    "the amplitudes usually are non - universal , whereas the number of independent non - universal amplitudes is limited ; any non - universal amplitude can be expressed in terms of these independent non - universal amplitudes and universal amplitude ratios .",
    "one - component fluids near their liquid - vapor critical point and binary liquids near their demixing critical point belong to the ising universality class like uniaxial ferromagnets .",
    "these systems have two independent non - universal amplitudes . in this sense",
    "our subsequent analysis holds for all systems encompassed by the ising universality class .",
    "the order parameter @xmath4 indicates the degree of order in the system and has to vanish above the critical temperature in the absence of an ordering field while below the critical temperature it takes a finite value .",
    "it is described by the universal critical exponent @xmath5 and a non - universal amplitude @xmath6 : @xmath7 . for a one - component fluid @xmath4",
    "is the difference between the density and its value at the critical point . in the case of a binary liquid mixture",
    "it is chosen as the difference between the concentration of one fluid component and its concentration at the critical demixing point .",
    "the correlation length is defined by the exponential decay of the bulk two - point correlation function @xmath8 for large distances @xmath9 ) at temperatures off criticality ( @xmath10 ) and it is denoted as @xmath11 above and as @xmath12 below the critical temperature , respectively .",
    "it diverges according to the power law @xmath13 with the universal critical exponent @xmath14 and the non - universal amplitudes @xmath15 .",
    "their ratio @xmath16 is , however , universal .",
    "if the critical medium is brought near a substrate , surface universality classes come into play which we shall discuss in sec.[sec : hom - sub ] .",
    "different techniques to produce chemical structures in the range of @xmath0 and @xmath17 have been established @xcite . in order to obtain topologically flat but chemically structured substrates",
    "one can take advantage of the self - ordering mechanism of self - assembled monolayers ( sam ) in using block - copolymers or mixtures of polymers which form structures while demixing @xcite .",
    "the morphology and domain size of these structures depend on different characteristics of the materials and of the formation process .",
    "another possibility to produce structured substrates is to change the functionality of the sams partially by irradiating a homogeneous sam which is covered with a mask that carries the desired structure @xcite .",
    "a third method is the so - called micro - contact printing @xcite where samples , e.g. , produced with lithography , are used as a mold for an elastomer stamp .",
    "the structure of the original is copied by stamping a `` thiol ink '' on gold covered substrates which chemisorbs there and forms a sam .",
    "the empty spaces between the patterns of the stamped structure can be filled with a second thiol with a different functional end - group such that a topologically flat but chemically structured substrate is built up . as a last method we mention the exposure of oxidated titanium surfaces to uv - light @xcite .",
    "+ in order to investigate the structural properties of fluid systems near surfaces various experimental methods have been developed : ellipsometry and especially phase modulated ellipsometry have been established in refs . @xcite and @xcite more than 20 years ago and are still powerful tools @xcite .",
    "an incident light beam is reflected by the surface of interest and the ratio of the complex reflection amplitudes for polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence ( `` coefficient of ellipsometry '' or `` ellipticity '' ) is measured .",
    "the order parameter is modeled and related to the ellipticity via the spatially varying dielectric constant and can then be compared with the measured value . in neutron or x - ray reflectometry one",
    "measures the reflectivity as a function of the momentum transfer normal to the surface of the sample .",
    "this reflectivity spectrum is related to the refractive index profile which itself is associated with the profile of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "a more direct measurement of the adsorption of a component to a substrate can be carried out with a differential refractometer @xcite . here",
    "a laser beam passes a measurement cell consisting of two compartments filled with the fluid of interest and a reference liquid , respectively .",
    "the intensity of the deflected beam is proportional to their difference in refractive index . by comparing this measured intensity with the one of a beam deflected by a measurement cell filled with a liquid with known interfacial properties and the reference",
    "liquid one is able to infer the properties of the fluid of interest .    with these methods",
    "critical adsorption on homogeneous substrates has been experimentally investigated ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) . on chemically structured substrates",
    "mostly wetting experiments have been performed @xcite .",
    "the present paper extends theoretical work on critical adsorption on chemically homogeneous @xcite and topologically @xcite structured surfaces and work on wetting phenomena at chemically structured substrates @xcite to the case of critical adsorption on geometrically flat , but chemically structured surfaces .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : hom - sub ] we introduce our model and in order to set the stage we recall previous results on critical adsorption at homogeneous substrates . in sec.[sec : inhom - sub ] we present our results for the critical adsorption at chemically structured substrates .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "boundaries , which come into play when investigating confined systems , induce deviations from the bulk behavior . near a critical point",
    "the ising bulk universality class splits into three possible surface universality classes ( denoted as normal , special , and ordinary surface universality class , respectively ) characterized by surface critical exponents and amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions applied to the system determine the surface universality class the system belongs to .",
    "the behavior of the bulk is not affected by the boundaries .",
    "it has turned out that in the sense of renormalization group theory it is sufficient to describe the presence of the substrate by a surface field @xmath18 and the so - called surface enhancement @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "( these names originate from the corresponding description of surface magnetic phenomena @xcite , see also , c.f .",
    ", eq.([eq : ham - surf ] ) . )",
    "the surface enhancement is related to the couplings between the ordering degrees of freedom at the surface .",
    "the so - called ordinary surface universality class is characterized by a vanishing surface field and a positive surface enhancement ( @xmath20 ) which suppresses the order parameter at the surface below its bulk value . for magnetic systems",
    "this effect of missing bonds is the generic case .    the special surface universality class ,",
    "describing a multicritical point , requires in addition to a vanishing surface field a surface enhancement which within mean field theory vanishes ( @xmath21 ) and causes a flat order parameter profile in the vicinity of the substrate ; fluctuations induce a divergence of the order parameter profile at the surface .",
    "the normal surface universality class is characterized by a non - vanishing surface field and the absence of the surface enhancement ( @xmath22 ) which leads to an order parameter value at the surface larger than in the bulk , even above the critical temperature where the bulk value of the order parameter is 0 . for fluid systems",
    "the normal surface universality class is the generic case .",
    "in contrast , in the context of magnetism an order parameter which is larger at the surface than its value in the bulk can be obtained in the absence of surface fields but for a negative surface enhancement ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "since this is rather uncommon for magnetic systems , the normal surface universality class is also referred to as the so - called extraordinary surface universality class .",
    "the fact that the normal and the extraordinary cases are equivalent and identical at their fixed points , ( @xmath24 ) for fluid systems and ( @xmath25 ) for magnetic systems , and thus identical with respect to their asymptotic behavior , was predicted by bray and moore @xcite and later proven by burkhardt and diehl @xcite . in the following we shall focus on the normal and extraordinary surface universality classes , respectively .    a homogeneous substrate confining a binary liquid mixture inevitably has a preference for one of the two components .",
    "this preference becomes pronounced at the critical point and leads to an enrichment of the preferred component at the substrate . at the critical temperature the local order parameter profile decays algebraically towards its bulk value .",
    "this phenomenon has been called critical adsorption @xcite .    in the case of planar homogeneous substrates besides the correlation length @xmath26 the distance @xmath27 from the substrate is the other relevant length scale .",
    "if this length is scaled with the bulk correlation length @xmath26 , the order parameter profile @xmath28 takes the following scaling form at the fixed points ( @xmath24 ) and ( @xmath25 ) , respectively : @xmath29 with the scaling variable @xmath30 which describes the distance from the substrate in units of the correlation length @xmath31 .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath32 are universal after fixing the non - universal amplitude @xmath6 and the non - universal amplitude @xmath33 of the correlation length @xmath34 .",
