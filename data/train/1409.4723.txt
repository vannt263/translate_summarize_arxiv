    "this paper concerns the search for a recursive formula for how denominator vectors ( @xmath0-vectors ) change under mutation of _ initial _ seeds .",
    "it is widely expected ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ? * remark  7.7 ) ) that no satisfactory initial - seed - mutation recursion holds in general , and indeed we do not produce one . however , a very nice initial - seed - mutation recursion holds in a varied collection of cluster algebras ( including the case considered in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  7.7 ) ) .",
    "this recursion turns out to be equivalent to a beautiful duality formula in the style of the @xmath1-vectors/@xmath2-vectors dualities of nakanishi and zelevinsky @xcite .",
    "the first thing one notices when looking for such a recursion is that , to understand how denominators change when the initial seed is mutated , one must know something about a related family of integer vectors .",
    "specifically , if @xmath3 is the initial cluster , then the _ negation _ of the @xmath0-vector of a cluster variable @xmath4 is the vector of lowest powers of the @xmath5 occurring in the expression for @xmath4 as a laurent polynomial in @xmath6 .",
    "we define the * _ @xmath7-vector _ * of @xmath4 to be the vector of _ highest _ powers of the @xmath5 occurring in @xmath4 .",
    "our initial - seed - mutation recursion for @xmath0-vectors is equivalent to a description of the @xmath7-vectors in a given cluster in terms of the @xmath0-vectors in the same cluster .    in many cases",
    ", one can establish all three formulas by reading off the duality directly from expressions for denominator vectors found in the literature @xcite .",
    "in particular , all of them hold in finite type , in rank two , and more intriguingly , in nontrivial examples arising from marked surfaces .",
    "we conjecture that the initial - seed - mutation recursion holds in the case of source - sink moves in arbitrary cluster algebras .",
    "we prove this conjecture for cluster algebras arising from surfaces .",
    "besides their usefulness in understanding denominator vectors , the @xmath7-vectors may be of independent interest .",
    "a major goal in the study of cluster algebras is to give explicit formulas for the cluster variables .",
    "work in this direction includes realizing cluster variables as `` lambda lengths '' in the surfaces case @xcite , combinatorial formulas in rank two @xcite , in some finite types @xcite , and for some surfaces @xcite , and interpretations in terms of the representation theory of quivers , beginning with @xcite .",
    "short of a complete description of a cluster variable , one might instead describe its newton polytope ( the convex hull of the exponent vectors of the laurent monomials occurring in its laurent expansion ) .",
    "however , as far as the authors are aware , there are no results describing newton polytopes in cases where general formulas for the cluster variables are not known .",
    "( the newton polytope may also be interesting when an explicit formula for the cluster variable is available , as in @xcite . )    together , the @xmath0-vectors and @xmath7-vectors amount to coarse information about newton polytopes , namely their `` bounding boxes . ''",
    "given a polytope @xmath8 in @xmath9 , define the * _ tight bounding box _ * of @xmath8 to be the smallest box @xmath10\\times\\cdots\\times[a_n , b_n]$ ] containing @xmath8 .",
    "( readers who pay attention to bounding boxes of graphics files will find the notion familiar . )",
    "equivalently , for each @xmath11 , the values @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the minimum and maximum of the @xmath14 coordinates of points in @xmath8 .",
    "it is convenient to describe the tight bounding box by specifying the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the tight bounding box of the newton polytope of a laurent polynomial @xmath17 in @xmath6 is @xmath10\\times\\cdots\\times[a_n , b_n]$ ] such that @xmath12 is the lowest power of @xmath5 occurring in any laurent monomial of @xmath17 , and @xmath13 is the highest power of @xmath5 occurring .",
    "thus when @xmath4 is a cluster variable written as a laurent polynomial in the initial cluster @xmath3 , the tight bounding box of the newton polytope of @xmath4 is given by the negation of the @xmath0-vector and by the @xmath7-vector .",

    "however , we do nt need to consider that case because the surface is a twice - punctured monogon , and theorem  [ d surface ] applies .    if @xmath218 is the external edge of a monogon piece , then each of the two left internal arcs @xmath222 has @xmath289 , so @xmath218 is not a source .",
    "it remains , then , to consider how external edges of triangle and digon pieces can be sources .",
    "we need to consider two cases .",
    "suppose @xmath218 is an edge in a triangle piece and suppose @xmath222 is the edge reached from @xmath218 by traversing the boundary of the triangle in a counter - clockwise direction .",
    "if @xmath222 is not on the boundary , then the triangle contributes @xmath42 to @xmath288 , so @xmath218 can not be a source unless either @xmath222 is on the boundary or @xmath218 and @xmath222 are also in a second triangle that contributes @xmath253 to @xmath288 .",
    "next suppose @xmath218 is an external edge in a digon piece .",
    "if @xmath218 is the left edge , then each of the two internal arcs @xmath222 has @xmath289 , so @xmath218 is not a source .",
    "if @xmath218 is the right edge , let @xmath222 be the left edge .",
    "as in the triangle case , @xmath218 can not be a source unless either @xmath222 is on the boundary or @xmath218 and @xmath222 are also in a second triangle that contributes @xmath253 to @xmath288 .",
    "putting all of these observations together , we see that we must consider three more possibilities obtained by gluing a triangle or digon piece to another triangle or digon piece",
    ". we can glue two triangle pieces together along one edge with opposite edges of the resulting quadrilateral on the boundary as shown in the second picture in figure  [ configurations ] .",
    "conceivably the top and bottom arcs shown in the picture are identified , but we need not consider this case because then the surface is an annulus with two marked points on each boundary component , and theorem  [ d surface ] applies .",
    "we can glue two triangle pieces together along two edges , with one of the remaining edges on the boundary as shown in the third picture in figure  [ configurations ] .",
    "we can glue a triangle piece along one of its edges to the right edge of a digon piece , with both the left digon edge and the triangle edge counter - clockwise from the glued edge on the boundary , as shown in the fourth and last picture in figure  [ configurations ] .",
    "we can glue a triangle piece along two of its edges to the two edges of a digon piece , with the remaining edge of the triangle on the boundary , but we need not consider this case , because the surface is a twice - punctured monogon , and theorem  [ d surface ] applies .",
    "we can glue two digon pieces , right edge to right edge , with the remaining two edges on the boundary .",
    "however , we need not consider this case either , because the surface is a twice - punctured digon and theorem  [ d surface ] applies . finally , we can glue both edges of a digon piece to both edges of another digon piece , but in this case , we obtain a 3-times punctured sphere , which is explicitly disallowed in the definition of marked surfaces ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition  2.1 ) .",
    "thus the four configurations in figure  [ configurations ] are the only local configurations near arcs that are sources , except in surfaces to which theorem  [ d surface ] applies .",
    "we will see that the first and third configurations shown are essentially equivalent for our purposes .",
    "recall from section  [ d surface sec ] that @xmath233 is the sum of four quantities @xmath36 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath52 .",
    "as before , @xmath239 and @xmath240 are non - self - intersecting curves homotopic ( relative to the set of marked points ) to @xmath218 and @xmath85 respectively , intersecting with each other the minimum possible number of times , transversally each time .",
    "recall that @xmath263 unless @xmath239 is a loop . in the configurations of figure  [ configurations ]",
    ", @xmath239 is never a loop .",
    "furthermore , the quantity @xmath288 is nonzero only if @xmath222 is in a triangle with @xmath218 , and none of the arcs making triangles with @xmath218 is a loop in the configurations of figure  [ configurations ] .",
    "therefore , we can ignore @xmath237 in all the calculations of intersection numbers in this section .",
    "recall also that @xmath36 is the number of intersection points of @xmath239 and @xmath240 ( excluding intersections at their endpoints ) , that @xmath290 unless @xmath239 and @xmath240 coincide , in which case @xmath250 , and that @xmath52 is the number of ends of @xmath85 that are incident to an endpoint of @xmath218 and carry , at that endpoint , a different tag from the tag of @xmath218 at that endpoint .",
    "we observe that @xmath233 is invariant under changing all taggings of @xmath218 and of @xmath85 at some puncture .",
    "thus for the first ( leftmost ) picture in figure  [ configurations ] , we may as well take @xmath218 to be the arc tagged notched at the puncture .",
    "figure  [ labeled configurations ] shows the configurations of figure  [ configurations ] with some additional information .",
    "first , the arc @xmath282 , obtained by flipping @xmath218 , is shown and labeled . also , the arcs @xmath222 such that @xmath291 are labeled",
    "there is either one arc @xmath292 , two arcs @xmath292 and @xmath293 , or three arcs @xmath292 , @xmath293 and  @xmath294 .",
    "the pictures in figure  [ labeled configurations ] are re - ordered in the order we will consider them . we have also redrawn the last configuration more symmetrically .",
    "our task is simplified by several symmetries .",
    "we have already used the symmetry of changing taggings at a puncture . also , any symmetry of a configuration that fixed @xmath218 and @xmath282 or switches @xmath218 and @xmath282 preserves equation  .",
    "if the symmetry is orientation - reversing , the absolute value operation in   is crucial to the symmetry .",
    "( note however that this absolute value has been omitted in   because we took @xmath218 to be a source , not a sink . )",
    "we first consider the left picture in figure  [ labeled configurations ] . since each marked point is on the boundary , there are no relevant taggings .",
    "contributions to @xmath233 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 , and @xmath297 occur only when @xmath85 intersects the interior of the quadrilateral .",
    "while @xmath85 may intersect the interior of the quadrilateral a number of times , each intersection can be treated separately .",
    "in such an intersection , @xmath85 may either pass through the quadrilateral , terminate at a vertex of the quadrilateral , or connect two vertices of the quadrilateral .",
    "up to symmetry , as discussed above , there are only three possibilities .",
    "( the relevant symmetry group is the order-@xmath298 dihedral symmetry group of the rectangle shown . )",
    "figure  [ squarecase ] shows the possible intersections of @xmath85 ( shown as a dotted line ) with the quadrilateral , along with the contributions to @xmath233 , @xmath295 , @xmath296 , and @xmath297 .",
    "each of these is given in the form @xmath299 .",
    "the quantities @xmath300 and @xmath301 are both @xmath253 . in every case , we see that @xmath302 , and therefore holds .",
    "notice that the second and third pictures of figure  [ labeled configurations ] are related by a reflection that switches @xmath218 with @xmath282 . by the symmetry discussed above , we need only consider one of these configurations ; we will work with the third picture .",
    "contributions to @xmath233 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 only occur when @xmath85 intersects the digon , and again , we can treat each intersection separately .",
    "figure  [ twotricase ] shows many of the possible intersections of @xmath85 with the configuration , and shows @xmath233 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 , again in the form @xmath299 .      since @xmath305 ,",
    "the desired relation is @xmath306 , and we see that this relation holds in every case .",
    "not pictured in figure  [ twotricase ] are four cases , where @xmath240 coincides with @xmath239 or @xmath307 , with two possible taggings at the point in the center of the digon . in each of these cases , @xmath308 and the @xmath36 terms of @xmath233 and @xmath295 are both zero .",
    "the other terms are also zero , except that one of @xmath233 and @xmath295 has @xmath250 and one of @xmath233 and @xmath295 has @xmath309 .    finally , we consider the last picture in figure  [ labeled configurations ] .",
    "the two cases where @xmath240 coincides with @xmath239 or @xmath310 are handled analogously to the last case of the quadrilateral condition .",
    "up to symmetry , there are six remaining cases , pictured in figure  [ digontricase ] .",
