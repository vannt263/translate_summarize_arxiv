    "condensed matter states described by landau s theory are characterized by order parameters which are well - behaved , except at phase transitions , where they are related to symmetry breaking in the material structure .",
    "instead , topological insulators ( ti s ) @xcite constitute a recently discovered state of matter that presents topological order .",
    "in such materials the bulk is gapped as in conventional insulators , but they support gapless metallic surface states as a manifestation of topological order .",
    "these metallic states are protected by time reversal symmetry ( trs ) and their stability is robust against non - magnetic impurities or mechanical deformations on the surface . in addition , the carriers motion is shown to obey spin - momentum locking , with their spins lying on the surface and pointing perpendicularly to momentum everywhere @xcite .    such surface states may acquire a gap whenever trs is broken , for instance , by means of a magnetic perturbation ( applied field and/or film coating ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a superficial hall conductivity , @xmath0 , takes place ( we use cgs units ; @xmath1 is an integer , @xmath2 is the electronic charge , @xmath3 is the planck constant ) .",
    "thus , low energy topological insulating phase properties may be described in terms of the so - called topological magneto - electric effect ( tmee ) @xcite , which is a ( topological ) ground - state response function @xcite .",
    "such an effect may be readily encompassed in the usual electrodynamics , keeping the maxwell equations unaltered in form , but changing the constitutive relations according to @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the fine structure constant and @xmath6 is the electric - magnetic polarization @xcite . in conventional insulators",
    "@xmath7 , while it reads @xmath8/2= \\pm 1/2 $ ] for a ti .",
    "the direction of the surface magnetization , @xmath9 , determines the sign of @xmath6 : + ( - ) if it points out ( in ) to the surface ( @xmath10 is a unit vector normal to the surface ) .",
    "physically , we clearly realize how tmee dictates the unique electromagnetic behavior of a ti : an electric ( or magnetic ) field induces both an electric polarization and a magnetization in the ti .",
    "namely , an electric field crossing the surface of a topological insulator induces on it a hall current given by @xcite : @xmath11 this current clearly depends on the surface geometry , and its associated magnetic field may have special features .",
    "for instance , in a conical ti this current yields a topological electric polarization that depends on the cone aperture angle , say , under the same external conditions , wider ( @xmath12 ) and narrower ( @xmath13 ) cones appear to polarize in opposite directions @xcite . on the other hand , a point - like electric charge located near a ti flat surface induces a magnetic field resembling that produced by a magnetic monopole @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the ( image ) magnetic monopole in a ti is not an elementary neither an emergent excitation at all : it rather comes to be an artificial particle that describes the physical effects associated to the hall sources taking place in the surface of a ti , as described by tmee .",
    "therefore , the monopoles discussed here look like images of dirac magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "in addition , they should not be confused with the timely emergent monopoles observed in spin ice systems , even though in both cases the monopole appears attached to a physical string of dipoles .",
    "actually , in spin ices , the original degrees of freedom ( magnetic dipoles ) are shown to _ fractionate _ into isolated magnetic poles attached into pairs by physical strings @xcite .        here",
    ", we consider the case of a concave ti surface , say , a semispherical cavity .",
    "besides of realizing the induced image monopole , we also find that whenever the electric charge crosses the semisphere focus the magnetic charge of the monopole is reversed .",
    "physically , such a picture corresponds to a reversion in the rotation of the induced hall current exactly at the focus .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we firstly present the problem and its geometry . later , the problem is solved analytically within a number of assumptions .",
    "section 3 is devoted to better understanding the image monopole configuration , once the monopole appears attached to a string carrying both electric and magnetic charges .",
    "finally , we point out our conclusions and prospects for forthcoming works . [ an appendix is also provided in order to clarify some technical details ] .",
    "let the left half - space , @xmath14 , be a ti with an electric permittivity and magnetic permeability @xmath15 whereas the right side , @xmath16 , is occupied by an ordinary insulator with @xmath17 .",
    "a semispherical cavity , radius * r * centered at @xmath18 , is made in the ti , according to fig .",
    "let also the electric charge , @xmath19 , be placed along @xmath20-axis , say , at @xmath21 .",
    "whenever one breaks trs on the cavity surface , for instance , by coating it with a thin ferromagnetic film , a hall current is induced by the electric field produced by @xmath19 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : jhall ] ) , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ emt2 ] . for a while",
    ", if we restrict ourselves to the magnetic field produced by such a current one may realize that it is equivalent to that generated by an image magnetic monopole , @xmath22 , along with an image magnetic string extending from it to @xmath23 .",
    "however , as a whole the hall current produces both , electric and magnetic fields , in such a way that the image object induced carries both electric and magnetic charges , @xmath24 : _",
    "dyon_. in addition , there are also image strings carrying electric and magnetic charges extending from the dyon to @xmath25 , accounted respectively by @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig.[emt2 ] .",
    "the physical reason why such strings must be in order comes from the fact that @xmath28 , so that the total magnetic charge of the image string must exactly cancel the monopole charge : @xmath29 .",
    "in order to describe the magnetic field inside ti , there is also an image _ dyon _",
    "( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) located at @xmath21 and attached to a string ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) extending from it to the semisphere focus * f*. this picture is analogous to that realized in planar and spherical topological insulators , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main finding here concerns the reversion of the magnetic charge according the location of the electric charge : if @xmath19 is placed at @xmath34 ( on the right of the focus , * f * ) @xmath35 rotates clockwise , which corresponds to a negative magnetic monopole , @xmath36 ( panel a ) in fig.[emt2 ] ) , whereas for @xmath37 the current flows counter - clockwise , whose magnetic field resembles that produced by a positive monopole , @xmath38 , as depicted in panel b ) , fig.[emt2 ] .",
    "the electric charge of the dyon , @xmath39 does not experience any inversion in its sign as charge @xmath19 crosses the focus , neither do the image charges inside the cavity .    in order to show the results above in further details ,",
    "let us consider the simple situation where both dielectrics have the same @xmath40 , say , @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , consider only the first order contribution to the electric field , say , that due to the charge @xmath19 : @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath35 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jhall ] ) , proportional to @xmath43 , as follows :    @xmath44    where we have used @xmath45 .",

    "above , one clearly realize the magnetic charge reversion whenever the charge @xmath19 crosses the cavity focus , @xmath47 . taking this current to the biot - savart equation , we obtain its generated magnetic field , @xmath48 , eq .",

    "[ frev ] are clear evidences of the monopole , and may be better understood whenever @xmath19 is taken close to @xmath51 , as shown in fig . [ plapp ] .",
    "therefore , near the interface one experiences a magnetic field largely dominated by the monopole , so that as @xmath52 one practically realize only the point - like monopole itself .",
    "this is an expected result , since whenever one approaches the interface one should recover the result of a plane ti discussed in @xcite , say : charge @xmath19 induces an image point - like magnetic monopole .",
    "essentially , the contribution due the image magnetic string is very small . geometrically speaking , whenever @xmath19 is close to the interface",

    "note the large increasing in the magnitude of @xmath48 as one places the charge near to the interface , @xmath54 , and , at the same time we take the probe , a magnetic tip , for example , also close to the cavity surface.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",

    "the monopole is slightly shifted around its exact position , @xmath56 , by @xmath57 . at each of these shifted positions ,",
    "the field due to the monopole alone approaches the real field , eq .",
    "( [ magneticfield ] ) . actually , if the monopole is taken to @xmath58 its field fits that due to the induced hall current with high precision . such results",
    "further support the picture of the physical situation as that provided by a point - like magnetic monopole , namely , when we are close to the interface .",
    "but , how close does this picture remains valid ?",
    "as wee shall see below , it is in good accordance even if the charge is taken to about @xmath59 , provided that the probe is kept near to the interface , @xmath60 .",

    "@xcite the authors have found that the strength of the image magnetic monopole decreases with the inverse of the distance between the electric charge and the center of the spherical surface . here , by virtue of the negative curvature of the semispherical cavity , the magnitude linearly increases , as shown in fig .",

    "behavior of the image magnetic monopole strength as the electric charge is taken apart from the interface . since monopole strength",

    "this is not surprising , once as seen far away , the set magnetic string plus monopole looks like a magnetic dipole around @xmath58 . at some extent , this is what happens with the tip of a magnetic needle , as reported in ref.@xcite .    on the other hand , hall current field spreads throughout the bulk of the topological insulator , as well .",
    "therefore , from the point of view of an observer located inside the bulk , the magnetic field seems to be that produced by an image magnetic monopole , @xmath31 , located at @xmath21 , along with a string , @xmath67 .",
    "then , as a whole , such an observer see a picture similar to that described by now : all the electromagnetic field resembles that generated by a dyon placed at @xmath21 along with a string carrying both electric and magnetic charges , but extending from the monopole to the focus .",
    "in summary , we have seen that an electric charge placed near to a semispherical topological insulator cavity induces a superficial hall current which reverses its rotation whenever the charge crosses the semisphere focus .",
    "such a current is known to generate a magnetic field analogous that produced by an image magnetic monopole .",
    "thus , current reversion is shown to be equivalent to invert the sign of the magnetic monopole .    experimentally , to probe both monopole and its reversion a number of pre - requisites",
    "must be fulfilled .",
    "first , a gap must be open in the surface states of the ti in a such a way that the fermi level is kept within the gap . an efficient way for doing that is by doping the as - grown ti with @xmath68 and @xmath69 dopants @xcite .",
    "later , let the ti cavity be coated with a soft ferromagnetic insulator , say , whose magnetization points normal to its surface .",
    "now , whenever placing the electric charge near the cavity , its induced magnetic field does modify the film magnetization whose profile is dependent on the monopole parameters , like strength and sign ( fig.[exp2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) may be used to probe such a magnetization pattern . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "if we consider a cavity of radius @xmath70 , then an electric charge around @xmath71 induces a magnetic field about @xmath72 , which is enough to modify the magnetization of the film in a detectable way .",
