    "laser control of molecular rotation , alignment and orientation has received significant attention in recent years ( for a review , see e.  g.  @xcite ) .",
    "interest in the field has increased , mainly due to the improved capabilities to manipulate characteristics of the laser pulses ( such as time duration and temporal shape ) , which in turn leads to potential applications offered by controlling the angular distribution of molecules . since the typical rotational motion is slow ( @xmath0 ) with respect to the typical short pulse ( @xmath1 ) , effective rotational control and manipulation are in reach . during the last decade ,",
    "temporal rotational dynamics of pulse - excited molecules was studied @xcite , and multiple pulse sequences giving rise to the enhanced alignment were suggested @xcite and realized @xcite .",
    "further manipulations such as optical molecular centrifuge and alignment - dependent strong field ionization of molecules were demonstrated @xcite .",
    "selective rotational excitation in bimolecular mixtures was suggested and demonstrated in the mixtures of molecular isotopes @xcite and molecular spin isomers @xcite .",
    "recently , several groups suggested a method for exciting field - free unidirectional molecular rotation , in which the angular momentum along the laser beam propagation direction is provided by two properly delayed ultrashort laser pulses that are linearly polarized at 45 degrees to each other @xcite .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of the effect was done in @xcite for benzene molecules .",
    "the mechanism behind this double - pulse scheme is rather clear , and is most easily explained in the case of linear molecules @xcite .",
    "the first ultrashort laser pulse , linearly polarized along the @xmath2-axis , impulsively induces coherent molecular rotation that continues after the end of the pulse .",
    "the molecules rotate under field - free conditions until they reach an aligned state , in which the molecular axis with the highest polarizability is confined in a narrow cone around the polarization direction of the first pulse .",
    "the second short laser pulse is applied at the moment of the best alignment , and at an angle with respect to the first pulse . as a result ,",
    "the aligned molecular ensemble experiences a torque causing molecular rotation in the plane defined by the two polarization vectors .",
    "the torque acting on a linear molecule is maximal when the laser pulse is polarized at 45 degrees with respect to the molecular axis of the highest polarizability .",
    "this defines the optimal angle between the laser pulses .",
    "the direction of the excited rotation ( clockwise or counter - clockwise ) is determined by the sign of the relative angle ( @xmath3 degrees ) between the first and the second pulse in the polarization plane . this double pulse scheme",

    "[ propeller ] ) was termed `` molecular propeller '' @xcite , as it resembles the action ( side kick ) needed to ignite a rotation of a plane propeller .",
    "the heuristic arguments presented above are , in fact , essentially classical , although it is clear that a detailed quantum analysis may be needed to consider the long - time evolution of the excited molecules , or the operation of this scheme at relatively weak pulses when only low - lying rotational states are involved .",
    "that is why all the previous treatments of the problem @xcite presented full - scale quantum - mechanical studies , combining both analytical and numerical methods .    in the present paper ,",
    "we provide a detailed comparison between the classical and the quantum - mechanical analysis of the double pulse scheme for exciting unidirectional molecular rotation , both for linear molecules and for benzene ( that was the object of the experiment in @xcite )",
    ". we will demonstrate the predictive power of the classical treatment that correctly prescribes the optimal delay between the pulses , and the angle between them , and will find the advantages and limitations of such an approach in quantitative description of the effect at experimental conditions .",
    "we believe that by comparing the complementary classical and fully quantum mechanical views on the same phenomenon , the reader will get a comprehensive idea about the underlying physics .",
    "recent paper @xcite studied quantum - mechanically the `` molecular propeller '' scheme in the case of linear molecules .",
    "dependence of the induced angular momentum on the pulses intensity , and the delay between them , was analyzed .",
    "moreover , the angular distribution of linear molecules subject to unidirectional rotation was considered , and it was shown to be confined in the plane defined by the two polarization vectors of the pulses .",
    "this anisotropic angular distribution was characterized by the observable @xmath4 , which was referred to as the azimuthal factor .    in the present paper",
    ", we describe the same scheme using a classical description of the double - pulse molecular excitation , followed by a monte carlo averaging over the thermal ensemble .",
    "we compare the time dependence of the azimuthal factor according to the classical analysis , to the quantum mechanical one , and show that both results coincide for initial times .",
    "in addition , we introduce a long - time - averaged angular distribution function , which conveniently depicts the molecular orientation following the excitation .",
    "this distribution function seems to behave similarly in the classical and quantum cases .",
    "finally , we analyze classically the excitation of the unidirectional rotation for more complicated oblate symmetric top molecules , like benzene , and compare this analysis with the full quantum - mechanical treatment of the problem .",
    "the outline of the paper is as following . in sec .",
    "ii we study classically the rotational motion of a linear molecule kicked by a pair of short nonresonant laser pulses that are linearly polarized in arbitrary directions . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the response of a thermal ensemble of linear molecules to such an excitation by using the monte carlo method . angular distribution function and its time - averaged behavior are studied in sec .",
    "iv , and the results are compared to the full quantum mechanical treatment . in sec .",
    "v , we analyze ( both classically and quantum mechanically ) the problem of inducing unidirectional rotation of benzene molecules . sec .",
    "vi summarizes and concludes our study .",

    "@xmath9 are the polar and the azimuthal angles characterizing the direction of the molecular axis , respectively .",
    "we assume the pulse duration is very short compared to the rotational period , so that the pulse can be described in the impulsive ( @xmath10-kick ) approximation .",
    "we define the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath11 , which characterizes the pulse , as @xmath12    let us remind again the pulse sequence producing unidirectionally rotating molecules @xcite : ( 1 ) at time @xmath13 molecules are kicked by a pulse linearly polarized along the @xmath2-axis ; ( 2 ) at the time of the maximal molecular alignment ( @xmath14 , which is the moment when the alignment factor @xmath15 reaches the maximum value ) , a second pulse is applied , polarized at 45 degrees to the @xmath2-axis ( we choose the polarization vector to be in the @xmath16-@xmath2 plane ) .",
    "we represent the molecule by a unit vector pointing from the center of mass towards one of the atoms ( the center of mass is defined as the coordinates origin ) .",

    "obviously , later fractional and full revivals are quantum features , which are not reproduced by the classical treatment .",
    "it is also evident that the time averaged azimuthal factor ( that is around 0.52 here ) coincides for the classical and the quantum calculation .",
    "this value is higher than the isotropic value of 0.5 , hence the molecular distribution is squeezed towards the plane defined by the polarization directions of the first and the second pulses .",
    "we see that a relatively simple classical model reproduces the important features of this problem .",
    "in this section we estimate classically the angular distribution function of an ensemble of linear molecules excited by two pulses , and compare it with the results of full quantum - mechanical simulation @xcite . to achieve this goal",

    "@xmath88 denotes the molecule number in the monte carlo realization ) is by referring to the angle @xmath89 between the unit vector to this point , and the unit vector to a general point @xmath18 in its neighborhood : @xmath90 .",

    "normalizing the two dimensional surface gaussian function , we finally obtain the following estimate for the time dependent distribution function : @xmath98    an important object showing the symmetry and anisotropy of our system is the time - averaged angular distribution function . a straightforward , but somewhat cumbersome way to generate it is by numerical averaging the distribution function ( [ td_distribution ] ) over a long time period . a much simpler approach to time averaging is described below . after the end of the pulses ,",
