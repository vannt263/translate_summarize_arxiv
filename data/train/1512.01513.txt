    "all monoids and semigroups appearing in this work are commutative . for this reason , we omit this adjective in the sequel .    given two non - negative integers @xmath2 with @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath4 the remainder of the euclidean division of @xmath5 by @xmath6 for a rational number @xmath7 with @xmath8 we say that @xmath9 if @xmath10 and for two rational numbers @xmath7 and @xmath11 we say that @xmath12 if @xmath13 a proportionally modular diophantine inequality in one variable is an expression of the form @xmath14 with @xmath5 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 positive integers .",
    "the set @xmath17 of non - negative integer solutions of that modular inequality is a numerical semigroup , that is , it is a subset of the set of non - negative integers @xmath18 that is closed under addition , @xmath19 and @xmath20 has finitely many elements .",
    "so , the submonoids of @xmath18 of the form @xmath21 are called proportionally modular numerical semigroups .",
    "they were introduced in @xcite , and many papers about them have been written ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this work , we introduce proportionally modular affine semigroups as a generalization of proportionally modular numerical semigroups .",
    "instead of using three integers @xmath2 and @xmath16 , we use two nonnull linear functions @xmath22 and a natural number @xmath6 with these elements , we define the semigroup @xmath23 which it is called proportionally modular affine semigroup . in theorem",
    "[ thfg ] , we provide an algorithm to compute the minimal generating of @xmath24 besides , we prove that the intersection of every rational straight line with a proportionally modular affine semigroup is isomorphic to a proportionally modular numerical semigroup .",
    "this makes possible to view every proportionally modular affine semigroup as a beam of proportionally modular numerical semigroups .    in the second part of this work , we focus on proportionally modular affine semigroups of @xmath25 and we explore some of their properties . using that any nontrivial proportionally modular affine semigroup @xmath17 of @xmath25 is simplicial , we study some of the properties of its associated semigroup ring @xmath26 $ ] from the semigroup @xmath24 these properties are the cohen - macaulayness , gorensteiness and buchsbaumness , which have been widely studied in ring theory , but if we try to search these kind of rings , few methods to obtain them are found ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , we prove that these semigroups are cohen - macaulay and buchsbaum , and we characterize when they are gorenstein .",
    "that allows us to affirm that an application of modular diophantine inequalities to commutative algebra is the construction of special kinds of rings .",
    "for these semigroups , we also give a geometrical algorithm for a fast computation of the minimal generating set of @xmath27 and we determinate the ( minimal ) frobenius vectors of these semigroups ( some references to frobenius vectors are found in @xcite and @xcite ) . in this work , all the examples have been done using the software available at @xcite .",
    "the content of this work is organized as follows : in section [ preliminaires ] , we provide some basic definitions and results on monoids and semigroup rings . in section",
    "[ p - m - a - s ] , we give the definition of proportionally modular semigroup , we represent it as beams of proportionally numerical semigroups , and we show an algorithm to compute its minimal generating set . in section [ n2 ] ,",
    "we provide a faster algorithm to obtain a system of generators of a given proportionally modular affine semigroup of @xmath25 . for this semigroup",
    ", we also give its set of ( minimal ) frobenius vectors .",
    "finally , in section [ propiedades_n2 ] , we study methods to check the above mentioned properties of the semigroup ring of a proportionally modular affine semigroup of @xmath28",
    "a semigroup is a pair @xmath29 , with @xmath17 a nonempty set and @xmath30 a binary operation defined on @xmath17 verifying the associative law .",
    "in addition , if there exists an element @xmath19 such that @xmath31 for all @xmath32 , we say that @xmath29 is a monoid . given a subset @xmath33 of a monoid @xmath17 ,",
    "the monoid generated by @xmath33 , denoted by @xmath34 , is the least ( with respect to inclusion ) submonoid of @xmath17 containing @xmath33 .",
    "when @xmath35 , we say that @xmath17 is generated by @xmath33 or that @xmath33 is a system of generators of @xmath17 .",
    "the monoid @xmath17 is finitely generated if it has a finite generating set .",
    "finitely generated submonoids of @xmath0 are known as affine semigroups , and they are called numerical semigroups when @xmath36    given a system of linear equations or linear inequalities , a solution is called @xmath18-solution if it is a non - negative integer solution ( see @xcite for details ) . for a subset @xmath37 , denote by @xmath38 the convex hull of the set @xmath33 , that is , the smallest convex subset of @xmath39 containing @xmath33 .",

    "we say that @xmath17 is a cohen - macaulay / gorenstein / buchsbaum semigroup if @xmath26 $ ] is a cohen - macaulay / gorenstein / buchsbaum ring .",
    "let @xmath22 be two nonnull linear functions and let @xmath62 . if @xmath63 verify @xmath64 and @xmath65 , by the linearity of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 . clearly , @xmath69 .",
    "in this way , the set of @xmath70solutions of every inequality of the form @xmath64 is a submonoid of @xmath0 .",
    "every submonoid @xmath17 of @xmath0 obtained as above is called a proportionally modular monoid .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 for all @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . if @xmath76 , then an element @xmath77 verifies @xmath64 if and only if @xmath78 .",
    "hence , by multiplying the inequality @xmath64 by @xmath79 the least common multiple of the denominators of @xmath80 and @xmath15 , we obtain an inequality where @xmath81 and the coefficients of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are integers .",
    "so , in the sequel , we assume that @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "[ pmeje ] if we intersect @xmath17 with any axis , the set obtained is formed by the elements of @xmath0 fulfilling a proportionally modular diophantine inequality or it is equal to @xmath86 .",

    "the element @xmath99 is in @xmath18 and @xmath100 belongs to @xmath101 .",

    "we suppose now that @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath106 be the nonnull element of @xmath91 closest to the origin verifying that @xmath107 . by the linearity of @xmath67 we have @xmath108 and thus @xmath109 .",

    "this proof is tailored to these semigroups .    [ thfg ] every proportionally modular monoid of @xmath0 is finitely generated .",
    "we suppose again that @xmath72 with @xmath122 , and denote the @xmath123-tuple @xmath124 by @xmath45 .",

    "so , we obtain that @xmath138    take @xmath139 and assume that @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",

    "note that @xmath152 with @xmath153 is again a frobenius vector .",
    "in this section we study the cohen - macaulayness , gorensteinness and buchsbaumness of proportionally modular affine semigroups of @xmath28 for this objective we consider only simplicial proportionally modular semigroups , and this occurs if the coefficients @xmath154 and @xmath155 of @xmath156 are not both lesser than or equal to zero . denote by @xmath17 the proportionally modular semigroup of the @xmath18-solutions of @xmath157 and by @xmath158 the set defined after proposition [ fgn2 ] .",
    "again , @xmath159 is the vector defined in definition [ vectoru ] and @xmath160 is the vector that appears after proposition [ fgn2 ] .          as in the proof proposition",
    "[ fgn2 ] , if @xmath154 and @xmath155 satisfies @xmath169 @xmath170 is finite .",
    "so , @xmath17 is simplicial but does not satisfy the second condition of proposition [ c - m ] , and thus @xmath17 is not cohen - macaulay . for this reason , in what follows we assume that @xmath171 besides , we assume that the trivial case @xmath172 does not happen . fixed these conditions , next result characterizes the cohen - macaulay proportionally modular semigroup .      with the fixed conditions , the semigroup @xmath17 is an affine simplicial semigroup ( proposition [ fgn2 ] ) and the vector @xmath159 can be considered as one of the minimal generator @xmath166 or @xmath167 appearing in proposition [ c - m ] . by lemma [ traslacionu ] , for any @xmath173 it is verified that @xmath174 so , @xmath17 is cohen - macaulay .",
    "we focus now our attention on the gorenstein property .",
    "we characterize this property in terms of the intersection of the apry sets of some minimal generators belonging to the extremal rays of its associated cone .",

    "let @xmath175 be an element belonging to @xmath184 using a similar argument of the proof of proposition [ fgn2 ] , we obtain that @xmath185 is the set @xmath186 note that the vectors @xmath159 and @xmath160 can be considered as the minimal generators @xmath166 and @xmath167 of theorem [ gorenstein_rosales ] , and then @xmath187 therefore , @xmath188      for the last result of this work we have to define a semigroup associated to @xmath24 in general , given an affine semigroup @xmath162 minimally generated by @xmath189 , denote by @xmath190 the affine semigroup @xmath191 . in @xcite , it is given a characterization of buchsbaum simplicial semigroups @xmath162 in terms of their semigroups @xmath190 .",
