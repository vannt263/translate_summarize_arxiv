    "curvature - related level set models have been proposed in many problems of image and surface processing , due to their well understood analytical features and nice smoothing properties . in this paper",
    ", we consider one of such models , related to the problem of reconstructing a surface from a discrete set of points on it .    for @xmath0 ,",
    "let @xmath1 be a discrete set of points in @xmath2 , which are to be understood as points on a surface ( or a curve if @xmath3 ) , from which the surface itself has to be reconstructed .",
    "the set @xmath4 will be also termed as `` data set '' in what follows , and we assume that its points might be affected by noise .",
    "thus , the reconstructed surface is not expected to pass through each of the data set points , but rather ( depending on the criterion used to perform the reconstruction ) to provide some trade - off between an exact interpolation and a smooth behaviour .    a level set model for this problem has been proposed by zhao et al . in @xcite , and leads to the following evolutive problem @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the euclidean distance from the set @xmath4 , and @xmath7 denotes the gradient operator . as customary in level set methods , the reconstructed surface at a given time @xmath8 is represented as the zero - level set of the solution @xmath9 , that is , @xmath10 in fact , is related to an energy functional in which the @xmath11 norm of the distance from @xmath4 is integrated on the whole surface ( see @xcite ) . more precisely , given a surface @xmath12 , we define the energy @xmath13 as the surface integral @xmath14 and look for a minimum of this functional ( this has the clear meaning of a compromise between the total surface of @xmath12 and its distance from the data set @xmath4 ) .",
    "once we define the evolution of an initial guess @xmath15 for the surface along the gradient flow of @xmath13 , and express the surface at time @xmath8 as the zero - level set of a function @xmath9 as in , we obtain .",
    "details about the derivation of this model may be found in @xcite , whereas well - posedness of can be proved in the framework of viscosity solutions ( see @xcite ) , which requires minimal regularity assumptions on the solution .    here , we are interested in the stationary version of , that is , @xmath16 which plays the role of an euler  lagrange equation for the energy @xmath13 and should be satisfied at local minima of the energy . in particular",
    ", a solution of will be obtained in what follows as a regime solution of for @xmath17 .",
    "we quote that similar techniques , retaining the regularizing effect of curvature - like terms , but possibly based on different evolution operators , are proposed for example in @xcite .    of course , level set methods are not the only strategy used to solve the problem of surface reconstruction  for example , segmentation techniques have been successfully proposed for this problem in recent years ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the largest amount of literature on the topic is probably devoted to least squares techniques . while we give up a complete review of this line of research , we mention that a relatively recent and successful technique in this framework makes use of radial basis functions ( rbf ) space reconstructions , whose application to surface reconstruction stems from pioneering works published in the late 90s @xcite ( see also @xcite for a general review ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the application of semi - lagrangian ( sl ) numerical techniques to , focusing in particular on their implementation with rbf space reconstructions .",
    "the application of rbf techniques to sl schemes has gained a certain popularity , although it has been restricted so far to the case of hyperbolic problems ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the literature therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "semi - lagrangian schemes for curvature - related equations have been first proposed in @xcite and has gone through a number of improvements and applications ( see , in particular , @xcite for an in - depth convergence analysis and @xcite for two applications to image processing , along with @xcite for a general review on sl schemes ) . in this framework , rbf would be expected to provide a more flexible tool to construct a sparse space reconstruction .",
    "in fact , since their construction is not based on a space grid , radial basis functions allow in principle for a sparse implementation , as well as for local refinements , although we are not aware of general strategies which could effectively handle rbfs in very disordered geometries .",
    "we propose therefore a _ structured , but local _ rbf space reconstruction in which one could better focus on the region close to the data set , instead of working on a full ( and computationally more expensive ) grid .",
    "this will be the final goal of the paper .",
    "we mention that , despite being constructed by different numerical tools , our scheme implements a `` localization '' of the numerical effort , much in the same spirit of the multigrid / multilevel techniques shown in @xcite .",
    "we finally remark that , while a model like might not be rated as the cutting - edge technique for surface reconstruction , yet the coupling of sl schemes with localized rbf space reconstructions shows a good potential in terms of accuracy and computational cost , and seems to be valuably applicable to a wider class of problems ( in particular , level set models as the one under consideration ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ schema ] will review the basic principles of construction of a sl scheme for , as well as the underlying ideas of rbf interpolation .",
    "section [ test ] will show numerical tests of increasing difficulty in two and three space dimensions , with both full and reduced grids .",
    "we sketch in this section the construction of a sl approximation to .",
    "we start by sketching the basic ideas on the two dimensional case , then give the three - dimensional version of the scheme , and last describe the main improvements and modifications for the case of rbf space interpolations .",
    "the main feature of the sl scheme under consideration is to be explicit , yet not constrained by the classic `` parabolic cfl '' condition , typical in the explicit treatment of diffusion terms .",
    "the degenerate diffusion performed by the curvature operator is treated by means of a convex combination of ( interpolated ) values of the numerical solution at the previous step , as we will soon show .",
    "before introducing the scheme , we rewrite the mean curvature operator in such a way that the derivation of the method will be more natural .",
    "let us recall that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the identity matrix , and @xmath20 is a matrix which projects the diffusion on the tangent plane of each level surface .",
    "the projection @xmath21 is a matrix of rank @xmath22 with @xmath22 eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath23 , and can be written as @xmath24 for a @xmath25 matrix @xmath26 having these eigenvectors as columns .    in the case",
    "@xmath3 , there is only one eigenvector orthogonal to the gradient , namely @xmath27 in this case , the operator can be rewritten as @xmath28 , the projection matrix @xmath29 is a @xmath30 matrix of rank 2 spanning the two - dimensional space orthogonal to the gradient of @xmath31 .",
    "the two orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath29 are : @xmath32 and , once set @xmath33 , the mean curvature operator can be rewritten as @xmath34 we will derive the scheme from this form , which corresponds to the probabilistic interpretation described in @xcite .      in the two - dimensional case , the scheme has the structure @xmath35\\left(x_j+\\d t\\ > d d(x_j)+\\sqrt{2 \\d t\\ > d(x_j ) } \\>\\sigma^n_j\\right)+ \\\\ \\displaystyle \\hspace{1.3 cm } + \\frac{1}{2}i[u^n]\\left(x_j+\\d t\\ >",

    "the term @xmath51 clearly represents an upwinding along the advection field @xmath52 , as usual in sl schemes . on the other hand ,",
    "the degenerate operator related to curvature is treated by adding a further displacement @xmath53 , which has the effect of generating a diffusion along the tangent space of the level sets , according to the curvature operator .",
    "more explicitly , can be rewritten via minor algebraic manipulations as @xmath54(x_j+\\d t\\ > d",

    "is carried out in @xcite .",
    "singular points at which @xmath56 ( where the definition would not make sense ) are to be treated by suitable techniques .",
    "a typical choice ( see @xcite ) is to replace the degenerate diffusion with an isotropic one ( e.g. , the heat operator ) whenever the approximate gradient is below a given threshold , say , @xmath57 , for a proper choice of the constant @xmath58 and the exponent @xmath59 . more explicitly , in a form parallel to , by computing the diffusion term as a 5-point laplacian",

    "the computational effort has therefore to be concentrated in this latter region ",
    "computing an accurate solution away from the data set is useless .",
    "keeping this idea in mind , we implement with a space reconstruction in the form of a radial basis function ( rbf ) interpolation , which lends itself to a sparse implementation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we have used here the matlab rbf interpolation toolbox described in @xcite .",

    "a structured , full - grid implementation of rbf space reconstruction gives essentially no advantage with respect to a more conventional interpolation .",
    "for all these reasons , we will implement the following strategy :    * in order to have a clear guideline for choosing the scale parameter @xmath85 , nodes are distributed over a _ reduced , but structured set _ ,",
    "i.e. , we start from a structured orthogonal grid and keep only the nodes belonging to some given neigbourhood of the data set . for example",
    ", we can use nodes @xmath88 for which @xmath89 for some suitable threshold @xmath90 .",
    "the nodes of the data set are also used as rbf nodes . as an example ,",
    "[ test1dgrid ] shows data set points as circles in red , and rbf nodes as asterisks in blue .",
    "note that taking @xmath91 results in creating a reduced grid containing about @xmath92 layers of nodes both inside and outside @xmath4 .",
    "* it is known that rbf are particularly unsuitable to extrapolate a function at points far from the region covered by the nodes . in order to keep the nodes concentrated near the data set , still avoiding instabilities when far from this region",
    ", we introduce a set @xmath93 of _ anchor nodes _ in which the numerical solution has a prescribed value , possibly both inside and outside the curve / surface to be reconstructed .",
    "anchor nodes essentially work as boundary conditions , by locking the value of the numerical solution at `` far '' points where the computation of rbf interpolation can not be ( and in fact is not required to be ) accurate . + referring again to fig .",
    "[ test1dgrid ] , anchor nodes appear as the outer crosses in black . in our numerical tests ,",
    "the anchor nodes have been placed on a frame surrounding the data set , following the geometry of the edges of the computational domain . in any of the tests",
    ", no anchor node has been used inside the data set .",
    "we will show in the section on numerical examples that this framework results in a considerable reduction of the computational grid , still preserving robustness of the algorithm .",
    "[ [ initial - condition ] ] initial condition + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to speed up convergence , the initial condition should have a zero - level set @xmath94 _ as close as possible to the surface ( or curve ) to be reconstructed _ , although , of course , the surface itself is unknown .",
    "moreover , a natural choice for the initial condition @xmath95 would be the signed distance from the initial interface @xmath15 , that is , @xmath96 in practice , since we look for an asymptotic solution for , it turns out that neither the choice of @xmath15 nor the structure of @xmath97 is critical  clearly , a better initial conditions results in a faster solution . in lack of a sharper information , a relatively conservative choice of the initial condition might be set as @xmath98 with a suitable choice of the constants @xmath99 in order to start from a zero - level set enclosing the data set , but not too far from it .",
    "this choice , which will be used in the numerical examples of the next section , avoids the cost of computing the signed distance , but maintains negative values for @xmath31 inside the surface @xmath100 , and positive values outside .",
    "we did not experience any critical behaviour of the scheme with respect to this choice , nor the need for a re - initialization of the level set function .",
    "in fact , the effect of the advection term in is to push the solution towards the data set , and this causes the solution to maintain a steep transition in the neighbourhood of the interface .",

    ", we will also compare the reduced grid with the full grid scheme .",
    "note that , in two dimensions , it is known ( see @xcite ) that a polygonal line joining the points of the data set is a local minimizer of the energy , so this should be regarded as an `` exact solution '' for the 2d case . in all the test ,",
    "we compute the normalized @xmath11-norm of the update between two successive iterates : @xmath101 this being an indication on the speed of convergence to the regime solution .",
    "note that , when plotted on a semi - log scale ( as it will be done in what follows ) , a linear decrease of @xmath102 suggests a contraction - like behaviour of the scheme .    in the following examples",
    ", we will keep the data set in a quite sparse form .",
    "we found it discriminating to work with a relatively low number of points , and this will be our strategy in order to check the robustness of the numerical algorithm .",
