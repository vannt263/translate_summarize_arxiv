    "in computerized tomography ( ct ) a patient is being scanned by a rotating illuminating source ( e.g. x - ray ) and the projections of the rays passing through the body are being recorded on an array of sensors .",
    "these projections are then used to reconstruct either a cross section of the scanned body ( 2d ct ) or the whole scanned body ( 3d ct ) . over the past decades",
    "ct became very popular in medical imaging because it enables the physician to visualize the internal structure of the patient , or at least some properties of it ( e.g. x - ray attenuation ) , without the need to actually invade the patient interior .",
    "in the current paper we consider the helical cone beam ( hcb ) 3d ct . in this system , while a cone beam x - ray source and a 2d array of sensors are rotating around the scanned body , the bed with the body is moving along the rotational axis .",
    "the result , from the scanned body point of view , is equivalent to the x - ray source and sensor array moving along a helical path .",
    "clearly , this scanning method exposes the patient to large quantities of radiation and results in very large amounts of data being collected and stored .",
    "both these facts are prime motivators for the development of an efficient , reduced rate , sampling pattern which is the goal of the work presented here .    it is known that theoretically , given the projections data , one can reconstruct the scanned body in both the 2d and 3d cases",
    ". however , in practice , only sampled versions of these projections are available . clearly ,",
    "if the sampling is sufficiently dense , the body image can be reconstructed to any desired quality . however , as sampling rate is closely associated with the amount of radiation to which the scanned body is exposed , the challenge is to sample as efficiently as possible while still maintaining a satisfactory reconstructed image quality .",
    "dose reduction in ct has drawn a considerable attention recently .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was shown that the equally sloped tomography algorithm can achieve good reconstruction quality with reduced x - ray dose . in the last decade , a sparsity",
    "prior has been used extensively to reduce the sampling rate in a variety of applications ( e.g. @xcite ) and to super - resolve signals @xcite .",
    "particularly , several attempts were made to reduce the sampling rate by compressed sensing methods @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our work does not build upon a sparsity assumption and contributes to the ongoing effort by showing that the standard uniform sampling leads to significant redundancy .",
    "the common sampling used is uniform sampling .",
    "rattey and lindgran @xcite were the first to investigate the possibility of a more efficient ( i.e. reduced rate ) sampling pattern for the parallel beam 2d ct .",
    "they observed that the impulse response of the scanning system has a bow - tie shape in the frequency domain and used the concept of essential bandwidth to derive an interlaced sampling pattern of lower density , while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed image .",
    "natterer in @xcite and desbat et al . in @xcite",
    "have generalized this result to the 2d fan beam case and 3d fan beam case , respectively .",
    "we generalize these works , calculate ( essential ) bounds on the support in the frequency domain and use these to suggest an efficient sampling pattern for the hcb ct . a reduction of up to a factor of @xmath0 in sampling rate is suggested .",
    "the sampling pattern involves a particular low - pass filtering before sampling . in the presence of noise",
    ", this preliminary filtering will reduce the effects of measurement noise .",
    "this point will become clearer after the mathematical analysis of the following sections .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce some notation and the system geometry . in section 3 , which is the main part of this paper ,",
    "we analyze the frequency domain of the hcb scan and calculate bounds on its essential support . in section 4",
    "we use this analysis to suggest an efficient sampling pattern . in section 5",
    "we compare reconstructions of a common phantom using our sampling scheme with the standard sampling and finally , in section 6 , we summarize the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "let us start with some notations .",
    "we use @xmath1 ^{t } $ ] for the cartesian coordinate systems , @xmath2 to denote linear convolution and @xmath3 to denote the floor operation .",
    "let the function @xmath4 be an unknown smooth attenuation function which represents a patient to be scanned .",
    "we recall that the fourier transform of the function @xmath4 is given by @xmath5the function @xmath4 is confined to a cylinder of radius @xmath6 and is scanned by a scanner which rotates at radius @xmath7 .",
    "the scanned patient bed is moving along the @xmath8-axis at a constant rate .",
    "the result is equivalent to having the scanned body stationary and the scanning system moving on a helical trajectory defined by the set @xmath9 ^{t}|\\,\\beta",

    "[ definition1 ] let @xmath13 , @xmath14 be such that @xmath15 .",
    "the line @xmath16 is commonly referred to as a _ pi - line_. when one restricts @xmath17 one gets a pi - section ( see figure [ fig : helix ] ) .    with definition [ definition1 ] we can quote an interesting geometrical property @xcite :    [ theorem1](helix property ) consider the helix trajectory as defined in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "then every point @xmath18 confined within the helix has a unique pi - line passing through it .",
    "an immediate consequence of theorem [ theorem1 ] is the following coordinate transform : @xmath19 , \\label{eq : coordinate transformation } \\\\ \\nonumber y & = r[(1-t)\\sin { \\beta_{1}}+t\\sin { \\beta_{2 } } ]   ,   \\\\",

    "the data collected is the set of all projections of rays going through the scanned body .",
    "specifically , a projection is the integral along a ray emanating from the source at position @xmath21 , passing through the scanned object @xmath4 and hitting the sensors array at the coordinates @xmath22 ^{t}$ ] .",
    "the aim of a reconstruction algorithm is to reconstruct @xmath4 from its projections , namely , the measured data .",
    "the ( continuous ) projection data is given by@xmath23 where by @xmath24 we denote all the points on the line ( ray ) connecting @xmath21 to @xmath25 ^{t}$ ] on the sensor array .",
    "before we conclude this section , we wish to point out that there are a number of perfect reconstruction algorithms using the data @xmath26 . that is to say that one can reconstruct the exact image , @xmath4 , from its helical cone beam projections .",
    "good examples are found in @xcite which are of the filtered back - projection type and have computational advantages .",
    "these algorithms use the helix property to reconstruct each pi - section independently using data corresponding to @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "while perfect reconstruction of @xmath28 from @xmath29 is theoretically possible , in practice , one can only collect a sampled version of @xmath30 .",
    "the commonly used sampling is uniform in @xmath31 and to avoid aliasing it needs to be sufficiently dense ( in the sense of nyquist rate ) .",
    "this , however , as pointed out earlier , results in patient exposureto high amounts of radiation and in very large amounts of data which needs to be stored and processed . to alleviate some of these problems",
    ", we will investigate the frequency content of @xmath32 , and adapt the sampling pattern to its support .",
    "strictly speaking , there are no band - limited functions of finite spatial support .",
    "thus , we use the term essential support and work with functions that have a finite essential support in the frequency domain .",
    "[ definition2]given the function @xmath33 @xmath34 , its essential support is given by a set @xmath35 such that @xmath36    since the function we consider is @xmath30 and it is periodic in @xmath37 , its fourier transform will have the form@xmath38where@xmath39substituting ( [ 5 ] ) , we get@xmath40    we start by observing from figure [ fig : helix ] that @xmath41 so , we can rewrite ( [ 8 ] ) as@xmath42    our goal will now be to find @xmath43 and then find the minimal set @xmath44 such that @xmath45\\thinspace : \\thinspace x^{2}+y^{2}\\leq \\rho\\thinspace , \\thinspace \\vert z\\vert \\leq z\\right\\}. \\label{9a}\\ ] ] clearly , by ( [ 6a ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) , @xmath46 . using properties of delta functions and ( [ 9 ] ) ,",

    "we would like to conclude our paper with an idea which could suggest efficient sampling patterns for generalized hcb ct systems .",
    "as pointed out earlier in the paper , the rotation of source / sensor array around the bed and the travel of the bed can be perceived as a helical trajectory of the cone beam source on a cylindrical surface . by viewing the position of the cone beam source as a point on a cylindrical surface of radius @xmath109 with angle @xmath132 and height @xmath133 ,",
