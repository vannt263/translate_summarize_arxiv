    "it is widely appreciated that , although completely integrable systems may successfully capture many important features of nonlinear dispersive wave propagation , they may fail to provide an adequate description of large amplitude waves .",
    "consequently , significant efforts have recently been directed towards the derivation and analysis of relatively simple models , enabling the quantitative description of the propagation of fully nonlinear waves .",
    "although such `` intermediate '' models are typically not integrable using an inverse scattering transform ( ist ) , they often provide the possibility of obtaining important particular solutions , as well as having other advantages compared to the full physical system from the viewpoint of numerical simulations .",
    "one such system , the so - called green - naghdi ( gn ) equations , describes large - amplitude shallow water waves @xcite and also appears in a number of other fluid dynamics contexts , such as `` continua with memory '' @xcite , solar magnetohydrodynamics @xcite , bubbly fluid flows @xcite and the dynamics of short capillary - gravity waves @xcite .",
    "the two - layer versions of the gn system @xcite provide a broad field for the modelling of large amplitude interfacial waves .",
    "it should be noted that the one - dimensional version of the gn system , which is the main subject of this paper , was originally derived by su and gardner @xcite using a long - wave asymptotic expansion of the full euler equations for irrotational flow ( see also el , grimshaw & smyth @xcite ) , while the original 2d gn system was derived using the `` directed fluid sheets '' theory , which does not require a formal asymptotic expansion , but instead imposes the condition that the vertical velocity has only a linear dependence on the vertical @xmath0 coordinate , and simultaneously assumes that the horizontal velocity is independent of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we shall use the term sg system which appears historically more correct , at least for one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "the sg system has the form @xmath1_x \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in the context of shallow - water waves , @xmath2 is the total depth and @xmath3 is the layer - mean horizontal velocity ; all variables are non - dimensionalised by their typical values .",
    "the first equation is the exact equation for conservation of mass and the second equation can be regarded as an approximation to the equation for conservation of horizontal momentum .",
    "the system ( [ gn ] ) has the typical structure of the well - known boussinesq - type systems for shallow water waves , but differs from them in retaining full nonlinearity in the leading - order dispersive term on the right - hand side of ( [ gn ] ) .",
    "we stress that there is no limitation on the amplitude assumed in the derivation of ( [ gn ] ) .",
    "this , along with the appearance of this system in different physical contexts , suggests that equations ( [ gn ] ) represent an important mathematical model for understanding general properties of fully nonlinear fluid flows beyond the strict shallow - water limit .",
    "for this reason , it is instructive to study its solutions for the full range of amplitudes , although in the particular context of shallow - water waves the system ( [ gn ] ) , as for any layer - mean model , is unable to reproduce the effects of wave overturning and becomes nonphysical for amplitudes greater than some critical value .",
    "the system ( [ gn ] ) has a solitary wave solution of the form @xmath4 where the solitary wave speed @xmath5 is connected to the amplitude @xmath6 by the relationship @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the background flow parameters .",
    "we note that formula ( [ cs ] ) appears in rayleigh @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic reduction of the sg system ( [ gn ] ) for weakly nonlinear waves is obtained by using the standard scaling @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a small parameter and @xmath15 is the linear longwave speed . for uni - directional propagation",
    ", this leads to the kdv equation ( see , for instance , johnson @xcite ) @xmath16 with the further scaling @xmath17 , ( [ kdv ] ) reduces to the standard kdv form @xmath18 on omitting the primes .",
    "then if one considers sufficiently rapidly decaying positive initial data for ( [ kdv1 ] ) @xmath19 the solution asymptotically consists of a finite number of solitons plus dispersive radiation .",
    "the associated linear spectral problem for ( [ kdv1 ] ) is given by the schrdinger equation @xmath20 note that this is in non - standard form due to the factor @xmath21 in the first term .",
    "then the parameters of the solitons and the radiation are found from the ist using the initial condition @xmath22 ( [ ic1 ] ) for @xmath23 in ( [ spectral ] ) .",
    "in particular , a soliton with amplitude @xmath24 corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath25 of the schrdinger operator .    if one considers a _ large - scale _",
    "initial distribution such that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the typical width of @xmath29 , then the contribution of the radiation is exponentially small in @xmath30 and as @xmath31 the asymptotic outcome consists only of a large ( @xmath32 ) number of solitons , whose amplitudes can be found from the bohr - sommerfeld semi - classical quantization rule , @xmath33 here the integral is taken between the turning points @xmath34 defined as the roots of the equation @xmath35 .",
    "for every given @xmath36 formula ( [ bs ] ) yields a bound state @xmath37 ; @xmath38 with @xmath39 the total number of bound states in the potential @xmath29 . in the kdv context the distribution ( [ bs ] ) , through @xmath40 , gives the amplitude of the @xmath36-th soliton in the soliton train as @xmath41 . for the largest amplitude soliton we have the classical result @xmath42 on the other hand , for a given @xmath43 $ ]",
    ", the formula ( [ bs ] ) determines the total number of bound states @xmath36 in the spectral interval @xmath44 as @xmath45 here `` @xmath46 '' denotes the integer part .    for large @xmath36 the bound states",
    "are located close to each other and we can introduce a continuous amplitude function @xmath47 . then differentiating ( [ bs ] ) with respect to @xmath6 , one obtains the distribution function for soliton amplitudes in the train @xmath48 so that @xmath49 yields the number of solitons having amplitudes in the interval @xmath50 .",
    "the total number of solitons in the soliton train is estimated by setting @xmath51 in ( [ bs ] ) ( alternatively , one can integrate @xmath52 from @xmath53 to @xmath54 ) @xmath55 the distribution ( [ karp ] ) was originally introduced into soliton theory by karpman @xcite ( see also whitham @xcite and karpman @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , distributions of this type have been obtained , also from the associated linear spectral problem , for the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite and for the kaup - boussinesq system @xcite .",
    "one can see that integrability of the kdv equation plays a crucial role in the derivation of the formulae ( [ bs])([n1 ] ) through the eigenvalue problem for the associated linear schrdinger equation ( [ spectral ] ) . at the same time",
    "one can observe that the formulae obtained correspond to the semi - classical approximation and that this very approximation can be applied directly to the kdv equation , by - passing the ist formalism .",
    "it is well - known ( see lax and levermore @xcite ) that the semi - classical limit of the kdv equation with decaying initial data leads to the whitham modulation system , which can be derived by a direct averaging of the kdv conservation laws over nonlinear wavepackets @xcite or from a multiple - scale perturbation analysis @xcite .",
    "therefore one could expect that the results ( [ amax])([n1 ] ) could be obtained within the framework of the modulation theory alone .",
    "indeed , it was shown in gurevich _",
    "et al _ @xcite and el & grimshaw @xcite that the long - time asymptotics of exact solutions to the kdv - whitham equations with decaying initial data agrees , to first order in @xmath56 , with karpman s formula ( [ karp ] ) .",
    "still , modulation solutions in the cited papers rely on the integrability of the kdv equation as they employ the presence of riemann invariants for the associated whitham system @xcite , and this latter property is due to the unique finite - gap spectral structure of periodic ( or , more - generally , quasi - periodic ) solutions of the kdv equation @xcite .",
    "an important theme in the original work of whitham @xcite is that , unlike the ist , the nonlinear modulation approach can be applied to nonintegrable dispersive systems provided a minimal structure is present , that is the existence of periodic solutions characterised by a certain number of parameters , and the availability of a limited number of conservation laws .",
    "the resulting modulation system consists of hydrodynamic - type equations and is hyperbolic in many cases , which implies that it can be treated using classical methods of characteristics theory ( see , for instance , courant & hilbert @xcite ) .",
    "this opens the possibility of obtaining some analytical results for non - integrable dispersive wave systems in the framework of modulation theory .",
    "indeed , it was recently shown in el @xcite that the availability of a number of important exact results for the single - phase modulation theory is , in fact , due to certain very general properties of modulation systems and is not connected with the presence of the riemann invariant structure .",
    "these properties have been used in el , grimshaw & smyth @xcite to derive the main parameters of large - amplitude shallow - water undular bores evolving from an initial step for the sg system ( [ gn ] ) . in the present paper",
    ", we extend the modulation analysis of el @xcite and el , grimshaw & smyth @xcite to obtain an analogue of karpman s formula ( [ karp ] ) and its consequences ( [ amax ] ) and ( [ n1 ] ) for the sg system for an initial disturbance in depth and velocity that decays at infinity .",
    "our approach is based on an assumption , confirmed by numerical solutions , that the main qualitative features of the kdv evolution of large - scale disturbances , such as the formation of a single - phase undular bore and its further evolution into a solitary wave train with a negligibly small contribution of the linear radiation , remain present in the sg model .",
    "our analytical results will be supported by comparison with full numerical solutions of the sg system .",
    "it is instructive to start with a demonstration of our general approach to an asymptotic description of solitary wave trains by using the kdv equation as a `` test '' example .",
    "our ultimate goal here is to derive karpman s formula ( [ karp ] ) without invoking the integrability properties of the kdv equation and its modulation system .",
    "this derivation will then serve as a prototype for calculations for the sg system , which is genuinely non - integrable .",
    "we consider the initial - value problem ( [ kdv1 ] ) and ( [ ic1 ] ) . without being too restrictive",
    ", we also assume that @xmath57 for @xmath58 , which will simplify the following analysis .",
    "as before , we consider a large - scale initial disturbance , so that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath28 is the characteristic width of the initial hump .",
    "the wave evolution from ( [ kdv1 ] ) and ( [ ic1 ] ) leads to wave breaking at some @xmath61 , which can be taken to be @xmath62 without loss of generality , which is then resolved by an undular bore ( which is also often called a dispersive shock wave ) , which is an expanding nonlinear modulated wave train with a distinctive spatial structure . near the leading edge of the undular",
    "bore the oscillations appear to be close to successive solitary waves , while in the vicinity of the trailing edge they are nearly linear .",
    "an asymptotic similarity modulation solution for the undular bore evolving from an initial distribution in the form of a sharp step was first obtained by gurevich and pitaevskii ( gp ) @xcite using the whitham method of averaging over periodic nonlinear wavetrains @xcite and then rigorously recovered in the framework of the semiclassical ist formalism by lax , levermore and venakides ( see their review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in contrast to the lax - levermore - venakides global construction , the direct modulation approach of gp does not rely on the ist and thus has the advantage of potential applicability to non - integrable systems .",
    "this advantage was realised in el @xcite for the simplest class of problems with step - like initial conditions where the modulation solution for the undular bore represents an expansion fan , similar to the gp solution .    for the case of positive initial data , which decay at infinity , the whole initial disturbance decomposes , at very large times @xmath63 , into a chain of solitons with a certain amplitude distribution .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , the semi - classical ist approach leads to karpman s formula ( [ karp ] ) for this distribution . however , it transpired that the same result can be obtained using the derivation of the intermediate modulation solution for the undular bore and then considering its long - time asymptotic behaviour @xcite . in this connection",
    "it should be mentioned that the modulation dynamics in these problems with decaying initial data is not self - similar , so the original gurevich - pitaevskii @xcite theory required significant development in order to be applied to such problems .",
    "it transpires that further development is required to extend modulation analysis to non - integrable systems with decaying initial data . below",
    "we present the gp formulation for the kdv equation in a form convenient for further generalistion to non - integrable systems .",
    "the local waveform of the undular bore is described by the single - phase periodic solution of the kdv equation travelling with constant velocity @xmath5 , that is @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "this solution is specified by the ordinary differential equation @xmath66 @xmath67 being constants of integration .",
    "the phase velocity @xmath5 , the amplitude @xmath6 , the wavenumber @xmath68 and the mean @xmath69 are expressed in terms of the polynomial roots @xmath70 as @xmath71 while the wave frequency is @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath73 the solution of ( [ tr ] ) turns into small amplitude harmonic waves with the dispersion relation @xmath74 in an opposite extreme , when @xmath75 , the travelling wave @xmath76 transforms into a soliton with its velocity depending on the amplitude as @xmath77 if one allows slow dependence of @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 or , equivalently , @xmath69 , @xmath68 , and @xmath6 on @xmath81 and @xmath82 , one arrives at the modulation system which can be derived by averaging two of the kdv conservation laws over the periodic wave family ( [ tr ] ) @xmath83 and then closing ( [ wh2 ] ) with the equation for `` conservation of waves '' ( see whitham @xcite ) @xmath84 we note that the detailed expressions for the averages in ( [ wh2 ] ) will not be needed . to describe the evolution of modulations in an undular bore the system ( [ wh2 ] ) and ( [ wc ] )",
    "must be equipped with matching conditions ensuring continuity of the mean @xmath85 at the undular bore edges @xmath86 @xcite @xmath87 here @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the solution of the hopf equation @xmath90 which represents the dispersionless limit of the kdv equation ( [ kdv ] ) and is valid outside the oscillatory region . as we have assumed that @xmath91 for @xmath58",
    ", we have @xmath92 .    the trailing @xmath93 and the leading @xmath94 edges of the undular bore represent free boundaries defined by the kinematic conditions @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the group velocity of linear waves and @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "it is important to note that , according to general properties of quasi - linear hyperbolic systems ( see , for instance , courant & hilbert @xcite ) , the curves @xmath86 , being the lines which match two analytically different solutions , must coincide with characteristics of the modulation system ( [ wh2 ] ) and ( [ wc ] ) . indeed , as we shall see , the kinematic conditions ( [ kin ] ) and the requirement that the undular bore boundaries must be characteristics of the modulation system are equivalent .",
    "we now consider the modulation equations in two distinguished limits : as @xmath73 and as @xmath75 corresponding to the wave regimes at the trailing and the leading edges of the undular bore respectively .",
    "when @xmath73 the oscillations do not contribute to the averaging , so @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is an arbitrary function , and the modulation system must reduce to ( see el @xcite for details ) @xmath101 the system ( [ red1 ] ) has two families of characteristics , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the first family is consistent with the characteristics of the `` external '' hopf equation ( [ hopf ] ) which transfers initial data from the @xmath81 axis into the undular bore region in the @xmath104-plane , while one of the characteristics of the second family specifies the trailing edge of the undular bore ( see the first kinematic condition ( [ kin ] ) ) .",
    "then , according to the general properties for the prescription of cauchy data on characteristics ( see , for instance , whitham @xcite ) , one can not specify the values of @xmath69 and @xmath68 at the trailing edge independently .",
    "of course , a similar statement is true for the leading edge as well , and this is why the matching conditions ( [ gp ] ) are sufficient to determine the evolution of an undular bore regardless of the fact that they involve less variables than the modulation system ( [ wh2 ] ) .",
    "the admissible combinations of the values of @xmath69 and @xmath68 on a characteristic with @xmath105 are found by a substitution of @xmath106 into ( [ red1 ] ) , which leads to the ordinary differential equation @xmath107 substituting the linear dispersion relation ( [ dr0 ] ) into ( [ ode1 ] ) one readily obtains the characteristic integral @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "we now consider the soliton limit @xmath75 . here",
    "the wavelength @xmath110 tends to infinity , so that the contribution of oscillations to the mean value @xmath69 vanishes , and , similarly to the case of vanishing amplitude , we have @xmath111 .",
    "hence , we arrive , again , at the hopf equation for @xmath69 , @xmath112 we finally pass to the limit as @xmath75 in the wave conservation law ( [ wc ] ) .",
    "this limiting transition , unlike that as @xmath73 , is a singular one , so that it requires a more careful treatment .",
    "firstly we note that the wave conservation law is satisfied identically for @xmath113 , so we need to take into account higher order terms in the expansion of ( [ wc ] ) for small @xmath68 .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce a `` conjugate wave number '' ( cf.([l ] ) ) @xmath114 instead of the amplitude @xmath6 and the ratio @xmath115 instead of the original wave number @xmath68 , so that the parameters @xmath116 form a new set of modulation variables which is more convenient for the consideration of the vicinity of the soliton edge of an undular bore than our original set @xmath117 .",
    "the variable @xmath118 can be considered as the wavenumber of a `` conjugate travelling wave '' specified by the equation @xmath119\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) and @xmath121 is a new phase variable characterised by the same phase velocity @xmath5 .",
    "equation ( [ conjtrav ] ) specifies periodic solutions of the `` conjugate '' kdv equation @xmath122 which can be obtained from ( [ kdv1 ] ) by the change of variables @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "it is not difficult to infer from ( [ conjk ] ) and ( [ conjtrav ] ) that in the limit @xmath125 ( i.e.  @xmath75 ) @xmath126 has the meaning of an inverse soliton width ( or `` soliton wavenumber '' ) defined by the asymptotic behaviour in the soliton tails @xmath127 as @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , it follows from ( [ conjtrav ] ) that the dependence of the soliton speed , which coincides with the value of the phase velocity @xmath5 evaluated in the limit as @xmath125 on its inverse width ( and , therefore , from ( [ ca ] ) , on the amplitude @xmath6 ) , follows from the conjugate linear dispersion relation @xmath129 .",
    "the latter is obtained from the linear dispersion relation ( [ dr0 ] ) by the change of variables @xmath130 and @xmath131 , i.e.  @xmath132 .",
    "we thus have @xmath133 and , comparing with ( [ ca ] ) , we obtain the well known relationship between the kdv soliton amplitude and its inverse width @xmath134 we are now ready to study the asymptotic expansion of the wave conservation law for @xmath135",
    ". first we substitute @xmath136 into eq .",
    "( [ wc ] ) to obtain the equivalent representation @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "next we consider eq .",
    "( [ wc1 ] ) for small @xmath139 and assume that @xmath140 for the solutions of interest .",
    "we note that this is known to be the case for modulation solutions describing undular bores in weakly dispersive systems , where at the soliton edge one has @xmath75 , but @xmath141 ( see el @xcite for a general discussion of this behaviour and gurevich and pitaevskii @xcite for the detailed calculations in the kdv case ) . then to leading order we obtain the characteristic equation @xmath142 or @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a constant .",
    "in particular , when @xmath145 ( that is @xmath146 ) , the characteristic ( [ c2 ] ) specifies the leading edge of the undular bore ( cf .",
    "( [ kin ] ) ) .",
    "now , considering a restriction of equation ( [ wc1 ] ) to the characteristic family @xmath147 and using that @xmath148 to leading order , we obtain @xmath149 we note that the equation @xmath150 arises as a `` soliton wavenumber '' conservation law in the traditional perturbation theory for a single soliton ( see , for instance , grimshaw @xcite ) , but to be consistent with full modulation theory it should be considered along the soliton path @xmath151 .",
    "since @xmath69 and @xmath126 can not be specified independently on a characteristic , there should exist a local relationship @xmath152 consistent with the system ( [ hopf ] ) and ( [ cws ] ) .",
    "substituting @xmath153 into ( [ cws ] ) and using ( [ hopf ] ) we obtain an equation for @xmath126 similar to equation ( [ ode1 ] ) for @xmath68 obtained earlier in the opposite limit as @xmath73 @xmath154 substituting @xmath155 ( [ conjomega ] ) into ( [ ode2 ] ) one readily integrates to obtain @xmath156 where @xmath157 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "now we use the fact that the linear wave packet at the trailing edge and the lead solitary wave are not independent , but rather are constrained by the condition of being parts of the same undular bore .",
    "so , if one considers a pair of integrals ( [ ku ] ) and ( [ kappau ] ) with certain constants @xmath109 and @xmath157 in the context of the _ same _ modulation solution , then @xmath109 and @xmath157 can not be set independently .",
    "one can see from ( [ ku ] ) that if @xmath158 , then @xmath113 , which then must be consistent with equation ( [ kappau ] ) derived for the soliton configuration .",
    "but , at the same time , equation ( [ ku ] ) corresponds to @xmath105 , which , together with @xmath113 , implies @xmath159 ( see ( [ ak ] ) ) .",
    "so setting @xmath160 in ( [ kappau ] ) immediately yields @xmath161 and we therefore arrive at the set of two consistent characteristic integrals of the modulation system @xmath162 @xmath163 one should add that both @xmath68 and @xmath126 are required to be real , so the integrals @xmath164 involve different parts of the domain of the function @xmath165 .",
    "we start with the determination of the total number of solitons generated by the decay of the given initial disturbance ( [ kdv1 ] ) and then proceed by obtaining a more detailed description of a soliton train by finding the distribution function for the soliton amplitudes in terms of the initial data .",
    "we consider the wave conservation law ( [ wc ] ) .",
    "for the case of the decaying initial profile ( [ kdv1 ] ) one obviously has @xmath166 as @xmath167 for all @xmath82 , and hence equation ( [ wc ] ) implies conservation of the total number of oscillations ( wave crests ) @xmath168 we use an approximate equality sign here due to the inherent asymptotic character of modulation theory .",
    "next we note that , qualitatively , the process of soliton generation during the evolution of the large - scale , decaying initial profile ( [ ic1 ] ) can be described as follows ( see gurevich , krylov & mazur @xcite for a quantitative justification ) : each wave crest is generated at the trailing edge as a vanishingly small amplitude linear wave and asymptotically , as @xmath41 , transforms into a soliton .",
    "formula ( [ n2 ] ) then can be used for the evaluation of the total number of solitons in the eventual soliton train .    to evaluate the integral in ( [ n2 ] )",
    "one needs to know the function @xmath169 for all @xmath81 at any particular @xmath82 , say at @xmath170 .",
    "the difficulty with the traditional gurevich - pitaevskii approach to the undular bore description is that the wave number @xmath68 in this approach is defined only within the undular bore region @xmath171 $ ] .",
    "however , one can extend the notion of the wavenumber to the entire @xmath81-axis by defining the function @xmath169 in such a way that its behaviour outside the undular bore region is consistent with the prescribed values of @xmath68 along the leading and trailing edges @xmath86 for all @xmath82 .    at the leading edge @xmath172",
    "we have @xmath113 for all @xmath82 . therefore we define @xmath173 for @xmath174 .",
    "hence here we have @xmath175 at the trailing edge @xmath176 the amplitude of the wave @xmath105 , and since the trailing edge represents a characteristic of the modulation system , the value of the wavenumber @xmath177 is determined by the boundary value of @xmath178 from the characteristic integral @xmath179 in ( [ int1 ] ) for a certain @xmath180 ( see ( [ gp ] ) and ( [ hopf ] ) for the definitions of @xmath181 ) . to be consistent with the matching conditions ( [ gp ] ) , we need to set @xmath182 . indeed since at the leading edge @xmath183 ,",
    "then the dependence @xmath184 must correctly reproduce the value @xmath113 for the case when @xmath185 , implying @xmath105 and @xmath113 simultaneously , which by ( [ ak ] ) also implies @xmath159 .",
    "so we obtain @xmath186 now upstream of the undular bore , that is @xmath187 , the function @xmath89 satisfies the hopf equation ( [ hopf ] ) with the initial condition @xmath188 , i.e. implicitly @xmath189 .",
    "therefore for @xmath190 we need to define the wavenumber as @xmath191 , where @xmath89 is the aforementioned simple - wave solution .",
    "this extension basically implies that we assume that upstream of the undular bore , where @xmath105 , the relationship ( [ int1 ] ) holds _ everywhere _ ( not only for a special family of characteristics @xmath192 ) .",
    "indeed it can be readily seen that @xmath193 is a solution of the reduced modulation system ( [ red1 ] ) regardless of the particular characteristic family .",
    "thus at @xmath170 we obtain @xmath194 we note that since @xmath195 this formula is also consistent with our definition ( [ k01 ] ) for @xmath196 for @xmath197 , so that ( [ k02 ] ) gives the function @xmath198 on the entire real line . now substituting ( [ k02 ] ) into ( [ n2 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath199 which agrees with the ist result ( [ n1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the formula ( [ n3 ] ) in fact represents a particular case of a more general expression , which is obtained by retaining the parameter @xmath180 in the modulation integral @xmath179 ( [ int1 ] ) so that instead of @xmath200 in ( [ n3 ] ) one introduces @xmath201\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\hbox{and } \\quad k_0(x,{\\lambda } ) & = &   0 \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad",

    "thus we arrive at the continuous family of quantities characterised by the parameter @xmath204 $ ] @xmath205    -section of the initial profile ( below ) and the behaviour of the corresponding confining characteristics for part of the kdv modulation solution ( above ) .",
    "@xmath206 is the domain of influence of the interval @xmath207$],width=377 ]    to clarify the meaning of the quantity @xmath208 in the framework of modulation theory we introduce the notion of a @xmath209-section of the initial profile , which is simply a segment of the function @xmath29 for which @xmath210 ( see fig .",

[ fig1 ] ) . note that this @xmath213 plays for the @xmath209-section of the ( evolving ) profile @xmath216 a role similar to the breaking time , as the nonlinear oscillations emerge in the vicinity of the point @xmath217 and the system ( [ red1 ] ) ceases to be valid .",
    "however , unlike at the breaking point , there is no gradient catastrophe at @xmath218 .",
    "we now see that for @xmath212 one has @xmath219 and thus @xmath220 .",
    "indeed the integrand in ( [ ft ] ) is nothing but the exact solution ( [ ku ] ) of the modulation system ( [ red1 ] ) .",

    "indeed , it was shown in el , grimshaw and smyth @xcite that starting from some critical depth jump @xmath339 across the sg undular bore , the oscillatory structure of the bore qualitatively changes due to linear degeneration of the characteristic field and formation of a rapidly varying , finite amplitude rear wavefront , as opposed to the usual vanishing amplitude trailing wave packet assumed in the gp formulation . as an estimate we can assume @xmath340 , the value of an `` effective jump '' taken at the level of half the maximum value of the depth disturbance .",

    "the sg system is not integrable by the ist , but has enough structure ( a periodic travelling wave solution family and four conservation laws ) to be amenable to a nonlinear modulation analysis .",
    "it also transpires that the sg system represents an important mathematical model for understanding general properties of fully nonlinear fluid flows beyond the strict shallow water limit . for this reason we have studied its solutions for the full range of amplitudes , although in the particular context of shallow water waves the system ( [ gn ] ) is unable to reproduce the effects of wave overturning and becomes nonphysical for amplitudes greater than some critical value .",
    "the resulting asymptotic formulae for the solitary wave amplitude distribution function , the total number of solitary waves and the amplitude of the leading solitary wave in the solitary wavetrain formed as the long time outcome of the decay of an initial large scale , one hump depth disturbance have been compared with the results of direct numerical simulations of the su - gardner system .",
    "very good agreement between the modulation solution and numerical results have been demonstrated , even for the range of initial amplitudes significantly exceeding that for the applicability of modulation theory due to formation of a rapidly varying wavefront at the trailing edge of the undular bore at an intermediate stage of its evolution ( see el , grimshaw and smyth @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained for fully nonlinear shallow water theory have also been compared with their weakly nonlinear counterparts which are well known from the semi - classical ist approach to the kdv equation , where they were obtained as consequences of the famous bohr - sommerfeld quantisation rule ( see whitham @xcite and karpman @xcite ) .",
    "overall , one can conclude that kdv theory gives a very good prediction for the lead solitary wave amplitude and the spatial density of solitary waves in the fully nonlinear solitary wavetrain , but consistently over - predicts the number of solitary waves in a given amplitude interval .",

    "one can also note that this comparison is consistent with the modulation results for sg undular bores in the step resolution problem studied in el , grimshaw and smyth @xcite , where it was shown that the sg undular bore is noticeably narrower and contains less wavecrests than its kdv counterpart for moderate to large values of the depth jump across the bore . also , due to the essentially different amplitude - speed relationships for sg and kdv solitary waves ( cf .",
