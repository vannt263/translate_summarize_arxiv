    "a phase transformation in a liquid phase can be affected when it is subject to high intensity acoustic waves .",
    "the rarefaction pressure swing of the wave can nucleate bubbles or induce a liquid - gas transition , @xcite called acoustic cavitation .",
    "several theoretical and experimental studies have shown that wave propagation in melts and supercooled liquids causes periodic phase transformation resulting in enhanced crystallisation .",
    "@xcite for instance , liquid helium exposed to a high intensity focused ultrasound field undergoes liquid - solid transformation .",
    "@xcite nucleation of solid helium was observed to happen over the compression cycle followed by a decay and finally melting during the rarefaction cycle .",
    "likewise , there is a body of works , mainly experimental , reporting the effect of an ultrasound field on crystallisation in a supersaturated solution .",
    "@xcite the latter is usually referred as the sonocrystallisation process .",
    "depending on the acoustic pressure magnitude and frequency , sonocrystallisation can yield a high nucleation rate and produce much finer crystals with a narrower crystal size distribution ( csd ) compared to the conventional ( silent ) cooling crystallisation .",
    "@xcite    the mechanism by which ultrasound affects nucleation in a supersaturated solution is uncertain but it has been mainly attributed to the cavitation phenomenon .",
    "@xcite enhancement in nucleation rate was , however , experimentally observed @xcite in an ultrasound field that is weak enough to inhibit cavitation .",
    "two main types of ultrasound - induced cavitation are inertial and stable cavitation .",
    "inertial cavitation is the event when tiny cavities or dissolved gases in the liquid grow rapidly due to the rarefaction created by the ultrasound wave and collapse violently in the compression cycle of the ultrasound wave .",
    "this collapse generates enormous shock waves travelling with a speed of about @xmath0 and a magnitude of up to @xmath1 as well as a temperature rise at the centre of the bubble to about @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite this can also lead to a significant temperature variation at a rate of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite all these effects happen locally and over a very short period of time , i.e. spatially and temporally on scales of the volume of a bubble and nano - seconds respectively .",
    "@xcite in the case of an asymmetric collapse , e.g. due to an oscillation and implosion of a bubble in the vicinity of a solid surface , a jet of fluid , at speeds greater than @xmath4 , is generated which can also influence the crystallisation process .",
    "@xcite both the direct acoustic field and the indirect effects associated with cavitation influence the thermodynamics and kinetics of nucleation .    considering the effect of static pressure on nucleation ,",
    "ford @xcite modelled the pressure dependent homogeneous nucleation in a gas mixture using a statistical mechanics approach .",
    "within the framework of classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) , kashchiev et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a model estimating the pressure dependent nucleation rate of condensed phase in a solution .",
    "this model does not consider the effect of pressure on the excess free energy as it was based on a cluster boundary defined by the equimolar dividing surface ( eds ) .",
    "with regard to modelling the effect of acoustic cavitation on crystallisation or solidification , the influence of radiated pressure from a collapsing bubble on the thermodynamics of ice formation was studied by saclier et al .",
    "@xcite louisnard et al .",
    "@xcite , however , proposed a segregation hypothesis where mass transportation due to the emitted shock wave from an inertial cavitation is the main factor leading to high nucleation rates observed experimentally .",
    "they suggested the mass diffusion mechanism and its effect on the kinetics of nucleation as the key factor rather than the effect of pressure oscillation on the thermodynamic state . here",
    "we show that this may only be the case if a cluster is defined by an eds .",
    "nevertheless , pressure fluctuation affects both the nucleation work and kinetics simultaneously .    if we model the kinetics of nucleation with the cluster dynamics approach , i.e. the master equation , @xcite it is determined by means of aggregative and non - aggregative mechanisms .",
    "aggregative mechanisms include nucleation , growth and ageing , that give rise to the flux of cluster concentration along the size axis @xmath5 .",
    "the non - aggregative mechanism accounts for change in composition ( concentration of clusters ) driven by mass flux along the space parameter axis .",
    "these two fluxes together determine the cluster distribution over time .",
    "we show that an acoustic wave can affect both processes which creates a coupled problem .",
    "however , depending on the magnitude and wavelength of the pressure fluctuation , the non - aggregative process , i.e. mass flux due to pressure gradient across space between adjacent systems within the bath , might be negligible .",
    "@xcite this work aims to investigate the effect of pressure fluctuation on aggregative mechanism in particular .",
    "this allows us to study the effect of pressure variation on nucleation , the early stage of growth and also the ostwald - ripening phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , focusing on the aggregative mechanism we only need to know the local pressure fluctuation in the region of interest , i.e. dynamic pressure in the system , which can be emitted from any type of acoustic source , e.g. a planar or focused transducer or radiated pressure from either stable or inertial cavitation .",
    "nevertheless , the development accounts for the effects associated with the wave propagation including temperature change , e.g. due to absorption , too .",
    "this makes it possible to apply this formulation to investigate the effect of pressure fluctuation in the old phase , emitted from any acoustic source , on the thermodynamics and kinetics of a first order phase change .",
    "accounting for the non - aggregative effect of an acoustic wave and combining it with the present work to resolve the coupled problem is the subject of a forthcoming paper .    to accomplish our objectives",

    "this is particular to this combination of supersaturation and pressure magnitude as we observed a fluctuating supersaturation for the case of eds clusters either at lower initial supersaturation or higher pressure magnitude .",
    "this is explained by the inverse relationship between pressure and supersaturation such that the pressure effect becomes more significant at lower supersaturations @xcite and therefore imposes variation in detachment frequency and supersaturation eventually .",
    "the gibbs formalism is often employed to determine the thermodynamics of a phase transformation .",

    "nevertheless , we have shown that the gibbs model can overcome some of these difficulties associated with the thermodynamics of small clusters if a non - eds is utilised to define a cluster . for a given cluster size , moving a dividing surface essentially modifies the size of the core new phase and its thermodynamics .",
    "furthermore , the specification of the dividing surface influences the excess helmholtz free energy of the interface phase , given by @xmath90 , and consequently the effective surface tension : see eq .",
    "[ eq : gammaeff ] .",
    "the dividing surface is the unphysical element of the model and its corresponding surface tension is defined to make the free energy of the interface phase independent of the location of the dividing surface.@xcite derivations in the paper are valid for any dividing surface , including the eds and surface of tension , and their associated size - dependent surface tension @xmath292 .",
    "computation of the excess free energy of the surface @xmath293 requires the knowledge about the size of interface phase @xmath13 and the surface tension .",
    "equation [ eq : nsigma ] is developed to calculate the size of the core new phase and the interface phase for any location of a dividing surface relative to the conventional eds .",
    "selecting @xmath292 requires a suitable model of the size - dependent surface tension but many of those available models often break down in the limit of small clusters .",
    "this issue becomes more significant in the case of sonocrystallisation process : the critical cluster size ( for a condensed new phase ) decreases as the pressure magnitude increases .",
    "therefore , we defined _ the new surface _ which is identified as follows : i ) this surface is characterised by the size - independent surface tension @xmath113 , and ii ) the surface is positioned such that we obtain a reference excess free surface energy for the clusters .",
    "this was achieved by equating @xmath106 ( obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : gammaeff ] when setting @xmath294 ) to the effective surface tension obtained from statistical mechanical simulations and solving for the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "we showed that even a size - independent @xmath60 and associated non - eds clusters can reasonably well reproduce the excess free energy of different cluster sizes obtained from statistical mechanical simulations and successfully predict the kinetics of water droplet formation .",

    "this is introduced by the term @xmath295 in eq .",
    "[ eq : detachfreq_cont2 ] which is illustrated in figure [ fig : hprime_n ] as well .",
    "in contrast to eds clusters used in the cnt , the effect of pressure on the work of cluster formation and consequently the detachment rate varies with the size of non - eds clusters ( the work and detachment rate can be decreased or increased depending on the sign of @xmath60 ) and tends towards the predictions of the cnt in the limit of large clusters . for an eds cluster",
    "we have @xmath296 and therefore @xmath297 which becomes negligible if the difference in molecular density of the old and new phases is small .",
    "this impairs the effect of pressure on the thermodynamics of phase transformation .",
    "in contrast , a non - eds cluster gives a non - unity @xmath287 , especially for a small cluster size , see figure [ fig : hprime_n ] , and the thermodynamic effect of a pressure variation can be more substantial .",
    "additionally , the size of a condensed critical cluster inversely correlates to the pressure magnitude , see dashed black curves in figures [ fig : zsn_tau_n_pac1mpa]-[fig : zsn_tau_n_pac100mpa ] .",
    "this together with the size - dependence of @xmath287 may explain some sonocrystallisation experimental observations revealing the improvement in a nucleation rate for a scenario with @xmath298 @xcite while the the conventional form of the cnt which uses eds clusters is incapable of doing so .    with regard to the effect of pressure oscillation on a phase transformation , especially when the new phase is condensed and incompressible , pressure fluctuation can in general enhance or diminish the nucleation rate of the new phase by changing the nucleation barrier .",
    "equations [ eq : workdiffcondfinal2 ] and [ eq : nucworkdiff3 ] demonstrate the effect of pressure on the work of non - critical and critical cluster formation , respectively .",
    "we can see that for a denser new phase , pressure elevation reduces the nucleation barrier and consequently favours nucleation kinetics whereas pressure reduction increases the nucleation barrier and consequently lessens the probability of nucleation .",
    "the inverse trend happens for a new phase with @xmath299 .",
    "as a result , the nucleation rate goes up in a half cycle of acoustic waves but diminishes in the other half cycle .",
    "this is due to variation in detachment frequency with pressure oscillation as shown in figure [ fig : govertime_alllam ] for a crystallisation process . in a half cycle",
    ", the detachment frequency is lower than the attachment frequency which leads to cluster growth whereas in the other half cycle detachment frequency becomes larger than attachment frequency which promotes the decay of the cluster .",
    "this leads to a time variable nucleation rate which alters the size distribution of supercritical clusters .",
    "the effect of variation in the static pressure on nucleation kinetics is binary , either enhancement or attenuation , however the acoustic wave produces both effects over a cycle . a precise experiment on the nucleation of solid helium from liquid helium conducted by chavanne et .",
    "@xcite illustrated a similar observation over a cycle of acoustic irradiation by a hemi - spherical focused ultrasound transducer .",
    "the thermodynamics and kinetics of a phase transformation in a closed system exposed to an acoustic field and governed only by the aggregative mechanism has been investigated .",
