    "the getter source is a commercially available dispenser of alkali atoms designed for industrial applications .",
    "the source we use contains a rb compound and a reducing agent enclosed in a stainless steel boat .",
    "the compound is stable at room temperature and the boat can be handled easily without fear of contamination .",
    "when a few a of current is passed through the boat , its temperature rises to several hundred degrees c. at these high temperatures , the rb compound undergoes a reduction reaction and atomic rb is released .",
    "since the reaction is a threshold process , no rb vapor is released below a threshold value of current , typically about 2.7 a.    we have installed the source in our vacuum system by attaching it to a uhv feedthrough using cu - be screw - type connectors .",
    "we have also tried spot welding the source to the feedthrough leads to reduce contact resistance , and find no significant difference in its performance .",
    "we prefer the screw - type connectors since this makes replacement of the source easier .",
    "once inside the vacuum system , it is important to degas the source very well because this limits the ultimate base pressure in the chamber .",
    "we therefore operate the source at a current just below threshold for several hours during the initial bakeout of the system .",
    "when we first start using the source after bakeout , we find that no rb is released even up to a current of 5 a. to get it started , we need to raise the current to about 8 a for a short duration of 25 s. after several such high current pulses , the source becomes very reproducible and has a well defined threshold current of 2.7 a. we speculate that these pulses are essential to get rid of a surface crust that forms during storage and bakeout .    we have probed the rb vapor density inside the vacuum system at different source currents using near - resonant laser light . above the threshold current of 2.7 a",
    ", the fluorescence signal from the vapor increases rapidly with source current . at a current of 4 a",
    ", the vapor becomes optically dense . around 4.5 a , the boat starts to glow red indicating a temperature near 600@xmath7c . above 8 a",
    ", so much rb is released that the walls of the chamber get a metallic coating visible to the naked eye .",
    "we therefore load the mot at source currents in the range of 3.0 to 3.8 a , which gives us an adequate flux of atoms without overloading the vacuum system . the fast turn - off capability of the source is seen in fig .",
    "[ src_decay ] , where we plot the decay of the background fluorescence after the current is turned off .",
    "the @xmath6 time constant is only about 3 s and is independent of source current in the wide range of 3 to 4 a. this indicates that the cooling of the source is very rapid and the time constant is probably limited by the pumping speed near the trapping region .",
    "we find the source to be very robust .",
    "there is no noticeable change in the rb flux at a given current even after a year of regular use .",
    "though the supplier specifies a `` use before '' date of one year from the date of manufacture , we have installed it in our system even after three years without any problems .",
    "contrary to what is reported in ref .",
    "5 , the source does not appear to undergo `` irreversible contamination '' if the pressure rises by several orders of magnitude during initial degassing .",
    "perhaps what they call irreversible contamination is similar to our observation that rb atoms are not released even at currents of 5 a when the source is operated the first few times after bakeout .",
    "but , as mentioned earlier , this can be reversed by applying high current pulses to evaporate any surface layer that might have formed .",
    "the experiments are done in a vacuum chamber consisting of a 100 mm o.d .",
    "stainless steel tube with ten intersecting 38 mm o.d .",
    "ports , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "nine of the ten ports have commercial glass viewports for optical access , and one port holds the feedthrough for the getter source . the source is located about 90 mm from the center of the mot . the chamber is pumped by a 300 @xmath8/s ion pump through a 100 mm o.d . port .",
    "the ion pump has a liquid nitrogen cooled cryo - panel to get better base pressure . under normal conditions ,",
    "the pressure inside the chamber is about @xmath9 torr , which goes down to about @xmath10 torr with the cryo - panel cooled to 77 k.    the mot laser beams are derived from two home - built grating feedback stabilized diode lasers operating at 780 nm .",
    "the first laser is the cooling laser which is locked near the @xmath11 cycling transition in @xmath12rb using saturated absorption spectroscopy in a room temperature vapor cell .",
    "the error signal is obtained by passing the laser beam through an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) and dithering the frequency shift in the aom .",
    "the center frequency of the aom is used to get variable detunings in the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 mhz is the natural linewidth of the transition .",
    "each of the three beams for the mot is circularly polarized with a power of around 4 mw and a @xmath16 radius of 9 mm .",
    "the hyperfine repumping beam is derived from a second stabilized diode laser which is locked to the @xmath17 transition in a vapor cell . the error signal for this laser is obtained by modulating the diode injection current .",
    "the resulting variation of a few mhz in the repumping frequency is inconsequential for operation of the mot .",
    "about 2 mw/@xmath2 of repumping light is mixed with the cooling beams in a polarizing beamsplitter cube .",
    "the six laser beams intersect over a volume of 3 @xmath18 .",
    "a spherical quadrupole magnetic field is superposed on the intersection region using a pair of anti - helmholtz coils ( 10 cm dia , 60 turns each ) placed 10 cm apart .",
    "the field gradient at the center can be varied from 5 to 17 g / cm by varying the current through the coils in the range of 2 to 7 a.    the fluorescence from the trapped cloud of atoms is imaged on to both a ccd camera for viewing , and a calibrated silicon photodiode for quantitative measurements . to estimate the number of trapped atoms",
    "@xmath19 , we fit the total optical power @xmath20 at the photodiode to the following expression : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the solid angle subtended by the detector at the cloud and @xmath23 is the photon scattering rate given by : @xmath24 with @xmath25 the total beam intensity from the six trapping beams , @xmath26 the saturation intensity for the transition ( 1.6 mw/@xmath2 ) , and @xmath27 the detuning .",
    "we have studied the loading characteristics of the mot by measuring the trap fluorescence as a function of time after the laser beams are turned on .",
    "the source is turned on a few minutes before the light beams so that the flux of rb atoms reaches a steady state .",
    "the loading of atoms into the trap is determined by a balance between the capture rate and the loss rate .",
    "this results in the following rate equation : @xmath28 where @xmath19 is the number of atoms in the trap , @xmath29 is the rate at which atoms are captured from the background vapor , and @xmath30 is the loading time constant determined by losses due to collisions @xcite .",
    "the loss rate depends both on collisions with background atoms as well collisions with hot , untrapped rb atoms : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of scattering particles , @xmath33 is the collisional scattering cross section and @xmath34 is the average velocity .",
    "the subscript indicates whether the scattering is from the background ( b ) or from the rb source .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "[ rateeq ] is an exponential growth in the number of trapped atoms : @xmath35\\ ] ] with a steady state value of @xmath36 . since the trap fluorescence is directly related to the number of trapped atoms ( from eq .",
    "[ number ] ) , the photodetector signal after the laser beams are turned on is of the above form .",
    "the trap lifetime @xmath37 after the source is shut off is determined solely by losses due to collisions with non - rb background atoms .",
    "therefore , the photodetector signal after the source is turned off shows an exponential decay with a time constant independent of the steady state population . a typical trap loading and decay curve taken at a source current of 3.8 a",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ loading ] .    to estimate the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq .",
    "[ tau ] , we have studied the trap loading and decay properties at different source currents and two values of background pressure , namely @xmath40 torr and @xmath41 torr . the results are listed in table [ data ] .",
    "several features of the data are to be noted .",
    "first of all , at the higher pressure the loading time @xmath30 is 1 s independent of the source current , indicating that background gas collisions dominate the loss rate .",
    "next , at the lower pressure , @xmath30 goes down from 4.6 s at 3.0 a to 3.3 s at 3.8 a as the flux of atoms from the source increases .",
    "the steady state trap population @xmath42 increases correspondingly from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "finally , the trap lifetime @xmath37 is independent of source current ( and @xmath42 ) at both values of pressure .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the lifetime depends only on background gas collisions .",
    "however , at the higher pressure , one would expect that background collisions would limit the lifetime to a value around 1 s in order to be consistent with the background limited loading time of 1 s , but the measured value is actually 5.5 s. this difference arises because the source has a decay constant of 3 s after turn - off ( see fig .",
    "[ src_decay ] ) and the trap continues to be loaded even after the source is off . at lower pressure , the measured lifetime of the trap is 13.3 s ; here the 3 s decay of the source can be neglected and the turn off can be assumed to be instantaneous .",
    "we use the values of @xmath30 for different pressures at the _ same source current _ to eliminate the effect of the rb term in eq .",
    "[ tau ] and obtain the cross section for background gas collisions from the following expression : @xmath45   \\sigma_{\\rm b } \\bar{v}_{\\rm b}\\ ] ] where the subscripts h and l indicate higher and lower pressure respectively . assuming the background is predominantly nitrogen , which seems reasonable given the considerable drop in pressure when the cryo - panel is cooled to 77 k , we can calculate the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 at room temperature for a given pressure .",
    "the above equation then yields the value of @xmath38 . the average value of @xmath38 obtained from the values of @xmath30 at source currents of 3.0 a and 3.3 a is @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "we can also obtain the value of @xmath38 from the 13.3 s trap lifetime at lower pressure assuming that the loss is solely due to background gas collisions .",
    "this yields a value of @xmath48 @xmath2 , consistent with the above result .",
    "these values are also comparable to the cross section of @xmath49 @xmath2 for na ",
    "n@xmath0 collisions reported in ref .",
    "7 .    using the above value of @xmath38",
    ", we obtain the value of @xmath39 in the following manner .",
    "we first calculate the capture rate @xmath29 by assuming , for simplicity , that all atoms entering the trap volume with a velocity less than a critical velocity @xmath50 are slowed by the laser beams and captured .",
    "if we further assume that the background vapor has a thermal distribution , the number of such atoms per unit time can be calculated from kinetic theory @xcite , which yields : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the surface area of the trapping region determined by the overlap of the laser beams ( 10 @xmath2 in our trap ) . from a one - dimensional laser cooling model , @xmath50 is the velocity at which the doppler shift takes the atom out of resonance by one linewidth , therefore it is given by @xmath53 , about 14 m / s for a typical detuning of @xmath54 . using eq .",
    "[ tau ] for @xmath30 , and eq",
    ".  [ rate ] for @xmath29 , we obtain : @xmath55\\ ] ] which can be used to calculate @xmath39 if @xmath56 is known . assuming a value of 355 m / s for @xmath56 ( corresponding to a temperature of 250@xmath7c ) , we determine a value of @xmath57 @xmath2 for @xmath39 from the data at 3.0 a. this value compares well with the following theoretical estimate for the scattering cross section which assumes that the dominant scattering mechanism is resonant dipole - dipole scattering @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 jm@xmath60 for rb . using @xmath61",
    "m / s for @xmath62 and 355 m / s for @xmath56 yields a value of @xmath63 @xmath2 for @xmath39 . therefore , our assumption that the temperature of the vapor is around 250@xmath7c seems reasonable . at higher currents of 3.3 a and 3.8 a , the measured values of @xmath30 lead to smaller estimates of @xmath39 .",
    "this is probably because nonlinear loss terms @xcite become important at high atom densities and eq .",
    "[ rateeq ] is no longer valid .",
    "it is difficult to extract better estimates of the rb ",
    "rb cross section without a more complete knowledge of the distribution of atoms coming out of the source at different currents .",
    "the velocity distribution of atoms emanating from the source is also important in determining optimal values of detuning and magnetic field gradient for the mot .",
    "this is because the detuning determines the capture velocity , and , as we will see below , the field gradient determines the effective slowing distance .",
    "we have therefore studied the steady state trap population @xmath42 as a function of these parameters . the dependence on detuning",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ ns_det ] .",
    "the number of trapped atoms is maximized at a detuning of @xmath64 for a field gradient of 10 g / cm .",
    "the dependence can be understood from the following physical picture . at low values of detuning ,",
    "the critical velocity @xmath50 for slowing is small , and fewer atoms are captured since @xmath29 varies as @xmath65 ( see eq",
    ".  [ rate ] ) : for example , when @xmath66 , @xmath50 is only 9.5 m / s . at high values of detuning , even though @xmath50 increases , the slowing distance also increases and atoms are not slowed within the 9 mm size of the laser beams .",
    "thus , when @xmath67 , @xmath50 increases to 24 m / s but the slowing distance is about 11 mm .",
    "the optimal value of detuning that we measure is similar to what is observed in a mot loaded from room temperature vapor @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath42 on the magnetic field gradient for a fixed detuning is shown in fig .",
    "[ ns_mag ] .",
    "the trap population is again maximized at an optimum value of field gradient .",
    "the trend can be understood as follows . at low values of the field gradient ,",
    "the trap is shallow and atoms leave the trap easily . at high values of the gradient , the zeeman shift , which increases rapidly away from the trap center , makes laser cooling ineffective because it changes the effective detuning to a smaller value that is less optimal for cooling .",
    "for example , the zeeman shift for @xmath68 transitions driven by circularly polarized light is 1.4 mhz / g .",
    "if the detuning is @xmath69 and the field gradient is 17 g / cm , the atoms become resonant with the laser at a distance of 5 mm from the trap center and atoms are not cooled beyond this point .",
    "the optimal value of field gradient we measure is comparable to values obtained in vapor cell mots @xcite .",
    "the consistency of optimal values of detuning and field gradient with results from vapor cell traps indicate that the velocity distribution emanating from the source is thermal .",
    "we have demonstrated that a mot can be loaded efficiently from a getter source .",
    "the source combines the advantages of providing a large flux of atoms that can be captured by the mot with a fast turn - off necessary for getting a long trap lifetime .",
    "the loading rate is determined both by collisions with background atoms and hot untrapped rb atoms .",
    "we have estimated the cross section for rb  n@xmath0 and rb  rb collisions by measuring the trap properties at two values of background pressure .",
    "the value of @xmath38 is @xmath1 @xmath2 , comparable to a value reported for na  n@xmath0 collisions , and the value of @xmath39 is of order @xmath3 @xmath2 consistent with a theoretical estimate based on resonant dipole - dipole scattering . at a pressure of @xmath4 torr , we load more than @xmath5 atoms into the mot with a time constant of 3.3 s. at a background pressure of @xmath40 torr , the loading time constant is 1 s independent of the source current , indicating that collisions with the background are dominant . we have also measured optimal values of detuning and magnetic field gradient which maximize the trap population .",
    "these values are consistent with observations in vapor cell mots , indicating that the velocity distribution of rb atoms from the source is thermal .",
    "the trap lifetime at a pressure of @xmath70 torr is 13 s and is limited only by the background pressure since the supply of rb atoms stops almost instantaneously .",
    "we are in the process of changing over to a new vacuum system with a ti - sublimation pump that should give us base pressure in the range of @xmath71 torr where we estimate that the trap lifetime will be a few minutes .",
