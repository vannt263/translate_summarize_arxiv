    "the decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons provide unique information on the understanding of low - energy quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , the field theory of strong interaction . since perturbative qcd can not be applied in the low - energy region , because the strong coupling constant @xmath2 is large , other methods like lattice qcd , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) or model - dependent approaches are used .",
    "these can be tested by studying the different decay modes of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "especially , the decays of the @xmath1 can be used to probe the applicability of @xmath3pt ( the @xmath1 mass is of the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale of @xmath4gev ) . moreover",
    ", many models and theories of hadron interaction can be tested .",
    "one can also search for the violation of lepton  family number and place limits on the masses and couplings of many proposed lepto ",
    "quark families , see refs  @xcite .",
    "decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are also suitable to search for violations of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 invariance  @xcite .",
    "the high potential of this field is reflected by the number of experiments that have been or are currently active in @xmath0 and @xmath1 physics . at the mainz microtron ( mami ) with the maximum beam energy of 1604 mev and the crystal ball / taps setup  @xcite , a perfect environment for @xmath0 and @xmath1 studies is given .",
    "the high statistics achievable at mami together with the good signal - to - background conditions makes investigations of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons especially competitive at mami .",
    "other experiments doing research in this field are the kloe experiment at the da@xmath8ne collider , the crystal barrel detector at elsa and wasa at cosy .",
    "also other experiments , like bes iii , clas and gams , are capable of measuring @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , but the capabilities at mami  c have the potential to make mami the leading research laboratory for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , at least for neutral decays .",
    "the electron accelerator mami consists of a cascade of three race - track - microtrons ( rtm )  @xcite .",
    "recently a fourth stage , a harmonic - double - sided microtron ( hdsm )  @xcite , has been finished .",

    "complex three major experiments are installed : the a1 experiment with four high resolution spectrometers for electron scattering measurements , the a2setup with the crystal ball and taps detectors , as well as the a4 high - rate calorimetric detector for the measurement of parity violation in elastic ep  scattering .",
    "the mami accelerator is typically in operation for about 7000 hours per year , which proves the high interest in hadron physics experiments at mami .    within the a2 collaboration ,",
    "experiments are performed with a real photon beam .",
    "the photon beam for the production of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons is derived from the production of bremsstrahlung photons during the passage of the mami electron beam through a thin radiator .",
    "the glasgow photon tagging spectrometer  @xcite at mainz ( fig .",
    "[ pstagger ] ) provides energy tagging of the photons , through @xmath14 , by detecting the post  radiating electron energy .",

    "counter time resolution @xmath15ns  @xcite .",
    "each counter can operate reliably to a rate of @xmath16mhz , corresponding to a photon flux of @xmath17 .",
    "photons can be tagged in the energy range from 5 to 93% of the incoming electron energy @xmath18 .",
    "this means that the highest tagged photon energy , at an electron beam energy of @xmath10mev , is @xmath19mev .        the central detector system , surrounding the liquid hydrogen target ( see fig .",
    "[ pscbtaps ] ) , consists of the crystal ball calorimeter ( cb )  @xcite combined with a barrel of scintillation counters for particle identification .",
    "the cb is a highly segmented 672-element nai(tl ) , self triggering photon spectrometer constructed at slac in the 1970 s .",
    "each element is a 41 cm ( 15.7 radiation lengths ) long truncated triangular pyramid .",
    "they are all read out by individual photomultipliers .",
    "the cb has an energy resolution of @xmath20)^{0.36}$ ] , angular resolutions @xmath21 of @xmath22 and @xmath23 of @xmath24 for electromagnetic showers .",
    "the crystal ball system is equipped with a barrel detector of 24 scintillator strips ( 50 mm length , 4 mm thickness at a radius of 15  cm around the photon beam line ) , which makes particle identification available ( pid ) .     crystals . ]    at forward polar angles @xmath25 the taps detector  @xcite provides acceptance for particle detection .",
    "hence , the full detector system , as shown in fig .  [ pscbtaps ] , is almost hermetic .",
    "the taps forward wall is composed of 384 baf@xmath26 elements , each 25 cm in length ( 12 radiation lengths ) and hexagonal in cross section , with a diameter of 59 mm .",

    "the angular resolution in the polar angle is better than @xmath29 , and in the azimuthal angle it improves with increasing @xmath30 , being always better than 1/r radian , where r is the distance in centimeters from the central point of the taps wall surface to the point on the surface where the particle trajectory meets the detector .",
    "the 2 inner rings of 18 baf@xmath26 elements have recently been replaced by 72 pbwo@xmath31 crystals each 20 cm in length ( 22 radiation lengths ) , see fig .",
    "[ pscbtaps ] .",
    "the higher granularity improves the rate capability as well as the angular resolution .",
    "the energy resolution of pbwo@xmath31 for photons is similar to baf@xmath32 at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "since the installation of the crystal ball at mami in 2003 , several measurements on the @xmath0 have been performed . in the following section [ hdeta ] the determination of the @xmath0 mass , of the dalitz plot parameter @xmath33 , and the branching ratio of @xmath34 are shown . in sect .",
    "[ hdetafut ] future investigations of the @xmath0 meson are described .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 meson has been discussed controversially in recent years . before 2000 ,",
    "three different experiments  @xcite yielded comparable masses of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the pdg then used these results to calculate a weighted mean mass @xmath35mev  @xcite . in 2002 , the na48 collaboration published  @xcite a very precise result , @xmath36mev , which deviated significantly from the world average reported by the pdg .",
    "this created the motivation to repeat the previous mainz measurement at mami  @xcite , especially after another precise measurement by the gem collaboration at the cosy facility  @xcite gave the result @xmath37mev , in agreement with the old measurements of the @xmath0 meson mass .",
    "reaction compared to the measurement made with taps at mami @xcite and the prediction of the @xmath0-maid partial wave analysis  @xcite .",
    "the solid line represents a fit to the results of crystal ball at mami .",
    "the inset shows the linear behavior of @xmath38 near threshold because of the strong coupling to the s@xmath39 resonance . ]",
    "the @xmath0 mass was determined by measuring the threshold of the reaction @xmath40",
    "the tagger microscope  @xcite , a small focal plane detector with a much higher resolution than the main focal plane spectrometer of the tagger , was used for the first time to get the total cross section of the reaction ( see fig .  [ psetamass ] ) .",
    "then the @xmath0 mass was determined from the photoproduction threshold @xmath41 by @xmath42    the preliminary mami result , @xmath43mev , is in agreement with the most recent @xmath0 mass measurements by the na48  @xcite , kloe  @xcite and cleo  @xcite collaborations , though it disagrees with the gem collaboration result  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty for the new @xmath0 mass measurement has been improved in comparison to the previous mainz experiment by a factor of @xmath44@xmath45 , but the two results disagree with each other by two @xmath46 .",
    "as reason for this disagreement a much better tagger energy calibration in the new measurement and the higher resolution of the tagger microscope were found .    at mami two new determinations of the dalitz plot parameter , @xmath33 , of the decay @xmath47 were performed .",
    "the @xmath48 decay violates isospin symmetry .",
    "therefore , it offers a unique possibility to study symmetries and symmetry - breaking characteristics of strong interactions .",
    "because electromagnetic contributions to the amplitude can be neglected @xcite , this decay occurs due to the isospin breaking part of the qcd hamiltonian : @xmath49 hence , the amplitude is proportional to the mass difference @xmath50 of the two lightest quarks u and d. calculations of the decay amplitude are usually based on the framework of @xmath3pt .",
    "thus , this measurement provides also a very important test for @xmath3pt .",
    "the squared absolute value of the decay amplitude may be expanded around the centre of the dalitz plot : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a normalisation constant , which is equal to the amplitude that would apply , if the decay proceeded only according to the available phase space .",
    "the dalitz plot parameter , @xmath33 , describes the pion energy dependence of the squared absolute value of the decay amplitude up to first order of the expansion .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 here @xmath55 represents the pion energies in the @xmath0 rest frame .",
    "figure  [ psslope ] shows the extraction of @xmath33 from @xmath56 .",
    "was obtained directly from the fit of the function @xmath57 . in the figure , @xmath56 has been scaled with @xmath58 so that the fitted line has an intercept equal to 1 on the @xmath56-axis . ]    the two mami results for @xmath33 were obtained from different data sets with different electron beam energies , @xmath59mev  @xcite and @xmath60mev  @xcite .",
    "thus , they can be considered as independent measurements .",
    "these results , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 events , represent the two world highest statistics for the @xmath47 decay .",
    "the two totally independent values for @xmath33 from mami agree perfectly with each other and are consistent with other experiments .",
    "pure @xmath3pt calculations give the wrong sign for @xmath33 , which is fixed by the experiments to be negative .",
    "dispersion calculations give the correct sign , but differ in the absolute value by several standard deviations . only the uchpt approach  @xcite produces a dalitz plot parameter consistent with the experiments .    a cusp effect due to the @xmath63 rescattering reaction , similar to the one observed by the na48 collaboration in @xmath64  @xcite",
    ", should also appear in the @xmath47 decay .",
    "this charge exchange reaction also has an impact on the dalitz plot parameter . according to  @xcite a 5% effect on @xmath33",
    "should be visible .",
    "the two recent mami measurements  @xcite with the given statistics did not find a significant indication for a cusp effect .",
    "the rare , double  radiative decay @xmath34 has attracted much attention as there are large uncertainties on its experimental decay width and in its theoretical predictions .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath3pt calculations of the amplitude for the @xmath34 transition are related to the fact that the leading term @xmath65 and the tree contributions at @xmath66 are zero as neither @xmath67 nor @xmath0 can emit a photon .",
    "the pion and kaon loops at @xmath66 are greatly suppressed due to g ",
    "parity invariance and the large mass of the kaons , respectively .",
    "the main contribution to the @xmath34 decay amplitude comes from the @xmath68 counterterms that are needed in @xmath3pt to cancel various divergences .",
    "the coefficients of these counterterms are not determined by @xmath3pt itself ; they depend on the model used for the calculation .",
    "as the @xmath34 decay has a three  body final state , its dalitz plot reflects the decay amplitude .",
    "thus , a complete test of @xmath3pt with its @xmath68 chiral coefficients requires an experimental measurement of both the @xmath34 decay rate and the dalitz plot .",
    "one can see that the existing experimental results and theoretical calculations for @xmath34 vary a lot .",
    "also , strictly speaking , the agreement between the measured and calculated decay width is not sufficient to prove @xmath3pt calculations .",
    "since every calculation of @xmath34 makes a specific prediction for the decay dalitz plot , the experimental measurement of this plot must confirm the theoretical prediction , too .",
    "roughly 150 @xmath34 events sit on a big backgrounds , stemming mainly from @xmath47 decays and @xmath69 photoproduction .",
    "the solid line shows a fit of a gaussian for the @xmath0 peak plus a polynomial for the background . ]",
    "figure  [ pspi0gg ] shows the invariant mass for selected @xmath70 events measured at mami .",
    "the 150 @xmath0 events sitting on a big background are by far not sufficient to produce an informative dalitz plot .",
    "also this statistics is lower than in the recently published result of the crystal ball at ags  @xcite , but showed a much better signal to background ratio .",
    "nevertheless , a preliminary branching ratio @xmath71 was determined .",
    "the crystal ball at mami results agrees with the value obtained at bnl within one standard deviation .",
    "both are presently the most precise data for this decay .      after improving several setup components ( pbwo@xmath31 crystals in taps ,",
    "faster read  out electronics ) a new @xmath0 physics program will be launched in 2010 . within 800 hours of beam time",
    "@xmath72 @xmath0 mesons will be produced , giving the most precise results for many @xmath0 decays .",
    "six neutral decay modes of the @xmath0 meson will be investigated simultaneously .",
    "the emphasis will be on the measurement of the dalitz plot and decay spectrum of @xmath34 , which was already preliminary investigated ( see above ) .",
    "about 10000 useful @xmath34 events are expected .",
    "furthermore , the dalitz plot of @xmath47 will be measured to investigate the speculated quadratic term for @xmath56 and the impact of the cusp at the opening of @xmath63 exchange reaction on the dalitz plot parameter .",
    "more than @xmath73 @xmath47 events are expected , improving the old mami statistics by roughly one order of magnitude . for many @xmath5 and @xmath6violating",
    "@xmath0 decays only weak upper limits for the branching ratios exist .",
    "the limits for the @xmath5violating @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 decays , and the @xmath6violating @xmath77 decay will be improved by a factor 10 with the expected @xmath72 @xmath0 mesons produced .",
    "the decays of the @xmath1 meson have been explored only with very limited statistics so far . for the most prominent neutral decay @xmath78 , with a branching ratio of @xmath79  % , the gams collaboration very recently published a result based on @xmath80 events  @xcite .",
    "this represents currently the highest available statistics for this decay . for the @xmath81 decay with a branching ratio of ( @xmath82 the gams collaboration presented the worlds highest statistics with @xmath83 events",
    "it is very important to further investigate the @xmath1 decays with high statistics .",
    "especially , existing experimental data on @xmath1 photoproduction are rather scarce .    up to now ,",
    "only tests concerning the @xmath1 meson have been done with the crystal ball , because until the end of 2006 the maximum electron energy available at mami was @xmath84  mev , while the @xmath1 photoproduction threshold is @xmath85  mev . in september 2009",
    "a further increase of the mami beam energy was achieved and now the maximum electron energy lies at @xmath13  mev . at that value",
    "the @xmath1 photoproduction cross section reaches a plateau .",
    "first test beams at @xmath86  mev and @xmath10  mev showed that @xmath1 mesons can be identified in a clean experimental environment at mami , but so far the statistics was not sufficient to obtain results with improved accuracies . to change this ,",
    "a new tagging device ( end  point tagger ) is under construction ( see sect .",
    "[ hdend ] ) , which will significantly improve the possibilities for @xmath1 physics at mami . upon completion of this apparatus a huge physical program concerning the @xmath1 will be investigated ( see sect .",
    "[ hdetapfut ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath1 photoproduction threshold is at @xmath85mev , almost the full photon energy range accessible at mami for @xmath1 production is not covered by the glasgow photon tagging spectrometer ( see above ) .",
    "therefore , a new tagging device ( end  point tagger ) is currently constructed that will detect post  radiating electrons with energies between @xmath87mev and @xmath88mev . under the defined conditions",
    "these energies correspond to photon energies between @xmath89mev and @xmath90mev . with the new maximum energy @xmath13mev photon energies between @xmath91mev and @xmath92mev",
    "could be tagged with the end ",
    "point tagger .",
    "thus , at least 100mev above the @xmath1 photoproduction threshold will be covered .    to study the neutral decays of the @xmath1 meson , the end ",
    "point tagger is essential for a clean trigger .",
    "so far , @xmath1 mesons were already measured with the crystal ball at mami , but the identification relied on the detection of outgoing protons , which mostly hit taps .",
    "taps is suitable for measuring photons , but the identification of protons is not very efficient . with the end ",
    "point tagger the detection and identification of the protons would not be required any more , and , in addition , the beam rate could be increased due to a more precise trigger .      with the installation of the end ",
    "point tagger and several setup improvements ( pbwo@xmath31 crystals in taps , faster read  out electronics ) one of the first high precision @xmath1 programs in the world will be started .",
    "approximately @xmath80 produced @xmath1 mesons per hour are expected .",
    "if the new maximum energy of @xmath13  mev can be run reliably this rate will be raised by roughly another factor two .",
    "then all results on @xmath1 decay channels investigated at mami will outreach precisions of older experiments by at least one order of magnitude",
    ".    the emphasis at mami will be on the investigation of the main neutral decay channels of the @xmath1 meson . among these",
    "is the decay @xmath78 .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath78 decay amplitude is hampered by the occurrence of a cusp effect in the @xmath69 invariant mass spectrum , due to the opening of the @xmath63 charge  exchange reaction . in  @xcite",
    "a formalism , using @xmath78 decays , has been developed to extract the @xmath93 scattering lengths @xmath94 and @xmath95 from a detailed study of the shape of the dalitz plot and the cusp .",
    "the authors of  @xcite predict a cusp effect of the order of 8% .",
    "thus , this decay offers the possibility to study the @xmath96 scattering length from the shape of the dalitz plot , and to investigate @xmath97 interactions .",
    "because the energy release in the @xmath78 decay is small , only 141  mev , the matrix element can be described by the following formulae : @xmath98 or @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the dalitz variables and @xmath102 for the @xmath78 decay bose ",

    "the @xmath81 decay has a larger phase space than the @xmath78 channel , but is g  forbidden .",
    "it still occurs as a consequence of the g  violating mass term of the qcd lagrangian with br(@xmath106 .",
    "the physics of the @xmath81 decay is similar to @xmath78 and @xmath47 . due to final state rescattering of the pions an energy dependence on the shape of the dalitz plot",
