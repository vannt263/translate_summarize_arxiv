    "theory of entanglement arising from quantum physics is now one of the main research topics in information sciences , and involves various fields of mathematics such as algebraic geometry , matrix theory , functional analysis and combinatorics . since a quantum state which is not separable is entangled , it is important to understand the structures of separable states .",
    "we note that the set @xmath0 of all separable states is a convex set , and so it is urgent to characterize the facial structures of the convex set @xmath0 .    a state on the hilbert space @xmath1",
    "is said to be separable if it is the convex combination @xmath2 of pure product states @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a @xmath5 matrix , with the dimension @xmath6 of the hilbert space @xmath7 . by definition ,",
    "pure product states are extreme points of the convex set @xmath0 , which are @xmath8-dimensional simplices .",
    "therefore , the first step to understand the facial structures of @xmath0 is to search for faces which are affinely isomorphic to higher dimensional simplices , as it was initiated by alfsen and shultz @xcite for bi - partite case with @xmath9 .",
    "we call those simplicial faces .",
    "we note that a point of a convex set determines a unique face in which it is an interior point .",
    "it is clear that the separable state @xmath10 determines a simplicial face of @xmath0 if and only if @xmath10 has a unique decomposition , for which we have a simple sufficient condition : if @xmath11 is linearly independent and its span has no more product vectors then it is clear that @xmath10 has a unique decomposition .",
    "this condition has been considered by several authors for bi - partite cases .",
    "see @xcite for example , as well as @xcite .",
    "the authors @xcite utilized the fact that linear independence of states @xmath12 are sufficient for this purpose , and found simplicial faces with higher dimensions for bi - qutrit and qubit - qudit cases .",
    "this approach was also very useful to construct entangled states with positive partial transposes .",
    "searching for those entanglement is of independent interest in the contexts of ppt criterion @xcite and distillation problem @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to continue this line of research for general multi - partite cases .",
    "we note that arbitrary choice of finitely many product vectors ( [ pv - form ] ) gives those in general position with the probability one , that is , any choice of @xmath13 vectors from @xmath14-component gives linearly independent vectors .",
    "suppose that we have @xmath15 product vectors in general position .",
    "if @xmath16 then we show that they are linearly independent , and if @xmath17 then there is no more product vectors in their span up to scalar multiplications .",
    "therefore , the corresponding product states make a simplicial face .",
    "this extends the result in @xcite to multi - partite case . in the @xmath18-qubit case",
    ", we see that an arbitrary choice of @xmath18 product vectors in general position gives us a separable state with unique decomposition .    in the three - qubit case",
    ", we go further .",
    "we show that four product vectors in general position give separable states with unique decomposition if and only if they are also in general position as product vectors in @xmath19 .",
    "those separable states are of rank four . as for rank five separable states",
    ", we note that generic five dimensional spaces have exactly six product vectors .",
    "it turns out that these six product vectors give rise to linearly independent pure product states , and any choice of five product vectors among them must be linearly independent .",
    "therefore , they give rise to a simplicial face which is affinely isomorphic to the five dimensional simplex @xmath20 with six extreme points . if we take an interior point @xmath21 of this face then it is of rank five .",
    "because an interior point @xmath22 in a maximal face also has rank five , we can extend the line segment from @xmath21 to @xmath22 to get an entangled state with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) .",
    "the endpoint of this line segment in the set of ppt states must be a ppt entangled state ( pptes ) of rank four .",
    "a standard method to construct a pptes is to use unextendible product basis @xcite .",
    "this method gives rise to general construction of a pptes of rank four in the two qutrit case , as it was shown in @xcite .",
    "but , it is far from being true in three qubit case , since generic four dimensional spaces have no product vectors .",
    "our construction covers ppt entangled states of rank four which can not be constructed by unextendible product basis .",
    "furthermore , we give an explicit formula for those entangled states in terms of six product vectors in generic five dimensional spaces .    in the next section ,",
    "we collect basic facts on product vectors in general position and generalized unextendible product basis and give examples for further references , even though some of them must be known to the specialists .",
    "we consider the general multi - partite cases in section 3 , and concentrate on three qubit case in section 4 .",
    "after we construct three qubit ppt entangled states with rank four in section 5 , we close this paper with discussions on @xmath18-qubit cases and questions in the last section . throughout this paper , a product vector @xmath23 will also be written as @xmath24 , and we denote by @xmath25 the usual basis of @xmath26 .",
    "we are grateful to lin chen for useful discussion on the topics .",
    "a finite set @xmath11 of product vectors in ( [ pv - form ] ) is said to be in general position ( gp ) , if for each @xmath27 and a subset @xmath28 of @xmath29 with @xmath30 the set @xmath31 is linearly independent in @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
