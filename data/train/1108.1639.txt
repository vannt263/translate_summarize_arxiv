    "optical transitions with ultranarrow frequencies in the single positively charged ions which use advanced laser cooling and trapping techniques are of current interest for frequency standards @xcite",
    ". some of the successful single ion optical atomic clocks are hg@xmath1 @xcite , ca@xmath1 @xcite , sr@xmath1 @xcite , al@xmath1 @xcite , yb@xmath1 @xcite etc .",
    ", among these the fractional uncertainty in hg@xmath1 and al@xmath1 have already reached 10@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "a new range of experiments are also proposed for other ions like ba@xmath1 @xcite , ra@xmath1 @xcite , in@xmath1 @xcite , yb@xmath1 @xcite etc .",
    "more precise frequency standards will open - up possibilities to study the underlying physics related to fundamental constants , probing new elementary physics , more importantly it can help in improving the present day global positioning systems and also tracking of deep - space probes @xcite",
    ".    one of the major fortifications to attain smaller fractional uncertainties in the optical frequency standard measurements using ions is the accurate measurement of black - body radiation ( bbr ) shifts .",
    "the considered standard frequency is shifted from the atomic resonance value due to the interaction of the ion with the external stray electromagnetic fields present in and around the experimental apparatus @xcite .",
    "the bbr shift is caused by the isotropic field radiated due to finite temperature of the apparatus @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to the bbr - induced energy shift is from the electric dipole ( e1 ) component of the radiation field ; which have been gauged by many groups for a number of ions using the relativistic theories @xcite .",
    "however , there is absolutely no rigorous estimate of the bbr shift due to higher multipoles for any proposed scheme .",
    "following derivations for e1 bbr shift in @xcite , porsev and derevianko have given a generalized derivation @xcite to deduce the bbr shifts spawned by any multipole component of the electromagnetic field .",
    "two of the proficiency gadgets for the optical frequency standards are with a single calcium ion ( @xmath5ca@xmath1 ) @xcite trapped in a paul trap and with a strontium ion ( @xmath6sr@xmath1 ) confined in an endcap trap @xcite .",
    "the considered clock transitions in these ions are the @xmath7 transitions operating in the optical regime , the principles are similar to the proposed ba@xmath1 @xcite , ra@xmath1 @xcite and yb@xmath1 @xcite based frequency standards .",
    "a major advantage of using @xmath5ca@xmath1 ion is that the radiation required for cooling , repumping , and clock transition is easily produced by non - bulky solid state or diode laser  @xcite .",
    "the reported frequency measurements of the transition for frequency standard in @xmath6sr@xmath1 have achieved a spectral resolution of better than 1.5 hz  @xcite .",
    "as has been proclaimed , these experiments have the dexterity to diminish the relative systematic uncertainties to a level of @xmath8 or below @xcite . in such a scenario",
    ", it is compelling to estimate the bbr shifts caused by the higher multipoles , especially through the m1 and e2 channels for the experiments comprising the @xmath7 transitions as in the above ions .",
    "such an attempt was made by porsev and derevianko @xcite for divalent atoms like mg , ca , sr , and yb . in this paper , we extend the work to preview the bbr shifts commenced by the m1 and e2 multipoles in the ions ; particularly for the @xmath5ca@xmath1 and @xmath6sr@xmath1 ions where the efficacious experiments are in progress to reduce the uncertainties over their previous measurements @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : first , we discuss the inception of the bbr shifts which embodies the m1 and e2 contributions of the radiation field .",
    "then , we discuss the method of calculation in the @xmath5ca@xmath1 and @xmath6sr@xmath1 ions subsequently presenting the results for the above multipolar contributions to the bbr shifts in these ions before recapitulating the work . unless stated otherwise , we use the conventional system of atomic units , a.u . , in which @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the reduced planck constant @xmath11 have the numerical value one .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between an electron in an atomic system with the external propagating electromagnetic field in the coulomb gauge coupling is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dirac matrix in operator form , @xmath14 is the angular frequency of the field and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are its wave vector and polarization direction , respectively . in the presence of this interaction , the energy shift that can occur for an atomic energy level @xmath17 with energy @xmath18",
    "can be approximated to @xcite @xmath19 using the multipolar expansion and in terms of the traditional multipole moments @xmath20 , we have @xcite @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\pi ( 2l+1)(l+1)}{l } } q_{lm}^{\\lambda } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eqn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represents the electric and magnetic multipoles , respectively .    using the relations @xmath24 and @xmath25 and combining all the above expressions , the energy shift for an isotropic field after averaging over @xmath14 for all the polarization and propagation directions",
    "is given as  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angular momentum of state @xmath17 and @xmath28 here argument @xmath29 .",
    "the function @xmath30 is a universal function applicable to all the atoms with argument @xmath31 depending on the range of the atomic parameters .",
    "these functions were first introduced by farley and wing  @xcite in the e1 case and are extended in a general form in this work to emanate simpler forms for the energy shift expressions . in the limit @xmath32 which corresponds to the case when the transition energy is much larger than the temperature ( @xmath33 ) is of our current interest .    substituting values from eq .",
    "( [ eqnf ] ) in eq.([eqn7 ] ) , the bbr shift for @xmath34 can be expressed as @xmath35    now at the room temperature ( 300 k ) , the bbr shift for the e1 channel can be given as @xmath36 ^ 4 \\alpha_n^{e1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas for the m1 channel can be reduced to @xmath37 ^ 4 \\alpha_n^{m1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the scalar e1 polarizability , scalar m1 polarizability , the averaged e1 induced electric field and the averaged m1 induced magnetic fields , respectively .    similarly , substituting values from eq .",
    "( [ eqn16 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqn7 ] ) , the bbr shifts for @xmath42 comes out as @xmath43 which corresponds to the e2 and m2 channels .",
    "therefore , the bbr shift at the room temperature for the e2 channel is given by @xmath44 ^ 6 \\alpha_n^{e2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the scalar e2 polarizability and @xmath46 is the averaged e2 induced electric field .",
    "accumulating all the above expressions , the bbr shifts due to both the m1 and e2 channels for an atomic transition @xmath47 at room temperature can now be given in the forms @xmath48 ^ 4   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left ( \\alpha_f^{m1 } - \\alpha_i^{m1}\\right ) , \\label{eqn19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 ^ 6   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\left ( \\alpha_f^{e2 } - \\alpha_i^{e2}\\right ) , \\label{eqn20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "in order to determine m1 and e2 polarizabilities in the considered systems , which have closed - shell configurations with one valence electron each , we first calculate the dirac - fock ( df ) wave function ( @xmath50 ) for the corresponding closed - shell configurations , then append the valence orbital ( @xmath51 ) to define a new reference state ( i.e. @xmath52 ) in the fock space . to obtain the exact atomic wave functions ( asfs ) , the core ,",
    "core - valence and valence correlation effects are accounted by defining wave operators @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . i.e. the exact asf @xmath56 with a valence orbital @xmath51 is given by @xmath57 we adopt the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method in the fock - space to determine asfs . with @xmath33 and @xmath58",
    "representing the core electrons and core electrons with the valence electron excitation operators , respectively , the above asf in the rcc framework can be encapsulated in a form @xcite @xmath59 where the asf for the closed - shell configuration is given by @xmath53 defining @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we have mentioned @xmath63 for @xmath54 to emphasize on the fact that the @xmath33 operator in this case excites at least one of the core electrons to the valence orbital .",
    "all these correlation effects are coupled in the course of the asf determination .",
    "the equations determining the coupled - cluster amplitudes and energies are accustomed in compact forms as @xmath64 and @xmath65 where the notation @xmath66 represents for the excited hole - particle states , @xmath67 denotes the connected terms of the dirac - coulomb ( dc ) hamiltonian ( @xmath68 ) with the @xmath33 operators , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the correlation energy and attachment energy ( also equivalent to negative of the ionization potential ( ip ) ) of the electron of orbital @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "it can be noticed that the reference states @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn23 ] ) and @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn24 ] ) contain different number of particles , hence the hamiltonian used in the respective equations describe different number of particles in our fock space representation .",
    "we have considered contributions only from the singly and doubly excited states along with some important valence triple excitations which are included perturbatively ; the approach is known as ccsd(t ) method in the literature ( e.g. see @xcite ) .    to calculate the scalar polarizabilities , it is precedence to adopt an approach similar to @xcite or it would be prudent to follow a procedure given in @xcite",
    ". such approaches may be required for achieving better accuracies .",
    "accumulating from the previous expressions , the general definition of the scalar polarizability is given by @xmath74    procuring the derivations in eq .",
    "( [ mateq ] ) , we can now write @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are referred to as core , core - valence and valence correlation contributions , respectively .    in the sum - over - states approach as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) , it is convenient to determine the low - lying singly excited states @xmath79 with respect to the @xmath80 states that are of our interest for both the considered ions .",
    "contributions from these states corresponds to the above mentioned valence correlation contributions , which are the dominant ones compared to the contributions to the part arising from higher level excited states that can be estimated from a lower order perturbation theory .",
    "contrasting to this contribution , it is not possible to estimate the core and core - valence correlation contributions in a similar procedure . as it was stated above , methods describing in @xcite",
    "would be befitting to account them rigorously .",
    "notwithstanding this fact , it will not alter the bbr shifts what is the primary intent of the work .",
    "this is because of two reasons : first , the core correlation effect may be notable but in the bbr shift estimation this contribution cancels out between the transition states .",
    "however , we calculate them using the third order relativistic many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt(3 ) ) to present the total polarizability results .",
    "secondly , it is observed in the earlier works that the core - valence contributions are minuscule in the dipole polarizability determinations @xcite which is further verified below in the present work .",
    "so it is not necessary to employ a powerful method at the cost of heavy computation to determine these tiny contributions for which we use again the mbpt(3 ) method to estimate these contributions within the required precision level . in this approach ,",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the first order perturbed wave function for @xmath80 due to @xmath83 which is obtained by solving the following equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the energy correction due to @xmath83 .",

    "in summary , we have estimated the black - body radiation shifts due to the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole multipoles for the @xmath209 and @xmath215 transitions in the singly ionized calcium and strontium , respectively .",
    "the contribution due to the former is the decisive in this case .",
    "nevertheless , the reported polarizabilities for the considered states which are rarely studied in the above ions may also be useful for other purposes",
    ". it may be imperative to contemplate the reported shifts which are given as @xmath2 hz and @xmath3 hz in the considered ions to achieve the @xmath0 precision uncertainty in the proposed clock experiments .",
    "the work of b.a . was supported by the department of science and technology , india .",
    "computations were carried out using 3tflop hpc cluster at physical research laboratory , ahmedabad .",
    "with the aid @xmath216 , the following the expression @xmath217 gives for @xmath34 as @xmath218    further by using the definite integral value @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the bernoulli number , @xmath221 reduces to @xmath222    similarly for @xmath42 , the above expression turns out to be @xmath223",
    "in our approach , we write @xmath224 can be expressed as @xmath225 where we have facilitated the generalized wick s theorem to derive these terms and assumed all the operators are in normal order form and only the connected terms are survived . for simplicity",
    "the first two terms , the second term and the last three terms are categorized into core ( c ) , core - valence ( cn ) and valence ( n ) contributions , respectively ; i.e. in an abbreviate form it is given as @xmath226    13 p. gill , metrologia * 42 * , s125 ( 2005 ) .",
