    "the metric we shall consider is schwarzschild s vacuum metric expressed in isotropic coordinates@xcite : @xmath3 which we embed in 6 + 1 dimensional minkowski space , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the isochronal dimension : @xmath6 all of the functions remain real if @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    figure [ fig : isotropic ] shows slices of this manifold for the critical case of @xmath9 .    , and @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "the manifold rotates in the @xmath12 plane.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the @xmath10 slice in this figure , appears as a line spinning in the @xmath12 plane at a rate of @xmath13 .",
    "the tip of the curve corresponds to the event horizon , which is also at the waist of the @xmath14 slice .",
    "this tip is spinning at the speed of light .",
    "that is , the velocity vector becomes null at this point .",
    "the velocity of each point on the curve models the time dilation we see in a gravitational field , which the minkowski space , @xmath4 , takes care automatically .    the rotation of the manifold models acceleration .",
    "there are two components of this acceleration : an in - manifold component and an out - of - manifold component .",
    "the in - manifold component , which is in the @xmath15 direction , models the acceleration due to gravity .. ]",
    "consider the line element for a static , spherically symmetric manifold : @xmath16 the first step is to define the isochronal , time - like function : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a free parameter .",
    "we then remove that term from ( [ eq : general ] ) leaving a riemannian sub - metric , which we then embed .",
    "we use an idea due to kasner @xcite as carried forward by fronsdal @xcite and @xmath19 in these functions without creating unwanted off - diagonal terms in the metric tensor .",
    "kasner used this property to represent the schwarzschild metric in six dimensions using two time - like dimensions .",
    "fronsdal used hyperbolic functions and required only one time - like dimension .",
    "neither of these embeddings were isochronal , however . ] to create the function , @xmath20 , while compensating for the term introduced by @xmath21 : @xmath22 the term , @xmath23 , is included in the circular function arguments to balance units .",
    "we ensure that @xmath24 and @xmath25 remain real by demanding @xmath26 .",
    "the term , @xmath27 , is a second free parameter .",
    "the spherical term can be captured in the following three functions : @xmath28    so far , we have a metric tensor that defines a line segment as : @xmath29 \\,dr^{2}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "we will use @xmath30 to correct the coefficient of @xmath31 : @xmath32 the requirement that each of these functions remain real , places constraints on the two free parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that the manifold is dynamic , even though the metric tensor is static .",
    "this is a general result : any isochronal manifold that admits a metric that has nonvanishing gravitational field must be dynamic .",
    "if it were not , there would be no acceleration due to gravity since the space - time we are embedding within is flat .",
    "as demonstrated above , the isochronal embedding method is applicable to metrics that can be placed in diagonal form with bounded , real functions , @xmath20 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and with @xmath35 everywhere non - negative for some fixed value of @xmath18 and @xmath27 .",
    "while these constraints exclude a global embedding of the schwarzschild metric , we can find a piece of a manifold that has the schwarzschild metric ( the piece outside the event horizon ) :    @xmath36    we can see that the two manifolds , ( [ eq : isotropic1 ] ) and ( [ eq : schwarzschild ] ) , are identical over their range of mutual validity  just use the transformation to isotropic coordinates@xcite : @xmath37 we can also see this qualitatively in figure [ fig : schwarzschild ] .    )",
    "is identical to the one defined using ( [ eq : isotropic1 ] ) over the range of mutual validity .",
    "this embedding method fails at the event horizon because of the coordinate singularity in ( [ eq : schwarzschild]).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we can see clearly that embedding ( [ eq : schwarzschild ] ) fails at the event horizon , while embedding ( [ eq : isotropic1 ] ) , does not .",
    "this offers a way to analytically continue a manifold in a natural way .",
    "- @xmath38 about the event horizon , it does not fold @xmath39 , since @xmath39 is defined by an integral with a non - negative integrand .",
    "thus we have an analytic continuation , not a folding of the manifold . ]",
    "this example also shows that the manifold itself is coordinate - free .",
    "that is , the manifold image ( as seen in figures [ fig : isotropic ] and [ fig : schwarzschild ] , in this case ) is independent of the coordinate system used to express the metric ( over the range of validity of the embedding ) .",
    "we have demonstrated a method for decomposing certain semi - riemannian metric tensors into a riemannian tensor and an isochronal tensor .",
    "we have shown that we can embed the riemannian portion in euclidean space , @xmath40 , and then add a single time - like isochronal dimension to that space to create a @xmath0 minkowski space .",
    "the resulting manifold , embedded in the minkowski space , admits to the given metric tensor .",
    "the resulting manifold provides a particularly simple way to visualize the force and time dilation caused by gravity .    for this class of metric",
    ", the various embedding theorems that apply to riemannian manifolds can be extended to apply to semi - riemannian manifolds . and",
    "since there is considerable experience in the mathematical community with riemannian manifolds , it is hoped that progress may be made applying other tools to metrics that admit to at least a local , isochronal embedding .",
