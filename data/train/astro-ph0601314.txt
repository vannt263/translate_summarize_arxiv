    "* ) external spiral galaxy ( sb , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) making it one of the premier laboratories for understanding spiral galaxies like our own . tracing",
    "the spiral structure in m31 is an obvious first step , which has been done with varying degrees of success for many years .",
    "however , the high inclination ( 74 - 78@xmath2 ) of m31 makes it difficult to determine its large - scale structure .",
    "in particular , there is no clear consensus regarding the organization of spiral structure in this important galaxy .",
    "the earliest quantitative studies focused on optical tracers such as hii regions @xcite , ob associations @xcite , and dark nebulae @xcite .",
    "these studies generally found structures consistent with a two - armed spiral ( for the case for a one - armed spiral see * ? ? ? * ) , but invoked disturbances such as varying inclinations and warps to account for the deviations from simple logarithmic spirals .",
    "more recently , hi @xcite and co @xcite have been used .",
    "the velocity information available for these gas tracers can be used to disentangle the pileup of information due to m31 s high inclination .",
    "these studies have found strong evidence for a two - armed spiral structure , but still suffer from the difficulty in connecting spiral arm segments into a coherent pattern .",
    "the difficulty in finding coherent spiral structure in m31 is plausibly related to the interactions of m31 with its two nearest satellites , m32 and ngc 205 .",
    "disturbances in m31 are revealed by tidal features far outside m31 s disk visible in deep , wide - field optical imaging @xcite .",
    "m32 is understood to be the perturber of the spiral arms @xcite while ngc 205 has been modeled as the cause of the warp seen in the optical and hi disk of m31 @xcite . quantifying the effects of m31 s satellite galaxies",
    "is complicated by the lack of measured proper motions and uncertainties in relative distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another difficulty in quantifying m31 s spiral structure has been the lack of appropriate tracers in the innermost regions of the galaxy .",
    "optical tracers are overwhelmed by the bright stellar bulge , while hi and co , which would be easily seen through the bulge , are largely absent @xcite as the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the central region is composed mainly of ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared ( far - ir ) emission can circumvent these difficulties as it traces the dust in m31 , which penetrates the stellar bulge and should trace all phases of the ism .    the first far - ir images of m31 were obtained with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100  . the most prominent feature in these images is the bright , @xmath010  kpc radius , ring of star formation @xcite seen previously in h@xmath3 images @xcite .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) imaged m31 at 175  finding both the bright ring and a fainter ring at larger radii @xcite .",
    "the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) provided an image of m31 at 8.3  revealing possible spiral structure inside the @xmath010  kpc ring .",
    "the resolutions of the iras ( @xmath4 ) and iso ( @xmath5 ) images reveal the overall morphology , but are not high enough to reveal the structure of the spiral arms .",
    "we present new infrared images of m31 taken with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) instrument on the spitzer space telescope ( spitzer , * ? ? ?",
    "the mips spatial resolution at the distance of m31 is @xmath6/23  pc , @xmath7/68  pc , and @xmath8/151  pc at 24 , 70 , and 160  , respectively .",
    "this paper concentrates on the newly - revealed details of m31 s infrared morphology as shown in the mips images",
    "the mips images of m31 were taken on 25  aug  2004 .",
    "a region approximately @xmath9 oriented along the major axis of m31 was covered with 7 scan maps .",
    "each map consisted of medium rate scan legs and cross scan offsets of 148  with lengths varying between @xmath10 and @xmath11 to efficiently map m31 and its satellite galaxy ngc  205 .",
    "the mips dat v2.90 @xcite was used to process and mosaic the individual images . at 24  extra steps",
    "were carried out to improve the images including readout offset correction , array averaged background subtraction ( using a low order polynomial fit to each leg , with the region including m31 excluded from this fit ) , and exclusion of the 1st five images in each scan leg due to boost frame transients . at 70 and 160  , the extra processing step was a pixel dependent background subtraction for each map ( technique same as 24  ) .",
    "the background subtraction does not remove real m31 emission as the scan legs are nearly parallel to the minor axis with the background regions being far from m31 s disk .",
    "the final mosaics have exposure times of @xmath0100 , @xmath040 , and @xmath09 seconds / pixel for 24 , 70 , and 160  , respectively , and are shown in figure  [ fig_m31_fullres ] .    the ir spectral energy distribution of m31 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_m31_ir_sed ] .",
    "the global mips fluxes measured in a @xmath12 rectangular aperture ( the background was subtracted in the data reduction ) are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15  jy for 24 , 70 , and 160  , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties are dominated by the systematic uncertainties in the mips calibration @xcite .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the mips and previous ir measurements .",
    "the mips images in fig .  [ fig_m31_fullres ] are dominated by the @xmath010  kpc ring .",
    "the deprojected iso image showed that the ring is fairly circular , but with an obvious splitting near the position of m32 @xcite .",
    "this splitting is now seen to extend over @xmath01/4 of the ring .",
    "the outer ring seen with iso is seen in the mips images , but appears to be relatively incomplete .",
    "overall , the morphology of the disk of m31 in the infrared appears more disturbed on the left - hand ( southwest ) than right - hand ( northeast ) side of the galaxy .",
    "the mips images show emission extending beyond their edges along the major axis , implying that the infrared extent of m31 is larger than @xmath16/40.9  kpc .",
    "a comparison of the mips 160  image with the latest hi image ( braun et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "reveals dust emission where there is hi emission .",
    "the gas and dust seem well mixed even in the outer regions of m31 .",
    "the infrared emission in the nuclear region has a component with hotter dust than the rest of m31 ( but also a cold component due to the emission seen in the 160  image ) .",
    "this is consistent with the nuclear region gas being dominated by ionized gas as seen in h@xmath3 @xcite as well as emission from agb stars in the bulge . as the flux from the nucleus fades towards longer wavelengths , the two spots above and below along the minor axis gain prominence .",
    "the prominence of the spot above the nucleus was noticed by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "these spots appear to be the ends of a bar and the beginning of spiral arms .",
    "the location of these spots and appearance of the nuclear region ( especially at 70  ) is similar to the triaxial bulge simulations of @xcite .    to investigate the morphology in more detail",
    ", the images have been deprojected assuming an inclination of @xmath17 , and displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_m31_deproj ] . usually the inclination is picked visually to make the galaxy most spiral - like or circular in the deprojected frame . to be more objective ,",
    "the inclination we use is the median value of the independently calculated inclinations of the spiral arm segments investigated by @xcite .",
    "arc - like structures dominate the morphology of the region inside the @xmath010  kpc ring and appear to be spiral arms with starting points at ends of a bar .",
    "the existence of a bar in m31 has been suggested in the past @xcite .",
    "since circularly symmetric objects will deproject into elongated bars , the evidence for a bar is based on the prominence of the two spots near the nucleus at 160  , not on the appearance of a bar in the nuclear region at 24  .    to determine the parameters of any spiral arms , fig .",
    "[ fig_m31_ir_regions ] gives plots in polar and cartesian coordinates of the locations of compact ir objects seen in all three mips bands .",
    "these regions are likely to be star forming regions ( e.g. , hii regions and ob associations ) which are excellent spiral arm tracers .",
    "point source photometry was done using starfinder @xcite after convolving the 24 and 70  images to the 160  resolution using custom convolution kernels ( gordon et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "ensuring the same physical regions were measured in the three mips bands .    in polar coordinates ,",
    "a logarithmic spiral is a line with a non - zero slope and a circle is a horizontal line .",
    "the strongest feature is the wavy line around ln(radius ) = 3.75 representing the @xmath010  kpc ring .",
    "this wavy line is fit well by a circle offset from the nucleus by ( 5.5 , 3.0 ) with a radius of 43/9.8  kpc , except for the region around @xmath18 where the ring splits .",
    "the remarkable circularity of this ring makes it difficult to explain this structure as spiral arm segments .",
    "two logarithmic spirals are plotted which roughly follow the spiral structure .",
    "these trailing spirals have pitch angles of 9@xmath2 and @xmath19 , and are phase shifted by 166@xmath2 .",
    "these two spirals trace most of the structure inside the ring as well as some of the structure outside the ring .",
    "these two spirals are not unique solutions , but reasonable given the disturbed nature of m31 .",
    "the pitch angles used here are larger than found in previous work , consistent with not including the offset @xmath010  kpc ring as part of the spiral structure .",
    "we found that our simple logarithmic spirals plus an offset circle give as good or better representation of the mips sources than the @xcite spiral arm segments when the segments were deprojected in the same manner as the mips sources .    finding that m31 has an offset , star forming ring which is not just a superposition of spiral arm segments raises the question : `` what is the origin of the ring ? '' the ring could be due to internal resonances which can cause three different types of rings : nuclear , inner , and outer @xcite .",
    "the m31 ring is clearly not nuclear or an inner ring which is directly associated with bar .",
    "the m31 ring could be an outer ring which is associated with the outer lindblad resonance / radius of corotation .",
    "the radius of corotation is placed around 18  kpc by @xcite .",
    "the ring could also be caused by interactions like those seen in the cartwheel galaxy @xcite .",
    "an interesting clue to the possible origin of the ring is the splitting of the ring by m32 s passage through m31 s disk ( @xmath20[sec_model ] ) .",
    "is this a coincidence or cause of the ring ?",
    "a detailed study of the origin of m31 s ring is clearly needed .    while the logarithmic spirals plotted in fig .  [ fig_m31_ir_regions ] represent the data well , there are clear deviations from these spirals in addition to the well defined circle of star formation",
    ". the known interactions between m31 and its satellite galaxies m32 and ngc 205 imply these interactions may be the cause of the deviations from regular spiral structures .",
    "the dynamical effects that m32 and ngc 205 have on m31 were investigated by running a number of numerical simulations of the m31-m32 and m31-ngc 205 interactions using gadget2 @xcite . these simulations self - consistently model gravity and hydrodynamics .",
    "in addition , we have implemented star formation following @xcite , cooling using the mappings iii ( http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/@xmath0ralph/map.html ) collisional ionization equilibrium models for [ fe / h]=-0.5 , and a combination of thermal and kinetic feedback from supernovae ( * ? ? ? * with @xmath21 ) using the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "we used only the tree algorithm when calculating the gravitational forces as we found that the default treepm method introduced unacceptably large numerical artifacts .",
    "the initial conditions for m31 were the `` m31a '' equilibrium disk - bulge - halo model of @xcite , with 132092 , 48000 , and 357192 particles in each component respectively .",
    "a randomly - sampled fraction of the resulting disk particles were turned into gas particles such that the radial gas density profile followed the sum of the hi ( braun et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and co @xcite gas profiles except in the inner region where we assume a constant density to account for the mass of ionized gas . m32 and ngc  205",
    "are modeled as point particles , with radial velocities taken from @xcite .",
    "the current line - of - sight distances to the satellite galaxies were varied within the uncertainties of current estimates ( m32 : @xcite ; ngc  205 : @xcite ) , and the velocities in the plane of the sky were varied freely in order to find configurations where each satellite has recently passed through the disk of m31 .    in figure  [ fig_m31_deproj ]",
    "we show an image of one such simulation of m31 after an interaction with m32 , assuming that m32 currently lies 8  kpc behind the nucleus of m31 , has a velocity in the plane of the sky of @xmath22 sse , and has a mass of @xmath23 ( 35 times larger than current estimates @xcite ) .",
    "we also show an image of a simulation with no satellite . the passage of m32 through the disk of m31 results in a burst of star formation that propagates outward through the disk resulting in a large hole similar in size and location to the observed splitting of the star forming ring .",
    "the location and age of the star forming region ngc  206 is consistent with this star formation @xcite .",
    "we find that such a feature rapidly distorts due to differential rotation , and so its present symmetric appearance indicates that the disk passage occurred very recently ( 20  myr ago in this model ) .",
    "if we use a mass of @xmath24 for m32 , as suggested by @xcite , very little effect is seen on the disk of m31 , suggesting that m32 may be more massive than previously thought .",
    "it is interesting to note that the input high density gas ring is pulled off - center ( @xmath0@xmath25 ) by the satellite interaction , similar but smaller than the observed offset ( @xmath26 ) . the simulated ring fragments into spiral arms and ,",
    "therefore , is not as apparent as the observed ring .",
    "the mass of ngc  205 is uncertain ( @xcite calculates a mass of approximately @xmath27 ) and therefore its ability to strongly affect the disk of m31 is equally uncertain .",
    "we have run a number of simulations of ngc  205 , and while we can find orbits for which it passes through and temporarily distorts the spiral structure in the disk , we have been unable to find one which produces a hole that matches the observed split in the ring .",
    "however , an exhaustive search of the parameter space has not yet been carried out .",
    "it is a generic feature in all of our models ( with or without satellite interaction ) that the gas in the central region of m31 ends up at a temperature greater than @xmath28  k , consistent with the observation of ionized gas in the nuclear region .",
    "this behavior is not seen in models with a fully exponential gas disk ; therefore , the hot nucleus is a direct result of the central depression of the gas density .",
    "as central depressions are commonly seen in the hi profiles of disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our simulations suggest that a large fraction of the gas in the centers of disk galaxies is ionized .",
    "we have presented new mips images of m31 at 24 , 70 , and 160  which have higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than previous infrared images .",
    "these new images reveal the presence of two spiral arms in addition to a ring of star formation .",
    "the spiral arms appear to emanate from a bar in the nuclear region and can be roughly traced out beyond the @xmath010  kpc ring of star formation . the ring of star formation forms an almost complete circle which is offset from the nucleus and split near the location of m32 .",
    "this ring of star formation and the disturbed spiral arms are indications that interactions may be affecting the morphology of m31 .",
    "dynamical models of m31 interacting with m32 predict morphology qualitatively similar to m31 s ( while models with ngc  205 instead of m32 give only small perturbations ) . specifically , both the splitting and the offset of the star forming ring are seen as well as copious spiral arms .",
    "it seems that m31 is not an undisturbed normal spiral galaxy , but one which has been significantly affected by interactions .",
    "this paper presents a preview of the possibilities becoming available to understand m31 .",
    "data covering the majority of this galaxy are available in the x - ray ( xmm , trudolyubov et al . , in prep .",
