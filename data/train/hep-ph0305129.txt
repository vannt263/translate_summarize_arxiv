    "these equations are decoupled and identical for all fields .",

    "<S> for instance the @xmath1 element of the quark mixing matrix is now known with a precision of few percents @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover many independent measurements are now over - constraining the quark parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , and the success of the theory in fitting all the data is really impressive . also the picture in the lepton sector has been greatly clarified and , even if we have not yet obtained precise determination of mass and mixing parameters , nevertheless a clear pattern has been identified from the solutions to the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems @xcite .    on the theoretical side , we should honestly admit that flavour still represents one of the great mysteries in particle physics . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know the scale at which the flavour dynamics sets in . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps at this scale a conventional , four dimensional , picture still holds thus allowing us to analyze the flavour problem in the context of a local quantum field theory in four space - time dimensions . here the most powerful tool that we have to decipher the observed hierarchy among the different masses and mixing angles is that of spontaneously broken flavour symmetries @xcite . in the idealized limit of exact symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> only the heaviest fermions are massive : the top quark and , maybe , the whole third family . </S>",
    "<S> the lightest fermions and the small mixing angles originate from breaking effects . </S>",
    "<S> this beautiful idea has been widely explored in many possible versions , with discrete or continuous symmetries , global or local ones . </S>",
    "<S> a realistic description of fermion masses in this framework typically requires either a large number of parameters or a high degree of complexity and we are probably unable to select the best model among the many existing ones . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in four dimensions we have little hopes to understand why there are exactly three generations .    </S>",
    "<S> it might be the case that at the energy scale characterizing flavour physics a four - dimensional description breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> for instance this happens in superstring theories where the space - time is ten or eleven dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> in the ten dimensional heterotic string six dimensions can be compactified on a calabi - yau manifold @xcite or on orbifolds @xcite and the flavour properties are strictly related to the features of the compact space . in calabi - yau compactifications </S>",
    "<S> the number of chiral generations is proportional to the euler characteristics of the manifold . in orbifold compactifications , </S>",
    "<S> matter in the twisted sector is localized around the orbifold fixed points and the yukawa couplings , arising from world - sheet instantons , have a natural geometrical interpretation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently string realizations where the light matter fields of the standard model arises from intersecting branes have been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> also in this context the flavour dynamics is controlled by topological properties of the geometrical construction @xcite , having no counterpart in four dimensional field theories .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps in the future the flavour mystery will be unraveled by string theory , but in the meantime it would be interesting to explore , in a pure field theoretical construction , the possibility of extra space - like dimensions . we can then take advantage of the greater freedom that a bottom - up field - theory approach possesses compared to string theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover in the last years a lot of progress has been done in understanding field theories with extra spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> these theories are ultraviolet divergent and should be cut - off at some energy scale @xmath2 , but they can still be useful as effective descriptions at low energies , including the compactification scale . </S>",
    "<S> semi - realistic models have been proposed within orbifold compactification , allowing for light chiral fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the compactification mechanism and the orbifold projection have also been exploited to break supersymmetry @xcite and/or gauge symmetry @xcite with distinctive and attractive features @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it has soon been realized that also in a field theoretical description the existence of extra dimensions could have important consequences for the flavour problem . </S>",
    "<S> for instance in orbifold compactifications light four dimensional fermions may be either localized at the orbifold fixed points or they may arise as zero modes of higher - dimensional spinors , with a wave function suppressed by the square root of the volume of the compact space . </S>",
    "<S> this led to several interesting proposals . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that the smallness of neutrino masses could be reproduced if the left - handed active neutrinos sit at a fixed point and the right - handed sterile partners live in the bulk of a large fifth dimension @xcite . in five dimensional grand unified theories the heaviness of the third generation can be explained by localizing the corresponding fields on a fixed point , whereas the relative lightness of the first two generations as well as the breaking of the unwanted mass relations can be obtained by using bulk fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> even more interesting is the case when a higher dimensional spinor interacts with a non - trivial background of solitonic type . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known for a long time that this provides a mechanism to obtain massless four dimensional chiral fermions @xcite . moreover , since the wave functions for the zero modes of the dirac operator are localized around the core of the topological defect , such a mechanism can play a relevant role in explaining the observed hierarchy in the fermion spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mass terms arise dynamically from the overlap among fermion and higgs wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> typically , there is an exponential mapping between the parameters of the higher dimensional theory and the four dimensional masses and mixing angles , so that even with parameters of order one large hierarchies are created @xcite . in orbifold compactifications </S>",
    "<S> , solitons are simulated by scalar fields with a non - trivial parity assignment that forbids constant non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . under certain conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the energy is minimized by field configurations with a non - trivial dependence upon the compact coordinates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case the zero modes of the dirac operator in such a background can be chiral and localized in specific regions of the compact space .    in models of this sort , several zero modes can originate from a single higher dimensional spinor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the model studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite there is a vortex solution that arises in the presence of two infinite extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to choose the vortex background in such a way that the number of chiral zero modes of the four dimensional dirac operator is three . </S>",
    "<S> each single six dimensional spinor gives rise to three massless four dimensional modes with the same quantum numbers , thus providing an elegant mechanism for understanding the fermion replica . </S>",
    "<S> recently this model has been extended to the case of compact extra dimensions @xcite .    in the present work we propose a model where the different fermion generations originate from orbifold compactification , with a natural hierarchy among the fermion masses and with a non - trivial mixing in flavour space . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case of two extra dimensions compactified on the orbifold @xmath3 , which allows for a straightforward inclusion of localized gauge fields . </S>",
    "<S> matter is described by vector - like six dimensional fermions with the gauge quantum numbers of one standard model generation . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the model has neither bulk nor localized gauge anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on a toy model with two generations , to discuss in a simple setting the features of our proposal and postpone the search for a fully realistic model to a future investigation . </S>",
    "<S> the two generations arise as zero modes of the dirac operator by eliminating the unwanted chiralities of vector - like six dimensional spinors through an orbifold projection . by consistency </S>",
    "<S> , the fermion mass is required to be @xmath4-odd and , as a consequence , the two independent zero modes are localized at the opposite sides of the sixth dimension . </S>",
    "<S> the two fermion generations are distinguished by localizing the higgs doublet around @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives automatically rise to the desired mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> a non - trivial flavour mixing also comes out naturally and does not need any additional structure beyond the minimal one . </S>",
    "<S> such a mixing is related to a soft breaking of the six dimensional parity symmetry . in particular , in the quark sector of our toy model , the empirical relation @xmath6 can be easily accommodated . </S>",
    "<S> the essence of our proposal is to address within a unique higher dimensional framework both the problem of fermion replica and that of flavour symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the model described in the next sections represents a concrete step towards the realization of such a program .    </S>",
    "<S> we want to identify the different fermion generations with the appropriate components of a higher dimensional fermion . </S>",
    "<S> a five dimensional ( 5d ) fermion contains two 4d components with opposite chirality . after projecting out the wrong chirality </S>",
    "<S> we are thus left with a single generation . in 6d fermions </S>",
    "<S> can be chiral and a 6d chiral fermion has the same content of a 5d fermion . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest conceivable case where two replica with the same 4d chirality are present is that of a 6d vector - like fermion and we will adopt this choice to build a toy model with two fermion generations . to this purpose we consider two extra spatial dimensions compactified on the orbifold @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is the torus defined by @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath4 is the parity symmetry @xmath10 . as fundamental region of the orbifold we can take , for instance , the rectangle @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are four inequivalent fixed points under @xmath4 . in the chosen fundamental region </S>",
    "<S> they can be identified with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> our theory is invariant under the gauge group su(3)@xmath17su(2)@xmath17u(1 ) . to justify the use of 6d vector - like fermions as building blocks of our model </S>",
    "<S> , we also ask invariance under 6d parity to start with . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian has 6d vector - like fermions @xmath18 @xmath19 , one for each irreducible representation of the sm , as summarized in table 1 . with this set of fermion fields , </S>",
    "<S> our model is automatically free from 6d gauge anomalies . as we will see later on , </S>",
    "<S> requiring exact 6d parity symmetry is too strong an assumption to obtain a ` realistic ' fermion spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> although eventually we will relax this assumption , for the time being we carry on our construction by enforcing 6d parity invariance .    </S>",
    "<S> .vector - like 6d fermions and their gauge quantum numbers . </S>",

    "<S> we recall that , up to the @xmath25 dependence , a 6d vector - like spinor is equivalent to a pair of 4d dirac spinors : @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover each 6d fermion can be split into two chiralities @xmath27 , eigenstates of @xmath28 : @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a representation for the dirac matrices in 6d where @xmath30 ( see the appendix ) , where @xmath31 is the third pauli matrix , so that in terms of 4d chiralities we have : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> all fields are assumed to be periodic in @xmath36 and @xmath37 . by inspecting the kinetic terms </S>",
    "<S> , we see that consistency with the orbifold projection requires a non - trivial assignment of the @xmath4 parity . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath38 @xmath39 even under @xmath4 and @xmath40 @xmath9 @xmath4-odd . in the fermion sector </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath41 and @xmath42 should have the same @xmath4 parity , which should be opposite for @xmath41 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath44 equal to @xmath45 for @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for @xmath48 . at this level </S>",
    "<S> the zero modes are the gauge vector bosons of the standard model and two independent chiral fermions for each irreducible representation of the standard model , describing two massless generations . </S>",
    "<S> there are no gauge anomalies in our model . </S>",
    "<S> bulk anomalies are absent because the 6d fermions are vector - like . </S>",
    "<S> there could be gauge 4d anomalies localized at the four orbifold fixed points @xcite . in our model based on @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the anomalies are the same at each fixed point and they actually vanish with the quantum number assignments of table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed they are proportional to the anomalies of the 4d zero modes , which form two complete fermion generations , thus providing full 4d anomaly cancellation . </S>",
    "<S> fermion masses in six dimension and yukawa couplings do not modify this conclusion .    in the absence of additional interactions , </S>",
    "<S> each zero mode is constant with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> even by introducing a 6d ( parity invariant ) yukawa interaction between fermions and a higgs electroweak doublet , we do not break the 4d flavor symmetry , which is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> the first step to distinguish the two fermion generations is to localize them in different regions of the compact space . in our model </S>",

    "<S> modulo a relabelling among first and second generations , this gives rise to a perfect alignment of mass matrices and a vanishing overall mixing . to overcome this problem </S>",
    "<S> , we should relax the assumption of exact 6d parity symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that 6d parity is broken ` softly ' , by the fermion - background interaction described by @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by taking complex values for the mass coefficients @xmath50 . ) . </S>",
    "<S> only the second one is correct . ] in a fundamental theory such a breaking could be spontaneous : if @xmath49 were complex fields , then the lagrangian would still be invariant under 6d parity acting as @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> it might occur that the dynamics of the fields @xmath49 led to complex vevs for @xmath49 , thus spontaneously breaking parity . in our toy model </S>",
    "<S> we will simply assume the existence of such a complex background . </S>",
    "<S> all the relations that we have derived hold true for the complex case as well and we have now hierarchical mass matrices with a non - trivial intergenerational mixing . by expanding the results at leading order in @xmath79 we find : m_c = y_u v c_u-   m_s = y_d v c_d-   m_=y_e v c_e-  , and = _ 1 _ 2   = _ 1 _ 3   = _ 4 _ 5  . </S>",
    "<S> [ mom ] finally , after absorbing residual phases in the definition of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 4d fields , the matrices @xmath88 and @xmath89 are diagonalized by orthogonal transformations characterized by mixing angles @xmath90 : _ u , d= _ 1  , [ ma ] still at leading order in @xmath79 . therefore the cabibbo angle is given by : _ </S>",
    "<S> c=(- ) _ 1  . [ ca ] </S>",
    "<S> barring accidental cancellations in the relevant combinations of the coefficients @xmath74 , the cabibbo angle is of order @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> then , by assuming @xmath92 and @xmath93 we reproduce the correct order of magnitude of mass ratios in the quark sector . </S>",
    "<S> these are small numbers in the 4d theory , but can be obtained quite naturally from the 6d point of view : @xmath94 and @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , by taking @xmath96 we can naturally fit the lepton mass ratio </S>",
    "<S> .    it can be useful to comment about the way flavour symmetry is broken in this toy model . </S>",
    "<S> before the introduction of the yukawa interactions and modulo u(1 ) anomalies , the flavour symmetry group is u(2)@xmath97 . after turning the yukawa couplings on , we can consider several limits . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath98 , the quantities @xmath77 vanish and the flavour symmetry is broken down to u(1)@xmath97 , acting non - trivially on the lightest sector . if @xmath99 is finite and non - vanishing , u(1)@xmath97 is in turn completely broken down by @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , contrary to what happens in models with abelian flavour symmetries , the coefficients of order one that multiply the symmetry breaking parameters @xmath77 are now related one to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this can be appreciated by taking the limit @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath102 and the residual flavour symmetry is a permutation symmetry , separately for the lepton and the quark sectors : @xmath103 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now briefly comment about neutrino masses and mixings in this set - up . </S>",
    "<S> the most straightforward way to produce neutrino masses is to add a gauge singlet 6d fermion field , @xmath104 , with @xmath4 assignments @xmath47 . as for the case of charged fermions , by introducing a mass term for @xmath104 as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lm ] ) and a yukawa interaction with @xmath105 and @xmath106 as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ly ] ) , we obtain a dirac neutrino mass term m_= v ( ) a large mixing angle in the leptonic sector , @xmath107 , is obtained for @xmath108 , in which case the neutrino mass hierarchy , = _ 4 _ 6  , is controlled by @xmath109 . at leading order , the left mixings in @xmath110 and @xmath111 correspond to 2_e , =  , so that @xmath112 is naturally large . as in 4d </S>",
    "<S> , the smallness of these dirac neutrino masses with respect to the electroweak scale has to be imposed by an ad hoc suppression of the yukawa couplings @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> a natural suppression could be achieved by considering also a majorana mass term in the bulk for the field @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could write localized majorana mass terms directly on the 4d brane or even exploit a seventh warped extra - dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our 6d toy model is non renormalizable . </S>",
    "<S> it is characterized by some typical mass scale @xmath2 . at energies larger than this typical scale , </S>",
    "<S> the description offered by the model is not accurate enough and some other theory should replace it . up to now we have not specified @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we could have in mind a traditional picture where @xmath2 is very large , perhaps close to the 4d planck scale , where presumably all particle interactions , including the gravitational one , are unified in a fundamental theory . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> we have the usual hierarchy problem . </S>",
    "<S> clearly our simple model can not explain why @xmath114 and we should rely on some additional mechanism to render the electroweak breaking scale much smaller compared to @xmath2 . a supersymmetric or warped version of our toy model could alleviate the technical aspect of the hierarchy problem . alternatively , we could ask how small could @xmath2 be without producing a conflict with experimental data . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the two radii @xmath115 , @xmath99 are approximately of the same order @xmath116 . due to the different dimension between 6d and 4d fields , coupling constants of the effective 4d theory </S>",
    "<S> are suppressed by volume factors and we require @xmath117 to work in a weakly coupled regime . therefore , lower bounds on @xmath118 are also lower bounds for @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> lower bounds on @xmath118 come from the search of the first kaluza - klein modes at the existing colliders or from indirect effects induced by the additional heavy modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these last effects lead to departures from the sm predictions in electroweak observables . from the precision tests of the electroweak sector , </S>",
    "<S> we get a lower bound on @xmath118 in the @xmath119 range . however , the most dangerous indirect effects are those leading to violations of universality in gauge interactions and those contributing to flavour changing processes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , whenever we have a source of flavour symmetry breaking , we expect a violation of universality at some level . in the sm such violation </S>",
    "<S> comes through loop effects from the yukawa couplings and it is tiny . in our model , as we will see , such effects can already arise at tree level and , to respect the experimental bounds , a sufficiently large scale @xmath118 is needed @xcite .    since in each fermion sector the two generations </S>",
    "<S> are described by two copies of the same wave function , differing only in their localization along @xmath37 , the universality of the gauge interactions will be guaranteed if the gauge vector bosons have a wave function perfectly constant in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case only for massless gauge vector bosons , such as the photon , but , as we will see now , not necessarily for the massive gauge vector bosons like @xmath120 and @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , also the higher kaluza - klein modes of all gauge bosons have non - constant wave functions and their interactions with split fermions are in general non - universal .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by discussing the interactions between the lightest fermion generations and the observed @xmath120 and @xmath121 vector bosons . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for simplicity , the limit of vanishing gauge coupling @xmath122 for @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> then the free equation of motion for the gauge bosons @xmath124 of @xmath125 reads : w_+ h^2(x_6 ) w_=0  , [ gvb ] where @xmath126 denotes the @xmath37-dependent vev of the higgs doublet @xmath65 . to avoid problems in dealing with singular , ill - defined functions , here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath126 is a smooth function , vev of a 6d bulk field . from the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gvb ] ) we will see that , if @xmath126 is not constant , then the lightest mode for the gauge vector bosons is no longer described by a constant wave function . therefore the 4d gauge interactions , resulting from the overlap of fermion and vector bosons wave functions , can be different for the two generations .    </S>",
    "<S> in general we are not able to solve the above equation exactly , but we can do this by a perturbative expansion in @xmath127 , which we could justify a posteriori . at zeroth order the @xmath128 mass and the corresponding wave function </S>",
    "<S> are given by : ( m^(0)_w)^2=0   w^(0)_=  . at first order </S>",
    "<S> we find : m_w^2&= & _ 0^+r_6 dx_6   h^2(x_6 ) + w_&=&w^(0)_(1+w_(x_6 ) ) + w_(x_6)&=&_0^x_6du_0^u dz ( h^2(z)-m_w^2 )  , [ wf ] modulo an arbitrary additive constant in @xmath124 , that can be adjusted by normalization . </S>",
    "<S> we see that when @xmath126 is constant , the usual result is reproduced : @xmath129 and the corresponding wave function does not depend on @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ wf ] ) allows us to compute the fractional difference @xmath130 between the su(2 ) couplings to the first and second fermion generation , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on @xmath131 , we obtain : =  , [ rg ] where @xmath46 . as expected , if @xmath132 is @xmath37-constant , then the gauge couplings are universal . from the precision tests of the sm performed in the last decade at lep and slc we expect that such a difference should not exceed , </S>",
    "<S> say , the per - mill level . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed numerically eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rg ] ) for several choices of the parameters and for several possible profiles of the vev @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that universality is respected at the per - mill level for @xmath133 or @xmath134 .    </S>",
    "<S> much more severe are the bounds associated to the interactions of the higher modes arising from the kaluza - klein decomposition of the gauge vector bosons : a_=i _ c , m , n t^c a_^c ( m , n)(x ) z_mn(x_5,x_6 )  , [ kkg ] where @xmath135 are the generators of the gauge group factor , @xmath136 the corresponding 4d vector bosons and @xmath137 the periodic , @xmath4-even wave functions : z_mn(x_5,x_6)= ( m+n )  . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kkg ] ) @xmath138 and @xmath139 are integers : @xmath138 runs from @xmath140 to @xmath141 for positive @xmath142 and from @xmath143 to @xmath141 for @xmath144 . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lg ] ) we obtain the 4d interaction term : - _ a , b_m , n </S>",
    "<S> c_ab^mn   ^t^c   f^()_b(x )   a_^c ( m , n)(x )  , [ hint ] where @xmath145 denotes the gauge coupling constant of the relevant group factor and the scale @xmath2 has been included to make @xmath145 dimensionless . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath146 @xmath147 describe the overlap among the fermion and gauge - boson wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : c_ab^mn&=&0  m0 + c_ab^0n&=&0  ab + c_11 ^ 0n&= & + c_22 ^ 0n&=&(-1)^n c_11 ^ 0n [ hcoef ] for odd @xmath142 , the interactions mediated by @xmath148 are non - universal . by asking that universality holds within the experimental limits , we get a lower bound on @xmath118 similar to that discussed before , of the order of some @xmath119 </S>",
    "<S> . however , stronger bounds are obtained from the interactions in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hint],[hcoef ] ) , by considering their contribution to flavour changing processes . indeed , after electroweak symmetry breaking </S>",
    "<S> , we should account for the unitary transformations bringing fermions from the interaction basis to the mass eigenstate basis . </S>",
    "<S> the terms involving @xmath149 are not invariant under such transformations and flavour changing interactions are produced . by integrating out the heavy modes </S>",
    "<S> @xmath149 we obtain an effective , low - energy description of flavour violation in terms of four - fermion operators , suppressed by the square of the compactification scale , @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> the most relevant effects of these operators have been discussed by delgado , pomarol and quiros in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in a context which is very close to the one we are considering here . by analyzing the contribution to @xmath151 and to @xmath152 </S>",
    "<S> , these authors derived a lower bound on @xmath118 of @xmath153 and of @xmath154 , respectively , which at least as an order of magnitude applies also to our model . </S>",
    "<S> we have presented and analyzed a model for flavour in two extra dimensions . for each irreducible representation of the sm </S>",
    "<S> , there is a single , vector - like 6d fermion . </S>",
    "<S> four dimensional fermion generations arise from orbifold projection in the compactification mechanism . in the toy model discussed here </S>",
    "<S> there is only room for two generations and a natural question is whether this approach can be generalized to the realistic case of three generations . </S>",
    "<S> the obvious objection is that the number of 4d components of a higher dimensional fermion is a power of two . in principle , an odd number of massless modes can be obtained by eliminating some of the unwanted components via orbifold projection and/or non - periodic boundary conditions . in our model flavour symmetry </S>",
    "<S> is broken in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , the independent zero modes are localized at different points along the sixth dimension by means of a generalized 6d mass term , described by a scalar background . </S>",
    "<S> our background is topologically trivial and does not modify the number of zero modes , which is fixed by the orbifold projection . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of a background with a non - trivial topology may change the number of chiral zero modes , thus contributing to reproduce the realistic case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the flavour symmetry is then broken by turning on standard yukawa interaction with a higgs field developing a non - constant vev . in the model explored here the geometry of the compact space </S>",
    "<S> is the simplest one and it is essentially one dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> the generations are localized along the sixth dimension , and the fifth dimension does not play any active role . in a more realistic model </S>",
    "<S> it might be necessary to fully exploit the geometry of the compact space , in order to obtain a successful arrangement for the zero modes . a specific problem is represented by the neutrino sector , that we have only briefly touched here . </S>",
    "<S> another unpleasant feature of our toy model is that , despite its simplicity , it contains too many parameters and there are no testable predictions . clearly </S>",
    "<S> the issue of predictability is crucial for a realistic model . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that , by going to the realistic case of three generations , the number of parameters does not increase , thus allowing for quantitative tests of this approach . alternatively , we could consider more constrained frameworks . </S>",
    "<S> a possibility could be to exploit a grand unification symmetry to limit the number of parameters in the fermion sector . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting case is represented by theories where the higgs fields are identified with the extra components of higher dimensional gauge vector bosons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main problems of these models is precisely to break flavour symmetry , starting from universal yukawa couplings , universality being dictated by gauge invariance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach could provide a possible mechanism to realize such breaking .    despite the fact that our model is incomplete in many respects , </S>",
    "<S> we think that it possesses several interesting theoretical properties . at variance with most of the existing 4d models , </S>",
    "<S> the problem of flavour symmetry breaking is here tightly related to the problem of obtaining the right number of generations . </S>",
    "<S> starting from dimensionless parameters of order one , we were able to obtain a hierarchical pattern of masses . </S>",
    "<S> they are described by mass matrices that are very close in structure to those obtained in 4d models by enforcing abelian flavour symmetries , and provide a successful description of both quark and lepton spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial difference is that , whereas in the 4d case , the order - one coefficients multiplying powers of the symmetry breaking parameters are completely undetermined , in our case those coefficients are strongly correlated and predictable in terms of the underlying parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have also a quite non - standard interpretation of the intergenerational mixing , that appears to be related to a soft breaking of 6d parity symmetry . starting from vector - like 6d fermions transforming as a sm generation , we automatically obtain cancellation of bulk and localized gauge anomalies , a rather non - trivial result in 6d gauge theories . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully some of these features could also become part of a more realistic framework .    </S>",
