    "for large classes of dynamical systems with good mixing properties , it is possible to obtain strong statistical limit laws such as the central limit theorems and its refinements including the almost sure invariance principle ( asip )  @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of the asip is the weak invariance principle ( wip ) which is the focus of this paper .",
    "thus the standard wip ( weak convergence to brownian motion ) holds for general axiom  a diffeomorphisms and flows , and also for nonuniformly hyperbolic maps and flows modelled by young towers  @xcite with square integrable return time function ( including hnon - like attractors  @xcite , finite horizon lorentz gases  @xcite , and the lorenz attractor  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there has been interest in statistical limit laws for dynamical systems with weaker mixing properties such as those modelled by a young tower where the return time function is not square integrable . in the borderline case where the return time lies in @xmath2 for all @xmath3 ,",
    "it is often possible to prove a central limit theorem with nonstandard norming ( nonstandard domain of attraction of the normal distribution ) .",
    "this includes important examples such as the infinite horizon lorentz gas  @xcite , the bunimovich stadium  @xcite and billiards with cusps  @xcite . in such cases , it is also possible to obtain the corresponding wip ( see for example  @xcite ) .    for young towers with non - square - integrable return time function , the central limit theorem generally fails .",
    "gouzel  @xcite ( see also zweimller  @xcite ) obtained definitive results on convergence in distribution to stable laws .",
    "the only available results on the corresponding wip are due to tyran - kamiska  @xcite who gives necessary and sufficient conditions for weak convergence to the appropriate stable lvy process in the standard skorohod @xmath0 topology  @xcite .",
    "however in the situations we are interested in , the @xmath0 topology is too strong and the results in  @xcite prove that weak convergence fails in this topology .    in this paper",
    ", we repair the situation by working with the @xmath1 topology ( also introduced by skorohod  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we give general conditions for systems modelled by a young tower , whereby convergence in distribution to a stable law can be improved to weak convergence in the @xmath1 topology to the corresponding lvy process .",
    "the proof is by inducing ( see  @xcite for proofs by inducing of convergence in distribution ) .",
    "young towers by definition have a good inducing system , namely a gibbs - markov map ( a markov map with bounded distortion and big images  @xcite ) .",
    "the results of tyran - kamiska  @xcite often apply positively for such induced maps ( see for example the proof of theorem  [ thm - const ] below ) and yield weak convergence in the @xmath0 topology , and hence the @xmath1 topology , for the induced system .",
    "the main theoretical result of the present paper discusses how @xmath1 convergence in an induced system lifts to the original system ( even when convergence in the @xmath0 topology does not lift ) .    as a special case ,",
    "we recover the aforementioned results  @xcite on the wip in the nonstandard domain of attraction of the normal distribution .    in the remainder of the introduction ,",
    "we describe how our results apply to pomeau - manneville intermittency maps  @xcite .",

    "since the jumps in @xmath18 are bounded by @xmath21 , it is evident that in theorem  [ thm - lsv ] convergence can not hold in the @xmath0 topology .",

    "an immediate consequence is the wip : @xmath26 converges weakly to brownian motion .    if @xmath27 and @xmath16 , then gouzel  @xcite proved that @xmath23 is in the nonstandard domain of attraction of the normal distribution : @xmath28 converges in distribution to a normal distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath29 .",
