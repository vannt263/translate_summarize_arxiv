    "the real and virtual photoproduction of large-@xmath0 particles gives rise to interesting tests of the qcd dynamics and enables to measure the parton distribution and fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "in particular it offers a unique opportunity to measure the parton distributions in the ( real or virtual ) photon . in this paper",
    "i shall concentrate on this feature of photoproduction reactions . in the first part ,",
    "i assess the possibility to determine the gluon distribution in a real photon by measuring the photoproduction of large-@xmath0 photons , and in the second part , i study the importance of the virtual photon structure function in the forward ( along the initial proton direction ) production of large -@xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "this latter reaction is also interesting from the point of view of the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "in fact it has been proposed by mueller @xcite in order to study the importance of the bfkl contribution to the forward cross section .",
    "over the past years , the zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite collaborations at hera have been able to observe the photoproduction of large@xmath3 photons , and the comparisons of data with existing nlo qcd prdictions @xcite appear successful . in photoproduction reactions ,",
    "a quasi - real photon , emitted at small angle from the electron , interacts with a parton from the proton .",
    "the photon can either participate directly in the hard scattering or be resolved into a partonic system , in which case the parton stemming from the photon takes part in the hard interaction .",
    "therefore photoproduction is a privileged reaction to measure or constrain the parton distributions in the photon and in the proton . here",
    "i will put the emphasize on the gluon distribution in the real photon , a distribution which is hardly known @xcite .",
    "the interest of the reaction @xmath4 comes from the fact that the final photon offers a clear experimental signal . on the theoretical side",
    ", this cross section is hardly sensitive to the factorization and renormalization scales , a fact which should allow us an accurate determination of the parton distributions .    as observables which serve to reconstruct the longitudinal momentum fraction of the parton stemming from the photon , it is common to use [ 1e ] x_obs^ = p_t^  e^-^ + e_t^jet  e^-^jet 2 e^  .",
    "however , as the measurement of @xmath5 can be a substantial source of systematic errors at low @xmath6 values , we propose a slightly different variable which does not depend on @xmath5 , [ 2e ] x_ll^ = p_t^ ( e^-^ + e^-^jet ) 2 e^  .    at leading order , for the non - fragmentation contribution , the variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 coincide , and they are also equal to the `` true '' partonic longitudinal momentum fraction , i.e. the argument of the parton distribution function . at nlo ,",
    "the real corrections involve 3 partons in the final state ( with transverse momenta @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , one of which  say parton 5  is unobserved . therefore , @xmath12 and @xmath13 will be different at nlo .    before presenting numerical results ,",
    "let us further discuss the problem of the cuts on the photon and jet transverse momenta .",
    "it is well known that symmetrical cuts on the minimum transverse energies of the photon and of the jet should be avoided as they amount to including a region where the fixed order perturbative calculation shows infrared sensitivity . as explained in detail in @xcite , the problem stems from terms @xmath14 which become large as @xmath15 approaches @xmath16 , the lower cut on the jet transverse energy .",
    "therefore the partonic nlo cross section has a singular behaviour at @xmath17 .",
    "obviously , @xmath18 will not exhibit a problem as long as @xmath19 since the critical point @xmath20 will not be reached in this case .    on the other hand , one often would like to have a more inclusive cross section such as @xmath21 , obtained by integrating the differential cross section over @xmath15 and @xmath5 . in this case",
    "one should not choose @xmath22 as this amounts to integrating the spectrum over the @xmath23 contribution .",
    "as a result , the theoretical prediction although being finite , is infrared sensitive as a consequence of choosing symmetrical cuts . this point has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .    , and @xmath24  gev , @xmath25  gev.,width=307,height=307 ]",
    "our studies are based on the program ephox @xcite , which is a nlo partonic monte carlo event generator . unless stated otherwise , we use the following input for our numerical results  : a center of mass energy @xmath26  gev with @xmath27  gev and @xmath28  gev is used .",
    "the cuts on the minimum transverse energies of photon and jet are @xmath24  gev , @xmath29  gev .",
    "the rapidities have been integrated over in the domain @xmath30 unless stated otherwise . for the parton distributions in the proton",
    "we take the mrst01 parametrization , for the photon we use afg04 @xcite distribution functions and bfg @xcite fragmentation functions .",
    "we take @xmath31  flavours , and for @xmath32 we use an exact solution of the two - loop renormalization group equation , and not an expansion in @xmath33 .",
    "the default scale choice is @xmath34 .",
    "jets are defined using the @xmath35-algorithm .",
    "the rapidities refer to the @xmath36 laboratory frame , with the hera convention that the proton is moving towards positive rapidity .",
    "one must also note that the final photon verifies an isolation criterion @xcite .",
    "the main result of the study is shown in fig .  1 which details the various contributions to the cross section",
    ".    the gluon distribution @xmath37 only contributes at small values of @xmath38 , corresponding to large values of @xmath39 , and we shall try , by various cuts , to enhance the relative contribution of this component .",
    "cuts in the photon and jet rapidities are quite effective to enhance the gluon in the photon , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in the presence of forward rapidity cuts.,width=297,height=384 ]    note that the lower cuts on the transverse momenta are rather large , @xmath29  gev , @xmath24  gev .",
    "one can increase the cross section by choosing lower @xmath40 cuts , as shown in fig .",
    "this figure also shows the scale dependence of @xmath41 in the presence of the cuts @xmath42 , @xmath43 respectively @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the behaviour of the cross section @xmath46 , varies by @xmath47  % under the scale changes .",
    "one must keep in mind that the distribution @xmath48 is poorly known and that a determination of the latter with an accuracy of @xmath49  % would be quite welcome .",
    "this reaction has been put forward by mueller @xcite to observe the bfkl dynamics . in fact in the collision between the virtual photon of virtuality @xmath50 and a gluon from the incident proton , we can have the reaction @xmath51 with @xmath52 gluons emitted in the final state by a ladder of gluons exchanged between the @xmath53-pair and the initial gluon . in the configuration in which the large@xmath3 forward @xmath1 is a fragment of the first ( closest to the proton ) gluon , we have a gluonic ladder , starting at virtuality @xmath54 and ending at the virtuality @xmath55 . when @xmath56 , there is no room for a dglap evolution .",
    "however , when @xmath57 is small , the @xmath58 terms generated by the latter can be resumed by the bfkl equation @xcite  ; this leads to a large contribution to the forward cross section if we follow the estimations of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we follow another way and calculate the electroproduction cross section at the nlo approximation .",
    "the cross section is the sum of a direct term and of a resolved term . for both of them",
    ", we calculate ho corrections the parton distributions in the virtual photon also are calculated at the nlo approximation @xcite .",
    "this cross section has been measured by the h1 collaboration @xcite and we here present results for @xmath59 @xcite which verifies the following constraints . in the laboratory system a @xmath1 is observed in the forward direction with @xmath60  ; the laboratory momentum of the pion is constrained by @xmath61 and an extra cut is put on the @xmath1 transverse momentum in the @xmath62 center of mass system  : @xmath63  2.5 gev .",
    "the inelasticity @xmath64 is restricted to the range @xmath65 , where @xmath66  gev)@xmath67 .",
    "we use @xmath68  mev and the fragmentation functions of ref .",
    "all the factorization and renormalization scales are taken equal to @xmath69 .",
    "the direct ho corrections from which the ( lowest order ) resolved part is subtracted are called ho@xmath70 .        in fig .  4 we notice the importance of the ho@xmath70 corrections to the direct born cross section .",
    "these large corrections come from the subprocesses @xmath71 and @xmath72 that have a gluon exchanged in the @xmath73-channel .",
    "we also notice the importance of the resolved contribution ( approximately one half of the total cross section ) with large ho corrections  : ho ( resolved)/born ( resolved ) @xmath74 .",
    "all these large corrections are associated to small values of @xmath75 due to the small cut @xmath76  gev . as a consequence",
    "the total cross section is quite sensitive to variation of the renormalization scale @xmath77 @xcite . for the choice",
    "@xmath78 we obtain a good agreement between data and theory with little room left for a bfkl contribution as estimated in ref .",
