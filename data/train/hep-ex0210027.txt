    "one of the biggest challenges in our understanding of qcd is the nature of colour singlet exchange or _ diffractive _ interactions .",

    "the point - like virtual photon probes the structure of colour singlet exchange , similarly to inclusive dis probing proton structure .",
    "l0.5    at hera , around @xmath1 of low @xmath2 events are diffractive @xcite .",
    "experimentally , such events are identified by either tagging the elastically scattered proton in _ roman pot _",
    "spectrometers @xmath3 downstream from the interaction point or by asking for a large rapidity gap without particle production between the central hadronic system and the proton beam direction .    a diagram of diffractive dis is shown in fig .  [ feyn ] .",
    "a virtual photon coupling to the beam electron interacts diffractively with the proton through the exchange of a colour singlet and produces a hadronic system @xmath4 with mass @xmath5 in the final state .",
    "if the 4-momenta of the incoming ( outgoing ) electron and proton are labeled @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) respectively , the following kinematic variables can be defined : @xmath10 , the photon virtuality ; @xmath11 , the longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck quark relative to the diffractive exchange ; @xmath12 , the fractional proton momentum taken by the diffractive exchange and @xmath13 , the 4-momentum squared transferred at the proton vertex .",

    "if the outgoing proton is not detected , the measurements are integrated over @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "the proof @xcite that qcd hard scattering factorization is valid for diffractive dis justifies the expression of @xmath19 , at fixed @xmath15 and @xmath26 , as a convolution of diffractive proton parton distributions ( dpdf s ) @xmath28 and partonic cross sections @xmath29 : @xmath30 the @xmath28 should obey the dglap evolution equations and the @xmath31 are the same as for standard dis . in consequence , the framework of nlo qcd can be applied to diffractive dis in a similar way as to inclusive dis .",
    "an extra assumption which is often made is that the @xmath32 dependence of @xmath33 can be factored out ( regge factorization ) into a _ pomeron flux factor _ @xmath34 : @xmath35 which is often parameterised using regge phenomenology as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the pomeron trajectory with intercept @xmath38 .",

    "zeus has studied @xcite the cross section dependence on the azimuthal angle @xmath51 between the electron and proton scattering planes , which is sensitive to the longitudinal cross section @xmath56 via the interference between transverse and longitudinal photon induced contributions , which introduces an asymmetry in @xmath51 .",
    "the measured asymmetries are small and , within the present statistical uncertainties , compatible with zero .      by making fits to the @xmath15 dependence of the diffractive dis data using eqs .",

    "the diffractive data suggest an increase of @xmath38 with @xmath42 and are significantly higher than the soft pomeron value for @xmath59",
    ". however , the naive expectation that the diffractive cross section grows twice as fast with energy as the inclusive one , corresponding to @xmath60 , is hard to reconcile with the present data at high @xmath42 .",

    "taking out the factorising @xmath15 dependence , the same behaviour is observed at different @xmath15 : at low @xmath43 , the logarithmic @xmath42 dependences of @xmath33 and @xmath62 are very similar , indicating that the ratio of the diffractive to the total proton gluon density is approximately constant in this region .",
    "by contrast , at the highest @xmath63 , the logarithmic @xmath42 derivative becomes negative , suggestive of the presence of @xmath42-suppressed higher twist contributions to @xmath33 for @xmath64 .",
    "however , this behaviour can also be explained by dglap evolution due to the the kinematic limit @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) for gluon radiation in the case of @xmath33 .",
    "h1 has presented @xcite a new nlo dglap qcd fit to the diffractive reduced cross section data , from which diffractive parton densities are determined .",

    "the diffractive pdf s remain large up to large fractional momenta @xmath68 ( or @xmath43 ) and are dominated by the gluon distribution . in total @xmath69 of the exchange momentum is carried by gluons at @xmath70 . to test factorization ,",
    "the dpdf s can be used for updated comparisons with diffractive final state data from hera and the tevatron @xcite .",
    "several new high precision data sets of inclusive diffractive dis have recently become available . in the case of the rapidity gap method ,",
    "the data are now systematically limited at low @xmath42 .",
    "these data are very useful to constrain the free parameters of qcd motivated models ( e.g. dipole models ) for diffractive dis and to distinguish between different approaches .",
    "in particular , they have been used for the determination of a new generation of diffractive parton distributions  including their uncertainties  in the framework of nlo qcd , enabling tests of qcd factorization as applied to diffraction by comparisons with final state cross sections ."
