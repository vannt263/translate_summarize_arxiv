    "classical rainich theory is concerned with studying conditions under which a given energy - momentum tensor in four dimensions can be constructed from a maxwell field . the algebraic part , which here will be called the algebraic rainich conditions , gives necessary and sufficient constraints on when a given energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 can be constructed from a 2-form , i.e. , when there exists a 2-form @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "the conditions , first found by rainich  @xcite , are @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8    the last condition is usually called the dominant energy condition , and it can be replaced by some other energy condition . using einstein s equations and the fact that @xmath3 is trace - free , one may replace @xmath3 by the ricci curvature tensor @xmath9 in these equations .",
    "then one obtains necessary and sufficient conditions on a four dimensional lorentzian geometry to correspond ( algebraically ) to an einstein - maxwell spacetime . for @xmath4 to satisfy maxwell s equations , one also adds a differential condition on @xmath3 or @xmath9 .",
    "this view of geometrising physical situations , without going to higher dimension than four , was especially developed by misner and wheeler  @xcite .",
    "the theory is well developed for four dimensions and 2-forms but conditions have also been developed for massless scalar fields and some other physical situations ( see  @xcite for many references ) .",
    "it is of interest to generalise the results to other cases and higher dimensions for several reasons .",
    "some gravitation theories live in higher dimensions and can therefore not make use of the classical algebraic rainich conditions .",
    "it can also shed some light on the four dimensional case by considering what happens when the number of dimensions is different than four , thereby showing what is special to four dimensions .",
    "another reason is that there is some nice mathematics to be discovered .    in bergqvist and senovilla  @xcite superenergy tensors of simple forms in arbitrary dimension",
    "were examined .",
    "one of the results found is that the square of the superenergy tensor of any simple form is proportional to the metric .",
    "conversely , it was also shown that if the square of a symmetric tensor is proportional to the metric , then the tensor is , up to sign , the superenergy tensor of a simple @xmath2-form .",
    "furthermore , the trace of the tensor determines the value of @xmath2 , i.e. , what kind of form that can be used to construct the superenergy tensor",
    ". these results therefore give a complete generalisation of the classical algebraic rainich theory in the case the condition @xmath10 is preserved .",
    "as the energy - momentum tensors of maxwell fields and massless scalar fields are special cases of superenergy tensors of @xmath2-forms , it seems that superenergy tensors are the natural objects to consider when a more general algebraic rainich theory is sought .    in this paper",
    "we will regain these results and extend considerations to non - simple forms .",
    "the problem is naturally divided into two parts .",
    "the first part is to find a necessary identity , which replaces @xmath10 , for the superenergy tensor .",
    "the second part is to show that this identity is the best possible for that case , or even better , show that the condition together with the energy condition is sufficient .    the first part will be done by antisymmetrising over the indices of the forms involved . in that process , and even in later cases , it turns out that the metric structure is not relevant",
    ". therefore those parts will be presented without the metric structure of the vector space .",
    "the metric structure is however crucial for the converse and we will be mainly interested in real vector spaces with lorentz signature . in this case",
    "we obtain complete results for 2-forms of rank 4 in arbitrary dimension . from this",
    "we immediately find the necessary and sufficient conditions for an energy - momentum tensor in five dimensions to originate in a 2-form , which is a complete generalisation of the classical algebraic rainich theory to five dimensions .",
    "we also discuss cases of higher rank of the 2-form and @xmath2-forms with @xmath11 .",
    "however , it could also be interesting to work out the converse for other signatures , e.g. , with a positive definite metric .",
    "the first step would have to be to find a replacement of the dominant energy condition .",
    "in section  [ section : notation ] we present some notation , basic definitions , and a theorem for lorentz metrics corresponding to the spectral theorem for positive definite metrics . in section",
    "[ section : simple ] we use antisymmetrisation to study rainich theory for simple forms .",
    "then 2-forms of rank 4 are considered in section  [ section : frank4 ] , with some of the calculations presented in .",
    "more general forms are treated in sections  [ section : highrank ] and  [ section : pforms ] , and we finish with a discussion in section  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "in this paper we will use the abstract index notation .",
    "the letter @xmath12 will always refer to the number of dimensions . with a tensor we will mean a multilinear mapping on an @xmath12-dimensional vector space . if so preferred it can be seen as a tensor field taken pointwise on an @xmath12-dimensional manifold .",
    "when talking about @xmath13-tensors we will use an index free notation .",
    "thus @xmath0 will mean @xmath14 and @xmath1 will mean @xmath15 etc .",
    "the trace @xmath16 will be written as @xmath17 $ ] . in the context of tensors",
    "any scalar term will have an implicit identity mapping @xmath18 on it .",
    "due to preference the objects in the index free notation can instead of tensors be viewed as linear mappings with the product being composition , or as matrices with the product being matrix multiplication .",
    "the metric free parts are very general .",
    "the tensors can be taken over any finite dimensional vector space over any field of zero characteristic ( a sufficient condition for the results in this paper ) .",
    "occasionally we need to extend the field in order to solve for eigenvalues .",
    "the reader who so prefers , may just think of vector spaces over real numbers and extend that to complex numbers whenever necessary .",
    "whenever we talk about the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue we refer to its multiplicity as a solution of the characteristic equation , not its multiplicity as a solution of the equation at hand .",
    "the geometrical multiplicity refers to the dimension of the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue .",
    "a @xmath2-form @xmath19 is a tensor with @xmath2 indices that is totally antisymmetric .",
    "the _ rank _ of a @xmath2-form @xmath19 is the dimension of the subspace that is spanned by @xmath20 when the vectors @xmath21 varies .",
    "equivalently , the rank of a @xmath2-form @xmath19 is the lowest number of linearly independent ( dual-)vectors that must be used in order to construct the @xmath2-form .",
    "the @xmath2-form @xmath19 is _ simple _ if it is a product of 1-forms , i.e. , @xmath22}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 are 1-forms , and where the brackets @xmath24 $ ] denote the antisymmetric part .",
    "the superenergy tensor @xmath3 of a @xmath2-form @xmath25 , @xmath26 , is given by  @xcite @xmath27 if the metric @xmath28 is assumed to have ( lorentz ) signature @xmath29 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , for @xmath30 , this expression is equivalent to the original definition first presented by senovilla , also in  @xcite , which involves @xmath19 and its hodge dual .",
    "note that the @xmath2-form @xmath19 and its dual ( @xmath31)-form have the same superenergy tensors if @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "we would now like to have a definition that does not include the metric structure .",
    "raising the first index on @xmath0 makes the metric disappear from the definition .",
    "@xmath33 without a metric there is no way to relate @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "we use different letters for the two forms to emphasise this . in order to simplify things",
    "further we omit the non - zero coefficient since that will not affect the metric free part of this paper and will only rescale eigenvalues for the metric dependent parts .",
    "so , in this paper the _ superenergy tensor _ will be defined as @xmath36    the product of two @xmath2-forms @xmath19 and @xmath37 will be used frequently in this paper , so we introduce the notation @xmath38 thus the superenergy tensor can now be written @xmath39\\ ] ] using index - free notation .",
    "if the signature @xmath40 is used then the omitted coefficient has a sign that depends on @xmath2 and that will of course not just add a rescaling but will also change the sign of the eigenvalues .    whenever a metric is present",
    "we assume that @xmath19 and @xmath37 are equal relative to the metric .",
    "that implies that the superenergy tensor is symmetric relative to this metric , i.e. , @xmath41 .    the fact that @xmath0 is symmetric relative to a given metric says something about the structure of @xmath0 .",
    "exactly what it says depends on the metric .",
    "if the metric is positive definite in a real vector space then the spectral theorem says that there is a basis of orthogonal eigenvectors of @xmath0 .",
    "here we are mainly concerned with metrics with lorentz signature @xmath42 , and then the situation is a little bit more involved .",
    "the following theorem covers that case .",

    "the method of antisymmetrising over the indices of the forms gets more complicated for @xmath2-forms when @xmath184 . if we antisymmetrise over at least two indices on one form and over at least three forms then it happens that the indices that should contract with the indices of one form are spread out over three or more forms .",

    "other possibilities fail in the same way , i.e. , the forms can not be combined so that they can be written in terms of the product @xmath115 .",

    "this complication is not just a break down of the method of getting the identities by antisymmetrising but , as the following example shows , a complication in the structure of the product of the forms .",
    "assume we have a vector space over the real numbers and a metric with lorentz signature or a positive definite metric .",
    "let @xmath72 , @xmath187 be an orthonormalised basis with @xmath188 as the timelike base vector in the lorentz case .",

    "thus , this @xmath115 , and therefore the corresponding @xmath0 , can not satisfy a polynomial identity of lower order than six respectively seven .",
    "this example does of course not rule out the possibility of special cases where it might be possible to obtain something better than the identities   and  .",
    "the main point in this paper is to highlight the relation between identities from antisymmetrisation and rainich theory .",
    "we have shown how to obtain such identities in several cases and in some cases also shown that they are sharp in the sense that they , together with the dec , are sufficient conditions for those cases . in some other cases we have argued that there is no better algebraic identity without showing that everything which satisfies the particular identity is also a superenergy tensor of that type .    as we have seen in this paper",
    "the problem naturally divides into two parts : @xmath59 obtaining identities , and @xmath63 showing that the identity so obtained is the best possible or , even stronger , show that it characterises that class of superenergy tensors .",
    "it is interesting that the first part ( if the energy condition is not included ) is independent of the metric .",
    "the generalisations come `` for free '' once this fact is respected .",
    "nothing would have been simpler by restricting to real vector spaces with some special metric and assuming that @xmath19 and @xmath37 were equal with respect to that metric .",
    "actually , the absence of a metric prevents us from unnecessary raising or lowering indices and thereby helps us to avoid complicating the derivations unnecessarily .",
    "the antisymmetrisations that are the foundations for the identities have different roles in the identities obtained in this paper . in most cases",
    "the antisymmetrisation is over more indices than the rank of the tensors involved . on some occasions",
    "the number of indices that is antisymmetrised over is larger than the number of dimensions and the identities can thus be viewed as dimensionally dependent identities .",
    "when this happens it is not important that the indices antisymmetrised over belong to a particular tensor but can be on any tensor .",
    "normally this is used to replace one pair of forms by a delta and thus reducing the order of the final identity . however",
    ", when the rank of the tensors involved is strictly less than the number of dimensions there is nothing to gain from antisymmetrising over more indices just to get a dimensionally dependent identity .",
    "it is surprising that it is only the structure of one of the forms @xmath19 and @xmath37 , the simpler one if given a choice , that matters .",
    "the forms always have the same structure when constructing superenergy tensors so it is hard to see that this will have any practical impact .",
    "however , from a mathematical point of view it is interesting .",
    "a natural question to ask is if it is possible to find forms @xmath19 and @xmath37 for any tensor @xmath0 that satisfies any of the identities obtained in this paper .",
    "in other words , does the energy condition together with the symmetry assumption correspond to the requirement that @xmath19 and @xmath37 should be equal with respect to a given metric ?",
    "it is obvious that we get more tensors @xmath0 when @xmath19 and @xmath37 are aloud to be independent .",
    "one way to see this is to take any @xmath0 that satisfies the energy condition and then change sign on one of the forms .",
    "the new superenergy tensor so obtained does not satisfy the energy condition except in special cases .    however , there are tensors @xmath0 which satisfy an identity without being obtainable as a superenergy tensor .",
    "one such tensor in five dimensions is the one with a jordan - string of length three and all eigenvalues zero .",
    "the fact that the trace is zero implies that the tensor @xmath0 and the product of the forms are identical .",
    "this tensor satisfies the identity in theorem  [ th : rank4 ] but it does not satisfy the identity in theorem  [ th : simple ] so neither @xmath19 nor @xmath37 can be simple .",
    "this means that the forms must be 2-forms or 3-forms .",
    "those two cases are equivalent in five dimensions so we may assume 2-forms , which is also what we would expect since theorem  [ th : rank4 ] refers to 2-forms . since the 2-forms can not be simple they must both be of rank  4 which means that the dimension of the kernel is one .",
    "the kernel of the composition of these two forms , and thus the tensor @xmath0 , has at most dimension two .",
    "this is in contradiction with the assumed @xmath0 whose kernel has dimension three .",
    "another question which comes naturally is whether we could have avoided the dec in theorem  [ th : rank4rainich ] by allowing that either of @xmath194 is a superenergy tensor as was done in  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case here as is easy to see by considering , e.g. , the solution of equation   where all eigenvalues are zero and with one jordan - string of length three .",
    "this solution is compatible with a symmetric @xmath0 according to theorem  [ th : spectrallorentz ] .",
    "however , neither of @xmath194 is compatible with the dec according to theorem  [ th : spectrallorentzdec ] .",
    "we have seen that the complexity of the algebraic rainich theory increases with increasing dimension @xmath12 , and increasing rank of the @xmath2-forms .",
    "furthermore , we have not discussed the non - uniqueness problem ; how many forms can have the same superenergy tensor , a problem which has been solved in four dimensions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "there are indications that there is a higher degree of uniqueness if @xmath195 than if @xmath196 .",
