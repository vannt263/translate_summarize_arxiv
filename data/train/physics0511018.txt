    "traffic control in networks has a long history .",
    "early efforts have aimed at synchronizing traffic signals along a one - way , then a two - way arterial .",
    "there is still potential for improvement in this direction , as is attested by some recent research efforts @xcite or prompted by the development of new theoretical tools @xcite .",
    "synchronization of traffic along arterials results in so - called green - waves , the aim of which is simply to ensure that traffic flows smoothly along main streets .",
    "expected benefits of green waves are reduced fuel consumption and travel times .",
    "the green - wave approach can be generalized to networks , yielding pre - calculated signal control schemes , such as transyt @xcite . in principle",
    "such schemes are completely coercive : they force the traffic flow to comply with pre - calculated patterns , optimizing such criteria as the total travel time spent .",
    "since traffic demand varies , the need for some responsiveness of the signal control was felt very soon .",
    "the scoot system @xcite , an outgrowth of transyt , allows for smooth change in the signal settings in response to changes in the traffic demand .    among the strategies making use of precalculated controls ,",
    "let us mention scats @xcite , which relies on a library of controls ( green durations , offsets , ... ) according to traffic conditions .",
    "even the optimization criterion depends on the traffic state .",
    "the system might , at night , minimize the number of stops , maximize throughput at day time under normal conditions , and aim at postponing the onset of congestion under heavy traffic conditions .",
    "more recent developments stress greater adaptability . for instance utopia",
    "@xcite combines a regional control based on prediction of traffic flow through the main network arteries with the action of local intersection controllers .",
    "the regional control simply serves as a reference for local control .",
    "opac @xcite optimizes queues in accordance with the `` store - and - forward '' concept @xcite , based on dynamic programming , with a rolling horizon .",
    "opac is fundamentally designed to manage intersections but extends to networks .",
    "even more decentralized and demand - responsive at a very local level , prodyn @xcite optimizes traffic at intersections by switching traffic lights on a traffic - actuated basis .",
    "optimality is achieved through the dynamic programming technique .",
    "prodyn also tries to coordinate neighboring intersections .",
    "a further development includes dynamic assignment into the calculation of optimal traffic light settings as well as non - mandatory management schemes ( user information ) .",
    "metacor @xcite , based on an optimal control strategy with a rolling horizon , is a good example of this approach .",
    "in the same line of approach , tuc @xcite displays two innovative features :    * a reference strategy is calculated for the network ( for a given situation ) , * a filter is included into the algorithm which calculates the commands .",
    "the aim of the filter is to detect and adjust deviations from the nominal traffic situation , and also to detect in real time deviations in parameter values .",
    "a notable trend in recent research on demand - responsive traffic management systems is greater reliance on artificial intelligence ( ai ) methods , prompted by an ever growing complexity of algorithms , models and data .",
    "let us cite some examples of this trend : @xcite and claire @xcite .",
    "overall , no matter how sophisticated these classical approaches ,    * either their responsiveness is limited and they appear as tools both coercive and normative ( imposing a traffic situation rather than responding to it ) , * or they are completely demand - responsive ( claire or prodyn for instance ) and lack a global coordination . the tuc strategy might be viewed as a nice compromise .",
    "all classical approaches require vast amounts of data collection and processing , as well as huge processing power .",
    "further , global coordination notoriously requires data difficult to obtain or elaborate such as dynamic origin - destination matrices or dynamic assignment data . finally , the systems described so far have a difficult time responding to exceptional events , accidents , temporary building sites or other changes in the road network , natural or industrial disasters , catastrophes , terrorist attacks etc",
    ".    hence the usefulness of the decentralized and self - organized approach advocated in this paper is its greater degree of flexibility , its independence of a central traffic control center , and its greater robustness with respect to local perturbations or failures . as shown in sec .",
    "[ trafcont ] and summarized in sec .",
    "[ summa ] , our autonomous adaptive control based on a traffic - responsive self - organization of traffic lights leads to reasonable operations , including synchronization patterns such as green waves .",
    "in particular , our principle of self - control is suited for irregular ( i.e.  non - manhattan type ) road networks with counterflows , with main roads ( arterials ) and side roads , with varying inflows , and with changing turning or assignment fractions .",
    "this distinguishes our approach from simplified scenarios investigated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "another interesting feature is that our approach considers not only `` pressures '' on the traffic lights related to delay times .",
    "it also takes into account `` counter - pressures '' when subsequent road sections are full , i.e. when green times can not be effectively used .",
    "in our model of urban road traffic , road networks are composed of nodes ( intersections , plazas , dead ends , or cross sections of the road ) , which are connected by directed links @xmath0 , representing homogeneous road sections without changes in capacity .",
    "our road sections @xmath0 are characterized by a constant number @xmath1 of lanes , over which traffic is assumed to be equally distributed .",
    "different lanes turning into different directions may be treated as separate road sections , depending on the respective design of the infrastructure .",
    "road sections can have a very large length @xmath2 , which is in favor of numerical efficiency .",
    "the dynamics within a link of the road network is described by the section - based queueing - theoretical traffic model by helbing ( 2003b ) .",
    "it is directly related to the equation of vehicle conservation @xcite and briefly introduced , here .",
    "the average velocity of vehicles on link @xmath0 around place @xmath3 at time @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 , the spatial density per lane by @xmath6 , and the flow per lane by @xmath7 .",
    "the flow is approximated by a triangular flow - density relationship @xmath8 & \\mbox{otherwise ( in congested traffic ) .",
    "} \\end{array}\\right . \\label{flowdens}\\ ] ] while the increasing line @xmath9 describes free traffic moving with speed @xmath10 , the falling `` jam line '' describes congested traffic , in which the average vehicle distance @xmath11 is given by an effective vehicle length @xmath12 (= vehicle length plus minimum front - bumper - to - back - bumper distance ) plus a safety distance @xmath13 which grows linearly with the speed @xmath14 .",
    "the proportionality factor is the ( safe ) time gap @xmath15 kept in congested traffic .",
    "therefore , our model is based on only three intuitive parameters : the maximum jam density @xmath16 , the free velocity @xmath10 ( speed limit ) on link @xmath0 , and the time gap in congested traffic @xmath15 . in our paper",
    ", we have chosen @xmath17  km / h , @xmath18  vehicles per kilometer and lane , and @xmath19  s.    we should note that there are other macroscopic traffic models such as the non - local , as - inetic - based raffic ( gkt ) model @xcite , which can describe the aggregate dynamics of traffic flows more accurately than this model .",
    "the `` gkt model '' has even been successfully implemented to simulate traffic flows on all german freeways , taking into account information by local detectors and floating car data .",
    "however , the dynamics of urban traffic is dominated by the dynamics of the traffic lights , which justifies simplifications in favor of numerical efficiency and analytical treatment .",
    "the section - based traffic model covers the most essential features of traffic flow in urban road networks , e.g.  the transition between free and congested traffic , the spreading and interaction of vehicle queues , etc .",
    "its particular strengths are its transparency , numerical stability , and computational efficiency . compared to microsimulation models of urban traffic such as cellular automata models @xcite",
    ", the treatment of lane changes , intersections , and turning operations is much easier , and analytical investigations are possible .      the particular simplicity of the section - based traffic model results from its two constant characteristic velocities : while perturbations of free traffic propagate together with the cars at the speed @xmath10 , in congested traffic perturbations travel upstream with the constant velocity @xmath20 which has the typical value of @xmath21  m / s or @xmath22  km / h .",
    "a favorable property of the section - based traffic model is that all relevant quantities can be determined from the boundary flows , which makes the model very efficient .",
    "for example , the dynamics inside a road section @xmath0 can be easily derived from the arrival flow @xmath23 and the departure flow @xmath24 per lane with the two characteristic velocities @xmath10 and @xmath25 , see fig .",

    "the temporal change of the number @xmath33 of vehicles per lane on road section @xmath0 can be also determined from the arrival and departure flows : @xmath34 the time - dependent change of the congested area of length @xmath35 will be discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "since our road sections are homogeneous by definition , congestion can only be triggered at their downstream ends .",
    "while the congested area might eventually expand over the entire road section , the downstream end remains at @xmath36 .",
    "the upstream end lies at @xmath37 , where jumps @xmath38 and @xmath39 occur in the density and in the flow , respectively . in order to ensure the conservation of vehicles",
    ", the condition @xmath40 must be fulfilled .",
    "therefore , the border line between free and congested traffic moves with the following velocity @xcite : @xmath41/v_i^0\\big )          - q_i^{\\rm dep}\\big(t - l_i(t)/|c|\\big ) }      { \\rho_i^{\\rm arr}\\;\\big(t-[l_i - l_i(t)]/v_i^0\\big )          - \\rho_i^{\\rm dep}\\;\\big(t - l_i(t)/|c|\\big ) }      \\;. \\label{queulen}\\ ] ] note that , within the congested area of length @xmath35 , one might find areas of quasi - free traffic , where the vehicles reach the maximum free velocity @xmath10 and the maximum flow @xmath42 per lane that is possible according to the flow - density relationship ( [ flowdens ] ) : @xmath43 this value corresponds to vehicles accelerating out of a traffic jam every @xmath44 seconds .",
    "nevertheless , the value @xmath45 is not completely reached , as each subsequent vehicle has to drive an additional distance @xmath12 in order to reach the respective measurement cross section .",
    "this requires an additional time interval of @xmath46 as in the formula above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : corr ] ) .     and",

    "therefore , the effective length @xmath49 of the vehicle queue is @xmath50 if this effective queue has been fully resolved at time @xmath51 , i.e.  @xmath52 , it takes an additional time @xmath53 until the last vehicle of that queue has left the road section @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we reach @xmath54 and , thereby , free traffic on the whole road section @xmath0 , at time @xmath55 . before this point in time , vehicles that have moved out of the queue may still be trapped again by a red traffic light at the end of road section @xmath0 .",
    "let the travel time @xmath56 be the time a vehicle needs to pass through the road section @xmath0 when entering it at time @xmath4 .",
    "then , the actual number @xmath33 of vehicles inside the road section is given by @xmath57 this formula implies the following delay - differential equation describing how the travel time @xmath58 depends on the boundary flows @xcite : @xmath59 according to this , the travel time can be predicted based on the anticipated departure flow , e.g.  when a certain traffic light control is assumed ( see secs .",
    "[ delay ] and [ basic ] ) .",
    "since the travel time would exactly be @xmath60 without congestion , any deviation from that can be understood as the time a vehicle has been delayed due to congestion .",
    "therefore , we may introduce the delay time @xmath61 since @xmath60 is time - independent , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : traveltime ] ) applies to @xmath62 as well .",
    "consider a road section with a constant arrival flow @xmath23 and a departure flow @xmath63 being controlled by a traffic light . as the buffer size is given by the maximum number @xmath64 of vehicles per lane on road section @xmath0 , from eq .",
    "( [ num ] ) we can derive @xmath65 with the average green time fraction @xmath66 for @xmath67 we can see that the average arrival rate per lane on road section @xmath0 should not exceed the maximum flow times the green time fraction @xmath68 .",
    "otherwise , we will have a growing queue , until the maximum storage capacity @xmath69 for vehicles on road section @xmath0 has been reached .",
    "the throughput is reduced if a downstream road section @xmath70 is sometimes fully congested , as this limits the departure flow .",
    "moreover , the delay time can temporarily increase , if the arrival of vehicles at the upstream boundary of road section @xmath0 is not synchronized with the green phase of the traffic light at the downstream end .",
    "such a synchronization of arrivals in @xmath0 with the desired departure times is hard to reach in an irregular road network . as a consequence ,",
    "vehicles tend to queue up at a red light before they can leave a road section @xmath0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sync ] ) .",
    "note , however , that a green light reaches maximum efficiency when it serves vehicles which have queued up before .",
    "let us now study the case where the waiting queues can not be cleared completely within one green phase .",
    "how long is a vehicle delayed , if it joins a queue of length @xmath71 at time @xmath72 ?",
    "the totally required green time needed until the vehicle can leave the road section @xmath0 is given by @xmath73 since @xmath74 is the number of vehicles per lane to be served and @xmath42 the service rate .",
    "let us now estimate the overall time passed until the downstream boundary of road section @xmath0 is reached .",
    "it is given by the formula @xmath75    the time delay of vehicle @xmath0 by queuing , red and yellow times is the overall time passed minus the travel time @xmath76 in free traffic : @xmath77 generally , this formula is difficult to express , as its result depends sensitively on the respective red and green phases .",
    "however , the formula for the average delay time becomes quite simple .",
    "just remember that the average green time fraction is @xmath68 and the average fraction of red and yellow times must be @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the average delay @xmath79 as a function of the average queue length @xmath80 and the green time fraction @xmath68 is estimated by the formula @xmath81 according to this , the average delay time @xmath79 is proportional to the average queue length @xmath80 , but a large green time fraction @xmath68 is helpful .",
    "note that the formulas of this section are not only applicable to situations with fixed cycle times and signal programs .",
    "they are also applicable to situations where the red and green phases are varying .",
    "the in- and outflow of a road section is not only limited by capacity constraints such as @xmath42 , but also by the actual state of traffic .",
    "we will , therefore , denote the potential arrival and departure flows per lane by @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "congestion is triggered if @xmath84 , and resolved if @xmath54 . in the case",
    "where the road section is entirely congested , i.e.  @xmath85 , this state remains until @xmath86 .",
    "the potential flows are determined as follows : as long as there is no congestion , the potential departure flow is given by the former arrival flow @xmath87 .",
    "when the downstream end of road section @xmath0 is congested , vehicles are queued up and can depart with the maximum possible flow @xmath42 .",
    "altogether , we have @xmath88 at the upstream end , the maximum possible flow @xmath42 can enter road section @xmath0 as long as it is not entirely congested . otherwise , the arrival flow is limited by the former departure flow @xmath89 .",
    "this implies @xmath90 in cases , where the outflow of the road section is to be controlled by a traffic light , the potential departure flow @xmath83 must be multiplied with a prefactor @xmath91 .",
    "a green light corresponds to @xmath92 , a red light to @xmath93 . note that it is also possible to vary @xmath91 gradually to account for drivers passing the signal during yellow phases .",
    "a node of the road network connects one or several incoming road sections @xmath0 with one or several outgoing road sections @xmath70 , see figure [ fig : node](a ) .",

    "[ fig : node](b ) , two cases can be distinguished : as long as the subsequent road section @xmath70 has sufficient capacity to admit the potential flows of all incoming road sections @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath107 , the flow through the node is given by the upstream traffic conditions in the road sections @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise , some of the upstream departure flows @xmath24 have to be restricted .",
    "but which ones ? according to practical experience , small traffic flows @xmath24 can almost always squeeze in , while flows from equivalent roads tend to share the capacity @xmath108 equally .",
    "note that in scenarios with main roads having a right of way , the corresponding flow is to be served first .",
    "the remaining capacity is subsequently distributed among the side roads .",

    "this is , for example , the case when a road splits up into lanes for turning left , continuing straight ahead , or turning right . for diverges",
    ", the throughput is determined by a cascaded minimum - function : @xmath109 the first term on the right - hand side is obvious , as any restriction of the potential departure flow @xmath83 of road section @xmath0 limits the flows to all outgoing road sections @xmath70 . the second term on the right - hand side follows from the fact that the fraction @xmath102 of the departure flow @xmath24 to any subsequent road section @xmath70 is limited by its potential arrival flow @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 in the special case of a node connecting only two subsequent road sections @xmath0 and @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 and the throughput is just limited by the minimum of both potential flows : @xmath114 the last equality follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : divergefraction ] ) .",
    "the simplest way to model turning at intersections is by turning coefficients @xmath100 , which assume that a certain fraction @xmath100 of the departure flow @xmath24 turns into road section @xmath70 . in many theoretical studies ,",

    "this , however , requires that the green times are fully used .",
    "otherwise , at small arrival rates , traffic lights would potentially delay vehicles .    despite of the simplifications made in the above considerations , the following conclusions are quite general : it is most efficient if vehicles can pass the intersection immediately one by one , if the arrival rates are small . above a certain threshold , however , it is more efficient to form vehicle platoons by means of traffic lights .",

    "<S> in fact , we suggest to turn push operation of traffic systems into pull operation : by removing vehicles as fast as possible from the network , queuing effects can be most efficiently avoided . the proposed control concept can utilize the cheap sensor technologies available in the future and leads to reasonable operation modes . </S>",
