    "the thermal sz effect is sensitive to various physical processes like adiabatic gravitational heating , feedback , preheating and radiative cooling @xcite which affect the thermal energy of the baryons .",
    "in addition , compton cooling of first star supernova remnants @xcite , cluster magnetic field @xcite , etc .",
    "could further alter the thermal energy of the universe to the level of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the precision measurement and interpretation are of great importance to understand the thermal history of the universe .    current cmb experiments such as cbi@xcite , bima@xcite and acbar @xcite marginally detected the sz effect .",
    "several upcoming cmb experiments such as act , apex , planck , spt and sza are likely able to measure the sz effect with @xmath21 accuracy in the next several years . in order to utilize the power of such accurate experiments , the modeling of the sz effect is required to meet this @xmath21 accuracy .",
    "the first natural step for such modeling is to robustly understand the evolution of the baryon thermal energy in an adiabatically evolving universe .",

    "much effort has been devoted toward this goal , both analytically @xcite and simulationally @xcite .",
    "both methods have limitations , which has not been quantified and corrected to meet the precision of future observations .",
    "analytical models of the sz effect are often _ ad hoc _ procedures . in the halo model ,",
    "the cluster gas pressure distribution is a free function of cluster mass and redshift . though it can be calculated by various assumptions such as hydrostatic equilibrium , its uncertainty is hard to quantify . in the continuum field model @xcite ,",
    "the gas temperature is determined by the gravitational potential , whose zero point is determined somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "so , analytical models must be tested and calibrated against simulations .",
    "for instance , @xcite has tested the halo model against simulations and found good agreement .",
    "however , the conclusions drawn from these comparisons should be viewed with some caution .",
    "numerical simulations are known to have artifacts , stemming from limited resolution and finite volume .",
    "the impact of some of the artifacts have been investigated for the thermal sz effect @xcite and the kinetic sz effect @xcite .",
    "if not corrected , such artifacts would lead to biased calibrated analytical models .",
    "the sz mean temperature decrement , or equivalently , the mean sz compton @xmath1 parameter , which corresponds to the density weighted gas mean temperature @xmath0 , are the lowest order sz statistics .",

    "so , the precision prediction of @xmath0 and @xmath4 stands as the first natural step toward the precision modeling of the sz effect .",
    "their precision modeling also provides clues for the next low order sz statistics such as the sz power spectrum and the corresponding gas pressure power spectrum . in this paper , we present a detailed study of the igm density and temperature distribution from a series of @xmath11cdm and self similar simulations .",

    "but such regions generally have high mach number and thus shocks are relatively poorly resolved . since gas thermal energy is generated by shock heating , in low density regions , temperature field is likely poorly resolved . in high density regions , it is the opposite case .",
    "[ fig : wmapcom2 ] shows that both fields are indeed significantly affected by resolutions .",

    "so , for @xmath65 , shock capture is the dominant resolution factor . in summary ,",
    "the igm density and temperature distribution in simulations is mainly limited by density resolution in high density regions and shock capturing ability in low density regions .",
    "we thus expect that higher resolution simulations will result in larger dispersion in the gas @xmath77-@xmath53 phase space distribution , and thus larger pressure dispersion .",
    "this conclusion is further confirmed in the @xmath53-@xmath77 contours of the probability distribution for our self similar simulation results ( fig .",

    "* our simulations suggest that ( 1 ) only a small fraction of gas are virialized and ( 2 ) a strong correlation exists between gas temperature and density .",
    "both apparently contradict with the halo model .",
    "the halo model assumes that all gas resides in virialized halos .",
    "this assumption seems to contradict with ( 1 ) , as noticed by @xcite .",
    "the simplest version of the halo model assumes gas to be isothermal with temperature equal to its virial temperature .",
    "since halos roughly have the same density , the predicted @xmath53-@xmath77 correlation should be very weak .",
    "the weak dependence of halo concentration number on halo mass can not alter this straight prediction .",
    "more complicated intracluster gas models such as the _ universal gas profile _ @xcite predict a weak variation of gas temperature from the core to the virial radius .",
    "but such variation is still too weak to explain the simulated @xmath79 relation . *",
    "but simulations are resolution limited and some artifacts can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "it is likely that the part of the contradictions discussed above are caused by the limited simulation resolution .",
    "the limited simulation resolution effectively smooths the density field and may cause an underestimation of the fraction of virialized gas . the spacial resolution ( @xmath87 mpc / h for our largest simulation ) instead of",
    "the mass resolution is the main limiting factor to resolve halos .",
    "if our simulation only resolves halos with virial radius @xmath88 mpc / h , following the press - schechter formalism @xcite , such halos contain @xmath89\\sim 30\\%$ ] of the total mass at @xmath8 .",
    "here , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the density threshold , @xmath92 is the density fluctuation in a sphere with mean mass @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the mass of halos with @xmath95 .",
    "this mass fraction is consistent with our simulation results .",
    "but this predicted mass fraction is very sensitive to the @xmath96 assumed .",
    "for example , if @xmath97 mpc / h , the predicted virialized gas fraction would be @xmath98 and thus contradicts with our simulation result .",
    "one can also compare the prediction of @xmath54 of halo model with our simulation .",
    "the gas temperature @xmath53 of a halo mass @xmath93 can be estimated by @xmath99 , where at @xmath8 , @xmath100 kev @xcite and @xmath101 is the mean mass contained in a sphere with radius @xmath102 mpc / h .",
    "thus the halo model predicts @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "these predictions are roughly consistent with our simulation result .",
    "thus , a low fraction of virialized gas may be caused by simulation resolution .",
    "the effect of resolution to the @xmath105 relation can be estimated as follow .. the density profile of each halo can be approximated as @xmath106 .",
    "the smoothing caused by limited resolution convolves this density field with a window function with radius @xmath107 . for halos with @xmath108",
    ", the smoothed density @xmath109 will be @xmath110 . here",
    ", we have utilized that @xmath111 .",
    "for wmap cosmology at @xmath8 , this implies that @xmath112 .",
    "this relation is surprisingly consistent with our simulation , if taking @xmath113 mpc / h . so the @xmath105 relation may also be caused by artifacts of simulations and has to be used in caution .    on the other hand ,",
    "the simulation resolution is hard to explain all aspects of simulation results .",
    "the @xmath77-@xmath53 relation shows a robust convergence in the self similar simulations ( e.g. 20% , 50% @xmath77-@xmath53 contour in fig .",
    "4 ) and only changes very slowly as the non - linear length scale changes by a factor of 4 .",
    "this suggests that it is unlikely that the observed @xmath77-@xmath53 relation is purely caused by simulation artifacts , otherwise the @xmath77-@xmath53 relation would change significantly with resolution .",
    "these issues deserves further investigations .",
    "but more careful comparison requires more realistic halo mass function than the press - schechter formalism and a series of simulations to have fair sample of @xmath114 kev halos and thus beyonds the scope of this paper .    but despite these significant resolution effects on both density and temperature fields , the simulated overall @xmath54 shows a good convergence except at very low or high temperature ranges ( fig . [",
    "fig : wmapcom1 ] & [ fig : tdn11 ] ) .",
    "since the energy conservation guarantees the total amount of kinetic and thermal energy to be well simulated , the good agreement of @xmath54 implies that the conversion efficiency from kinetic energy to thermal energy is well simulated too . since @xmath115 , the effect of simulation limitations to @xmath0 should be minor , as we will quantify in the next section .",
    "the simulated @xmath116 would be less resolution dependent and robust .",
    "we will develop our model for @xmath116 in the next section , test it against simulations , quantify simulation artifacts and provide a precision model of @xmath116 .",
    "as we will show in  [ sec : model ] , the simulation effect on @xmath0 is only non - negligible at @xmath117 and this effect is no bigger than @xmath118 , even at @xmath8 .",
    "in a gravitational heating scenario , the gas temperature is determined by the gravitational potential @xmath119 .",
    "the pressure depends on the thermalized fraction of the total kinetic energy .",
    "the translational kinetic energy is thermalized from the energy released when particles shell cross . a model of the thermalized energy",
    "is thus given by the difference in energy between two particles separated by a non - linear scale in lagrangian space , which is the distance at which they can be expected to have shell crossed .",
    "the exact procedure amounts to solving the non - linear evolution equations directly .",
    "but we can treat the effect statistically in a linear fashion . in the initial linear evolution ,",
    "the gravitational potential remains constant .",
    "after virialization , the gravitational energy at a fixed location remains almost constant . in an eulerian description , we can describe the energy of particles at a final virialized location as the energy released as a particle travels from its initial position to the final virialized location .",
    "we can then relate the gas temperature to @xmath119 through the viral theorem : @xmath120.\\ ] ] since the initial position is not exactly known , we take a spherical average over the non - linear scale to average over all possible initial locations and obtain the mean initial potential @xmath121 for a detailed explanation , refer to @xcite .",

    "@xmath125 is the dark matter - gas cross correlation power spectrum .    in our model , @xmath126 is a free function , but its asymptotic behavior toward @xmath127 is fixed by the requirement that @xmath128 follows the density field at large scales , or equivalently , the @xmath128 bias with respect to the underlying density field is a constant at large scales .",
    "its behavior at small scales is hard to determine from first principles .",
    "but since at scales smaller than smoothing scale , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , the exact behavior of @xmath126 at large @xmath124 is not very important . based on these considerations , a natural choice of @xmath126 is a gaussian function @xmath131 . for this function , when @xmath132 , @xmath133 , so the temperature bias with respect to the density field is a constant . since gas gains thermal energy by shell crossing , which happens at the nonlinear scales , we expect @xmath134 to be roughly equal to the density correlation length .",

    "such discrepancy increases toward low redshifts and exceeds @xmath152 level at @xmath8 ( fig .",

    "the halo model rely on different assumptions and require different input . though both models are based on virial theorem , the continuum model treats gas as continuum field and the halo model treats gas as distributed in discrete halos .",
    "the continuum model requires the nonlinear density power spectrum , while the halo model requires the halo mass function and the halo @xmath185 relation .",
    "the consistency in the predictions of two distinctive models gives us confidence that the predicted @xmath0 is reliable and simulations artifacts are suitably handled .",
    "*    for the wmap cosmology , we predict @xmath186 kev .",
    "@xmath0 is sensitive to @xmath187 and @xmath188 . for self similar cosmology , @xmath189 . for @xmath11cdm , the actual dependences of @xmath0 on @xmath187 and @xmath188 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t_cosmology ] ) is complicated due to the running index of the density power spectrum . in our interested @xmath187 and @xmath188",
    "range , the effective power index @xmath190 is @xmath191 .",
    "so @xmath192 with @xmath193-@xmath194 and @xmath195 . a smaller @xmath187 results in a larger @xmath143 and thus a smaller effective power index @xmath190 .",
    "so @xmath196 is larger .",
    "the deviation of @xmath197 from unity comes from the dependence of @xmath190 on @xmath188 since cdm transfer function depends on the combination @xmath198 . around the wmap cosmology @xmath36 and @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath128 can be fitted as @xmath199",

    "@xmath4 is generally @xmath200 . for the wmap cosmology ,",
    "@xmath201 and the mean temperature decrement at rayleigh - jeans regime is @xmath202k .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from @xmath203 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : yz ] ) . since at @xmath204 , @xmath205",
    ", one may expect @xmath206 .",
    "but since in a higher matter density universe , the density field evolves faster and thus @xmath0 drops faster with increasing @xmath163 , the @xmath4 dependence on @xmath188 is stronger than @xmath207 .",
    "indeed , we find @xmath208 . around the wmap cosmology @xmath36 and @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath4 can be fitted as @xmath209    though our model is able to predict the compton @xmath4 in an adiabatically evolving universe to several percent accuracy , it does not include any non - gravitational thermal processes , which introduce non - negligible effect to @xmath4 .",
    "photo - ionization contributes @xmath210 , or @xmath73 of the adiabatic igm @xmath4 .",
    "though feedback , preheating , radiative cooling may decrease the sz power spectrum by a factor of @xmath211 @xcite , they only affects @xmath4 at @xmath6 level ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is straightforward to understand .",
    "once hydrostatic equilibrium is reached , the gas pressure is always determined by the gravitational potential , which is mainly set by dark matter distribution and is only weakly affected by these thermal processes .",
    "feedback and preheating do not change the total amount of gas . while radiative cooling turns some gas into bound objects ,",
    "such mass loss is minor since bounds objects in galaxies only accounts for @xmath212 baryons .",
    "thus , the change of the total gas thermal energy due to these processes is minor .",
    "these processes change @xmath4 mainly during the stages of expansion in the case of feedback and preheating and infall in the case of radiative cooling .",
    "such stages are either in semi hydrostatic equilibrium ( feedback and radiative cooling ) or last relatively short time ( mild preheating ) , thus their effects to @xmath4 is not significant .",
    "cluster magnetic field also only has @xmath73 effect to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "wmap measured a high thomson optical depth to the last scatter surface and implies an early reionization epoch caused by first stars . at high @xmath163 ,",
    "cmb density is high and is able to convert a considerable fraction of first star supernova explosion thermal energy through the efficient compton cooling .",
    "such first star contribution to @xmath4 is @xmath213 few @xmath214 and comparable to low redshift igm @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these processes have distinctive signatures to @xmath4 and the sz power spectrum , respectively . for first stars , since at high @xmath215 , density fluctuations are small , the relative contribution of first stars to the sz fluctuation is much smaller than that of to @xmath4 . as estimated by @xcite , even if first star @xmath4 is larger than that of low redshift igm , its contribution to the sz power spectrum can still be an order of magnitude smaller than that of low redshift igm ( fig . 1 , @xcite ) .",
    "the case of photon - ionization is similar , but that of feedback , preheating , radiative cooling and magnetic field is opposite .",
    "thus , combining the @xmath4 and the power spectrum measurement helps to separate these contributions more unambiguously .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 can be measured to @xmath10 accuracy , the first star contribution can be constrained with a statistical uncertainty @xmath216 and systematic underestimation of @xmath217 caused by feedback , etc .",
    "unfortunately , the direct precision measurement of absolute @xmath4 is difficult .",
    "currently , the best measurement , @xmath218 is given by the cobe / firas measurement @xcite .",
    "this result has already been able to rule out combinations of high @xmath17 and high @xmath219 .",
    "this constrain is quite weak . but considering the contributions from non - gravitational processes could make it stronger .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath4 may be measured to a higher accuracy in the future and/or inferred from new statistics and helps to independently constrain @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the mean gas density weighted temperature @xmath0 and the mean sz compton @xmath1 parameter are the lowest order sz statistics .",
    "their precision modeling stands as the first step toward the precision understanding of the igm sz effect and may provide useful clues for modeling of higher order statistics .",
    "the two ways of the sz modeling , analytical models and hydro simulations both have their own limitations .",
    "it is essential to quantify simulations limitations and test analytical models against corrected simulations . the convergence of @xmath0 stands as the lowest requirement for simulations to reliably predict the sz effect .",
    "we ran @xmath220 self similar @xmath49 hydro simulations to quantify simulation limitations utilizing their self similar scaling relation .",
    "we also ran a high resolution @xmath5 cell , 100 mpc / h box size hydro simulation adopting wmap cosmology .",
    "we find that the simulated @xmath54 , the fraction of mass with temperature bigger than @xmath53 , shows a good convergence for all our simulations , except at both tails .",
    "this convergence suggests that @xmath0 is well simulated .",
    "our continuum field model is then tested against these simulations .",
    "it passed all tests and we believe that its prediction for @xmath4 is accurate to several percent",
    ".    various simulation limitations such as limited box size and limited resolution can affect the simulated @xmath0 .",
    "generally , for a @xmath11cdm simulation , the nonlinear scale is much smaller than the box size , thus the box size effect is negligible and the resolution effect is the dominant cause of simulation artifacts in @xmath0 . due to curvature in the cdm power spectrum ,",
    "the temperature is more difficult to model accurately in simulations at fixed comoving resolution .",
    "we found that , at @xmath8 , due to the simulation resolution , gas power spectrum loses power at small scales with respect to dark matter power spectrum .",
    "this behavior causes the simulated gas density weighted temperature @xmath0 to be @xmath9 underestimated .",
    "but this resolution effect becomes negligible quickly toward higher redshift . at @xmath7 ,",
    "simulated @xmath0 is quite accurate .",
    "since the dominant contribution to @xmath4 comes from @xmath221 , our simulation prediction of @xmath4 is reliable to @xmath10 level .",
    "furthermore , our analytical model is able to correct this simulation artifacts and predicts @xmath4 with several percent accuracy . for a flat , low matter density @xmath11cdm universe , @xmath222 .",
    "the current upper limit of @xmath16 measured by firas has already ruled out combinations of high @xmath17 and high @xmath18 .",
    "our simulations confirms previously found @xmath79 relation in a large region of @xmath77-@xmath53 plane .",
    "simulation resolution may be partly responsible for this relation .",
    "but the results of self similar simulations show robust convergence of this relation and can not be explained by simulation resolution artifacts .",
    "this issue deserves a further investigation .",
    "we also found that , the simulated @xmath223 , does not converge . at high density regions ,",
    "it is caused by density resolution limitation while at low density regions , it is caused by failure of capturing shocks .",
    "though this numerical limitation has only minor effect on @xmath0 , it may affect the gas pressure power spectrum a lot .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a companion paper .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for many helpful comments , especially the comparison with the halo model .",
