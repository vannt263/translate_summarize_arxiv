    "in the past decade , superconductivity in sodium cobaltate na@xmath0coo@xmath1h@xmath2o ( nco ) has been intensively studied in that it shares many similarities with high - t@xmath4 cuprates@xcite .",
    "the doped cobaltate has a lamellar structure consisting of two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular coo@xmath2 layers separated by a thick insulating layer of na@xmath5 ions and h@xmath2o molecules@xcite .",
    "although the t@xmath4 is a little bit lower , it displays the same kind of doping - controlled phase diagram that is observed in the doped cuprates@xcite .",
    "in particular , the electron - doped nco may be another unconventional superconductor coming from the family of doped mott insulators .",
    "although the ferromagnetic correlations is present in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 for large electron doping regimes@xcite , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) short - range spin correlations in na@xmath0coo@xmath2 and nco at low doping levels has been observed from quadrupolar resonance and thermopower as well as other experimental measurements@xcite .",
    "therefore , superconductivity mediated by the af spin fluctuations in the doped cobaltate suggests the importance of the strong electron correlation as in the doped cuprates@xcite .",
    "understanding its superconducting ( sc ) mechanism could provide important insight into the microscopic origin of the unconventional superconductivity .",
    "recently , the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism applied into the doped cuprates based on the charge - spin separation fermion - spin theory@xcite has been successfully studied , where the dressed charge carriers interact occurring directly through the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations , leading to a net attractive force between dressed charge carriers , then the electron cooper pairs originating from the dressed charge carriers pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , their condensation reveals the sc ground state , and the sc transition temperature is controlled by both charge carrier gap function and quasiparticle coherent weight . since there is a remarkable resemblance in the normal and sc - state properties between nco and the doped cuprates@xcite as mentioned above , and",
    "since the strong electron correlation is common for both materials , it thus could be expected that two systems may have similar underlying sc mechanism , i.e. , superconductivity in the electron - doped cobaltate is also driven by the kinetic energy .",
    "taking it into consideration , we in this paper study the unconventional superconductivity of sodium cobaltate nco , and find that the sc state is governed by both charge carrier pairing and quasiparticle coherent , and the resulting sc transition temperature is suppressed to a lower temperature due to the strong magnetic frustration , which is in agreement with experimental measurements@xcite .",
    "then we theoretically analyze the feedback effect of superconductivity with @xmath6-wave pairing symmetry on the magnetic excitations , and find a commensurate resonance peak locating at antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath3 for a broad range of low energies , then evolving outward into six incommensurate magnetic scattering peaks with increasing energy , which is very similar to the case of electron - doped cuprates@xcite , and suggests that magnetic resonance could be intimately related to superconductivity .",
    "we propose that the inelastic neutron scattering experiment can verify the magnetic resonance excitations in electron - doped cobaltates nco after the overcome of the difficulty in growing its high - quality sc sample .",
    "in electron - doped cobaltate , the characteristic feature is the presence of the 2d coo@xmath2 plane @xcite , of which the essential physics is contained in the @xmath7-@xmath8 model on a triangular lattice @xcite as @xmath9 where @xmath10(@xmath11 ) is the fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator subject to the no - double - occupancy constraint , @xmath12 is the spin operator with @xmath13 as the pauli matrices , @xmath14 is the chemical potential .",
    "note here that we work in the hole representation , so that a hole in the above model represents a physical electron - double - occupancy in electron - doped cobaltate .",
    "we apply the charge - spin separation fermion - spin theory @xcite , within which the hole operators can be decoupled as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the spinful fermion operator @xmath17 describes the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of the spin configuration rearrangements , while @xmath18 describes the spin degree of freedom , then the single occupancy local constraint @xmath19 is satisfied in analytical calculations",
    ". then the low - energy behavior of the @xmath7-@xmath8 model can be expressed as@xcite , @xmath20 with @xmath21 , and the doping level @xmath22 . in this case , the magnetic energy ( @xmath8 ) term in @xmath7-@xmath8 model is only to form an adequate dressed spin configuration , while the kinetic energy ( @xmath7 ) term has been transferred as the dressed charge carrier - spin interaction , which dominates the essential physics @xcite .",
    "this dressed charge carrier - spin interaction is quite strong , and induces the dressed charge carrier pairing state ( then the electron pairing state and superconductivity ) by exchanging spin excitations in a higher power of the electron doping level as in the doped cupares@xcite .",
    "then the order parameter for the electron cooper pair without af long range order ( aflro ) can be expressed as , @xmath23 with the dressed charge carrier pairing order parameter @xmath24 .",
    "this shows that the dressed charge carrier pairs move freely in the background of the disordered spin liquid state , and then the physical properties of sc state are essentially determined by the dressed charge carrier pairing state .",
    "based on the eliashberg s strong coupling theory @xcite , we obtain the self - consistent equations in terms of the method of equation of motion that is satisfied by the full dressed charge carrier diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 , \\\\",
    "\\im^{\\dagger}(k)=g^{(0)}(-k ) [ \\sigma^{(a)}_{1}(-k)\\im^{\\dagger}(-k)+\\sigma^{*(a)}_{2 } ( -k)g(k)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively , where the four vector notation @xmath28 , the mean - field ( mf ) dressed fermion green s function @xmath29 , with the mf dressed charge carrier excitation spectrum @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the number of the nearest neighbor sites , @xmath32/3 $ ] , while the self - energies have been derived as , @xmath33 where the mf dressed spin green s function @xmath34 . since the pairing force and dressed fermion gap function have been incorporated into the self - energy @xmath35 , then it is an effective dressed charge carrier gap function . while self - energy @xmath36 renormalizes the mf dressed charge carrier spectrum , so that it describes quasiparticle coherence and dominates the charge transport of the materials @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 is an even function of @xmath37 , while the self - energy @xmath36 is not , which can be split into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts as @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being even functions of @xmath37 .",
    "now we define the charge carrier quasiparticle coherent weight @xmath41 .",
    "we only study the static limit of the effective dressed charge carrier gap function and quasiparticle coherent weight , i.e. , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "then the dressed charge carrier diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions are obtained as , @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and the dressed fermion quasiparticle spectrum @xmath49 .",
    "although @xmath50 is a function of @xmath51 , the wave vector dependence is unimportant in that everything happens at the fermi surface ( fs ) . in this case",
    "we approximate @xmath50 by a constant @xmath52 near the fs@xcite .",
    "so far the pairing symmetry in nco is far from reaching a consensus , many experimental data point towards to spin - singlet cooper pairing and suggest non - s - wave superconductivity without a full gap @xcite . in particular , it has been argued according to the irreducible representations of the triangular lattice that there are three possible basis functions of even parity @xcite , i.e. , one s - like function @xmath53+{\\rm cos } [ ( k_{x}+ \\sqrt{3}k_{y})/2]$ ] , and two d - like functions , @xmath54-{\\rm cos}[(k_{x}+ \\sqrt{3}k_{y})/2]$ ] and @xmath55 -\\sqrt{3}{\\rm cos } [ ( k_{x}- \\sqrt{3}k_{y})/2]$ ] .",
    "however , with the different linear combinations of these basis functions , it has been found @xcite in terms of the gutzwiller approximation scheme and variational monte carlo simulation that the lowest energy state is the d - wave @xmath56 state .",
    "therefore we in the following calculations consider both extended s - wave @xmath57 and the d - wave case @xmath58 , and then the effective dressed fermion gap parameter and quasiparticle coherent weight satisfy the following equations , @xmath59 respectively , where @xmath60 , @xmath61 [ 1 - 2 n_{f}(e_{{\\bf k}})]+e_{{\\bf k } } [ n_{b}(\\omega_{{\\bf p } } ) n_{b } ( -\\omega_{{\\bf q}})+ n_{b}(\\omega_{{\\bf q } } ) n_{b}(-\\omega_{{\\bf p } } ) ] $ ] , @xmath62[1 - 2 n_{f } ( e_{{\\bf k}})]+e_{{\\bf k } } [ n_{b}(\\omega_{{\\bf p } } ) n_{b } ( \\omega_{{\\bf q } } ) + n_{b}(-\\omega_{{\\bf p}})n_{b}(-\\omega_{{\\bf q } } ) ] $ ] , @xmath63- n_{b}(\\omega_{{\\bf p } } ) n_{b}(-\\omega_{{\\bf q}})$ ] , @xmath64-n_{b}(\\omega_{{\\bf q}})n_{b } ( -\\omega_{{\\bf p}})$ ] , @xmath65+n_{b } ( \\omega_{{\\bf p}})n_{b}(\\omega_{{\\bf q}})$ ] , and @xmath66+n_{b}(-\\omega_{{\\bf p}})n_{b}(-\\omega_{{\\bf q}})$ ] .",
    "these two equations determine the sc order directly , and must be solved simultaneously with other self - consistent equations , then all order parameters are determined by the self - consistent calculation @xcite . in terms of the off - diagonal green s function ( 9 ) , we obtain the dressed charge carrier pair order parameter as , @xmath67.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dressed charge carrier pairing state originating from the kinetic energy term by exchanging dressed spin excitations will also lead to form the electron cooper pairing state as mentioned in eq . ( 3 ) . for a discussion of the physical properties in sc state , we now need to calculate the electron off - diagonal green s function @xmath68 . in the framework of the charge - spin separation fermion - spin theory@xcite , it is a convolution of the dressed spin green s function @xmath69 and off - diagonal dressed charge carrier green s function @xmath70 , and can be expressed as , @xmath71 \\over ( i\\omega_{n})^{2}-(\\omega_{{\\bf p}}+e_{{\\bf p - k}})^{2 } } \\right .",

    "parameter can be obtained as @xmath75 , then the effective sc gap parameter should be @xmath76 . as in the doped",
    "cuprates @xcite , our present theory clearly indicates that there is a coexistence of the electron cooper pair and short - range af correlation in the doped cobaltates , and therefore the short - range af fluctuation can persist into superconductivity .",
    "the reason is that the af fluctuation is dominated by the scattering of dressed spins @xcite , which has been incorporated into the electron off - diagonal green s function ( and hence the electron cooper pair ) in terms of the dressed spin green s function .",
    "this result is consistent with some experimental results @xcite .",
    "we perform a numerical calculation for the gap parameters , and the results of the dressed charge carrier ( a ) and sc ( b ) gap parameters in the s-/d - wave symmetry as a function of the electron doping @xmath77 at @xmath78 and @xmath74 are shown in fig .",
    "1 , where both values of the dressed charge carrier and sc gap parameters increase with increasing doping in the underdoped regime , and reach the maximal value for a particular doping concentration , then decrease in the overdoped regime .",
    "although there is a coexistence of the electron cooper pair and short - range af correlation , the value of the sc gap parameter is still suppressed by this af fluctuation .",
    "the sc transition temperature @xmath79 occurs when @xmath80 , which is identical to the dressed charge carrier pair transition temperature occurring in the case of @xmath81 .",
    "the sc transition temperature @xmath79 as a function of doping @xmath77 in the s-/d - wave symmetry for @xmath74 is plotted in fig . 1 ( c ) in comparison with the experimental data @xcite taken from nco ( inset ) .",
    "for the s - wave symmetry , the maximal sc transition temperature t@xmath82 occurs around a particular doping concentration @xmath83 , and then decreases in both lower doped and higher doped regimes .",
    "however , for the d - wave symmetry , the maximal sc transition temperature t@xmath84 occurs around the optimal doping concentration @xmath85 , and then decreases in both underdoped and overdoped regimes .",
    "it is clearly shown that the sc state has the d - wave symmetry in a wide range of doping , in qualitative agreement with the experimental data @xcite , supporting the domination of @xmath6 pairing symmetry in nco .",
    "using an reasonable estimation value of @xmath86 15 mev to 20 mev in nco , the sc transition temperature in the optimal doping is t@xmath87@xcite .",
    "since nco is the electron doped mott insulator on a triangular lattice , the system has strong geometrical spin frustration .",
    "this magnetic frustration also induces the strong charged carrier s quantum fluctuation . in comparison with the case in the doped cuprates",
    ", we find that the sc transition temperature in the doped cobaltates is suppressed heavily to a lower temperature due to both strong magnetic frustration and dressed charge carrier s quantum fluctuation .",
    "we now turn to discuss the feedback effect of superconductivity with the @xmath6-wave pairing symmetry on the magnetic excitations in the doped cobaltates . among various phenomena of the spin excitations in sc state , the neutron spin resonance or",
    "the magnetic resonance observed in sc cuprates is undoubtly the most important feature , which has been regarded as an essential feature in doped mott insulators .",
    "unfortunately , due to the difficulty in growing the high - quality nco sc sample there is no inelastic neutron scattering experiments on this system , so that it will be timely and necessary to study this important issue from the point of theoretical view .    within the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism , the af fluctuation is dominated by the scattering of dressed spins with the full dressed spin green s function",
    "@xmath88where the second order spin self - energy @xmath89 is obtained from the dressed charge carrier bubble in terms of the collective mode in the dressed charge carrier particle - particle channel as , @xmath90where @xmath91-n_{f}(e_{{\\bf p+q}})n_{f}(-e_{{\\bf p}})\\}$ ] , @xmath92-n_{f}(e_{{\\bf p}})n_{f}(-e_{{\\bf p+q}})\\}$ ] , @xmath93 + n_{f}(-e_{{\\bf p+q}})n_{f}(-e_{{\\bf p}})\\}$ ] , @xmath94 -n_{f}(e_{{\\bf p+q}})n_{f}(e_{{\\bf p}})\\}$ ] .",

    "the present result is very similar to the spin resonance excitation of electron - doped cupates@xcite , and differs from the case of hole doped cuprate in which another incommensurate - commensurate spin resonance excitations transition happens at low energies@xcite .",
