    "lattice qcd is the only known way of computing strong interaction observables rigorously from qcd .",
    "even if ( unquenched ) lattice qcd simulations were to be performed at the physical values of the light - quark masses , @xmath4 , extrapolations would be required to obtain information about nature .",
    "as simulations are performed in lattice volumes of finite size , @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the length of the time - dimension and @xmath7 is the length of each spatial - dimension which are taken to be the same for simplicity ) , an extrapolation to the infinite - volume limit , @xmath8 , is required .",
    "in addition , as the lattice - spacing ( @xmath9 ) is necessarily finite , an extrapolation to vanishing lattice spacing , @xmath10 , is essential .",
    "currently , an extrapolation in @xmath4 from those used in the simulations down to those of nature is also required .",
    "in order to perform these extrapolations , it is necessary to construct the effective field theory ( eft ) appropriate for the lattice simulations .",
    "the dependence upon lattice spacing , lattice volume and quark masses computed in the eft can be used to extract the coefficients of local operators that contribute to the observable of interest ( at any given order in the eft expansion ) .",

    "further , once appropriate counterterms have been determined , observables that are significantly more difficult to compute directly from lattice simulations can be computed with the eft .    for simple one - body observables ( we do not discuss the two - particle scattering amplitude or higher - body interactions on the lattice in this work ) in large volumes , deviations from the infinite - volume limit are exponentially suppressed by factors of @xmath14 ( the scale is set by @xmath15 since the pions are the lightest hadrons ) and can be computed with the @xmath16-power - counting of infinite - volume chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "however , in small volumes with @xmath17 but with @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the infinite - volume quark condensate ) one is in the @xmath2-regime , where the small expansion parameter is @xmath2 and not @xmath20 . here",
