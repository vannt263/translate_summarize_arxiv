    "physics of matter under high baryon density is one of the most challenging problems in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) both from technical and physical point of view .",
    "so far there have been proposed various novel phases which include the @xmath9 neutron superfluidity @xcite , the pion @xcite and kaon @xcite condensations , the deconfined quark matter @xcite , the strange matter @xcite , the color superconductivity @xcite , the ferromagnetic quark ordering @xcite and so on .",
    "unfortunately , analyzing these phases from the first principle lattice simulations is retarded due to the complex fermion determinant for 3-color qcd at finite baryon chemical potential with quarks in the fundamental representation .",
    "the situation is however different for 2-color qcd in which the fermion determinant can be made real and the monte - carlo simulations are attainable as was first demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "because of this reason , 2-color qcd provides an unique opportunity to compare various ideas at finite chemical potential with the results from lattice simulations .",
    "one of the major differences between 2-color qcd and 3-color qcd lies in the fact that the color - singlet baryons are bosons in the former .",
    "this implies that the ground state of the 2-color system at finite baryon density in the color - confined phase is an interacting boson system , i.e.  a bose liquid , although the quark fermi liquid may be realized at high baryon density in the color - deconfined phase .",
    "how this bose liquid changes its character as a function of the temperature @xmath1 , the quark chemical potential @xmath2 , and the quark mass @xmath3 is an interesting question by itself and may also give a hint to understand physics of the color superconductivity in 3-color qcd in which the crossover from the bose - einstein condensate of tightly bound quark pairs to the bcs type condensate of loosely bound cooper pairs may take place @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we revisit the thermodynamics of the strong coupling limit of 2-color lattice qcd with staggered fermions with chiral and diquark condensates which was originally studied in @xcite .",
    "our main purpose is to analyze its phase structure and the interplay among the chiral condensate @xmath6 , the diquark condensate @xmath7 , and the baryon density @xmath8 as functions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "this would give not only a useful guide to the actively pursued lattice qcd simulations of the same system in the weak coupling @xcite but also give us physical insight into the bose liquid together with the other knowledge from the instanton liquid model @xcite , the random matrix model @xcite , the chiral perturbation theory @xcite , and the renormalization group @xcite .",
