    "@xmath194    proofs of the following two lemmas are given in appendix [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "theorem [ th : yvarpwl ] is an immediate consequence of lemma [ le : sgnxssgnxu ] combined with ( [ eq : sgnxmean ] ) and ( [ eq : varidentity ] ) .    for the density ( [ eq : p ] ) , @xmath195 [ le : ints ]    consider ( [ eq : dxtv ] ) and suppose @xmath196 and @xmath67 is random with , @xmath197 .",
    "then for any @xmath118 , if @xmath146 , we have @xmath198 [ le : sgnxssgnxu ]    in the special case , @xmath199 , we can write @xmath200 exactly . in this case , by symmetry , @xmath201 , thus by lemma [ le : intpdfpos ] , @xmath202 . consequently the integral on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu4 ] ) vanishes , and ( [ eq : q2 ] ) leads to @xmath203 which is consistent with ( [ eq : yvarpwl ] ) .",
    "when small noise is added to a filippov system , orbits no longer slide along an attracting sliding section of a switching manifold .",
    "instead , with high probability , orbits follow a random path near the switching manifold , fig .",
    "[ fig : noisyflowexslide]-b .",
    "the average size of deviations from the switching manifold is governed by the strength of the noise relative to the magnitude of the vector field in a direction orthogonal to the switching manifold .",
    "the general @xmath5-dimensional stochastic differential equation formed by adding noise to the filippov system ( [ eq : filippov2 ] ) is particularly difficult to analyze due to the discontinuity and multiple dimensions .",
    "for this reason we made the supposition that the system is invariant along the switching manifold .",
    "this prevents an exploration of the effects of noise on orbits that reach the end of an attracting sliding region , but enables calculations to be reduced to one dimension .",
    "moreover , with this reduction directions parallel to the switching manifold may be treated identically and hence it is sufficient to study the two - dimensional system ( [ eq : e ] ) .    for the system ( [ eq : e ] ) , @xmath22 denotes the displacement from the switching manifold and is governed by ( [ eq : dx ] ) with ( [ eq : phi ] ) .",
    "sample paths of ( [ eq : dx ] ) settle to the quasi - steady - state , @xmath113 ( [ eq : qss ] ) , on an @xmath18 time scale .",
    "this  is not a true steady - state because orbits escape a neighbourhood of zero .",
    "however , since this occurs on an exponentially long time scale , see  [ sub : exit ] , it is suitable to assume @xmath22 is distributed by @xmath113 at times in a given range @xmath117 , for any @xmath204 , where we may take small @xmath205 and large @xmath206 , such that this is a long time interval .",
    "this assumption has the benefit of significantly simplifying our calculations",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : dy ] ) is the stochastic differential equation for @xmath23 , which represents displacement along the switching manifold . in the limit ,",
    "@xmath135 , the mean of @xmath23 , ( [ eq : ymean ] ) , limits on filippov s sliding solution , @xmath134 . for @xmath207 , the perturbation of @xmath136 from @xmath134",
    "is @xmath18 , as for a generic smooth system .",
    "the perturbation depends on linear terms in @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in order to gauge the effect of this perturbation on overall dynamics ,",
    "it is necessary to compare it to the standard deviation of @xmath23 . in the case that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are piecewise - constant , @xmath141 is @xmath18 , see theorem [ th : yvarpwl ] . for general @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we conjectured that the leading order terms of @xmath141 are unchanged .",
    "consequently deviations of @xmath23 from @xmath136 are @xmath19 . therefore , assuming @xmath208 , we expect these deviations to dominate the difference between @xmath136 and @xmath134 .",
    "although our above calculations are for differential equations that are static along the switching manifold , we can apply the basic principles gained to more general systems such as the relay control system , ( [ eq : relaycontrolsystem ] ) with ( [ eq : abcvalues ] ) .",
    "first note that since the deterministic equations are independent of @xmath36 , when we make statements asymptotically in @xmath36 , we implicitly assume that the magnitude of any parameter in the deterministic equations is much less than , in particular , @xmath209 .",
    "but , for ( [ eq : relaycontrolsystem ] ) with ( [ eq : abcvalues ] ) , @xmath210 , which is an extremely large value ( we used @xmath211 ) . since @xmath31 represents displacement from the switching manifold and @xmath212 is a direction parallel to the switching manifold , in the context of ( [ eq : e])-([eq : psi ] ) , @xmath213 corresponds to the values of @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "these values influence , to lowest order , the perturbation of the mean from the deterministic solution , ( [ eq : ymean ] ) , but not the deviation of sample paths from the mean , ( [ eq : yvar2 ] ) .",
    "this is a possible explanation for the noise - induced effect identified in  [ sec : motiv ] .",
    "specifically we found that when the parameters of ( [ eq : relaycontrolsystem ] ) with ( [ eq : abcvalues ] ) are tuned such that in the absence of noise orbits settle to oscillatory motion with sliding , the addition of noise may significantly decrease the average oscillation time , fig .",
    "[ fig : noisyexample ] .",
    "a further analysis is required in order to make more definitive statements .",
    "we believe that the decrease in oscillation time with @xmath36 is a consequence of particular geometrical orientations and that an increase in oscillation time with @xmath36 is equally possible for this type of system .",
    "this paper leaves many avenues for future investigations .",
    "perhaps foremost , we would like to understand the perturbation of @xmath136 from @xmath214 in the case that the system explicitly depends on @xmath21 . in particular we would like to understand how noise effects dynamics near the end of an attracting sliding region .",
    "also it remains to consider more general forms for the noise , such as coloured noise or noise that is correlated in @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and study the effects of noise on other scenarios such as sliding bifurcations @xcite .",
    "by lemma [ le : intpdfpos ] and ( [ eq : ss ] ) , @xmath215 which verifies ( [ eq : int1 ] ) . to obtain ( [ eq : int2 ] ) ,",
    "we multiply ( [ eq : fpintegrated ] ) by @xmath83 and take @xmath191 to obtain @xmath216 integration by parts yields @xmath217 for any @xmath218 .",
    "taking @xmath219 gives @xmath220 we evaluate the double integral using laplace transforms .",

    "@xmath194      since ( [ eq : dx ] ) has no explicit time - dependence , @xmath229 furthermore , @xmath230 to evaluate ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu2 ] ) using ( [ eq : sgnx0sgnxu ] ) , we reorder the integrals of @xmath21 , @xmath20 and @xmath27 , but to do this we must first transfer the @xmath27-dependence from the integrand to the limits of integration .",
    "we have @xmath231 where in the second line we conditioned over the first passage time , @xmath232 , of ( [ eq : dx ] ) from @xmath233 to @xmath160 . by lemma [ le : intpdfpos ] , and since @xmath234 , for all @xmath233 , we obtain @xmath235 a similar calculation with @xmath186 produces @xmath236 by combining ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu2 ] ) , ( [ eq : sgnx0sgnxu ] ) , ( [ eq : sgnypxneg ] ) and ( [ eq : sgnypxpos ] ) we arrive at @xmath237 we now simplify the four terms of ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu3 ] ) .",
    "we define @xmath238 so that the first term of ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu3 ] ) may be written as @xmath239 similarly the third term is @xmath240 to the second term of ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu3 ] ) we reorder the integration such that @xmath241 is the outer - most integral instead of the inner - most integral .",
    "this step is straight - forward but requires some care with the limits of integration .",
    "we obtain @xmath242 and similarly for the last term of ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu3 ] ) : @xmath243 we are now able to write ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu3 ] ) as @xmath244 via ( [ eq : p ] ) , it may be demonstrated that @xmath245 decays exponentially to zero as @xmath246 on an @xmath18 time scale .",
    "for this reason it is helpful to apply the substitution @xmath247 to obtain @xmath248 and expand @xmath249 in @xmath36 such that the integral on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : sgnxssgnxu5 ] ) has the form @xmath250 for some coefficients @xmath251 . to obtain the coefficients ,",
