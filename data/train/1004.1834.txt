    "quantum entanglement has been extensively studied , both due to its fundamental significance in quantum theory @xcite and its utility as a resource for quantum communication and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "atomic physics offers a domain with sufficient control of the system and isolation from noise that it has been possible to do extensive experimental study of quantum entanglement @xcite , and , therefore , it is also a productive target for theoretical study of the issue as well .",
    "one of the simplest scenarios for theoretically studying the dynamics of entanglement between atoms is that of two atoms which are isolated from one another and interact with different electromagnetic fields . studying this sort of model led to the discovery of the entanglement sudden death ( sd ) phenomenon @xcite , in which entanglement decays to zero in a finite time rather than asymptotically .",
    "sd has garnered significant interest because it is both unintuitive and potentially undesirable .",
    "an alternative simple model for atom - field interaction in which to study entanglement dynamics is a dicke model @xcite , where one assumes all atoms are grouped in a sample whose size is small compared to the resonant wavelength ( resulting in identical coupling to every atom ) .",
    "however , such a simplistic model may miss the variety of behavior that can result when the atoms are not confined to such a small sample .",
    "entanglement dynamics have been shown to have a significant distance dependence when two atoms are interacting with a common field @xcite . for atoms weakly interacting with a continuum of field modes in the born - markov approximation",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that changing the atomic separation of two atoms can affect whether there is sd and whether there is revival of entanglement , as well as modify the dynamical generation of entanglement ; in short , the qualitative features are sensitive to the atomic spacing . at short interatomic distance",
    "non - markovian effects associated with induced interactions between the atoms due to the quantum field become more pronounced whose qualitative behavior varies greatly with different classes of initial states , as detailed in the study of @xcite .",
    "so it is clear that distance dependence gives rise to a significant variety of behaviors , and some seemingly innocuous approximations can qualitatively alter the entanglement dynamics in unintuitive ways @xcite .    in view of this , we seek to study entanglement dynamics in a model that is sufficiently complex to manifest some of this variety of behavior yet simple enough that the dynamics may be understood in considerable detail and obtained with fewer approximations .",
    "the simplest model one may pursue along this line would be two two - level atoms ( 2la ) coupled to a single mode with couplings that reflect the distance dependence ; however , as we demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , one needs to include at least two field modes before any non - trivial distance dependence can arise in the problem .",
    "so we will study such a model with two field modes here .",
    "out of the class of hamiltonians that can arise from distance dependence , we will focus on two special cases with the aim of illustrating the variety of different behaviors that can arise . specifically",
    ", we will show how sd , dynamical entanglement generation , and other phenomena differ between these two cases .",
    "we will also compare with the behavior of the analogous versions of the two well - studied types of models mentioned above : for two isolated atom - field systems , we will compare with the case where each system is a single 2la interacting with a single field mode @xcite . in the instance of two atoms interacting with the same field , we will compare with the properties of two 2las interacting with a single common field mode @xcite",

    "consider a pair of two - level atoms ( 2la ) coupled via the multipolar interaction hamiltonian to a collection of electromagnetic ( em ) field modes in the dipole and rotating - wave approximation @xcite .",

    ", we will consider traveling - wave mode functions that are solutions to an em boundary value problem which is translation invariant in the coordinate separating the two atoms .",
    "for simplicity , we will discuss traveling plane waves in free space , though another example would be the modes of a toroidal resonator .",
    "having selected traveling plane waves as our mode decomposition , we can then choose to define them such that for each wave vector @xmath14 one of the polarizations is perpendicular to @xmath15 , so that it does not couple to the problem and can be neglected . with this assumption",
    "we know that for all remaining modes @xmath16 in general each @xmath12 may have a different complex phase , so @xmath17 however , it turns out that , without loss of generality , one may study a much smaller set of hamiltonians .      given a particular set of complex phases for the coupling constants @xmath18 , one may make a trivial basis transformation @xmath19 which simply amounts to redefining the reference for the phases of the atoms by @xmath20 and for the fields by @xmath21 .",
    "after this transformation , the interaction hamiltonian becomes @xmath22 with @xmath23 and we may obtain the solution to the original problem by using the transformed hamiltonian : @xmath24 we may always choose a set of phase shifts @xmath25 and @xmath26 such that for some particular @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 making those couplings real , but for other @xmath30 and @xmath31 the phase difference @xmath32 can not generally be eliminated by the added phase shifts and represents the origin of non - trivial physical distance dependence .    if we consider two identical atoms , with frequencies @xmath33 and dipole strengths @xmath34 coupled to a single em field mode , then the previous paragraph implies that it suffices to consider only a hamiltonian where both couplings are real , and the atomic separation does not enter ; thus , there can be no non - trivial distance dependence .",
    "however , if we consider the two identical atoms coupled to two field modes , then without loss of generality we can write the total hamiltonian of the system as @xmath35 where all distance dependence arises from @xmath36 . for simplicity , we will further assume that @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which by eq",

    ", we will consider two special cases , which are arguably extreme cases of the general model , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "since we have assumed the two field modes have the same frequency , rather than using the original modes @xmath42 and @xmath43 one could equally well choose a different mode decomposition of the field where the two modes are replaced by linear combinations @xmath44 and @xmath45 with annihilation operators @xmath46 in the case of two modes with symmetrical coupling ( tmsc ) , where @xmath40 , the interaction hamiltonian can then be written @xmath47\\label{eq : tmsctranshaq}\\ ] ] in terms of these transformed modes , so that the atoms only couple to @xmath48 and not @xmath49 .",
    "this shows that the hamiltonian is equivalent to the model of a single mode symmetrically coupled ( smsc ) to two atoms .",
    "if we consider the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the atom @xmath50 in the tmsc model it should be the same as in the smsc model with a properly transformed initial state .",
    "namely , if the total system ( atoms and modes ) is in an initial state described by the density matrix @xmath51 , then the appropriate initial density matrix for the smsc model is obtained by making the mode transformation of eqs . and and tracing out the second transformed mode @xmath45 .",
    "for example , if the initial state in the tmsc model is separable with the field in a product of glauber coherent states @xmath52 , then @xmath53\\\\ = \\ket{\\phi}\\bra{\\phi}\\otimes\\ket{\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\sqrt{2}}}\\bra{\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{\\sqrt{2}}}=\\op{\\chi}_{smsc}\\left(0\\right)\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] is the appropriate mapping to the equivalent smsc problem .",
    "it is important to note that , because this mapping of initial states involves a partial trace , it is a many - to - one mapping from the tmsc problem to the smsc problem ( and this mapping does not preserve purity ) . in order to solve the dynamics in the smsc model , and by extension the tmsc model ,",
    "we simply compute the time evolution operator expressed in the atomic basis @xmath54 directly by exponentiation ( as in , e.g. @xcite):@xmath55 where @xmath56    when @xmath41 we have a two - mode model with asymmetrical coupling ( tmac ) , and we may again use the mode transformation of eqs .   and and write the hamiltonian as @xmath57.\\label{eq : tmactranshaq}\\ ] ] in this case , rather than both atoms coupling to one mode we see that atom one couples only to transformed mode @xmath44 while atom two couples only to @xmath45 , implying that this hamiltonian is equivalent to a model comprised of two subsystems that are totally isolated from one another , each composed of a single atom coupled to a single mode .",
    "we will call this the double jaynes - cummings ( djc ) model .",

    "the tmac model should be the same as given by the djc model with the proper mapping of initial states . in this case",

    "we again compute the two subsystem unitary time evolution operators by direct exponentiation to obtain @xmath62 with @xmath63      in order to quantitatively study the entanglement dynamics , we must specify a way of quantifying entanglement . for two qubits",
    "one may compute the entanglement measure known as the entanglement of formation efficiently in terms of the wootters concurrence @xcite . in order to compute the concurrence",

    "the concurrence is @xmath66 where the @xmath67s are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath68 in decreasing order .",
    "the entanglement of formation can then be computed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 alternatively , to quantify entanglement one can also use a monotone known as the negativity @xcite ( which quantifies the degree to which the state violates the peres - horodecki positive partial transpose condition ) , defined @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the partial transpose of the density matrix , defined by @xmath73 in an arbitrary basis b , and @xmath74 is the trace norm .",
    "either of these approaches can be used to quantify entanglement .",

    "another significant implication of the mapping between the tmsc and smsc models comes from the fact that the mapping of initial field states between those models is many - to - one ( because it involves a partial trace ) ; this shows us entire classes of field states for the tmsc model that will give exactly the same atomic dynamics .",
    "in particular , we saw that a product squeezed state can be identical to a thermal state with respect to the atomic dynamics .    in examining the dynamical generation of entanglement from an initially separable atomic state in sec .",
    "[ sec : eg ] , we find quite a marked contrast between the tmsc and tmac models . while entanglement generation is a relatively common feature , present for a variety of field states , in the tmsc model , it is comparatively much more rare in the tmac model .",
    "one aspect that highlights these differences is that in the tmac model entanglement can be generated by a product of squeezed states or fock states , but in the tmsc model it can also be generated by more easily prepared states including thermal states and product coherent states .",
    "this difference is not so surprising however , if one views it in terms of the mappings we have introduced to the other models .",
    "when considering that the tmac maps to the djc model , where the two subsystems are isolated , one would expect entanglement generation to be relatively rare ; it can only exist in cases where the field state is mapped to an entangled state whose entanglement can then be transferred to the atoms . with the tmsc ,",
    "by contrast , we have a mapping to the smsc model where a single shared field mode can readily introduce entanglement between the two atoms .    when one is concerned with protecting the entanglement of two initially entangled atoms , our analysis in sec .  [",
    "sec : ep ] shows that again the tmsc model is better for that purpose in most cases . in the tmac entanglement sudden death ( sd )",
    "is a fairly generic feature , with the initial state @xmath130 being one of only two classes we consider that does not show sd ; the @xmath130 shows `` death for an instant '' ( di ) , where entanglement goes to zero only on a finite set of points .",
    "the tmsc shows a reversal of the fortunes of the @xmath130 and @xmath129 states , with the former experiencing di while entanglement for the latter is al , staying non - zero for all times .",
    "moreover , the di property of the dynamics of the @xmath130 state in the tmac model is fragile , in the sense that it is destroyed by even the smallest departure from the vacuum to , for example , a finite temperature field , while for the tmsc model the al feature of the dynamics of the @xmath129 state is robust , remaining for non - zero temperature below a threshold @xmath133 .",
    "this gives us a condition for protecting entanglement in this case .",
    "a different sort of issue we have touched on briefly is the role of quantum correlations between field modes in the entanglement dynamics of the atoms . in the djc model we compared the resulting entanglement dynamics for fields in a two - mode squeezed state ( tmss ) and a thermal state . for appropriate choice of the squeezing parameter",
    ", the tmss has the same reduced density matrix for either mode alone as the thermal state , so in this sense these form a pair of extreme cases to compare , one with strong quantum correlations while the other has none at all .",
    "it is necessarily true in the djc that a thermal state can not generate entanglement , while a tmss does .",
    "intuition would also suggest that the local entropy destroys entanglement and leads to qualitative sudden death features , while the entanglement generation we observe in the case of a two - mode squeezed state arises from the field - field entanglement being transferred to the atomic subsystem .",
    "the transfer of entanglement from field - field to atoms was analytically verified for a small squeezing approximation of the two - mode squeezed state where one can observe the field - field entanglement going to zero as the atom - atom entanglement builds up .",
    "for initial entangled states we would expect that the correlations of the tmss aid in maintaining the entanglement of an initially entangled state , and we find this to generally be the case , although in some cases for brief periods of time a thermal state can actually result in greater atomic entanglement than the corresponding squeezed states .",
    "as a general result for the class of density matrices that are completely mixed in the fock basis in smsc case , we conclude that in terms of generating entanglement it is preferable to choose an initial atomic state @xmath107 , which has entanglement being al or at the least di , as opposed to @xmath97 where no entanglement is generated .",
    "this had been previously pointed out in the case of fock states and thermal states @xcite .    as an interesting result in terms of entanglement protection",
    ", we find that a single mode squeezed state interacting with symmetrically coupled atoms initially in the state @xmath131 can be extremely effective in protecting the entanglement .",
    "even for the vacuum , this entangled state is al , but as squeezing is increased the minimum entanglement rises monotonically toward maximal entanglement . for entanglement generation by a single mode",
    "squeezed state in the separable atomic initial states @xmath97 and @xmath98 , we found that for a sufficient amount of squeezing entanglement is not only generated but remains al for all future times .",
    "similarly , for a single mode coherent state there is a range of values of the average photon number for which there the generated atom - atom entanglement is al . in these cases ,",
    "it was observed that @xmath107 shows sudden death as squeezing or the average photon numbers were increased .",
    "we have chosen in this analysis to try to isolate the effect of atomic separation on entanglement dynamics from the position - dependent effects arising from boundary conditions .",
    "for this purpose , we have assumed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sysham ] an atom - field coupling that depends on the coordinate separating the atoms only by a phase factor . for clarity",
    "we have supposed our two field modes are traveling - wave modes in free space , however a more experimentally relevant situation would be a toroidal resonator , where there is rotational invariance in the azimuthal direction that satisfies our requirements . in this case",
    "the two modes of interest would be two resonant , counter - propagating whispering - gallery modes .",
    "because strong coupling between an atom and a whispering - gallery modes of a microtoroidal resonator has observed experimentally @xcite , there is the possibility of experimentally probing quite directly the model we have considered .",
    "however , in the experimental system there will be dissipative dynamics arising from emission into other modes outside the resonator , so a detailed comparison would require either including the dissipative effects in the theoretical model or a restriction to the case of sufficiently strong coupling to the resonator modes and early times that the dissipation could be neglected .",
    "our analysis of special cases of the entanglement dynamics arising in two atoms interacting with two modes suggests a wide variety of different behaviors can arise , with qualitative features of the dynamics changing entirely between the two cases , even with the same initial field state .",
    "this suggests that understanding the distance dependence of entanglement dynamics for multiple atoms interacting with a common field will be quite important for predicting even the qualitative features that may arise .",
    "furthermore , if one has the practical goal of dynamically generating entanglement or protecting entanglement once generated , the special cases we have considered suggest that the ability to achieve these goals will be greatly impacted by the separation of the atoms .",
    "having gotten some sense of the variation in behavior that can arise , the obvious next step would be to quantify the entanglement dynamics over a significant range of atomic separations rather than just special or extreme cases .",
    "the variety of qualitative features of entanglement dynamics we have illustrated here argue for the importance of these considerations ."
