    "the development of micro- and nano - robots that can be remotely actuated , navigated and delivered to a given location within the human body , is a leading objective of the modern biomedical applications @xcite .",
    "the idea of using the external magnetic fields for in vitro and in vivo micromanipulation was recognized long ago with the development of the ferrofluids , or colloidal solutions of magnetic nanoparticles @xcite . for a long time , however , the magnetic drag targeting was achieved by the traditional technique based on applying the _ gradient _ magnetic field @xcite . despite some progress in this field , the method proved to be not very effective and convenient primarily due to the need to operate with large gradients of the applied field .",
    "the situation has changed dramatically with the development of the fundamentally new approach to the directed transport of magnetic particles .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the rotating magnetic field even of small or moderate amplitude can be applied for propulsion of _ chiral _ magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "these particles are named  artificial bacterial flagella \" due to their biomimetic helical shape that provides chirality necessary for propulsion @xcite .",
    "the typical propulsion velocities offered by the new technique prove to be four - five orders of magnitude higher than these achieved by the gradient methods ( see scaling arguments in the supporting information ) .",
    "it is not surprising that in the past few years the new technique has attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "physically , the dynamics of the chiral magnetic nanomotors involve two interrelated phenomena of magnetic and hydrodynamic nature , respectively .",
    "it was found in experiments @xcite that at low frequency of the rotating magnetic field the helices wobble about the axis of the field rotation and their propulsion is hindered .",
    "however , upon increasing the field frequency , the wobbling gradually diminishes and a corkscrew - like propulsive motion takes over .",
    "therefore a general search for the optimal nanomotor design should address the questions of optimal choice of magnetic materials , magnetization procedure and helical geometry .",
    "in the recent investigation @xcite one particular aspect of the problem was addressed , namely , a shape optimization of the swimmer geometry maximizing propulsion velocity at given applied magnetic torque assuming perfect alignment of the helix along axis of the field rotation . in the present study",
    "we establish the deep interrelation between the hydrodynamic and magnetic counterparts of the problem and show how it affects the dynamics of nanomotors .",
    "lets consider a behavior of magnetized helix in a rotating magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the longitudinal and transverse components of a helix magnetization are fixed and equal to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we will consider the problem in two different coordinate systems  in the laboratory coordinate system ( lcs ) fixed in space and in the body - fixed coordinate system ( bcs ) rigidly attached to the cylinder mimicking the helix .",
    "we study a helix behavior in the externally imposed rotating uniform magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that in the lcs the field rotates in the horizontal plane @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , correspondingly , the field amplitude and its frequency . specifying both coordinate systems , we will follow to the notation given in the book @xcite .",
    "the coordinate axes of the systems are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we choose @xmath9- and @xmath10 axes of the bcs along the magnetization vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 , thus the magnetic moment @xmath13 of the helix in the bcs has a form @xmath14 the orientation of the bcs relatively to the lck is determined by the euler angles @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite shown in fig .",

    "for simplicity , the cylindrical envelope of a helix is shown .",
    "[ fig:1],scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the magnetized helix is engaged in a rotational motion driven by the magnetic torque @xmath18 .",
    "this torque is a source of both rotational and translational movements of the particle . in the stokes approximation ,",
    "the helix motion is governed by the balance of external and viscous forces and torques acting on the particle @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the translational and angular velocities of helix , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the corresponding viscous friction tensorial coefficients .",
    "we have also assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u1 ] ) that there is no external force acting on the helix",
    ".    the formal solution of the problem can be readily obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u1 ] ) , ( [ eq : u2 ] ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the renormalized matrix of the rotational friction .",
    "thus , the problem of the helix dynamics can be divided into two separate problems : ( i ) rotational motion of achiral slender particle ( i.e. @xmath27 ) , e.g. rod , and ( ii ) translation of a chiral particle rotating with a prescribed angular velocity .    in the following sections we consider both problems .",
    "it is convenient to right down the equation of the rotational motion ( the second equation in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u3 ] ) ) in the body - fixed coordinate system in which the tensor @xmath28 is a diagonal one .",
    "the components of the magnetic field ( [ eq : field ] ) in the bcs are determined from the relation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rotation matrix @xcite ( see the supporting information ) . using data for the components of the angular velocity @xmath31 @xcite and elements of the rotation matrix",
    ", the torque balance equation takes a form : @xmath32 here @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the three characteristic frequencies of the problem .",
    "we assume an arbitrary relation between the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while @xmath36 , which is typical for a slender particle .",

    "generally , an overdamped dynamics of magnetic particles in a rotating magnetic field can be realized via _",
    "synchronous _ and _ asynchronous _",
    "regimes @xcite .",
    "the synchronous regime is observed when there is a constant phase - lag between the euler angle @xmath15 of the particle body and the external magnetic field @xmath3 while the angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 do not depend on time : @xmath39 despite the complex form the system ( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) admits a simple analytic solution in the synchronous regime .",
    "indeed , substituting the ansatz ( [ eq:4 ] ) into ( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) yields the following algebraic system @xmath40 let us further consider the solutions of this system in detail .",
    "this obvious solution corresponds to the following values of the euler angles : @xmath41 , @xmath42 . for these values",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) are satisfied identically , whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) reduces to a relation for the phase angle @xmath43 : @xmath44 the solution of the last equation is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the angle between the total magnetic moment @xmath13 of the particle and its transverse component @xmath11 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ab ] ) : its cosine is given by @xmath48 .",
    "this solution corresponds to a rod rotation about its short axis in the field plane , i.e. , the angle @xmath16 between the long axis @xmath10 of the cylinder and the axis @xmath49 of the magnetic field rotation is equal to @xmath50 ( see panel a in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] ) .",
    "the solution is physically clear . indeed ,",
    "in the low - frequency regime the variations of the rod orientation in space take place quasistatically : each instant the magnetic moment @xmath13 of the rod follows the external magnetic field @xmath3 with some slight phase - lag .",
    "thus , both vectors @xmath13 and @xmath3 prove to be normal to the vector @xmath51 of the field rotation .",
    "this is the low - frequency solution of the problem .",
    "it belongs to the limiting interval of field frequencies @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "when , @xmath53 the synchronous regime switches to the asynchronous one @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to understand this effect is to consider behavior of the angle @xmath54 between the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath3 .",
    "generally , the cosine of this angle reads @xmath55    for the low - frequency solution with @xmath41 , @xmath42 it reduces to @xmath56 where we took into account eq .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) . therefore , @xmath57 is the maximal field frequency of the synchronized plane rotation of the rod .",
    "when @xmath53 , the angle between vectors @xmath13 and @xmath3 achieves its maximal value of @xmath50 and so the magnetic torque @xmath58 .",
    "a further increase of the field frequency leads to the breakdown of the synchronous rotation of the rod since the viscous forces can no longer balance the magnetic forces .",
    "the solution we found , however , is not unique .",
    "there is an additional solution that branches from the present one at the finite value of frequency @xmath59 , i.e. , prior to transition to the asynchronous regime .",
    "this solution will be called the high - frequency branch .",
    "the high - frequency solution is characterized by the euler angle @xmath60 . from the system ( [ eq:5])-([eq:7 ] ) one obtains @xcite @xmath61 the angle between the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath3 reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "since we assumed , @xmath36 , then @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "similarly to analysis above , @xmath66 is the maximal frequency of the synchronous rotation found for high - frequency solution .    which of these two synchronous solutions is selected at high frequencies ?",
    "to clarify this question qualitatively , let us consider two main limiting geometries shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] .    , i.e. , vertical orientation of the rod .",
    "[ fig : ab],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the low - frequency regime , the horizontal plane of field rotation coincides with the plane formed by the magnetization vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the vector of the total magnetic moment @xmath67 follows the external magnetic field @xmath3 in attempt to instantaneously catch up with it and , thereby , _ minimizing the magnetic energy _ of the rotating rod .",
    "taking into account eqs .",
    "( [ eq : angle ] ) and ( [ eq : angle2 ] ) the magnetic energy of the rod in the low - frequency regime reduces to @xmath68    in the high - frequency regime , the energy minimization is achieved differently : the disadvantageous orientation of the longitudinal component @xmath12 ( @xmath69 ) is compensated by the energy gain due to reduced friction associated with rotation about the long axis , compared to rotation about the short axis in the low - frequency regime , @xmath70 assuming for simplicity that @xmath71 , we estimate the minimal value of the frequency @xmath72 starting from which the second regime becomes energetically favorable .",
    "it should be emphasized however that in the above simplified analysis we assumed the orientation of the rod in the high - frequency regime to be vertical and ignored all the intermediate orientations .",
    "actually , the high - frequency solution branches continuously from the low - frequency regime .",
    "nevertheless , the above simplified analysis shows that the transition occurs at @xmath73 in agreement with our estimate .",
    "the aforementioned conclusion found from qualitative reasonings is confirmed also by the rigorous stability analysis ( see the supporting information ) .",
    "it is interesting to note also that the lower values of dissipation correspond to the high - frequency solution in comparison with that for the low - frequency one .",
    "thus , the following scenario of the phenomenon can be pictured . in the low - frequency regime , @xmath74",
    ", the rod keeps rotating synchronously in the plane of the applied magnetic field . at higher frequencies , @xmath75",
    ", the rod rotates also synchronously , while the procession angle @xmath16 between the long axis of the rod and the @xmath49-axis of the field rotation diminishes with the increase in frequency .",

    ". the favorable at low frequencies horizontal orientation of the heavy rod was due to the action of gravity mimicking the longitudinal magnetization @xmath1 in our theory .      in the asynchronous regime all the euler angles are time - dependent , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and the complete set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) should be considered .",
    "the system is complex and the analytical solution is not feasible .",
    "meanwhile , it admits a quite simple approximation .",
    "we shall present here a heuristic approach to the solution of the problem and postpone the detailed analysis to future work .",
    "the key element of our approach to the solution of the dynamical system ( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) at @xmath80 is the different character of time dependence of the three euler angles .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) that the variables @xmath85 and @xmath86 are involved into oscillatory motion .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath87 of oscillations is estimated easily at @xmath88 linearizing eqs .",

    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , determining the dependence @xmath90 describes the appearance of the phase - lag of particle rotation from the rotating magnetic field .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath91 of this phase - lag is proportional to the supercriticality , @xmath92 , ( see below eq .",
    "( [ eq : c4 ] ) ) .",
    "thus , at least in the vicinity of the critical frequency , @xmath93 , i.e. , the angles @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be considered as ` fast ' variables , whereas @xmath90 as a ` slow ' one .",
    "since we are interested only in the long - time dynamics , we can eliminate the fast variables by time - averaging of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1])-([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "first two equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) reduce after coarsening again to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) with the only difference that instead of the dynamical variables @xmath85 and @xmath86 their time - averaged values @xmath94 and @xmath95 are used .",

    "let us next consider to the problem of the translational motion of the helix actuated by the rotating external magnetic field .",
