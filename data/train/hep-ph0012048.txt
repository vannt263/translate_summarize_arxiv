    "recently , a statistical model for the structure of the nucleon was proposed @xcite .",
    "the nucleon was described as a non - interacting gas of valence quarks , sea quarks and gluons in equilibrium .",
    "this picture was then improved by adding finite - size corrections ( fsc ) to the expression for the parton density function ( pdf ) .",
    "these finite size corrections take into account the fact that the gas is enclosed in a finite volume .",
    "the model was successful in reproducing a large body of polarized and unpolarized nucleon structure function data .",
    "since the ideas from statistical mechanics worked well inside one hadron , namely the nucleon , it is quite motivating to test these ideas in other hadrons as well .",
    "however , compared to the vast amount of precise data available for the nucleon , much less is available for others . among hadrons other than the nucleon ,",
    "the pion is the most widely explored .",
    "there exist data on @xmath0 drell - yan production @xcite and prompt photon production in @xmath5 @xcite which have been used by some groups @xcite to obtain parameterizations for pdfs of the pion .",
    "the drell - yan data constrains the shape of the pion valence densities and the prompt photon data constrains the pionic gluon distribution in the large - x region .",
    "these data are , however , not sufficient to fix the gluon and sea in the pion uniquely .",
    "the number of parameters appearing in the expressions for the pdfs obtained from such global fits are very large and with no physical meaning .",
    "hence it is worth investigating the scope of a statistical model which has fewer parameters based on a physical interpretation .    in this letter",
    ", we present a statistical model for the parton distributions in the pion .",
    "the expressions for the pion pdfs are written assuming the pion to be a gas of massless partons .",
    "these are then improved to include fsc as in the case of the nucleon . in principle",
    "the two parameters associated with the fsc can be determined theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , these parameters are sensitive to the equation of motion employed , the boundary conditions on the wave function , shape of the enclosure and details such as whether the particles are strictly massless . in ref.@xcite , in the absence of a complete understanding of the nucleon as a qcd bound state , a practical approach was taken and the two parameters for the nucleon were determined by fitting unpolarized structure function @xmath6 data at one value of @xmath7 . in the case of the pion , due to scarcity of precise experimental data giving direct information on the pion pdfs , we prefer to use as a first guess , the same parameters for the pion as in the case of the proton @xcite .",
    "interestingly , with these parameters we get good quantitative agreement with the available data on pion valence quark distribution and @xmath0 drell - yan production .",
    "the agreement with data is nearly as good as that obtained by the existing parameterizations @xcite .",
    "we visualise the pion to be made up of a gas of massless partons in equlibrium at temperature @xmath8 in a spherical volume @xmath9 with radius @xmath10 .",
    "the parton number density @xmath11 in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) and the density @xmath12 in the pion rest frame are related to each other by , @xmath13 where the superscript @xmath14 refers to the imf , @xmath15 is the pion mass and @xmath16 is the parton energy in the pion rest frame @xcite . using the standard procedure in statistical mechanics to introduce the effects of the finite size of an enclosure , in the expression for the density of states @xcite we write @xmath12 for the pion as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spin - color degeneracy factor , @xmath19 is the usual fermi or bose distribution function @xmath20\\pm 1\\}^{-1}$ ] , @xmath9 is the pion volume and @xmath10 is the radius of a sphere with volume @xmath9 .",
    "we take @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the root - mean - square radius of the pion @xcite .",
    "the three terms in ( 2 ) are the volume , surface and curvature terms , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , in principle , the free parameters of the model . for reasons mentioned in the introduction , though @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be determined theoretically , we prefer to choose these values to be the same as those determined phenomenologically for the proton in ref.@xcite . theoretically this makes sense , as the values @xmath25 and @xmath26 obtained from the fitting procedure in ref.@xcite are close to the values ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) determined theoretically by morse and ingard @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point at the end of the paper .    to determine the values of the temperature and chemical potentials appearing in the distribution function @xmath19",
    ", we consider the fact that any model of the pdfs for the pion has to obey the number and momentum constraints , the former being motivated by the constituent quark picture for mesons at a low scale ( this scale , being our input scale , should not be to too small as compared with @xmath29 to allow for the evolution of the partons densities , hence we choose it to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of the nucleon ) .",
    "if @xmath32 denotes the number of quarks ( antiquarks ) of flavour @xmath33 , then in the case of a @xmath34 for example , the constraints can be given as , @xmath35 the numbers @xmath32 in eqs.(3 - 5 ) are obtained from eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) by integrating the appropriate @xmath11 over @xmath36 .",
    "the momentum fractions are obtained by integrating @xmath37 over @xmath36 .",
    "the temperature @xmath8 and chemical potentials ( @xmath38 ) appearing in eqs.(3 - 6 ) are then not free parameters . for a given set of parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "they are determined uniquely by solving the four coupled non - linear eqs.(3 - 6 ) .    using the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "mentioned above , we obtain @xmath39 mev , @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 in the case of a negatively charged pion .",
    "the left and right hand sides of eqs.(3 - 6 ) with these values of t and @xmath38 , agree with each other up to an accuracy of one part in @xmath42 .",
    "the chemical potentials for antiquarks are determined by using the relation @xmath43 .",
    "the model , described above , fixes the parton distributions in a pion uniquely at an input scale @xmath44 .",
    "it remains to put it to test and compare the predictions with available experimental data . in order to compare with data , the parton distributions",
    "are evolved to different @xmath7 values using the standard dglap evolution equations at next - to - leading order , starting from the input scale @xmath45 .",
    "to start with , we compare the @xmath34 valence quark distribution calculated within the statistical model with the available data at @xmath46 gev@xmath47 . in fig .",
    "1a we show the valence structure function extracted from @xmath48 drell - yan data by the e615 collaboration .",
    "the solid curve corresponding to our calculation of @xmath49 done within the statistical model , shows reasonably good agreement with the e615 data .",
    "our values of @xmath50 are , however , higher than those due to the smrs ( dashed line ) and grs ( dash - dotted line ) parameterizations .",
    "both these parameterizations have determined their valence densities by making a global fit to the @xmath51 drell - yan data . to further compare our valence densities with other calculations , we calculate the first two moments of the pion valence quark distributions given by , @xmath52 in fig .",
    "1b we plot the @xmath7 dependence of the pion valence moments .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to our calculation and the smrs result is shown by the hashed region .",
    "the points with error bars are the results from a lattice qcd calculation @xcite performed at @xmath53 gev@xmath47 .",
    "next , we put the statistical model to test with the @xmath54 drell - yan data .",
    "we calculate the double - differential cross - section @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 . at leading order ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the bjorken @xmath36 variables of the pion and target nucleon respectively .",
    "m is the invariant mass of the muon pair and @xmath60 is the centre of mass energy .",
    "we calculate the drell - yan cross - sections using the full next - to - leading order expressions @xcite and with the choice @xmath61 .",
    "the proton pdfs required for the calculation of the @xmath62 drell - yan cross - sections are also calculated within the statistical model .",
    "both the pion and nucleon pdfs are calculated using the same values of the fsc parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a detailed description of the evaluation of the nucleon pdfs can be found in ref.@xcite . to take into account uncertainties due to normalization and higher order qcd corrections ,",
    "we multiply our cross - sections by the standard @xmath63-factor .",
    "we analyse two different sets of data obtained from a @xmath34 beam incident on a tungsten target , @xmath64 , by the na10 and e615 collaboration .",
    "to make a correct comparison of our calculated cross - sections for @xmath0 with the @xmath65 data , we multiply our cross - sections with a factor @xmath66 .",
    "this form of the correction factor r is consistent with the observed values @xcite of r as shown in ref.@xcite . in fig.2",
    "we compare our calculated results with the na10 data taken at @xmath34 beam momenta of 194 and 286 gev / c . with @xmath63 factors of 1.02 and 1.06 at beam momenta 194 and 286 gev / c respectively , we find reasonably good agreement with data at different values of @xmath67 .",
    "our @xmath63 values are close to those in ref.@xcite which range between 1.1 and 1.4 depending on the type of fit .",
    "a discussion on the @xmath63 factor can be found in ref.@xcite where it was also noted that it should be fairly close to unity . in fig.2",
    "we also show the dependence of the cross sections on the choice of the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the solid curves correspond to @xmath68 and @xmath69 which are the values used throughout this work . varying the parameters arbitrarily we found that the agreement with data reduces as we move away from the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 quoted above .",
    "to demonstrate this fact , we plot the cross sections at beam momentum 286 gev / c for two different sets of @xmath23 and @xmath24 in fig .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to the calculations with @xmath70 , @xmath71 and the dot - dashed curves correspond to those with @xmath72 , @xmath73 .    in fig.3",
    "we show our calculations in comparison with the e615 data at @xmath74 gev / c .",
    "the @xmath63 factor in this case is 0.85 .",
    "it differs from the @xmath63 obtained by us for the na10 data due to normalization errors in the data .",
    "since the ratio @xmath75 in this work is very similar to that obtained in refs.@xcite , we do not worry about the fact that @xmath76 .",
    "as mentioned above it could be due to errors in normalization .",
    "the agreement of our results with data is again quite good .",
    "we are , however , not able to reproduce data at very high or low values of @xmath67 very well . although the reason for this disagreement is not clear to us , it certainly is not a short - coming of the statistical model .",
    "we say so because this kind of disagreement was also found in ref.@xcite .",
    "they included the data only in a certain range of @xmath67 for fitting as they were unable to reproduce the data at very high and low values of @xmath67 .",
    "finally in fig .",
    "4 we compare the valence , sea and gluon distributions of the pion within the statistical model with those obtained by the smrs and grs parameterizations . since the pion sea distributions are not well determined by data , the smrs parameterization made different fits by varying the fraction of the pion momentum carried by the sea between 10% and 20% .",
    "interestingly , we find that the sea calculated within the statistical model carries a fraction roughly equal to 15% of the pion momentum which is like the smrs best fit value .    to summarize",
    ", we can say that we have presented a simple physical model for the pion , using ideas from statistical mechanics .",
    "the only parameters in the description of the pionic parton densities are the two ` finite - size correction ' parameters .",
    "considering the fact that the only two parameters appearing in the model for the pion _ have not been determined by any fit to the pionic data _ , the success of the model in reproducing data on the pion is surprising .",
    "since we use the same parameters for the proton and pion ( for reasons explained in the introduction ) , we have in a sense , a unified model for the proton and pion .",
    "we tried different sets of the values @xmath23 and @xmath24 for the pionic partons and having the same values as that for the proton is an outcome of our work rather than an assumption . at this stage , however , it would be too early to speculate about the significance of this result .",
    "it could be that given a wealth of precise enough data on pionic parton distributions , the ` true ' values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 determined by a fit , will differ from the ones presently used .",
    "however , it is clear from our results that the difference will not be drastic .",
    "it seems therefore that the values for @xmath23 and @xmath24 are always close to the theoretical values , @xmath27 and @xmath28 determined in ref .",
    "this could partly be the reason why the statistical model works so well for the proton as well as for the pion using the same @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "further efforts to understand why the ideas from statistical mechanics work inside hadrons could be worthwhile and could improve our understanding of hadron structure . in future",
    "we intend to understand this point in more detail , by using for comparison a larger set of data ( i.e. prompt photon production ) , by extending the model to other hadrons like kaons and hyperons , and relating their structure functions to fragmentation functions .",
    "this could also settle the issue about the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
