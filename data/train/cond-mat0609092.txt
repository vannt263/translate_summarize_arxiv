    "the nonequilibrium response of the random field ising model ( rfim ) at zero temperature to a smoothly changing external magnetic field has been introduced by sethna et al.@xcite to describe the hysteresis behavior of low - temperature magnets , in particular the property of  return - point memory \" and the power - law scaling characteristic of the  barkhausen noise \" @xcite . in such a description ,",
    "the competition between the quenched disorder and the ferromagnetic interactions induces a very large number of local energy minima in which the system gets trapped .",
    "in the zero - temperature dynamics , no escape by thermal activation is possible and evolution only results from changes in the driving field . instead of wandering to find energetically more favorable states , the system then goes to the closest minimum made accessible by the field change .",
    "the state of the system is history - dependent and the evolution proceeds by  avalanches \" , i. e. , jumps from one mini ! mum to another .",
    "an extensive investigation of this zero - temperature hysteretic behavior of the rfim has been carried out by several authors ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown that the model displays an out - of - equilibrium critical point , with its associated scaling and universality properties .",
    "the critical point separates a strong - disorder regime in which the magnetization curve and the corresponding hysteresis loop is smooth on the macroscopic scale and a weak - disorder regime in which it shows a discontinuous jump at a nonzero value of the external field .",
    "real materials , however , are not at zero temperature .",
    "application of the above picture requires a separation of time scales : the time for `` local equilibration '' , namely the duration of the avalanche that follows a change in the applied field , must be much shorter than the experimental time scale , set by the rate of change of the applied field , which itself must be much less than the characteristic lifetime of the relevant metastable states in which the system is trapped .",
    "the extreme limit of the former condition is the `` adiabatic '' case in which the rate of change of the external field goes to zero .",
    "the extreme limit of the latter condition corresponds to the zero - temperature ( @xmath2 ) dynamics in which no thermally activated escape takes place .",
    "the effect of a finite rate has been fairly extensively studied@xcite ; that of a finite temperature is a tougher issue .    to study the robustness of the scenario found for the @xmath2 rfim with the standard single - spin - flip dynamics",
    ", it has been proposed to consider the nonequilibrium response of the rfim still at @xmath2 , but with dynamics involving possible cooperative flips of several spins@xcite .",
    "in such dynamics , the system can effectively overcome energy barriers that would block it in a one - spin - flip dynamics . even if thermally activated processes are absent , the metastable states visited by the system when the applied field is ramped up or down are a priori different from those reached in the one - spin - flip dynamics .",
    "a simulation of the @xmath2 rfim with 2-spin - flip dynamics on a cubic lattice showed that the change of dynamics yields a significant reduction of the width of the hysteresis loop ( or , in magnetic language , of the coercivity ) , but that the out - of - equilibrium critical behavior is still present and appears , within statistical uncertainty , to belong to the same universality c !",

    ", we study the hysteresis behavior of the rfim on a bethe lattice with a 2-spin - flip dynamics at zero temperature .",
    "we consider a gaussian distribution of the random fields .",
    "our goal is to obtain an exact solution for the main hysteresis loop as a function of disorder strength , and to compare the results with those of the 1-spin - flip dynamics already derived@xcite .",
    "a question that was found intriguing in the latter case is the absence of out - of - equilibrium transition for a bethe lattice with connectivity z=3@xcite .",
    "a transition is found for @xmath3 and no transition occurs when @xmath0 ( the one - dimensional case ) .",
    "the fact that a qualitative change takes place for @xmath4 and not , as found in equilibrium , for @xmath5 is , to the least , unusual .",
    "it casts a doubt on the conjecture that the out - of - equilibrium and equilibrium critical points belong to the same universality class and are controlled by the same fixed point @xcite . !",
    "we thus focus on the bethe lattice with connectivity @xmath1 and we show that an out - of - equilibrium transition does occur in this case with the 2-spin - flip dynamics .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model and the dynamics , contrasting the 2-spin - flip dynamics with the standard 1-spin - flip one and reviewing the main properties of the 2-spin - flip dynamics . the next section is devoted to deriving the self - consistent equations that allow to calculate the main hysteresis loop on a bethe lattice . in section iv , we consider the one - dimensional chain ( @xmath0 ) and in section v , the @xmath1 case . in both cases ,",
    "we compare with the results obtained with the 1-spin - flip dynamics as well as with the equilibrium ( ground state ) behavior . for the connectivity @xmath1 ,",
    "we show that , in contrast with the 1-spin - flip dynamics , the 2-spin - flip dynamics leads to a disorder - induced , out - of - equilibrium transition . finally , in the last sections , we discuss possible extensions of the approach to the calculation of other observables and to more general k - spin - flip dynamics , with an emphasis on the influence of the cooperativ !",

    "we study the rfim on a lattice of connectivity z , with ising spin variables @xmath6 ferromagnetically interacting with their neighbors and subject to both an intrinsic random field and an applied uniform field h. the hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 where the sum @xmath8 is over all distinct  bonds \" of the lattice and the random fields @xmath9 on each site are independently drawn from a gaussian probability distribution of zero mean and variance equal to @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "we consider the limit of zero temperature and the evolution of the system as it is ( adiabatically ) driven by the external magnetic field @xmath12 . at @xmath2 , metastability results from the absence of full equilibration and the presence of several distinct configurations in which the system can be trapped .",
    "it is customary to define such configurations as the local energy minima , namely the states that minimize the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "a useful characterization of the minima consists in sorting them according to the number of spins that must be flipped to yield a lower - energy state .",

    "the ground state of the system on the other hand corresponds to a configuration that is stable with respect to any arbitrary large number of ( simultaneous ) spin flips , _ i. e. _ , to the limit @xmath14@xcite .    for classical spins with no intrinsic dynamics ,",
    "knowledge of the energy landscape is not enough if one does not provide a dynamical rule to explore the landscape . for the problem of interest here ,",
    "most studies have considered the standard 1-spin - flip dynamics . under such dynamics",

    "the spin @xmath16 aligns with the net local field @xmath17 , with @xmath18 where the sum is over all connected neighbors of site @xmath15 .    a natural extension of this dynamics",
    "consists in allowing cooperative flips of pairs of spins .",
    "the system then jumps from one state to another ( via an avalanche ) whenever the former state becomes unstable to the flip of any single spin _ or _ to the simultaneous flip of any single pair of spins .",
    "evolution now proceeds among 2-stable local minima .",
    "new features with respect to the 1-spin - flip dynamics are only introduced when the flipping pair is made up by two neighboring spins , and the local energy to be minimized is then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the local field experienced by @xmath16 without the influence of the neighbor @xmath21 ( the sum in the above expression is over all neighbors of @xmath15 except @xmath22 ) .",
    "the transition of the pair @xmath23 from one state to another under the 2-spin - flip dynamical rule is graphically illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "one can think the dynamics as made of both single - spin - flips and `` irreducibly cooperative '' 2-spin flips .",
    "the former occur whenever the net local field on @xmath16 , @xmath24 , or @xmath21 , @xmath25 , changes sign .",
    "this corresponds to the transitions @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 in the diagram .",
    "an irreducibly cooperative 2-spin - flip involves a pair of neighboring spins which are of the same sign ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) and can not flip individually , i.e. , without the simultaneous flip of the neighbor .",
    "this takes place whenever the net field on the pair of aligned spins , @xmath32 , changes sign in the central region of the diagram : @xmath33 ( condition for forbidding spin @xmath16 to flip individually ) and @xmath34 ( condition for forbidding spin @xmath21 to flip individually ) .",
    "the applied magnetic field is varied until a first pair of spins become marginally stable .",
    "this pair can be represented by a point on the diagram in figure 1 and the further evolution of the pair is dictated by the border that is first attained ( notice that the axes @xmath35 and @xmath36 depend linearly on @xmath12 so that the displacement of the point is always along the @xmath37 diagonal ) .",

    "our goal is to compute the average magnetization as a function of the magnetic field @xmath12 in the lower branch of the hysteresis loop . by using the properties of the dynamics , it is then sufficient to start from a configuration where all spins are down and to follow the relaxation of the spins starting from the outer part of the lattice and progressing inward , toward the origin , until a 2-stable configuration at the given value @xmath12 of the field is reached .",

    "this conditional probability is a function of the external field only ( it is already an average with respect to the random fields ) and it obeys a recursion equation whose fixed point describes the typical behavior on the bethe lattice . deriving the counterpart of this quantity for the 2-spin - flip dynamics is a little tricky . indeed , cooperative flips of pairs of spins couple the levels in a more intricate way .",

    "a simple implementation is to restrict the `` geometry '' of the triplets of spins considered ( all single spins and all pairs of spins being nonetheless checked so that the 3-stable states so obtained are indeed 1- and 2-stable also ) : we have considered triplets formed by a spin and its two direct descendants , without checking triplets formed by a spin , a `` child '' in a given branch and a `` grand - child '' at one more level away ( see figure 2 ) .",

    "this solution generalizes the results already derived for the 1-spin - flip dynamics .",
    "although we have focused on the main hysteresis loop , it is most likely that further exact results are obtainable for other quantities such as minor hysteresis loops and the avalanche size distribution , albeit with considerable technical difficulty .",

    "the width of the main hysteresis loop and the critical value of the disorder depend on the degree of cooperativity of the dynamics , but the overall scenario is unchanged .",

    "the robustness of the main characteristics associated with hysteresis behavior with respect to the spin dynamics suggests a nontrivial organization of the energy landscape .",
    "it was shown for the 1-dimensional chain and conjectured for the general case that the main hysteresis loop of the rfim under 1-spin - flip dynamics is the outer envelope of all the 1-stable states in the magnetization versus applied - field diagram@xcite .",
    "a similar calculation could probably be undertaken for the 2-spin - flip dynamics , but in the absence of such a result , we merely speculate that the main hysteresis loop under @xmath13-spin - flip dynamics is the envelope of all the @xmath13-stable states . on physical ground , and as already shown here for the 2- and 3-spin - flip dynamics , one expects the width of the loop to shrink as the dynamics becomes more cooperative .",
    "one can then picture the organization of the metastable stable states as formed by a succession of envelopes , the @xmath13th envelope being included ! in the @xmath193th and so on , until hysteresis vanishes and the envelope collapses to a curve that coincides with the equilibrium ( ground state ) behavior@xcite . as discussed in ref.@xcite , a jump discontinuity associated with a macroscopic avalanche occurs when there is a reentrant part in the corresponding envelope : a jump in the @xmath13-spin - flip dynamics would then imply a jump in more cooperative dynamics , but not necessarily in less cooperative ones .",
    "the apparently surprising result concerning the bethe lattice with @xmath1 can be interpreted along theses lines : there is a transition for the 2-spin - flip dynamics , and for the 3-spin - flip dynamics and the equilibrium as well , but not for the 1-spin - flip dynamics .",
