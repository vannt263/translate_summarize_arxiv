    "naturally , this suggests that the dual supergravity solution is obtained by considering a periodic configuration of disks with period proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "the integers @xmath33 that specify the gauge theory vacuum now determine the positions and charges of the disks within one period in the obvious manner .",
    "presumably , the sizes of the disks are then fixed by demanding regularity of the supergravity solution . in rest of this paper , we will be interested in the simplest vacuum state of the theory , given by the trivial gauge field @xmath38 for all @xmath39 . in the normalization conventions of lin and maldacena @xcite ,",
    "the dual supergravity solution is generated by the axisymmetric electrostatic potential @xmath40 for an arrangement of equal - sized disks at @xmath41 for all integers @xmath42 , where the charge on each disk is @xmath43 .",
