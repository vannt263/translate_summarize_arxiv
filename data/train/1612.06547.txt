    "the `` obesity paradox '' has been reported in several observational studies , where obesity was shown to be associated to a decreased mortality in individuals suffering from a chronic disease , such as diabetes @xcite or heart failure @xcite .",
    "some biological explanations have been put forward , but causal arguments have recently been given to explain this apparently paradoxical fact @xcite : because the chronic disease is on a causal path between obesity and mortality , conditioning on the value of this mediator can create spurious association , or bias . and",
    "the observed `` protective effect '' of obesity among patients with , say , diabetes , actually has no causal value .",
    "recently , sperrin et al . @xcite relaunch the debate and claim that the resulting bias , the so - called collider bias , is unlikely to be the main explanation for the obesity paradox .",
    "however , we believe there are a number of issues in sperrin et al.s article which make the authors conclusions questionable . we further believe that a thorough description of these issues can be instructive for epidemiologists interested in causal inference .",
    "sperrin et al .",
    "based their arguments on a simple form of the causal model underlying the obesity paradox ; see figure [ fig : dag ] . the four random variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are binary variables , _ e.g. _ corresponding to obesity , diabetes , early death and some ( potentially unobserved ) binary confounder , respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "the authors first consider effects and associations defined on the additive scale . in particular , the association between @xmath3 and @xmath5 given @xmath7 is @xmath8 - e[y| m=1 , a=0].\\ ] ] this quantity can be estimated from data collected from patients with diabetes ( @xmath7 ) , even if @xmath6 is unobserved . as mentioned above ,",
    "several observational studies reported negative estimates for @xmath1 , leading to the obesity paradox .",
    "however , @xmath1 has to be related to a meaningful causal effect for the paradox to be real .",
    "sperrin et al .",
    "then study the bias between @xmath1 and the causal effect of @xmath3 on @xmath5 conditioned on @xmath7 , which they define as @xmath9 - e[y^{a=0}| m=1].\\ ] ] here , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two counterfactual variables or potential outcomes , that one would have been able to observe in the counterfactual worlds @xmath12 and @xmath13 that would have followed the intervention @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively @xcite .",
    "see section [ sec : details ] for the precise definitions of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , under the model of figure [ fig : dag ] .",
    "a first remark is that there is no unique and well - defined intervention @xmath14 or @xmath15 when @xmath3 represents obesity .",
    "as nicely put forwarded in @xcite , this makes causal inference about obesity a particularly difficult task , because assumptions such as consistency , positivity and exchangeability are unlikely to hold @xcite .",
    "here we ignore this problem just as sperrin et al . did : we assume the existence of such an intervention and proceed as usual under structural causal models @xcite .    along their derivation",
    ", it seems that sperrin et al .",
    "assume that @xmath16 is independent of @xmath3 given @xmath7 whereas this is generally not the case under the model of figure [ fig : dag ] , because @xmath4 is a descendant of @xmath3 .",
    "then , they obtain an incorrect expression for @xmath18 and the true bias @xmath19 is generally much larger than what they report ; see section [ sec : error ] below .",
    "as will be shown in section [ sec : simul ] , many configurations of the simple generative model considered by sperrin et al .",
    "lead to an `` observed protective effect '' of obesity among diabetic patients @xmath20 while the causal effect @xmath21 is positive .",
    "stated another way , @xmath20 does not imply @xmath22 under the model considered by sperrin et al . :",
    "if the expression `` obesity paradox '' is intended to mean that the causal effect of obesity on early death , among the patients with chronic disease _ in the actual world _",
    ", is negative , @xmath23 , then there is no way to conclude that this obesity paradox is real from studies reporting a negative value for ( an estimate of ) @xmath1 , because of collider bias .    in other respect ,",
    "the premise that we are interested in @xmath18 is questionable .",
    "indeed , @xmath18 relies on the `` cross - world '' quantities @xmath24 $ ] and its interpretation is not straightforward ( see section [ sec : error_remarks ] ) .",
    "because @xmath4 is a mediator here , alternative causal effects of interest can be found in the literature dealing with mediation analysis .",
    "denoting by @xmath25 the outcome variable we would have been able to observe in the counterfactual world @xmath26 that would have followed the double intervention @xmath27 , the controlled direct effect at @xmath7 is defined as @xmath28 - e[y^{a=0 , m=1}]$ ] .",
    "conditional versions of @xmath29 can be considered as well ( see section [ sec : misconception ] ) .",
    "we show that the bias @xmath30 is typically lower than @xmath31 , and is close to what sperrin et al .",
    "incorrectly described as the bias @xmath31 .",
    "this suggests that if the obesity paradox means that the controlled direct effet @xmath29 is negative , then sperrin et al.s discussion , when applied to the bias between the estimable quantity @xmath1 and the target quantity @xmath29 , is mostly valid . in section [ sec : simul ] , we present numerical results obtained under the same data generation mechanism as sperrin et al . , but we eventually consider additional interaction terms .",
    "for some particular configurations , we obtain @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
