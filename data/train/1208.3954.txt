    "strong electronic correlation and the resulting large quantum fluctuation are proposed to realize such a ground state ,  @xcite especially for low - dimensional systems , but it is not so simple to establish and identify the real materials as spin liquids .",
    "the low - energy structure of these organic compounds is often described in terms of a single - band model crossing the fermi level .",
    "this corresponds to the dimerization limit of the anti - bonding band of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of organic molecules forming the dimer . in this limit",
    ", the system is described by a triangular - lattice structure and the geometrical frustration in the lattice is considered as a possible origin of the quantum fluctuation . on the other hand , however , an appreciable anisotropy of the transfer structure in the triangular lattice has been reported by several _ ab initio _ density functional calculations .",
    "@xcite in addition , a recent dielectric measurement  @xcite suggests that the system exhibits a relaxer - type response at low temperatures , @xmath16@xmath960 k , thus indicating that the charge degree of freedom might bring about some kinds of disorder in the low - energy electronic state .",

    "furthermore , the magnetic torque measurement indicates a pauli paramagnetic - like uniform magnetic susceptibility down to 30 mk ,  @xcite indicating a feature similar to the one - dimensional mott insulator represented by heisenberg or hubbard models at half filling at low temperatures .",
    "such seemingly contradicting experimental data require further careful theoretical analyses on the origin and mechanism of the spin liquid behavior .",

    "the level difference between homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) is small compared to the dimerization gap corresponding to the bonding - antibonding splitting of each orbital  @xcite and the resulting band structure shows unusual level inversion of a pair of the homo - lumo bands .",
    "@xcite then from the lower energy , the homo - bonding ( homo - b ) , lumo - bonding ( lumo - b ) , homo - antibonding ( homo - ab ) , and lumo - antibonding ( lumo - ab ) are stacked separated by a finite gap .",
    "the homo - ab band is half filled and is sandwiched by the lumo - ab and lumo - b bands residing above and below 0.5 ev of the fermi level , respectively [ see fig.[fig1](a ) ] .",

    "in addition , a valence - bond - solid phase exists in similar compounds ,  @xcite where superconductivity appears in the vicinity . on the other hand , the geometrical frustration in the half - filled homo - ab band ,  @xcite as well as interactions at a dimer site and/or between dimer sites , can also be relevant to the survival of the spin - liquid phase . to clarify roles of various factors in the low - energy physics , _ ab initio _ derivation of the low - energy model from first principles is highly desired .    for _ ab initio _",

    "the crpa method is originally formulated in the rpa framework with the constraint for the band degree of freedom to eliminate only the degrees of freedom far from the fermi level in energy .",
    "this is called the band downfolding . in the proposed scheme of the supplementary downfolding , however , the concept of the constraint is additionally relaxed to include the screening by the polarization in the other layers / chains even within the target bands .",

    "l \" and  h \" describe propagators of the low- and high - energy electrons , respectively . in the figure , an electron - hole pair formed in the low- and high - energy bands is displayed .",

    "the vertex is approximated by the single fully screened rpa interaction ; the correction to the polarization is written as an exchange process ( d ) and the additional interaction process for the propagators is written as a single ladder process ( e ) .",
    "let us consider the magnitude of these corrections to the original process .",
    "the polarization is given by @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 being the propagators of the low- and high - energy electrons , respectively , and this magnitude roughly scales as @xmath88 , where @xmath14 is the minimum energy distance of the high - energy band from the fermi level .",
    "we note that , in this estimate , the effect of the transition matrix element is dropped for the simplicity .",
    "similarly , the correction term described in the panel ( d ) is given by @xmath87@xmath86@xmath87@xmath86@xmath89 with @xmath90 being the fully - screened interaction between the low- and high - energy electrons .",
    "@xcite thus , the order of the correction to the original polarization is scaled as @xmath90/@xmath14 .",
    "@xcite from the similar discussion , the order of the correction described in the panel ( e ) is also given as @xmath90/@xmath14 .",
    "this value of @xmath90/@xmath14 is a measure for a stable downfolding from a multiband to a single - band model .",
    "when this value is small , the vertex correction to the crpa interaction can be neglected . on the contrary ,",
    "when the value is large , the crpa downfolding breaks down and one must solve the multiband model directly without reducing to the single - band model .",
    "we show in table  [ param - woverd ] our estimated @xmath91 , where we have approximated @xmath90 by the full rpa form @xmath13 ; in etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 , @xmath13 is calculated as the full - rpa coulomb interaction matrix element between the homo - ab and lumo - b wannier orbitals , and , in @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu(ncs)@xmath2 , @xmath13 is estimated as the matrix element between the homo - ab and homo - b wannier orbitals .",
    "the resulting @xmath92 is as large as 0.3 - 0.5 .",
    "this value is rather large compared to the transition - metal oxides . in the transition - metal oxide , @xmath93 bands ( @xmath94 or @xmath95 bands ) form the low - energy band and the closest high - energy bands consist of oxygen-@xmath49 bands . in this case , the matrix element of the full - rpa interaction @xmath96 between @xmath94/@xmath95 and o@xmath97 orbitals is substantially smaller , because the centers of the wannier orbitals are spatially apart with each other and the full - rpa interaction does not work for such a length scale . on the other hand , in the case of the organic compounds , the wannier orbitals of the low- and high - energy bands",
    "have the same centers and therefore the matrix element for the full - rpa interaction does not disappear .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of the organic compound compared to the transition - metal oxide . as a result , in the case of the organic compound , the downfolding treatment based on crpa to reduce to the single - band model would be insufficient and",
    "the multiband analysis is strongly recommended .",
    "one of the compounds exhibiting quantum spin - liquid behavior is @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu@xmath2(cn)@xmath0 .",
    "the _ ab initio _",
    "parameters for the 3d single - band systems have been derived in ref .. since the homo bonding orbital appears to be entangled with other lower - energy bands , one may need to treat more than two bands for the multi - band description , in contrast to @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu(ncs)@xmath2 , which is left for future studies .",
    "to summarize , in the present paper , we derived the 2d multiband models for etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu(ncs)@xmath2 , with the _ ab initio _ crpa plus mlwo framework suitable for strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the correlation strength for the derived model , ( @xmath7@xmath11@xmath8)/@xmath84 , is estimated as a large value of @xmath91 , as shown in table  [ param - woverd ] , indicating the strongly correlated nature of electrons in these systems .",
    "the transfer structure of etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 is characterized by a lattice of quasi-2d scalene triangular lattice with 1d anisotropy , whereas that of @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu(ncs)@xmath2 approximately has a 2d square - lattice structure with a weaker next - nearest neighbor transfer . to discuss whether the multiband model can be reduced to the single - band model with the usual crpa treatment , we estimated the order of the vertex correction to the crpa interaction .",
    "we found that the vertex process between the target homo - ab band and others [ i.e. , the lumo - ab / lumo - b bands for the pd(dmit)@xmath2 salt and the homo - b band for the @xmath3-bedt - ttf salt ] is not small .",
    "therefore , the multiband model should directly be analyzed , not by reducing to the single - band model , to clarify the realistic correspondence with strongly correlated phenomena including non - fermi liquid behavior , quantum spin liquid phase and/or unconventional superconducting mechanism found in the real organic compounds .",
    "this remains to be explored .",
