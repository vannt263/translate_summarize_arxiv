    "we will always assume that @xmath20 is such that the sobolev embedding @xmath21 holds .",
    "this is true for instance if the injectivity radius is positive and the ricci curvature is bounded below ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.19 ) .",
    "the yamabe constant of @xmath20 is defined as    @xmath22    when @xmath23 this number is always finite ( and non - negative ) and it is bounded above by the yamabe constant of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the metric of constant sectional curvature 1 on @xmath26 , by the well known local argument of t. aubin @xcite .    although yamabe constants have been more often considered and are better understood in the case of closed manifolds , the study of the constants for open riemannian manifolds is also of interest by itself and in connection with the closed case .",
    "a general study of yamabe constants of noncompact manifolds can be found in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite    our main motivation is to understand the yamabe constants of certain non - compact riemannian manifolds which play a central role in the study of the yamabe invariants of closed manifolds ( in particular when studying how the invariants behave under surgery , see @xcite ) . in the present article",
    "we will consider the stability of solutions of the yamabe equation .",
    "a solution @xmath27 of the @xmath12-yamabe equation is a solution of the euler - lagrange equation of @xmath28 which means that for each @xmath29 the function @xmath30 verifies @xmath31 .",
    "the solution @xmath27 is called stable if for every @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the condition is well understood in the closed case : @xmath27 being a solution of the yamabe equation means that @xmath34 has constant scalar curvature and it is stable if and only if @xmath35 , where @xmath6 is the first positive eigenvalue of the positive laplacian of the riemannian metric .",
    "this condition can be expressed also in terms of the original metric @xmath12 , but in the closed case there is no reason to use such expression .",
    "a typical situation of interest in the complete noncompact case is a metric of constant positive scalar curvature and infinite volume for which one is interested in computing the yamabe constant .",
    "a solution of the yamabe equation gives a metric of constant scalar curvature which is non - complete , of finite volume .",
    "since the analysis in such a manifold is not well understood it seems more reasonable to work on the original metric .",
    "therefore we will begin this article by studying the stability condition on a non - compact complete riemannian manifold of constant positive scalar curvature .",
    "we introduce the following invariant :    let @xmath20 be a complete riemannian manifold of constant positive scalar curvature and @xmath36 be a positive smooth critical point of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath37 and define    @xmath38    with this notation the condition for stability reads :    let @xmath20 be a complete riemannian manifold of constant positive scalar curvature and @xmath36 be a positive smooth critical point of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath27 is stable if and only if    @xmath39    to study stability of solutions of the yamabe equation on open manifolds one would need to compute the invariant @xmath40 .",
    "the example we will be most interested in is the case @xmath41 where @xmath42 is closed and @xmath43 has constant scalar curvature which we normalize to be @xmath1",
    ". one can restrict the functional to functions which depend only on the euclidean variable and define as in @xcite    @xmath44    in @xcite @xmath45 is computed in terms of the best constant of the classical gagliardo - nirenberg inequality . in particular",
    "there is a unique @xmath46-minimizer @xmath27 which is a radial , decreasing , smooth function and the scalar curvature of @xmath47 is @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that @xmath48 . in section 2",
    "we will show that the there is a minimizer for @xmath49 and then in section 4 we will show that it is of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath6 is the first positive eigenvalue of @xmath7 .",
    "then we see from theorem 1.2 that :    let @xmath0 be a closed riemannian manifold of constant scalar curvature @xmath1 and @xmath27 the @xmath46-minimizer normalized so that the scalar curvature of @xmath47 is @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath27 is a stable critical point of @xmath52 if and only if    @xmath53    in order to use the previous theorem we will consider the function :    @xmath54    in section 4 we will prove that @xmath55 is realized by a radial decreasing function and then deduce the following :    the infimum is a strictly increasing function of @xmath56 .",
    "therefore there exists a unique value of @xmath57 such that @xmath58    we introduce the following constant which depends only on the dimensions @xmath8 :    the value of @xmath56 given by the previous corollary will be called @xmath4 .",

    "usually one restricts @xmath28 to metrics of some fixed volume . in terms of the function @xmath32 this means that we would consider @xmath32 such that @xmath101 .",

    "in the next sections we will consider the particular case when @xmath121 , a riemannian product of a closed riemmanian manifold of constant positive scalar curvature with the euclidean space , and @xmath27 a critical point of @xmath28 which is a smooth radial decreasing positive function on @xmath122 .",
    "we will use the fact that @xmath40 is achieved :    there exists @xmath123 which achieves the infimum in the definition of @xmath124 .",

    "we can assume that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "also , @xmath133 converges to @xmath129 in @xmath134 , since the sobolev embedding is compact for @xmath131 , and by hlder s inequality .",

    "finally , we remark that the space of solutions is finite dimensional .",
    "suppose it were infinite dimensional , then we would have a sequence @xmath170 of minimizers , such that @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath171 , for every @xmath172 , and for some @xmath155 . by applying the argument of the proof to this sequence",
    ", we would have strong @xmath173 convergence of a subsequence of @xmath170 to some @xmath173 function @xmath174 , contradicting the hypothesis that @xmath171 .",

    "the gagliardo - nirenberg inequality says that there exists a positive constant @xmath182 such that for all @xmath183    @xmath184    the best constant is of course the smallest value @xmath185 that makes the inequality true :    @xmath186    the infimum is actually achieved .",
    "the minimizer is a solution of the euler - lagrange equation of the functional in parenthesis :    @xmath187    by invariance if a function @xmath32 is a minimizer so is @xmath188 given by @xmath189 for any constants @xmath190 . in terms of equation ( 6 ) this means that a solution @xmath32 gives a 2-dimensional family of solutions . by picking @xmath191",
    "appriopriately we can choose the ( constant ) coefficients appearing in the equation .",
    "in particular one would have a solution of    @xmath192    it is known since the classical work of gidas - ni - nirenberg @xcite that all solutions of equation ( 7 ) which are positive and vanish at infinity are radial functions .",

    "we will denote the function @xmath195 by @xmath201 ( in case it is necessary to make it explicit the dependence on @xmath202 ) .",

    "( and the space of solutions of the equation is finite dimensional ) . since @xmath27 depends only on @xmath122 it follows that if @xmath32 is a solution of the equation then @xmath220 is also a solution .",

    "then restricting the variation to @xmath240 the same inequality as in corollary 2.3 gives :                        given any @xmath246 let @xmath247 be its radial decreasing rearrangement .",
    "then since @xmath27 is also radial and decreasing we obtain from the hardy - littlewood inequality that @xmath248 . and as usual @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "it follows that for the minimization we can consider only radial decreasing functions .",
    "let @xmath251 be a sequence of radial decreasing functions such that the corresponding quotient converges to the infimum .",
