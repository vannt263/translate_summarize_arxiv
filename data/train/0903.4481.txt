    "a central topic of past and modern hadron physics is the determination of the wave function of resonances in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom , both in the baryon and meson sectors and both for light and heavy quarks ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the mesonic sector , beyond conventional quark - antiquark ( @xmath1 ) mesons , one has glueball states , multiquark states such as tetraquarks and ` dynamically generated resonances ' , most notably molecular states .",
    "indeed , different authors used the term ` dynamical generation ' in rather different contexts . in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite a dynamical generated state is regarded as a resonance obtained via unitarization methods from a low - energy lagrangian ; in refs .",
    "@xcite it is considered as a state which does not follow the quark - antiquark pattern in large-@xmath0 expansion . in refs .",
    "@xcite the concept of ` additional , companion poles ' as dynamically generated states is introduced , while in refs .",
    "@xcite a dynamically generated resonance is regarded as loosely bound molecular state .",
    "these various definitions are not mutually exclusive and describe different points of view of the problem .    in this article ( sec . ii and iii ) a definition for a dynamically generated state is proposed and its implications , also in connection with the aforementioned works , are presented .",
    "this definition , in turn , leads to a method allowing to distinguish in principle tetraquark and molecular states , although they are both four - quark states . the concept of ` dynamical reconstruction ' is then introduced and discussed : it applies to resonances which are obtained from low - energy effective lagrangians via unitarization methods , but still correspond to ` fundamental ' ( not dynamically generated ) @xmath2 glueball or multiquark states . in this context , the study of the large @xmath0 behavior of these resonance constitutes a useful tool to discuss their nature . in the end of sec .",
    "iii some general thoughts about the form of an effective theory of hadrons valid up to 2 gev are also presented .    in sec .",
    "iv the attention is focused on a simple toy model , in which only two scalar fields are considered .",
    "the parameters of the toy model are chosen in a way that both fields behave as quarkonium - like state in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the heavier state is first integrated out in order to obtain an effective low - energy lagrangian in the toy world and then is reobtained via a bethe - salpeter ( bs ) study applied to the low - energy lagrangian .",
    "it is shown that this is ( at least in some cases ) possible and that the corresponding large @xmath0 behavior can be brought in agreement with the expected large @xmath0 limit ; this is a subtle and interesting issue on its own . however , when only the lowest term of the effective , low - energy lagrangian is retained , the large @xmath0 limit of the reconstructed state is not reproduced : instead of the correct large @xmath0 quarkonium limit ( which must hold by construction ) , it fades out as a molecular state would do .",
    "implications of these results are presented : it is proposed that axial - vector , tensor and ( some ) scalar mesons just above 1 gev obtained via the bs approach from the corresponding low - energy , effective lagrangian in which only the lowest term is kept , are ( reconstructed ) quark - antiquark fields , in agreement with the constituent quark model , although they might fade away as molecular states in the large @xmath0 limit . finally , in sec .",
    "v the conclusions are presented .",
    "consider a physical system which is correctly and completely described in the energy range @xmath3 by a quantum field theory in which n fields @xmath4 @xmath5 their masses and interactions are encoded in a lagrangian @xmath6 .",
    "each lagrangian has such an @xmath7 beyond which it can not be trusted .",
    "in particular , we shall refer to @xmath7 in the following sense : all the masses @xmath8 of the states @xmath9 and the energy transfer in a two - body scattering @xmath9 @xmath10 should be smaller than @xmath7 @xmath11 and , in the s - channel , @xmath12 ) .",
    "moreover , we also assume that : ( i ) the theory is not confining , thus , to each field @xmath9 there is a corresponding , measurable resonance ( and at least one with zero width ) .",
    "( ii ) if not renormalizable , an appropriate regularization shall be specified .    a resonance @xmath13 emerging in the system described by @xmath14 ,",
    "is said to be dynamically generated if it does _ not _ correspond to any of the original fields @xmath4 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath14 in the lagrangian and if its mass @xmath17 lies below @xmath7 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the last requirement @xmath18 is natural because the state @xmath19 can be regarded as an additional , dynamically generated resonance only if it belongs to the energy range in which the theory is valid .",
    "this simple consideration plays an important role in the following discussion . clearly , the dynamical generated state @xmath19 emerges via interactions of the original resonances @xmath20 when switching them off , @xmath19 must disappear .",
    "for this reason a dynamically generated mesonic resonance in qcd fades out in the large-@xmath0 limit , which corresponds to a decreasing interaction strength of mesons , see later for more details .",
    "some examples and comments are in order :    \\(a ) @xmath21 , in which the electron and the photon fields are the basic fields .",
    "this theory is valid up to a very large @xmath7 ( gut scale ) .",
    "positronium states are molecular , electron - positron bound states .",
    "they appear as poles close to the real axis just below the threshold @xmath22 , but slightly shifted due to their nonzero decay widths into photons .",
    "clearly , positronium states are ` dynamically generated ' according to the given definition and should not be included in the original qed lagrangian , otherwise they would be double - counted .",
    "note , the number of positronium states is infinite .",
    "\\(b ) in lagrangians describing nucleon - nucleon interaction via meson exchange ( @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) a bound state close to threshold , called the deuteron , emerges via yukawa - interactions , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "the deuteron is a dynamically generated molecular state . in this case , when lowering the interaction strength below a critical value ( by reducing the coupling and/or increasing the mass of the exchanged particle(s ) ) , the bound state disappears .",
    "in fact , the number of molecular states which can be obtained via a yukawa potential is finite @xcite , and eventually zero if the attraction is too weak . in such models",
    "the deuteron should not be included in the original lagrangian in order to avoid double - counting @xcite .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath27 the fermi theory of the weak interaction , in which the neutrino and electron fields interact via a local , quartic interaction .",
    "this theory is valid up to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the boson mediator of the weak force . as already mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the linear rise of the @xmath30 cross section -as calculated from @xmath31- shows a loss of unitarity at high energy .",
    "unitarization applied to @xmath31 implies that a resonance well above @xmath7 exists , and this resonance is exactly the @xmath29 meson .",
    "however , being @xmath32 one can not state in the framework of the fermi theory if the @xmath29 meson is dynamically generated or not . a straightforward way to answer this question",
    "is the knowledge of the corresponding theory valid up to an energy @xmath33 of course , this theory is known : it is the electroweak theory described by the lagrangian @xmath34 , which is part of the standard model @xcite and is valid up to a very high energy ( gut scale ) . in the framework of @xmath34 the neutrino ,",
    "the electron and the @xmath29 meson are all elementary fields .",
    "one can then conclude that the @xmath29 meson is not a dynamically generated state .",
    "indeed , @xmath31 can be seen as the result of integrating out the @xmath29 field from the electroweak lagrangian @xmath34 .",
    "unitarization arguments applied to the fermi lagrangian @xmath35 allow in a sense to ` dynamically reconstruct ' the @xmath36 which is already present as a fundamental field in @xmath34 .",
    "\\(d ) it is important to discuss in more depth and to formalize the issue raised in the previous example . to this end",
    "let us consider the lagrangian @xmath37 as the low - energy limit of a lagrangian @xmath38 valid up to an energy @xmath39 beyond the fields @xmath40 @xmath41 depends also on the fields @xmath42 , which are heavier than @xmath7 .",
    "formally , when integrating out the fields @xmath42 from @xmath41 one obtains @xmath14 .    in general , a unitarization scheme uses the information encoded in a low - energy effective lagrangian and the principle of unitarity in quantum field theories , in order to deduce the existence and some properties of resonances beyond the limit of validity of the theory itself .",
    "when applying a unitarization scheme to the lagrangian @xmath14 , an energy window between @xmath43and a new energy scale @xmath44 - which depends on the detail of the unitarization- becomes ( partially ) accessible . for our purposes , we assume that @xmath45 .    let @xmath19 be a resonance with mass @xmath46 obtained from @xmath14 via a unitarization approach .",
    "is this resonance @xmath19 dynamically generated or not ?",
    "a straightforward way to answer this question would be the knowledge of @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath19 corresponds to one of the fields @xmath42 is not dynamically generated and vice - versa .",
    "however , if @xmath41 is not known it is not possible to answer this question at the level of the unitarized version of @xmath14 only .    in conclusion , although the unitarization approach opens a window between @xmath43and @xmath47 and the existence of resonances in this range can be inferred from the unitarized lagrangian @xmath14 only , still the knowledge of the latter is not complete @xcite . if @xmath48 is unknown , some other kind of additional information is required to deduce the nature of @xmath19 . in the framework of low - energy qcd",
    "this additional information can be provided by large-@xmath0 arguments , see sec .",
    "\\(e ) let us consider a scalar field @xmath49 in a 1 + 1 dimensional world @xmath50 subject to the potential @xmath51 we assume that this theory is valid up to high energies .",
    "when expanding around one of the two minima @xmath52 the mass of @xmath53 is found to be @xmath54 in addition , this theory admits also a soliton with mass @xmath55 which is large if @xmath56 is small @xcite . in this example",
    "the solitonic state with mass @xmath57 can be regarded as a ` dynamically generated state ' .",
    "\\(f ) mixing can take place among two ` fundamental fields ' @xmath9 and @xmath58 : two physical resonances arise as an admixture of these two fields .",
    "one is predominantly @xmath9 and the other predominantly @xmath59 also , mixing can take place among a dynamically generated resonance @xmath19 and one ( or more ) of the @xmath20 it decreases when the interaction is lowered ( large-@xmath0 limit in the mesonic world ) : one state reduces to the original , preexisting resonance and the other disappears . in conclusion ,",
    "mixing surely represents a source of technical complication which renders the identification of states ( extremely ) more difficult , but it does _ not _ change the number of states and the meaning of the previous discussion .",
    "let us turn to the hadronic world below 2 gev .",
    "the basic ingredients of each low - energy hadronic lagrangian are quark - antiquark mesons and three - quark baryons . in the framework of our formalism",
    ", we shall consider each quark - antiquark ( 3-quark ) state as a fundamental state , which is described by a corresponding field in the hadronic lagrangian ( as long as its mass is below an upper energy @xmath7 ) .",
    "let us formalize this point in the mesonic sector as it follows .",
    "consider the correct , effective theory describing mesons up to @xmath60 gev given by @xmath61{c}% , \\end{array } \\label{1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the number of colors .",
    "its precise form is , unfortunately , unknown .",
    "in fact , because confinement has not yet been analytically solved , it is not possible to derive @xmath62 from the qcd lagrangian . in the limit @xmath63 the effective lagrangian @xmath64 is expected to be more simple .",
    "although even in this limit a mathematical derivation is not possible , it is known that it must primarily consists of non - interacting quark - antiquark states .",
    "in fact , their masses scale as @xmath65 and their decay widths as @xmath66 respectively @xcite . considering that the @xmath1 mass scales as @xmath67 these states shall be clearly present also when going back from the large @xmath0 limit to the physical world @xmath68 the next - expected states which are present in the large @xmath0 limit are glueballs , i.e. bound states of pure gluonic nature .",
    "their masses also scale as @xmath65 and the decay widths as @xmath69 they thus are also expected to be present in the real world for @xmath68 in particular , the lightest glueball is a scalar field which is strongly related to the trace anomaly , i.e. the breaking of the classical dilatation invariance of the qcd lagrangian ( see also sec .",
    "in addition to quark - antiquark and glueball states , also hybrid states survive in the large-@xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "they constitute an interesting subject of meson spectroscopy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) , but will not be considered in the following discussion .",
    "all these states are therefore ` preexisting ' and not - dynamically generated states of the mesonic lagrangian under consideration .",
    "an intermediate comment is devoted to baryon states : they have an linearly increasing mass with @xmath0 ( @xmath70 ) which exceeds @xmath7 for a large enough @xmath0 and are therefore not present in the large-@xmath0 limit of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , although they appear in the @xmath71 world , they are not present in the effective lagrangian because of the way in which the limit is constructed . if , instead , we construct the large @xmath0 limit as @xmath72 ( in such a way that at @xmath71 it coincides with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) , baryons are well defined states as proved originally in ref . @xcite . for simplicity baryons will not be discussed in this paper , but together with hybrid states , should be included in a more complete treatment .",
    "the reason why the value @xmath60 gev is chosen is that all the resonances under study in this work are lighter than 2 gev .",
    "thus , they either correspond to a field in @xmath73 or arise as additional resonances ( i.e. dynamically generated ) via interaction of preexisting states of @xmath74 .",
    "the full knowledge of the lagrangian @xmath75 gev@xmath76 would allow to answer if a resonance lighter than 2 gev is dynamically generated or not by a simple look at it .",
    "clearly , if one would be interested in a resonance whose mass is heavier than 2 gev , then @xmath7 should be increased .",
    "moreover , one expects to find below 2 gev all the relevant ground - state mesons in the channel @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 , @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "thus , @xmath82 gev@xmath83 may be described by an effective lagrangian which exhibits linear realization of chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breakdown , see section iii.d for a closer discussion .",
    "most of the mesonic resonances listed in the particle data group @xcite can be immediately associated to a corresponding , underlying quark - antiquark state . yet , the question if some resonances of ref .",
    "@xcite are not @xmath1 is interesting and at the basis of many studies . in the mesonic sector ,",
    "two alternative possibilities are well - known :    @xmath84 molecular states : they are bound state of two distinct quark - antiquark mesons .",
    "they correspond to the example of the positronium ( example ( a ) sec .",
    "just as the positronium states are not included in the qed lagrangian , hadronic molecular states should _ not _ be included directly in @xmath85 they arise upon meson - meson interactions in the @xmath71 physical world , see the general discussion above .",
    "however , they inevitably fade out in the large-@xmath0 limit because the interaction of a n - leg meson vertex decreases as @xmath86 this is therefore a clear example of dynamically generated states within a mesonic system ( see also the next subsection for a closer description of physical candidates below 1 gev ) .",
    "@xmath84 tetraquark states : they consist of two distinct , colored ` bumps ' , in contrast to a molecular state , which is made of two colorless , quark - antiquark bumps @xcite",
    ". loops of @xmath1 mesons , corresponding to the interaction of two colorless states , can not generate the color distribution of a tetraquark .",
    "if present at @xmath71 , they shall be included directly in the effective lagrangian @xmath87 and , in view of the given definition , should not be regarded as dynamically generated states .    a second , slightly different way to see",
    "it is the following : let us imagine to construct the lagrangian @xmath88 we first put in quark - antiquark and glueball states , that is those configurations which surely survive in the large-@xmath0 limit and corresponds to non - dynamically generates states : @xmath89 then the question is : ` does this lagrangian describe the physical world for @xmath71 ' ? ( note , loops shall be taken into account and dynamically generated states can eventually emerge out of this lagrangian . )",
    "if the answer is positive , no multiquark states are needed .",
    "if the answer is negative , the basic lagrangian shall be extended to include from the very beginning multiquark states , most notably tetraquark states : @xmath90    a third approach to the problem goes via large-@xmath0 arguments . in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that a tetraquark state also vanishes in the large-@xmath0 limit . however , for @xmath71 the most prominent and potentially relevant for spectroscopy is the ` good ' diquark , which is antisymmetric in color space : @xmath91 ( with @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the tetraquark is the composition of a good diquark and a good antidiquark : @xmath93 .",
    "the extension to @xmath0 of a good diquark is the antisymmetric configuration @xmath94 with @xmath95 which constitutes of @xmath96 quarks .",
    "thus , the generalization of the tetraquark to the @xmath0 world is not a diquark - antidiquark object , but the state @xmath97 which is made of @xmath96 quarks and @xmath96 antiquarks , see also the discussion in ref .",
    "it is the dibaryonium already described in ref .",

    "the state @xmath99 while not present in @xmath100 because its mass overshoots @xmath7 , appears in @xmath101 in which also the baryons survive : this is contrary to a dynamically generated state , which disappears also in this case .    as a result of our discussion , tetraquark states and molecular states , although both formally four - quark states , are crucially different : the former are ` elementary ' and should be directly included in the effective lagrangian @xmath87 , the latter can emerge as dynamically generated resonances .",
    "we now turn to the particular case of the light scalar mesons , where all these concepts play an important role .",
    "one of the fundamental questions of low energy qcd concerns the nature of the lightest scalar states @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 shall these states be included from the very beginning in @xmath106 ?",
    "if yes , they correspond to quark - antiquark or tetraquark nonets ( one of them can be also related to a light scalar glueball ) .",
    "if not , they shall be regarded as dynamically generated states .",
    "the main point of the following subsection is to discuss previous works about light scalar mesons in connection with the proposed definition of dynamical generation .",
    "in fact , it is easy to classify previous works into two classes ( not dynamically generated and dynamically generated ) , thus allowing to order different works of the last three decades in a clear way .",

    ", one reconstructs these heavier resonances by unitarizing the appropriate low - energy lagrangian .    within a simple toy model",
    "these issues have been examined .",
    "this model consists of two fields , @xmath53 and @xmath328 with the latter being heavier and with a nonzero decay width into @xmath329 we introduced a large-@xmath0 dependence which mimics that of quarkonium states in qcd .",
    "the field @xmath206 has been first integrated out and the emerging low - energy interaction lagrangian involving only the field @xmath53 has been derived . out of it",
    "the state @xmath206 has been ` dynamically reconstructed ' .    in order to do it",
    "we have used a unitarization inspired by the bethe - salpeter equation and we have shown that the original , quarkonium - like large-@xmath0 behavior of @xmath206 can not be reproduced if only the lowest term in the effective lagrangian is kept .",
    "( note , when more terms are kept this problem can be easily solved and the large @xmath0 result is correct also within the bs approach .",
    "the problem is not the latter but the adopted perturbative expansion , see sec iv.a ) .",
    "we then proposed that a similar , although more complicated , dynamical reconstruction mechanism takes place for tensor , axial - vector and scalar mesons above 1 gev : these resonances , studied in recent works , can be interpreted as fundamental quark - antiquark states , which are reobtained when unitarizing low - energy effective lagrangians . in this scenario",
    "there is no conflict between the ` old ' quark model assignments and recent developments , because they would both represent a dual description of the same , preexisting quark - antiquark resonances .",
    "this interpretation , although not yet conclusive , represents a possibility which deserves further study .",
    "dynamical reconstruction can also hold for light scalar mesons below 1 gev , if the latter form a quarkonium ( quite improbable ) or a tetraquark nonet .",
    "the situation in this case is , as discussed in the text , still unclear . in this work we limited the study to the light mesonic sector , but the present discussion about dynamical generation / reconstruction can also hold , with due changes , in the baryon and in the heavy quark sectors .",
