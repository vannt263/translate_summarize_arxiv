    "this paper arose from the attempt to find the simplest riemannian metric on the space of 2-dimensional ` shapes ' . by a shape",
    "we mean a compact simply connected region in the plane whose boundary is a simple closed curve . by requiring that the boundary curve has various degrees of smoothness , we get not just one space but a whole hierarchy of spaces",
    ". all these spaces will include , however , a core , namely the space of all shapes with @xmath11 boundary curves .",
    "we expect that the most natural shape spaces will arise as the completions of this core space in some metric hence we take this core as our basic space .",
    "note that it is the orbit space @xmath12 of the space of all @xmath11 embeddings of @xmath0 in the plane , under the action by composition from the right by diffeomorphisms of the circle .",
    "the space @xmath13 is a smooth manifold , in fact an open subset of the frchet space @xmath14 , and it is the total space of a smooth principal bundle with base @xmath15    in fact , most of our results carry over to the bigger orbit space of immersions mod diffeomorphisms : @xmath16 this action is not quite free ( see ! 2.4 and ! 2.5 ) , hence this orbit space is an orbifold ( see ! 2.5 ) and not quite a manifold .",
    "there is the slightly smaller space @xmath17 ( see ! 2.1 ) of immersed curves where diffeomorphisms act freely , the total space of a principal fiber bundle with a natural connection admitting parallel transport . existence of horizontal curves , however , holds also in the big space @xmath18 ( see !",
    "2.5 ) which will be one of the weapons in our hunt for geodesics on @xmath19 .    the second author was led to study the space @xmath20 from its relevance to computer vision .",
    "to understand an image of the world , one needs to identify the most salient objects present in this image .",
    "in addition to readily quantifiable properties like color and area , objects in the world and their projections depicted by 2d images possess a ` shape ' which is readily used by human observers to distinguish , for example , cats from dogs , bmw s from hondas , etc .",
    "in fact people are not puzzled by what it means to say two shapes are _",
    "similar _ but rather find this a natural question .",
    "this suggests that we construct , on some crude level , a mental metric which can be used to recognize familiar objects by the similarity of their shapes and to cluster categories of related objects like cats .",
    "incidentally , immersions also arise in vision when a 3d object partially occludes itself from some viewpoint , hence its full 2d contour has visible and invisible parts which , together , form an immersed curve in the image plane .    it is a central problem in computer vision to devise algorithms by which computers can similarly recognize and cluster shapes .",
    "many types of metrics have been proposed for this purpose ! 7 .",
    "for example , there are @xmath21-type metrics such are the area of the symmetric difference of the interiors of two shapes .",
    "and there are @xmath22-type metrics such as the hausdorff metric : the maximum distance of points on either shape from the points on the other or of points outside one shape from points outside the other .",
    "these metrics will come up below , but the starting point of this investigation was whether one could use the manifold structure on the space of shapes and define an @xmath23-type metric by introducing a riemannian structure on the space .",
    "such questions have also arisen in teichmller theory and string theory , where the so - called weil - peterssen metric on the space of shapes ( also called the ",
    "universal teichmller space ) has been much studied . in a second part of this paper , we will compare our metric to this remarkable ( homogeneous ! ) metric .    in this paper , we sought the absolutely simplest riemannian metric that the space @xmath19 supports .",
    "the most obvious @xmath24-invariant weak riemannian metric on the space of immersions is the @xmath25-metric : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an embedding defining a point in @xmath20 and @xmath5 are vector fields along the image curve , defining two tangent vectors to @xmath28 at @xmath4 .",
    "this induces a @xmath24-invariant weak riemannian metric on the space of all immersions and on @xmath13 , and for the latter space it induces a weak riemannian metric on the base manifold @xmath20 .",
    "surprisingly , the riemannian distance defined as the infimum of the arclength of paths connecting two points in @xmath15 turns out to be 0 , see ! 3.10 !",
    "this seems to be one of the first examples where this purely infinite dimensional phenomenon actually appears .",
    "motivated by the proof of this result ! 3.10",
    "we are led to consider the invariant riemannian metric !",
    "3.2.6 for a constant @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath29 is the curvature of @xmath4 at @xmath30 .",
    "we will argue that this induces a reasonable metric on @xmath15 , as the infimum of arclengths of paths connecting distinct points is always positive .",
    "another reason is that the length function @xmath31 has the following lipschitz estimate !",
    "3.3.2 with respect to this riemannian distance : @xmath32 in fact , one can bound the frchet distance between two curves in terms of this metric ( see ! 3.5 ) .",
    "the completion of the space of smooth curves in this metric contains all curves for whose curvature exists weakly as a finite signed measure ( e.g.  piecewise @xmath33 curves ) and is contained in the space of lipschitz maps from @xmath0 to @xmath34 modulo a suitable equivalence relation , see ! 2.11 .    the geodesic equation for the metric @xmath35 on @xmath13 and on @xmath15 can be found in ! 4.1.1 : it is a highly non - linear partial differential equation of order 4 with degenerate symbol , but which nonetheless seems to have a hypoelliptic linearization . if @xmath7 , the equation reduces to a non - linear second order hyperbolic pde , which gives a well defined local geodesic spray . for any @xmath36 ,",
    "the sectional curvature on @xmath15 has an elegant expression which can be found in ! 4.6.2 and !",
    "it is non - negative if @xmath7 and , for general @xmath36 , becomes strictly negative only if the curve has large curvature or the plane section has high frequency .",
    "of course we would have liked to solve the problem of existence and uniqueness of geodesics for @xmath8 .",
    "we can , however , translate the minimization of path length in our metric into an anisotropic plateau - like problem : in ! 3.12 we show that a curve projects onto a geodesic in @xmath15 if and only if its graph in @xmath37\\x \\mathbb r^2 $ ] is a surface with given boundary at @xmath38 and @xmath39 which is critical for the anisotropic area functional ! 3.12.3 .    in ! 5.1 we determine the geodesic running through concentric circles and the equation for jacobi vector fields along this geodesic .",
    "the solution of the ordinary differential equation !",
    "5.1.1 describing this geodesic can be written in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "this geodesic is no longer globally minimizing when the radius of the circles is large compared to @xmath40 and has conjugate points when it hits this positive curvature zone . in !",
    "5.2 we study geodesics connecting arbitrary distant curves , hence requiring long translations .",
    "the middle part of such geodesics appear to be approximated by a uniformly translating ` cigar'-like curve with semi - circular ends of radius @xmath40 connected by straight line segments parallel to the direction of translation .",
    "these figures were found by numerically minimizing a discrete form of the energy functional ! 3.12.1 .    finally , in ! 5.3 and !",
    "5.4 , we have some further pictures of geodesics .",
    "first we examine the formation of singularities when a small perturbation is propagated forward and @xmath7 .",
    "then we look at some geodesic triangles in @xmath20 whose vertices are ellipses with the same eccentricity and center but different orientations . for various values of @xmath36",
    ", we find that these triangles have angle sums greater and less than @xmath41 .",
    "it is often convenient to use the identification @xmath42 , giving us : @xmath43 we shall use the following spaces of @xmath11 ( smooth ) diffeomorphisms and curves , and we give the shorthand and the full name :    @xmath24 , the regular lie group ( ! 4 ,  38.4 ) of all diffeomorphisms @xmath44 with its connected components @xmath45 of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms and @xmath46 of orientation reversing diffeomorphisms .",

    "its length is easily seen to be : @xmath739 we need to work out its covariant derivative : @xmath740 using a formula for the christoffel symbol which we get from ! 4.2.2 by polarizing , and noting that @xmath741 , we get : @xmath742 ( this formula also follows from the fact that the vectors @xmath743 have length independent of @xmath60 , hence covariant derivative zero . ) jacobi s equation is therefore : @xmath744 where @xmath269 is the curvature tensor . for later purposes ,",
    "it is convenient to write this eqation using @xmath131 as the independent variable along the geodesic rather than @xmath60 and think of @xmath204 as a function of @xmath131 .",
    "note that for any function @xmath207 along the geodesic , @xmath745 and @xmath746 then a somewhat lengthy bit of algebra shows that : @xmath747    to work out the structure of @xmath269 in this case , use the fact that the circles @xmath720 and the vector field @xmath748 are invariant under rotations .",
    "this means that the map @xmath749 has the two properties : it commutes with rotations and it is symmetric .",
    "the only such maps are diagonal in the fourier basis , i.e.  there are real constants @xmath750 such that @xmath751 to evaluate @xmath750 , we take the inner product with @xmath752 ( or @xmath753 and use our calculation of @xmath754 in section ! 4.6 to show :",
    "@xmath755 where @xmath756 simplifying , this gives : @xmath757 hence @xmath758 thus for @xmath759 ,",
    "if we combine everything , jacobi s equation reads : @xmath760    calling the right hand side the _ potential _ of jacobi s equation , we can check that for each @xmath516 , the potential is positive for small @xmath131 , negative for large @xmath131 and it has one zero , approximately at @xmath761 for large @xmath516 .",
    "thus , for small @xmath131 , these perturbations diverge from the geodesic of circles . for large @xmath131 , if we write @xmath762 , then jacobi s equation approaches : @xmath763 this is solved by @xmath764 where @xmath765 are solutions of @xmath766 . for @xmath767 , @xmath765",

    "the first zero of this solution is about @xmath773 , making it a conjugate point of @xmath774 . for other",
    "@xmath516 , the first such conjugate point appears to be bigger , so we conclude : on any segment @xmath775 , the geodesic of circles is locally ( and presumably globally ) minimizing .      for any two distant curves",
    "@xmath776 , one can construct paths from one to the other by ( a ) changing @xmath292 to some auxiliary curve @xmath777 near @xmath292 , ( b ) translating @xmath777 without modifying it to a point near @xmath296 and ( c ) changing the translated curve @xmath777 to @xmath296 .",
    "if @xmath292 and @xmath296 are very far from each other , the energy of the translation will dominate the energy required to modify them both to @xmath777 .",
    "thus we expect that a geodesic between distant curves will aymptotically utilize a curve @xmath777 which is optimized for least energy translation",
    ". to find such curves @xmath777 , heuristically we may argue that it should be a curve such that the path given by all its translates in a fixed direction is a geodesic .",
    "such geodesics can be found as special cases of the general geodesic .",
    "we fix @xmath778 as the direction of translation and assume that the path @xmath779 is a geodesic . we need to express this geodesic up to order @xmath780 in the chart used in section ! 4.4 .",
    "let @xmath781 be arc length parametrization of @xmath777 and @xmath782 be the orientation of @xmath777 at point @xmath781 , i.e.  @xmath783 .",
    "then a little calculation shows that if we reparametrize nearby curves via @xmath784 , then the path of translates in direction @xmath139 is just : @xmath785 thus , in the notation of ! 4.2 , @xmath786 , hence @xmath787 and , moreover , @xmath788 .",
    "substituting this in the geodesic formula ! 4.2.1 , we get @xmath789 since @xmath790 , this becomes , after some manipulation , a singular third order equation for @xmath782 : @xmath791 one solution of this equation is @xmath792 , i.e.  a circle of radius @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , this seems to be the only simple closed curve which solves this equation .",
    "however , if we drop smoothness , a weak solution of this equation is given by the @xmath793 , piecewise @xmath33-curve made up of 2 semi - circles of radius @xmath40 joined by 2 straight line segments parallel to the vector @xmath139 and separated by the distance @xmath794 ( as in figure 5 ) .",
    "note that such ` cigar'-shaped curves can be made with line segments of any length .      a numerical approach to minimize @xmath795 for variations @xmath4 with initial and end curves circles at a certain distance produced the two such geodesics shown in figure 5 .",
    "note that the middle curve is indeed close to such a ` cigar'-shape .",
    "however , the width of this shape is somewhat greater than @xmath794 : this is presumably because the endcurves of this path are not sufficiently far apart .",
    "thus experiments as well as the theory suggest strongly that geodesics joining any two curves sufficiently far apart compared to their size asymptotically approach a constant ` cigar'-shaped @xmath793-intermediate curve made up of 2 semi - circles of radius @xmath40 and 2 parallel line segments .",
    "we conjecture that this is true .",
    "we have seen above that the geodesic spray is locally well - defined when @xmath7 . to understand this spray and see whether it appears to have global solutions",
    ", we take that the initial curve contains a segment with curvature identically zero , i.e.  contains a line segment , and that the initial velocity @xmath204 is set to a smooth function with compact support contained in this segment . for simplicity , we take the velocity @xmath204 to be a cubic b - spline , i.e.  a piecewise cubic which is @xmath33 with 5 non-@xmath796 knots approximating a gaussian blip .",
    "the result of integrating is shown in figure 6 .",
    "note several things : first , where the curvature is zero , the curve moves with constant velocity if we follow the orthogonal trajectories .",
    "secondly , where the curve is moving opposite to its curvature ( like an expanding circle , the part in the middle ) , it is deccelerating ; but where it is moving with its curvature ( like a contracting circle , the parts on the 2 ends ) , it is accelerating . this acceleration in the 2 ends , creates higher and higher curvature until a corner forms . in the figure ,",
    "the simulation is stopped just before the curvature explodes . in the middle",
    ", the curve appears to be getting more and more circular . as the corners form",
    ", the curve is approaching the boundary of our space .",
    "perhaps , with the right entropy condition , one can prolong the solution past the corners with a suitable piecewise @xmath793-curve .",
    "although this calculation assumes @xmath7 , one will find very similar geodesics when @xmath36 is much smaller than @xmath797 and @xmath798 , so that the dominant terms in the geodesic equation are those without an @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , geodesics between large smooth curves are basically the same as those with @xmath7 .      we have examined dilations , translations and the evolution of blips .",
    "we look next at rotations . to get a pure rotational situation , we consider ellipses centered at @xmath799 with the same eccentricity 3 and maximum radius 1 , but differently oriented .",
    "we take 3 such ellipses , with orientations differing by @xmath800 and @xmath801 degrees . joining each pair by a geodesic",
    ", we get a triangle in @xmath20 .",
    "we wanted to examine whether along the geodesic joining 2 such ellipses ( a ) one ellipse rotates into the other or ( b ) the initial ellipse shrinks towards a circle , while the final ellipse grows , independently of one another .",
    "it turns out that , depending on the value of @xmath36 , both can happen .",
    "note that we get similar geodesics by either changing @xmath36 or making the ellipses smaller or larger with @xmath36 held fixed . for each @xmath36",
    ", we get an absolute distance scale with unit @xmath802 and , if the ellipses are bigger than this , ( b ) dominates , while , if smaller , ( a ) dominates .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7 .",
    "we have taken the three values @xmath803 and @xmath804 .",
    "for each value , on the top , we show the geodesic joining 2 of the ellipses as a sequence of curves in their common ambient @xmath34 . below this",
    ", we show the triple of geodesics as a triangle , by displaying the intermediate curves as small shapes along lines joining the ellipses .",
    "this euclidean triangle is being used purely for display , to indicate that the computed structure is a triangle in @xmath20 .",
    "note that for @xmath805 , the intermediate shapes are very close to ellipses , whose axes are rotating ; while for @xmath806 , the bulges in one ellipse shrink while those of the other grow .",
    "we can also compute the angles in @xmath20 between the sides of this triangle .",
    "they work out to be @xmath807 when @xmath805 , i.e.  the angle sum for the triangle is @xmath808 , much less than @xmath41 radians , showing strong negative sectional curvature in the plane containing this triangle .",
    "but if @xmath809 or @xmath804 , the angle is @xmath810 and @xmath811 respectively , giving more than @xmath41 radians in the triangle .",
    "thus the sectional curvature is positive for such small values of @xmath36 .",
    "all simulations in this paper were carried out in matlab .",
    "the forward integration for the geodesic equation for @xmath7 was carried out by the simplest possible finite difference scheme .",
    "this seems very stable and reliable . solving for the geodesics",
    "was done using the matlab minimization routine fminunc using both its medium and large scale modes .",
    "this , however , was quite unstable due to discretization artifacts . a general path between two curves",
    "was represented by a matrix of points in @xmath34 , approximating each curve by a polygon and sampling the path discretely .",
    "the difficulty is that when the polygons have very acute angles , the discretization tends to be highly inaccurate because of the high curvature localized at one vertex .",
    "initially , in order to minimize the number of variables in the problem , we tried to use small numbers of samples and higher order accurate discrete approximations to the derivatives .",
    "in all these attempts , the discrete approximation `` cheated '' by finding minima to the energy of the path with polygons with very small angles .",
    "the only way we got around this was to use first order accurate expressions for the derivatives and relatively large numbers of samples ( e.g.  48 points on each curve , 20 samples along the geodesic , hence @xmath812 variables in the expression for the energy .",
    "another problem is that the energy only depends on the path of unparametrized curves and is independent of the parametrization . to solve this",
    ", we added a term to the energy which is minimized by constant speed parametrizations .",
    "this still leaves a possibly wandering basepoint , and we added @xmath396 times another term which asked that all points on each curve should move as normally as possible . in practice , if the initialization was reasonable , this term was not needed .",
    "the final discrete energy that was minimized was this .",
    "let @xmath813 be the @xmath814 sample point on the @xmath815 curve @xmath816 . for each @xmath817 , estimate the sum of the squared curvature of @xmath816 plus the squared acceleration of the parametrization by : @xmath818 ( the harmonic mean of the segment lengths is used here to further force the parametrization to be uniform . ) then , for each @xmath817 , the _ four _ triangles @xmath819 around @xmath817 are considered and the energy is taken to be : @xmath820 we make no guarantees about the accuracy of this simulation !",
