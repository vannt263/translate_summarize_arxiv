    "the present paper is based on two different research areas which have been developed in the last years : _ conservative logic _ and _ many  valued logics_. conservative logic is a model of computation introduced by fredkin and toffoli in @xcite on the basis of the seminal paper of landauer  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) to improve the efficiency and performance of computing processes in terms of dissipated energy .",
    "the model is based on the _ fredkin gate _ , a universal boolean gate which is both conservative and reversible .    on the other hand ,",
    "many  valued logics are extensions of classical two  valued ( i.e. , boolean ) logic which have a great diffusion due to their ability to manage incomplete and/or uncertain knowledge .",
    "these two main subjects are briefly described in the next sections .    in this paper",
    "we propose an extension of conservative logic in order to include the main features of many  valued logics with a finite number of truth values . as a result",
    "we define some @xmath0valued universal gates which have the properties required by the conservative and many  valued paradigms .",
    "computational models are usually based upon boolean logic , and use some universal set of primitive connectives such as , for example , @xmath1 .    from a general point of view , a ( _ classical deterministic _ ) _ @xmath2inputs/@xmath3outputs gate _ ( where @xmath4 are positive integers ) is a special  purpose _ computer _ schematized as a device able to compute ( boolean ) _ logical functions _",
    "any @xmath6 ( resp . , @xmath7 ) is called an _ input _ ( resp . , _ output _ ) _ configuration_. for every @xmath8 ( resp . , @xmath9 ) , called the _ input _ ( resp . , _ output _ )",
    "_ bit _ of position @xmath10 ( resp . , @xmath11 ) , the boolean value @xmath12 ( resp . , @xmath13 )",
    "is said to be the _ state _ of bit @xmath10 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath11 ) with respect to configuration @xmath14 ( resp . , @xmath15 ) .",
    "finally , in the sequel we denote by @xmath16 the generic configuration belonging to the range of @xmath17 .    the action of the multi  output map @xmath17 on an input configuration @xmath14 produces the output configuration @xmath18 determined by the component _ logical truth functions _ ( single  output maps ) @xmath19 , for any @xmath20 , with a possible _ parallel _ implementation drawn in figure  [ fig : pdp-1 ] .",
    "_ conservative logic _ is a theoretical model of computation whose principal aim is to compute with zero _ internal power dissipation_. this goal is reached by basing the model upon _",
    "reversible _ and _ conservative primitives _ , which reflect physical principles such as the reversibility of microscopic dynamical laws and the conservation of certain _ physical quantities _ , such as the energy of the physical system used to perform the computations .",
    "* reversibility.*most of the times , computational models lack of _ reversibility _ ; that is , one can not in general deduce the input values of a gate from its output values .",
    "for example , knowing that the output of an and gate is the logical value @xmath21 one can not deduce the input values that generated it . the original motivation for the study of reversibility in classical computing came from the observation that heat dissipation is one of the major obstacles for miniaturization of classical computers and the fact that the second law of thermodynamics implies that irreversible state changes during computation must dissipate heat . `` thus , in the more abstract context of computing , the laws of `` conservation of information '' may play a role analogous to those of conservation of energy and momentum in physics . ''",
    "@xcite .",
    "lack of reversibility means that during the computation some information is lost . as shown by r.  landauer  @xcite",
    "( see also c.h .",
    "bennett @xcite which can be found in  @xcite ) , a loss of information implies a loss of energy and therefore any computational model based on irreversible primitives is necessarily _",
    "informationally dissipative_. this is nowadays known ( see @xcite ) as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * landauer s principle .",
    "* to erase a bit of classical information within a computer , @xmath22 bit of entropy must be expelled into the computer s environment , typically in the form of waste heat .",
    "thus logical irreversibility is associated with physical irreversibility and requires a minimal heat generation , per machine cycle , typically of the order of @xmath23 for each irreversible operation .",

    ". however , if computer hardware continues to shrink in size as so far , then the only feasible option to beat landauer s lower bound seems to be reversible computation . per logical operation .",
    "the heat must be removed by external means , for example , by constant cooling of all components by the thermal coupling of the circuits to a heat reservoir , i.e. , air . ]",
