    "x - ray novae are bright transients flared up on the sky for several months due to unsteady accretion of matter from a low mass companion onto a compact object .",
    "doppler spectroscopy of optical lines from such systems performed after their switching off in x - rays allowed their mass functions to be measured and indicates that the compact objects in these systems are black holes .",
    "the canonical x - ray novae have very soft black body spectra near their brightness maximum ( the reason to call them sometimes as soft x - ray transients ) and very hard ( extended to @xmath0 kev ) comptonized spectra at the short initial and long decaying phases of the outburst .",
    "it is obvious that the spectral evolution of x - ray novae should trace changes in regimes of disc accretion onto a black hole in these sources connected with changes in the accretion rate .",
    "this opportunity for studying the accretion regimes and the unique opportunity for finding new black holes and measuring their mass make x - ray novae very interesting targets for observers and astrophysicists .",
    "long term x - ray observations by ginga , mir / kvant , granat , cgro and rxte indicate that x - ray novae flare up approximately once a year that allowed us to believe that the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( integral ) @xcite with its wide fields of view of main telescopes , high sensitivity in the hard x - ray band and excellent capabilities for broad band spectroscopy will be able to detect and investigate many x - ray novae and provide us with new discoveries related to their peculiar x - ray properties .",
    "however , two years of the integral nominal operation have passed , more than one hundred of new hard x - ray sources have been discovered , several recurrent transients containing a black hole ( xtej1550 - 564 , 4u1630 - 472 , h1743 - 322/igrj17464 - 3213 , slx1746 - 331 , ) have flared up and been investigated but no one really new x - ray nova has been observed . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery with integral probably the first source of this type , igrj17098 - 3628 , describe its x - ray properties and some results from the follow - up observations .",
    "the new transient source igrj17098 - 3628 was discovered by @xcite with the ibis / isgri telescope @xcite on board integral on march 24.33 - 25.58 , 2005 ( ut ) , during deep open program observations of the galactic center field .",
    "the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio for the source in the mosaic image accumulated during this observation was @xmath1 in the 1845 kev band and @xmath2 in the 4570 kev band , the corresponding average fluxes were @xmath3 and @xmath4 mcrab .",
    "the source was variable on a time scale of hours reaching the maximum flux levels of 60 and 95 mcrab in these bands .",
    "the s / n mosaic map obtained in 1845 kev x - rays with isgri during this observation is presented in fig.[images]a .",
    "it shows that igrj17098 - 3628 was located in the close vicinity ( @xmath5  away ) of the other strongly variable integral source igrj17091 - 3624 @xcite .",
    "the position of igrj17098 - 3628 measured with isgri , @xmath60948 , @xmath72812  ( equinox 2000.0 , error radius 2 ) , kept it however well outside the error circle for the position of the second source ( @xmath60906 , @xmath82407 , error radius 0.8@xcite ) . to illustrate the capability of the telescope for distinguishing these sources we are giving in fig.[images]b the s /",
    "n map of the same region as in fig.[images]a but obtained with on february 16.23 - 18.66 , 2004 , when igrj17091 - 3624 was in the bright state .",
    "two next sets of our observations of the galactic center field ( on march 26.10 - 26.78 and 28.05 - 28.46 ut ) showed that igrj17098 - 3628 was strongly evolving in both brightness and spectral shape @xcite .",
    "the spectra measured on march 2425 and march 26 could be satisfactorily described by a simple power law in the broad 18200 kev band without any signs of a high energy cut - off .",
    "the photon index was equal to @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the spectrum measured on march 28 was significant only below 70 kev .",
    "its approximation with a power law led to the photon index @xmath11 .",
    "figure[lcurve ] gives light curves of the source in two energy bands , 1845 and 4570 kev , measured with isgri during this and several subsequent weeks of observations .",
    "data from the integral galactic bulge monitoring program ( partly presented in @xcite ) and several other open program observations ( currently public ) were added here to data of our deep view to the galactic center field .",
    "unfortunately there was a gap in the data between march 29 and april 2 because of calibration observations of the crab nebula performed with integral .",
    "the figure shows that the steady increase in the hard x - ray flux observed during the first days of the outburst stopped on march 26 when the level of @xmath12 mcrab has been reached .",
    "the flux began to decrease , slowly in the 1845 kev band and abruptly in the 4570 kev band , but then stabilized and was detectable at the level of 510 mcrab during at least two next weeks .",
    "the observed hard x - ray variability did not reflect changes in the rate of energy release in .",
    "a bulk of the total luminosity was emitted in the softer ( @xmath13 kev ) x - ray band .",
    "measurements with the monitor on board integral could be useful but the source was usually outside the narrow field of view of or at its very edge , in the region of low sensitivity .",
    "the rxte observatory carried out a cross - scanning of this field on march 29.179 - 29.227 ( ut ) and detected the source with the 320 kev flux of @xmath14 mcrab @xcite ( we thank the rxte team for organizing such a prompt observation ) .",
    "its best - fit position ( @xmath150938 , @xmath162741 , error radius 5 ) was generally consistent with that of isgri ( being only 21 away ) .    ]    the broad - band spectrum @xmath17 of igrj17098 - 3628 measured with rxte / pca ( on march 29 ) and ibis / isgri ( on march 28 ) is shown in fig.[spec ] by open points .",
    "the spectrum is complex consisting of a soft black body component ( we approximated it with the diskbb model of xspec ) and a hard tail ( approximated with the cutoffpl model of xspec ) .",
    "the inner temperature and radius of the disk were @xmath18 kev and @xmath19 km , the photon index and cut - off energy of the hard tail were @xmath20 and @xmath21 kev . here",

    "the luminosity was @xmath31 and @xmath32 erg s@xmath29 in the 320 and 20200 kev bands .",
    "note that the hard component contributed significantly @xmath33% to the 320 kev luminosity .",
    "the luminosity of the diskbb component @xmath34 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "later rxte carried our several pointed observations of the source ( with a @xmath35  offset to discriminate possible contributions from igrj17091 - 3624 ) .",
    "the spectrum measured on april 4 with pca and isgri is shown in fig.[spec ] by filled points .",
    "the best - fit parameters were @xmath36 kev , @xmath37 km , @xmath38 and @xmath39 kev , @xmath40 .",
    "the flux in the iron line was consistent with that measured on march 29 confirming its interstellar ( galactic ) origin .",
    "the luminosity was @xmath41 ( 320 kev ) and @xmath42 erg s@xmath29 ( 20200 kev ) , @xmath43 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "to allow identification of igr j17098 - 3628 in soft x - ray , optical and radio bands we initiated its too observation with the swift / xrt telescope .",
    "the observation was carried out on may 1.68 - 1.76 , 2005 ( ut ) with an exposure time of 2.8 ks .",
    "the analysis @xcite of these data has revealed a bright x - ray source with the coordinates @xmath4409459 , @xmath162757  and the error radius of about 5  ( 90% containment ) .",
    "this position is 30  from the integral position . the source s average 0.510 kev flux corresponded to the luminosity @xmath45 erg s@xmath29 ( non - corrected for absorption ) .",
    "the flux dropped by @xmath46% during the observation .",
    "following the swift / xrt localization the possible optical / ir counterparts for igrj17098 - 3628 , associated with 2massj17094612 - 3627573 , have been proposed @xcite and nominally confirmed by new observations from the 6.5-m magellan - baade telescope @xcite and swift / uvot @xcite . however , because of the low galactic latitude of igrj17098 - 3628 ( see fig.[images ] ) , the stellar density in this field is high and the chance of finding a non - related star even within the narrow xrt error box was considerable . the long term vla observations @xcite have shown that 2massj17094612 - 3627573 did not relate to the x - ray source .",
    "these observations were carried out on march 31 , april 5 , april 12 , and may 4 , all at 4.86 ghz . the first data set showed the only significant radio source within the 2  integral error circle , located at @xmath470945@xmath48011 , @xmath492757@xmath5055 .",
    "its flux density on march 31 was @xmath51 mjy .",
    "the later observations gave nominal flux densities of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 mjy / beam ; only the last was a detection .",
    "the radio transient lies 05 from the swift / xrt position and 28 from that of 2mass j17094612 - 3627573 .",
    "its fading from march 31 to april 5 , and possible re - appearance around may 4 , are consistent with the x - ray evolution @xcite and indicate that this is indeed the radio counterpart to the x - ray transient .",
    "@xcite re - investigated their magellan - baade i - band images obtained on april 9 , 2005 @xcite and found ( see fig.[image_opt ] ) a point source located at @xmath15094593 , @xmath5527582 ( 02 uncertainty ) .",
    "this optical position is consistent within 2-@xmath56 error with that derived from the radio observations .",
    "the additional i - band images taken with the telescope on may 13.38813.394 , 2005 ( ut ) indicated that the optical source has faded by 0@xmath5702 since april  9 .",
    "the positional coincidence with the swift and vla detections and the photometric variability suggest that this source is indeed the optical counterpart to igrj17098 - 3628 .",

    "the observed behaviour of igr j17098 - 3628 suggests that it was an x - ray nova at an initial stage of the outburst and thus  a new black hole candidate .",

    "the temperature @xmath58 kev of the soft spectral component of igrj17098 - 3628 was much smaller than that typical of lmxbs containing neutron stars .",
