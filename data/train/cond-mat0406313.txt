    "the microwave response of superconductors is of great interest in several temperature and magnetic field ranges , since it carries information about both macroscopic and microscopic quantities , such as resistivity or electromagnetic penetration depth .",
    "most of available experimental data are restricted to fixed frequencies ( resonant cavity techniques ) , whereas a study over a continuous frequency spectrum would allow for a deeper investigation of the dynamical behaviour of the system . an experimental technique which makes it possible to evaluate",
    "the complex surface impedance @xmath1 of a superconducting film as a function of frequency has been proposed in the past by some groups @xcite .",
    "the technique is based on the measurement of the reflection coefficients at the input of a coaxial line terminated by the film ( corbino disk ) .    extracting the contribution of the sample from the measured data",
    "is a critical step during data analysis : the contribution of the coaxial line , in fact , is in general comparable with that of the sample .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present the most recent results on this experimental procedure , as obtained in our laboratory .",
    "temperature is varied employing a helium flow cryostat and magnetic field is generated by a superconducting coil ( maximum attainable field : 16 t ) .",
    "the electromagnetic field is generated and analysed by a vector network analizer ( vna ) , connected to the sample by a commercial coaxial cable ( cutoff frequency : 60 ghz ) , about 3.5 meters long ( 1 meter inside the cryostat and 2.5 meters outside ) .",
    "such a large distance is needed in order to keep the vna as far as possible from the magnet . on the other hand",
    "such a high length results in a heavy attenuation of the signal , especially at higher frequencies , which prevented us to perform measurements above 35 ghz and resulted in highly noisy measurements above 20 ghz .",
    "the sample surface impedance is probed as a function of frequency through a corbino disk geometry , in which the sample shortcircuits the above mentioned cable .",
    "the connection between the cable and the sample is realised through a double spring method , extensively described in @xcite . with respect to previous realisations",
    ", a thin indium ring has been placed between the sample and the outer connector of the cable , to reduce the possible damage of the sample .",
    "however this was not sufficient to suppress a detectable contact capacitance .",
    "the capacitance effect results to be smaller for the mgb@xmath0 film than for the ybco film , suggesting that the sample surface plays a relevant role in the overall contact realisation . as a result of this spurious capacitance ,",
    "data on ybco are not reliable below 6 ghz , while in the case of mgb@xmath0 the capacitance masks data only below @xmath2 ghz , so that the actual frequency range over which measurements will be presented in the following of the paper is limited to @xmath3 ghz for ybco and @xmath4 ghz for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "the samples here considered are a thin ( @xmath5  ) , square ( l = 10 mm ) ybco film , grown by planar high oxygen pressure dc sputtering on a laalo@xmath6 substrate @xcite , and a thin ( @xmath7  ) , square ( l = 5 mm ) mgb@xmath0 film , grown by pulsed laser deposition with a conventional two step technique on a sapphire substrate @xcite .",
    "the measured quantity is , for any magnetic field @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9 , the reflection coefficient @xmath10 , measured at the vna location .",
    "two kinds of measurements can be made during a measuring session : the collection of a set of curves @xmath11 at fixed magnetic field and different temperatures , to which we will refer in the following as `` transitions '' , or the collection of a set of curves @xmath12 at different magnetic fields and fixed temperature , which will be called `` field sweeps '' .",
    "the dependencies on @xmath13 will be often omitted in the following for the sake of compactness .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the problem issued in this paper is how to extract the surface impedance @xmath14 of the sample from the reflection coefficients @xmath15 measured at the beginning of the coaxial cable .",
    "@xmath14 is defined as the ratio between transverse electric and magnetic field components at the sample surface .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate @xcite that @xmath14 is related to the reflection coefficient at the sample surface @xmath16 through the relation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the characteristic impedance of the dielectric filling the cable .",
    "we estimate @xmath19 ( vacuum impedance ) being the last section of the cable not filled with the dielectric .    in principle",
    ", the values of @xmath16 can be extracted from the measured reflection coefficient at the vna input @xmath15 through the standard relation @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are complex error coefficients taking into account distortions of the signal due to the transmission through the cable .",
    "they depend on frequency and on the temperature profile of the whole cable but we want to stress since now that , since the cable is constructed with non magnetic materials , the error coefficients do not depend on magnetic field .",
    "these three parameters are customarily determined by measuring the response of three known loads replacing the sample ( line calibration ) but in our case the experimental setup does not allow for a full calibration of the cable since the corbino cell is inaccessible during measuring sessions and calibration standards at the temperatures of interest in this work are not available .",
    "nevertheless extraction of useful information from the experimental data is possible through the following two step procedure .",
    "daily calibration of the section of the cable external to the cryostat was performed , hence from here on we will no further consider it , as if the vna were directly connected to the internal , one - meter long , cable .",
    "this means that the cable and reflection coefficients dealt with in the following are only relative to the internal cable .    before the beginning of the experiment we measured and stored the error coefficients @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the internal cable at room temperature @xmath25 .",
    "we then define @xmath26 as : @xmath27 as can be seen by inverting equation [ gammam ] with respect to @xmath16 , @xmath24 is @xmath16 when measured at @xmath28 and at all the other temperatures if the error coefficients were temperature independent . a relation between @xmath26 and @xmath29 at @xmath30 ,",
    "can be found if we put @xmath31 as obtained from equation [ gammam ] into equation [ gammamtilde ] : @xmath32}\\ ] ] we expect cable coefficients not to change by more than 10% for any variation of the temperature profile in the cable .",
    "moreover , during the room temperature calibrations , we found @xmath33 and @xmath34 to be quite generally no more than 10% of @xmath35 , which is instead of the same order of @xmath36 .",
    "this means that @xmath37 and we can neglect it in equation [ gamma0prima ] , obtaining after some algebra @xmath38}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 .",
    "again @xmath40 and @xmath41 so that one gets , to within a few percent of precision , @xmath42 we stress that the coefficient @xmath43 , defined through equation [ gamma0finale ] , depends in a non - trivial way upon the whole temperature profile of the cable so that no practical measurement of it is possible . nevertheless , when performing measurements at low t ( @xmath44k ) , it is reasonable to expect that it is almost constant when varying the temperature of the sample of a few tens of kelvin ; the cable , in fact , is thermally constrained at room temperature at the entrance of the cryostat , so that the temperature profile of the cable only slightly changes for such variations of the temperature of the sample @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , though @xmath24 is essentially different from @xmath45 , the ratios of @xmath24 are good approximations of the ratios of the corresponding @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth to note that equation [ gamma0finale ] is a relation between complex quantities , implying the following couple of real equations : @xmath46 & = &   arg[\\gamma_{0}(\\nu;t)]+arg[\\alpha(\\nu;t ) ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] as we will see , while @xmath47 is reasonably constant over small variations of temperature , the same does not hold generally for @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "this poses some limit to the knowledge of @xmath49 $ ] , the consequences of which will be discussed in the following .      in this paragraph",
    "we will demonstrate how the ratio of two @xmath45 determined at two different temperatures or magnetic fields is related to the corresponding difference of impedances .",
    "some approximations are needed which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "we first consider only temperature variations and then we will extend our conclusions to the case of varying magnetic field .    let s consider the difference between two curves of @xmath50 at two different values of the temperature , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 . making use of equation [ zs ] ,",
    "we can write @xmath53 the approximation involved in the last equivalence will be extensively discussed in the following , but we stress since now that it is surely possible if @xmath54 . within this limit",
    "we then found that the difference between two values of the impedance at different temperature is a function only of the ratio of the respective reflection coefficients at the sample surface .",
    "we can separate the above equation in its real and imaginary part , in order to work with real rather than complex quantities .",
    "writing as usual @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 } \\label{rsprima}\\ ] ] @xmath57}{1+|\\frac{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu;t_{1})}{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu;t_{2})}|^{2}+2re[\\frac{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu;t_{1})}{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu;t_{2 } ) } ] } \\label{xsprima}\\ ] ] now we come to the last approximation .",
    "we define @xmath58-arg[\\gamma_{0}(\\nu;t_{2})]$ ] as the phase variation between the two reflection coefficients ; if @xmath59 is small ( for each frequency @xmath60 of interest ) then the approximations @xmath61 and @xmath62 hold . in this",
    "case equations [ rsprima ] and [ xsprima ] can be approximated as @xmath63 @xmath64 where we stress that equation [ rs0 ] depends only on the ratio of the moduli of the reflection coefficients and not upon the phase variations . in this way",
    "the determination of @xmath65 requires information about @xmath66 only , while @xmath67 can be obtained only through the knowledge of both @xmath66 and @xmath68 .",
    "putting the results of equation [ gamma0finale ] into these formulae we get @xmath69 @xmath70 if we have @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 , equation [ rs0 ] can be finally rewritten as @xmath73 if we also have @xmath74 , so that @xmath75 , then equation [ xs0 ] can be approximated with @xmath76 formulae [ rsfinale ] and [ xsfinale ] are the main result of this paper .",
    "they relate the variation of impedance between two different temperatures to the measured quantities . through these formulae , in fact , once a temperature @xmath77 at which @xmath78 is fixed , the differences @xmath79 for each temperature @xmath9 can be obtained .",
    "moreover , once all the @xmath80 are known , if a temperature @xmath81 exists for which the curve @xmath82 is theoretically predictable or experimentally known , absolute values of @xmath83 can be extracted .",
    "the procedure can be easily extended to the case of measurements as a function of the applied magnetic field at a fixed temperature @xmath84 ( field sweeps ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath85 and the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are obtained with the same expressions as in equations [ rsfinale ] and [ xsfinale ] by replacing the temperature dependence with the magnetic field dependence . with respect to measurements as a function of temperature",
    ", there is the advantage that the response of the cable is not expected to vary by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "this implies that the coefficient @xmath88 remains constant among measurements at different magnetic fields , provided that the whole cable has reached its equilibrium temperature profile .",
    "the result is that the condition @xmath89 needed to obtain equations [ rsfinale ] and [ xsfinale ] from [ rsm ] and [ xsm ] is exactly , instead of approximately , satisfied .      in this paragraph",
    "we discuss the validity of the approximations introduced in the previous section to come to equations [ rsfinale ] and [ xsfinale ] .",
    "two of these approximations deal with hypotheses on @xmath90 ( markedly , that it exists a pair of values \\{h , t } for which @xmath91 and that the variation of @xmath92 $ ] as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath8 are small ) while the other two approximations deal with the variation as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath8 of the complex parameter @xmath93 relating @xmath90 with @xmath94 .",
    "this task will be accomplished by putting together information that can be obtained from dc and microwave measurements , as well as from theoretical predictions .    as a first step",
    ", we notice that from the resistivity value obtained from dc measurements ( see figure [ dc+gamma ] ) we can infer that the thin film approximation @xcite is valid just above the transition temperature . we will then assume that for all temperatures one may write @xmath95 .",
    "we then focus on the assumptions related to @xmath90 .",
    "the first assumption is certainly verified at low enough temperatures and zero applied magnetic field , since both @xmath96 and @xmath97 are expected to become much smaller than @xmath18 for @xmath98 , so that @xmath99 .",
    "we will come later on the criteria used to choose the value of @xmath77 , and to the choice of @xmath100 and @xmath77 for the measurements as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the second approximation can be verified by measuring the temperature variations of the phase of the measured @xmath94 . in figure",
    "[ phase ] we report the behaviour of @xmath101 $ ] as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath102 t and @xmath103 ghz .",
    "the overall behaviour is composed by a rather sharp peak , located in a @xmath9 range just below @xmath104 , over a smoothly @xmath9 dependent background . since the phase of @xmath90 is expected to be constant , as a function of @xmath9 , both above @xmath104 ( where @xmath105 and thus @xmath90 are real ) and sufficiently below @xmath104 ( where , as discussed above , @xmath92\\simeq \\pi$ ] ) , it is natural to ascribe the smooth background to variations of @xmath106 $ ] and the peak to variations of @xmath90 .",
    "the peak of @xmath92 $ ] can be easily understood on general grounds : in fact , @xmath92\\neq 0 $ ] only if @xmath97 is comparable with @xmath18 , which is true only at temperatures slightly below @xmath104 .",
    "similar results are obtained also when it is present an applied magnetic field . from the measured values",
    ", one gets @xmath107 rad , so that the approximation @xmath108 is reasonably fulfilled for all temperatures and fields .",
    "we now come to the approximations dealing with the variations of @xmath93 , starting with the approximation @xmath109 .",
    "in figure [ dc+gamma ] we plot the measured dc resistivity of the mgb@xmath0 sample , together with the measured @xmath110 at 17.5 ghz .",
    "since @xmath111 is expected to be real and independent on frequency above @xmath104 , one has @xmath105 real in this temperature range , resulting in @xmath90 being real and independent on frequency .",
    "further , since @xmath112 is almost independent on @xmath9 for @xmath113k@xmath114k , we may conclude that @xmath90 is also almost independent on @xmath9 just above @xmath104 .",
    "the measured @xmath110 is approximately constant , as a function of temperature , between @xmath115 k and @xmath113 k , as well as below @xmath116 k. this is consistent with the above discussion : above @xmath104 , one has @xmath90 almost independent on @xmath9 , and sufficiently below @xmath104 one has @xmath117 , again independent on @xmath9 . the small variation as a function of @xmath9 can then be ascribed to variations of @xmath47 with @xmath9 , which turn out to be much smaller than the variations of @xmath66 , as required .",
    "it is worth to stress that at high frequency one has @xmath118 only for @xmath98 , so that it is not surprising that the condition @xmath119 is reached only for @xmath120k . as noticed before , this fact , together with the validity of the assumptions on @xmath90 previously verified , guarantees that it is possible to obtain the values of @xmath96 from the measured @xmath121 .",
    "the last approximation to be verified is the one related to variations of @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "it is evident from figure [ phase ] that the peak of @xmath92 $ ] is of the same order of magnitude as the variations of the smooth background .",
    "this means that the condition @xmath74 does not hold and we can not make use of equation [ xsfinale ] to get sample reactance from measurements as a function of temperature . as noticed before , this limitation is intrinsically eliminated when performing measurements at fixed temperature as a function of the applied magnetic field ( field sweeps ) , that allow for a determination of both the real and the imaginary part of @xmath80 .",
    "once the validity of the approximations has been discussed , we turn to the description of the practical method employed for the determination of the impedance . this purpose is pursued through extensive use of equations [ rsfinale ] and [ xsfinale ] .",
    "we start with the zero field case .",
    "first of all it is necessary to choose the reference temperature @xmath77 with respect to which we calculate the variation of the impedance .",
    "this choice is dictated by the necessity to satisfy the approximation involved in equation [ deltagamma0 ] . as we saw in the previous paragraph",
    "this approximation is surely valid for the zero field transition when the choice @xmath122 is made .",
    "operatively the condition @xmath123 is considered to be reached when the curves @xmath124 approach a constant value as a function of temperature ( in figure [ dc+gamma ] , for example , below 13 k ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath77 is then chosen as low as possible considering that we need at the same time @xmath125 in the temperature interval @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "we then choose @xmath127 k for mgb@xmath128 and @xmath129 k for ybco @xcite .",
    "once we have all the differences @xmath130 we can obtain the absolute values @xmath131 if one of the curves @xmath132 is known . again , as we discussed in the previous paragraph , at @xmath123 @xmath133 so that in this case the extraction of the absolute values is trivial because , with the choice of @xmath122 , @xmath134 .    for whet concerns the field sweeps measurements we chose @xmath135 for all sweeps",
    ". in this case ,",
    "when the temperature @xmath136 at which the field sweep is performed is close to @xmath137 , the condition @xmath138 is not fully satisfied . nevertheless , by using the values of @xmath131 obtained from the zero field transition , we can estimate in no more than 5% the error made with the approximation contained in equation [ deltagamma0 ] .",
    "absolute values of @xmath139 can again be extracted for field sweeps measurements using the curve @xmath140 obtained from the zero field transition . since , by choosing @xmath135 , all the curves @xmath65 are variations with respect to @xmath102 , we add to all the curves of the field sweep the curve @xmath141 , obtained from the zero field transition . in this way we transform the set of curves",
    "@xmath142 into a set of curves @xmath143 .",
    "to obtain absolute values of @xmath144 we can not make use of the zero field transition because we recall that @xmath144 can not be extracted from transitions .",
    "however we can exploit the fact that above the upper critical field , where the system is in the normal state , @xmath97 is expected to vanish .",
    "then , by subtracting to each curve @xmath145 the value of @xmath146 , with @xmath147 , one gets the absolute values of @xmath148 . in order to check for which values of @xmath8 the condition",
    "@xmath149 is satisfied , we analyse the curves @xmath145 in a similar way as was done to determine @xmath77 in the zero field transition : it can be noticed , in fact , that @xmath145 approaches a constant value at high magnetic fields , so that we choose @xmath150 among the fields at which @xmath151 .",
    "this latter procedure is possible only if the observed @xmath145 reaches a constant value at high fields , that is if the applied magnetic field reaches a value above the upper critical field .",
    "this can easily be obtained mgb@xmath0 , whose upper critical field is around 10 t even at low temperature , while it is not possible for ybco , whose upper critical field exceeds our experimental limits a few kelvin below @xmath104 .",
    "the results will then be presented as @xmath152 and @xmath153 for mgb@xmath0 , while for ybco we can report only @xmath152 and @xmath154 .",
    "in the following , we report some examples of the measuring procedure for both mgb@xmath0 and ybco . we first present the results of the measurement at zero magnetic field as a function of temperature . in fig .",
    "[ r1(t)_mgb2 ] we report the real part of @xmath155 in mgb@xmath0 at different frequencies . the transition widens with increasing frequency . to have a more quantitative description of the widening",
    ", one can define @xmath156 as the temperature where the resistivity , at the given frequency @xmath157 , reaches one half of the value in the normal state , and @xmath158 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath159 , normalised to the value of @xmath104 at @xmath160 ghz is reported in fig .",
    "[ delta_tc ] ( filled circles ) .",
    "the same analysis is presented in fig.[r1(t)_ybco ] , for ybco where curves of @xmath161k ) are presented as a function of @xmath9 at various frequencies .",
    "the real part of the resistivity remains almost zero up to @xmath162k , then grows at @xmath104 rapidly reaching the normal state value . as in the case of mgb@xmath0 , the transition widens as the frequency is increased .",
    "however , the widening is relatively small compared to mgb@xmath0 and the upper part of the transition is almost unaffected by the variation of the frequency , being only the very last part of it severely dependent on frequency .",
    "the values of @xmath163 ( with @xmath164 ghz ) are reported in fig .",
    "[ delta_tc ] for a quantitative comparison with the values obtained for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we now come to the results as a function of magnetic field , at fixed frequency .",
    "again , we first present results on mgb@xmath0 . in figure [ mgb2_7.5k ]",
    "we report measurements of @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( where @xmath167 is the resistivity at the highest field ) at 7.5 k and different frequencies , as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "both @xmath96 ( upper panel ) and @xmath97 ( lower panel ) do not show appreciable variations as a function of field above @xmath168 t , indicating that the upper critical field is reasonably below that value .",
    "the assumption that at 13 t the material is in its normal state , so that @xmath169t@xmath170 and @xmath171t@xmath172 is then fully justified . finally , we present in figure [ ybco - ramp ] the real part of the resistivity in ybco at @xmath173 k , at various frequencies and as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "we collected reflection coefficient measurements of superconducting thin films as a function of frequency through a corbino disk technique .",
    "we developed a measurement technique by which it is possible to obtain the impedance from the reflection coefficients once that some conditions are verified .",
    "we extensively discuss these conditions and how we can conclude which of them are verified .",
    "the relative curves at fixed frequencies are shown , together with a brief discussion of the data .                  we can also roughly estimate the frequency dependence of @xmath175 considering that it is the ratio between two transmission coefficients at different temperatures .",
    "since @xmath176 takes into account the attenuation of the field due to losses through the dielectric and on the cable conductors , it decreases with increasing frequency and temperature .",
    "we can then expect that , if @xmath30 , @xmath177 and it will increase with frequency .",
    "this is exactly the behaviour measured , as can be seen in figure [ gmtilde(nu ) ] .",
    "since the condition @xmath178 is more and more satisfied as @xmath98 , one might be tempted to use @xmath179 k for both ybco and mgb@xmath0 . however , an important requirement is that @xmath93 be constant over the whole @xmath9 range between @xmath77 and the temperature @xmath9 of interest .",
    "it is the necessary to limit the overall temperature range explored , in order to minimise the effects of temperature variations of @xmath93 ."
