    "precise knowledge of the gluon distribution at small @xmath2 is critical for reliable predictions of hard processes in hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus , and nucleus - nucleus collisions at collider energies .",
    "although tremendous effort has been invested in the study of the gluon distribution of a free hadron , there are still large uncertainties in the distribution in both the large and small @xmath2 regions @xcite .",

    "thus , information on the gluon distribution in a nucleus is far from complete @xcite . with better data from collider facilities , like the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and also from the tevatron at fermilab",

    ", we demonstrate that the rapidity distribution of low - mass drell - yan pairs at large - enough transverse momentum is an advantageous source of constraints on the gluon distribution and its nuclear dependence",
    ".    a good process from the point of view of probing the gluon distribution must satisfy the following criteria : ( i ) it has to be reliably calculable within the factorization frame work of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) ; ( ii ) its production cross section must be dominated by gluon - initiated sub - processes ; and ( iii ) it should have sufficient production rate for the process to be observed . for probing the gluon distribution in a nucleus ,",
    "we need to add another criterion : ( iv ) the process should have relatively small initial- and final - state medium effects because of the twist-2 nature of the gluon distribution .",
    "it was first pointed out by berger et al .",
    "@xcite that the transverse - momentum distribution of drell - yan ( massive ) lepton pairs produced in hadronic collision is an advantageous source of constraints on the gluon distribution because of the dominance of gluon initiated subprocesses .",
    "these authors also emphasized that this process is free from the complications of photon isolation that beset studies of prompt photon production@xcite . due to the `` drell - yan factor '' in the cross section ( the first factor on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "the large suppression due to isospin effects , which reaches @xmath147% at high transverse momentum is also from the `` yellow '' beam side , where the larger @xmath62 gives a stronger @xmath148 asymmetry . to demonstrate this point",

    "the drell - yan pair production is suppressed more in the forward region , as expected .",
    "however , it is surprising that in @xmath8 collisions , the drell - yan pair production in the forward region is actually slightly less suppressed than in the central rapidity region , up to @xmath152 13  gev .",

    "the shadowing factors are almost constant in @xmath156 $ ] . however ,",
    "shadowing effects decrease much in the region @xmath157 $ ] .",

    "in summary , low - mass drell - yan dilepton production is a potentially clean probe of small-@xmath2 gluons , without strong final - state interactions . when @xmath158 gev , the gluon initiated sub - processes contribute more than 80% to the cross section .",
    "unfortunately , low - mass drell - yan dilepton production suffers from low production rate at rhic due to the drell - yan factor . at the tevatron and lhc energies ,",
    "high-@xmath0 low - mass drell - yan production is an excellent probe of the gluon distributions .",
    "we have shown that the production rate for low - mass drell - yan pairs at tevatron and lhc energies does not reduce for a wide range of rapidity , and the forward region is very sensitive to small-@xmath2 gluons .",
    "therefore , the rapidity distribution of low - mass drell - yan pairs at large enough transverse momentum could be a good and clean probe of small-@xmath2 gluons at collider energies .",
    "because of the lack of final - state interactions and the relatively weak initial - state nuclear - dependent power corrections at high @xmath0 , the rapidity and transverse momentum distribution of low - mass drell - yan pairs in hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions should be a very good probe of the gluon distribution in a nucleus . by comparing the nuclear modification factor of @xmath159 and @xmath5 , we demonstrated quantitatively that the isospin effect is very important in extracting nuclear parton distributions .",
    "we have shown that low - mass drell - yan pairs in the forward region at tevatron and lhc energies provide very sensitive information on the gluon distribution and its nuclear dependence for @xmath2 less than 10@xmath160 . with such sensitivity on gluons ,",
    "low mass drell - yan dilepton can be a good probe of the novel phenomena of gluon saturation or color glass condensate in a large nucleus .",
    "we believe that in view of the importance of small-@xmath2 gluons , the ability of low - mass drell - yan pairs to provide information on these gluon distributions as demonstrated in the present paper warrants the mounting of experimental efforts to measure low - mass drell - yan pairs at colliders .",
