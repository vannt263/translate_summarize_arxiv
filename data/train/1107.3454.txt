    "2010 ; smith et al . 2011 ; wesson et al . 2009 ) . in our presentations at the _ intermediate - luminosity red transients _ meeting we argued that the total energy of these transients hints on the basic energy source ( ` engine ' ) powering their eruptions .",
    "we term these outbursts intermediate - luminosity optical transients ( ilots ; other terms in use are intermediate - luminosity red transients and red novae ) .    in this summary of our presentations",
    "we show that in the same way as the total energy of sne and novae can be explained from fundamental quantities , so is the case for ilots . for that we summarize in short the expressions for sne and novae energies , and then turn to discuss ilots .",
    "we propose that ilots are powered by accreting mass from a companion onto a main - sequence ( ms ) star .",
    "the companion can either survive the mass transfer process , or merge with the primary in a process termed mergerburst .",
    "one way to present the different objects is the energy - time diagram ( etd ; at the workshop , m. kasliwal and s. kulkarni presented the classification of ilots on the luminosity - time diagram ; see kulkarni et al .",
    "the etd ( figure [ fig : totevst ] ) presents the _ total energy _ of the transients , radiated plus kinetic , as a function of the duration of their eruption , defined as a drop of @xmath3 magnitudes in the v - band .",
    "however , as the goal is eventually to understand the physical processes of the eruptions , when a model for an event exists , or when there is more information from observations , we calculate the _ available energy _ ,",
    "i.e. , total gravitational energy available for the event .",
    "namely , the gravitational energy that could have been released if all the mass is accreted by the accreting star .",
    "the upper - right region of the ots is occupied by major lbv eruptions , while the lower - left region is occupied by ilots .",
    "the lower most part of the ots is predicted to be occupied by mergerbursts between a planet and a brown dwarf ( bd ) ( bear et al .",
    "2011 ) . in this process",
    "the planet is shredded into a disk , and the accretion lead to an outburst .",
    "the destruction of a component in a binary system and transforming it to an accretion disk is an extreme case of mass transfer processes in binary systems .    for major lbv eruptions",
    "the available energy is equal to the radiated plus kinetic energy , as there is no inflated envelope .",
    "we estimate the available energy for some ilots .",
    "however , as stated , for most ilots the observations and models are not yet detailed enough to perform this estimate , and we can only present the estimated radiated plus kinetic energy .",
    "the available energy of @xmath4 ( including neutrinos ) in the explosion of core - collapse ( cc ) sne can be understood from fundamental quantities .",
    "the energy is the binding energy of a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "the mass of the neutron star is about the chandrasekhar mass that is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the neutron mass .",
    "the ns radius is given from basic relation of the pressure of degenerate neutron gas @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the total available energy is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a function of the fundamental parameters .",
    "( the numerical values are given up to a factor of @xmath10 , as we are not interested in the exact values , but only in orders of magnitude . )    the total explosion energy ( kinetic + radiation ) of cc sne is about the binding energy of the star , which is basically the binding energy of the core .",
    "this is about equal to the binding energy of a white dwarf ( wd ) , which is also the total explosion energy of sne ia .",
    "the relevant mass is the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the expression for the typical radius of a wd , or of the core of a cc sn , includes the mass of the electron @xmath11 as well as the other fundamental quantities @xmath12 the total energy of cc and type ia sne is therefore @xmath13",
    "the energy released by novae can also be understood from fundamental quantities , although with a larger scatter than the expressions relevant to sne .",
    "a hydrogen rich gas is accumulated onto a wd , and is ignited when the temperature at the base of the accreted layer reaches the hydrogen nuclear ignition temperature of @xmath14 .",
    "we demand that the gas at the base of the accreted layer is degenerate at this temperature .",
    "the constraint on the density of the degenerate electron gas comes from quantum mechanics and reads @xmath15 and gives @xmath16 . at this density",
    "the thermal pressure is about equal to the pressure due to degenerate electrons gas .",
    "equating the hydrostatic pressure of the accreted layer to the gas pressure at temperature @xmath17 and density @xmath18 gives the mass of the accreted layer .",
    "this can be cast into the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average density of the wd , and @xmath21 is the virial temperature of the wd .",
    "we have @xmath22 and @xmath23 , from which we derive @xmath24 .",
    "the efficiency of hydrogen burning is several percents , accounting for novae typical total energy of @xmath25@xmath26 .",
    "we here argue that the typical available energy of ilots can also be accounted for by fundamental quantities . the available energy in these events ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is @xmath27@xmath1 .",
    "we show that this energy , despite the wide range , is a typical binding energy of main - sequence ( ms ) stars and envelopes of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and red giant branch ( rgb ) stars .",
    "the requirement that hydrogen burns in the core of ms stars set their virial temperature at @xmath28 . in turn , this determines the gravitational potential on the stellar surface @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mean mass per particle",
    ". the potential can be @xmath31 times as high for massive stars , as the secondary star in @xmath32 carinae , and 3 times lower for brown dwarfs .",
    "the amount of mass accreted in our model ( kashi et al . 2010 ; kashi & soker 2011 ; bear et al .",
    "2011 ) might vary a lot : it can be @xmath33  several@xmath34 in the case of the great eruption of @xmath32 carinae ( gomez et al .",
    "2006 , 2009 ; smith et al . 2003 ; smith & ferland 2007 ; smith & owocki 2006 ) , and down to @xmath35 in a case where a planet is destructed on the surface of a brown dwarf ( bear et al .",
    "this gives the large variation in the energy .",
    "however , the gross typical mass is that of a ms star , which is about the solar mass . this mass is also determined from fundamental parameters : the upper limit is set by demanding that radiation pressure does not destroy the star , while the lower mass is determined by the brown dwarf limit where degenerate material prevents the contraction and heating - up the core .",
    "therefore , the typical mass that a companion can transfer to a ms companion , either through merger or mass transfer from a red giant is @xmath36 .",
    "the available energy is @xmath37 this , we suggest , explains most of the events populating the the optical transient stripe ( ots ) between novae and sne .",
    "the total energy might be less than the available energy , as some of the energy goes to uplift envelope mass , rather than to the kinetic energy of the ejected mass and to radiation .",
    "interestingly , the binding energy of the envelopes of massive agb stars ( extreme agb ) , those with masses of @xmath38@xmath39 , is @xmath40 .",
    "this might raise the possibility that events related to the envelopes , such as major instability of the envelope or ejection of the envelope , might be also located in that region .",
    "for example , the ejection of the envelope of an agb star of @xmath41 requires energy of @xmath40 .",
    "if this is done via a common envelope phase , it can be an explosive event with the break out of a shock wave ( kashi & soker 2011 ) , and the release of this typical amount of anergy .",
    "the ` engine ' that supplies the energy is the gravitational energy of the core and a companion that end at an orbital separation of @xmath42 , bringing us back to an equation similar to equation ( [ eq - ms2 ] ) .",
    "the shock break - out in this case might not have the power that is required in the scenario of kochanek ( 2011 ) for dust destruction .",
    "however , an accreting companion might supply the required ionizing radiation that can destroy the dust in systems like ngc  300ot ( bond et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the time scales of sne , novae , and ilots are determines by different processes . for ilots , it is basically the mass transfer time scale . here",
    "we set a lower limit on this time scale .",
    "the average total gravitational power is the average accretion rate times the potential well of the accreting star @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mass and radius of the accretor , and @xmath46 is the mass accretion rate . in the binary model discussed here ,",
    "accreted mass is likely to form an accretion disk or an accretion belt .",
    "the accretion time must be longer than the viscosity time scale for the accreted mass to lose its angular momentum . according to dubus et al .",
    "( 2001 ) the viscous timescale is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the viscosity of the disk , @xmath49 is the thickness of the disk , @xmath50 is the sound speed and @xmath51 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "we scale @xmath44 and @xmath45 in equation ( [ eq : tvisc1 ] ) according to the parameters of v838  mon ( tylenda 2005 ) . for these parameters",
    "the viscous to keplerian times ratio is @xmath52 .",
    "the accreted mass is determined by the details of the binary interaction process , and differs from object to object .",
    "we scale it by @xmath53 . based on the modelled systems ( v  1309  sco , tylenda et al .",
    "2011 ; v838  mon ; @xmath32 car ) this mass fraction is @xmath54 with a large variation . the value of @xmath54 can be understood as follows . if the ms ( or slightly off - ms ) star collides with a star and tidally disrupts it , as in the model for v838  mon ( soker & tylenda 2003 ; tylenda & soker 2006 ) , the destructed star is likely to be of much lower mass than the accretor @xmath55 .",
    "another possibility is that an evolved star loses a huge amount of mass . in that case",
    "it is possible that the accretor will gain only a small fraction of the ejected mass , as in the scenario for the great eruption of @xmath32 carinae ( kashi & soker 2010 ) . here",
    "again we expect @xmath56 .",
    "the viscous time scale gives an upper limit on the accretion rate @xmath57 the maximum gravitational power is therefore @xmath58 where we replaced the parameters of the viscous time scale with the ratio of viscous to keplerian time @xmath59 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lmax ] ) sets the upper bound on the ots in the etd , plotted as blue line at the upper edge of the ots .",
    "we note that the location of this line may change if the accretion efficiency @xmath32 is different and/or the stellar parameters of the accreting star are different . for most of the ilots",
    "the accretion efficiency is lower , hence they are located below this line , giving rise to the relatively large width of the ots .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath60 is large and in extreme cases may be even @xmath61 . therefore ,",
    "on rare occasions we expect to find objects slightly above the upper line drawn in the figure .",
    "we here take the view that the systems populating the peak - luminosity region , or total energy region , between novae and sne are not a collection of different kinds of objects .",
    "rather , we think that the typical total energy ( kinetic + radiated ) of these events ( termed ilots ) points to one basic energy source : the gravitational energy of mass accreted onto , or merged with , a main - sequence star",
    ". the energy scale of ilots comes from the basic properties of main - sequence stars , namely , that they burn hydrogen .",
    "first , the potential on their surface is related to the hydrogen ignition temperature by equation ( [ eq - ms1 ] ) .",
    "second , the available energy for a major event is the mass a companion can supply times the potential .",
    "the typical mass in a merger process is that of another main - sequence star . in a case of a mass transfer from the envelope of an evolved star a similar",
    "mass is available . in many cases",
    "less mass is transferred , and the total energy is lower even ( section [ sec : time ] ) .",
    "the power of the basic engine that leads to ilots is limited by viscosity that limits the duration of the process from below .",
    "this in turn constrains the power of the event from above .",
    "this time is derived in section [ sec : time ] and drawn by the thick blue line on figure [ fig : totevst ] ."
