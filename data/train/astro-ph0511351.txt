    "small - angle scattering of x - rays by dust grains can produce a ` halo ' around a distant x - ray source , with a radial intensity distribution that depends on the dust properties and location ( overbeck 1965 ; hayakawa 1970 ; trmper & schfelder 1973 ) .",
    "this effect was first detected by rolf ( 1983 ) using _ einstein _ observations of the bright x - ray binary gx  @xmath8 , and has subsequently been observed around several other bright galactic x - ray sources ( e.g. catura 1983 ; predehl & schmitt 1995 ; predehl 2000 ) .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) produce high x - ray fluxes for short periods , typically @xmath9",
    "s. viewed through a substantial column of galactic dust , these impulsive x - ray events may produce halos that appear to expand on the sky because x - rays scattered at larger angles travel a slightly longer path length to the observer and suffer an increased time delay . this time delay , between the direct and scattered light , means the later observations of the scattered light provide a view of the grb x - ray emission at earlier times and can , in principle , provide details of the location , spatial distribution and properties of the dust ( e.g. alcock & hatchett 1978 ; klose 1994 ; miralda - escud 1999 ; draine & bond 2004 ) . in particular , assuming the grb to lie at a cosmological distance , the distance to the scattering dust can be measured from the radial expansion of the halo , because the halo size increases as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the time since the pulse of illuminating x - rays and @xmath12 is the distance between the dust and observer .",
    "observations of grb dust haloes can thereby provide very accurate distances to galactic structures , as first demonstrated by vaughan ( 2004 ) using an  observation of the  grb  031203 .",
    "this paper discusses the x - ray halo around , the first halo discovered by  ( romano 2005 ) and only the second ever observed around a grb .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows : section  [ sect : data ] discusses the  observations and basic data analysis ; section  [ sect : burst ] describes the x - ray properties of the burst counterpart during the first few ks of the observation ; section  [ sect : halo ] discusses the detailed analysis of the x - ray halo images ; section  [ sect : rass - iras ] uses the archival  and  data to probe the ism in the direction of the grb ; and finally the implications of the results of this analysis are discussed in section  [ sect : disco ] . throughout this paper",
    "the quoted errors correspond to @xmath13% confidence regions unless stated otherwise .",
    "at 2005 - 07 - 24 12:34:09 ut the  burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy 2004 ) triggered and located  ( covino 2005 ) .",
    "the prompt bat light curve showed a relatively short - lived spike , with a fwhm of @xmath14  s ( covino 2005 ; krimm 2005 ) , plus an extended low - flux tail lasting for at least @xmath15  s. as discussed by barthelmy ( 2005 ) , this burst would have been classified a short burst if observed by batse .",
    "the total fluence was @xmath16  erg @xmath17 ( krimm 2005 ) over the @xmath18  kev band .",
    "the spectrum evolves from relatively hard during the @xmath19  s peak ( photon index of @xmath20 ) to much softer ( @xmath21 ) at @xmath22  s after the trigger .",
    "the spacecraft slewed immediately to the bat on - board calculated position ; the  x - ray telescope ( xrt ; burrows 2004 , 2005a ) began observations at 12:35:22.9 ut ( in automatic state ) , only @xmath23  s after the bat trigger , and detected a rapidly fading , uncatalogued x - ray source at ( j2000 ) ra=@xmath24 , dec@xmath25  @xmath26  @xmath27 ( with a @xmath13% confidence radius of @xmath28 ; barthelmy 2005 ) .",
    "this position is close to the galactic plane ( @xmath29 ) ; the expected column density of neutral galactic gas along this line - of - sight ( los ) is @xmath30 @xmath17 ( as measured from @xmath31  cm maps ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) , and the reddening @xmath32 ( from the ir dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "follow - up observations revealed a variable optical and radio source within the xrt error circle ( @xmath33  from the xrt position ; gal - yam 2005 ; soderberg 2005 ) .",
    "a @xmath34  ks  observation further refined the position of the fading x - ray source and showed it to be coincident with the optical and radio transient ( burrows 2005b ) .",
    "prochaska ( 2005 ) identified the host galaxy of the transient to be a massive early - type galaxy at a redshift of @xmath35 ( from ca h+k and g - band absorption ) .",
    "see also berger ( 2005 ) for a discussion of the host galaxy optical spectrum .",
    "the xrt collected data in windowed - timing ( wt ) mode from @xmath36  s post - burst ( wt mode allows imaging in one spatial dimension only ) , after which time the data were taken in photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "wt mode allows imaging in one spatial dimension only , whereas pc mode produces two - dimensional images , see hill ( 2004 ) for a full description of the xrt operating modes .",
    "the xrt data were processed by the  data center at nasa / goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) to level @xmath19 data products ( calibrated , quality flagged event lists ) .",
    "these were further processed with xrtpipeline v0.8.8 into level @xmath37 data products . in the subsequent analysis",
    "only event grades @xmath38 were used for the wt mode data and only grades @xmath39 were used for the pc mode data .",
    "spectra and light curves were extracted from the wt data using a @xmath40 pixel ( @xmath41 ) wide box to define the source and background regions . for the pc mode data ,",
    "source counts were accumulated from within a circle of radius @xmath42 pixels ( @xmath43 ) , and background data were accumulated within an annulus having inner and outer radii of @xmath44 and @xmath45 pixels ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the appropriate ancillary response matrices were generated using xrtmkarf v0.4.14 .",
    "the spectrum of the wt data ( @xmath36  s post - burst ) was binned such that each spectral bin contained at least @xmath47 counts and fitted over the @xmath48  kev range  kev to avoid calibration uncertainties at lower energies . ]",

    "the spectral model comprised a power law continuum modified by two neutral absorbers ( modelled using the tbabs code of wilms , allen & mccray 2000 ) , one at @xmath49 and the other at @xmath1 , corresponding to neutral interstellar gas in our galaxy and intrinsic to the grb host galaxy , respectively . allowing both column densities to be free parameters , this simple model gave a very good fit ( @xmath50 for @xmath51 degrees of freedom , dof ) with best - fitting parameters as follows : @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath17 and @xmath54 @xmath17 . the galactic column density inferred from the x - ray spectrum",

    "figure  [ fig : image ] shows the xrt ( pc mode ) images from the first , second and later orbits of , over the @xmath57  kev energy range ( only events with energies @xmath57  kev were used since the halo has a soft spectrum , as discussed in section  [ sect : halo - spec ] , and was not detected above @xmath58  kev ) .",
    "the first orbit showed extended emission around the point - like grb which was dispersed in the second orbit and was difficult to detect in later orbits . in order to better quantify this extension ,",
    "images were accumulated in five non - overlapping time intervals : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62  s from the first orbit and @xmath63  s from the second orbit .",
    "radial profiles were calculated for each image by accumulating the counts in annuli centred on the grb ( see figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "the expanding halo was revealed by the small but significant localised excess of counts , beyond the unresolved grb , or fwhm@xmath64 at @xmath65  kev ( moretti 2005 ; burrows 2004 ) ] .",
    "the radius of the halo as a function of time , @xmath66 , was estimated by fitting each radial profile ( using xspec ) with a model comprising the psf of the source ( a king profile with parameters taken from ground based calibration data ; moretti 2004 , 2005 ) plus a constant background level ( per pixel ) , integrated over the annular bin .",
    "a gaussian was added to represent the profile of the halo , fixing the width to be equal to @xmath67% of the radius : @xmath68 ( see section  [ sect : comoving ] ) . the @xmath69-statistic was used to find the maximum likelihood model parameters , appropriate for the case of few counts per bin ( @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the likelihood ; cash 1979 ) . for each profile ,",
    "the @xmath69-statistic was minimised and the maximum likelihood position of the gaussian was used as the radius of the halo in that image .",
    "the @xmath13% confidence region for the radius was estimated using the @xmath72 values ( see figure  [ fig : c - stat ] ) .    figure  [ fig : expansion ] shows the radius of the halo in each of the five time bins , as measured using the radial profiles .",
    "these data were fitted with the function @xmath73 , which describes the radial expansion of a dust - scattered halo following a ( short ) x - ray pulse at time @xmath74 ( e.g. trmper & schfelder 1973 ; klose 1994 ; miralda - escud 1999 ; draine & bond 2004 ) . strictly speaking ,",
    "this assumes a very narrow pulse of x - rays and an intrinsically narrow dust scattering screen .",
    "the value of @xmath74 corresponds to the typical arrival time of direct ( un - scattered ) photons , which will be after @xmath75 since the  remained x - ray bright from @xmath75 until @xmath76  s , meaning almost all the direct x - rays actually arrived after @xmath75 .",
    "the best - fitting values of the free parameters were : @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 measured in arcsec ) and @xmath79  s after @xmath75 .",
    "this model gave a good fit , with @xmath80 for @xmath81 dof . in order to check whether the best - fitting value of @xmath74 is plausible , the mean arrival time for the direct x - rays was estimated using the x - ray light curve from the joint bat - xrt data ( figure  3 of barthelmy 2005 ) : the flux - weighted photon arrival time where @xmath82 is the x - ray light curve . ] over this light curve was @xmath83  s , consistent with the best - fitting @xmath74 from the radial expansion curve .",
    "the normalisation , @xmath84 , describes how fast the halo expands and is uniquely determined by the distance to the dust ) will produce any observable effect . ] . assuming the grb to be at a cosmological distance @xmath85 .",
    "the best - fitting normalisation predicts a distance to the scattering medium of @xmath4  pc , where the @xmath13% confidence region was calculated with @xmath74 as a free parameter , an assumption not made in the present analysis . ]",
    "this distance measurement is quite robust to the choice of function used to parameterise the halo radial profile .",
    "this was demonstrated by repeating the radial profile fitting using different functions to model the halo profile .",
    "for each one the halo expansion curve was measured and the distance calculated from its best - fitting normalisation .",
    "a gaussian of fixed width ( @xmath86 ) gave @xmath87  pc , a lorentzian of fixed width ( @xmath88 ) gave @xmath89  pc and a king model as used to model the psf ( see above ) gave @xmath90  pc .",
    "these different estimates are all well within the confidence region of the original estimate , demonstrating that any systematic errors introduced by the choice of radial profile model are smaller than the quoted statistical error .",
    "the radial profile of the halo was examined in more detail by summing the five radial profiles ( figure  [ fig : profiles ] ) , after adjusting the size of the radial bins to correct for the expansion of the halo .",
    "a constant background level , estimated from the mean level at large radii , was subtracted from each profile before combining them .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : comoving ] .",
    "this shows that the average radial profile of the halo , after correcting for its expansion , was reasonably narrow . fitting",
    "this profile using a gaussian to model the halo gave a relative width of @xmath91 ( @xmath13% confidence limit ) .",
    "the observed radial width of the halo is a combination of four terms : ( @xmath92 ) the time profile of the illuminating x - ray pulse ; ( @xmath93 ) the radial distribution of the dust along the line of sight , ( @xmath94 ) the psf of the xrt , and ( @xmath95 ) the radial expansion of the halo over the length of an exposure .",
    "term ( @xmath92 ) is negligible since the time duration of the initial pulse is short compared to the times ( since burst ) of the halo images ( @xmath96  s ) .",
    "the xrt psf ( with fwhm of @xmath97 ) gives rise to a fractional width of @xmath47% in the first image to @xmath58% in the last , meaning term ( @xmath94 ) must contribute significantly to the measured width .",
    "the co - moving radial profile is dominated by counts from later images ( with longer exposures ) , during which the fractional increase in the halo radius  term ( @xmath95 )  was @xmath98% .",
    "the measured width of the halo may therefore be explained entirely by terms ( @xmath94 ) and ( @xmath95 ) , implying the remaining term , the radial thickness of the dust , must be small .",
    "a very conservative limit on the physical thickness of the dust cloud along this line of sight is @xmath99  pc .",
    "most likely the dust is confined in a much narrower region .",
    "the spectrum of the halo was extracted from the first orbit of data using an annular extraction region with inner and outer radii of @xmath47 and @xmath100 pixels ( @xmath101  arcsec ) , respectively .",
    "a background spectrum was extracted from an annulus with radii of @xmath44 and @xmath45 pixels and an appropriate ancillary response file was generated . due to the small number of counts ( @xmath102 ) the spectrum",
    "was fitted using the @xmath69-statistic , rather than binning to @xmath47 counts per bin and fitting using the @xmath103 statistic , which would result in very few bins .",
    "the spectral model used was an absorbed power law , with the neutral absorption column density fixed at the value obtained from the early xrt spectrum ( @xmath104  @xmath17 ; section  [ sect : burst ] ) .",
    "the data are shown in figure  [ fig : halo - spec ] .",
    "the best fitting photon index was @xmath105 , significantly steeper than the grb x - ray spectrum ( @xmath106 ) , as expected due to the strong energy dependence of the dust scattering cross section .",
    "the model gave a good fit , with a rejection probability of only @xmath107 estimated using @xmath108 monte carlo simulations .",
    "the mean photon energy in the binned , background subtracted halo spectrum was @xmath109  kev .",
    "the flux decay of the halo was also estimated using the radial profile of the combined image from orbits @xmath19 and @xmath37 ( over which the halo is well - detected ) .",
    "counts were accumulated in annuli of width @xmath110 ( @xmath111 pixels ) and background subtracted assuming a constant background level per pixel estimated from an annulus enclosing @xmath112 .",
    "the sampling of the halo as a function of angle is incomplete , due to the incomplete time coverage of the observation , therefore radii over which the halo was not observed were masked out of the radial profile .",
    "the masking was done by converting the times of the observations into radii using the best - fitting expansion curve ( figure  [ fig : expansion ] ) and removing all radial bins containing unobserved angles .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : decay ] .",
    "the total fluence of scattered light ( in the halo ) , @xmath113 , should be related to the direct light ( i.e. un - scattered light from the grb ) , @xmath114 , by : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the scattering optical depth , with @xmath117 the total scattering cross - section and @xmath118 is the dust grain column density along the los ( e.g. equation  14 of mauche & gorenstein 1986 , henceforth mg86 ) . for low optical depths ( @xmath119 ) , where multiple scattering is insignificant , this can be approximated by @xmath120 .",
    "the above quantities represent the entire halo ( integrated over all scattering angles ) but the scattering cross - section is a function of angle which defines the halo fluence per unit angle . in the rayleigh - gans approximation  kev and typical grain sizes . ] the differential scattering cross - section for a spherical grain of size @xmath121 ( in units of @xmath122 m ) is given by : @xmath123 ^ 2 ( 1+\\cos^2 \\theta ) \\label{eqn : cross - sect}\\ ] ] ( equation 2.2 of hayakawa 1970 ) where @xmath124 is a normalisation that depends on the energy of x - rays being scattered , @xmath125 and @xmath126 is the spherical bessel function of the first order .",
    "the central core of this function is approximately gaussian , leading to a halo with a characteristic size @xmath127  arcsec ( equation  6 of mg86 ; hayakawa 1970 ) . using equation  [ eqn : cross - sect ] the scattered fluence in the halo per unit scattering angle",
    "is : @xmath128 ^ 2 ( 1+\\cos^2 \\theta ) n_{\\rm g } f_{\\rm x } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\propto & a^6 \\theta",
    "\\left [ \\frac{j_1(x)}{x}\\right]^2 ( 1+\\cos^2 \\theta ) \\label{eqn : scat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which peaks at @xmath129 .",
    "this function was fitted to the data ( solid curve in figure  [ fig : decay ] ) yielding a best - fitting value of @xmath130 m ( with a @xmath13% confidence region of @xmath131 m ) , assuming a typical energy of @xmath132  kev for the scattered x - rays ( see section  [ sect : halo - spec ] ) .",
    "the scattering of soft x - rays is dominated by the largest grains , due to the strong dependence of the scattering cross - section on grain size ( the total scattering cross section , integrated over all angles is @xmath133 ) , and so this estimate for @xmath121 corresponds to grains close to the maximum grain size .",
    "this best - fitting model was integrated over all angles to estimate the total halo fluence of @xmath134 counts ( where the @xmath135 error was approximated by the @xmath67% fractional error on the total observed halo fluence ) .",
    "the above calculation is valid for a single grain size which should be a reasonable approximation given the strong dependence of the scattering cross - section on @xmath121 .",
    "the presence of smaller grains will however cause the halo fluence to fall off less rapidly at large angles and this extended ` tail ' could contain substantial additional fluence .",
    "in order to investigate the consequence of a continuous grain size distribution , equation  [ eqn : scat ] was re - calculated at each angle by integrating over the grain size distribution @xmath136 . the size distribution was assumed to follow that of mathis , rumpl & nordsieck ( 1977 ; hereafter mrn ) : @xmath137 the revised function was fitted to the data assuming @xmath138 m and @xmath139 , yielding a best - fitting @xmath140 m ( with a @xmath13% confidence region @xmath141 m ) , this is slightly larger than , but not inconsistent with other estimates derived from x - ray haloes ( mg86 ; predehl 1991 ; clark 2004 ) .",
    "the best - fitting model is also shown in figure  [ fig : decay ] ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "the fit is not very sensitive to @xmath142 m or @xmath143 m changed the fit statistic by only @xmath144 or @xmath145 , respectively . ]",
    "as long as @xmath146 and @xmath147",
    ". the total fluence in this model , integrated over all angles , was virtually identical to the single grain size model ( @xmath148 counts ) , although the fluence could be higher if there is a greater contribution from smaller grains scattering to larger angles that were not directly observed .",
    "given the above estimate of the halo fluence , @xmath113 , it is possible to estimate the dust scattering optical depth once the direct grb x - ray fluence , @xmath114 , is known .",
    "this latter quantity can be estimated by integrating the combined xrt - bat light curve of the burst .",
    "figure  3 of barthelmy ( 2005 ) shows the x - ray light curve of  from @xmath149 .",
    "this was produced using the xrt observations after @xmath150  s , and the @xmath151  kev bat light curve extrapolated into the xrt band based on a spectral fit to the simultaneous bat and xrt spectrum . during the first @xmath152  s after the trigger the x - ray source was bright ; the wt data contain @xmath153 source counts ( @xmath154  kev ) .",
    "the extrapolated bat data predict almost exactly the same number of counts prior to the start of the xrt / wt observation . although there will be a systematic error associated with the extrapolation of the bat data to lower energies , the tight agreement between bat and xrt data in the interval of overlap suggests this is likely to be small ( barthelmy 2005 ) . together",
    "these give a total of @xmath155 counts . combining this with the @xmath113 value of section  [ sect : decay ] gave @xmath156 . making an approximate correction to an effective scattering optical depth at @xmath19",

    "archival  and  data were used to constrain the ism in the direction of .",
    "the top two panels of figure  [ fig : rass - iras ] show the soft x - ray sky around , derived from the  all - sky survey ( rass ) data in the @xmath159  kev band , and the bottom panel shows the all - sky survey @xmath160 m map of the region .",
    "these images reveal structures dominated by the ophiuchus molecular cloud complex casting the dark ` shadows ' in the  map ( middle panel ) and enhanced ir dust emission in the  map ( lower panel ) .",

    "these data were used to estimate the column density in the cloud by comparing the column density estimates for the grb position to those at locations ` a ' and ` b , ' chosen to be representative of nearby but off - cloud lines - of - sight .",
    "the column densities were estimated in three independent ways , and the results are presented in table  [ tab : nh ] .",
    "the first estimates comes from the dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) @xmath31  cm maps of @xmath162 .",
    "this shows little change in @xmath162 between the three positions ( see table  [ tab : nh ] ) , and this was confirmed by the @xmath31  cm map of the region shown by de geus & burton ( 1991 ; see their figure  5 ) .",
    "the column density due to the intervening cloud in the direction of  was estimated from the difference between the column density towards the grb and the mean of that measured for a and b. this gave @xmath163 @xmath17 ( where the uncertainty is a very rough estimate based on half the difference between a and b ) .",
    "in other words there is no excess h  i in the direction of due to the intervening dust cloud .",
    "the second estimate comes from the ir reddening maps from schlegel ( 1998 ) this gave @xmath164 values , based on the temperature and  intensity at the position of interest , of @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 for the grb , a and b , respectively .",
    "these correspond to optical estinctions of @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively , assuming @xmath171 as measured by vrba , coyne & tapia ( 1993 ) in the direction of the @xmath161 oph cloud .",
    "the reddening values were converted to hydrogen column densities assuming @xmath172 @xmath17 ( diplas & savage 1994 ) . in this case the excess column density over the grb was @xmath173  @xmath17 . however , as noted by jura ( 1980 ) , vuong ( 2003 ) and others , the dust - to - gas conversion factors in the direction of the oph cloud are uncertain due to the complexity of modelling the cloud medium .    the third estimate was derived from rass spectra extracted using @xmath174 radius regions centred on the positions of the grb , a and b. these were fitted with the model developed by willingale ( 2003 ) but , due to the complexity of the model and low resolution of the data , most parameters were fixed at the values found from an analysis of nearby  fields ( m. a. supper , in prep . ) .",
    "the two parameters allowed to vary in the fit were the foreground absorption column density and the emission measure of the `` loop i super - bubble '' ( indicated by the large circle in the top panel of figure  [ fig : rass - iras ] ) .",

    "the x - ray halo around , as observed by the  xrt , has provided accurate information on the galactic dust distribution in this direction . in particular",
    ", the narrow halo must be caused by a concentration of dust at a distance of @xmath177  pc from earth , in a cloud or sheet with a thickness @xmath5  pc .",
    "the radial profile of the halo constrains the size of the largest grains to be @xmath178 m , but the contribution from smaller grains is unconstrained because the halo was not detected at scattering angles larger than @xmath179 .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath180 is higher than the often used value of @xmath181 m ( mrn ; see also predahl & schmitt 1995 ) , although this is not without precedent as jura ( 1980 ) previously noted that the non - standard optical extinction curves in the direction of @xmath161 ophiuchus may signify the presence of unusually large grains .",
    "the los to  includes the upper scorpius subgroup of the scorpius - centaurus ob association at a mean distance of @xmath182 pc ( derived from  data ; de zeeuw 1999 ) .",
    "there is considerable structure in the extinction maps around this region , including material belonging to the ophiuchus molecular cloud complex ( de geus 1992 ) .",
    "knude & hg ( 1998 ) detected a sharp rise in the reddening at @xmath183  pc in the direction of the @xmath161 oph star forming region , which is consistent with the distance measured for the dust responsible for the x - ray halo .",
    "if the x - ray scattering dust is associated with part of the oph molecular cloud complex , this gives the most accurate measurements to date for the distance to the cloud and its physical thickness .",
    "the excess optical extinction in the direction of the , compared to the mean of the off - cloud positions ` a ' and ` b ' , was @xmath184 mag ( section  [ sect : rass - iras ] ) . in combination with the estimated halo scattering optical depth ( section  [ sect : tau ] )",
    "this gives @xmath185 at @xmath19  kev .",
    "this is lower than the value of @xmath186 estimated by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) using  observations of bright galactic x - ray sources , and a factor of a few lower than the value derived from the model of draine ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , the halo around  was only observed at small angles ( @xmath187 ) and so the flux contribution from smaller grains is largely unconstrained , meaning that the true halo flux , and hence @xmath188 , is probably larger .",
    "as shown by figure  [ fig : rass - iras ] , the x - ray absorption and ir dust emission are well - correlated , demonstrating they are caused by the same medium . by contrast",
    "the @xmath31  cm map shows little correlation with these images ( figure  5 of de geus & burton 1991 ) , suggesting the cloud medium has a comparatively low density of atomic h  i. the most obvious explanation is that the hydrogen is molecular , although there is no obvious co emission from this location in figure  3 of de geus , bronfman & thaddeus ( 1990 ) .",
    "the ly-@xmath189 map of the region ( see figure  13 of de geus 1990 ) shows two nearby h  ii regions , known as s9 and rcw 129 , around the stars @xmath117 sco ( b1 iii ) and @xmath190 sco ( b0 v ) , respectively .",
    "it is therefore also plausible that some fraction of the atomic hydrogen is ionised by these nearby young stars ( with distances of @xmath191  pc ; shull & van steenberg 1985 ) .",
    "the total galactic hydrogen column density along the los to  is therefore the sum of that revealed by the @xmath31  cm h  i maps and that inferred from the molecular cloud ( mostly h@xmath192 and/or h  ii ) .",
    "the @xmath31  cm measurement of the total h  i column density gave @xmath193  @xmath17 , whereas the column density in the dust cloud was measured at @xmath194  @xmath17 from the excess ir emission and @xmath195  @xmath17 from the excess soft x - ray absorption ( section  [ sect : rass - iras ] ) .",
    "the total hydrogen column density is therefore in the range @xmath196  @xmath17 , slightly lower than that measured from the grb x - ray spectrum ( @xmath197  @xmath17 ; section  [ sect : burst ] ) .",
    "it is of course possible that this extra x - ray absorption along the los to  ( @xmath198  @xmath17 ) is caused by either a modest column of molecular or ionised gas on the far side of the sco - cen super - bubble , or due to cold gas in the grb host galaxy , the formal constraint on which was @xmath199 @xmath17 ( section  [ sect : burst ] ) .",
    "_ note added in proof : _ since the completion of this paper tiengo & mereghetti ( 2005 ) have announced the detection of another dust - scattered x - ray halo around a grb .",
    "this brings the total number of known grb x - ray halos to three .",
