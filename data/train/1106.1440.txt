    "the disk model is strongly supported by interferometric observations that resolve the circumstellar emission at near - ir and mid - ir wavelengths on scales @xmath2 r@xmath3 .",

    "we present ki observations of the three prototypical fu ori objects : fu ori , v1057 cyg , and v1515 cyg .",
    "our data probe the entire @xmath7-band and are sensitive to emission from the br@xmath8 transition of hydrogen and the ro - vibrational overtone transitions of co. we determine the relative spatial distributions of line and continuum emission in these systems , providing critical tests of circumstellar disk models .",
    "ki is a fringe - tracking long baseline near - ir michelson interferometer combining light from the two 10-m keck apertures @xcite .",
    "each of the 10-m apertures is equipped with a natural guide star adaptive optics ( ngs - ao ) system that corrects phase errors caused by atmospheric turbulence across each telescope pupil , and thereby maintains spatial coherence of the light from the source across each aperture .",
    "optical beam - trains transport the light from each keck aperture down into a tunnel connecting the two kecks and to a set of beam combination optics .",
    "we used the `` self phase referencing''(spr ) mode of ki , implemented as part of the astrometric and phase - referenced astronomy ( astra ) program ( see woillez et al .",
    "2011 for a description of the spr mode ) .",
    "spr allows deep integrations in a spectroscopic channel , which enables higher dispersion without loss of signal - to - noise .",

    "the effective bandpass of our observations is approximately 2.15 to 2.36 @xmath12 m .",
    "we obtained keck interferometer ( ki ) observations of v1057 cyg on 2009 july 15 , of v1515 cyg on 2010 july 21 , and of fu ori on 2010",
    "november 25 ( all dates ut ) . on each night",
    "we also observed spatially unresolved stars of known spectral types , used to calibrate the instrumental response .",
    "the calibrator stars are hd 192985 and hd 195050 for v1057 cyg ; hd 194206 and hip 102667 for v1515 cyg ; and hd 37147 and hd 42807 for fu ori .",
    "we measured fluxes , squared visibilities ( @xmath13 ) , and differential phases ( @xmath14 ) for our targets and calibrator stars in each of the 330 spectral channels across the @xmath7-band provided by the grism ( figures [ fig : fuori][fig : v1515cyg ] ) .",
    "the data calibration is described in detail in @xcite , but we provide a basic sketch here .",
    "normalized fluxes are calculated by dividing observed source and calibrator spectra and then multiplying by an appropriate stellar template for the calibrator ( given by a nextgen model atmosphere ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the absolute flux level and slope of the spectra",

    "we do not include the uncertainty in the overall normalization of the @xmath13 .",
    "differential phases  i.e .",
    ", the phase in each spectral channel relative to some fiducial channel  are calibrated by subtracting the @xmath14 measured for the calibrator stars .",
    "the broadband slope and curvature of the measured differential phases are altered by instrumental effects .",
    "the slope is altered by errors in group delay tracking , and curvature in the phase versus wavelength may be introduced by atmospheric water vapor turbulence and dispersion and refraction during internal beam - transport ( see * ? ? ?",
    "hence we can not attribute any broadband slope or curvature in the data to the observed source .",
    "we therefore remove the slope and curvature seen across our bandpass from the differential phase data , as described in @xcite .",
    "all objects in our sample show strong absorption in the spectral regions corresponding to the co ro - vibrational bandheads , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( figures [ fig : fuori][fig : v1515cyg ] ) .",
    "the rest wavelengths of these three bandheads are 2.2936 , 2.3227 , and 2.3527 @xmath12 m , respectively .",
    "fu ori and v1057 cyg also show dips in @xmath13 at the wavelengths corresponding to these spectral features .",
    "v1515 cyg may show similar dips relative to the @xmath13 seen in adjacent channels corresponding to continuum emission , but these dips are not significant given the noise in these data .",
    "lower @xmath13 generally means more resolved emission .",
    "however , because the co appears in absorption , the dips in @xmath13 actually indicate that the co distribution is more compact than the continuum emission .",
    "this can be understood by considering a compact , hot region of the disk that includes co absorption , and a cooler , continuum - emitting region at larger radii . at wavelengths where co absorbs emission from the hot , compact component , the flux - weighted size of the two regions moves to larger stellocentric radii .",
    "thus , the compact co absorption leads to a larger measured size at these wavelengths , and hence a dip in @xmath13 .",
    "the observed differential phases indicate a centroid offset between the continuum emission and the co absorbing material .",
    "this offset is most obvious for fu ori , and marginally significant for v1057 cyg . for v1515",
    "cyg the data are too noisy to argue the presence or absence of such an offset .",
    "differential phase offsets in the co bandheads indicate that the annuli of the disk that have appropriate temperatures for co absorption in their spectra must have centroids that differ from annuli that are too hot for co to exist or cool enough that they produce continuum emission .",
    "the spectra for all objects show an absorption feature at the central wavelength of br@xmath8 , 2.1662 @xmath12 m .",
    "in addition , the spectra show hints of some emission on the red side of the line .",
    "these spectral shapes are consistent with p cygni profiles seen in other hydrogen lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one object ",
    "v1057 cyg  also shows a significant dip in @xmath13 in the br@xmath8 spectral region .",
    "since the line is predominantly seen in absorption , the same argument applied to co above suggests that the br@xmath8 absorption occurs in more compact regions than the continuum emission .",
    "the br@xmath8 feature is more prominent in the spectrum of v1057 cyg than in fu ori or v1515 cyg ; the higher line - to - continuum ratio of br@xmath8 in this object may explain why the @xmath13 dip is only seen here .",
    "the co bandhead features are much broader in v1057 cyg than in other objects in our sample .",
    "these broad features do not appear to be due to instrumental effects . during the night of our v1057 cyg observations , we observed known co - emitting objects immediately before and after v1057 cyg",
    ". neither of these objects show such broad features ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we also verified that the appearance of the co features in v1057 cyg persists across multiple observations and for different calibrator stars .",
    "thus the broadening seen in the co lines of v1057 cyg appears to be intrinsic to the source .",
    "in this section we attempt to create a physically - motivated cirumstellar disk model to explain the measured fluxes , squared visibilities , and differential phases . in our modeling",
    "we assume that the emission from our targets arises entirely from circumstellar material . in previous modeling of fu ori sources",
    "spectrophotometric data has been fitted well with no contribution from a compact stellar photosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore do not require any correction for unresolved flux from the central star .",
    "we begin with a geometrically thin disk model .",
    "we assume the disk spans a range of radii from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , and has a temperature profile @xmath20 .",
    "we divide the disk up into a series of annuli and assume the emergent spectrum of each annulus is that of a supergiant star . for fu",
    "ori stars this is a reasonable assumption since they are heated primarily from accretion energy released near the midplane .",
    "disk atmosphere models have been constructed specifically for fu ori systems , and these do provide better fits to detailed spectrophotometric data than models based on stellar atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we are , however , not concerned with this level of detail here , and we deem our models based on giant star atmospheres to be sufficient .    for annular temperatures between 1700 and 10000 k",
    ", we use emergent spectra for stars with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "( in practice , the maximum temperature is typically between 4000 - 6000 k. ) for @xmath22 k , we assume that the emission is a simple blackbody .",
    "the emergent spectrum is rotationally broadened by the keplerian velocity expected for each annulus , @xmath23 .",
    "we take @xmath24 m@xmath3 for our objects ; this is compatible with the dynamical mass of @xmath25 m@xmath3 for fu ori determined by @xcite and the pre - outburst spectral type of v1057 cyg .",
    "the spectrum of the disk model is given by the sum of fluxes over all annuli .",
    "the visibility of each annulus is given by the visibility of a uniform ring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the visibilities for the entire disk are computed as the flux - weighted average of the annular visibilities : @xmath26    the differential phase is related to the centroid offset . for each annulus ,",
    "the differential phase is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 radius ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath30 is the centroid offset .",
    "this approximation is valid as long as the emission is not well - resolved at the angular resolution of the observations .",
    "the differential phase signal for the entire model is ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath31 as described above , the slope and curvature of the observed , broadband differential phase are altered by instrumental effects .",
    "we therefore remove broadband slope and curvature from both observed and modeled @xmath14 .",
    "the simple , geometrically thin disk model considered above would not produce centroid offsets .",
    "however if we allowed the disk to be somewhat asymmetric , certain disk radii could have centroids offset from those of other disk radii .",
    "we allow for the possibility of such asymmetry by including a centroid offset that changes linearly with disk radius .",
    "this aspect of the model is described by a single free parameter that gives the amplitude of this offset .",
    "we denote this amplitude by @xmath32 .    to account for the possibility that some of the near - ir emission arises from more",
    "spatially extended regions  for example in remnant envelopes ( as implied by the results of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we include a scattered light contribution in our models .",
    "while there may also be thermal emission from a more extended component , the cooler temperatures at large stellocentric radii would produce a very small fractional flux in the near - ir .",
    "we assume that the extended , scattered emission has the same spectrum as the disk , and is sufficiently extended so that is is completely resolved ( @xmath33 ) in our observations . writing the fractional scattered flux , @xmath34 ,",
    "the model fluxes and visibilities are modified to @xmath35 @xmath36    finally , we include two scaling factors in the model that take into account additional uncertainties not reflected in the error bars for the data .",
    "the first is a constant scaling in the overall flux level , @xmath37 .",
    "this scaling accounts for uncertainties in the flux calibration beyond the assumed channel - to - channel errors , including uncertainties in the 2mass photometry used to normalize the spectra , or source dimming between the photometric and interferometric observations .",
    "we also include a constant scaling in the overall @xmath13 normalization , @xmath38 , to account for overall calibration uncertainties beyond the channel - to - channel uncertainties reflected in the plotted error bars .",
    "these two scale factors may also absorb uncertainty in the assumed source distances ( table [ tab : sample ] ) .",
    "it turns out that these scaling factors are near unity in our best - fit models , and hence are not crucial to the fitting process ; we include them for completeness .    for fu",
    "ori , the disk inclination and position angle have been measured using previous interferometric observations .",
    "in the near - ir the inclination and position angle were estimated as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively @xcite . in the mid - ir ,",
    "the inclination and position angle were found to be @xmath39 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the near - ir - determined values here . for v1057 cyg and v1515 cyg ,",
    "no such geometrical measurements are available , and so we leave inclination and position angle as free parameters in our models .",
    "we can not , however , constrain these well with the limited @xmath29 coverage of our observations .",
    "given the large numbers of free parameters , we fit our models to the data using a non - linear gradient - fitting algorithm based on the levenberg - marquardt method .",
    "such algorithms may fall into local minima in the @xmath42 surface , and so initial parameter guesses and step sizes for gradient searches influence the results .",
    "we have selected step sizes that ensure that all free parameters are varied during the fitting process .",
    "however we are hesitant to claim that the``best - fit '' models we determine are the true , global best fits .    to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the fitting , we only use data with wavelength between 2.15 and 2.36 @xmath12 m to constrain the models . data at the band edges are substantially noisier because of instrumental vignetting and contributions from ambient water vapor ( pott et al .",
    "2010 ; woillez et al .",
    "our best - fit disk model for fu ori is shown in figure [ fig : fuori ] .",
    "the model fits quite well in this wavelength region ( reduced @xmath43 ) .",
    "while the modeled differential phases do not match the observations perfectly , this is likely due to imperfectly subtracted slope and curvature ( which are instrumental effects ) . indeed ,",
    "residual curvature of the differential phase data forces the best - fit model toward a flat differential phase versus wavelength .",
    "if we consider the differential phase data only over the narrower spectral region containing the co bandheads ( where broadband slope and curvature effects are less important ) we can easily construct a model that agrees with the data well . in particular , we use the best - fit model parameters for fu ori listed in table [ tab : results ] , increase the value of @xmath44 , and subtract a constant phase offset . note that @xmath44 has no impact on the fluxes or @xmath13 values and",
    "so we are free to modify its value in order to better - fit the differential phases .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig : fuori ] shows that a model with a large centroid offset , @xmath45 mas , produces a differential phase signature that agrees well with the observations in the co bandhead region .",
    "the differential phase signature seen for fu ori thus can not be explained with a simple , geometrically thin disk model .",
    "rather we require a centroid offset that depends on stellocentric radius .",
    "a disk warp can obscure part of the outer regions of a disk while leaving the inner regions unobscured ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the centroid offsets implied by our data suggest that the fu ori inner disk may be significantly warped . in our model",
    "this warp occurs over stellocentric radii spanning 0.07 au to 0.49 au .",
    "disk winds may also cause centroid offsets that vary as a function of stellocentric radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since all of the sources in our sample are known to be losing mass via winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this may be an alternative explanation for the differential phase signatures seen in the data . in any event",
    ", the large differential phases observed across the spectral region including co bandhead absorption indicate substantial geometric asymmetry in the underlying emission from fu ori .",
    "the outer radius derived for fu ori is @xmath46 au , similar to the @xmath461 au value derived in the the sed modeling of @xcite .",
    "this likely represents the outer radius of the hot , high - accretion rate , inner disk component .",
    "as argued in @xcite , this implies that the high accretion rate in fu ori is probably not caused by pure thermal instability , but rather gravitational or mri instability . note that a larger @xmath19 value is not required to fit the broadband sed , and our model fits photometry out to @xmath47 @xmath12 m well . to fit longer",
    "wavelength photometry requires an additional model component such as a flared disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for v1057 cyg the disk model does not fit the co bandhead features well ( figure [ fig : v1057cyg ] ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath42 residuals of the fit to our @xmath7-band data are 1.9 .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the extremely broad co overtone absorption features . for an assumed 0.5 m@xmath3 central object",
    ", the keplerian velocities do not exceed @xmath11 km s@xmath6 , and hence the modeled co bandheads are not broadened significantly .    a higher inclination would yield higher @xmath48 values , but would also lower the modeled flux and make it difficult to fit the observations . moreover even for @xmath49 the synthetic spectra are still not as broad as the data",
    ". a higher central mass can also increase the keplerian velocities .",
    "however @xmath50 m@xmath3 is required to produce the @xmath51 km s@xmath6 broadening seen in the data . a stellar mass",
    "this high is not ( remotely ) compatible with the pre - outburst , k - spectral type determined for v1057 cyg @xcite .",
    "such high velocities could , however , be created by a rotating disk wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "v1057 cyg is known to possess a variable , high - velocity wind @xcite .",
    "if this wind dominated the near - ir absorption during the epoch of our observations , it may explain the broad co absorption features in our data .",
    "while previous observations of v1057 cyg found the co bandheads to be narrower than inferred here @xcite , the co overtone absorption spectra show substantial variability @xcite . when the wind is more dominant , the accretion luminosity generated in the disk midplane",
    "may be absorbed by co ( and other matter ) with radial velocities substantially higher than keplerian .",
    "rotating disk - wind models are substantially more complex than the simple disk models considered here . rather than creating an accurate wind model ,",
    "we demonstrate the overall features of such a model with a simple modification of our baseline disk model .",
    "specifically , we scale up the keplerian rotation profile to account for the possibility of higher radial velocities due to outflowing motions .",
    "figure [ fig : v1057cyg ] shows that a model with substantially higher radial velocities does indeed fit the data better than the simple disk model .",
    "here we scaled the disk velocity structure up ( arbitrarily ) by a factor of 30 , so that the co lines are broadened by @xmath52 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this model fits the data substantially better than the keplerian disk model considered above ; the high - velocity model produces a reduced @xmath42 value of 1.3 .",
    "while the fit deviates from the data for the co @xmath53 transition , this deviation may be due , in part , to lower signal - to - noise of the data toward the band edge .",
    "our best - fit disk model also fails to reproduce the @xmath13 dip in the br@xmath8 spectral region observed for v1057 cyg .",
    "because the inner disk temperature is @xmath54 k for our best - fit disk model , there is essentially no br@xmath8 absorption in the model spectra . to explain the br@xmath8 feature seen in the data would require an additional model component with a higher temperature .",
    "this component would also have to be reside at very small stellocentric radii ( @xmath55 au , which is more compact than the distribution of co - absorbing material ) to produce the observed dip in @xmath13 . across the k - band ,",
    "a simple disk model is not an obvious match to our observations of v1057 cyg .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 observed for v1515 cyg are noisy compared to the data for the other two objects in our sample .",
    "v1515 cyg is more than a magnitude fainter than v1057 cyg , and @xmath56 mags fainter than fu ori , and so more noise is expected .",
    "v1515 cyg is near ( but within ) the brightness limit of the spr mode , beyond which signal - to - noise degrades significantly ( woillez et al .",
    "however , lower throughput near the band edges means that the signal - to - noise is degraded more in the spectral region including co. this low signal - to - noise gives rise to the un - physically large @xmath13 ( i.e. , normalized @xmath57 ) seen for @xmath58 @xmath12 m .",
    "the fluxes for v1515 cyg appear reasonably consistent with our simple disk model ( figure [ fig : v1515cyg ] ) .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not very consistent with the data , as seen in the high reduced @xmath42 value for the fit ( table [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "the large @xmath42 value is due , at least in part , to underestimated uncertainties .",
    "the large @xmath13 seen at the long - wavelength edge of the band are unphysical , and so the plotted error bars are clearly underestimated . over most of the band",
    "the model appears compatible with the noisy @xmath13 and @xmath14 data .",
    "we presented near - infrared , spatially resolved , spectroscopic observations of fu ori , v1057 cyg , and v1515 cyg , obtained with the keck interferometer . with @xmath59 across the @xmath7-band , we spectrally resolved individual co bandheads as well as the br@xmath8 transition of hydrogen .",
    "our measured fluxes , squared visibilities , and differential phases were compared with simple accretion disk models .",

    "the observed co bandhead features are broader than expected for a disk in keplerian rotation .",
    "the disk model also fails to reproduce compact br@xmath8 emission seen in the data .",
    "we speculate that a rotating , high - velocity , inner disk wind may be contributing substantially to the observed near - ir emission in this source , at least at the epoch of our observations .",
    "overall this study suggests a more complex explanation for the near - ir observations of three canonical fu ori stars than the unified picture of a simple accretion disk model .",
    "in addition to a rotating disk undergoing viscous accretion , outflow is also likely to be an important element in the interpretation of radiative and kinematic data .",
    "while the namesake object , fu ori , is consistent with a simple accretion disk model , v1057 cyg is not .",

    "<S> we present keck interferometer observations of the three prototypical fu orionis stars , fu ori , v1057 cyg , and v1515 cyg . with a spatial resolution of a few milli - arcseconds and a spectral resolution of @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> our near - infrared observations spatially resolve gas and dust emission extending from stellocentric radii of @xmath1 au to several au . </S>",
    "<S> we fit these data with accretion disk models where each stellocentric radius of the disk is represented by a supergiant - type stellar emission spectrum at the disk temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a disk model is consistent with the data for fu ori , although we require some local asymmetry in the disk . for v1057 cyg the disk model does not fit our data well , especially compared to the fit quality achieved for fu ori . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that a disk wind may be contributing substantially to the observed near - ir emission in this source . </S>",
    "<S> the data for v1515 cyg are noisier than the data obtained for the other two objects , and do not strongly constrain the validity of an accretion disk model . </S>"
