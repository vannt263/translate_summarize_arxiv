    "the mergers of neutron star , black hole , and neutron star - black hole binaries provide the most promising sources of gravitational waves for detection by laser interferometers now being constructed , such as ligo and virgo .",
    "a variety of additional factors also motivate the study of binary neutron star systems : for example , such systems are known to exist with several having been detected in our galaxy in the form of binary radio pulsars ( eg . @xcite and references therein ) , and coalescing neutron stars may be a source of gamma - ray bursts at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "these facts have motivated numerous theoretical studies of the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries . until recently ,",
    "such calculations have involved either post - newtonian ( pn ) point mass approximations or purely newtonian hydrodynamic treatments .",
    "analytic analyses of the gravitational radiation waveforms have been performed in the pn approximation with the binary components , whether black holes or neutron stars , being treated as point masses @xcite . these investigations are therefore appropriate in the early inspiral phase when the stars are still well separated and tidal effects can be safely neglected .",
    "semi - analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite studies of the coalescence waveform from binary neutron stars also have been performed using newtonian hydrodynamics and the quadrupole radiation approximation .",
    "these studies treat newtonian effects arising from the finite size of the interacting fluid stars and focus on their tidal distortion , disruption , and eventual merger .",
    "numerical simulations of coalescing black hole and neutron star binaries are also underway in full general relativity ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . complicated by the challenges of treating both matter and strong gravitational fields in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional spacetime , these simulations are essential for obtaining definitive , quantitative results for the highly relativistic interactions which generate the late inspiral and final coalescence waveforms .",
    "there is an important distinction between binaries in newtonian theory and those in general relativity : in newtonian theory a binary can exist in true dynamic equilibrium , but in general relativity true equilibrium can not exist because of the generation of gravitational waves . for binaries with sufficiently large orbital separation ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the orbital decay time due to emission of gravitational waves is much longer than the orbital timescale , so that the inspiral is quasi - static through a sequence of quasi - equilibrium configurations .",
    "the inspiral becomes dynamic and quasi - equilibrium is destroyed with the onset of relativistic orbital instabilities ( @xmath5 few @xmath6 ) .",
    "dynamic behavior may also commence when the purely newtonian tidal instability is reached near @xmath5 few @xmath7 ( eg . , @xcite ) .",
    "for these reasons , both newtonian and relativistic effects are important .    in the relativistic simulations of wilson , mathews , and marronetti @xcite ,",
    "the time - dependent equations of relativistic hydrodynamics are solved in a simplified , strong - field background , and the system is relaxed to find quasi - static equilibrium configurations of corotating neutron star binaries for a specific equation of state .",
    "these authors claim that neutron stars just below the maximum ( isolated ) mass become unstable and collapse to black holes when placed in close binary orbits , in contrast to the newtonian result that the tidal field tends to stabilize a star ( see fig .",

    "@xcite ; also ref .",
    "such collapse could significantly affect the inspiral and the associated gravitational waveform , and therefore deserves careful attention .",
    "recently , baumgarte et al .",
    "@xcite have constructed quasi - static binary equilibrium models in full general relativity . however , their numerical models , based on a polytropic equation of state , are restricted to be corotating .",
    "this work complements the numerical analysis of cook @xcite , who analyzed binary black holes with zero spins .",
    "a fully general relativistic calculation of a binary neutron star configuration is a computationally intensive problem .",
    "by contrast , an ellipsoidal figure of equilibrium ( efe ) treatment , while only approximate , can find an equilibrium configuration in less than a second on a typical workstation .",
    "this speed affords a quick means of gaining a qualitative understanding of the stellar models and equilibrium sequence .",
    "these sequences can help provide a better understanding of the general relativistic solutions which are now being generated ( eg . ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , while general relativistic codes are currently limited to corotation , or near corotation , an efe treatment allows straightforward construction and comparison of both corotating and irrotational sequences .",
    "the second order variation of the functional can be used to identify instabilities , e.g. the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) or the collapse of a massive neutron star in a binary to a black hole .",
    "furthermore , both secular and dynamical instabilities can be identified and distinguished .    taniguchi and nakamura @xcite",
    "use the efe approach to model black hole - neutron star binaries in the roche approximation , using a pseudo - potential to model the strong - field orbital motion .",
    "lai and wiseman @xcite insert efe terms in the hybrid - p@xmath8n dynamical equations of motion , which are then integrated to identify the isco .",
    "the efe approach has also recently been extended to first pn order in treatments of corotating binaries @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the efe energy variational method , extended to first pn order .",
    "our energy functional includes terms for both the internal hydrodynamic structure as well as the external orbital motion .",
    "we add the leading pn correction to the internal and self - gravitational energy of the stars .",
    "we adopt the hybrid expressions of @xcite , to pn order , to give the orbital terms ; these expressions are exact in the test mass limit and correct to pn order for arbitrary masses .",
    "the energy functional is varied to find quasi - equilibrium configurations of both corotating and irrotational binary sequences , parameterized by orbital separation ( or orbital angular velocity ) .",
    "in  [ approximations ] we outline the basic approximations of our efe scheme . in ",
    "iii we give the various energy , angular momentum , and circulation terms which comprise our functionals .",
    "the method of solution is discussed in ",
    "iv , and results are presented in ",
    "v. finally , we discuss the implications of our results and directions for future work in  vi . in the appendices ,",
    "we derive the pn energy contributions for an isolated spherical star obeying a polytropic equation of state .",
    "in this section , we describe the fundamental approximations and assumptions behind our energy variational method , which we apply to construct general darwin - riemann equilibrium models .",
    "further details and applications of our method can be found in @xcite .    in steady state ,",
    "an isolated , self - gravitating binary system is characterized by conserved global quantities such as the rest ( baryonic ) mass @xmath9 and @xmath10 of each star and the total angular momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the total energy of the system can be written as a functional of the rest mass density and velocity distributions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , even if the system is not in equilibrium . in principle , an equilibrium configuration can be determined by extremizing this energy functional with respect to all variations of @xmath12 and @xmath14 that leave the conserved quantities unchanged .",
    "the fundamental approximation of our method is to replace the infinite number of degrees of freedom contained in @xmath12 and @xmath14 by a finite number of parameters @xmath15 , so that the total energy is a function only of these parameters : @xmath16 an equilibrium configuration is then determined by extremizing the energy according to @xmath17 where the partial derivatives are taken holding the conserved quantities @xmath18 constant .",
    "an expression like equation  ( [ lrs4.2.1 ] ) can be written down only with the help of simplifying assumptions .",
    "we adopt the compressible ellipsoidal approximation to model the neutron stars , i.e. we assume they are triaxial ellipsoids supported in hydrostatic equilibrium by a polytropic equation of state @xcite",
    ". surfaces of constant density are assumed to be concentric self - similar ellipsoids .",
    "these approximations become exact in the limit that the fluid is incompressible and the gravitational potential is strictly newtonian and truncated beyond the tidal term @xcite . for compressible configurations ,",
    "this simplification is equivalent to using an ellipsoidal trial function in an energy functional and then extremizing the functional to find the equilibrium solution .",
    "comparisons with numerical simulations show that the ellipsoidal model is reliable , particularly for stars obeying stiff equations of state @xcite .",
    "the velocity field of the fluid is taken to be that of a riemann - s ellipsoid , in which all internal velocities are linear functions of the coordinates ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ,  5 , for details ) .",
    "the vorticity vector is assumed to be everywhere parallel to the orbital rotation axis . since the viscosity in neutron stars is thought to be negligible",
    ", the two stars will conserve circulation as they inspiral @xcite , so that slowly spinning neutron stars at @xmath19 will maintain a small , constant circulation .",
    "however , current general relativistic quasi - equilibrium codes are forced to consider corotating , or nearly corotating , sequences rather than sequences of constant circulation .",
    "we therefore concentrate on two interesting limiting cases : irrotational sequences ( for non - synchronized systems with zero circulation ) and corotating sequences ( corresponding to synchronized binary systems in uniform rotation ) .",
    "consider a binary system composed of two stars of rest mass @xmath9 and @xmath10 in circular orbit . throughout this paper",
    "unprimed quantities refer to the star of rest mass @xmath9 while primed quantities refer to the star of mass @xmath10 . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we denote the mass ratio as @xmath20 . the density and pressure are related by @xmath21 note that our treatment allows the two stars to have both distinct polytropic indices ( @xmath22 ) and polytropic constants ( @xmath23 ) , although in this paper we concentrate on the case of two identical stars .",
    "the binary separation is denoted by @xmath24 , and the principal axes of the two ellipsoids by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the orientation is such that @xmath25 and @xmath28 are measured along the binary axis , @xmath26 and @xmath29 in the direction of the orbital motion , and @xmath27 and @xmath30 along the rotation axis . in place of the three principal axes @xmath31 , it is often convenient to introduce as independent variables the central rest mass density @xmath32 , and two oblateness parameters defined as @xmath33 similarly we can introduce @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 in place of the three @xmath37 .",
    "thus the seven independent variables which parameterize our models are @xmath38 .    as is standard in efe treatments , we assume that the density profile @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mass interior to an isodensity surface , is identical to that of a spherical polytrope with the same @xmath41 and @xmath0 , but with radius @xmath42 [ see eq .",
    "( [ ov - based ] ) ] .",
    "in particular , to pn order , a star with semi - major axes @xmath31 has the same central density as a spherical star ( not necessarily in equilibrium ) with radius @xmath7 in schwarzschild coordinates , @xmath43 \\right\\ } , \\label{rhoofr}\\ ] ] where we have used equations ( [ surface ] ) and ( [ final.aofm ] ) .",

    "although equation  ( [ rhoofr ] ) originates from a pn expansion , our code treats this relation as exact .",
    "we now review the energy , angular momentum , and circulation terms in the newtonian efe approximation , which has been covered in detail in @xcite .",

    "the subscript oi serves as a reminder that these terms couple the orbital motion to the internal structure of the neutron stars .",
    "although including @xmath134 and @xmath135 as part of @xmath129 in equations ( [ eoi ] ) and ( [ joi ] ) amounts to keeping terms which are formally of p@xmath8n order , doing so keeps our energy functional accurate even for stars at @xmath19 but with @xmath136 ; excluding @xmath134 and @xmath135 from @xmath129 would lead to an energy functional which yields manifestly incorrect results for isolated stars ( in particular , the stability of a star would depend on the velocity of the observer ) .",

    "pn internal motion is especially small , since the fluid motion in the inertial frame is always predominately set by the orbital motion .",
    "we are also neglecting all pn tidal terms ( but see  [ future.work ] ) .",
    "the total energy and angular momentum functionals used in our treatment are therefore @xmath138 and @xmath139 since we are approximating the internal fluid motion as newtonian , we continue to use equation  ( [ lrs4.2.20 ] ) for the circulation .",
    "in order to find an equilibrium solution , we must extremize the energy function @xmath140 while holding all the quantities @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath11 constant .",
    "we are therefore identifying those configurations for which the energy is unchanged to first order by any perturbation which conserves rest mass , circulation , and total angular momentum .",
    "an equilibrium sequence is constructed by repeating this extremization at various values of the orbital separation @xmath24 . in the case of corotation , the stars are members of the riemann - s family with vorticity @xmath143 , and although the perturbations considered conserve circulation , the circulation does indeed vary along the equilibrium sequence itself @xcite .",

    "the irrotational sequences maintain a lower maximum mass than their corresponding corotating sequences , because corotating stars ( a ) have more rotational support and ( b ) are more ellipsoidal so that the newtonian tidal field has more of a stabilizing effect .",
    "the relative increases in @xmath261 is more gradual for @xmath2 than @xmath51 , because @xmath2 stars near the maximum mass are much more centrally condensed than @xmath51 stars near their maximum mass : from table [ isolated.spherical.models ] we see that both the central density parameter @xmath262 and the compactness parameter @xmath1 are much larger for the maximum mass @xmath2 star ( log @xmath263 , @xmath264 ) than the @xmath3 star ( log @xmath265 , @xmath266 ) .",

    "we note that the last equation of ( [ non.dimensional ] ) does not apply here , although by construction it is satisfied to pn order when @xmath32 has its equilibrium value .",

    "for instance , since @xmath374 in the range @xmath375 , and since @xmath376 , @xmath377 therefore equation ( [ udm ] ) becomes @xmath378    in order to write our final answer in the form of equation ( [ deltaeself ] ) , we need to derive a relation between @xmath379 and the total rest mass @xmath9 . from our knowledge of newtonian polytropes we expect ( @xmath380 , and we can obtain a relation accurate to pn order by evaluating @xmath9 : @xmath381 making use of @xmath382 in equation ( [ aofm ] ) gives @xmath383 where @xmath335 . we evaluated the integral in equation ( [ almost.final.aofm ] ) with the help of equations ( [ dbeta ] ) and ( [ justified ] ) . equation ( [ final.aofm ] ) is our desired relation between @xmath384 and @xmath9 .",

    "using equation ( [ final.udmprime ] ) and the definition of @xmath387 in equation ( [ upn.app ] ) gives @xmath388 or , after using equations ( [ qc.ov-based ] ) and ( [ final.aofm ] ) to lowest order and simplifying , @xmath389 the relation @xmath390 can be used to reduce the double integral in equation ( [ almost.final.l1 ] ) to a single integral : @xmath391 if desired , the identity [ which can be proved from equations ( [ dalpha ] ) and ( [ dbeta ] ) and appropriate integrations by parts ] @xmath392\\ ] ] could be used to further manipulate equation ( [ final.l1 ] ) when @xmath393 , while for @xmath3 this integral can be evaluated using equation ( [ alpha.n=1 ] ) .",
    "however , we find it more convenient to work with equation ( [ final.l1 ] ) directly .    equation ( [ final.l1 ] ) is our final expression for the coefficient @xmath120 , and was obtained by evaluating equation ( [ upn.app ] ) with the ov - based trial density functions defined in equation ( [ ov - based ] ) .",
    "we could proceed to calculate @xmath121 from equation ( [ wpn.app ] ) in a similar manner .",
    "however , it is more straightforward to take the following approach .    rearranging equations ( [ define.epn ] ) and ( [ deltaeself ] ) yields the pn accurate energy functional for an isolated spherical star , not necessarily in equilibrium , obeying a polytropic equation of state : @xmath394 along an _ equilibrium _ sequence we have @xmath395 , which gives , to lowest order , @xmath396 indeed , equation ( [ hydro.equil ] ) is the same relation obtained by writing the newtonian equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in terms of lane - emden functions and simplifying . to pn order , the energy along an equilibrium sequence therefore satisfies @xmath397    since here we are focusing on the equilibrium sequence , the first variational derivative of @xmath140 with respect to the density functional must vanish ; therefore , any variation in the density profile of pn order causes a variation in the energy of order p@xmath8n , so that it is sufficient to use lane - emden profiles when evaluating the newtonian order integrals in @xmath351 .",

    "<S> using an energy variational method , we calculate quasi - equilibrium configurations of binary neutron stars modeled as compressible triaxial ellipsoids obeying a polytropic equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> our energy functional includes terms both for the internal hydrodynamics of the stars and for the external orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> we add the leading post - newtonian ( pn ) corrections to the internal and gravitational energies of the stars , and adopt hybrid orbital terms which are fully relativistic in the test - mass limit and always accurate to pn order . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy functional is varied to find quasi - equilibrium sequences for both corotating and irrotational binaries in circular orbits . </S>",
    "<S> we examine how the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit depends on the polytropic index @xmath0 and the compactness parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for a given @xmath1 , the innermost stable circular orbit along an irrotational sequence is about 17% larger than the innermost secularly stable circular orbit along the corotating sequence when @xmath2 , and 20% larger when @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the dependence of the maximum neutron star mass on the orbital frequency and find that , if pn tidal effects can be neglected , the maximum equilibrium mass increases as the orbital separation decreases . </S>"
