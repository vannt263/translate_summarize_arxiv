    "smse an smte ( see , for example , @xcite ) this transition , being typical for the whole series @xcite , is related to the closure under pressure of the semiconducting gap @xmath9 , whose values at zero pressure are listed in table [ summary ] .",

    "the first and , in fact , the only study of the pressure effect on magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 of sms was performed at room temperature and pressure @xmath1 up to 18 kbar by maple and wohlleben @xcite .",
    "they observed a distinct drop in @xmath22 at @xmath21 by about 65% within 0.5 kbar and further decrease of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath1 , but at a much slower and decreasing rate . in the context of the present report",
    ", we would like to note observation of a marked increase in susceptibility of semiconducting sms at low pressures , which is described by the derivative d@xmath0/d@xmath23 emu / mol@xmath24kbar .",
    "an initial increase in @xmath0 at room temperature with d@xmath0/d@xmath25 and @xmath26 emu / mol@xmath24kbar was also reported for smse and smte , respectively @xcite .    as it follows from comparison of the experimental values of magnetic susceptibility at @xmath27 k for sms , smse and smte with the van vleck susceptibility of sm@xmath5 free ions at zero temperature , @xmath28 emu / mol @xcite ,",
    "the van vleck contribution in @xmath0 of smx is the basic one .",
    "its value is determined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the multiplet splitting , @xmath31  k @xcite . since this contribution has the intra - atomic origin and",
    "would weakly depend on interatomic distance , the observed large pressure effect on @xmath0 in sms and related compounds is , at first glance , unexpected and surprising .",
    "it should be noted that the magnitude of this effect correlates reasonably with the value of an excess susceptibility , @xmath32 .",
    "besides , as can be seen , the value of @xmath0 ( and @xmath33 ) in the series smte@xmath34smse@xmath34sms increases with reduction of @xmath9 , and the positive sign of the pressure effect on @xmath0 coincides with experimentally observed decrease of @xmath9 under pressure @xcite . based on the foregoing",
    ", one can assume that the excess susceptibility term @xmath33 , being very sensitive to applied pressure , is closely related to the electronic structure and its changes under pressure .",
    "because of the high sensitivity to interatomic distances , the results of the experimental studies of magnetic properties under pressure provide the efficient tool to verify the theoretical descriptions of magnetism and its relation to electronic structure of samarium chalcogenides .",
    "in this paper we have carried out the precise study of the pressure effect on magnetic susceptibility of semiconducting sms in order to complete and validate the previous experimental data @xcite .",
    "the obtained results have been compared with the predictions of the existing model approaches .",
    "polycrystalline samples of samarium monosulfide were prepared by the method described in ref .",
    "a powder x - ray diffraction analysis revealed that the samples consist mainly of the nacl phase of sms ( @xmath35 ) and some amount of sm@xmath36s@xmath37 and sm@xmath38o@xmath38s impurity phases .",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility @xmath39 of sms was measured by a faraday method in the temperature range of @xmath40  k at magnetic field of @xmath41  koe . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ x(t ) ] , the observed dependence is in close agreement with literature data for sms that testifies to rather high quality of the prepared sample and a negligible contribution of impurity phases to its magnetism .",
    "the precise study of the uniform pressure effect on magnetic susceptibility of sms was carried out under helium gas pressure @xmath1 up to 2 kbar , using a pendulum type magnetometer .",
    "the measured sample was placed inside a small compensating coil located at the lower end of the pendulum rod . then under switching on magnetic field ,",
    "the value of current through the coil , at which the magnetometer comes back to its initial position , is the measure of the sample magnetic moment . to measure the pressure effects ,",
    "the pendulum magnetometer was inserted into a cylindrical nonmagnetic pressure chamber which was in turn placed into a cryostat .",
    "measurements were performed at fixed temperatures , 78 and 300 k , to eliminate the effect on susceptibility of the temperature change during applying or reversing pressure . for detailed description of the device and analysis of the sources of the experimental errors ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite . in our case",
    ", the relative errors of measurements of @xmath0 under pressure did not exceed 0.1% for the employed magnetic field @xmath42  koe .",
    "the experimental @xmath22 dependencies , normalized to value of @xmath0 at zero pressure , are presented in fig .",
    "[ x(p ) ] . to check the data reliability ,",
    "the @xmath22 dependencies were measured for two samples with different mass ( 120 and 55 mg ) and appeared to be identical within experimental errors .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ x(p ) ] , the @xmath22 behavior shows a pronounced increase in @xmath0 under pressure .",
    "it should be noted that a weak nonlinearity with positive curvature of @xmath22 dependence is observed for @xmath43  k. for @xmath44  k the pressure effect is linear within experimental errors .",

    "firstly we note without comments a quantitative difference between the pressure effect value at room temperature obtained here , dln@xmath0/d@xmath48 mbar@xmath4 , and that resulted from the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite , dln@xmath0/d@xmath49 mbar@xmath4 . in either case , the initial increase of the magnetic susceptibility with pressure correlates qualitatively with behavior of the zero - pressure susceptibility of sms , smse and smte compounds as a function of their lattice parameter @xmath18 at ambient conditions ( fig .",
    "[ x(a ) ] ) .",
    "by this way , the effect of chemical pressure can be estimated as @xmath50 at @xmath27 and 300  k , respectively . using the corresponding values of @xmath51ln@xmath0/@xmath51ln@xmath52 and @xmath53 , which follow from fig .",
    "[ x(a ) ] , and the bulk modulus value for sms , @xmath54 mbar @xcite . as is seen from ( [ dx / da ] ) and table  [ exp ] ,",
    "the estimated value of the chemical pressure effect is about 30% of the external pressure effect both at low and at room temperatures , giving evidence for its strong temperature dependence . besides , it is obvious that difference in the magnetic properties along the smx family is governed not only by variations in the interatomic distance , but also the chemical nature of the anion .",
    "there are a few approaches to explain the positive pressure effect on magnetic susceptibility for semiconducting sms .",
    "for example , maple and wohlleben @xcite assumed that this effect arises from a decrease under pressure of the multiplet splitting @xmath55 of the sm@xmath5 ion due to increased screening of the nuclear charge , caused by increasing hybridization of the 4f states with d states of the sm ion across the decreasing semiconducting energy gap @xmath9 .",
    "however , this assumption is hardly consistent with a commonly believed proximity of the @xmath30 energies along the series of sms , smse and smte compounds @xcite which have significantly different values of the lattice parameter and semiconducting gap @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , as it follows from neutron - scattering studies in the semiconducting phase of sms @xcite , there is no observable change in the value of @xmath30 under pressure , which is close to that for the free sm@xmath5 ion .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to conclude that the van vleck contribution of sm ions is pressure independent and presumably the same in magnitude for the smx series .    to explain the origin of the observed excess term in susceptibility of sm chalcogenides , birgeneau",

    "@xcite have estimated the exchange parameter and its variation with chemical pressure .",
    "it was concluded @xcite that the obtained information provides a remarkable description of the pressure dependence of the smx susceptibility @xcite within the proposed simple theory .",
    "however , it should be noted that i ) the chemical pressure effect differs essentially from that of the external pressure , ii ) the estimated values of d@xmath0/d@xmath1 at @xmath27 k @xcite were unreasonably compared with experimental data @xcite at room temperature . besides , an origin of the strong dependence of exchange interaction on the interatomic distance is not clear .",
    "below we propose an alternative description of magnetic properties of the smx series , based on the data in figure [ x(eg ) ] , where the magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature is presented as a function of the inverse value of semiconducting gap of the compounds .",
    "as is seen , the susceptibility can be satisfactorily described , excepting the data for smte , as    k @xcite versus the inverse semiconducting gap @xmath9 .",

    "analysis of the obtained experimental results within approach , based on a phenomenological heisenberg exchange between sm@xmath5 ions @xcite , gives , in our opinion , only qualitative agreement with experiment .",
