    "repulsive interactions play the role of the pauli exclusion principle and the many - body wavefunction can be exactly obtained by mapping onto the one of noninteracting fermions @xcite .",
    "experimental advances on trapping and cooling ultracold bose - fermi mixtures @xcite and the possibility of trapping both species in tight atomic waveguides have boosted a theoretical activity on 1d mixtures . at increasing boson - fermion repulsions ,",
    "mean - field @xcite and luttinger liquid analysis at weak coupling @xcite predict an instability towards phase separation ( i.e. demixing ) of the two components . for a highly symmetric model with equal masses and coupling constants ,",
    "further progress can be made by use of exact solutions .",
    "for the homogeneous system , a bethe - ansatz solution is known @xcite and no demixing is found .",
    "the long - wavelength properties of its correlation functions have been studied using conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneous systems , as in the case of experiments , bring about novel issues , such as the spatial structure of the ground state . at intermediate interaction strength",
    "a partial demixing of the two clouds has been found by a local density approximation on the bethe - ansatz solution both at zero and finite temperature @xcite . in the tonks - girardeau limit of infinitely strong boson - boson and boson - fermion repulsions a large ground state degeneracy",
    "is expected @xcite , and is associated to the freedom of fixing the sign of the many - body wavefunction under the exchange of a boson with a fermion . for an inhomogeneous system ,",
    "one exact solution of the degenerate manifold has been proposed in @xcite and analyzed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding density profiles display no demixing among the two species . till now no expression was known for the other wavefunctions of the manifold . in this work we solve several open theoretical issues .",
    "first of all we find an exact analytical solution for all the wavefunctions of the degenerate manifold in the tonks - girardeau limit , thus generalizing the solution of @xcite .",
    "secondly , we characterize the solutions in terms of their symmetry properties according to group theory considerations . at difference from fermionic or bosonic spinor systems",
    "@xcite , where the state of the system can be labelled on the basis of the spin quantum number , in order to label the states of the bose - fermi mixture we introduce a suitable casimir operator which reflects the mixed symmetry under particle exchange .",
    "furthermore , we find that such symmetry considerations allow for the understanding of the shape of the momentum distribution , which depends on the choice of the wavefunction within the manifold .",
    "finally , by linear combination of the basis wavefunctions of the degenerate manifold we individuate the wavefunction which corresponds to the ground state at finite , large and equal interactions strengths , and we confirm this prediction by comparing with numerical dmrg simulations . for the nontrivial case of the bose - fermi mixture with large degeneracy , this analysis allows for the first time to draw a link between the bethe - ansatz solution of the homogeneous system and the tonks - girardeau solution of the inhomogeneous system .",

    "the ground state has a large degeneracy @xmath9 , which can be interpreted as choosing @xmath0 positions for the bosons out of @xmath10 , and amounts to fixing in several possible ways the sign of the wavefunction under the exchange of bosons with fermions .    in order to determine an orthonormal basis set for the degenerate manifold we proceed as follows .",

    "to build the required basis for the manifold , we now collect the snippets which correspond to exchanging only the positions of the bosons or of the fermions _ among themselves _ , using the fermi or bose statistics to fix the relative sign of the various terms .",
