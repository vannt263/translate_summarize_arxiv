    "therefore @xmath64 , while the mean - field @xmath57 decay is restored when @xmath65 .    in the physically relevant dimensions ,",
    "the asymptotic decay of the concentration is therefore @xmath66    interestingly , in one and two spatial dimensions the coarsening domain mosaic ( fig .",

    "thus the density profile of each particle species , namely @xmath19 particles in the half space @xmath89 and @xmath53 particles in the half space @xmath90 , is close to that of independent diffusing particles in the presence of an absorbing boundary at @xmath73 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient depends on both concentrations , @xmath91 , so is not a closed equation .",
    "away from the reaction zone , however , one of the species dominates .",

    "we simplify @xmath105 using eqs .   and and equate the result with the flux to yield @xmath108 from which @xmath109 we see that the width of the reaction reaction zone exhibits a rather slow growth @xmath84 , while the width of the depletion zone grows diffusively , @xmath83 .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath110 asymptotically vanishes and this provides an a posteriori justification of the usage of the absorbing boundary condition .",
