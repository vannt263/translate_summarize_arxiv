    "the idea that the physical spacetime might have more than three spatial dimensions dates back to the beginning of the 20th century and to the attempts of nordstrm , kaluza and klein to unify gravity and electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "these early ideas have been resurrected in the present - day string theories which unify gauge theories and gravity in a ten or eleven dimensional spacetime .",
    "extra dimensions were originally thought to be compactified to extremely short distances .",
    "however , according to some new ideas developed within the string theories some of them could be relatively large and could have phenomenological consequences testable in physics experiments .",
    "it has been realized that the presence of large extra compact spatial dimensions could make the fundamental planck scale @xmath0 , that is the planck scale associated with the higher - dimensional spacetime , much smaller than it is in the ordinary four - dimensional world @xcite@xcite . this would offer an attractive solution to the hierarchy problem , i.e.  the disparity of the fundamental energy scales of weak interactions and gravity .",
    "the weakness of the gravity as seen in our visible four - dimensional spacetime , or in other words the largeness of the effective four - dimensional planck scale @xmath1 gev , could be understood to follow from the spreading of the gravity force lines into the extra dimensions .",
    "gravitational interactions have not yet been tested at short distances , and at present experiments still allow some of these extra dimensions to be as large as tenths of a millimeter @xcite . in order to have the planck scale @xmath0 at the tev range , as the solution of the hierarchy problem requires , at least two extra dimensions are necessarily needed @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of the extra dimension scenario is that all the fields charged under the standard model ( sm ) gauge group are localized on a brane , the familiar 3 + 1-dimensional space - time , embedded in the 4+@xmath2-dimensional space , called the bulk @xcite .",
    "this is not only true for the sm non - singlet fermions and scalars , but also for the sm gauge bosons , which are attached to the branes e.g.  due to a gauge trapping mechanism @xcite . in string",
    "theory the sm particles correspond to open strings whose ends are stuck to the branes , while gravitons and other particles that do not carry sm charges correspond to closed strings free to propagate in the extra dimensions ( see e.g.  refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the possible unlocalizability of right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath3 ) in extra - dimension scenarios was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "this feature may turn out to be of crucial importance from the neutrino physics point of view .",
    "the yukawa coupling between the left - handed neutrino @xmath4 , residing on the brane , and the right - handed neutrino @xmath3 , residing wherever in the spacetime , is suppressed by a factor of the order of @xmath5 due to the scarce overlapping of the corresponding wave functions .",
    "this would offer a new and elegant explanation for the lightness of neutrinos .",
    "perhaps the most popular conventional explanation for the lightness of neutrinos is given by the seesaw mechanism , which requires the existence of a new mass scale around @xmath6 gev or higher .",
    "in the extra - dimension scheme such a high mass scale is neither needed nor naturally appears but small neutrino masses follow from the suppression of the yukawa couplings due to the large bulk volume .",
    "the possible existence of bulk neutrinos implies another novel feature .",
    "the momenta of bulk fields are quantized in the compactified extra dimensions , and each of these quantum states corresponds to a massive state , a kaluza - klein excitation , at the brane world .",
    "hence a bulk neutrino would appear as an infinite tower of massive dirac neutrinos in our four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "these new degrees of freedom would hugely enrich the neutrino mass spectrum and neutrino oscillation patterns , as discussed in many recent papers , see e.g.@xcite .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we investigated a model with one large extra dimension paying a particular attention to the effects of the extra dimension in neutrino physics .",
    "the localization of the sm fermions in the four - dimensional space was achieved by introducing a five - dimensional scalar field with position dependent expectation value having a domain - wall profile in the extra dimension @xcite . due to the periodicity of the scalar field in the compactified fifth dimension , there necessarily exists , in addition to the ordinary sm brane , another brane , a mirror brane , in the bulk .",
    "we constructed a concrete mathematical framework that appropriately described this two - brane scheme .",
    "we extracted a finite neutrino mass matrix , of which the massive kaluza - klein modes were integrated out , and studied neutrino masses and mixing from phenomenological point of view .",
    "it was found out that both the neutrino properties and the size of the extra dimension , @xmath7 , are in this scheme severely constrained by experimental data .",
    "especially , @xmath7 turned out to be bounded from below due to the upper limit of the electron neutrino mass set by the tritium beta decay experiments .",
    "the mixing between the ordinary left - handed neutrino and the inert left - handed bulk neutrino is fairly small if @xmath8 mm , but maximal mixing becomes possible for a larger @xmath7 .",
    "a large radius , @xmath9 mm , seemed also to be favored by cosmological arguments .",
    "finally , all the active - sterile neutrino mixing schemes considered as possible solutions to the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies were also found realizable in this model .    as mentioned before",
    ", the hierarchy problem can not be solved if there is only one extra dimension . in this paper",
    "we therefore extend our previous analysis to the case of two extra dimensions .",
    "the two - dimensional extra space is assumed to be compactified on a torus .",
    "the torus geometry allows for a flat metric , which makes various mathematical manipulations quite straightforward .",
    "we are interested in figuring out in which respect this more realistic six - dimensional scheme differs from our previously studied five - dimensional model . in particular , we would like to find out how the requirement of sufficiently large extra dimensions ",
    "so as to solve the hierarchy problem  restricts the parameter space of neutrino physics , that is , mixing angles and squared mass differences .",
    "we will use a similar field - theoretical fermion - trapping mechanism as used in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "we introduce a six - dimensional scalar field that has a vortex - like solution , the field vanishing at the center of the vortex @xcite .",
    "the sm fermions , assumed to be coupled to the scalar field , are then trapped in the core of the four - dimensional vortex , the brane .",
    "the periodicity of the scalar field implies that the vortex must have two vis -  - vis antivortices in both of the extra toroidal dimensions .",
    "consequently , the antivortices require then existence of two vortices , so the vortex configuration consists of two vortices and two antivortices . in other words , besides `` our '' sm brane one has another brane where particles have usual chiralities and two mirror branes containing mirror particles with chiralities opposite to those of their sm counterparts .",
    "in addition to gravitons , only right - handed ordinary neutrinos and their opposite - handed mirror partners are free to propagate in the higher - dimensional bulk .",
    "note that our way of reasoning here is perfectly analogous to the case of one extra dimension @xcite , except that now the number of branes and mirror branes is doubled .",
    "note that the vortex structure on a sphere would be simpler with just one vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "however , the curvature of a sphere is non - zero and therefore no fermion zero modes exist on a sphere @xcite . as a consequence the bulk ( inert ) neutrino structure and the interplay between the bulk and the brane",
    "( active ) neutrinos would be much more complicated .",
    "in the following section we shall introduce the mathematical framework of our six - dimensional scheme and study its effective action in the four - dimensional spacetime . the neutrino mass matrix is derived and a phenomenological analysis of neutrino physics of the model is performed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section we consider a concrete six - dimensional model that exhibits the feature of localizing the left - handed neutrinos on branes and the right - handed mirror neutrinos on mirror branes while letting their gauge inert opposite - handed companions to live in the entire higher - dimensional bulk .",
    "the localization of the gauge active neutrinos is achieved by the field - theoretical method that was discussed in e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and that we applied in our previous analysis of a five - dimensional scenario @xcite .",
    "the two extra dimensions are assumed to be compactified on a torus with radii @xmath10 and @xmath11 . a point in the six - dimensional space",
    "is denoted as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 stands for ordinary spacetime coordinates ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 are periodic coordinates on the torus .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the scalar field ( @xmath16 ) causing the localization is supposed to form two vortices and two antivortices .",
    "a vortex solution is given by @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 const .",
    ", where @xmath20 is a radial coordinate @xcite . for antivortices",
    "one simply changes the sign of @xmath21 .",
    "as will be seen soon , neutrinos are trapped inside a vortex , the throat of which can be viewed as a four - dimensional brane .",
    "the neutrino sector of our model consists of six - dimensional chiral spinors , a left - handed spinor @xmath22 and a right - handed spinor @xmath23 , both associated with active neutrinos , together with a spinor @xmath24 , which is associated with an inert neutrino and which , as will be seen later , can be chosen right - handed .",
    "the fields described by the spinors @xmath22 and @xmath23 are confined to branes or mirror branes , whereas @xmath24 exists everywhere in the bulk .",
    "this choice is a minimal set - up needed to build a successful model on a torus .",
    "however , for technical reasons we will keep for a while both chiral components of the spinor fields in our considerations .",
    "contrary to the five - dimensional case @xcite , two active fields have now to be introduced , in order to accomplish the localization of the fields .",
    "the six - dimensional action of our model is taken to be @xmath25 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a dimensionful yukawa coupling , and @xmath28 corresponds to the ordinary higgs field .",
    "the gamma matrices read @xmath29 where @xmath30 s are the usual four - dimensional gamma matrices , and @xmath31 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath32 s fulfil the six - dimensional clifford algebra @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , by defining the six - dimensional chirality operators , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , one is able to decompose the six - dimensional spinors as @xmath37 and similarly for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the subscript + denotes a right - handed and the subscript @xmath38 a left - handed spinor component in the six - dimensional sense .",
    "the reader should note that we have not presented the gauge boson contributions , free scalar parts , nor the non - neutrino ( fermion ) parts in the action ( [ alku ] ) , but only the parts essential to read out the neutrino couplings .",
    "gauge bosons are , as mentioned earlier in this paper , trapped to the vortices , so that , effectively , each vortex has its own sm gauge bosons , which couple directly only to fermions on the very same brane .",
    "free scalar parts , on the other hand , are the standard ones , and the non - neutrino parts are out of the scope of the present paper .    let us further point out some peculiar features of our action .",
    "the form of the action ( [ alku ] ) follows from the imposition of a global u(1 ) symmetry , under which the fields @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath16 , @xmath24 and @xmath28 are taken to have quantum numbers 1 , -1 , 2 , 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "especially , as will be seen below , the term @xmath39 takes care of the localization of the active neutrinos on the branes .",
    "terms like @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are forbidden by the u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "mass terms @xmath45 and @xmath46 as well as the bulk neutrino majorana mass term @xmath47 , allowed by the symmetry , do not survive as we will put @xmath48 later on .",
    "combinations @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , on the other hand , vanish when the su(2 ) structure is taken into account : @xmath52 s and @xmath28 are the neutral parts of su(2 ) doublets whereas @xmath24 is a su(2 ) singlet .",
    "we start to analyze our model by studying the localization of the brane fermions .",
    "the equations of motion of the fields @xmath53 are @xmath54 where a term @xmath55 has been neglected , since it may be regarded as a small perturbation in the lowest order approximation .",
    "using polar coordinates ( @xmath56 ) , one has @xmath57 and thus eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) can be written in terms of the chiral components of @xmath53 as @xmath58 here we consider the localization on a vortex ( i.e.  @xmath59 ) ; the case of an antivortex localization proceeds along the same lines , with just the chiralities appropriately reversed ( see below ) .    at this point",
    "we return to our original chiral picture by setting @xmath60 .",
    "looking at the first and fourth of equations of ( [ c2 ] ) , it is now natural to require that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this means that @xmath63 , the second sign in the subscript referring to the ordinary four - dimensional chirality of @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath22 is left - handed in four - dimensional sense ) .",
    "similarly @xmath64 , i.e. , the four - dimensional chirality of @xmath23 is left - handed , while its six - dimensional chirality is `` right - handed '' .",
    "furthermore , a solution of the equations of motion apparently exists if @xmath65 .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) now reduce to @xmath66 writing @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 are real functions , and @xmath70 , one ends up with the equations @xmath71 the l.h.s .  of these equations",
    "vanish due to the usual four - dimensional dirac equation for a massless field . if we take @xmath72 , the r.h.s .  can be easily shown to have solutions behaving like . ]",
    "@xmath73 , where , in order to confine @xmath74 to the vicinity of @xmath75 , the plus ( minus ) sign must be chosen for @xmath76 .",
    "this concludes our demonstration of the trapping of the spinor fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 on a vortex by the scalar field @xmath16 .",
    "two comments are worthwhile at this stage .",
    "first , it is straightforward to see what will happen in the antivortex case . substituting @xmath77 to eqs .",
    "( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) , one sees immediately that now a natural choice is @xmath78 , and it is hence the right - handed components @xmath79 and @xmath80 that get localized on an antivortex .",
    "this is of course what one would have intuitively expected to happen a priori .",
    "second , as can be deduced from the second and third of equations of ( [ c2 ] ) , the condition @xmath60 not only makes life easier , but is necessary if _ only _ the left - handed neutrinos ( ordinary active neutrinos ) are wanted to get trapped on a vortex and right - handed neutrinos ( active mirror neutrinos ) on an antivortex .",
    "as is known , there is so far no indication of the existence of mirror neutrinos in our four - dimensional world @xcite .",
    "one may now write somewhat symbolically @xmath81 where the branes ( vortices ) are situated at @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and the mirror branes ( antivortices ) at @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the form of @xmath23 is due to the requirement that ( see above ) @xmath86 modulo a phase factor that can be absorbed to @xmath16 ( or alternatively to @xmath87 ) in the original action of eq .",
    "( [ alku ] ) .",
    "the issue of the higgs field is now more involved than in the five - dimensional case @xcite , and the global behavior of the field is not known in general .",
    "however , since @xmath28 can be locally shown to get trapped on a vortex or an antivortex @xcite , we write @xmath88 where @xmath89 can be viewed as the vev of the higgs field in the @xmath90th brane . by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) and ( [ c5 ] ) , together with a kaluza - klein expansion @xmath91 to eq .",

    "our analysis complies with a `` minimalistic '' view in the sense that we have set @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath24 is taken to be a right - handed chiral field .",
    "we remind that this choice made the dirac and majorana bulk neutrino mass terms to disappear in the original action ( [ alku ] ) .    in order to integrate out the massive kaluza - klein modes , we proceed along the same lines as we followed in our previous study @xcite . this time , however , the ensuing equations are quite lengthy and intransparent and they are mostly omitted in the following presentation .",
    "the first ten @xmath99-dependent terms of the action ( [ vali ] ) disappear due to the equations of motion of the kaluza - klein excitations @xmath100 , for example , @xmath101 and similarly for @xmath102 ( here obviously @xmath103 ) . substituting these twice to the remaining four h.c .- terms of the action , neglecting higher order derivatives of the bulk fields , and regarding @xmath89 s as constants , one obtains @xmath104 \\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . combining then eqs .",
    "( [ vali2 ] ) and ( [ vali ] ) ( with @xmath109 ) , we end up with the effective lagrangian @xmath110 where we have suppressed the chirality indices of @xmath111 s and the kaluza - klein indices of @xmath24 s , rescaled @xmath111 fields with @xmath112 , and we have denoted @xmath113 note that @xmath114 is formally a divergent function .",
    "therefore physical cut - offs @xmath115 , @xmath116 have been introduced in the sums .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",
    "finally , by defining @xmath119 in order to get rid of the kinetic cross terms , and rescaling @xmath120 s with @xmath121 and @xmath122 , eq .",
    "( [ vali3 ] ) may be cast into the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 the explicit expressions of the quantities @xmath125 and @xmath126 are irrelevant for what follows .",

    "( [ vali ] ) , one has , @xmath127 being real , @xmath128 , and thus also @xmath129 and @xmath130 can all be made real .",
    "we now move to consider the phenomenological aspects of our scheme , in particular the effects of the multibrane structure on neutrino physics . apart from gravitons",
    ", only sterile neutrinos can mediate contacts between branes and mirror branes through the bulk , thereby affecting neutrino phenomenology at our home brane .    from the effective lagrangian @xmath131 in eq.([leff ] )",
    "one infers the following mass lagrangian for neutrinos : @xmath132 where the matrix @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 even though @xmath133 can in principle be diagonalized in its general form , this task becomes more straightforward if the branes are assumed to be distributed symmetrically on the torus , @xmath135 .",
    "then @xmath136 , which is easily calculable numerically . ] .",
    "we have made this assumption in the following .",
    "then , as can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ apu1 ] ) , @xmath137 and consequently @xmath138 .",
    "as will be seen later , even this simplified scenario leads to diverse neutrino phenomenology . defining @xmath139 with @xmath140 we obtain @xmath141 where the eigenvalues are @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding mass eigenstates are @xmath145 the neutrino sector thus consists of one massless and two massive dirac neutrinos .",
    "we emphasize that the existence of one massless eigenstate is not an intrinsic feature of our scenario but results from our choice of symmetrically located branes .",
    "another characteristic feature of the model is the imposed right - handed chirality of the bulk field @xmath24 . as mentioned before",
    ", this choice automatically wipes out the six - dimensional dirac and majorana bulk neutrino mass terms , thus removing a usual need to rely on ad hoc arguments .",

    "the angle @xmath153 is related to the right - handed fields @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and is therefore a measurable quantity only on the mirror branes .",
    "it should be pointed out that the physical setting of the neutrino mixing differs in one noteworthy respect from the results of our previous five - dimensional study . in @xcite",
    "the ordinary left - handed neutrino was found to be mixed with an inert left - handed bulk neutrino .",
    "now , as can be seen easily by repeating the calculations similar to those leading to eq .",

    "we have restricted our phenomenological analysis to the electron neutrino , but conclusions would be very similar for the muon and tau neutrinos , since the most important constraint , the cosmological bound for the active - sterile mixing , is quite insensitive to neutrino flavor .",
    "let us finally emphasize that the model we have considered is not the most general one but we have made a number of simplifying , albeit conceivable , assumptions",
