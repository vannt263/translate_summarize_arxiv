    "the emergence of large - scale collective dynamics is one of the most intriguing and fascinating features of a large variety of driven , active systems made of _ active particles _  @xcite .",
    "these are generally elongated and their direction of self - propulsion is set by their own anisotropy ( i.e. , the two ends are distinguishable , hence _ polar _ ) , instead of being determined by an externally imposed field . in contrast , _ active nematics _  @xcite , made of active particles which are head - tail symmetric , do not show any self - propulsion .",
    "these active systems , polar or nematic , are generically characterised by the existence of orientationally ordered states .",
    "these are nonequilibrium analogues of the equilibrium nematic liquid crystals .",
    "there are numerous examples , which include both living systems ( _ living matter _ ) as well as their artificially prepared non - living analogues .",
    "biological examples of active systems include both small and large in - vitro and in - vivo systems , e.g. , reconstituted bio - filaments and the associated motor proteins  @xcite , the cytoskeleton of living cells and bacterial suspensions  @xcite , cell layers  @xcite , and also larger - size objects , e.g. , flock of birds or school of fishes  @xcite .",
    "analogous non - living examples of active matter systems also arise in various contexts , e.g. , layers of vibrated granular rods  @xcite and colloidal or nanoscale particles propelled through a fluid by catalytic activity at their surface  @xcite .",
    "all these examples of active systems are distinguished by a local energy supply in the bulk that drives the systems away from equilibrium .",
    "this is in contrast to other well - known examples of driven systems , e.g. , sheared systems , where the external drives act at the boundaries .",
    "for instance , in cell biology contexts , this supply of energy takes place due to the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) to adenosine diphosphate ( adp ) and other phosphates ( ph ) by the molecular motors , thus converting the chemical fuel into mechanical motion .    despite hugely varying microscopic details",
    ", different active matter systems display a host of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena with generic features independent of system details , e.g. , pattern formations , wave propagations , oscillations and unusually strong fluctuations  @xcite . due to the large number of diverse microscopic variables present ( especially in the cell biology context )",
    ", the level of complexities in active matter systems at microscopic levels is very high .",
    "instead , it is convenient to formulate the coarse - grained dynamics of the active systems based on identifying global features , e.g. , the presence or absence of conservation laws , symmetries , the presence of appropriate broken symmetry variables and the nature of the underlying momentum damping .",
    "these are similar in spirit and nonequilibrium generalisation of the general principles and laws developed to describe the statistical mechanics and dynamics of the ordered phases in equilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "these _ active fluid _ theories , parametrised by a set of phenomenological constants  @xcite , serve as as generic coarse - grained descriptions for a driven orientable fluid with nematic or polar symmetries and are particularly useful to uncover and elucidate the long wavelength behaviour observed in very different physical systems and at very different length scales  @xcite .    in a bulk fluid ( both active and passive ) the viscosity damps out any local momentum gradient and",
    "thus reduces any relative velocities between neighbouring regions .",
    "the total momentum of the system is however kept conserved ; such systems are known as _ wet active matters _ in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite ; see , e.g. refs .",
    "in contrast , for systems resting on a rigid substrate ( e.g. , a layer of active fluid on a solid substrate ) there is a drag on the system acted typically through a no - slip boundary condition on the active matter velocity at the active matter - rigid substrate interface .",
    "this drag leads to nonconservation of the momentum of the active system and cuts off any long - ranged hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "these are known as _ dry active matter _ in the classification used in ref .",
    "@xcite and have been studied extensively , see , e.g. ,  @xcite . the properties of active matter systems are often considered in the form of thin , quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) layer .",
    "such quasi-2d active matter systems exist both _ in - vivo _ and _ in - vitro _ : cell cortex  @xcite or the cortical actin layers and cell ruffles , e.g. , lamellipodia  @xcite are examples belonging to the former category , where as reconstituted actin layers on liposomes  @xcite are examples of 2d _ in - vitro _ active fluid systems .    inspired by the current studies on both wet and dry active matters and their significant differences in terms of their long wavelength properties , we study a generic 2d polar active matter layer , where the active particle system is embedded inside a three - dimensional ( 3d ) bulk isotropic passive fluid . the active fluid and the embedding passive fluid interact via a mutual friction at the interfaces of the active fluid - bulk fluid interface , leading to momentum damping of the active particles . to this end",
    ", we construct a set of 2d continuum equations of motion for the local orientation and number density of the polar active species .",
    "our model , parametrised by the interfacial friction @xmath0 , provides a unified coarse - grained description of the dynamics of polar ordered 2d wet and dry active matters and free standing 2d films . in a linearised treatment about a chosen orientationally",
    "ordered uniform state , we find the linear instabilities in the system .",
    "we also study the nematic limit of the dynamics .",
    "the nature of the linear instabilities are found to depend sensitively on the magnitude of @xmath0 relative to the viscous damping .",
    "our results may be used to estimate bounds on @xmath0 in possible physical realisations of our model , e.g. , reconstituted actin filaments deposited on a liposome embedded in a fluid medium .",
    "in addition , in an _ in - vivo _ system of two eukaryotic cells with a substantial area of contact , the dynamics of the cortical actin layers of the two cells on both sides of the contact plane should be describable by our dynamical equations at a coarse - grained level .",
    "nonetheless , our formulation is sufficiently general and does not specifically relate to any particular cell biological example .",
