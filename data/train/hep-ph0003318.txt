    "of the properties of the top quark , discovered at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , so far only its mass has been directly measured , and , to some extent , its qcd coupling strength via the total production cross section .",
    "there is hope to measure its charged - current coupling , both in strength and handedness , via single - top production at hadron colliders @xcite - @xcite in run ii at the tevatron .    besides having obvious intrinsic value , this measurement has additional importance because the charged - current top coupling might be particularly sensitive to certain signals of new physics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "our context here is however the standard model .    to be sure ,",
    "isolating a clear signal for single top production will not be easy , in view of the complicated final state and the many backgrounds , such as @xmath2 production .",
    "valuable work has recently been done on constructing optimal signal definitions , and examining corresponding backgrounds and acceptances @xcite .",
    "there are various partonic subprocesses that lead to the production of a single top . the ones for which we derive tree - level helicity amplitudes are the `` w - gluon fusion '' process @xmath3 the `` flavor excitation '' process @xmath4 the drell - yan like `` s - channel '' process , which occurs via a virtual timelike w - boson @xmath5 and the `` w - associated '' production process @xmath6 with the w decaying hadronically . in reactions ( [ production1 ] ) and ( [ production2 ] )",
    "it is understood that we may replace the @xmath7-quark pair by @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in reaction ( [ production3 ] ) we may replace the @xmath11-pair by @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , ckm suppressed combinations may be included .",
    "because of its large mass , the electroweak decay of the top quark proceeds so rapidly that top bound states do not have time to form @xcite .",
    "this also means that the decay products of the top quark are correlated with its spin .",
    "it is therefore desirable to include the semileptonic decay of the top quark in the amplitudes : @xmath13    the complete tree - level amplitudes for flavor - excitation and @xmath1-channel production can be obtained by crossing from those for @xmath14 with `` @xmath15 '' representing the vacuum .",
    "likewise , the amplitudes for w - gluon fusion and w - associated production are obtained by crossing from @xmath16    in this paper we present the complete tree - level helicity amplitudes for ( [ amp1 ] ) and ( [ amp2 ] ) .",
    "we obtain compact expressions by using spinor helicity methods .",
    "we present in addition all amplitudes for the subprocesses ( [ production1]-[production4 ] ) in the narrow top width approximation @xcite .",
    "this allows us to check the quality of this approximation against the full calculation , for which only a few of the diagrams actually involve a top quark .",
    "although the helicity amplitudes for ( [ production1]-[production4 ] ) , including top decay , may be obtained as well as fortran code from the program madgraph @xcite , we believe that our analytical results are valuable for a number of reasons .",
    "first , analytical expressions can offer additional insights , e.g. in the phase space structure of the cross section near the top mass pole .",
    "second , they lead to even more compact computer codes by allowing numerical crossing , and third , they allow evaluation in terms of spinor products , and in different computer languages ( we use c++ ) . finally , our results constitute a nontrivial check on this useful program . in this context",
    "we also mention the program onetop @xcite , and the general purpose programs pythia @xcite and herwig @xcite which can be used as event generators for single top production .    in order to test these amplitudes numerically , we study various distributions in momentum and angle of some of the final state particles for each process separately .",
    "we limit ourselves here to the subprocesses ( [ production1]-[production3 ] ) , because process ( [ production4 ] ) is negligible @xcite at the tevatron .",
    "we note that whether a subprocess is a leading order contribution or a higher order correction to another , depends on the definition of the final state .",
    "thus , for sufficiently inclusive quantities the w - gluon fusion and flavor excitation processes are not independent : a part of the former is then in fact a higher order qcd correction to the latter , and must be mass factorized @xcite .",
    "a similar argument applies to w - gluon fusion and the @xmath1-channel process in the case where the gluon couples to the @xmath17-@xmath18-quark line , and the signal is defined to be inclusive with respect to the presence of the light quark jet .",
    "furthermore , whether bottom quarks are part of the initial state is a choice of factorization scheme .",
    "we adopt a five - flavor scheme and include bottom quark parton distribution functions . in this paper",
    "we wish to examine some characteristics of each process individually , rather than perform a comprehensive phenomenological study involving combinations of these processes and their backgrounds , as such studies already exists in the literature @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus on exclusive quantities , e.g. we require exactly three jets or exactly two jets .",
    "our conventions for spinor helicity methods are listed in section 2 .",
    "sections 3 and 4 , together with appendices a and b , contain the helicity amplitudes for processes ( [ amp1 ] ) and ( [ amp2 ] ) . in section 5",
    "we discuss the narrow top width approximation , while the results of our numerical studies can be found in section 6 .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "to compute the amplitudes for ( [ amp1 ] ) and ( [ amp2 ] ) we use spinor helicity methods @xcite - @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves here to listing our conventions , for reviews of spinor helicity methods see e.g. @xcite .    with spinor helicity methods we can express scattering amplitudes in terms of massless weyl spinors of helicity @xmath19 @xmath20 external fermion states",

    "even though helicity is not a conserved quantum number for a massive particle , a massive positive - energy spinor satisfying the dirac equation has a two - fold degeneracy ( e.g. labelled by a spin - component quantized along some axis ) .",

    "we suggest that this clear correlation may provide an alternative and attractive way to infer the visible w - gluon fusion or flavor excitation cross section ( defined here through the criteria given above ) for single - top production from the slope of the distribution .",
    "the slope is given by @xmath172 assuming that @xmath173 is small and that @xmath174 may reliable be estimated from theory the visible cross section for the signal can be inferred from the slope by measuring two or more points of the @xmath171 distribution and extrapolating the distribution to a straight line .",
    "although in principle of course any distribution may serve to infer the corresponding inclusive cross section , the @xmath171 distribution seems particularly attractive due to its simple shape .",
    "we have presented the complete @xmath90 and @xmath46 helicity amplitudes for processes whose final state results from the hadroproduction and semileptonic decay of a single top .    as only a small subset of graphs",
    "actually contain a top quark line in each process , we have examined , for three of these processes , to what extent the top quark dominates , and verified that for each process the top quark presence is manifested by a clear peak in the @xmath160 distribution .",
    "we have studied various kinematic distribution of final state particles , and verified the correlation of the lepton angular distribution with the top quark polarization @xcite .",
    "the actual identification of a single top signal is a matter of careful definition , requiring full use of the kinematic and flavor characteristics of the final state , and a proper determination of the acceptance and background @xcite . in an idealized analyses ,",
    "we have thus verified that the sensitivity of the full amplitudes to top quark mass , charged - current coupling strength and handedness are preserved in these amplitudes , even though most diagrams that contribute to them do not contain a top quark .",
