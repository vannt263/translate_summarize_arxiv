    "polymers have been proposed@xcite as an alternative materials for providing mechanical flexibility and stability at relatively low cost for myriad energy applications .",
    "such application include lithium batteries@xcite , organic photovoltaics@xcite , and supercapacitors@xcite",
    ". however , there is considerable scope when it comes to designing and synthesizing efficient polymer materials for energy applications despite a plethora of research both by the experimental and theoretical community .    a fundamental understanding of how polymer chains pack in the melts is of paramount importance for the development of a molecular description of the transport@xcite of electrolytes through the polymer matrix . structure - property concepts such as fragility@xcite demands a systematic study of the chain packing effects and the free - volume distribution@xcite in polymeric melts . in general , the chain packing depends on the architecture of the polymers and several other experimental variables affecting crystallinity of the materials .",
    "however , in the amorphous state , two key experimental variables are the temperature and the backbone rigidity , which clearly affect the performance of different polymeric materials in devices@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we have studied the effects of temperature and backbone rigidity on the packing of chains in amorphous melts using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "the simulation method is presented in section  [ sec : method ] followed by the results and conclusions in sections  [ sec : results ] and  [ sec : conclusions ] , respectively .",
    "we have used the large - scale atomic / molecular massively parallel simulator@xcite ( lammps ) for carrying out the brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations for the polymer melts .",
    "the polymer chains are modeled by a coarse - grained model ( known as kremer - grest bead - spring model@xcite ) . in particular , the langevin equation is integrated , given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the mass and the friction coefficient for the beads .",
    "@xmath2 is the pairwise interaction potential and is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the truncated and shifted lennard - jones potential , which is purely _",

    "explicitly , @xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 ,   & \\mbox{$r_{ij } \\leq r_c$}\\\\          \\infty , & \\mbox{$r_{ij }   \\geq r_c$}.\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] so that @xmath8 is the maximum extent of a bond . here , we have used the notation @xmath9 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have chosen @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the parameter used to quantify time steps .",
    "results presented in this paper were obtained by carrying out the simulations in dimensionless units so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( used in @xmath4 replacing @xmath14 ) so that explicit values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are needed to switch from dimensionless units to the real units .    in this work , we present results for polymer melts corresponding to a number density of monomers @xmath17 , which corresponds to @xmath18 particles in a cubic box of edge length @xmath19 .",
    "the simulations are performed by using periodic boundary conditions for two sets of chains : freely jointed chains and the chains with fixed angles between adjacent bonds . for the chains with fixed bond angles ,",
    "we have used the _ harmonic _ angular potential to constrain the angle between adjacent bonds .",
    "explicitly , the angular potential used in this work is written as @xmath20 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] simulation results presented here were obtained by choosing @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( in radians ) , which corresponds to a bond angle of @xmath23 degrees .",
    "polymer chains with @xmath24 beads are studied at five temperatures @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , all the simulations are carried out in the nvt ensemble so that the number density stays the same during the simulation runs . in other words ,",
    "the effects of thermal expansion and the change in the number density with the change in temperature are not considered here .",
    "all the simulations were started from random configurations of the chains followed by a slow push - off set - up run for one million time steps as described in ref .",
    "@xcite before moving on to the runs with the interaction potentials described above .    to quantify the chain packing ,",
    "we have carried out a voronoi analysis@xcite for the polymeric melts after fifty million time steps ( in units of @xmath27 ) .",
    "the voronoi construction is carried out using the c++ library , voro++ .",
    "the results presented here are the averages of one thousand configurations spanning 1 million time steps , and we have carefully ensured that the results are independent of subsequent runs . furthermore , the md simualtions have been carried out by using @xmath28 cores on the supercomputer , jaguar , followed by the voronoi analysis on the data analysis cluster , lens .",
    "a snapshot of the polymer chains in the simulation box is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : snapshots ] along with the voronoi construction for a single chain in a cubic box .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshots](b ) that the shape and volume of the voronoi polyhedra are highly sensitive to the conformations of the chain . in the case of the melts ,",
    "the conformational degrees of freedom of the chains depends on the intra- and interchain interactions in a complicated manner .",
    "the bd simulation procedure described above allows us to study the effect of these interactions on the distribution of the voronoi polyhedra in the melts and quantify the chain packing .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : voro_compare ] , we present the histograms for the distribution of the voronoi polyhedra in the melts containing the freely jointed chains and the chains with the fixed bond angles at different temperatures . these results , obtained for a fixed volume of the simulation box , clearly show that the temperature affects the distribution of the voronoi polyhedra in a significant manner . at higher temperatures corresponding to @xmath29 , there are two sets of populations for both the freely jointed chains and the chains with the fixed bond angles . for a number density of @xmath30 ,",
    "the average volume per particle is @xmath31 ( in units of @xmath32 ) .",
    "indeed a clear peak at the polyhedra volume of @xmath33 is seen at all the temperatures with a finite width .",
    "an additional peak at higher volumes is observed and is found to correspond to the chain ends .",
    "higher voronoi polyhedra volume associated with the chain ends has been reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "however , at lower temperatures ( e.g. , at @xmath34 ) there are significant differences in the distibution of the voronoi polyhedra , when the case of the freely jointed chains is compared with the chains with fixed bond angle . in the case of the chains with fixed bond angles , which correspond to relatively rigid chains ,",
    "the distribution is wider in comparison with the freely jointed chains .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that polymer backbone rigidity affects the distribution of the free - volume in the polymeric melts , especially at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the fully flexible chains such as in peo , rigid chains have a wider distribution of the free - volume at lower temperatures . with the assumption that the distibution of the free - volume affects@xcite the transport of electrolytes , these results are important for an efficient design of polymeric materials intended for use in energy applications . in the case of organic photovoltaics , conjugated polymers ( i.e. , polymers with rigid backbones ) are already used@xcite .",
    "however , flexible macromolecules such as peo are used for battery applications and show lower@xcite ionic conductivity for room - temperature applications .",
    "a wider distribution of the free - volume at lower temperatures is indeed necessary for the materials to conduct . keeping this in mind ,",
    "our results show that the polymeric materials with rigid backbone needs to be used for low - temperature applications , in contrast to the widely used approach of peo - based materials .",
    "also , we point out that this relatively newer idea of using rigid chains for battery applications conforms to some recently published experimental results@xcite .",
