    "during the last decade an impressive progress in the search for the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron ( _ e_edm ) has been achieved @xcite .",
    "the great interest in _",

    "also , magnetic moment ( g - factor ) of the @xmath1 electron state is very small ( zero in the nonrelativistic limit ) , and this is another reason for reducing the systematic errors .",
    "the advantage of using such a state has been demonstrated in the recent experiment on tho molecule @xcite .    the working @xmath1 state of tho is a metastable ( first excited ) one with the lifetime of about 2  ms @xcite whereas the ground state is @xmath15 .",

    "( [ wtp],[wm],[apar ] ) .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ wd])([apar ] ) that the action of operators related to the @xmath17 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath51 characteristics is heavily concentrated in the atomic core region . on the other hand",
    "the leading contribution to the corresponding matrix elements ( mean values ) is due to the valence electrons since contributions from the inert ( usually closed and spherically symmetric ) inner - core shells compensate each other or negligible in most cases of practical interest for the operators , in particular , dependent on the total angular momentum and spin .",
    "note , however , that the spin - polarization of core ( sub - valence or outer - core ) shells induced by the valence unpaired electrons can provide a comparable contribution by magnitude to such properties as that from the valence electrons , e.g. , see refs .",
    "below we shall call such properties as the `` core properties '' ( or , more generally , `` core characteristics '' since not only measurable properties but other effective hamiltonian parameters which are not always measurable can be considered here ) assuming that the main contribution to them comes from the spatially - localized core region rather than from core shells .",
    "some of well - known examples of such property are the magnetic dipole hyperfine constants ( see eq .",
    "[ apar ] ) . in the cases of unpaired @xmath61-electrons ,",
    "the leading contribution to the hyperfine structure is determined by the fermi - contact interaction ( in nonrelativistic case ) which is proportional to the electronic spin density directly on the nucleus .",
    "other examples of core properties ( which have negligible contribution from inert inner - most core shells ) are the chemical shifts of x - ray emission spectra @xcite , etc",
    ".    one can safely exclude inactive inner - core electrons from correlation calculation due to their negligible contribution to the core properties . in the present consideration ,",
    "the inner - core consists of @xmath62 electrons of th .",
    "as th is a very heavy element ( atomic number is 90 ) the interaction of electrons with the th nucleus should be treated by a fully relativistic manner for a good accuracy . moreover , for some properties even taking account of breit interaction ( mainly between valence and core electrons of th , see @xcite ) can be important . with a good accuracy for the properties considered here ,",
    "the inner - core electrons differ negligibly in the cases of atomic th and thf@xmath0 cation because their wavefunctions mostly defined by the strong th nucleus potential @xmath63 screened by inner - more electrons , so that the effective th core field is much stronger than the energetics of valence ( chemically active ) electrons . in the correlation calculation",
    "they can be frozen without a loss of the accuracy accessible presently . a common way to exclude inner - core electrons",
    "is to use the relativistic effective core potential method .",
    "earlier our group has developed the generalized relativistic effective core potential ( grecp ) version which permits one to attain a very high accuracy @xcite .",
    "this effective potential emulates interaction between inner - core electrons ( excluded explicitly from grecp calculations ) and valence plus outer - core electrons ( treated explicitly with grecp ) .",
    "performing electronic structure calculation one can evaluate different valence properties such as transition energies between low - lying states , molecule - frame dipole moments , etc .",
    "however , since the inner - core parts of the valence one - electron `` pseudo - wavefunctions '' are smoothed in the grecp calculations , they have to be recovered with some core - restoration method before using them to evaluate the core characteristics considered above . in series of papers a non - variational restoration concept ( and its initial implementation , see @xcite and references ) , which is based on a proportionality of valence and low - lying virtual spinors in the inner - core region of heavy atoms was developed ( see @xcite and the next section ) .",
    "recently we have developed a new implementation of the concept which permits to use well - developed codes on correlation treatment such as dirac @xcite , mrcc @xcite and cfour @xcite @xcite .",
    "below we give description of the new implementation ; now the code is also extended to characterize effective states ( configurations ) of atoms in compounds , e.g. th in the thf@xmath0 and tho .",
    "using the basic idea of the nonvariational restoration method one generates _",
    "equivalent _ basis sets of one - center four - component spinors @xmath64 and smoothed two - component pseudospinors @xmath65 in all - electron finite - difference dirac - fock - breit and grecp / self - consistent field calculations ( employing the @xmath66coupling scheme ) of _ the same _ configurations of a considered atom and its ions @xcite . here",
    "@xmath67 is the principal quantum number , @xmath68 is the total electronic momentum , @xmath69 is its projection and @xmath70 is the orbital momentum . in the newly developed procedure a basis set of real spin - orbitals ( and not complex spin - orbit - mixed spinors ) @xmath71 is generated additionally .",
    "the spin - orbitals @xmath71 are then expanded in the basis set of one - center two - component atomic pseudospinors @xmath72    the atomic two - component pseudospinors are replaced by equivalent four - component spinors while the expansion coefficients from eq .",

    "is evaluated after the ( g)recp calculation of a molecule or some condensed - matter system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details on the condensed - matter case ) one can then reexpand it in the basis of one - center @xmath71 functions on an atom of interest .",
    "this mapping from a multi - center basis @xmath77 to the one - center basis @xmath78 corresponds to a similarity transformation of the density matrix : @xmath79 where @xmath80 are elements of the density matrix in the basis of @xmath71 functions . due to `` equivalence '' of @xmath71 and @xmath74 functions ( see eqs .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) and ( [ restoration ] ) ) based on appropriate properties of the hard - core shape - consistent ( g)recp versions @xcite , one can write : @xmath81 where @xmath82 are elements of the density matrix in the basis of four - component @xmath74 functions  ( [ restoration ] ) .",
    "thus , as an approximation we can equate the @xmath82 elements to @xmath80 and interpret it as a restoration of `` true '' four - component structure of density matrix that is important first of all for the inner - core region .",
    "the mean value of some one - electron operator @xmath83 corresponding to a core property on a given atom can be evaluated as follows : @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the matrix elements of operator @xmath83 in the basis of four - component functions @xmath74  ( [ restoration ] ) .    in the current implementation of restoration procedure the functions",
    "@xmath71 are real spin - orbitals with the spatial factor in the form of contracted gaussians , for which reexpansion ( [ transf1 ] ) is performed analytically .",
    "therefore , significant acceleration is attained in contrast to the original restoration procedure @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the four - component functions used to evaluate matrix elements of operator @xmath83 are taken in numerical ( finite - difference ) form .",
    "this permits to exclude some complications in reproducing accurate wavefunction behavior in a region near nucleus which can arise when gauss - type functions are used there .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we have introduced a concept of _ atoms in compounds _ ( aic ) and applied it to the problem of chemical shifts of x - ray emission lines .",
    "the concept assumes that for the core characteristics one can determine an effective state of a given atom in a chemical compound , for which the mean values of operators corresponding to _ all _ the considered core characteristics , have near the same magnitudes for the case of an atom bonded in a molecule and for the same atom in the considered effective state .",
    "note , that the concept can not be directly applied to evaluation of the `` valence '' properties ( again , taking in mind spatial localization rather than affiliation to valence shells ) such as the molecule - frame dipole moment , g - factor , etc .",
    "let us show how the aic theory can be formulated in context of the problems discussed in this paper .",
    "assume that we have obtained a one - electron density matrix from calculation of an atom , molecule or crystal ( in the direct lattice ) .",
    "the density matrix can be formally reexpanded on one center , i.e. , on a heavy atom of interest : @xmath86 in a sufficiently complete basis set of orthonormal atomic functions @xmath87 .",
    "then for the mean value of some one - electron operator @xmath83 we have : @xmath88 the mean value in eq .",

    "( [ matrfull ] ) have to be negligible compared to the first term . as an extremal case , @xmath92 for the fermi - contact interactions .",
    "thus , for a core - property operator we have @xmath93    now we assume that the basis set @xmath87 was constructed after calculations of the atom or its low - charged ions .",
    "the basis set contains inner core spinors , marked below by index `` c '' ( which are occupied by the inert electrons and excluded from molecular calculations with grecp as inactive , completely occupied states ) ; valence , outer core ( occupied by explicitly treated core electrons ) and low - lying virtual spinors ; all together they are marked by index `` w '' .",
    "the rest spinors , corresponding to high - energy virtual states , are marked by index `` r '' .",
    "the core states are only negligibly changed in the low - energy process under consideration ( formation of chemical bond , low - energy excitation of atom , etc . ) .",
    "the completeness condition for the @xmath87 basis can be formally written as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the projector on the inner - core spinors , @xmath96 is the projector on the outer - core , valence and low - energy virtual spinors , and @xmath97 is the projection on the other ( high - energy ) states . for low - energy processes , which include chemical bonding , low - lying excitations and those induced by weak external fields , one can usually neglect the high - energy states to study the properties of interest : @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 . here",
    "we have taken into account that the inner - core electrons need not be usually correlated to preserve high accuracy for the core properties in general , in contrast to the w - states .",

    "in other cases @xmath107 can be obtained from atomic calculation if one takes into account that the heavy - atom inner - core electrons are inactive in low - energy processes .",
