    "measuring the masses of celestial objects is one of the principal challenges in astrophysics .",
    "the primary method used to accomplish this task involves considering orbital motion .",
    "this standard method has been applied to a number of x - ray binaries with the result showing that the mass function exceeds the maximal mass of a neutron star ( ns ) , i.e. , @xmath11 , which points to the fact that there are systems containing black holes ( bh ) .",
    "there are also indirect ways of measuring black hole masses .",
    "the measurement of x - ray luminosity leads to a lower limit on the mass of the accreting body arising from the eddington limit .",
    "this method , which was applied in the case of ultra luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) has hinted that these systems are bhs with masses in excess of @xmath12 ( miller et al .",
    "this claim is subject to a number of assumptions , such as the isotropy of radiation ( e.g. , king 2009 ) .",
    "additionally , it was implied that bhs with mass smaller than @xmath8 can explain all , but the most luminous , ulxs ( for most recent studies see zampieri & roberts 2009 ; kajava & poutanen 2009 ; gladstone , roberts & done 2009 ; mapelli et al .",
    "nevertheless , there is a growing sample of stellar mass black holes with masses confirmed by observations of orbital binary motion , for a discussion see pakull & mirioni ( 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , there are some solitary bh candidates which have been detected through microlensing experiments , and there are good prospects for observing more of such objects .",
    "a review of the observations of galactic bh candidates ( orosz 2003 ; casares 2007 ; ziolkowski 2008 ) shows that the masses of stellar bhs range from a few solar masses to about @xmath13 ( greiner , cuby & mccaughrean 2001 ) , in the case of grs 1915 - 105 , and @xmath14 for cyg x-1 ( gies & bolton 1986 ) .",
    "however , in case of cyg x-1 the estimates by different authors vary from @xmath15 ( herrero et al .",
    "1995 ) to @xmath16 ( ziolkowski 2005 ) .",
    "the development of experimental techniques in recent years has allowed for the investigation of x - ray binaries in neighboring galaxies .",
    "this has led to the discovery of the largest stellar mass black hole in the binary ic10 x-1 .",
    "the mass of the bh was found in the range of @xmath17 ( prestwich et al .",
    "2007 ; silverman & filippenko 2008 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the star formation rate in dwarf galaxy ic10 is very high , and its metallicity is low @xmath18 ( massey et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the spectrum of black hole masses is extremely interesting from the point of view of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "the interferometric observatories like ligo ( abramovici et al . 1992 ) and virgo ( bradaschia et al . 1990 ) can detect coalescences of @xmath15 bh binaries at a distance of @xmath19mpc , and the sensitivity of the detectors will soon increase .",
    "thus , the theoretical understanding of the distribution of masses of black holes formed by stars may soon be measurable with gravitational wave observations , and vice versa ; knowledge of the bh mass spectrum may help to identify the parameter space which favors a high probability of source detection .",
    "formation of bhs in the course of stellar evolution is connected with the end of the nuclear burning phase in a massive star . for the lower mass end of bh formation",
    ", a meta - stable protoneutron star may be formed , and the black hole appears after accretion of the part of the stellar envelope that could not be expelled in the supernova explosion . in the case of the most massive stars",
    "the bh is formed through accretion of the entire stellar material ( direct collapse or failed supernova ) .",
    "thus the mass of the bh is determined mainly by the mass of the star at the moment the collapse takes place , as well as the explosion energy ( e.g. , fryer 1999 ) .",
    "the presupernova mass is set predominantly by the amount of mass loss during stellar evolution .",
    "the mass loss for massive stars is due to stellar winds ( single stars ; e.g. , vink 2008 ) and additionally close interactions for stars that are found in multiple systems ( e.g. , binary stars ; hurley , tout & pols 2002 ) .",
    "knowledge of the mass - loss rates for bh progenitors such as wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars  massive stars found near the main - sequence ( ms ) losing mass at high rates and showing weak , or no , hydrogen lines in their spectra  and luminous blue variables ( lbvs )  extremely massive post - ms objects in a stage of evolution prior to becoming wr stars  is therefore important for understanding bh masses .",
    "a subset of wr stars ( those with no hydrogen lines ) are the naked helium stars which can also be formed from less massive stars that lose their hydrogen envelopes on the giant branch or beyond .",
    "in this paper we review the recent results on modeling the stellar winds with a special emphasis on the metallicity dependence of these winds .",
    "this is a proof of principle study as we consider only the simplest case : that of single stellar evolution .",
    "we neglect the effects of binary interactions ( e.g. , mass loss / gain due to a close companion ) and calculate the bh mass spectrum for single stars only .",
    "we combine the wind mass loss rates with the stellar evolution models and investigate the initial - remnant mass relation of stars for different metallicities .",
    "in particular , we calculate the maximum black hole mass for various models .",
    "the description of the wind mass loss rates and evolutionary model is presented in section  2 , ",
    "3 contains the results of our calculations , and we summarize our findings in  4 .",
    "for our study we employ the single star evolutionary formulae of hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) that are used within the startrack population synthesis code ( belczynski , kalogera & bulik 2002 ; belczynski et al .",
    "updates to the hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) formulae in startrack include an improved prescription for final remnant masses ( see below ) and the modeling of electron - capture supernovae where electrons are captured onto mg atoms in an o - ne - mg stellar core leading to collapse to a ns ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2004 ) , thus extending the range of stellar masses that produce nss ( at the low - mass end ) .",
    "we also note that hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) fitted their stellar evolution formulae to detailed models of stellar masses of @xmath20 or less and we extend this to include stars up to @xmath21  the predicted maximum stellar mass for star formation under usual conditions ( weidner & kroupa 2004 ) .",
    "however , the formulae are well - behaved within this extrapolation . stars more massive than @xmath21 which are now being considered as possible progenitors of intermediate - mass bhs in dense star clusters are not considered ( see glebbeek et al .",
    "2009 for an overview ) .",
    "the employed single star evolutionary formulae were obtained for stellar models without mass loss .",
    "the formulae include the effects of mass gain ( and potential rejuvenation ) and mass loss on a star .",
    "change of star mass may lead ( e.g. for main sequence stars ) to change of star central temperature and pressure , that affects the rate of nuclear reactions and a star lifetime .",
    "this leads also to the change of external star properties like its luminosity and radius .",
    "there is a feedback running from adopted wind mass loss rate ( that depends on star properties ; mass , luminosity and radius ) to the star ( mass loss affects star mass and thus its radius and luminosity ) and then back to the wind mass loss rate .",
    "this setup allows for employment of different wind mass loss rate prescriptions with the same set of underlying stellar models .",
    "the scheme that is used in our calculations is described in detail by tout et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and hurley et al .",
    "this scheme is only an approximation in the mass loss / gain treatment , and detailed stellar evolutionary calculations ( e.g. , timmes , woosley & weaver 1996 ; limongi & chieffi 2006 ) with the specific set of winds could be , in principle , used to obtain the more accurate results .",
    "however , it is noted that both stellar models ( e.g. , mixing or reaction rates ; cassisi 2009 ) and wind mass loss rates ( e.g. , clumping or lbv phase ; vink 2008 ) are burdened with a number of uncertainties , rendering any estimate of a black hole mass a subject to large systematic errors .    for stellar winds we use both the prescriptions given originally by hurley et al .",

    "we note that the above winds apply to stars that are more massive than @xmath56 ( spectral type earlier than b8 - 7 ) as these stars have @xmath57 at the zero age main sequence .    for luminous blue variable stars that are evolved ( beyond the main sequence ) , h - rich and extremely luminous ( @xmath43 and @xmath58 ; humphreys & davidson 1994 ) we adopt @xmath59 with the standard choice for a calibration factor @xmath60 ( see  3.3 for justification ) .",
    "this formula is assumed to give the full amount of lbv mass loss ( unlike in the previous prescription in which lbv winds were added on top of the underlying massive star winds :  2.1 ) .",
    "we note that this formula accounts both for lbv stellar wind mass loss as well as possible lbv shell ejections .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that lbv mass loss is independent of metallicity ( see  3.3 for further discussion ) .    for wolf - rayet ( naked helium ) stars we adopt @xmath61 which is a combination of the hamann & koesterke ( 1998 ) wind rate estimate that takes into account wr wind clumping ( reduced winds ) , and vink & de koter ( 2005 ) wind @xmath30-dependence who estimated @xmath62 for wr stars .",
    "for h - rich low mass stars , for which the above prescriptions do not apply , we use hurley et al .",

    "we use hydrodynamical calculations of supernovae explosions to estimate the amount of fall back that may occur during core collapse of the most massive stars ( e.g. , fryer 1999 ; fryer & kalogera 2001 ) .",
    "finally , to change baryonic mass to gravitational mass of a remnant we use a prescription proposed by lattimer & yahil ( 1989 ) for neutron stars , and for black holes we assume that the gravitational mass is @xmath63 of the baryonic mass .    our prescriptions for the iron core mass , fallback mass and final remnant mass are given in full detail in belczynski et al .",

    "core masses above 7.6@xmath64 , we assume the star collapses directly to a black hole and its final mass is equal to the star s total mass at collapse . in between these two extremes , we use a linear fit between no fallback onto the iron core and complete fallback .",
    "this fallback prescription is based on the explosion models from fryer ( 1999 ) and is in agreement with fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) .",
    "we can compare this prescription directly to the latest analytic study of remnant masses by fryer et al .",

    "the differences between our prescription and the fryer et al . semi",
    "- analytic estimates are well within the errors in current detailed stellar evolutionary models and collapse simulations .",
    "the final black hole mass is primarily set by the mass of the star at collapse ( our most massive remnants are produced in stars that collapse directly to a black hole ) .",
    "differences in the pre - collapse star mass account for the bulk of the remnant mass differences between stellar models by different groups .",
    "these differences are primarily driven by different wind prescriptions .",
    "the most massive remnants are formed through direct collapse where the entire ( or nearly entire ) presupernova star ends up under the event horizon , contributing to the black hole mass . in those cases ,",
    "the explosion energy is too low to overcome the gravitational potential of an exploding star . for example",
    ", a galactic ( @xmath66 ) massive star with an initial mass of @xmath67 is found at presupernova stage as a wr star with a mass of @xmath68 and a co core mass of @xmath69 and this star forms a black hole with mass of @xmath70 .",
    "the lower masses in the above example correspond to the hurley et al . winds (  2.1 ) and the higher masses to the new adopted set of winds (  2.2 ) . in both cases the presupernova star was massive enough to form a black hole through direct collapse .    as we will show in the next sections ,",
    "the change of stellar wind prescriptions does not affect the compact object remnant masses for stars with initial mass @xmath71 ( i.e. , stars that form neutron stars , and low mass black holes ) .",
    "for the highest mass stars , the new wind prescription results in more massive presupernova objects and heavier black holes .",
    "although the details of supernova calculations are still rather uncertain , relevant studies ( e.g. , fryer 1999 ) indicate that stars with very high initial masses @xmath72 form black holes through direct collapse or at least with significant fall back ( i.e. , most of presupernova mass ends up in the black hole ) .",
    "therefore , the maximum mass of a black hole , which is the main subject of this study , will predominantly depend only on _",
    "( i ) _ the employed stellar models and _ ( ii ) _ the adopted set of stellar winds , both which set presupernova mass .",
    "here we describe the predictions for the new adopted wind mass loss rates and we compare them with the previously employed prescription .",

    "we present the initial - remnant mass relation for three different metallicities ; @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath73 .",
    "the initial - remnant mass relation shows the compact object remnant mass ( @xmath74 : either neutron star or a black hole ) for a given initial ( @xmath75 : at zero age main sequence ) star mass .    for high ( galaxy - like ; @xmath1 ) metallicity",
    ", neutron star formation begins at @xmath76 with low mass nss ( @xmath77 ) formed through electron capture supernovae ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2004 ) , while for higher initial masses ( over @xmath78 ; see tab .",
    "[ relation1 ] ) nss form through regular core collapse . in a rather wide range",
    "@xmath79 nss are formed with @xmath80 , then for @xmath81 nss are formed with @xmath82 .",
    "there is a bimodal final feni core mass distribution due to the mode of co burning  convective or radiative  prior to core - collapse ; timmes et al .",
    "the latest results from the kepler code do not show these same bimodal effect on the feni core mass , so this effect may not be real ( zhang et al .",
    "the detailed study of an alternative neutron star formation mass is underway ( fryer & belczynski , in preparation ) , we just note that the details of neutron star formation do not play crucial role in conclusions derived in this study . for @xmath83 ,",
    "fall back is expected to occur and this rapidly increases the mass of the remnant .",
    "depending on the adopted limit for maximum ns mass ( @xmath84 ) , black hole formation starts at @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) or at @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "note that the ns / bh transition is almost insensitive to the value adopted for the maximum ns mass as the initial - remnant mass relation rises very steeply for the relevant remnant masses ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the steepness of the relation is due to the increasing contribution of fall back in the final mass of the remnant .    for lower metallicities ,",
    "the general features of the initial - remnant mass relation for neutron stars are very similar to the ones described above , with a natural downward shift of initial masses , since lower metallicity stars lose less mass in winds . in particular , for very metal - poor environments ( globular cluster - like ; @xmath90 ) ns formation starts at @xmath91 and the transition to bh formation is found at @xmath92 .",
    "additionally , we note that whether we use the old or new wind prescription , the initial - remnant mass relation is virtually unaffected for neutron stars .",
    "we therefore note that the wind mass loss rates presented by hurley et al.(2000 ) do not differ significantly from the o / b winds presented by vink et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for neutron star progenitors ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "we can derive such a conclusion since in the considered mass range , lbv and wr - like winds do not operate .    for black holes various features of the initial - remnant mass relation change significantly with metallicity , and",
    "additionally the relation is different for the two sets of winds used . for @xmath1",
    "the relation rises steeply for @xmath94 , and at the high end of this range there is a small dip after which the relation resumes its rise but at a slower rate .",
    "this dip ( a wr dip ) corresponds to the onset of helium star winds ; the threshold mass for removing the entire h - rich envelope is found at @xmath95 and above this mass the stars are subject to strong wr winds . at @xmath96",
    "we observe the onset of very strong lbv mass loss , and as the rates differ between old and new winds , the final - initial mass relations look different above the lbv formation threshold . for the old rates ,",
    "stronger lbv winds first lead to a decrease ( a lbv dip ) and then a rather slow increase of bh mass with the initial star mass . for the new winds , the lbv winds are not as strong , and instead of a lbv dip there is only a flattening - out at @xmath97 and",
    "then the bh mass slowly increases with initial mass .",
    "the difference in relative strength of lbv winds leads to noticeable ( although not very drastic ) differences in black hole mass for the two models . stars with @xmath98 form @xmath99 bhs in old models ( high lbv mass loss )",
    ", while they form @xmath100 bhs in new models ( moderate lbv mass loss ) .",
    "note that at solar metallicity wr winds are the same for both models .    for @xmath101 , bh",
    "masses are larger than in the case of solar metallicity , as here winds are lower for smaller @xmath30 so there is a larger mass reservoir at the time of bh formation .",
    "there are also significant qualitative differences in the shape of the relation .",
    "an lbv dip occurs for low initial mass ( @xmath102 ) , and in particular for old winds it is found even before the onset of the wr transition / dip ( @xmath103 ) , while for new winds it is found almost at the exact same place as the wr dip ( @xmath104 ; see table 1 ) .",
    "the shift of the onset of wr - like winds corresponds to decreasing mass loss with decreasing @xmath30 ; therefore a higher initial stellar mass is required to form a naked helium star . since at this @xmath30 stars",
    "do not lose so much mass , they are more luminous and therefore they can reach the lbv phase at lower initial masses , so the lbv formation threshold moves the opposite way : to lower masses .",
    "for high initial masses , the bh mass becomes significantly different for the two employed models .",
    "in particular , for the old set of winds , stars with @xmath105 and with @xmath106 form the most massive bhs : @xmath100 . with the new winds , stars with @xmath106 form maximum mass bhs : @xmath107 . this increasing difference in @xmath108",
    "is due mostly to the dependence of wr winds on metallicity .",
    "for old winds , wr winds are assumed to be independent of @xmath30 and therefore the increase in maximum bh mass is rather moderate . with the new prescription ,",
    "wr winds are lower for lower @xmath30 and we note a rather significant increase in maximum bh mass .",
    "to give an example , a star with an initial mass of @xmath109 loses @xmath110 and @xmath111 in wr winds for the new and old prescriptions , respectively ( more examples in  3.2 ) .    for @xmath90",

    "this point stars are sufficiently massive that the o / b winds and lbv winds are not strong enough to remove the entire h - rich envelope ; so stars never become naked helium stars and are not subjected to strong wr winds .",

    "this means that the black hole mass currently observed in cyg x-1 is close to its formation mass .",
    "this must be true if the prior evolutionary history of cyg x-1 does not include mass transfer via rlof , and the only mass transfer proceeded through stellar winds from the companion ( e.g. , ziolkowski 2005 ) .",
    "mass transfer via rlof onto the bh in cyg x-1 was considered by podsiadlowski et al .",
    "it was concluded that if such a phase actually occurred , the black hole mass remained basically unchanged due to the fact that rlof was proceeding on a very fast ( thermal ) timescale which is set by the massive companion , and most of the transferred mass was eventually lost from the system .",
    "the most massive known extragalactic black hole ( @xmath205 ) is in a binary system ic10 x-1 with a massive wr star companion : @xmath206 with a mass at the high end of this range being the most likely case ( silverman & filippenko 2008 ) .",
    "the wr star is well within its roche lobe and the wind mass loss rate was estimated to be at the level of @xmath207 ( clark & crowther 2004 ) . due to the short lifetime of such a massive wr star ( @xmath208 myr ; e.g. , bulik , belczynski & prestwich 2009 ) , and since only a fraction of wind mass can be captured by the black hole , the increase in black hole mass due to wind accretion can not exceed a few solar masses .",
    "past evolution of this system has not yet been studied in detail and we can not exclude the possibility that there was a phase with rlof mass transfer from the unevolved companion ( before it became a wr star ) .",
    "such a mass transfer episode may have , in principle , significantly increased the black hole mass , and a thorough investigation of possible initial configurations of this system in conjunction with evolutionary calculations will be needed to clarify this issue ( valsecchi et al . , in preparation ) .    in conclusion",
    ", it appears that the mass we have used to calibrate the maximum black hole mass for single star evolution in a galactic - like environment ( high metallicity ; @xmath66 ) : @xmath168 is consistent with the formation mass of cyg x-1 , which hosts one of the most massive bhs known in the galaxy .",
    "with such a method , calibrated using the most recent metallicity - dependent wind mass loss rates , we predict that the maximum black hole mass ( attained via single stellar evolution ) is @xmath209 for an environment of moderate metallicity , like that of the ic10 galaxy ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "our prediction is rather striking as the mass of the most massive known bh  that which resides in ic10 in binary x-1  is @xmath211 .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that the bh in ic10 x-1 has accreted a significant amount of mass from its binary companion .",
    "we also note that if our calibration of lbv winds is slightly modified ( decreased ) to @xmath179 , then we predict black holes ( single stellar evolution ) to form with masses up to @xmath212 for @xmath66 ( the galaxy ) , @xmath171 ( ic10 ) and @xmath213 ( globular clusters ) , respectively ( see fig .",

    "in fact , our primary objective was to check whether within a given set of stellar evolutionary models and for available wind mass loss predictions , stars can form black holes that are as massive as those observed in our galaxy ( @xmath214 for grs 1915 and @xmath215 for cyg x-1 ) and in external galaxies ( @xmath216 for ic10 x-1 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that for solar metallicity environments ( like our galaxy ) , both sets of winds - the previously employed ( hurley et al . ) and the newly adopted ( vink et al . ) - provide remnants massive enough to explain known galactic black holes . however , the predictions are quite different for intermediate and low metallicities . in summary ,",
    "hurley et al .",
    "winds remove too much mass from stars and within these models one does not expect the formation of black holes more massive than @xmath217 even at very low metallicities .",
    "this is due to the combined effects of lack of metallicity dependence for wr winds and the rather strong lbv winds adopted in the hurley et al .",

    "our new results bring the remnant mass predictions of startrack more in line with the predictions of fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) and heger et al .",

    "the fact that the maximum black hole mass increases with metallicity due to metal - dependent winds was recently investigated by stellar evolution computations with metallicity - dependent main sequence and wolf - rayet mass loss by eldridge & vink ( 2006 ) where it was found that in lower metallicity galaxies black holes are expected to have larger masses .",
    "our results agree and to quantify them we provide an approximate formula for the maximum black hole mass : + @xmath220 + @xmath221 where the black hole mass is expressed in [ @xmath222 and the relation holds true for our newly adopted set of stellar winds ( vink et al . ) .",
    "these formulae are only valid for metallicities @xmath223 ; the range is set by the limits of the employed stellar evolutionary models ( hurley et al .",

    "the eddington limited accretion onto an @xmath8 black hole may give a rise to high x - ray luminosity @xmath226 erg s@xmath10 and @xmath227 erg s@xmath10 in case of hydrogen and helium accretion , respectively .",
    "such high luminosities are comparable with x - ray emission of many known ulxs ( e.g. , madhusudhan et al .",
    "2008 ; zampieri & roberts 2009 ) .",
    "for the most massive stars that will form maximum mass bhs , we have estimated the contribution of specific winds in the overall mass loss from a star . for high metallicities , most mass is lost during main sequence evolution ( @xmath228 ) , later lbv winds also remove a significant part of the star s initial mass ( @xmath134 ) while finally the exposed naked helium star further loses mass ( @xmath229 ) in wr - like winds . for very low metallicities ,",
    "the majority of mass is lost during the lbv phase ( @xmath230 ) with only small mass loss on the main sequence ( @xmath149 ) , while the wr phase is not encountered ( i.e. , star never loses its h - rich envelope ) . for intermediate metallicities ,",
    "the mass is lost in comparable quantities during the main sequence and lbv phases ( @xmath152 ) , with a small contribution to mass loss from wr - like winds ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "our approach , based on one set of stellar evolution models by hurley et al .",

    "the results of our comparisons are presented in table  [ mod50 ] and  [ mod100 ] .",
    "we note that the results , both for the analytic formulae and for detailed evolutionary calculations , show the same trends ; for example the mass of the he core at the end of main sequence is higher for the old hurley et al .",
    "winds as compared to models with the new vink et al . winds .",
    "but the ez code typically predicts he core masses that are @xmath231 higher than those produced by our analytic formulae .",
    "our analytic formulae were based on the revised eggleton evolutionary code ( pols et al .",

    "even with very similar codes , properties in the core still have large differences .",
    "the shape of our black hole mass distribution is sensitive to these uncertainties .",
    "however , the maximum black hole mass is produced in systems where the entire star collapses down to a black hole . to first order",
    ", the maximum black hole mass depends upon the final stellar mass and not on the internal stellar structure .",
    "the final stellar mass depends mostly on the wind mass loss rates , but it changes also with the adopted stellar evolutionary model ( which results in different luminosities , radii , etc .",
    "so the same mass loss prescription gives a different rate ) .",
    "thus , our results are in the end limited by the details of stellar evolutionary modeling uncertainties",
    ". it would be very useful if the stellar evolutionary community could provide the final stellar masses that are obtained with different codes .",

    "some stellar evolutionary models employ rotation ( heger et al .",

    "2009 ) . for stars that rotate fast ( either low metallicity single stars or tidally locked stars in close binaries )",
    ", the effect of rotation may play an important role on their evolution and subsequent formation of the compact object remnant .",
    "the primary effect of rotation is mixing of additional material into the central part of the star where burning is taking place , thus leading to the formation of a more massive core ( as compared with non - rotating models ) .",
    "this should lead , in principle , to the formation of more massive remnants ( e.g. , it should increase the maximum black hole mass ) .",
    "however , rotation makes a star oblate , increasing the temperature of the polar regions .",
    "thus , there is more radiation to drive winds , and the net effect may be an increase in mass loss from a rapidly spinning star leading to a lower presupernova mass and so , reduction of the final compact object mass .",
    "it is not completely clear what would be the full effect of rotation on the maximum black hole mass , especially since the initial rotation of massive stars is not known , and this is particularly true for low metallicities .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that our conclusions are obtained only for single star models . in other words",
    "we do not take into account potential effects of binary evolution .",
    "those , in principle , may increase the mass of a black hole ( via accretion from a close companion ) or reduce its mass ( by mass loss from its progenitor ) .",
    "additionally , the black hole masses that are known come from the observations of very specific types of sources : x - ray binaries ; and thus it may be possible that either some evolutionary and/or observational selection effects hide the true , intrinsic maximum black hole mass . therefore , by its nature , this is only a proof - of - principle study demonstrating that with some ( widely used ) evolutionary models and a set of ( updated ) metallicity - dependent stellar winds , regular single star evolution can naturally explain the metallicity - dependence of the most massive black holes that are known today .",
    "additionally , it needs to be highlighted that all three major components used in our study _",
    "( i ) _ stellar evolution models , _ ( ii ) _ wind mass loss rate predictions and _ ( iii ) _ core collapse / supernova calculations that are _ all _ very important in remnant mass estimates are burdened with significant uncertainties and sometimes even unknowns .",

    "<S> we present the spectrum of compact object masses : neutron stars and black holes that originate from single stars in different environments . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we calculate the dependence of maximum black hole mass on metallicity and on some specific wind mass loss rates ( e.g. , hurley et al . and vink et al . ) . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed in the galaxy @xmath0 in the high metallicity environment ( @xmath1 ) can be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here . to reach this result we had to set luminous blue variable mass loss rates at the level of @xmath2 and to employ metallicity dependent wolf - rayet winds . with such winds , calibrated on galactic black hole mass measurements , the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity ( @xmath3 ) is @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a rather striking finding as the mass of the most massive known stellar black hole is @xmath5 and , in fact , it is located in a small star forming galaxy with moderate metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the very low ( globular cluster - like ) metallicity environment the maximum black hole mass can be as high as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that x - ray luminosity from eddington limited accretion onto an @xmath8 black hole is of the order of @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 and is comparable to luminosities of some known ulxs . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that our results were obtained for single stars only and that binary interactions may alter these maximum black hole masses ( e.g. , accretion from a close companion ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is strictly a proof - of - principle study which demonstrates that stellar models can naturally explain even the most massive known stellar black holes . </S>"
