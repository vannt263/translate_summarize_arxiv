    "clustering properties of galaxies are closely related to the distribution and amount of underlying dark matter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , measuring clustering properties of galaxies is very useful for understanding the dark side of galaxy properties ( different from stellar properties ) .",
    "clustering properties in the present - day universe have been well investigated using recent wide - field surveys such as 2dfgrs @xcite and sdss @xcite .",
    "clustering properties of galaxies are derived from spatial or angular two - point correlation functions ( cfs ) , and are compared with those of the dark matter predicted by cold dark matter ( cdm ) models @xcite .",

    "they have found that the spatial distribution of @xmath26 lbgs is strongly biased relative to the dark matter distribution predicted by cdm models with a linear bias of 4.5 for an einstein - de sitter cosmology ( see also @xcite ) . in a subsequent paper , @xcite have found the clustering amplitude of @xmath28 lbgs to depend on their rest - frame ultraviolet luminosity , with fainter galaxies less strongly clustered , which is a similar property to that found in the present - day universe . @xcite",

    "the completeness of each sample is 40 - 60% in the most efficient redshift range .",
    "the small ratio of contaminants in @xmath69-lbgs is due to the fact that the @xmath69-lbg sample includes many faint lbgs beyond @xmath82 , which are much more numerous than foreground contaminants .      in order to examine how well these selection criteria isolate true lbgs",

    "we find that the photometric zero points are accurate within 0.1 mag over the whole field of view for any bandpass , since psf - like objects are found to make a single sharp stellar locus in any two - color plane as shown in sds v. then we examine whether there are spatial differences in the source detection efficiency by ( 1 ) calculating the number densities of all detected objects in small ( @xmath94 ) areas covering the survey region , ( 2 ) measuring the limiting magnitudes in 2700 small ( @xmath95 ) areas for each of the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath96 images , and ( 3 ) estimating the detection completeness of lbgs and laes from monte carlo simulations in the same manner as used in sds ii .",
    "we find no clear sign of inhomogeneity in either of ( 1)-(3 ) for the sdf data . on the other hand ,",
    "we find a systematic difference in the detection limits for the sxdf data with a 0.2 magnitude level on arcminute scales .",
    "this is probably because the majority of the sxdf data were taken in 2000 , when the ccds installed were a mixture of products of two companies and so had a large variety in quantum efficiency .",
    "figures [ fig : sdf_dist_z4]-[fig : sxdf_dist_z5 ] show , however , that there is no correlation between the source distribution and the ccd positions .",
    "this demonstrates that the inhomogeneities seen in figures [ fig : sdf_dist_z4]-[fig : sxdf_dist_z5 ] are real , although distributions of lbgs in the sxdf on arcminute scales could be contaminated by the somewhat large inhomogeneities in the limiting magnitude .      in order to quantitatively measure the inhomogeneity of spatial distribution",

    "there is a marginal signal for @xmath71-lbgs in the sdf , and no signal is detected for @xmath70-lbgs and @xmath71-lbgs in the sxdf .",

    "the @xmath110 value of @xmath71-lbgs is only at the @xmath124 significance level .",

    "they obtain @xmath290 , @xmath291 , and @xmath16 for lbgs at @xmath41 and @xmath3 and laes at @xmath43 , respectively , which are comparable to our results ( @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and @xmath294 ) . @xcite have found an indication that the simple halo model may not work for small - scale clustering ( @xmath295 corresponding to @xmath296 mpc ) of laes . in our analysis , we obtain the bias at a large scale ( at @xmath218 mpc ) , and do not examine whether @xmath297 is fit to @xmath298 on small scales . in this sense ,",
    "our analysis is simpler than theirs .    in table [ tab : halo_mass_lstar ] , we summarize the properties of dark halo hosting @xmath7 lbgs ( and laes ) , which are extracted from table [ tab : halo_mass ] .",
    "we find the typical mass of dark halos hosting @xmath7 lbgs is @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 for @xmath26 , @xmath302 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "thus the dark halo masses hosting @xmath7 lbgs are almost constant around @xmath16 which is comparable to the total mass of the milky way galaxy at the present epoch .",
    "although there might be a trend that the typical mass decreases slightly with redshift , we find no clear difference in the mass range of dark halos hosting lbgs with @xmath303 ( @xmath304 or , equivalently , sfr@xmath305 [ @xmath306@xmath307yr@xmath49 before [ after ] extinction correction ) over @xmath169 .",
    "this finding suggests that the mass - to - luminosity ratio of lbgs ( the mass of a hosting halo divided by a uv - luminosity of the lbg in the halo ) does not change largely from @xmath26 to 5 . in other words ,",
    "the star formation efficiency is almost constant over @xmath169 .",
    "this suggestion may not be consistent with the theoretical prediction that the star - formation efficiency increases with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_func_diff_z4 ] and table [ tab : halo_mass ] show that the occupation number , @xmath232 , of lbgs for massive dark halos ( @xmath308 ) is close to unity while @xmath232 for less massive halos ( @xmath309 ) is about 0.1 .",
    "thus , it is concluded that more massive halos possess a larger number of lbgs .",
    "note that a similar feature is found for the 2dfgrs galaxies at @xmath19 in the range of dark halo mass of of @xmath310 as shown in figure [ fig : mass_func_diff_z0 ] .      in this section",
    ", we discuss relations between lbgs , laes , @xmath18-band selected galaxies ( fires ) , and scuba sources .",
    "these galaxies are named after the search techniques ( section [ sec : introduction ] ) , and are all located at high redshifts .",
    "little has been known to date about relations between these galaxy populations .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_func_diff_z0 ] plots the observed number densities of these high-@xmath15 galaxies against the predicted masses of dark halos of their descendants at @xmath19 . in this figure",
    ", the thick solid curve corresponds to the best - fit function to the observed relation between the bias parameter and the number density for our @xmath41 lbgs ( figure [ fig : bias_norberg ] of section [ sec : spatial_segregation_lbg_uv ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the data points of lbgs at both @xmath26 and @xmath43 ( blue and red circles ) are located very close to this curve .",
    "this suggests that lbgs at @xmath169 are a single population in terms of the mass of hosting halos and the halo occupation number .",
    "we propose here that lbgs at @xmath169 come from a single parent population of galaxies , assuming that any dark halo more massive than a critical value has such parent galaxies and that the stellar mass of these galaxies is proportional to the mass of the dark halo .",
    "these parent galaxies can be detected by nir surveys such as fires , because nir surveys sample galaxies according to their rest - frame optical luminosity , i.e. , their stellar mass .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_func_diff_z3 ] shows that the number density of fires galaxies is 10 times higher than that of lbgs at the same mass range of dark halos . if lbgs are star - forming galaxies with intermittent star formation activities as suggested in section [ sec : galaxy_hosting_z4 ] , this difference in the number density reflects probably the total duration time of active star formation in galaxies .",
    "both lbgs and fires galaxies are seen at @xmath311 and @xmath312 , and the cosmic time between these two redshifts is @xmath313 yrs .",
    "if we assume that lbgs are visible in optical observations ( i.e. , bright in the rest - frame uv wavelength ) only when they are in a phase of active star formation , then the total duration time of star formation between @xmath311 and @xmath312 is estimated to be @xmath314 yrs .",
    "this value is comparable to the typical age of stellar populations of lbgs , @xmath315 yrs , given by @xcite .",
    "they have derived the age from a fitting of model spectra to the observed optical - to - nir colors of lbgs at @xmath28 , assuming that the star formation history of lbgs is approximated by an exponentially decaying star - formation rate .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that the typical star - formation rate of lbgs is @xmath316yr ( whose values are extinction - corrected by a factor of 4 : see figure 16 and section 5 of sds v ) , then the stellar mass accumulating from @xmath43 to 3 ( @xmath317yrs ) is estimated to be roughly @xmath318/10 \\times ( 20 - 200 )   [ m_\\odot { \\rm yr}^{-1 } ] \\sim ( 2 - 20 ) \\times 10 ^ 9 m_\\odot$ ] .",
    "this value is comparable to the typical stellar masses of lbgs at @xmath28 derived by @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if lbgs are fires galaxies in a phase of star formation , lbgs should have similar stellar masses to fires galaxies .",
    "this prediction is supported by @xcite s finding that while fires galaxies are slightly less luminous in the observed - frame @xmath18 band than the brightest lbgs , their stellar masses are comparable to , or higher than , the brightest lbgs. the data point of scuba sources ( star mark ) is located at the high - mass end of the solid curve in figure [ fig : mass_func_diff_z0 ] .",
    "this coincidence would indicate that scuba sources and lbgs belong to the same population . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : spatial_segregation_lbg_uv ] , brighter lbgs have larger dark - halo masses , indicating that lbgs with higher star - formation rates reside in more massive dark halos .",
    "the star formation rates of scuba sources , @xmath319yr , are ( much ) higher than those of lbgs , @xmath320yr after extinction correction .",
    "thus , the correlation found for our lbgs at @xmath41 holds for scuba sources as well .",
    "we have also found a possible connection of dusty lbgs to scuba sources in the analysis of section [ sec : spatial_segregation_lbg_dust ] .",
    "we have found a probable connection between lbgs , fires galaxies , and scuba sources as discussed above .",
    "however , laes at @xmath31 can not be understood in a similar way .",
    "since laes are also star - forming galaxies , they should be located near the solid curve in figure [ fig : mass_func_diff_z0 ] , if they belong to the same population as lbgs . in this case ,",
    "laes are expected to be located near the low - mass end of the solid curve , because the typical star - formation rate of laes is only about @xmath321 ( @xmath262 ) @xmath322yr with ( without ) dust extinction correction.yr . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that the dust extinction of laes is comparable to that of lbgs at z=4 , i.e. , e(b - v)=0.15 , we obtain 10@xmath322yr for the extinction corrected sfr .",
    "these values are comparable to , or lower than , the average extinction - corrected sfr for the faintest subsample of @xmath69-lbgs , although the dust extinction amount of laes is not yet well constrained . however , as found from figure [ fig : mass_func_diff_z0 ] , laes deviate largely from the solid curve toward higher halo masses ; dark halos hosting laes are as massive as those hosting bright lbgs .",
    "] we think that this apparent discrepancy is related to ( i ) a large cosmic variance in the lae sample of sds ii and/or ( ii ) a selection bias of laes .",
    "first , as we note in section [ sec : spatial_angular ] , the surveyed volume for their laes is just @xmath132mpc@xmath130 , and thus the results could be strongly affected by the field variance . in reality , @xcite have found that their laes make a large - scale structure , and it is possible that the clustering derived in sds ii is biased high due to the large - scale structure .",
    "second , star - forming galaxies with relatively bright lyman @xmath30 emissions can be selected as laes even when their star formation rates ( i.e. , uv luminosities ) are considerably low .",
    "we have found in sds ii that laes brighter in lyman @xmath30 emission are clustered more strongly while clustering strength does not clearly correlate with uv luminosity . if this correlation holds for all star - forming galaxies , the clustering strength of laes should be higher than that of general star - forming galaxies with similar star - formation rates , resulting in very massive dark halos for laes .",
    "the cause of this lyman @xmath30 luminosity bias is not clear to us , but a possible explanation is that the lyman @xmath30 luminosities of galaxies increase ( only ) when they infall toward massive dark halos .",
    "when galaxies infall toward massive halos , star formation may be triggered in them due to , for instance , interactions with the halos .",
    "since the duration of strong lyman @xmath30 emission is very short , galaxies with strong lyman @xmath30 emission will be found only around massive halos , and thus laes have strong clustering .",
    "@xcite have discussed a similar scenario for high-@xmath15 starburst galaxies . in this explanation",
    ", we assume that lyman @xmath30 luminosity correlates with star formation rate fairly well .",
    "however , this assumption may not necessarily be true .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that lbgs with stronger lyman @xmath30 emissions have older stellar populations , contrary to the predictions from simple hii region models . in any case",
    ", our knowledge about the nature of laes is still poor .",
    "it is of great importance to accumulate the data of laes by new observations to infer more accurately their fundamental quantities such as halo mass , stellar mass , and star formation rate . finally , we summarize our unified view for high-@xmath15 galaxies ( i.e. , lbgs , fires galaxies , scuba sources , and laes ) , which we have proposed in this subsection . at @xmath323 , dark halos with @xmath309 host a few galaxies ( section [ sec : galaxy_hosting_z3 ] ) whose stellar masses are large enough to be detected as fires galaxies .",
    "most of the galaxies hosted by these dark halos are quiescent in star - formation , but about one tenth have a moderately strong star - formation activity ( sfr@xmath324yr ) , producing a bright uv continuum and thus being identified as lbgs .",
    "hence , fires galaxies are the parent population for lbgs according to our view .",
    "lbgs found at @xmath325 and 5 are not necessarily on the same evolutionary track , since the duration of a single star formation for lbgs is expected to be much shorter than the cosmic times between @xmath26 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "more massive dark halos tend to host lbgs with higher sfrs , and extremely massive dark halos with @xmath308 have a starburst galaxy with sfr@xmath326yr , which is identified as a scuba source .",
    "the relationship between laes and the other high-@xmath15 galaxies is not clear .      in sections [ sec : discussions_unified ]",
    ", we have proposed that lbgs and scuba sources are high-@xmath15 star - forming galaxies emerged from the same parent population . in our proposal ,",
    "high-@xmath15 galaxies experience many episodic star - forming phases with star - formation rate of @xmath327 yr@xmath49 , whose characteristic total duration time is @xmath328myr ( per 1 gyr ) .",
    "the diversity of the properties of star - formation galaxies may be due to the variety of star - formation rate .",

    "v , we have found that the luminosity function of lbgs does not change from @xmath41 to @xmath26 , while the number of bright lbgs ( @xmath330 ; extinction - corrected sfr is @xmath331 yr@xmath49 ) drops toward @xmath43 . if we assume that the star - formation efficiency is constant from @xmath43 to @xmath41 , this implies that massive galaxies ( with large cold gas reservoirs ) are rare at @xmath332 since matter ( baryon + dark matter ) has not been assembled by the gravitational instability at @xmath43 .",
    "however , the cosmic star - formation rate density is almost constant from @xmath34 to @xmath333 ( sds v ) .",
    "this is because the major contributors to the cosmic star formation are galaxies with smaller star - formation rates @xmath334yr@xmath49 ( sds v ) .",
    "then , most of the galaxies with active star formation of @xmath335 yr@xmath49 disappear in the present - day universe ( figure 16 of sds v ) .",
    "this reduction of galaxies with intensive star - forming activities leads to the decrease in the star - formation rate density from @xmath333 to @xmath19 .    on the other hand ,",
    "dark matter is continuously assembled through the cosmic time ( figure [ fig : z_r0_bias ] ) .",
    "thus the clustering amplitude , or correlation length , of the dark matter monotonically increases with time .",
    "however , the correlation length of galaxies with @xmath7 does not significantly change from @xmath43 to @xmath19 because the galaxy - dark matter bias ( @xmath175 ) decreases with time .",
    "thus , the galaxy clustering at @xmath43 is similar to that at the present epoch .",
    "this is the reason why sds iv discovered the large - scale structure of galaxies at @xmath43 .",

    "this would indicate that the majority of present - day field galaxies were formed at @xmath337 , or that high-@xmath15 progenitors of field galaxies are much fainter than the limiting magnitudes of today s observations ( @xmath338 and @xmath339 ) .",
