    "the properties of electron gas are investigated in several works @xcite .",
    "one of the important cases , is the ferromagnetism of electron gas @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization may appear in different densities for different temperatures and the polarization of the system is a function of density and temperature . by assuming the spin - spin interaction inside the system we can study the magnetic property of the system .",
    "several models study the possibility of existence of ferromagnetism phase inside the solids by assuming the lattice system @xcite . for gas systems by using the statistical methods for an imperfect fermi gas we can show that the ferromagnetism phase can be exist @xcite . in current work",
    "we examine the possibility of existence of ferromagnetism phase inside the fermi gas by one photon exchange interaction between two electron and fermi liquid model to calculate the energy density of the system . because the spin dependence of the landau fermi liquid interaction function is due to the relativistic effects ( spin - spin and spin - orbit interaction ) and the exchange interaction @xcite",
    ", we calculate the direct and exchange diagrams contributions ( with defined spin directions ) to thermodynamic quantities , in relativistic formalism . after this",
    "we obtain the non - relativistic limit , because in the ultra - relativistic region the exchange interaction becomes repulsive and can not cause to ferromagnetic phase inside system . by varying the free energy with respected to the p(polarization parameter ) at various density and temperature we can find the minimum of the free energy for given density and temperature . at end",
    ", we obtained the magnetic susceptibility of system at zero temperature , and our results shoe that the @xmath0 has a divergence .",
    "this means that the phase transition is second order inside the system .",
    "to obtain the exchange and direct diagrams contributions we write the lorentz invariant matric elements for two electron scattering in order @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown that the direct diagram portion in energy density is @xcite @xmath2 the @xmath3 becomes zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "so we can ignore the direct interactions and only calculate the exchange interactions contribution in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we define the up and down spin states in the rest frame of each electron , with the vector @xmath4 . where the up and down spin states corresponded to the @xmath5 signs .",
    "electrons with momentum @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 are described by spinors @xmath8 , where the @xmath9 is a lorentz vector . in the rest frame of particles",
    "the @xmath9 reduced to the unit spatial vector @xmath4 .",
    "the components of @xmath9 in the frame which the particle moves with momentum @xmath10 are obtained by lorentz transformation @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "it can be checked that the eq([2 ] ) satisfied the normalization and orthogonality conditions , which in the rest frame are evidence .",

    "the polarization density matrix can be written as@xcite : @xmath14 for exchange interaction we can write the lorentz invariant matrix element as follow @xcite : @xmath15 it must mentioned that if we use above relation in landau theory , then the stability of the fermi liquid do not satisfied . if we add a term like @xmath16 in the dominator of the eq.([4 ] ) , then the stability can satisfied .",
    "the @xmath16 can interpreted as higher order corrections to the gauge boson propagator . for simplicity",

    "we can use the @xmath36 approximation and then we have : @xmath37 one can see that if we have @xmath21 then the lorentz invariant matrix elements vanishes , this means that in non - relativistic region the spin flip contribution in interaction energy density vanishes .",
