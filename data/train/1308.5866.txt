    "this is a generalisation of the hopf deplumbing criterion proved by etnyre and li  @xcite ( theorem  3.3 ) . in terms of the homological arc complex defined in their paper",

    ", this seems to be a consequence of corollary  3 in giroux - goodman  @xcite .",
    "however , the discussion there only implies that positive braid knots are connected to the trivial knot by a sequence of positive trefoil plumbing and deplumbing operations .",
    "we conclude the introduction with an application of theorem  2 , the precise meaning of which we will explain in section  5 .",
    "the fibre surface of a positive braid knot of genus @xmath14 can be untwisted by @xmath14 ribbon twists .    in the last section",

    "the iterated images @xmath19 are easy to determine : they are indeed homologically independent and pairwise disjoint , as shown in figure  2 , for @xmath8 .",

    ". then the tangent vectors of @xmath22 and @xmath21 are required to form a positive basis of @xmath23 , at their common boundary points ( compare figures  2 and  3 ) .",
    "right - veering diffeomorphisms were introduced by honda et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of contact geometry .",

    "setting @xmath26 we obtain @xmath0 homologically independent embedded circles @xmath27 .",
    "after a suitable isotopy , these circles form a chain , i.e. the only intersection points arise from pairs of consecutive circles . here the right - veering property is absolutely essential .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  3 for @xmath28 , where the bold and thin lines represent @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ( the vertical line being @xmath31 ) .",

    "a braid is positive , if it contains positive crossings only .",
    "standard generators @xmath36 are used to denote positive crossings .",
    "braid words are read from top to bottom , in accordance with the second author s convention  @xcite .",
    "we use brick diagrams as an alternative notation for positive braids , as well as their fibre surfaces , see figure  4 .",
    "the diagram on the right shows the fibre surface of the braid @xmath37 , an embedded orientable surface whose boundary is the closure of that braid and which naturally retracts on the brick diagram .",
    "it is instructive to verify that the isotopy type of the fibre surface is invariant under the braid relations @xmath38 .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will only consider reduced braids , i.e. braids with at least two crossings between all strands .",
    "in other words , every column of the brick diagram contains at least one rectangle .",
    "every rectangle defines a simple closed curve whose neighbourhood in the fibre surface is a positive hopf band .",
    "the left- and topmost rectangle defines a hopf band which can be deplumbed , since it lies on top of the surface ( compare figure  4 ) . on the level of braids ,",
    "this amounts to removing one crossing on the top left .",
    "therefore , fibre surfaces of reduced positive braids admit a positive hopf plumbing structure .",
    "this well - known fact is due to stallings  @xcite .",
    "as explained in detail by dehornoy  @xcite , the monodromy can be written as a product of right - handed dehn twists , one for each rectangle , in the order of plumbing , i.e. from the bottom right to the top left , filling up columns from the right to the left .",
    "we will make use of this in the proof of theorem  2 .",
    "the proof of theorem  2 relies on the following well - known fact , which can be found at various places in the literature , e.g. in franks - williams  @xcite .",
    "every positive braid whose closure is a non - trivial link contains the square of a generator , @xmath39 , up to braid relations .",
    "here braid relations are understood in a generalised sense , including conjugation and markov moves .",
    "let @xmath40 be a positive braid representing a non - trivial link . by the braid relation , we may remove all instances of @xmath41 in @xmath40 . if there is only one single crossing of type @xmath42 left , we remove it by a markov move .",
    "otherwise @xmath40 contains a section of the form @xmath43 with either no @xmath44 or at least two @xmath44 s in @xmath45 . in the first case we are done ; in the second case @xmath40 contains a section of the form @xmath46 with no @xmath42 in @xmath45 and either no @xmath47 or at least two @xmath47 s in @xmath45 .",
    "this argument eventually leads to a proof of the statement .    the fibre surface associated with the braid",
    "@xmath48 is a positive hopf band .",
    "more generally , let @xmath40 be a positive braid that contains a square @xmath39 , then the corresponding fibre surface contains a hopf band which can actually be deplumbed , since it lies on top of the surface .",
    "this provides an alternative proof that fibre surfaces of positive braids admit a positive hopf plumbing structure .",
    "the monodromy of positive braid links is right - veering , since it can be written as a product of right - handed dehn twists  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we may apply the criterion of theorem  1 to the open books associated with positive braids . instead of looking at iterates of an arc @xmath11 under the monodromy  @xmath5 , we will consider a simple closed curve  @xmath49 of the form @xmath50 and verify that @xmath51 does not intersect @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath40 be a positive braid representing a non - trivial knot .",
    "by lemma  1 , we may assume that @xmath40 contains a square @xmath39 .",
    "after a suitable conjugation , we may further assume that @xmath40 starts with @xmath52 for some numbers @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , @xmath40 contains at least one more generator @xmath54 , since it represents a knot .",
    "let @xmath11 be an essential relative arc in the uppermost band and let @xmath55 be the simple closed curve running once through the hopf band associated with @xmath39 .",
    "in order to determine the image @xmath51 , we decompose the monodromy as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of columns of the brick diagram , and each @xmath58 is a product of right - handed dehn twists in the @xmath59-th column , from the bottom to the top .",
    "the last @xmath60 factors @xmath61 do not affect the curve  @xmath49 .",
    "indeed , a dehn twist ` along a rectangle ' affects another rectangle , if and only if their curves intersect .",
    "this happens precisely when the two rectangles are arranged as in the braids @xmath62 , @xmath63 , or @xmath64 .",
    "the effect of the monodromy on a single rectangle is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the map @xmath65 shifts the curve  @xmath49 down , as shown on the left of figure  5 .",
    "the map @xmath66 adds a certain union of rectangles to its left .",
    "all subsequent factors @xmath58 ( @xmath67 ) add one layer of rectangles to the curve @xmath68 , as long as their union forms a staircase .",
    "figure  5 illustrates this process for the braid @xmath69 the curves @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are shown from left to right . in that example , the last factor @xmath73 does not have any effect on the curve @xmath72 .",
    "we observe that @xmath51 does not intersect the arc @xmath31 .",
    "now theorem  1 allows us to apply trefoil deplumbing , which amounts to cutting @xmath1 along the arcs @xmath31 and @xmath74 , i.e. cutting the upper two bands associated with @xmath39 . on the level of braids",
    ", this simply means removing @xmath39 .",
    "it is instructive to verify that a neighbourhood of the theta graph @xmath75 is indeed isotopic to the fibre surface of a positive trefoil knot ( see again figure  5 ) .",
    "we conclude by induction .",
    "a ribbon twist is an operation on seifert surfaces that inserts a full twist into a ribbon , as shown in figure  6 .",
    "two seifert surfaces are twist equivalent if they are related by a finite number of ribbon twists .",
    "generic seifert surfaces are unlikely to be twist equivalent , since ribbon twists preserve the homotopy type of the surface complement in @xmath76 . here",
    "we will show that fibre surfaces of positive braid knots can be untwisted in a natural way .",
    "a seifert surface of genus @xmath14 is trivial if it admits @xmath14 disjoint non - isotopic compression discs on either side .. ] in particular , the complement of a trivial seifert surface is homeomorphic to a handlebody of genus @xmath77 .",
    "a simple example for @xmath78 is depicted in figure  6 , on the right .",
    "@xmath79 @xmath80    the sequence of diagrams in that figure shows that the fibre surface of the positive trefoil knot can be untwisted in one move .",
    "the last isotopy is best seen by dragging one end of the hopf band once around the untwisted annulus .",
    "in fact , the same sequence of diagrams , combined with the isotopy of figure  7 , demonstrates that positive trefoil plumbing can be expressed as a connected sum with a compressible torus , followed by a single ribbon twist . as a consequence , a seifert surface @xmath81 that is obtained by @xmath14-times iterated positive trefoil plumbing can be untwisted by @xmath14 ribbon twists .",
    "moreover , the number @xmath14 is minimal , since the unknotting number of the boundary knot @xmath82 is not smaller than @xmath14 ( see rudolph  @xcite ) .",
    "this proves corollary  1 .",
    "@xmath80    we conclude this section with a basic question : which fibre surfaces of genus @xmath14 in @xmath76 can be untwisted by @xmath14 ribbon twists ?",
    "the purpose of this section is to detect large @xmath0-plumbing summands in fibre surfaces of torus links . using a result of hironaka on the behaviour of the alexander polynomial under iterated trefoil plumbing  @xcite",
    ", we will determine the largest @xmath0-plumbing summand for fibre surfaces of all 3-stranded torus knots .",
    "we define a torus link of type @xmath83 as the closure of the braid @xmath84 the fibre surface of the torus knot @xmath85 is shown in figure  8 .",
    "as explained in section  3 , the left- and topmost rectangle defines a hopf band which can be deplumbed .",
    "let @xmath49 be the core curve of that hopf band .",
    "as in the proof of theorem  2 , we decompose the monodromy as @xmath86 , where @xmath58 denotes the product of dehn twists in the @xmath59-th column , from the bottom to the top .",
    "we claim that for all @xmath87 , the curve @xmath88 runs once around the uppermost rectangle in the @xmath89-th column . indeed ,",
    "let us suppose this is true for some @xmath90 , and let us write @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) for the curve defined by the uppermost rectangle in the @xmath93-th column ( in particular , @xmath94 ) .",
    "the first factor of the monodromy @xmath5 that affects the curve @xmath95 is @xmath96 . in fact , @xmath97 is a curve running once around the union of @xmath95 and @xmath98 .",
    "the next factor @xmath99 then removes @xmath95 from that curve , thus @xmath100 the subsequent factors @xmath101 do not affect the curve @xmath98 .",
    "figure  8 illustrates this process for the torus knot @xmath85 and @xmath102 . for a more detailed analysis of the monodromy of lorenz links , including torus links ,",
    "we refer the reader to section  2 of  @xcite .    keeping in mind that @xmath55 , where @xmath11 is an essential relative arc in the uppermost band , we deduce that the family of arcs @xmath103 is pairwise disjoint . as a consequence ,",

    ", we obtain the entire surface as a @xmath105-plumbing summand , as expected . in general , the fibre surface obtained by deplumbing a @xmath105-summand from @xmath104 is not the fibre surface of a torus link ( and not even the fibre surface of a positive braid link , for that matter ) . in case a fibre surface",
    "@xmath1 admits an @xmath0-plumbing summand , we naturally obtain an embedded subsurface of type @xmath107 in @xmath1 . with this in mind , we will look for a large subsurface of type @xmath107 in @xmath108 . applying the braid relation three times , we obtain @xmath109 in particular , the fibre surface @xmath110 contains @xmath111 as a subsurface ( compare figure  9 ) . roughly speaking",
