    "the halo phenomenon is one of the most interesting topics in modern nuclear physics . since most open shell nuclei are deformed , the interplay between the deformation and the weak binding feature raises interesting questions . in order to give an adequate description of possible halo in a deformed nucleus",
    ", a model should be used which includes in a self - consistent way the continuum , large spatial distributions , deformation effects , and couplings among all these features . for this purpose , a deformed relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory in continuum has been developed and the halo phenomenon in deformed weakly bound nuclei is investigated .",
    "by solving the non - relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb )  @xcite or the relativistic hartree bogoliubov ( rhb )  @xcite equations in coordinate ( @xmath2 ) space , the mean field effects of the coupling to the continuum can be fully taken into account . with the relativistic continuum hartree - bogoliubov ( rchb )",

    "the decoupling between the deformations of the core and the halo may manifest itself by some new experimental observables , e.g. , the double - hump shape of longitudinal momentum distribution in single - particle removal reactions and new dipole modes , etc .",
