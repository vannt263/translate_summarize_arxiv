    ". a static renormalization of the hamiltonian parameters arises from phonon nonlinearities that involve even powers of @xmath9 .",
    "since these terms have finite time averages , the static ( time - averaged ) hamiltonian will be modified . for phonon nonlinearities of type i ( see tab.[tab : phonon ] )",
    ", this term leads to a static displacement of the zero - momentum raman phonon . for nonlinearities of type ii ,",
    "however , the frequency of the raman phonons is modified . in both cases",
    "we expect strong effects on the superconducting instability which can be analyzed following the standard migdal - eliashberg formalism  @xcite . in this paper",
    "our focus will mostly be on the effects of the dynamical ( oscillatory ) part of the drive on superconductivity .",
    "these effects can be divided into two contributions : first , the system parameters will generically oscillate in time due to the drive .",
    "second , nonlinearities that couple to finite momentum raman modes @xmath10 , as in case ii and iii , dynamically squeeze the phonons . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the different classes of phonon nonlinearities in more detail .      a nonlinear phonon coupling of form i : @xmath11 acts as a classical force on @xmath12 proportional to @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the drive @xmath14 can be separated in a static and an oscillatory contribution . taking a simple electron - phonon model in which the phonons modulate electron hopping processes @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the electron - phonon coupling and @xmath17 the electron creation operator ) as for example in a su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model  @xcite , the finite displacement of the lattice along the coordinates of the raman mode renormalizes the electron tunneling by a term @xmath18 , see supplementary information ( si ) .",
    "the effective electronic bandwidth is reduced when @xmath19 ; a condition that is material specific . reducing the bandwidth results in a higher density of states and hence an enhanced superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 . for @xmath20",
    "contrary is the case .",
    "these general considerations may account for the physical origin of the enhancement of the transition temperature which has been seen in _ ab initio _",
    "calculations for specific materials  @xcite . on top of the enhancement due to the time - averaged displacement of the raman phonon mode , the strong oscillations at @xmath21 can give rise to an additional dynamic enhancement of @xmath0 by the temporal proximity effect as as we discuss later in this work .",
    "another type of phonon nonlinearities in centro - symmetric crystals is the quartic form @xmath22 ( type ii ) . in this case , the coherently driven infrared phonon excites raman phonons in pairs and with opposite finite momenta , leading to quantum correlations between @xmath23 and @xmath24 modes .",
    "these states are referred to as _ squeezed states _ in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the drive can be again separated into a static and an oscillatory term with the implications of the static displacement being crucially dependent on the sign of the nonlinearity @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath26 the frequencies of the raman modes @xmath27 are softened and hence the effective electron - electron interaction , which is typically of the form @xmath28 , is increased , while for @xmath29 the opposite is the case . by contrast , we find that irrespective of the sign of the couplings , the oscillatory term squeezes the raman modes which results in a polaronic suppression of the electron tunneling matrix element compared to equilibrium and hence in an enhanced density of states .",
    "such an enhancement in the density of states in turn increase the superconducting coupling constant , enabling dynamic cooper pair formation at higher temperatures where equilibrium cooper pairing would be impossible .    in non - centrosymmetric crystals ,",
    "the lowest order phonon nonlinearity is of the cubic form iii : @xmath30 , which gives rise to phonon squeezing that leads to an enhanced @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the effect of phonon squeezing is largely insensitive to the microscopic details of the phonon nonlinearities .    in the remainder of this work",
    "we will focus on the type ii nonlinearity as it covers the static renormalization of the hamiltonian parameters , dynamical phonon squeezing , and the periodic modulation .",
    "moreover , it is relevant to recent experiments on fulleride superconductors  @xcite .",
    "further discussions regarding type i and type ii nonlinearities are provided in the si .",
    "we illustrate the aforementioned effects in detail using a minimal model with frhlich - type electron - phonon interactions that couple the displacement of the raman phonons @xmath31 to the local electron density @xmath32 : @xmath33 in this work , we consider dispersive optical phonons with mean frequency @xmath34 and spread @xmath35 . with the aforementioned quartic nonlinearities of type ii , the phonon drive term , introduced for @xmath36 , reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath7 is the amplitude of the driven infrared active phonon .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the electron tunneling is suppressed by polaronic dressing . upon hopping on the lattice ,",
    "the electron distorts it and drags phonons .",
    "for such a dressed tunneling process of the electron , the matrix element is suppressed by the franck - condon overlap of the shifted and unshifted phonon modes : @xmath39 $ ] . out of equilibrium",
    "we find an enhanced polaronic dressing due to the excited states of phonons .",
    "we emphasize that the effect of the drive is twofold .",
    "first , due to the static contribution , we find renormalized phonon frequencies , which for negative nonlinearities , @xmath40 , are softened by @xmath41 .",
    "the mode softening suppresses the electron tunneling .",
    "second , the time dependent part of the drive ( [ eq : phdrv ] ) realizes a parametrically driven oscillator which dynamically generates squeezing correlations and hence further suppresses the electron tunneling matrix element .",
    "while mode softening depends on the sign of the nonlinearity , the dynamical generation of squeezing correlations is a _ universal _",
    "process independent of the microscopic details .    before discussing the details of our analysis",
    ", we qualitatively describe the approach we introduce for studying non - equilibrium superconductivity .",
    "we perform the lang - firsov transformation ( _ cf . _",
    "methods ) , which eliminates the electron - phonon interaction term in equation  ( [ eq : hep ] ) but introduces an effective electron - electron interaction and dresses the electron tunneling with phonons .",
    "this dressing , which depends on the phonon squeezing , suppresses the electron tunneling and modulates it in time .",
    "our general strategy is to ( i ) take into account the softening of the raman modes by a static renormalization of the phonon coordinates and ( ii ) treat the dynamic excitation of finite - momentum phonons generated by the drive by transforming the system into a rotating frame in which the initial phonon distribution remains constant at all times ( _ cf .",
    "_ methods ) . since we are considering optical phonons , we assume their thermal occupation to be negligible before the drive was switched on . taking",
    "the phonon expectation value leads to the dressed electron tunneling matrix element @xmath42 .",
    "( iii ) we compute the rate of non - equilibrium cooper pair breaking processes resulting from dynamical excitations of the fermi sea induced by the drive and take into account the competition between the enhanced pair formation and pair breaking .",
    "this treatment is justified by showing _",
    "a posteriori _ that pair breaking is subdominant compared to pair formation .    solving the full problem numerically ( si ) we find that @xmath43 oscillates with twice the driving frequency @xmath44 around its mean value @xmath45 which is suppressed by mode softening and phonon squeezing , as parametrized by @xmath46 .",
    "near parametric resonance the squeezing correlations increase in time leading to a decrease in @xmath47 and an increase in the amplitude of its oscillations .",
    "since we are studying transient phenomena , we take the average over the first ten driving cycles to extract the effective electron tunneling , _ cf . _",
    "fig.[fig : jvt ] in the si .",
    "we take the electron - phonon coupling @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , which leads to a local hubbard - type electron - electron interaction @xmath50 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for phonons with wavevectors above the thomas - fermi screening length  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize however that this assumption is not crucial for our analysis . for technical convenience ,",
    "we transform the oscillatory part from the kinetic to the interaction term by rescaling time ( si ) , yielding the effective time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath51 where @xmath52 represent electron - phonon scattering terms that vanish upon taking the phonon - vacuum expectation value in the rotating frame .",
    "the drive , equation  ( [ eq : phdrv ] ) , has thus several effects : ( i ) a suppression of the electron tunneling by a factor @xmath53 $ ] , ( ii ) a dynamic floquet contribution from modulating the interaction energy by @xmath54 , and ( iii ) an enhancement of the electron scattering due to the non - equilibrium phonon occupation .",
    "we study the dynamical cooper instability toward pair formation in hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) by combining the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approach  @xcite with a floquet analysis  @xcite .",
    "we also take into account the finite electron lifetime @xmath55 due to the non - equilibrium phonon occupation , by introducing an imaginary self - energy correction @xmath56 ( calculated explicitly in the next section ) .",
    "in contrast to elastic scattering on a time - reversal symmetry preserving potential , where anderson s theorem  @xcite shows that the thermodynamics of a superconductor remains unchanged , the inelastic scattering processes arising here indeed alter the superconducting properties .     and effective attractive interactions @xmath57 that are weak compared to the bare electronic bandwidth @xmath58 , a phonon frequency spread of @xmath59 , driving strength @xmath60 , and driving frequency ( a ) @xmath61 and ( a ) @xmath62 .",
