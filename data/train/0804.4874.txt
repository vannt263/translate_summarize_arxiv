    "one of the most fundamental open issues in observational cosmology is what sources reionized the early universe . since the @xmath14 quasar luminosity function ( lf )",
    "is found to be too shallow to provide enough ionizing photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the most likely culprits are thought to be galaxies .",
    "a key question is therefore , how the star forming galaxy population evolves beyond the putative end of reionization at @xmath3 , i.e. , well into the epoch of reionization .    direct searches for ly@xmath15 emission",
    "provide a powerful way to study high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , it is difficult to estimate the ( continuum and ) ionizing flux of ly@xmath15 emitters , and thus their contribution to reionization .",
    "a more fruitful approach is provided by the lyman break technique .",
    "thousands of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) have been identified between @xmath16 3 and 6 from optical images , providing an estimate for the rest - frame uv lf at those redshifts ( e.g. oesch et al 2007 , hereafter o07 ; bouwens et al 2007 , hereafter b07 ; see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of the lbg lf throughout this redshift range is however still being debated : especially at the bright end , the strong clustering of bright galaxies and the tiny area coverage of space - based images prevent setting strong constraints on the lf . another important factor is that the number of spectroscopically confirmed lbgs is still small due to the faintness of the sources . within these caveats ,",
    "o07 and b07 have published independent , self - consistent analyses , which agree on a remarkably steady evolution of @xmath17 mag per unit redshift over the @xmath18 epoch .    at redshifts @xmath19 ,",
    "the rest - frame ly@xmath15  line shifts into the near - infrared ( nir ) and the relatively low efficiency and small field of view of current nir detectors have limited the identification of lbgs .",
    "thus , in contrast to the large number of sources detected out to @xmath3 , the numerous searches for @xmath13 lbgs have led to only a handful of candidates ( e.g. bouwens et al 2008 , hereafter b08 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "searches for intrinsically faint @xmath13 lbgs around lensing clusters also resulted only in small numbers of candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , due to the small areas subject to the lensing magnification .",
    "one of the most comprehensive studies is the recent analysis of b08 , who have measured the @xmath1 lbg lf from a large compilation of both hst and ground - based data , covering a total area of @xmath8 271 arcmin@xmath20 over the two fields of the goods survey @xcite . again within the caveats imposed by probing , with small number statistics , only the bright - end of the lf , these authors report that the dimming of the lbg lf which has been measured out to @xmath21 continues with no substantial change out to @xmath1 .",
    "a summary of the previous work in the context of reionization is that , albeit within some restrictive assumptions , the detected @xmath3 lbg population appears to be just barely able to maintain the universe ionized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",

    "the dashed line assumes the same evolution in @xmath2 but @xmath121 .",
    "the dash - dotted line corresponds to no evolution of the lf from @xmath3 out to @xmath149 ; the dotted one assumes the same but with the @xmath1 lf .",
    "if not stated otherwise all curves are integrated down to sfrs of @xmath150 m@xmath148yr .",
    "the corresponding electron scattering optical depths are also indicated . ]",
    "@xcite pointed out that , with the estimated @xmath1 lf of @xcite , the number of ionizing photons falls short by almost an order of magnitude even to just keep the universe ionized at @xmath1 . only models in which the star formation rate rises or stays constant beyond @xmath3 are able to provide enough ionizing photons .",
    "this result was however derived by including only galaxies with absolute magnitudes brighter than @xmath151 mag ; this corresponds to a lower limit for the star formation rate of @xmath152 m@xmath148yr ( see lower gray line in fig . [",
    "fig : qh2_evolvinglf ] ) . for lf faint - end slopes as steep as those that are measured , however , @xmath153 of the luminosity density comes from galaxies beyond the current detection limits at @xmath3 ( @xmath154 mag ) .",
    "thus , photons from these very faint galaxies will add a substantial contribution to the reionizing flux .",
    "here we adopt the results of our independent analysis of the @xmath1 lf , which , using substantially improved data products , confirms the drop in the star formation rate density from @xmath139 to @xmath140 suggested by @xcite .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite to estimate the contribution of galaxies to reionization .",
    "we include , however , the contribution of faint galaxies to reionization by decreasing the lower limit star formation rate to @xmath150 m@xmath148yr in our calculations .    computations of the filling factor of ionized hydrogen , @xmath155 , critically depend on the adopted values of the clumping factor @xmath85 and escape fraction @xmath156",
    ". scenarios with larger clumping factors lead to more efficient recombinations and thus require more ionizing photons ; lower escape fractions also require more photons . both the clumping factor and the escape fraction are however poorly known . to give an upper limit on the potential for reionization of the galaxy population , we adopt ( possibly somewhat optimistic ) values of @xmath157 , as found in simulations ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath158 , the upper limit that has been inferred from both observations and simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we neglect any possible mass dependence of @xmath156 .    assuming @xmath66 that the constant dimming of @xmath2 with redshift continues beyond @xmath13 and @xmath67 a faint - end slope @xmath15 which remains constant at the value @xmath159 that is measured at @xmath3 ( i.e. , our  fiducial \" evolution parameters ) , the galaxy population would be able to ionize the universe only up to a fraction @xmath160 ( see solid lines in fig . [",
    "fig : qh2_evolvinglf ] ) .",
    "the corresponding optical depth to electron scattering is @xmath161 , which is @xmath162 lower than the wmap-5 value of @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "thus , this reionization scenario starts too late , ionizing too few atoms at high redshifts .",
    "indeed the wmap-5 data suggest that the universe underwent an extended period of partial reionization , beginning as early as @xmath164 , similar to the double reionization scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "if by @xmath165 the universe is already substantially ionized by some other sources , the galaxy population would certainly be able to complete the reionization process by @xmath3 .",
    "another possibility is that the @xmath10 lf has a faint - end slope which is steeper than currently observed at @xmath3 ( predicted e.g. by * ? ? ?",
    "the current estimate(s ) do not allow one to rule out that the faint end of the lf at such early epochs is as steep as @xmath166 , which would result in a diverging luminosity density . to assess whether the faint galaxy population can provide enough additional photons to complete reionization by @xmath3",
    ", we adopt a value of @xmath121 ( see dotted line in fig . [",
    "fig : lfevol7 ] ) and recompute the filling factor of neutral hydrogen under these modified assumptions .",
    "this scenario is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qh2_evolvinglf ] as a dashed line .",
    "such a steep faint - end slope for the lf would result in an end of reionization by @xmath3 , and in an integrated electron scattering optical depth of @xmath167 , which is still substantially lower than the current wmap-5 value . for comparison , we also show in fig [ fig : qh2_evolvinglf ] the evolution of the hii filling factor assuming no evolution in the lf from @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) to @xmath149 .",
    "integrating the luminosity density again to @xmath150 m@xmath148yr , this results in the completion of reionization by @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) and in an optical depth @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that : @xmath66 in order for the galaxy population to provide a substantial contribution to reionization , galaxies below current detection limits must play a significant role ; @xmath67 under this assumption , a galaxy population which evolves by 0.35 mag per redshift unit would be able to ionize the universe by @xmath3 , provided that the lf faint - end slope is steeper than the @xmath159 value that is measured at redshifts @xmath172 ; @xmath68 even under this assumption , the resulting optical depth to electron scattering is lower by @xmath12 relative to the wmap-5 measurement , indicating that too few atoms are ionized at very high redshift .",
    "this finding provides evidence that , if reionization is primarily driven by galaxies , either the currently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at @xmath13 , or the lf evolution is compensated by a decrease in metallicity and a corresponding increase in ionization efficiency @xcite .",
    "otherwise , other sources must substantially participate to reionize our universe like miniquasars or population iii stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
