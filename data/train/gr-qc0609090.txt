    "varying speed of light ( vsl ) cosmologies have recently received considerable attention as alternatives to cosmological inflation to provide a different basis for resolving the problems of the standard model ( see for example @xcite and refs . therein ) . instead of adopting the inflationary idea",
    "that the very early universe experienced a period of superluminar expansion , in these universes one assumes that light travelled faster in the early universe . in such cosmological models",
    "the known puzzles of the standard early universe cosmology are absent at the cost of breaking the general covariance of the underlined gravity theory .",
    "we do not enter here into a discussion on the foundations of vsl theories and the conceptual problems arising from the very meaning of varying the speed of light ( see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "in this paper we report on some preliminary results of our on - going work @xcite on the application of the method of asymptotic splittings introduced in @xcite to study the singularities that may arise in vsl cosmologies .",
    "in particular , we focus here on the vsl model proposed in @xcite and further investigated in @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of this model is that one assumes minimal coupling at the level of the einstein equations so that a time - variable @xmath0 should not introduce changes in the curvature terms in einstein s equations in the cosmological frame , einstein s equations must still hold . as barrow points out @xcite , @xmath0 changes in the local lorentzian frames associated with the cosmological expansion , a special - relativistic effect , so that the resulting theory is not covariant and one has to make a specific choice of time coordinate . choosing that specific time to",

    "we assume an equation of state of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 and we write the friedman equations with varying @xmath5 and @xmath6 as follows : @xmath7@xmath8 here @xmath9 is the scale factor , @xmath10 or @xmath11 differentiating the first and using the second equation above we obtain the conservation equation @xmath12 and setting @xmath13 @xmath14 we obtain the non - autonomous system@xmath15 subject to the constraint @xmath16",
    "for flat ( @xmath17 ) models we set @xmath18 and the system ( [ nona ] ) becomes @xmath19 subject to the constraint@xmath20 this system is exactly that which was analyzed using the method of asymptotic splittings in @xcite , and we rewrite their result .",
    "putting @xmath21 we find the balance @xmath22 computation of the eigenvalues of the kovalevskaya matrix @xmath23 yields the values @xmath24 applying the constraint to the second equation we obtain an integrable system with general solution @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants of integration .",
    "we see that the density function always has a finite time singularity . on the other hand , the hubble",
    "parameter blows up in finite time only for @xmath28 it is interesting that the leading - order terms ( [ bala ] ) obtained from the calculation of the dominant balance already contain all the information provided by the exact solution ( [ exact ] ) , an effect due to the fact that the system is weight - homogeneous .",
    "we will report on the details of the full analysis of this system elsewhere .",
    "we assume a power - law dependence of the function @xmath29 @xmath30and use a system of units with @xmath31 we can avoid having to deal with denominators if we set @xmath32 @xmath33 then the system ( [ frie ] ) , ( [ rayc ] ) , ( cons ) becomes @xmath34and the constraint reads @xmath35we use the constraint to eliminate @xmath36 and write the system in the form @xmath37from eq .",
    "( [ const ] ) it follows that the phase space of ( [ 2-dim ] ) is the set @xmath38 for closed models , and @xmath39 for the open ones .",
    "note that the corresponding equations in general relativity have the feature that the conservation equation corresponding to the second equation in ( 2-dim ) is just @xmath40 which implies that the line @xmath41 is invariant , i.e. , the trajectories of the system can not cross the line @xmath42 on the other hand , here equations ( [ 2-dim ] ) without further assumptions do not guarantee that a solution curve starting at a point with @xmath43 will not eventually enter the region with @xmath44 which of course is unphysical .",
    "a first task of the method of asymptotic splittings is to find all possible asymptotic forms @xmath45 admitted by the system ( [ 2-dim ] ) .",
    "one balance gives @xmath46 with @xmath47 this has k - exponents @xmath48 .",
    "a second interesting balance is for @xmath49 with coefficients given by @xmath50the k - exponents are in this case given by the forms @xmath51 these results lead to formal series expansions of the solutions in a suitable neighborhood of the finite time singularity , they will be presented elsewhere , @xcite .",

    "we see that every initially expanding universe starting below this line eventually approaches the origin which corresponds to zero density and expansion rate . on the other hand , initially expanding universes starting above the dashed line eventually contract and @xmath53 @xmath54 in a finite time .",
    "numerical experiments confirm the above analysis .",
    "the reduction of the three dimensional dynamical system ( [ 3-d ] ) to the two - dimensional system ( [ 2-dim ] ) is not unique .",
    "we can use the constraint ( [ const ] ) to eliminate @xmath55 instead of @xmath56 however , we shall see that assuming a power - law dependence for @xmath57 as well , we can handle both cases at once . in this section",

    "first , we write the system it as a single differential equation , @xmath81 and we set @xmath82 to obtain a linear differential equation for @xmath83 which is easily integrable . we find that ( [ de ] ) has the general solution @xmath84where @xmath27 is a constant of integration .",
