    "however , the equivalence can be made precise and in fact the critical behavior goes to the bone of any failure or catastrophic phenomena .",

    "the dynamics of failure also become critically slow there and all these have been demonstrated analytically .",

    "a ` pile ' of dry sand is a unique example soc system in nature .",
    "a growing sandpile gradually comes to a ` quasi - stable ' state through its self - organising dynamics .",
    "this ` quasi - stable ' state is called the critical state of the system as the system exhibits power law behavior there . because of avalanches of all sizes , this critical point in the pile is also a catastrophic one .",
    "the dynamics of growing sandpiles are successfully modeled by the lattice model @xcite of bak , tang and wisenfeld ( btw ) in 1987 .",
    "a stochastic version of sand pile model has been introduced by manna @xcite which also shows soc , although it belongs to a different universality class . both the models have been studied extensively at their criticality . here , we study the sub - critical behavior of both the models and look for the precursors of the critical state .",

    "at each lattice site @xmath1 , there is an integer variable @xmath2 which represents the height of the sand column at that site .",
    "a unit of height ( one sand grain ) is added at a randomly chosen site at each time step and the system evolves in discrete time .",
    "the dynamics starts as soon as any site @xmath1 has got a height equal to the threshold value ( @xmath3= @xmath4 ) : the site topples , i.e. , @xmath2 becomes zero there , and the heights of the four neighboring sites increase by one unit @xmath5 if , due to this toppling at site @xmath1 , any neighboring site become unstable ( its height reaches the threshold value ) , they in turn follow the same dynamics .",
    "the process continues till all sites become stable ( @xmath6 @xmath3 for all @xmath1 ) . when toppling occurs at the boundary of the lattice ( four nearest neighbors are not available ) , extra heights get off the lattice and are removed from the system .    with a very slow but steady rate of addition of unit height ( sand grain ) at random sites of the lattice , the avalanches get correlated over longer and longer ranges and the average height ( @xmath7 ) of the system grows with time . gradually the correlation length ( @xmath8 ) becomes of the order the system size @xmath9 . here , on average , the additional height units start leaving the system as the system approaches toward a critical average height @xmath10 and the average height @xmath7 remains stable there ( see fig .",

    "the strength of the fibers are taken from a randomly distributed normalised density @xmath58 within the interval @xmath59 and @xmath60 such that @xmath61 the global load sharing assumption neglects ` local ' fluctuations in stress ( and its redistribution ) and renders the model as a mean - field one .",

    "are taken as model seismic activity variations in such two - fractal overlap model of earthquake .",
    "the overlap size distribution was argued @xcite and shown @xcite to follow power law decay .",
    "we showed numerically ( see section 4 ) that if one fixes a magnitude @xmath173 of the overlap sizes @xmath126 , so that overlaps with @xmath174 are called ` events ' ( or earthquake ) , then the cumulative overlap @xmath175 , @xmath176 @xmath177 , ( where two successive events of @xmath174 occur at times @xmath149 and @xmath144 ) grows linearly with time up to some discrete quanta @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the minimal overlap quantum , dependent on @xmath173 and @xmath180 ( the generation number ) . here",
    "@xmath181 is an integer ( see figs .",
    "10 , 11 ) @xcite .",
    "although our results here are for regular fractals of finite generation @xmath180 , the observed discretisation of the overlap cumulant @xmath150 with the time limit set by @xmath180 , is a robust feature and can be seen for larger time series for larger generation number @xmath180 .",
    "this part of the model study therefore indicates that one can note the growth of the cumulant seismic response @xmath182 , rather than the seismic event strength @xmath119 , and anticipate some big events as the response reaches the discrete levels @xmath157 , specific to the series of events .",
    "some prior knowledge of the precursors and their precise behavior ( power laws etc . ) , as discussed here for three different kinds of failure models of cooperatively interacting dynamical systems which are prone to major failures , are therefore plausible .",
    "these precursor responses should help estimating the location of the global failure or critical point using proper extrapolation of the above quantities , which are available long before the failure occurs .",
    "the usefulness of such precursors can hardly be overemphasized .",
