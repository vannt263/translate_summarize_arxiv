    "these models with gap - sparking provide a good framework to analyze observational phenomena , especially the drifting  @xcite and bi - drifting  @xcite sub - pulses .    however , the rs75-like vacuum gap models work only in strict conditions : strong magnetic field and low temperature on surface of pulsars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this binding energy problem could be solved within a partially screened inner gap model  @xcite for normal neutron stars .",
    "alternatively , it is noted that the binding energy could be sufficiently high if pulsars are bare strange quark stars  @xcite although strange stars were previously supposed to exist with crusts  @xcite .",
    "certainly , it is very meaningful in the elementary strong interaction between quarks and the phases of cold quark matter that the binding energy problem could be solved by bare quark stars as pulsars  @xcite .",

    "our research results are that multi - accelerators could occur above the polar cap for ( and only for ) the curvature - radiation - induced ( cr - induced ) sparking normal pulsars ( nps ) , but for other cases , such as resonant inverse - compton - scattering - induced ( ics - induced ) sparking nps and both cr - induced and ics - induced millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , particles on surface of bsss are bound strongly enough to form vacuum gap and rs75-like models work well if pulsars are bsss .",

    "the second scenario is based on the idea that if particles with opposite charge stream into the magnetosphere with @xmath27 in both regions , areas of this two regions should approximately be equal in order to keep the star not charging .",

    "( 2 ) the so - called aliasing effect : as one observes subpulses only once every rotation period , we can hardly determine their actual speed .",
    "the main obstacles in the aliasing problem are the under sampling of subpulse motion and our inability to distinguish between subpulses especially when the differences between subpulses formed by various subbeams are smaller than the fluctuations in subpulses from one single subbeam  @xcite .",
