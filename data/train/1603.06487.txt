    "the long - standing quest for a solid state realization of the kitaev honeycomb model@xcite has triggered much of the experimental and theoretical interest in 4d and 5d compounds with two- and three - dimensional tri - coordinated lattices , in which the interplay of the strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and electronic correlations leads to the dominance of the strongly anisotropic kitaev - like interactions.@xcite a lot of experimental effort has been focused on iridium oxides belonging to the a@xmath0iro@xmath1 family@xcite and , more recently , to @xmath2rucl@xmath1.@xcite    the kitaev honeycomb model belongs to the class of the compass models .",
    "it is intrinsically frustrated due to the bond - depended nature of the interactions . in the quantum case",
    ", this frustration leads to the appearance of the non - trivial quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) phase with fractionalized excitations , dubbed kitaev qsl.@xcite kitaev qsl is not a unique example of non - trivial ground states of the compass models , @xcite however , it is probably the only one which allows an exact analytic solution",
    ".    in honeycomb iridates and ruthenates , the magnetic degree of freedom described by an effective magnetic moment @xmath5 , arises in the presence of strong soc from electrons occupying @xmath6-manifold of states of ir@xmath7 and ru@xmath8 ions . in a@xmath0iro@xmath1 compounds ,",
    "edge - shared iro@xmath9 octahedra provide 90@xmath10 paths for the dominant nearest neighbor kitaev coupling between iridium magnetic moments .",
    "a similar situation takes place in the isostructural layered honeycomb material @xmath2rucl@xmath1 and three - dimensional harmonic honeycomb iridates , @xmath11li@xmath0iro@xmath1 and @xmath12li@xmath0iro@xmath1.@xcite it is believed that the sign of the kitaev interaction may be either antiferro- ( af ) or ferromagnetic ( fm ) depending on the compound.@xcite isotropic heisenberg couplings are also present in these compounds due to the octachedra edge sharing geometry and direct overlap of @xmath13 or @xmath14orbitals which , due to their extended nature , often reach beyond nearest neighbors .",
    "further anisotropies , such as the isotropic off - diagonal @xmath3 interactions , can also be present , mainly as a result of crystal field distortions .",
    "@xcite the competition between all these couplings leads to a rich variety of experimentally observed magnetic structures.@xcite    here we discuss in detail the models and the mechanisms which lead to the stabilization of magnetic ordering in two compounds : na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and @xmath2rucl@xmath1 .",
    "several experiments have shown that the low - temperature phase of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 has collinear zigzag long - range magnetic order.@xcite in addition , recent diffuse magnetic x - ray scattering data have determined the spin orientation in this zigzag state and showed that it is along the 44.3@xmath15 direction with respect to the @xmath16 axis , which corresponds to approximately half way in between the cubic @xmath17 and @xmath18 axes.@xcite both of these findings are in disagreement with the original kitaev - heisenberg model,@xcite which predicts the zigzag phase only for the antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor kitaev interaction with the magnetic moments along the cubic axes , while the kitaev interaction in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is ferromagnetic.@xcite this shows that one needs to extend the nearest neighbor model by including some additional interactions in order to explain these experimental observations .",
    "@xmath2rucl@xmath1 also shows collinear antiferromagnetic zigzag ground state.@xcite recent x - ray and neutron scattering diffraction data@xcite indicate that the best fit to the collinear structure is obtained for the antiferromagnetic nearest neighbor kitaev interaction and when the spin direction points 35@xmath15 out of the @xmath19-plane , i.e. along one of the cubic directions .",
    "this suggests that the microscopic origin of the zigzag ground state in @xmath2rucl@xmath1 might be quite different from the one in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , and that it can be described by the nearest neighbor kitaev - heisenberg model.@xcite    in both cases , the available experimental data provides an important check of the validity of any model proposed to describe the magnetic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1 and @xmath2rucl@xmath1 , as it should correctly predict not only the type of the magnetic order but also its orientation in space .    in this work",
    "we consider two models , the nearest neighbor kitaev - heisenberg model@xcite and its more complicated counterpart , dubbed @xmath4 model,@xcite and study how the preferred directions of the mean field order parameter are selected in these models .",
    "the formal procedure which we will be using here is based on the derivation of the fluctuational part of the free energy by integrating out the leading thermal fluctuations , and by determining which orientations of the order parameter correspond to the free energy minimum .",
    "this approach is based on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation and was outlined in refs.@xcite to which we refer the reader for technical details . in both models , the thermal fluctuations select the cubic axes as the preferred directions for spins , which describes the experimental situation in @xmath2rucl@xmath1 but not in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "we have also checked that in both models the quantum fluctuations ( taken into account either using the quantum version of hubbard - stratonovich approach or within the semiclassical spin - wave approach ) lift the accidental degeneracy of the classical solution and also select the cubic axes as the preferred directions for spins .",
    "we did not present these calculations here as they bring no new results compared with more simple analysis of thermal fluctuations .    the important point which we stress in our paper",
    "is that the selection of correct `` diagonal '' direction of the spins observed in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 might happen already on the mean - field level by inclusion of small off - diagonal positive interaction @xmath3 as soon as it is larger than the energy gain of order @xmath20 due to the quantum fluctuations .",

    "the latter two magnetic states have a four sublattice structure .",

    "while the classical degeneracy of the simple fm state and of the af nel state comes straightforwardly from the infinite number of degenerate collinear states , the macroscopic degeneracy of the af stripy and zigzag phases is more complex , and the degenerate ground state manifold consists of six collinear states and a set of non - collinear multi-@xmath33 states . in appendix",
    "a we discuss this question in detail and show that using the four - sublattice klein transformation for the stripy and the zigzag af states,@xcite the nature of the classical degeneracy of all four magnetically ordered states can be understood in a similar way .",
    "importantly , in all cases , the classical degeneracy is accidental and is removed by the order by disorder mechanism which selects a set of collinear states , each with a particular direction of the order parameter .",
    "following chaloupka _",
    "et al_,@xcite we introduce four auxiliary sublattices a , b , c and d ( see fig.2 ) , fix the direction of the spins on the sublattice a and rotate the spins on the subllatices b , c , and d such that the component of spin corresponding to the bond direction ( @xmath17 for b , @xmath18 for c and @xmath34 for d ) stays the same but two other spin components change sign .",
    "this results in the transformed hamiltonian with the same form as ( [ kh ] ) but with transformed couplings .",
    "here we consider the kitaev - heisenberg model in the full parameter space .",
    "for the parameters of the model for which either stripy or zigzag are the ground states , we perform four - sublattice transformation and treat the model ( [ kh ] ) in the rotated basis , in which the stripy order maps to the fm and the zigzag order maps to the simple two - sublattice afm nel state .    next , using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation of the partition function,@xcite we discuss how the preferred directions of the order parameter in all these phases are selected by thermal below the ordering temperature .",
    "the partition function of the system of classical spins is given by the integral over the boltzmann weights of the configurations @xmath35[d\\mathbf{s}_{1,j}\\right]\\delta(\\mathbf{s}_{0,i}^{2}-1)\\delta(\\mathbf{s}_{1,j}^{2}-1)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\exp\\left[-\\beta\\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle_\\alpha}\\sum_{\\gamma}j^{\\alpha\\gamma}s_{0,i}^{\\gamma } s_{1,j}^{\\gamma}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are classical spins on sublattices @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the inverse temperature . similarly in the case of a quantum system the partition function is a trace of the boltzman weights over the spin operators , @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "+ it is more convenient to perform the hubbard - stratonovich transformation by representing the hamiltonian matrix in the basis of the eigenfunctions of the exchange matrix , which can be easily obtained in the momentum space . to this end , we first introduce a six - component vector @xmath42 , with the components given by the fourier transforms of the @xmath43 components of the spins on @xmath44 and @xmath45sublattices , correspondingly .",
    "this allows us to write the hamiltonian matrix in the momentum space as @xmath46where the @xmath47 exchange matrix @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 with matrix elements given by @xmath50 e^{\\imath{\\bm q}\\cdot ( { \\bm d } _ { \\alpha } -{\\bm d } _ { z } ) } = j_{{\\bm q}}+k_{\\bm q}^{\\gamma}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we drop the overall phase factor @xmath51 and denote @xmath52 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the lattice vectors .",

    "the importance of additional nearest neighbor @xmath77-symmetric anisotropic terms ( @xmath3-terms)@xcite or of the spatial anisotropy of the nearest neighbor kitaev interactions,@xcite were also discussed in the literature as a possible source for the stabilization of the zigzag phase .",

    "moreover , the @xmath89-@xmath88 model , that only includes kitaev interactions,@xcite already stabilizes the zigzag phase for the proper signs of @xmath89 and @xmath88 .",
    "however , as we have discussed in ref.@xcite , the @xmath89-@xmath88 model is still not sufficient to comply with all available experimental data .",
    "the classical degeneracy of the zigzag state obtained within the @xmath4 model with fm @xmath89 is different from the one of the zigzag state realized in the extended kitaev - heisenberg model with afm @xmath89 interaction . to see what difference the sign of @xmath89 makes ,",
    "let us consider the zigzag pattern in fig.[fig : orders ] ( d ) . with afm @xmath89 , the pattern , that minimizes the classical energy in the zigzag state with ferromagnegnetic @xmath18 and @xmath34 bonds , has the spins pointing along the @xmath90axis to take advantage of the kitaev interaction on the afm @xmath17-bonds .",

    "furthermore , when the klein duality 4-sublattice transformation@xcite is applied to the @xmath4 zigzags , these states do not turn into nel afm state , and instead turn into non - collinear states , that are more difficult to work with than the original zigzag states . working with",

    "its matrix elements are given in appendix c. the fluctuations matrix @xmath97 is calculated as before according to equation ( [ amatrix ] ) , with the constraint matrix @xmath98 of equation ( [ constraint ] ) now containing 4 identical blocks instead of 2 .",

    "al.@xcite have established that spins point along a cubic axis , by calculating the fluctuational corrections as a function of @xmath3 , we can find an upper bound on its value , such that the kitaev fluctuations dominate and keep the cubic axes as the preferred directions . from our calculations",
    "it follows that for @xmath126 mev and @xmath127 mev the upper bound for @xmath3 is about 0.8 mev .",
    "finally , for this set of parameters the transition to the 120@xmath10- afm order occurs around @xmath130 mev .",

    ", the kitaev interaction plays an important role . for the case of fm nearest neighbor kitaev interaction , like in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , farther neighbor interactions are essential for stabilizing the zigzag ground state . for the afm nearest neighbor kitaev interaction , which was widely suggested to be",
    "the dominant interaction in @xmath2rucl@xmath1,@xcite the zigzag order can be stabilized already within the nearest neighbor model .",
    "we proposed that the @xmath112 model can explain all the experimental finding in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . in this model",
    "the selection of the experimentally observed face diagonal direction of the order parameter happens already on the mean - field level due to the small bond - dependent anisotropic term @xmath3 .    in @xmath2rucl@xmath1 ,",
    "if the the nearest neighbor kitaev interaction is afm , the original kitaev - heisenberg model@xcite is sufficient to explain both the collinear zigzag ground state and the cubic directions of the order parameter .",
    "we studied the effect of the @xmath3-term and showed that while on the mean - field level it does nt affect the ground state degeneracy , it favors non - collinear 3-*q * states , instead of the experimentally observed zigzag state with spins along cubic axes , once the gaussian fluctuations are included .",
    "thus , it appears to be an upper bound for @xmath3-term , which can be estimated for a given set of nearest neighbor parameters .",

    "@xcite about the ordering in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 are in agreement with our findings , despite the fact that their estimates for @xmath88 suggest significantly smaller values than the ones that we obtained by including only the dominant superexchange processes between the second neighbors .",
    "the agreement holds because the second neighbor kitaev interaction @xmath88 and the third neighbor interaction @xmath131 favor the same type of afm zigzag ground state .    for @xmath2rucl@xmath1 , the authors of ref.@xcite suggest ( _ i _ ) that there may be possible variations of in - plane interactions due to lattice distortions , and ( _ ii _ ) that the nearest neighbor kitaev interaction may be fm and",
    "the third neighbor coupling @xmath131 may be large and afm .",
    "the fm sign of the nearest neighbor kitaev interaction was also suggested by yadav _",

    "in this appendix we provide detailed discussion of the classical degeneracy of the extended kitaev - heisenberg model at parameters for which either the stripy or the zigzag af phases are realized as the ground state and the manifold of classically degenerate states is rather complex .    to be specific ,",
    "let us first consider the stripy phase .",
    "it contains six inequivalent collinear stripy states with fm bonds along either kitaev @xmath90 , @xmath91 or @xmath92bonds .",
    "it also contains infinite number of non - collinear ( coplanar and non - coplanar ) states .",
    "the spin order in the @xmath90 , @xmath91 or @xmath92 stripy states can be described either with a help of four magnetic sublattices or by a simple spiral characterized by a single-@xmath33 wave vector : @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "one of the stripy states with fm @xmath34-bonds is shown in fig.1 ( c ) . in each of these stripy states the spins",
    "are aligned along one of the cubic directions which is locked to the spatial orientation of a stripy pattern by the kitaev interaction , i.e. the direction of the order parameter is defined by the wave vector @xmath135 or @xmath136 determining the breaking of the translation symmetry .    the structure of the manifold of the non - collinear states , which looks rather complex in the original model , can be easily understood with the help of the four - sublattice transformation ( see fig.2 ) based on the klein duality.@xcite in the new rotated basis , the stripy phase is mapped to the fm order with a unique ordering vector @xmath137 .",
    "classically , all states with arbitrary direction of the fm order have the same energy .",
    "fm states with order parameter along the cubic axes give the six stripy phases in the unrotated spin basis discussed above .",
    "arbitrary directions of the fm order parameter lead to a set of non - coplanar states in which each component of spin , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , transforms with its own @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath136 wavevector , which coincide with the @xmath143 vectors describing the spatial orientation of the stripes in the respective collinear states .    using these three ordering vectors",
    ", we can write the non - coplanar phase of the unrotated spins as @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the fm order parameter . @xmath147 denote the spins on the sublattice @xmath38 and the spins on the sublattice @xmath39 are obtained from @xmath147 by a constant phase shift coming from the spin rotation on that bond as prescribed by the four sublattice transformation . as in fig.1 ( c ) , the sublattices 0 and 1 are connected by the @xmath34 bond , the order of the spins on the subllatice 1 is given by @xmath148    in the zigzag phase , the structure of the classical states manifold is very similar to the stripy phase .",
    "the four - sublattice transformation maps the zigzag phase onto the nel af phase .",
    "the generic state is again described by the three-@xmath143 spiral state .",
    "the only difference is that the spins on sublattice 1 have an overall phase factor of @xmath149 , @xmath150 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath97 can be written as @xmath151 where a repeated index implies a summation over .",
    "the first term in ( [ amatrix ] ) is the contribution from the interaction term and the second term is from the constraint term.@xcite for convenience , the constraint matrix @xmath152 can be first written in the original basis , in which the interaction term is not diagonal , and then transformed to the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian with a help of the unitary transformation @xmath153 . in the original basis",
    "the constraint matrix @xmath152 consists of two blocks , one for each sublattice .",
    "the a - sublattice block has elements @xmath154 with @xmath155 and the b - sublattice block has the elements with @xmath156 .",
