    "in the early 20th century , theodor kaluza and oskar klein attempted to unify the forces of electromagnetism and gravitation into a more fundamental description of nature by introducing extra dimensions into general relativity @xcite . since the onset of kaluza - klein theory , the notion of incorporating extra dimensions into general relativity has remained as a potentially viable alternative to traditional four dimensional ( 4d ) theories in accounting for various physical phenomena .",
    "this addition of extra dimensions into physical theory has been more actively pursued in the last several decades ( for a review , see applequist , chodos , and frend @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of string theory as a possible candidate to offer a consistent quantum description of gravity has been primarily responsible for fueling this activity in the research of extra dimensional scenarios as superstring theory has the strict requirement of residing in a 10d spacetime .",
    "traditionally , the six extra spatial dimensions predicted by string theory have been treated as compactified objects , as are the dimensions of kaluza - klein theory .",
    "the discovery of d(irichlet)-branes as fundamental extended objects has provided a new possible explanation for the hidden extra spatial dimensions and has given rise to several different braneworld scenarios where the extra dimensions are large @xcite .",
    "recent observations of type ia supernovae @xcite and measurements of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background @xcite indicate that our universe is , on the largest of scales , spatially flat , homogeneous , isotropic , and currently undergoing accelerated expansion .",
    "this late - time epoch of accelerated expansion can be explained within the framework of the 4d standard model of cosmology by hypothesizing a dark energy component to the total energy density of the universe .",
    "this dark energy is characterized by a negative pressure equation of state @xmath1 , where the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0 lies near @xmath2 .",
    "dark energy can possibly be understood as arising from quantum fluctuations of the vacuum .",
    "if this vacuum energy does in fact exist , it would dominate over radiation and matter in the late universe and seems to be a perfect candidate for dark energy .",
    "quantum theory , however , predicts a value far different from that which is observed @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency between theory and observation is known as the cosmological constant problem and remains as one of the greatest problems in theoretical physics today .",
    "a universe that is characterized to be spatially flat , homogeneous , and isotropic can be neatly explained through the phenomenon of early - time inflation @xcite .",
    "single field inflationary theory is characterized by an early - time accelerated expansion that is driven by a spatially uniform scalar field .",
    "this scalar field is characterized by having a negative pressure when the scalar field  slowly rolls \" down a potential energy curve .",
    "this slow roll allows the potential energy term to dominate over the kinetic energy term and gives rise to the required negative pressure , if one is to demand an epoch of accelerated expansion .",
    "the end of this early - time inflationary epoch is reached when the slow - roll conditions are violated and is followed by an epoch of reheating .",
    "scalar field inflationary theory is incomplete , however , as the potential energy function is left undetermined by the theory .",
    "in addition to this shortcoming , observational evidence of the existence of a fundamental scalar particle is nonexistent , although the search is on for the elusive higgs boson !",
    "mohammedi offered an alternative explanation to dark energy being responsible for driving the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe by incorporating extra dimensions into friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology @xcite .",
    "there he considered the einstein field equations in @xmath3 spacetime dimensions subjected to a flat , anisotropic robertson - walker metric , where the 3d scale factor is allowed to evolve at a rate different from that of the scale factor of the higher - dimensional space . by assuming that the higher - dimensional scale factor dynamically evolves at a rate inversely proportional to a power of the 3d scale factor",
    ", mohammedi showed that the @xmath4-dimensional frw equations reduce precisely to a 4d form , once an _ effective pressure _ is defined .",
    "this effective pressure is a linear combination of the density and the 3d and higher - dimensional pressures .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that this effective pressure can be negative for positive values of the density and the pressures and can drive the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe , without the need for dark energy .",
    "the work of @xcite has been extended and studied in @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned findings of @xcite were reached on the assumption of dynamical compactification of an inverse power law form",
    ". it would be intriguing if this specific form of dynamical compactification arises naturally from a general treatment of the higher - dimensional frw equations .    here , we consider the five - dimensional einstein field equations subjected to an anisotropic robertson - walker metric , where the scale factor for the 3d spatial manifold is allowed to evolve at a rate different , in general , from that of the scale factor of the extra dimension .",
    "we additionally assume that the matter - energy content of the 5d universe is that of a perfect fluid , where the pressure in the extra dimension is allowed to be different from that of the pressure of the 3d space . within this framework",
    ", we arrive at an underdetermined system of coupled differential equations .",
    "this is exactly like that of 4d frw cosmology where the variables are left underdetermined by the field equations and one usually chooses an equation of state to proceed . by adopting two equations of state , each relating the 3d and higher - dimensional pressures to the density",
    ", we obtain an exact expression relating the higher - dimensional scale factor to a function of the 3d scale factor and two arbitrary integration constants .",
    "surprisingly , when one of the integration constants is set equal to zero , a generalized case of the dynamical compactification scenario of mohammedi @xcite is found and represents a special case of the general treatment .",
    "the aforementioned expression relating the higher - dimensional scale factor to the 3d scale factor allows us to write the 5d frw field equations exclusively in terms of the 3d scale factor and we arrive at a set of decoupled 4d effective frw field equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we subject the 5d einstein field equations to a flat , anisotropic robertson - walker metric . by adopting two equations of state ,",
    "we arrive at an expression for the higher - dimensional scale factor as a function of the 3d scale factor . in sec .",
    "iii , we write the frw field equations exclusively in terms of the 3d scale factor and hence arrive at a set of 4d effective frw field equations . in sec .",
    "iv , we find an exact expression relating a function of the 3d scale factor to the time .",
    "we expand this exact expression in two different limiting regimes and obtain the approximate solutions corresponding to that of a generalized treatment of the case of dynamical compactification of mohammedi @xcite and to the 5d vacuum solution of chodos and detweiler @xcite .",
    "we then expand the hypergeometric function near a branch point and obtain a perturbative solution for the 3d scale factor in the small time regime .",
    "we then show that this early - time solution exhibits accelerated expansion . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results .",
    "we begin with the einstein field equations in five dimensions of the form [ field ] g_a^b=| t_a^b , where @xmath5 are indices which run over all spacetime dimensions . in this manuscript",
    ", we set the higher - dimensional coupling constant equal to one , @xmath6 .",
    "the higher - dimensional stress - energy tensor will be assumed to be that of a perfect fluid and of the form [ stress ]",
    "t_a ^ b= , where @xmath7 is the pressure in the extra dimension . as is obvious from ( [ stress ] ) , we are allowing the pressure in the extra dimension to be different , in general , from the pressure in the 3d space .",
    "hence , this stress - energy tensor describes a homogeneous , anisotropic perfect fluid in five dimensions .",
    "we choose a metric ansatz of the form [ metric ] s^2 = - dt^2 + a^2(t)+ b^2(t)dy^2 where we allow the scale factor of the extra dimension , @xmath8 , to evolve at a different rate , in general , than the 3d scale factor , @xmath9 .",
    "this metric ansatz describes a flat , homogeneous and isotropic 3d space and a flat extra dimension .",
    "notice that ( [ stress ] ) and ( [ metric ] ) encompass the main assumptions of this manuscript .    by adopting the above metric ansatz and the perfect fluid stress - energy tensor , the 5d friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) field equations and the 5d conservation equation are of the form & = & 3 + 3[density ] + p&=&- [ pres ] + p_5&=&- 3 ( + ) [ presd ] + 0&=&+3(+p)+(+p_5),[cons ] where a dot denotes a time derivative .",
    "one can easily show that the conservation equation , ( [ cons ] ) , is in fact satisfied when ( [ density ] ) - ( [ presd ] ) are employed .",
    "hence , the physical variables of the field equations , for general density and pressures , are left underdetermined as we have three unique equations and five unknowns .",
    "this is analogous to standard 4d frw cosmology where one usually adopts an eos relating the density to the pressure to proceed . here",
    ", we adopt two equations of state of the form p&=&w[eos ] + p_5&=&v,[eosd ] thus relating the 3d and higher - dimensional pressures to the density . notice that the eos parameters @xmath0 and @xmath10 can in general be time - dependent , in this manuscript they are simply treated as constants . employing ( [ eos ] ) and ( [ eosd ] ) to eliminate @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 from ( [ density ] ) - ( [ presd ] ) and performing some algebra , we obtain an exact differential equation of the form [ diff ] = 0 , where we defined the parameter [ n ] n. notice that when the eos parameters @xmath0 and @xmath10 are set equal to each other , the above parameter is negative and takes on the value @xmath14 .    equation ( [ diff ] ) can be integrated twice , and remarkably , the scale factors can be decoupled . performing the aforementioned integrations ,",
    "one finds a relation for the higher - dimensional scale factor in terms of the 3d scale factor of the form    [ bfuna ] b(t)= , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary constants of integration .",
    "it should be emphasized that ( [ bfuna ] ) is an exact expression .",
    "notice that if the arbitrary integration constant @xmath15 is set equal to zero , we obtain the dynamical compactification scenario of mohammedi @xcite where , there , @xmath17 was an arbitrary power that was held positive . here",
    ", dynamical compactification emerges naturally as a special case of an exact treatment with the value of @xmath17 determined by the eos parameters @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "the discovery of ( [ bfuna ] ) allows us to decouple the 5d frw equations and obtain a set of differential equations written exclusively in terms of the 3d scale factor . in the next section , we arrive at this set of 4d effective frw field equations .",
    "now that we have an expression for the higher - dimensional scale factor @xmath8 in terms of the 3d scale factor @xmath9 , we can write the frw field equations exclusively in terms of the 3d scale factor . after performing some algebra",
    ", we find that ( [ density ] ) - ( [ cons ] ) can be written in the form & = & _ 1 + 3[rho0 ] + p&=&_2+(_1-_2 ^ 2)-(_1 + 2_2)[p0 ] + p_5&=&-3(+)[pd0 ] + 0&=&+3(1+w - n(1+v))+(1+v),[cons0 ] where we defined the coefficients _ 1&&3(1-n)[eta1 ] + _ 2&&(n-2)[eta2 ] , where @xmath17 was defined in ( [ n ] ) .",
    "we also defined the higher - dimensional volume element , @xmath18 , as [ volume ] x(t)a^3b = a(t)^(3-n ) , where we used ( [ bfuna ] ) to express the volume element solely in terms of @xmath9 . as a check of the 4d effective field equations",
    ", one can solve ( [ rho0 ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) for @xmath19 and @xmath20 in terms of the density , pressure , and the higher - dimensional volume element and then substitute these expressions into ( [ pd0 ] ) . using ( [ eos ] ) and ( [ eosd ] ) and performing some algebra , one can in fact verify that ( [ pd0 ] ) is a redundant equation , as should be expected .    as in 4d frw cosmology",
    ", the 5d conservation equation yields an expression for the density as a function of the 3d scale factor . integrating ( [ cons ] ) and then employing ( [ bfuna ] ) and ( [ volume ] )",
    ", we find an expression for the density of the form [ rhofuna ] ( a)=_0 , where @xmath21 is a constant of integration .",

    "this special case equates to the first law of thermodynamics for cosmology in 4d .",
    "hence , when @xmath23 , the dynamical evolution of the density is independent of the extra dimension .    in obtaining the 4d effective field equations of the form ( [ rho0 ] ) - ( [ pd0 ] ) , we used the fact that [ hubble ] = -n+ .",
    "this expression relates the higher - dimensional hubble parameter to the 3d hubble parameter and the higher - dimensional volume element .",
    "notice that the higher - dimensional hubble parameter can change signs with the sign dependent on whether the 4d hubble parameter or the inverse of the higher - dimensional volume element dominates , assuming @xmath15 is positive .    by defining an _ effective _ eos parameter @xmath24 to be of the form [ effw ] w - n(1+v ) , the 5d conservation equation , ( [ cons0 ] ) , reduces to a form that precisely mimics the 4d conservation equation when the integration constant @xmath15 is set equal to zero , with @xmath0 replaced by @xmath24 .",

    "when the second term on the right - hand side dominates , one obtains accelerated expansion when @xmath26 are of the same sign .",
    "these two scenarios emerge as limiting cases of a general treatment and will be discussed thoroughly in the appendix . in the next section ,",

    "<S> we examine the time evolution of the five - dimensional einstein field equations subjected to a flat , anisotropic robertson - walker metric , where the 3d and higher - dimensional scale factors are allowed to dynamically evolve at different rates . by adopting equations of state relating the 3d and higher - dimensional pressures to the density , we obtain an exact expression relating the higher - dimensional scale factor to a function of the 3d scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> this relation allows us to write the friedmann - robertson - walker field equations exclusively in terms of the 3d scale factor , thus yielding a set of 4d effective friedmann - robertson - walker field equations . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the effective field equations in the general case and obtain an exact expression relating a function of the 3d scale factor to the time . </S>",
    "<S> this expression involves a hypergeometric function and can not , in general , be inverted to yield an analytical expression for the 3d scale factor as a function of time . when the hypergeometric function is expanded for small and large arguments , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a generalized treatment of the dynamical compactification scenario of mohammedi [ phys.rev.d * 65 * , 104018 ( 2002 ) ] and the 5d vacuum solution of chodos and detweiler [ phys.rev.d * 21 * , 2167 ( 1980 ) ] , respectively . by expanding the hypergeometric function near a branch point </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the perturbative solution for the 3d scale factor in the small time regime . </S>",
    "<S> this solution exhibits accelerated expansion , which , remarkably , is independent of the value of the 4d equation of state parameter @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this early - time epoch of accelerated expansion arises naturally out of the anisotropic evolution of 5d spacetime when the pressure in the extra dimension is negative and offers a possible alternative to scalar field inflationary theory . </S>"
