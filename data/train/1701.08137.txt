    "the determination of accurate numerical solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation is an ongoing enterprise .",

    "a number of improvements have been made to yield more accurate solutions with greater efficiency .",
    "the type of method often depends on the problem at hand , i.e. , dimensionality , time dependence of the interaction , short- or long - time behaviour , etc .",
    "the  method of choice \" for some years is the chebyshev polynomial expansion of the time - evolution operator with ( inverse ) fourier transformations to deal with the spatial development as time progresses  @xcite .",
    "more recently the pad approximant representation of the time - evolution operator is exploited  @xcite .",
    "this approach is unitary , stable , and allows for systematic estimate of errors in terms of powers of the temporal and spatial step sizes .",

    "they deal with the more general problem of a time - dependent hamiltonian . using a truncated magnus expansion with additional transformations , they are able to obtain stable and efficient solutions which are accurate up to sixth - order in the time step .    generally the various approaches involve time evolution and integration over space .",
    "thus there are a number of ways of dealing with the time evolution .",
    "crank - nicolson approximates the exponential time - evolution operator by a cayley form which retains unitarity , but is correct only to low order in time advance  @xcite .",
    "the chebyshev polynomial expansion can lead to high accuracy even over significant time intervals .",
    "it is not explicitly unitary .",

    "besides these three approaches there are other approximations of the time - evolution operator , e.g. , the exponential split - operator method  @xcite or the iterative lanczos reduction  @xcite . like time development",
    "the spatial integration can be achieved in different ways , e.g. , by different types of finite differencing or by the pseudospectral fast fourier transform approach .",
    "since many of the calculations referred to have been done in one spatial dimension , in this paper we consider the generalized crank - nicolson with two spatial dimensions .",

    "the terms on the right side involving @xmath26 can be moved to the left side and one solves a linear system of equations upon the discretization of the spatial variables . however , as we show in the next section , the kinetic energy operators are banded diagonal matrices , and those operators raised to some power would result in matrices with the size of the bands increased . as a result the gains in efficiency of a banded matrix formulation are lost .",
    "the numerical spatial integration of the partial differential equation  ( [ eq:2.17 ] ) can be done in a number of ways .",
    "two approaches often considered are the spectral decomposition of the spatial ( kinetic energy ) operator or the finite - difference representation of this operator .",
    "the relative merits are discussed by the authors of ref .",
    "they point out that alow - order differencing method is in principle faster than a spectral method since it scales as the bandedness times the size of the grid , @xmath53 , rather than as @xmath54 \" . in the case of two - dimensional systems using the alternating - direction implicit approach @xmath55",
    "is replaced by @xmath56 , whereas @xmath57 is unchanged . for the purpose of this work we therefore use finite differences .",
    "one could choose the traditional three - point expression for the second - order partial derivative .",
    "there are however more precise methods .",
    "for instance the recent numerov recent approach  @xcite gives much higher accuracy , as does the high - order compact finite difference approach in refs .",
    "the traditional approach is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the spatial step size , whereas the high - order compact method is @xmath60 , and the numerov algorithm is @xmath61 .",
    "the advantage of these approaches is that they lead to three - point formulas which may be convenient when crossing a discontinuity of the potential or considering an adaptive spatial grid  @xcite .    as in earlier work",
    "@xcite we consider formulas which allows one to choose an arbitrary order of @xmath59 . for a spatial grid ( in one dimension ) with step size @xmath59 , the second derivative of @xmath62 is expanded as @xmath63 where the @xmath64 are real constants , obtained from making series expansions of the functions @xmath65 .",
    "a similar technique is used by wang and shao for the kinetic energy operator acting on the wave function of a two - dimensional stationary state problem  @xcite . in another article",

    "it can be solved for each @xmath87 to obtain @xmath85 .",
    "it is the strength of the alternating - direction implicit scheme that calculations are reduced to one - dimensional ones .",
    "in this section we consider four examples in which the method outlined previously is applied in order to investigate its accuracy and efficiency .",
    "we will also demonstrate the feasibility of calculating wave functions with more complex structure ( several peaks and valleys ) as they evolve in time .",
    "the truncation error of the series expansion of the wave function in time and space can be expressed as @xmath88 where we are considering the error of the real quantity @xmath89 and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are real positive numbers related to the @xmath92th partial derivative with respect to @xmath93 and the @xmath94th derivative with respect to @xmath8 or @xmath9 , respectively . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath95 and a @xmath96 symmetry of the wave function .",
    "if exact analytic solutions are available the error can be calculated by comparison .",
    "if that is not the case , a good estimate of the error can be made by comparing the solution for particular @xmath1 and @xmath68 to the one obtained when one or both of the @xmath1 and @xmath68 are increased by unity  @xcite .    to make comparisons of the numerically obtained solutions to analytic solutions in cases where the latter are known , we define the error @xmath97 such that @xmath98 the error @xmath97 , which is a euclidean/@xmath99-vector norm , is a measure of the accuracy of the wave function and its phase .",
    "alternatively some authors have used the @xmath100-vector norm @xmath101 in the case that no exact solution is available , one can make an estimate of the error by comparing a solution obtained with particular values of @xmath1 and @xmath68 to the solution obtained with @xmath102 and @xmath103 , e.g. , @xmath104 since it turns out that @xmath97 and @xmath105 are very similar , evaluating @xmath105 provides a method to estimate the accuracy in the absence of an analytic solution  @xcite .",
    "since in our applications the wave functions are zero near the boundary of the domain , we can use the simple rectangle rule for integration .",
    "the corrections to higher order polynomial approximations are all in terms of evaluations of the integrand near the end points , but since the wave function is zero there , one gets very accurate integrals with the simple quadrature  @xcite .",

    "when @xmath120 the results are identical to those of @xmath121 . given that earlier calculations referred to are basically @xmath43 calculations with spatial errors of the order of @xmath122 or @xmath123 , this method results in significant improvement in accuracy .",
    "the errors of this example for @xmath124 saturate at @xmath125 . in the  gullies \" of potential ( [ eq:4.01b ] ) the magnitude of the wave function is larger than elsewhere . in the gullies at the boundary of the computational space",
    "it is approximately @xmath126 .",
    "the numerical calculation assumes that the wave function is zero outside the computational domain .",
    "the discrepancy between the numerical wave function and the exact one outside the computational space is the source of the residual error .    in order to determine the efficiency of the calculation we obtain the cpu time when the error is close to , but less than , @xmath127 . for a particular @xmath1",
