[ fig2])@xcite . for zero magnetic field",
    "the electric polarization shows a sudden increase on heating above the afm transition temperature of dy , @xmath61 = 6.5 k. we have recently reported@xcite that this behavior is due to an enhancement of the electric polarization related to the mn - induced magnetic ordering of dy moments with propagation vector @xmath20 . from neutron diffraction",

    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the bragg reflection related to the individual dy ordering @xmath64 does vanish in an applied field of 20  koe .",
    "simultaneously , another reflection with @xmath69 appears .",
    "this value coincides with the abovementioned mn - induced dy ordering with @xmath20 .",
    "we conclude that the field - induced suppression of the @xmath64 ordering is accompanied by a re - emergence of the mn - induced ordering and is directly linked to the field - induced increase of the electric polarization below 6.5  k at 20 and 30  koe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .    from the magnetic field dependence of the ( 0  2+@xmath70  0 ) reflection intensity at base temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) we obtain a critical field of 18  koe for the transition of the dy ordering from @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "the bragg reflection related to @xmath72 has its maximum intensity around 20  koe and decreases rapidly for larger fields .",
    "thus the mn - induced ordering of dy is gradually suppressed for magnetic fields above 20  koe . above 40  koe",
    "the intensity levels off , probably marking a second transition .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the position of the ( 0  2+@xmath20  0 ) reflection does not vary significantly with the strength of the applied magnetic field ( not shown ) , which implies that the mn propagation vector is field - independent , similar to the behavior reported for @xmath11.@xcite    these observations confirm that the first metamagnetic step in the magnetization data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is indeed related to a breakdown of the independent dy ordering . above this transition , however , the dy moments still carry an antiferromagnetic ( af ) modulation with the same propagation vector as the mn - induced ordering .",
    "the magnetization can only be saturated ( forced ferromagnetic alignment ) when this modulation is also suppressed .",
    "this point is reached above the second transition at @xmath73  koe .",
    "it is worth noting that this field value is close to the polarization flop transition from @xmath13 to @xmath74 observed for @xmath75  koe.@xcite    it is also interesting to compare the magnetic field dependence of the induced ordering ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) with the field dependence of the electric polarization ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . obviously , there is a direct correspondence between the intensity of the induced - ordering related bragg reflection and the magnitude of the electric polarization at 4.5 k. we performed a quantitative analysis based on the assumption that the @xmath76 and @xmath77 components of the mn - cycloid stay unchanged ( or change only slightly ) under application of a magnetic field .",
    "then the field - dependent electric polarization enhancement ( @xmath78 ) should be proportional to the size of the induced dy moment , justified by the model presented in our previous report.@xcite .",
    "since the related bragg intensity is proportional to the square of the induced moment , the square of the polarization enhancement should scale with the ( 0  2+@xmath20  0 ) bragg intensity . the experimental data ( solid circles in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) follow this scaling well except for @xmath79  koe .",
    "one possible explanation for the mismatch in this field - region is that the above assumption becomes invalid when approaching the flop of the electric polarization at @xmath80  koe , since this is related to changes on the mn - sublattice .    to complete the discussion of the xrms data on dymno@xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the temperature dependence of the ( 0  2+@xmath20  0 ) reflection in zero field and 20  koe together with the ( 0  2+@xmath70  0 ) reflection in zero field .",
    "we derive a zero - field transition temperature of 6.5  k for the dy ordering , consistent with our previous findings.@xcite interestingly , in an applied field of 20  koe , the intensity of the ( 0  2+@xmath20  0 ) reflection increases continuously on cooling . at 4.5",
    "k it reaches a value five times larger than at 10 k. we relate this intensity increase with the continuous increase of the electric polarization on cooling in a 20  koe field ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these data also follow roughly the expected scaling of the induced bragg peak intensity with the square of the electric polarization enhancement .",
    "in contrast to our previous report , we observe a residual intensity above @xmath81  k of the ( 0  2+@xmath20  0 ) reflection ( f - mode , @xmath82 even and @xmath83 even , in bertaut s notation ) in zero field in the present data ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , which vanishes only above 36  k , i.e. , close to @xmath7 .",
    "we ascribe this apparent discrepancy to the different azimuth orientations in the two experiments , namely @xmath16 perpendicular to the scattering plane in the present , but @xmath16 parallel to the scattering plane in the previous experiment .",
    "since the xrms amplitude is a measure of the projection of the ordered moment onto the scattered beam , the present geometry highlights xrms from any @xmath84 component of the dy moment , which was suppressed in the previous experiment .",
    "thus , the present observation of residual ( 0  2+@xmath20  0 ) intensity above 18  k suggests that dy  besides the previously reported component of maximally 2.5  @xmath62 along the @xmath37 axis@xcite  carries a small induced moment component parallel to the @xmath84 axis above @xmath8 which , however , does not induce an electric polarization in that temperature range .",
    "similar observations have also been made by x - ray resonant scattering in tbmno@xmath0.@xcite    such a residual @xmath84 component may be also present at lowest @xmath19 in applied fields and thus account for the residual ( 0  2+@xmath20  0 ) intensity observed in the field - dependent data at @xmath79  koe ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , in such a picture it would be difficult to understand why the @xmath37 component of the induced moment  and with it the polarization enhancement  is suppressed by magnetic field @xmath1 but the @xmath84 component is not .",
    "for tbmno@xmath0 it has been argued that the residual mn - induced polarization of the tb in the paraelectric state solely resides on the tb 5@xmath85 orbitals and that 4@xmath86 states are not affected.@xcite therefore , such a contribution to the spin polarization may survive even when the 4@xmath86 ordering is suppressed .    to conclude the discussion of dymno@xmath0 , we have shown that for @xmath1 the intermediate field region with enhanced electric polarization for @xmath87  k is characterized the re - occurrence of an induced dy ordering with @xmath20 . only for fields large enough to fully suppress the afm arrangement of dy moments with @xmath20 , the enhancement of the electric polarization by the dy vanishes .",
    "all observations of the present magnetic - field dependent study confirm our previous conjecture@xcite that the mn - induced ordering of dy is responsible for any enhancement of the electric polarization in dymno@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to tb- and dymno@xmath0 , only very limited data on the magnetic ordering in gdmno@xmath0 have been reported so far .",
    "the only available information comes from xrd experiments , in which second - order bragg reflections from 2@xmath20 lattice modulations induced by magnetic ordering were studied.@xcite from these data it was deduced that the mn magnetic moments ordered incommensurately below @xmath88  k. below the lock - in temperature , @xmath89  k , the associated bragg reflections vanished .",
    "this was interpreted as a transition to a - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering of the mn ( @xmath90 ) , associated with weak ferromagnetism ( canted af ) .",
    "the application of a magnetic field @xmath39  koe along the @xmath37 axis at @xmath91  k lead to the appearance of new superstructure bragg reflections related to a propagation vector @xmath92 .",
    "this was explained as a field - induced change of the mn magnetic ordering from the canted af state to a moment stacking with @xmath93,@xcite associated with the transition to the ferroelectric phase .",
    "the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "the results discussed in the following , however , shed new light on the mn magnetic ordering and the magnetic origin of the ferroelectric phase .",
    "firstly , we present data taken in zero magnetic field to determine the gd magnetic ordering in the ground state and its temperature dependence . we will show that  in a certain temperature range  the mn - induced ordering of the gd moments can be used to track the mn propagation vector .",
    "secondly , we discuss in - field data that provide evidence that the phase boundaries of the ferroelectric phase and field - dependent magnetic phases of gd coincide .",
    "magnetic ordering of gd has been reported to occur below 6.5  k.@xcite nevertheless , no information on the gd ordering propagation vector have been reported yet .",
    "to study the ground - state gd magnetic ordering , we carried out a reciprocal space survey in zero field at @xmath94  k , using xrms close to the gd l@xmath48 edge .",
    "it reveals the presence only of a- and f - mode superstructure reflections ( 0  @xmath95  @xmath83 ) with @xmath96 , ( @xmath67 even and @xmath83 odd or even , respectively ) .",
    "polarization analysis shows that in @xmath97 geometry these reflections are suppressed , an indication of their magnetic character .",
    "variation of the x - ray energy through the gd l@xmath48 absorption edge proves their resonant character , with a strong resonant enhancement of the bragg intensity by a factor @xmath98 100 at the edge .",
    "we therefore associate these bragg reflections with a magnetic ordering of the gd moments with propagation vector @xmath96 .    in order to determine the orientation of the ordered gd moment ,",
    "we measured the azimuth dependence of the ( 0  3.75  0 ) reflection in zero field at 1.6  k. on rotation of the scattering plane from _ bc _ to _ ab _ , the integrated intensity of this reflection , normalized to the ( 0  4  0 ) reflection , is reduced down to @xmath99  % ( not shown ) .",
    "this indicates that in zero field the gd ordered moment _",
    "@xmath100 _ is principally aligned along the @xmath84 direction , consistent with magnetization measurements which show that @xmath84 is the easy magnetic axis for gd.@xcite the residual intensity observed for the scattering plane _ ab _ , however , is significantly larger than expected from the limited degree of polarization , since with the ( 0  4  0 ) reflection a @xmath101 cross - talk in the @xmath50 setting of only 3  % was determined .",
    "this observation points to an additional component of the gd moment perpendicular to @xmath84 at 1.6  k. taking into account the projection of the ordered moment onto the scattered beam ( @xmath102 ) , the residual intensity is consistent with @xmath103 or @xmath104 @xmath105 .",

    "interestingly , after a small decrease , its intensity shows a sudden increase by about 20% upon heating through @xmath19 * = 4.5  k. on further heating , the intensity drops rapidly , marking the gd ordering transition around @xmath106  k. similar temperature dependences have also been observed for other bragg reflections , like ( 0  1.75  3 ) and ( 0  2.25  4 ) ( not shown ) and ( 0  0.25  4 ) ( fig",

    "the _ lower _ transition ( at 5.1  k ) was assigned to gd ordering .",
    "our results , in contrast , suggest that the _ upper _ transition ( at 8.2  k ) is the one to be associated with gd ordering ( with slightly lower values for the transition temperatures in our sample ) . the lower transition is presumably related to a modification of the magnetically ordered structure .",

    "guided by the previous work on tb- and dymno@xmath0 , we associate the weak reflections observed above @xmath33 with the mn - induced ordering of the gd moment with the same propagation vector , @xmath20 .",
    "this suggests a mn - ordering propagation vector @xmath93 in the temperature range @xmath113 .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of @xmath20 is quite unusual , since the direction of the jump of @xmath20 from 0.16 to 0.25 on cooling through @xmath8 is opposite to the trend observed above that temperature .",
    "notably , lacking the present evidence for @xmath93 odering below @xmath8 , a simple a - type stacking of mn moments has been suggested previously for this @xmath19 region.@xcite based on the present results we can not exclude a coexistence of a - type with @xmath93 stacking , where both would be related to different crystallographic components of the mn magnetic moments .",

    "this azimuth dependence suggests that the intensity increase above @xmath19 * is associated with an increase of the @xmath37 component of the gd moment . for @xmath16",

    "[ fig8 ] , bottom ) indicates a vanishing gd order above a transition temperature of @xmath33(35  koe )  =  8.2  k.@xcite    we note that both the field - induced and temperature dependent transitions , observed for the gd magnetic ordering , coincide with the phase boundaries between the ferro- and the paraelectric phases of gdmno@xmath0 reported before.@xcite our data therefore suggest that a specific field - modified gd moment arrangement is related to the occurrence of ferroelectricity in gdmno@xmath0 .",
    "however , the comparison to the other ferroelectric members of the _ _",
    "r__mno@xmath0 series and recent theoretical results@xcite suggest that it is probably not the gd ordering but the mn that is responsible for the ferroelectricity in gdmno@xmath0 .",
    "previously , it has been argued that ferroelectricity in gdmno@xmath0 stems from a @xmath93 phase , analogous to the magnetic - field induced cycloidal @xmath120 phase in tbmno@xmath0 that also exhibits a ferroelectric polarization @xmath14.@xcite in this picture , the field - induced ferroelectricity in gdmno@xmath0 would indicate a modification of the mn magnetic ordering , in addition to the observed change of the gd ordering , in applied field .",
    "unfortunately , no detailed information on the mn magnetic ordering in the ferroelectric phase is available .",
    "the previous results on tb- and dymno@xmath0 suggest a significant interplay between the rare earth and the mn magnetism .",
    "therefore , we suggest the following scenario for gdmno@xmath0 .",
    "the incommensurate mn ordering , @xmath121  0.16 observed below @xmath7 is a simple spin - density wave ( sdw ) that locks - in with a first - order transition at @xmath8 to give @xmath93 .",
    "the latter phase is probably still a sdw , i.e. , not cycloidal .",
    "on cooling through the gd ordering transition , between @xmath33 and @xmath19 * a cycloid on the mn appears briefly , most probably with @xmath122 .",
    "however , it is unstable and disappears again below @xmath19*. when a magnetic field @xmath39  koe along @xmath37 is applied , another gd moment stacking is realized .",
    "we speculate that this stacking might stabilize a cycloidal ordering of the mn moments , leading to the observed ferroelectricity in gdmno@xmath0 .",
    "in such a scenario , the gd magnetic ordering would be very important for stabilizing the ferroelectric phase of gdmno@xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that the rare earth ions play an important role in determining the ferroelectric properties of dymno@xmath0 and ( most probably also of ) gdmno@xmath0 . in dymno@xmath0",
    "we find a mn - induced incommensurate magnetic ordering of dy which leads to an enhancement of the ferroelectric polarization by a factor of up to three .",
    "this polarization is suppressed in zero magnetic field by the individual ordering of dy moments with @xmath64 , below @xmath61 .",
    "application of a magnetic field @xmath1 below @xmath61 destroys the commensurate phase .",
    "this leads to a re - emergence of the mn - induced ordering and a concomitant strong enhancement of the ferroelectric polarization . in gdmno@xmath0 ,",
    "the magnetic - field induced ferroelectric phase for @xmath11 is associated with a specific ordering of the gd moments with @xmath123 . presumably , this ordering stabilizes a cycloidal mn ordering , which in turn produces an electric polarization analogous to the magnetic - field induced @xmath20=  @xmath124 phase in tbmno@xmath0 .",
    "thus , it turns out that for a full understanding of ferroelectricity in the rare earth manganites an understanding of the rare earth magnetism is very important .",
