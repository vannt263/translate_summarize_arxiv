    "mechanical switches have attracted the attention of the scientific community for a long time @xcite .",
    "one interesting aspect is the non - volatile nature of bits encoded into bistable mechanical systems .",
    "this condition could in principle avoid the typical heat production associated with losses due to electric currents .",
    "in fact , excess heat production during computation is one of the main limitations that standard cmos technology is presently facing in order to develop next generations of switches .",
    "present cmos switches are orders of magnitude far from the theoretical minimum heat required for computing .",
    "this fundamental bound , known as landauer limit@xcite , arises for any physical system encoding two logic states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath2 , when we intend to set the system into one given state , regardless of the knowledge of the initial state . according to the so - called landauer principle",
    ", such a reset operation must produce at least @xmath3 of heat ( with @xmath4 boltzmann constant)@xcite .",
    "however the landauer limit does not close the door to switch procedures that do not generate heat , once the initial state is known and a proper switch protocol is observed@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the encoding of a logical bit in a given configuration of a clamped - clamped single - layer graphene ribbon , as depicted in . to achieve two stable states ,",
    "a compression is applied by bringing closer the extremes of the ribbon in the @xmath5-direction that buckles the structure in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "this compression generates an energy barrier separating the two stable states corresponding to the upward and downward buckling . to identify which logic state the ribbon represents at time @xmath6",
    ", we monitor the coordinates of the central atom in the ribbon ( see zoomed image in ) .",
    "being @xmath7 the coordinates of the central atom , we indicate with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) the set of possible physical microstates with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "if the system is a micro state that belongs to @xmath9 ( @xmath8 ) we say that the ribbon encodes the logical state @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . starting from these considerations we present a _ reset protocol _ based on electrostatic forces acting on the graphene ribbon that approaches the landauer limit .",
    "the procedure is designed to reach the theoretical thermodynamic bound without altering the compression of the ribbon .",
    "we also discuss a similar _ switch protocol _ that realizes the switch process approaching @xmath12 .",
    "heat production during protocol execution is evaluated by using molecular dynamics simulations , performed with lammps@xcite . here",
    "we consider a simulated ribbon consisting in a @xmath13 suspended structure composed by 240 carbon atoms .",
    "carbon - carbon interactions are described through the rebo potential@xcite .",
    "the optimized lattice constant is @xmath14 which is in good agreement with both _",
    "ab initio _ calculations and experimental values@xcite .",
    "the obtained young modulus , @xmath15 , is also close to the expected value @xcite .",
    "all the simulations are performed at temperature @xmath16 .",
    "electrostatic forces are applied on the structure by a set of four electrodes , classified by labels _ u ( up ) _ , _ d ( down ) _ , _ l ( left ) _ and _ r ( right ) _ as shown in the top left side of . as the graphene ribbon is considered to be electrically connected to the ground , @xmath17 , the force produced by any of the electrodes is attractive if @xmath18 and zero otherwise . in the reference scheme ,",
    "( _ down _ ) electrodes generate positive ( negative ) forces along _ z _ direction .",
    "the total energy of the graphene ribbon under the action of electric external fields can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the momenta and positions of all carbon atoms respectively .",
    "@xmath22 is the total kinetic energy of the ribbon , @xmath23 the interatomic interaction energy and @xmath24 the total interaction energy between atoms and the external electric fields . in the case under consideration",
    "we have : @xmath25 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the number of atoms , @xmath27 is the clamp - clamp distance , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the heaviside function , and @xmath30 is the distance between the electrodes and the plane @xmath31 .",
    "parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are relative to the corresponding electrode and their values depend on the voltages applied according to the given protocol .    since the system is symmetric with respect to the @xmath36 plane , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 logic states have the same average potential energy .",
    "this implies that quasi - static transformations between two logic states are characterized by a zero change in the average total energy : @xmath37 , and consequently @xmath38 . in practice , transformations occurs in finite times , so @xmath39 may be nonzero .",
    "since we consider protocol duration much larger than the relaxation time of the system ( @xmath40 ) , we make the assumption that @xmath37 also in practice . under these conditions",
    "we can compute the generated heat as the average work performed on the system , via the stratonovich integral@xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denote averages over an ensemble of protocol realizations and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the starting and ending time of the protocol .",
    "in order to provide a visual description of the system dynamics , we focus our attention on the time evolution of the first two normal modes of the ribbon .",
    "being @xmath45 and @xmath46 the amplitudes of the first two flexural modes , we can write an effective potential energy of the ribbon @xmath47 in terms of these amplitudes ( ) . the local maximum in the potential landscape , @xmath48 , corresponds to a flat configuration of the ribbon .",

    "in particular we are interested in trajectories that go from one well to the other : they represent the physical realization of the switch between the two logic states .",
    "a trajectory that goes directly through the maximum at @xmath48 corresponds to a _ snapping _ of the ribbon . on the other hand trajectories that go around the maximum",
    "correspond to a dynamic that implies an intermediate _",
    "s_-shape ribbon configuration . as a matter of fact",
    ", snapping trajectories can be hardly associated with a thermodynamically reversible ( i.e. adiabatic ) transformation due to the difficulty to control the velocity of the switch dynamics . on the other hand , _",
    "s_-shape trajectories can be followed with an arbitrarily low velocity and thus result more promising for minimizing the heat production during the switch protocols . due to the presence of fluctuations the trajectories are random paths and",
    "are best monitored by computing the time evolution of the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in the following , we focus our attention on the reset operation . such an operation is generally performed to bring to a known logic state a bistable system that is in an unknown state .",
    "this implies that at the beginning the system has @xmath49 of probability of being both in @xmath9 and @xmath8 ; after the reset operation the system ends with @xmath50 of probability in @xmath8 ( or equivalently in @xmath9 ) . in our case ,",
