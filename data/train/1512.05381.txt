    "<S> to see why this is the case , it is more straightforward to consider the regime @xmath86 ( but @xmath87 ) , in which we can simply integrate out @xmath88 , yielding a mass for the internal gauge fields of the form @xmath89 and hence locking @xmath90 . for @xmath91 , the physics is similar ( see the supplementary materials ) . due to this locking , </S>",

    "<S> one should contrast the above possibility with the fate of the  un - gauged \" theory in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : qed3 ] ) , which has ( two copies ) @xmath73 and hence the critical state is fine tuned and is restricted to a single point . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gauge fluctuation ( of @xmath80 ) is necessary to open up a critical phase . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the previous dirac spin liquid in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , our theory has other interactions , for instance some term that explicitly breaks the @xmath95 symmetry . as a future direction </S>",
    "<S> , it would be very interesting to understand the infrared properties of such a field theory and contract it with the properties of the dirac qsl obtained from the parton constructions .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : final ] ) , we integrate out the compact @xmath1 gauge field @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the compactness of @xmath80 is actually important , as it might cause confinement by proliferating monopoles ( instantons ) in @xmath96 dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , note the monopoles and the anti - monopoles are indeed associated with the vortex rings @xcite , which are our dirac fermions @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> these fields being gapless generate long range interactions between monopoles and anti - monopoles , binding them to form magnetic dipoles and thus suppressing the confinement caused by the compactness of @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to know the relation between the physical operators ( e.g. spin ) and fermionic field . </S>",
    "<S> such relation can be obtained using a coupled wire approach , which however is very technical and beyond the scope of present work . but based on symmetry , we can fix the form of this relation as @xmath98 , and the scalar chirality is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are some number .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion and outlook _ </S>",
    "<S>  we investigate the nature of the kagome spin liquid ( ksl ) realized in the easy - axis xxz spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnets using a lattice gauge description consisting of @xmath1 gauge field coupled to dynamic bosonic spinons . starting with an effective field theory for the deconfined critical point between a superfluid and a @xmath1 spt phase ( with spontaneous trs breaking ) , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ksl can be obtained by promoting a global @xmath1 symmetry of the bosons to a local gauge structure . in our approach </S>",
    "<S> the gauge fluctuation converts the fine - tuned deconfined critical point into an extended critical phase . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> the ksl is obtained by  gauging \" the deconfined critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this is a concrete implementation of the perceived deep connections among spts , associated critical points , and qsls , through the concept of gauging global symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare our theory with the @xmath1 dirac spin liquid ( dsl ) from parton constructions @xcite . due to the inherent importance of the gauge fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> our approach is beyond parton based mean - field construction of qsls . </S>",
    "<S> however , presently , it is unclear whether our qsl phase is different from the previous dsl or not . </S>",
    "<S> one way to understand the issue is to compare the quantum numbers of the low energy excitations in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> even if they are the same phase , our work still advances the understanding on this celebrated problem by providing a complimentary insight to the problem and more importantly explaining the natural proximity of the csl phase in this class of models . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to ask whether the speculated vortex duality for dirac fermions @xcite could apply for our kagome spin liquid theory . </S>",
    "<S> such possible duality can be understood as the self - dual of the ( ungauged ) deconfined critical point , which might further serve as an interesting probe for our theory both numerically and experimentally .    </S>",
