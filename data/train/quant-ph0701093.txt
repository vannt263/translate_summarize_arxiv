    "entanglement  @xcite , as an essential feature of quantum mechanics , helps us to distinguish the classical and quantum nature of matter world .",
    "it has become a key ingredient in quantum information processing , such as quantum computing , quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography  @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "generally a realistic system is surrounded by an environment .",
    "thus the effects of the quantum decoherence such as quantum dephasing on quantum entanglement should be considered for quantum opene systems .",
    "it is reasonable that when we study quantum effects induced by entanglement , the two - particle system should hold phase relations between the components of the entangled states .",
    "thus perceivably , due to the interactions with environment , we can expect that the dephasing of two - particle system can demonstrate some exotic properties .",
    "recently , yu and eberly  @xcite showed that two entangled qubits became completely disentangled in a finite time under the influence of pure vacuum noise .",
    "surprisingly , they found that the behaviors of local decoherence is different from the spontaneous disentanglement .",
    "the decoherence effects take an infinite time evolution under the influence of vacuum noise while the entanglement displays a  sudden death \" in a finite time . in their investigations and other studies on disentanglement in open quantum systems",
    "@xcite  @xcite , only qubit systems are considered . here",
    ", the disentanglement process is characterized by time evolution of the concurrence  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the concurrence is not available in the higher - dimensional systems .    for the systems with spins larger than @xmath0",
    ", one can use the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) method  @xcite to study disentanglement . for the mixed states of two spin halves and ( 1/2 , 1 ) mixed spins",
    ", the ppt method can fully characterize entanglement .",
    "however , in the case of two qutrits and even larger spins , one only know that if a state does not have ppt , the state must be entangled . in other words , one may use the method to witness entanglement . actually ,",
    "in the case of higher dimension , there are two qualitatively different types of entanglement  @xcite , free entanglement ( fe ) which corresponds to the states without a ppt , and bound entanglement ( be ) corresponding to the entangled states , however , with a ppt .",
    "the be is an intrinsic property and can not be distilled to a singlet form , thus it can not be used alone for quantum communication .",
    "nevertheless , the be can be activated and then contribute to quantum communication  horodecki3 .",
    "a formal entanglement - energy analogy  @xcite implies that the bound entanglement is like the energy of a system confined in a shallow potential well . if we add a small amount of extra energy , behaving as a perturbation , to the system , its energy can be deliberated .",
    "the existence of bound entangled states reveals a transparent form of irreversibility in entanglement processing  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an open composite system , a two - qutrit system commonly coupled to an environment , and study a type of dynamical process of disentanglement , where the two qutrits are initially prepared in a bound entangled state .",
    "we would like to reveal that different environment gives different dynamics of entanglement .",
    "firstly , a bosonic heat bath is considered .",
    "we remark that this modeling of environment is universal  leggett , sun in the sense that any environment weakly coupled to a system can be approximated by a collection of harmonic oscillators .",
    "secondly , we consider a spin environment consisting of spin halves which can be considered as a fermionic environment .",
    "we let two types of bound entangled states being initial state of the two qutrits in order to find the different properties of bound entangled state during the quantum dephasing . and initially the environments are assumed to be at thermal equilibrium states , which helps us to find effects of the thermal fluctuation on dynamics of quantum entanglement .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the bosonic environment and give the analytical results of fe and be .",
    "we numerically study the be to illustrate the details of the dynamics of entanglement . in sec .",
    "iii , the two qutrits are coupled to a spin environment .",
    "also the analytical and numerical results are given to show the effects of coupling strength , temperature and energy spectrum structure on the dynamical behaviors of entanglement .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we start with a well known model of the pure dephasing  @xcite , where two qutrits interact with the environment , which is modelled as a heat bath with many harmonic oscillators of frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads @xmath2 ,   \\label{1}\\]]where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are @xmath7 components of two spin-1 operators , and @xmath8 denotes the coupling strength between the spins and the heat bath .    in order to study the dynamical process of entanglement in our system , it is convenient for us to study the time evolution in the interaction picture .",
    "here , @xmath9is the free hamiltonian , and the interaction hamiltonian @xmath10then , through the wei - norman method  @xcite , the time evolution operator in the interaction picture is factorized as , @xmath11 ,   \\label{u}\\]]where @xmath12 @xmath13and @xmath14 $ ] is the displacement operator .    before discussing the dynamical process of entanglement",
    ", we introduce two quantities to quantitatively study entanglement .",
    "one is the negativity  vidal , which can be used to study fe . for a state @xmath15",
    ", negativity is defined in terms of the trace norm of the partial transposed matrix @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the partial transpose with respect to the first subsystem .",
    "if @xmath18 , then the two - spin state is free entangled . as an entanglement measure ,",
    "the negativity is operational and easy to compute , and it has been used to characterize entanglement in large spin system very well  @xcite-  @xcite .    in order to characterize",
    "be , one can use the so - called realignment criterion ( cross - norm criterion ) which proved to be very efficient  @xcite .",
    "the operation of realignment on the density matrix is just as @xmath19 .",
    "a separate state @xmath20 always satisfies @xmath21 we call this the witness quantity . only when @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the state is bound entangled .      in the following discussions , we consider the dynamical evolution process of the two - spin 1 system , deriven by the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) with the initial state being in the horodecki s bound entangled state  @xcite .      the bound entangled",

    "6 , namely , at low temperature be only oscillates around the initial value of the be . at higher temperature be decays sharply with time , and revivals are also observed with revival amplitudes decreasing with time .",
    "we also study negativity , however , it always keeps zero which means there does not exist fe all the time .",
    "in summary , we have studied the decoherence phenomena of two - qutrit system couple to an enviroment when this open systems are initially prepared in a bound entangled state .",
    "the so - called `` sudden death '' phenomenon  @xcite of entanglement can be found in our studies as a common feature of be evolution .",
    "two typical pure dephasing systems , the bosonic and the spin systems are considered in order to show this kind of universality of decoherence process with be . here",
    ", we used the realignment criterion to characterize be , and the ppt criterion to study fe . beyond the negativity ,",
    "we have introduced a novel witness quantity @xmath41 to study be .",
    "those two approaches are operational and convenient to use .",
    "two kinds of be in initial state of the open system are considered , one is given by horodecki et al , and another is constructed from the unextendible product basis .",
    "one of our central result is to express the quantity @xmath41 and negativity @xmath47 in terms of three decoherence factors , and these factors are analytically obtained . in the case of bosonic environments , the gaussian decay and the exponential decay of",
    "the be was found , and in the case of spin environment , we find that be can display a gaussian decay . in both environments , the collapse and revivals of the be are observed for system frequency distribution being in a higher region with an appropriate width .",
    "larger coupling strength @xmath8 , larger environment size @xmath102 and higher temperature will enhance the disentanglement process .",
    "for the horocecki s be in the spin environment , we find that the be can be stable against low temperature increase",
    ".    finally we have to point out that since we are lack of entanglement measure for two qutrits , the study of decoherence of entanglement here is incomplete",
    ". nevertheless , the realignment criterion and the ppt criterion are very efficient to characterize be",
    ". it will be interesting to consider decoherence of be under other decoherence processes such as dissipation , and investigate the robustness of the be .",
