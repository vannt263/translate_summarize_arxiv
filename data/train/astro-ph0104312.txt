    "magnetic fields trace the flows of relativistic plasma ejected from the cores of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the form of powerful jets .",
    "ordering of the jet magnetic fields by shocks ( e.g.  hughes , aller , & aller 1985 , marscher & gear 1985 ) or shear @xcite occurs within a fraction of a parsec ( pc ) from the jets points of origin .",
    "though synchrotron theory predicts sources may exhibit up to 75% fractional linear polarization ( @xmath3 ) in the optically thin regime , this level of polarization has never been observed in agn cores .",
    "it is likely that the modest @xmath3 observed in agn cores at centimeter wavelengths results from disordered magnetic fields , depolarization , and high optical depths .",
    "86  ghz ( @xmath4 mm ) very long baseline polarimetry ( vlbp ) should be sensitive to intrinsic field order and may reveal the first instances of magnetic field ordering mechanisms , for the effects of faraday rotation ( @xmath5 ) and depolarization are reduced at high frequencies .",
    "images of 3c273 and 3c279 were produced from data taken with four antennas ( fort davis , los alamos , pie town , kitt peak 12-m ) during the coordinated millimeter vlbi array ( cmva ) program ca01 over @xmath67  hours on 2000 april 17 ( epoch 2000.30 ) .",
    "the data were recorded at 86  ghz with a total bandwidth of 64  mhz .",
    "this four station subset of the complete cmva run was correlated on the nrao correlator as a certification test of the haystack mark iv correlator system .",
    "approximately @xmath7 total integration were devoted to each source leading to a theoretical rms noise of @xmath8  mjy beam@xmath9 .",
    "the complete , eight station , @xmath624 hour cmva run , providing full tracks on both 3c273 and 3c279 with a global array of mixed single- and dual - polarization antennas , will be correlated at haystack later in 2001 .",
    "calibration and hybrid imaging were done using the nrao aips and caltech difmap packages .",
    "total intensity is notated as @xmath0 , and linear polarization is represented by the complex quantity @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the polarized intensity , and @xmath12 is the electric vector position angle ( evpa ) .",
    "explanations of vlbp calibration and imaging may be found in @xcite , roberts , wardle , & brown ( 1994 ) , and @xcite .    the calibration process for 86  ghz vlbi data must account for complexities not present in lower frequency data @xcite .",
    "for example , coherence times at 86  ghz are typically only @xmath13  seconds , severely limiting choice of solution interval in many aips tasks .",
    "many antennas succumb to pointing problems at 86  ghz , primarily due to wind - loading .",
    "the impact of these problems escalates when considering that 86  ghz data is lower ( by a factor of @xmath14 ) in snr than 43  ghz data .    of primary concern was calibration of the instrumental polarization ( d - terms ) .",
    "careful tests were performed to determine the veracity of the results .",
    "first , the sources were imaged with no d - term solution applied .",
    "resulting images have scattered polarization throughout the fields of both 3c273 and 3c279 .",
    "next , the d - terms were calculated individually for each source using the aips task lpcal , applied to the data , and then the data were imaged .",
    "the maps presented in this paper are derived from these individual applications of lpcal . as a test of the lpcal results , the d - terms for 3c273",
    "were then applied to 3c279 and vice versa with no apparent change in the maps .",
    "the task pcal was run on 3c279 and the resulting d - terms were applied to both sources , again with no change in the maps .    for 3c273 ,",
    "the d - terms range from @xmath15 , and for 3c279 , from @xmath16 , resulting in a typical value of @xmath17 .",
    "these ranges represent the same set of d - terms offset by a vector constant , arising from the special case of the four antennas having effectively the same parallactic angle coverage @xcite .",
    "naturally weighted images in @xmath0 and @xmath18 are presented in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "these images are the first 86  ghz vlbi stokes @xmath0 and @xmath18 images presented for any source .",
    "currently , there is no known calibrator by which to register absolute evpas at 86  ghz ; therefore sticks in the @xmath18 images represent the orientation of the electric field vectors assigned an arbitrary instrumental position angle , rotated through an adopted 90@xmath19 evpa calibration constant as explained in  4.2 .",
    "note that the evpas of the two sources _ relative to each other _ are correctly registered .",
    "the @xmath0 images presented in figures 1@xmath20 and 2@xmath20 have dynamic ranges of @xmath6100:1 , and the fourier transforms of the clean components represented by the images result in the best matches to the @xmath21 data among many trials of hybrid mapping and self - calibration , down to time scales of thirty seconds in phase , and two minutes in amplitude .",
    "difmap s `` modelfit '' routine was used to fit individual components in @xmath0 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . because @xmath22 and @xmath23 positions were restricted to the locations of the @xmath0 peaks , resultant values of @xmath24",
    "do not necessarily represent the true maximum @xmath24 of a component .",
    "model fits for both 3c273 and 3c279 are presented in table 1 .",
    "3c273 ( j1229 + 0203 ) is a low optical polarization quasar ( lpq ) with @xmath25 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath26  pc / mas .",
    "km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 and @xmath27 are assumed in all calculations . ] a typical core - jet source , 3c273 contains a bright component to the east which is resolved in the north - south direction , and a jet extending to the west - southwest .",
    "the @xmath18 image shown in figure  1@xmath28 displays linear polarization only in the jet component ( c2 ) adjacent to the core ( d ) ; the core itself is unpolarized to a limit of @xmath29 .",
    "model fits to the data ( table  1 ) show that c2 has @xmath30 .",
    "historically , at frequencies lower than 86  ghz 3c273 displays very low levels of fractional core polarization with increasing levels further down the jet .",
    "3c273 s variable nature and the differing resolutions provided by images at other frequencies , make temporal and spatial comparisons of all but the core quite difficult .",
    "the most recent , published vlbi values of @xmath3 for 3c273 are presented by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter l&s ) . at 15  ghz ( epoch 1997.07 ) , 3c273 displayed @xmath31 in the core @xcite . at 22  ghz ( epoch 1999.03 ) , l&s found a maximum core polarization of @xmath32 ; 43  ghz results , also at epoch 1999.03 , reveal a maximum core polarization of @xmath33 .",
    "3c279 ( j1256 - 0547 ) is a compact source with a jet extending to the west - southwest .",
    "it is a high optical polarization quasar ( hpq ) with @xmath34 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath35  pc / mas . in the @xmath18 image of figure  2@xmath28 , both",
    "the core ( d ) and the jet component ( c1 ) are linearly polarized .",
    "in fact , c1 is highly polarized , displaying @xmath36 , while the core displays @xmath37 ( table  1 ) .    the 3c279 results presented here are consistent with past high frequency vlbi observations of the source .",
    "taylor ( 1998 , 2000 ) found 15  ghz fractional polarization of @xmath38 in the core of 3c279 at epoch 1997.07 , and @xmath39 at epoch 1998.59 - an increase of 90% .",
    "l&s found upper limits on the core polarizations to be 3.9% at 22  ghz , and 6.6% at 43  ghz ; both at epoch 1999.03 .",
    "epoch 1997.58 vlba observations at 43  ghz show @xmath40 in the core of 3c279 ( a.  p. marscher et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "using an average proper motion of 1  mas / yr for 3c273 as derived from six epochs of dual - frequency data by @xcite , extrapolation of jet components from epoch 1999.03 ( l&s ) to the 86  ghz epoch of 2000.30 was performed .",
    "l&s s component h evolves to a distance of 2.1  mas from the core , coincident with 86  ghz component c1 .",
    "two intermediate components from l&s , i and j , are located at 1.4 and 1.6  mas , respectively , from the core .",
    "these two components lie between components c1 and c2 of the 86  ghz data .",
    "similarly , a proper motion of 0.2  mas / yr , also from @xcite , was used to extrapolate l&s s epoch 1999.03 3c279 jet components to epoch 2000.30 .",
    "after extrapolation , l&s s component f falls at a distance of 0.9  mas from the core , consistent with 86  ghz component c1 .",
    "component f / c1 reveals high levels of polarization at 22  ghz ( @xmath41 ) , 43  ghz ( @xmath42 ) and 86  ghz ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "high levels of fractional polarization ( @xmath44 ) are not unique , and have been seen in a number of sources ; e.g.  32% in oj287 @xcite , 20% in bl  lacertae @xcite , and 29% in 3c454.3 @xcite .",
    "note that the peak @xmath45 in 3c279 is located 0.85  mas from the core ; between the core and c1 .",
    "as previously stated , no absolute evpa ( @xmath12 ) calibration can yet be performed on the 86  ghz data .",
    "nonetheless , the evpas of the two sources may be compared to each other , and to values measured at other frequencies .    if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 is the difference between the evpas of 3c273 and 3c279 at 86  ghz .",
    "similarly , single dish data from the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) results in @xmath48 at 270  ghz , epoch 1995.98 @xcite , and @xmath49 at 350  ghz , epoch 2000.26 ( j.  a. stevens 2001 , private communication ) .",
    "epoch 1999.03 vlbi observations at 43  ghz show @xmath50 ( l&s ) .",
    "the 86  ghz results are thus consistent with @xmath51 values at adjacent frequencies . comparing the @xmath12 values of 3c273 and 3c279 at 86  ghz with those at 43",
    "ghz suggests an offset between the two frequencies of @xmath52 .",
    "this comparison is reasonable , as l&s s 43  ghz data is closest in resolution to and is only one spectral octave off from the 86  ghz data",
    ". it would therefore be reasonable to assume that the proper evpa calibration constant at 86  ghz is @xmath52 .",
    "this estimated 90@xmath19 calibration constant has been applied to the @xmath18 images shown in figures 1@xmath28 and 2@xmath28 .",
    "it is well known that the evpas of agn jets are closely related to their jet position angles , @xmath53 ( e.g.  cawthorne et al . 1993 ) .",
    "vlbi observations at many frequencies generally show the evpa of 3c273 to be transverse ( @xmath54 ) to the vlbi jet axis , and the evpa of 3c279 to be longitudinal ( @xmath55 ) to the vlbi jet axis ( e.g.  15  ghz : homan & wardle 1999 ; 22 and 43  ghz : l&s ; 43  ghz : a.  p. marscher et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) . aligning",
    "the evpas measured in single dish measurements at 270  ghz @xcite and 350  ghz ( j.  a. stevens 2001 , private communication ) with the vlbi jet position angle of a lower frequency produces the same results : 3c273 displays @xmath54 and 3c279 displays @xmath55 .",
    "the 86  ghz @xmath18 images presented in figures 1@xmath28 and 2@xmath28 reveal 3c273 s evpa to be transverse to the jet direction , and 3c273 s to be longitudinal to the jet direction , consistent with results at adjacent frequencies .",
    "this suggests that application of the estimated 90@xmath19 evpa calibration constant suggested above is appropriate .",
    "taylor ( 1998 , 2000 ) and l&s derive absolute faraday rotation measures ( rms ) in excess of 1000  rad  m@xmath2 in the cores of many quasars , including 3c273 and 3c279 . beyond projected distances of @xmath56 parsecs from the core ,",
    "rms in the jets of quasars drop to @xmath57  rad m@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the presence of large rms suggests that parsec - sized faraday screens with organized magnetic fields will be found near the cores of quasars ( l&s ) .",
    "as faraday rotation is @xmath58 , rms are expected to diminish at high frequencies .",
    "the observations presented here challenge this expectation by showing the cores of 3c273 and 3c279 to have low levels of polarization even at 86  ghz .",
    "the core of 3c273 is unpolarized in vlbp observations up through 43  ghz , and the addition of the 86  ghz results ( @xmath59 ) show that this trend continues at higher frequencies .",
    "it is interesting to explore the case where depolarization of 3c273 s core is attributed to faraday depolarization alone .",
    "assuming that @xmath60 is the standard deviation of a gaussian distribution of many rms over a finely spaced grid @xcite , and that @xmath30 of the jet represents a purely undepolarized state , @xmath60 must be @xmath190000  rad m@xmath2 for the core of 3c273 .    alternatively , the magnetic field in the core of 3c273 may be initially tangled , becoming ordered somewhere between the core ( d ) and the adjacent polarized jet component ( c2 ) .",
    "the degree of order of the magnetic field may be calculated assuming the magnetic field in the unshocked jet fluid contains a small - scale tangled component plus a uniform component aligned perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the resulting fraction of magnetic energy in the tangled component in 3c273 is then @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the cmva results presented here validate 86  ghz vlbp as a practical and potent new tool to probe magnetic field properties of agn cores . with only 86  ghz observations ,",
    "it is impossible to distinguish between the depolarizing effects of a faraday screen , and a tangled magnetic field .",
    "future simultaneous , multi - frequency vlbp observations , including ones at 86  ghz , are crucial in testing various depolarization mechanisms in the cores of 3c273 and 3c279 . with the addition of new 86  ghz antennas , particularly those that provide long baselines , resolutions much higher than those currently attainable at 43  ghz should be achieved .",
    "high resolution observations should set limits on the sizes of faraday screens in both 3c273 and 3c279 by resolving the cores of these objects into smaller components , thereby testing the discussion of  4.3 .",
