    "introduced fifteen years ago , the method of qcd sum rules @xcite has become one of the most useful and reliable calculational schemes to derive hadronic properties from first principles with a minimal number of additional phenomenological assumptions .",
    "originally , focusing on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of two - point correlation functions one aimed at the determination of masses and coupling constants of ground states .",
    "the framework has then been extended and also applied to other dynamical characteristics of hadrons such as form factors and decay amplitudes .",
    "these extensions are based on ope of three- and four - point correlation functions .",
    "nevertheless , no new input parameters appear which is one of the most attractive features of this approach .",
    "all essential parameters such as vacuum condensates , coupling constants and thresholds of higher states are fixed by corresponding two - point sum rules .    on the other hand ,",
    "straightforward application of qcd sum rules in their original version to many - point correlation functions runs into a number of technical problems .",
    "first of all , the correlation functions are to be calculated in the deep euclidean region .",
    "the result is then continued to physical momenta with the help of dispersion relations . in the presence of many channels ,",
    "this continuation is not at all trivial . in some cases like for on mass - shell hadronic vertices and amplitudes",
    "one must rely on extrapolations which are plausible but not rigorous .",
    "furthermore , the ope for n - point correlation functions is usually represented by feynman - type diagrams which are used to calculate the wilson coefficients in perturbation theory .",
    "these diagrams grow rapidly in number with n and become rather complicated .",
    "finally , in order to include higher resonances and continua of states into the sum rules , one often has to resort to models based on the concept of quark - hadron duality .",
    "these models usually work well for two - point correlation functions , but may be too crude already in the case of double dispersion integrals .    for these and other reasons , it is very important to develop alternative , more economical methods which avoid these problems .",
    "clearly , starting from vacuum correlation functions , applying ope and deriving sum rules in terms of local vacuum condensates is only one way to account for nonperturbative quark - gluon dynamics .",
    "other approaches leading to different versions of qcd sum rules include the external field method @xcite-@xcite and induced vacuum condensates , the concept of nonlocal condensates @xcite , and the combination with light - cone wave functions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "each of these versions has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the comparison of the results may shed some light on the accuracy and reliability of the different approaches .    in this report",
    "we want to illustrate some of the current trends in the development of the qcd sum rule method by presenting two recent calculations relevant for b - physics . in section 2",
    "we discuss the calculation of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 form factors using an expansion in terms of pion and kaon wave functions on the light - cone with increasing twist , and compare the results with the predictions of conventional qcd sum rules .",
    "then , in section 3 , we study the problem how to calculate the amplitude of the prominent weak decay @xmath12 beyond the usual factorization approximation . in other words ,",
    "we undertake the difficult task to estimate the nonfactorizable contributions to the decay amplitude originating from quark - gluon interactions at scales between the heavy b - quark mass and the hadronization scale .",
    "following an idea suggested in ref . [ 11 ] for @xmath13 meson nonleptonic decays , we try to extract this amplitude from a suitable four - point correlation function treated within the framework of conventional qcd sum rules .",
    "the standard way to derive qcd sum rules for the transition amplitude @xmath15 between given ground state hadrons @xmath16 and @xmath2 starts from the vacuum correlation function of three currents , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is chosen such as to create the hadron @xmath16 ( @xmath2 ) from the vacuum and @xmath20 denotes the time - ordered product .",
    "a double dispersion relation in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) being the four - momentum in the @xmath16 ( @xmath2)-channel , is then used to relate this correlation function calculated in the euclidean region with its imaginary part containing the desired transition amplitude .",
    "the remainder of the calculation is essentially the same as in the case of two - point qcd sum rules : derivation of ope in terms of local quark - gluon condensates , subtraction of excited state and continuum contributions and borel transformation .",
    "since the quark - gluon condensates are universal , they can be taken from any qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "furthermore , the coupling constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as the thresholds of higher states in the @xmath16 and @xmath2 channels are fixed by the two - point sum rules for the correlation functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . hence , as already pointed out , one has essentially no new parameters .",
    "this procedure has been applied to a variety of problems such as the pion form factor @xcite , radiative charmonium transition rates @xcite-@xcite , and semileptonic form factors of heavy mesons @xcite-@xcite .    here",
    "we demonstrate an alternative method which may be used in cases where one of the hadrons , @xmath16 or @xmath2 , is a light meson .",
    "an important example is provided by the @xmath10 form factors @xmath29 which determine the matrix element = 2f_^+(p^2)q_+ [ f_^+(p^2)+f_^-(p^2)]p_[form ] with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the @xmath2 and @xmath33 momenta and the momentum transfer , respectively . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on the phenomenologically more interesting form factor @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath35 form factor @xmath36 can be treated in parallel by obvious formal replacements .",
    "numerical results will be shown for both @xmath34 and @xmath36 .    instead of investigating the vacuum averaged correlation of the @xmath37 transition current with two other currents carrying the @xmath2 and @xmath33 quantum numbers , we consider the matrix element f_(p , q)= i d^4xe^ipx<(q)t\\{|u(x)_b(x ) ,    @xmath38 between the vacuum and an on - shell pion state .",
    "this object is represented diagrammatically in fig .",
    "1 . the pion momentum squared , @xmath39 , vanishes in the chiral limit adopted throughout this discussion .",
    "moreover , the light @xmath40 and @xmath41 quarks forming the pion eventually propagate to large distances .",
    "in contrast , the b - quark still propagates far off - shell provided that @xmath42 is taken sufficiently large and negative , and the time - like momentum transfer squared @xmath43 is far from the kinematical limit , @xmath44 .    formally , contracting the @xmath45-quark fields in ( [ 1a ] ) and keeping only the lowest order term , i.e. the free @xmath45-quark propagator , yields f ( ( p+q)^2,p^2)= i d^4x e^i(p - p)x _ a  , [ f ] where _",
    "a(x^2 , qx ) = < ( q)|u(x)_a d(0)0 >  , [ phi ] @xmath46 denoting certain combinations of dirac matrices .",
    "this approximation corresponds to fig .",
    "the high virtuality of the @xmath45-quark propagating between the points @xmath47 and @xmath48 guarantees that the @xmath40 and @xmath41 quarks are emitted at almost light - like distances . in that case",
    ", it is justified to keep only the first few terms in the expansion of the matrix elements ( [ phi ] ) around @xmath49 , that is near the light - cone : _",
    "a(x^2 , q x ) = _ n _ a^n(q x ) ( x^2)^n [ phi1 ]  .",
    "logarithms in @xmath50 which may also appear in ( [ phi1 ] ) are disregarded for simplicity .",
    "these terms can be consistently treated by means of qcd perturbation theory .",
    "they give rise to normalization scale dependence . because of translation invariance , the coefficients @xmath51 must have the form _ a^n ( qx ) ~_0 ^ 1 du_a^n(u)exp(iuqx )  .",
    "[ varphi ] inserting ( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ varphi ] ) into ( [ f ] ) and integrating over @xmath47 and @xmath52 , one obtains , schematically , f((p+q)^2 , p^2 ) ~_a _ n ^1_0 du  . [ f1 ] it is thus possible to calculate the invariant function @xmath53 with reasonable accuracy in the kinematical region of highly virtual b - quarks provided one knows the distribution functions @xmath54 at least for low values of @xmath55 .",
    "these distributions contain essential information about the dynamics at large distances and play a similar role as the vacuum condensates in the conventional ope of vacuum correlation functions .",
    "as it turns out , the distributions @xmath54 are nothing but light - cone wave functions of the pion the twist of which is growing with @xmath55 .",
    "these wave functions were introduced long ago in the context of hard exclusive processes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the leading twist 2 wave function is defined by = -if_q_^1_0 du e^iuq x _ ( u )  , [ tw2 ] where the exponential factor involving the gluon field is necessary for gauge invariance . the asymptotic form of @xmath56 can be obtained from perturbative considerations and is well known : _ ( u)=6u(1-u ) . [ as ] over the years a great deal has been learned about these wave functions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "all important twist two , three and four wave functions have been identified and their asymptotic form has been determined . besides two - particle wave functions reflecting the quark - antiquark structure of mesons , also three - particle wave functions associated with the quark - antiquark - gluon component have been studied . very important for practical applications , nonasymptotic corrections have been estimated considering expansions in orthogonal polynomials and renormalizing the coefficients of this expansions in qcd perturbation theory . furthermore , conventional two - point qcd sum rules have been used @xcite to fix the first few moments of the low twist wave functions . based on these estimates and improvements , various models for the nonasymptotic form of these functions have been suggested ( see , for example , refs . [ 10,28,32 ] ) .",
    "the approach outlined above together with the accumulated knowledge of pion and kaon wave functions has been employed in ref . [ 6 ] to calculate the @xmath57 form factor at zero momentum transfer , in ref .",
    "[ 7 ] to get the @xmath58 form factor , and in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] to derive the @xmath59 and @xmath35 form factors including the momentum dependence .",
    "in our calculation of @xmath34 and @xmath60 we have included quark - antiquark wave functions up to twist four .",
    "in addition , we have also estimated the first - order correction to the free @xmath45-quark propagation shown in fig .",
    "1b which involves quark - antiquark - gluon wave functions . on the other hand , the perturbative @xmath61 corrections indicated in figs .",
    "1c and 1d have not been evaluated directly , but have been taken into account indirectly as explained below .",
    "the direct calculation of these corrections is on its way .    in order to extract the desired form factor from the resulting invariant function",
    "@xmath62 sketched in ( [ f1 ] ) we employ a qcd sum rule with respect to the @xmath2-meson channel . writing a dispersion relation in @xmath42 , we approximate the hadronic spectral function in the @xmath2-channel by the pole contribution of the @xmath2 meson and a continuum contribution . in accordance with quark - hadron duality ,",
    "the latter is identified with the spectral function derived from the qcd representation ( [ f1 ] ) above the threshold @xmath63 .",
    "formally , subtraction of the continuum then amounts to simply changing the lower integration boundary in ( 7 ) from 0 to @xmath64 .",
    "after borel transformation one arrives at a sum rule for the product @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath2 meson decay constant .",
    "it is important to note that the numerical values to be substituted for @xmath67 , @xmath66 and the threshold @xmath68 are interrelated by the qcd sum rule for the correlation function @xmath69 .",
    "we stress that the latter sum rule should be used without @xmath61 corrections in order to be consistent with the neglect of these corrections in the sum rule for @xmath65 ( see also ref .",

    "[ 8 ] the twist 2 wave function @xmath74 is corrected for nonasymptotic effects @xcite,@xcite , the twist 3 wave functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 are taken in their asymptotic form .",
    "numerically , the higher twist contributions turn out to be more important than the nonasymptotic corrections to the leading twist wave function . for brevity , in ( [ 20a ] )",
    "we have omitted the contributions from the twist four quark - antiquark wave functions and the term involving the twist three quark - antiquark - gluon wave function .",
    "these contributions are quantitatively negligible .",
    "further details can be found in ref . [",
    "numerical results for @xmath77 are plotted in fig .",
    "2a for two values of the borel parameter @xmath78 characterizing the fiducial range of the method .",
    "as can be seen , the predictions are quite stable under variation of @xmath78 as long as @xmath43 is not getting too close to @xmath79 . for comparison , we also show results obtained by other methods .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that @xmath77 is not very sensitive to the precise shape of the leading twist wave function @xmath80 at least at @xmath81 .",
    "we have checked this by replacing the nonasymptotic two - humped wave function @xcite used for fig .",
    "2a by the simple asymptotic wave function given in ( [ as ] ) .",
    "the @xmath11 form factor @xmath60 was calculated analogous to @xmath34 using the leading twist wave function @xmath82 from ref . [",
    "the higher twist wave functions are left unchanged .",
    "the numerical result is presented in fig . 2b .",
    "although @xmath60 is not accessible directly in semileptonic @xmath2 decays , it determines the factorizable part of the nonleptonic decay amplitude for @xmath83 and is therefore phenomenologically very important .",
    "later , in section 3 we shall make use of the value f^+_k ( m_^2)= 0.55 0.05  .",
    "[ fpsi ]    in conclusion , we emphasize that light - cone sum rules such as the ones exemplified in this section represent a well defined alternative to the conventional qcd sum rule method . in this variant , the nonperturbative aspects are described by a set of wave functions on the light - cone with varying twist and quark - gluon multiplicity .",
    "these universal functions can be studied in a variety of processes involving the @xmath33 and @xmath84 meson , or other light mesons .",
    "the most important advantage of the light - cone sum rules is the possibility to take hadrons on mass - shell from the very beginning .",
    "one can thus avoid the notorious model - dependence of extrapolations from euclidean to physical momenta in light channels .",
    "furthermore , in many cases the light - cone approach is technically much easier than the conventional qcd sum rule technique .",
    "finally , the light - cone method is rather versatile .",
    "it can also profitably be employed to calculate heavy - to - light form factors such as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , amplitudes of rare decays such as @xmath87 @xcite , and hadronic couplings such as @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "just in passing we mention that the @xmath88 coupling can be extracted from the correlation function ( 2 ) by performing a second borel transformation in @xmath43 .",
    "needless to say , light - cone sum rule are equally useful in calculating properties of @xmath13 mesons and also of light hadrons @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the main problem to be solved if one wants to fully exploit the light - cone approach is a reliable determination of the nonasymptotic effects in the wave functions . in this respect ,",
    "measurements of hadronic form factors , couplings etc . can provide important information .",
    "a second , mainly technical problem , concerns higher order perturbative corrections , such as those shown in figs .",
    "1c and 1d , and the possible occurrence of large logarithms .",
    "since the earliest estimates @xcite@xmath89@xcite , nonleptonic two - body decays of heavy mesons are usually calculated by splitting the appropriate matrix element of the weak hamiltonian into a product of a semileptonic transition form factor and a decay constant of one of the final mesons . on the theoretical side , one still lacks a strict proof of this recipe .",
    "empirically , with the accumulating data on @xmath13 decays , it soon became clear that naive factorization fails @xcite . in order to achieve agreement with experiment",
    "it is necessary to let the coefficients of the ope of the weak hamiltonian deviate from their values predicted in short - distance qcd .",
    "phenomenologically @xcite , the coefficients are reinterpreted and treated as free parameters to be determined from experiment . for @xmath13 decays , it has been shown @xcite that the fitted values can be reconciled with the short - distance expectations if the matrix elements of the local operators appearing in the ope are expanded in @xmath90 and if only the leading terms are kept .",
    "this observation gave rise to the rule of discarding nonleading in @xmath90 terms .",
    "factorization combined with this rule leads to a satisfactory description of the majority of two - body @xmath13-decays .",
    "for @xmath2 decays , an instructive example is provided by the illustrious decay mode @xmath1 .",
    "the effective weak hamiltonian responsible for this decay is given by h_w= v_cbv^*_cs\\{c_1o_1+c_2o_2 }  , [ h ] o_1=(|s^c)(|c_b),o_2=(|c^c)(|s_b ) [ o ] where @xmath91 is the fermi constant , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the relevant ckm matrix elements and @xmath94 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 incorporate the short - distance effects arising from the renormalization of @xmath97 from @xmath98 to @xmath99 .",
    "these coefficients are known to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite,@xcite . while @xmath100 already possesses the appropriate flavour structure , this is the case for @xmath101 only after fierz transformation : o_1=",

    "note that in this approximation = < j/^2 c0 > < k_2 b b>=0 [ nf ] because of color conservation . moreover , using a parametrization of @xmath103 analogous to ( [ form ] ) and @xmath104 one readily obtains the following expression for the decay amplitude : a ( b j / k ) = gv_cbv^*_cs(c_2 + 3)f _ f^+_k(p^2=m_^2)m _ ( q )  .",
    "[ decay ] the corresponding branching ratio is given by @xmath105 m_b^3(1-)^3_b [ br ] where @xmath106 is the @xmath2 meson lifetime .",

    "[ c12 ] as a matter of fact , the combination @xmath114 turns out to be particularly sensitive to the precise values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 , as pointed out in ref . [ 43 ] . despite of this uncertainty , the branching ratio expected from naive factorization",
    "is undoubtedly much lower than the recent experimental results @xcite : @xmath115 br ( b^0 j / k^0 ) = ( 0.075 0.024 0.008 ) %  .",
    "[ cleo ] on the other hand , applying the rule of discarding the nonleading in @xmath90 terms , that is dropping the term @xmath116 in ( [ br ] ) , yields 0.065% br ( bj / k ) 0.095% [ brnc ] in good agreement with ( [ cleo ] ) .    yet , from this observation one can not conclude that the @xmath90-rule generally works in @xmath2 decays .",
    "the cleo analysis @xcite , for example , shows that factorization is consistent with the measurements provided the short distance coefficients @xmath117 and @xmath114 are replaced by two a priori unknown parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "similarly as in @xmath13 decays , these coefficients are found to be universal , at least on the basis of the two - body @xmath2 decays analysed so far .",

    "the present situation is very unsatisfactory and rather confusing .",

    "4c , has a discontinuity at @xmath157 connected with the four - quark intermediate state with the flavour combination @xmath158 .",
    "this is just the flavour composition of the virtual @xmath159 continuum in ( [ paras ] ) .",
    "it seems to be reasonable to again use the quark - hadron duality principle in order to cancel this piece of ( [ res ] ) against the unwanted hadronic contribution ( [ paras ] ) .",
    "practically , this results in neglecting the four - quark condensate diagram altogether .    from here on , we follow the usual procedure .",
    "we perform a borel transformation in @xmath160 and take moments in @xmath43 as is usually done in the charmonium channel .",
    "the momentum squared in the @xmath84-meson channel is kept fixed at @xmath161 . in order to take into account the higher states in the resulting sum rules we adopt for simplicity a two - resonance description in each of three channels , i.e. above the effective thresholds @xmath162 we describe the hadronic spectral functions by one effective resonance with a mass equal to @xmath163 . normalizing the matrix element ( [ nf ] ) so that the amplitude ( [ matr ] ) is proportional to combination a_2f_k^+=(c_2 + 3)f_k^+ + 2c_1  , [ final ] we obtain for the nonfactorizable contribution = -(0.045 - 0.075 )  .",
    "[ ftilde ] the range reflects our estimate of the uncertainty in the qcd calculation and the continuum subtraction .",
    "our analysis shows that the factorizable , nonleading in @xmath90 term and the nonfactorizable term in ( [ final ] ) are opposite in sign .",
    "quantitatively , the nonfactorizable matrix element is considerably smaller than the factorizable one , @xmath164 .",
    "nevertheless , the nonfactorizable contribution to the decay amplitude is very important because of the large coefficient , @xmath165 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath166 is close to the upper end of the range given in ( [ ftilde ] ) , the nonfactorizable contribution almost cancels the factorizable one proportional to @xmath116 , thus leading to the prediction ( [ brnc ] ) which agrees with experiment .",
    "this is exactly the scenario anticipated by employing the @xmath90-rule .",
    "at the same time , in our approach the nonfactorizable contributions are expected to be channel - dependent on quite general grounds .",
    "this expectation is corroborated by our preliminary analysis of other nonleptonic @xmath2-decays .",
    "in other words , as is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) there is no theoretical reason to expect a single universal value for the effective coefficient @xmath119 .",
    "even the sign of @xmath119 , depending on the sign of @xmath167 in a given channel , may vary .",
    "universality can at most be anticipated for certain classes of decay modes , such as @xmath168 or @xmath169 , etc .",
    "moreover , there is no simple relation between @xmath2 and @xmath13 decays in our approach since the ope for the corresponding correlation functions significantly differ in the relevant diagrams and in the hierarchy of mass scales .",
    "we hope to be able to clarify this issue further .",
    "theory seems to predict a much richer pattern in two - body weak decays than what is revealed by the present phenomenological approach to the data .",
    "we have discussed applications of qcd sum rules in different variants to form factors and exclusive decay amplitudes of @xmath2 mesons , both being important issues in @xmath2-physics .",
    "there are many other interesting aspects which can be studied in the framework of qcd sum rules and which have not been touched upon here .",
    "we just mention the dependence of form factors and couplings on the heavy quark mass . here , the sum rule technique can be employed complementarily to the heavy - quark effective theory . from a theoretical point of view , heavy - light bound states such as the @xmath2 meson are very suitable systems for studying the dynamics of the light quark and gluon degrees of freedom and for probing nonperturbative methods in qcd",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether or not the qcd sum rule technique passes these tests as successfully as the various tests in the past .",
    "for the time being , it is the only viable approach to some problems such as the calculation of weak decay amplitudes beyond factorization .",
    "even the capabilities of current lattice calculations do not allow to solve this problem ( as remarked in ref . [ 49 ] ) .",
