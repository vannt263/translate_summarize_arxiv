    "extended systems , as they are found in nature , often show complicated dynamics on several characteristic scales and times .",
    "one , often cited , example is turbulent motion , where the dynamics stretches from an integral scale to the dissipation scale . in many situations ,",
    "it is possible to find a low - order approximation of the dynamics and one remains with the task to describe the temporal behavior of the system under consideration .",
    "a standard example is the area of pattern formation @xcite where one ends up with systems of ordinary differential equations , describing the evolution of a few spatial modes .",
    "it is , however , not always possible to perform a mode decomposition , but nevertheless spatial structure is clearly present",
    ". then it makes sense to identify states and investigate the dynamics and interaction of these states .",
    "there exists a huge amount of works concerning deterministic @xcite , and stochastic modeling @xcite .",
    "examples for the above mentioned systems are found among others in climatology @xcite , oceanography @xcite , or ecosystems @xcite . in these examples ,",
    "one typically follows tracer particles that are put into the respective flow and performs some partitioning afterwards .",
    "we do not want to bother with this first , very subtle step of partitioning , rather we take the partition as given .",
    "on the other hand , there exist systems where one directly observes the temporal signal of several states , which can be coupled .",
    "a partitioning is then obviously not necessary and one is not bothered anymore with the problems arising from that point .",
    "examples are systems of coupled oscillators , coupled ode s . between the two described scenarios lie numerical simulations where it is often easy to identify spatial states by physical @xcite or mathematical @xcite arguments .",
    "often , one considers coupled systems with one dominant time scale and different typical amplitudes .",
    "states with fast oscillations are usually assumed to have small amplitude and are neglected .",
    "this way , small oscillations that might well play a role in inducing finite - size perturbations and chaos in a system are neglected . on the other hand , it can well appear that the fast fluctuations have large amplitude and thus obscure the slow states dynamics .",
    "chaoticity of nonlinear systems implies the loss of memory of a tracer that moves in the ( either extended or discrete ) system .",
    "it thus makes sense to use a statistical description . in this article",
    ", we present a way to treat systems with several states , which are possibly coupled and act on different time scales .",
    "we explain a method to filter time signals and extract information at different time scales along with a non - conventional , general method to construct a stochastic model capable to approximate the evolution of the system under observation .",
    "we end up with a statistical description of a multi time scale dynamics in terms of a markovian cascade process .",
    "the different time scales are identified and the dynamics is reconstructed in the statistical sense .",
    "this is done in order to compare the reconstructed and original dynamics by means of complexity measures and correlation functions to ensure that the modeling is senseful .",
    "apart from the theoretical interest about how to formulate a statistical model , we can figure out mainly two practical uses : firstly , one can implement a statistical model as a building block in geophysical or other large scale simulations to get an idea of the fast ( and possibly small ) scale fluctuations and secondly , on could use transition times and probabilities between different states to evaluate the most probable traces a passive scalar ( e.g. , a contaminant ) would have in the described flow ( e.g. , the atmosphere ) .    in this article",
    "we treat an example from geophysics : the chaotic dispersion process generated from a meandering jet model . apart from the interest in itself ,",
    "we believe that this system is worth noting for the following reasons : _",
    "i ) _ it shows chaos and mixing on two time scales as desired by our research goal ( and thus represents some minimal setting giving the possibility for detailed studies of the methods we developed ) , _ ii ) _ it is typical for geophysical applications _",
    "iii ) _ we can compare results explicitly , since there exists an older article attempting to solve the task with conventional methods .",
    "the article is organized as follows : after this brief introduction , we present in section [ section : model ] the model , in section [ section : entropy - and - filtering ] the analysis method is explained , in section [ section : construction ] the construction of the model trajectory is described , section [ section : results ] contains the results and the comparison of constructed and original signal , finally we end with a short discussion and some conclusions in section [ section : discussion ] .",

    "the model serves our purposes , since it can be well used as the test case in which only two characteristic times are involved as we will see below ( i.e. fast and slow particle transitions across the flow ) . in this model ,",

    "the trajectory consists of fast oscillations between one of the gyres and the jet , interleaved by periods where it stays in one of the gyres for a longer time .",

    "the aim of this section is the presentation of a suitable filtering technique which allows to highlight and characterize the dynamical features at different characteristic times .",
    "this filtering method , developed on the basis of an exit time approach to entropy computation , is a way to understand how to find a good stochastic model for the process .",
    "let us consider the time signal of an observable @xmath23 .",
    "typically @xmath23 is registered at a certain sampling rate @xmath24 , i.e. , we consider a discrete time evolution , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "a coarse - grained description of @xmath25 is obtained by dividing the range of @xmath25 through a partition with , say , @xmath27 elements , and assigning a label to each element of the partition , say @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the time evolution of @xmath25 is mapped into a symbolic dynamics @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "let us indicate with @xmath31 a generic symbol of the sequence and with @xmath32 the lifetime of @xmath31 , i.e. , the time the system takes to move from the state @xmath31 into a new one .",
    "we will use sometimes the terms residence time or exit time as a synonym for `` lifetime '' when more suitable , in the context of markov chains , the term waiting time is used ( mainly in the literature of queuing systems ) .",
    "a sequence of length @xmath33 is designated as follows : @xmath34 for example , imagine a signal @xmath35 which assumes positive integer values at each unit time step ( @xmath36 ) ; then the corresponding @xmath37 variables are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "let us briefly remind some recent results concerning the development of the estimation of entropy using the exit - time approach @xcite . to illustrate the basic ideas we describe the method and afterwards discuss its application to the problem under consideration , some details are explained in the appendix .    out of the set of sequences",
    "@xmath40 we collect statistics for each subsequence @xmath41 and construct the probability distribution @xmath42 .",
    "now , one can compute the shannon entropy @xmath43 of the signal @xmath31 by the following identity : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the shannon entropy of @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( the information production with @xmath33 ) , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the average life time , is computed as @xmath50 denoting the entropies of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 sequences with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , one can determine upper and lower bounds on the entropy : @xmath53 <",

    "let us now introduce a procedure to select the temporal behavior `` slower than a given frequency ''",
    ". the filter should therefore be able to discard the many fast fluctuations from one state to another which occur very frequently ( see figure [ fig : signal_kw ] , top line ) .",
    "we call this filter `` killing window '' ; it operates in the following way .",
    "if the signal fluctuates from one state into another state before returning to the first state , and if this fluctuation lasts for a shorter time than @xmath54 ( the filter length of the killing window ) , this fluctuation is ignored .",

    "note that is also effectively prolongs the slower oscillations , c.f .  fig .",
    "[ fig : kw ] .        , from top to bottom .",
    "it is evident how the fast fluctuations are removed by the killing window . for a very long killing window , @xmath57 ,",
    "also the residence in the jet is killed , and the model has effectively only two states.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    with this filtering procedure applied to the original signal @xmath46 , we obtain a filtered sequence @xmath58 , for which we can compute the entropy @xmath59 using ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "we used for simplicity a filter that acts backwards in time .",
    "it is however not difficult to redefine the filter such as to be invariant under time reversal , the result remains the same within an error of the fast time scale .",
    "the observed signal varies over two very distant characteristic time scales , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "thus , information at the slower time scale can be extracted if @xmath62 , because due to the second inequality almost all fast oscillations are killed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_n - comp]a the convergence of the entropy , at varying the block size , for a killing window of length 2 is shown , together with the upper and lower bounds from ( [ bounds ] ) .",
    "first of all we see that the entropy lies nicely in between the upper and the lower bounds . for a killing window of length 2",
    "this is not surprising , as most of the transitions are fast oscillations between jet and gyre .",
    "however , this entropy converges after @xmath63 , which means that one needs a second order markovian process in order to properly describe this process .",
    "let us stress that now the state of the system is given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , therefore a markov model of order @xmath64 corresponds , in the original space of the symbols @xmath65 , to a markov model of order @xmath66 .",
    "the entropy based only on the residence times , @xmath67 , is larger , and thus constitutes the effective lower bound for the total entropy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h_n - comp]b this is shown for the bare signal , and for killing windows of a length from 2 to 20 .",
    "this entropy based on the residence times has converged immediately , which means that the residence times are basically uncorrelated .",

    "the killing window clearly destroys information .",
    "if the loss of information is proportional to the filter length , obviously the process is homogeneous ( with respect to information loss ) within the time scale we are considering .",
    "this is analogous to the information production rate which has to converge to a constant to find the entropy of a chaotic system .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h - vs - kw ] we display the entropy loss depending on the filter length .",
    "for @xmath69 we have certainly reached convergence and thus the process can be described at the level of one single scale ( namely the slow one ) . for completeness , we remark that almost all information is destroyed if the filter length exceeds the typical slow time scale , @xmath70 .",
    "we have a constant rate of information loss and thus the difference between the different filter lengths is zero .",
    "this in turn justifies the description of the process by one scale only.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this section we will demonstrate how the analysis of the signal can be applied to construct a markovian model , which can generate stochastic symbolic sequences with the same statistics as the original signal",
    ". the model should be able to reproduce both the slow and fast transitions .",
    "this is accomplished by first reproducing the slow scale signal , and then nesting the fast transitions into that one .",
    "we thus define a `` horizontal '' and a `` vertical '' dependence , the first describes the process on a specific time scale ( slow or fast ) , the latter models the interdependencies between the different time scales .",
    "both are assumed to be markovian of first order , as our preceding analysis has shown , a generalization is straightforward . in the following , for the sake of clarity , we will use capital letters for slow scale and small ones for the fast scale .      as determined by the entropic analysis ,",
    "the slow signal is the one filtered by a killing window of length @xmath71 .",
    "the construction rules are the following : + i ) given an entering state @xmath72 the process selects according to the transition probability matrix @xmath73 its next state @xmath74 .",
    "+ ii)given that selection of the transition @xmath75 , the time spent in @xmath76 before jumping to @xmath77 is given by the random variable @xmath78 , which in turn possesses the distribution @xmath79 .",
    "both needed informations are obtained from the filtered signal . by the given rules , we recognize that the construction concentrates on the _ transitions _ between states , rather than on the state itself . the _ lifetime _ of the states depends only on this transition",
    ", we see that the transition matrix does not include self - loops , like @xmath80 and thus has zeroes on the diagonal . in the case of independent lifetimes , i.e. , exponential distribution , one can interchange steps i ) and ii ) and first select a state .",
    "numerical examples for the matrices and residence times are given section [ section : results ] .",
    "the reconstruction corresponds to a random traveler on a graph , which stays in each node with a certain node - characteristic time and then jumps over an edge to the next node according to a prescribed hopping probability .      up to now",
    ", the construction is rather standard .",
    "a new thing we introduce is the vertical connection between scales .",
    "the dynamics of the fast scale shall depend on the slow one , but apart from that be a first order markovian process as described above by the rules i ) and ii ) .",
    "the two quantities we have to consider are the pdf of the lifetimes @xmath81 and the transition probabilities @xmath82 . both can be quite different from the slow processes quantities .",
    "one obvious condition on the lifetimes is , that the duration of the fast states time intervals should not exceed the slow ones .",
    "this is fulfilled , since we anticipated a clear separation of time scales . in general",
    ", the transitions will be hit with an uncertainty of @xmath83 .",
    "this in accordance with the filtering analysis , which is only accurate up to the filter length .",
    "the lifetime distribution function @xmath84 can be taken without any restrictions from the analysis , since we anticipate the times to be independent from each other ( as confirmed for our example , see next section ) .",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath82 , however , have to be conditioned on the slow scale transitions and thus we have to write them for a complete description as @xmath85 .",
    "results are given in the next section .",
    "we want to remark , again , that a first order in the space @xmath86 corresponds to a very high order in the space @xmath65 with conventional time sampling . for our illustration by the traveler on a graph",
    "we imagine the traveler moving with his own , slow speed , being accompanied by his dog which moves forth and back between the present node of the traveler and some other nodes he s allowed to visit .",
    "the dog rests only for short times in the nodes , and thus effectively moves at a fast time scale .    in conclusion",
    ", we have to find for each of the transitions @xmath75 the according fast transition probability @xmath85 .",
    "the fast process evolves then with the rules from @xmath85 and the lifetime statistics @xmath87 within the window between two transitions .    in a generalized model , @xmath88 different time scales",
    "are involved , then we order the processes from slowest to fastest time and construct the hierarchy by nesting the scale @xmath33 into scale @xmath89 .",
    "this generalization is straightforward and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "another generalization concerns markov processes of higher order .",
    "this requires accurate bookkeeping of the dependencies but in principle is straightforward , too .",
    "in this section we will present how the technique described above compares to the real signal .",
    "the slow scale transition matrix , we obtain for our model @xmath90 note that due the symmetries of the meandering jet problem , this matrix could in principle be reduced to only its upper half . in general , this is however not the case .",
    "since we have a very simple system with strong restrictions the fast transition matrices look simple , e.g. , for @xmath91 : @xmath92    the residence times for the slow and fast scale are displayed in fig .  [ fig : pdfs ] .",
    "clearly they are very close to be exponential .",
    "this is a sign of a non - correlated process , which has also been found by the entropic analysis . from a fit to an exponential distribution , we determine the mean residence time for the slow time scale to be @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for the fast time scale we obtain @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "for our example of a coarse grained spatial system , the trajectory , basically slowly drifts forth and back between north and south gyre , crossing the jet . during this evolution",
    ", fluctuations occur about the boundaries of the states .",
    "take , e.g. ,  a trajectory starting at the northern gyre . having made the transition to the jet on the slow scale , still , fast fluctuations will occur between the gyre and the jet , thus masking the signal as in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal_kw ] .",
    "if the trajectory evolves towards the southern gyre , the fluctuations will happen only between southern gyre and jet .",
    "this does not at all conflict with a probabilistic interpretation : the signal chooses randomly , according to the transition matrix and lifetime distribution a new state and lifetime .",
    "information about history and details of the space evolution are forgotten ( up to 1st order ) .",
    "this is the natural result of the coarse graining .",
    "the fast fluctuations are again random and follow their description with matrices and lifetimes . in our case , we find the trivial transition matrices , like in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fast - matrix ] ) due to the simplicity of the meandering jet system . in general",
    ", however , more complicated scenarios will appear .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal - comp]b we show the signal for @xmath97 and a model trajectory for the same parameters , as constructed by our method .",
    "in contrast to an older work @xcite the signals resemble each other a lot , for comparison these results are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal - comp]a",
    ".        now we present some more quantitative comparisons .",
    "the first quantity to check is the information contained in the signals , it should be approximately the same , especially if we consider that this has been the main tool to find the models order . in fig .",
    "[ fig : entr - comp ] the comparison for @xmath98 and @xmath99 is shown  we find an excellent agreement .",
    "finally we check for the correlation function as the standard tool to investigate dependencies within the signal .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cf - comp ] .",
    "the general behavior for the correlation functions is the same .",
    "it seems that the reconstructed ones slightly underestimate the correlations in the signal .",
    "there are two mechanisms leading to deviations of the construction from the original : firstly , the result depends sensitively on the correct estimation of the time scales involved in the original signal and secondly , the approximation of the pdf for the residence times by an exponential is nothing exact , nevertheless , the coincidence is remarkably good , taking into account the possible error sources . for real - world applications ,",
    "one should naturally calculate the pdf numerically and use the stored values .     and the corresponding reconstructed signal .",
