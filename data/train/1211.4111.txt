    "the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization approach @xcite is a systematic theoretical tool to study the production and decay of heavy quarkonia . in this approach ,",
    "the production rate for a heavy quarkonium in a high - energy process is expressed as a linear combination of nrqcd long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) for a heavy - quark - antiquark ( @xmath8 ) pair into the physical quarkonium @xmath9 .",
    "the velocity - scaling rules of nrqcd classify the numerical importance of each ldme relative to the color - singlet one in powers of @xmath3 , the velocity of the quark and antiquark in the @xmath8 rest frame .",
    "the corresponding short - distance factors are calculable perturbatively . while the production of a quarkonium in hadron colliders involves various channels with the @xmath8 pair whose quantum number @xmath10 differs from that of @xmath9 , an exclusive quarkonium production process in @xmath11 annihilation such as @xmath12 or @xmath13",
    "is dominated by the color - singlet process in which a produced @xmath14 pair has the same quantum number as that of a final - state quarkonium .",
    "this greatly reduces theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the factorization theorem for some exclusive quarkonium production processes in @xmath11 annihilation is available @xcite , although that for the inclusive quarkonium production is still a conjecture .",
    "the only exclusive quarkonium production process that has been observed at @xmath7 factories is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "right after the first observation , it was revealed that the measured production rate @xcite is greater than the leading - order ( lo ) nrqcd results @xcite by an order of magnitude .",
    "although the subsequent measured values have decreased @xcite in comparison with the first measurement , the discrepancy still remained . through extensive theoretical studies on the corrections at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling @xmath16 @xcite and the resummed relativistic corrections @xcite , it was found that the interplay of the large qcd and relativistic corrections fill the gap between the theory and data @xcite within uncertainties .",
    "a recent result for the order-@xmath17 corrections also supports this conclusion  @xcite .",
    "however , some subtle issues that should be clarified still exist : the current experimental data for @xmath15 contain the events with a @xmath18 pair plus at least two charged tracks as the decay product of the @xmath19 .",
    "if we take into account the @xmath19 decay modes without charged tracks , then the actual cross section can be larger than the current data .",
    "while the size of the relativistic corrections has been estimated rather precisely with the aid of the resummation technique , the qcd corrections were computed only at order @xmath16 .",
    "the amount of higher - order ( ho ) qcd corrections are not estimated yet .",
    "another interesting issue is regarding the color - singlet ldmes .",
    "the color - singlet ldmes are usually determined by comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions for the electromagnetic decays of the @xmath20-wave charmonia , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that the relativistic corrections to the charmonium decay rates are significant . in order to determine the color - singlet ldmes including the relativistic corrections to these electromagnetic decays , we need at least two constraints for each decay rate .",
    "one is the experimental decay rate . as for the other constraint",
    ", one may choose the generalized gremm - kapustin relation  @xcite that relates the ldmes of lo and ho  @xcite .",
    "as an alternative , one can use the measured rate @xmath23 $ ] for the @xmath24 decay into light hadrons ( lh ) @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical values for the ldmes have a strong dependence on the choice : the lo ldme for @xmath24 at @xmath25gev is @xmath26gev@xmath27  @xcite and @xmath28gev@xmath27  @xcite",
    ". the corresponding values for @xmath29 are @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31  @xcite . therefore , the phenomenological study on the exclusive quarkonium production rate in @xmath11 annihilation may provide us with a good chance of improving the accuracies in the determination of the color - singlet ldmes .",
    "an accurate determination of the color - singlet ldmes may lead to improving the determinations of various color - octet ldmes that are involved in the inclusive productions of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "one may also consider exclusive @xmath20-wave quarkonium processes in @xmath11 annihilation other than the observed one @xmath32 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the process @xmath33 was first introduced as a possible source of contaminating the data samples for @xmath32 .",
    "the angular - distribution analysis of the @xmath32 events at belle showed that there were no such contaminations .",
    "in addition , the belle collaboration has not observed the signals for @xmath33 yet and only an upper bound of the cross section has been reported : @xmath34%   \\times \\mathcal{b}_{>2}[j/\\psi]%   <   9.1 $ ] fb @xcite . according to the qcd nlo correction in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nlo corrected cross section is significantly smaller than the lo prediction . as is stated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the process is dominated by the photon fragmentation .",
    "the relativistic and qcd corrections to this contribution can be summed effectively by making use of the vector - meson - dominance ( vmd ) approach @xcite .",
    "the cross section within the vmd approach is @xmath35=1.69\\pm 0.35$]fb at the center - of - momentum ( cm ) energy @xmath2gev @xcite , which is significantly smaller than the lo prediction and is consistent with the nonobservation of the process at belle .",
    "the production of a charge - conjugation parity @xmath36 quarkonium associated with a photon , @xmath37 , was first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite as a nice probe to the color - singlet mechanism of nrqcd and the convergence of relativistic corrections , especially for @xmath38 .",
    "later , both the qcd nlo and relativistic corrections to this process were calculated and found to be considerable  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the resummed relativistic correction and its interplay with the qcd nlo correction to the exclusive processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath2gev . because the qcd nlo and relativistic corrections to @xmath15 are large",
    ", one may guess that the two processes listed above may also acquire significant corrections relative to the lo contribution .",
    "our calculation reveals that the corrections are indeed large negative .",
    "the resummation of relativistic corrections enhances the cross section for @xmath0 in comparison with the order-@xmath29 relativistic correction . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "the qcd nlo and relativistic corrections resummed to all orders in @xmath3 make the cross section negative within the standard nrqcd factorization approach . by employing the vmd approach to compute the photon - fragmentation contribution , we cure the problem .",
    "the result shows that the qcd ho corrections may have significant contributions to @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , these two exclusive processes may provide us with independent phenomenological constraints to the color - singlet nrqcd ldmes for the @xmath20-wave charmonia .",

    "in this section , we list the nrqcd factorization formula for the cross sections of @xmath40 and @xmath33 , and summarize the strategy of resumming relativistic corrections .      according to the nrqcd factorization formalism @xcite , the cross sections for the exclusive processes @xmath40 and @xmath33 can be expressed as :    [ fac - sigma ] @xmath41 & = & \\sum_n\\frac{f_n}{m_c^5 } \\langle   \\mathcal{o}_n^{\\eta_c }   \\rangle , \\\\ \\sigma [ e^+e^-\\to j/\\psi+j/\\psi ] & = & \\sum_{m , n}\\frac{f_{m , n}}{m_c^8 } \\langle   \\mathcal{o}_m^{j/\\psi }   \\rangle \\langle   \\mathcal{o}_n^{j/\\psi }   \\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 is the nrqcd ldme for production of a quarkonium @xmath9 from a @xmath43 pair with a spectroscopic state @xmath10 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are dimensionless perturbative short - distance coefficients that are independent of the long - distance nature of @xmath9 , and",
    "@xmath46 is the charm - quark mass .",
    "in general , the quantum number for @xmath43 does not have to be the same as that for the quarkonium @xmath9 and the numerical importance of a @xmath43 channel relative to the color - singlet channel is classified in powers of @xmath3 in the velocity - scaling rules of nrqcd . in the exclusive process ( [ fac - sigma ] ) , @xmath43 channels with the quantum number identical to that of @xmath9 contribute dominantly .",
    "thus the series ( [ fac - sigma ] ) can be well approximated by the relativistic corrections and the index @xmath10 can be understood as the power in @xmath29 relative to the lo color - singlet nrqcd ldme @xmath47 . the expression ( [ fac - sigma ] )",
    "can further be simplified once we apply the vacuum - saturation approximation to express the production ldme in terms of the corresponding decay ldme @xmath48 : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the total - angular - momentum quantum number of @xmath9 . in the coulomb gauge ,",

    "we have employed the vmd approach to include the qcd and relativistic corrections to the photon-@xmath24 vertex in the photon - fragmentation diagrams .",
    "the vmd result @xmath207fb , given in table  [ table3 ] , indeed resolves the problem of negative cross section and the prediction is insensitive to the scale @xmath202 .",
    "this is a strong indication that corrections of order higher than @xmath201 may have significant contributions .",
    "the predicted cross section for @xmath208 is consistent with the nonobservation of the events at belle .",
