    "it is well established from iras studies that many interacting galaxies show enhanced far - infrared ( fir ) emission compared to non - interacting galaxies ( lonsdale et al .",
    "1984 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1987 ; telesco et al .",
    "most of the emission is due to young massive stars formed in recent starbursts , supporting the idea that galaxy - galaxy interactions can stimulate active star formation ( larson & tinsley 1978 ; rieke et al . 1980 ; condon et al .",
    "1982 ; balzano 1983 ; gehrz et al .",
    "1983 ; joseph et al .",
    "1984 ; cutri & mcalary 1985 ) ; albeit , dust - obscured agns might be responsible for the emission in some cases ( sanders et al .",
    "1988a ; surace & sanders 1999 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al . 1998 ) . the most extreme fir luminosities",
    "( @xmath1 ; h@xmath2=75 km / s mpc@xmath3 ) and highest dust temperatures are found in galaxy mergers where the identity of the component galaxies is often indeterminate ( sanders et al .",
    "1988a ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ; mazzarella et al . 1991 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . after these ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) , violent starbursts are most likely to be found in closely interacting pairs of spiral galaxies with overlapping disks such as arp  244 ( the antennae ) .",
    "these pairs dominate the fir luminosity function between @xmath4  @xmath5 ( xu & sulentic 1991 ) .",
    "there is clear evidence in the recent deep surveys carried out at : 1 ) optical / uv / nir wavelengths by hst ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; williams et al . 1998 ; thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) , 2 ) mir / fir wavelengths by iso ( elbaz et al . 1999",
    "; puget et al . 1999 ) , and 3 ) submm wavelengths by scuba ( blain et al . 1999 ) , that much of the evolution in the history of star formation in the universe is related to starbursts in closely interacting / merging systems .",
    "therefore it is of great interest to understand _ how _ the enhanced star formation ( starburst ) is stimulated in these system .",
    "the question of _ how _ starbursts are stimulated in interacting galaxies , leads directly to the more fundamental question of how the star formation is modulated in galaxies ( kennicutt 1989 , 1998 ; hunter et al . 1998 ; wyse & silk 1987 ; dopita 1985 ) . since stars are formed from gas , an obvious necessary condition for a galaxy to be star - formation active",
    "is that it should contain significant gas . on the other hand",
    ", it appears that interacting galaxies have in general higher star formation rates ( sfrs ) not because they have more gas than isolated galaxies , but because the star formation rate per unit gas mass ( the so called star formation efficiency ) is much higher ( young et al . 1986 , 1989 ; solomon & sage 1988 ; sanders et al .",
    "1991 ) . as pointed out by kennicutt ( 1998 ) in his discussion of the schmidt law ( sfr@xmath6 , n@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the gas surface density )",
    ", the higher efficiency in starbursts in interacting galaxies may simply be a consequence of their much higher gas densities ( scoville et al .",
    "1994 ; solomon et al . 1997 ; gao & solomon 1999 ; bryant & scoville 1999 ) . unusually high gas density , which occurs almost exclusively in the nuclei of interacting galaxies and mergers , is certainly an interaction related phenomenon .",
    "interaction induced gas inflow is predicted by simulations and is due either to the higher gas viscosity ( caused by more frequent cloud - cloud collisions in interacting galaxies : olson & kwan 1991a ; struck 1997 ) , or to the torque imposed on the gas by an interaction induced stellar - bar ( barnes & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "if enhanced star formation in interacting galaxies is due to higher gas density , which has a simple physical interpretation related to the growth rate of gravitational perturbation ( kennicutt 1998 ) , two predictions can be made :    1 .   interaction induced starbursts should concentrate in the nuclear region .",
    "2 .   starbursts in interacting systems of later stages ( before the majority of the gas is converted to stars ) should be stronger than those in early stages , because the later the stage , the more gas will sink into the nuclei .",
    "as far as the ulirgs are concerned , these two predictions seem to be in good agreement with the observations ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) .",
    "all ulirgs appear to be in or close to the final stage of the merger process ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1991 ; murphy et a. 1996 ; clements et al . 1996 ; clements and baker 1996 ; mihos & bothun 1998 ) .",
    "the starbursts they harbor are primarily in the nuclear regions .",
    "mihos & bothun ( 1998 ) noted a trend between dynamical age and @xmath9 concentration in the ulirgs they observed which is consistent with the physical scenario behind the two predictions .",
    "statistical studies of a large pair sample ( xu & sulentic ( 1991 ) demonstrated that a subsample of closely interacting spiral - spiral pairs ( hereafter clo ss ) with : a ) separations less than a component diameter and b ) showing optical signs of interaction , exhibit higher mean fir  to  optical luminosity and fir color ratios .",
    "this fir excess exists not only with respect to isolated galaxies but relative to other pairs as well ( see also telesco et al .",
    "1988 ; jones & stein 1989 ; mazzarella et al .",
    "this result is again in line with prediction ( 2 ) , because the small separations ( normalized to the primary component diameter ) of clo ss pairs suggests that they may often be in a more advanced evolutionary state of a merger sequence compared to other ss pairs ( hwang et al .",
    ". it should be noted , though , that : 1 ) since final coallescence usually requires several encounters between a pair of galaxies ( barnes & hernquest 1996 , 1998 ) and 2 ) since the orbital geometry of interacting systems is complicated , there is no one - to - one mapping between component separation and interaction stage .",
    "however , there is a clear tendency for the apoapsis of the orbit to decrease rapidly after the first encounter ( barnes & hernquest 1998 ) .",
    "this suggests that _ the later the stage , the more chance for the two galaxies to remain close together_. on the other hand , the lack of one - to - one mapping between component separation and interaction stage for individual galaxy pairs ( coupled with the projection effect ) may be the reason for the absence of a monotonic dependence between starburst strength and separation , especially for pairs with wider separations ( e.g. fig.12 and fig14 of xu & sulentic 1991 ; see also keel 1993 ) .    contradicting prediction ( 1 ) , some famous examples of the clo ss pairs such as arp  244 ( hummel & van del hulst 1986 ; vigroux et al .",
    "1996 ; mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) and arp  299 ( gerhz et al . 1980 ; hibbard & yun 1998 ) show bright extranuclear starbursts in the overlap region , possibly due to interpenetrating collisions between components ( jog & solomon 1992 ) . indeed , the simulation of mihos et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which modeled star formation in arp  244 with a prescription similar to the schmidt law , failed to reproduce the overlap starburst .",
    "this motivates the following two questions :    1 .   are overlap and other extranuclear starbursts common in clo ss pairs",
    "? 2 .   if yes , then which starburst mode is the more important in clo ss pairs , nuclear or overlap starbursts ?",
    "one must map the star formation distribution in these systems with spatial resolutions much better than iras in order to answer these questions . on the other hand , since dust extinction in interacting galaxies can be very large ( gehrz et al .",
    "1983 ; kunze et al .",
    "1996 ) , optical star formation mapping may not provide reliable results .",
    "these considerations motivated us to map a sample of clo ss pairs with overlapping disks using two instruments ( iso  cam and iso  phot ) on board of the infrared space observatory ( kessler et al . 1996 ) .",
    "iso - sws spectroscopic observations were also made for some pairs ( pointing both to the nuclei and to the overlap regions ) .",
    "the imaging observations provided higher angular resolutions than iras and orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than kao ( e.g. bushouse et al .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that presents and analyzes the iso observations .",
    "we report the first results of iso  cam and iso  sws observations , comparing them with results from new ground based h@xmath0 observations .",
    "iso  phot results and a more quantitative multiwavelength analysis will be presented in a following paper .",
    "the pair sample was selected from two catalogues :    \\1 .",
    "catalogue of isolated pairs of galaxies in the northern sky ( dec.@xmath10 deg ) by karachentsev ( 1972 ) , hereafter kpg ;    \\2 .",
    "atlas of peculiar galaxies ( dec .",
    "@xmath11 deg ) by arp ( 1966 ) .",
    "the sample selection criteria were :    \\(1 ) spiral  spiral pairs with overlapping disks ;    \\(2 ) pair component redshift difference @xmath12v@xmath13 500 km s@xmath3 ;    \\(3 ) pairs showing one of the three interaction morphology classes defined in the kpg ( lin = bridges and/or tails , atm = common halo , or dis = distortion in one or both components ) ;    \\(4 ) major axis diameter of the primary component d@xmath14 ;    \\(5 ) a pair luminosity ratio @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the integrated iras fir ( 82.5 @xmath17 ) luminosity ( helou et al .",
    "1988 ) and @xmath18 is the combined monochromatic luminosity ( @xmath19 ) at 4400 estimated from the photographic magnitudes .    criterion ( 1 ) restricts the sample to galaxy pairs with overlapping disks so that we can assess the role of overlap starbursts .",
    "this differs from the criterion used to define clo ss pairs in xu & sulentic ( 1991 ) which included systems with projected separations up to one primary component diameter .",
    "criterion ( 4 ) restricts the sample to relatively nearby pairs and insuring that the chosen sample could be resolved by iso  phot ( beamwidth @xmath20@xmath21 at 60 and 100@xmath22 ) .",
    "the final criterion selects ss pairs with fir / b @xmath23 2@xmath24 the isolated spiral mean ( @xmath25 , xu & sulentic 1991 ) .",
    "this is also at least 2@xmath26 above the mean @xmath27 for normal spiral galaxies studied by corbelli et al .",
    "our sample is biased towards fir enhanced ss pairs in order to minimize the chance of including false clo ss pairs ( wide pairs or accordant chance alignments ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that although fir / b is a good measure of starburst strength ( xu & de zotti 1989 ) it is affected by several factors relatively unrelated to starburst activity including b - band extinction and diffuse fir cirrus emission .",
    "our original sample contained ten clo ss pairs but two ( arp  263 and kpg  536 ) were dropped because of poor iso visibility parameters .",
    "basic properties for our sample of eight clo ss pairs are presented in table 1 .",
    "the 9.7@xmath17 cam images were obtained with the lw7 filter .",
    "they give information about the ( 9.7@xmath17 ) silicon feature and facilitate comparisons with higher resolution ground - based ( 10@xmath17 ) maps from the literature ( e.g. gehrz et al .",

    "these maps were expected to be significantly more sensitive than the 9.7 @xmath17 observations because the filter had a broader bandpass and because the sources were expected to be brighter at longer wavelength ( less extinction and more emission ) . with a resolution of @xmath28",
    "these cam images reveal structures as small as a few kpc in our sample where typical distances are @xmath29 ( h@xmath2=75 km / s mpc@xmath3 ) .",

    "this is another direct indication that the physical conditions of active star formation in ngc  520b are similar to those observed in arp  244 and 299 , the other two sources in our first subgroup .",
    "what is special about the overlap region ? it is the actual interface region of a disk - disk collision .",
    "an overlap starburst could then be triggered by direct collisions between giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ( noguchi 1991 ) . at the same time",
    "this mechanism may not be very efficient because the galactic disk filling factor of gmcs is very low ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "jog & solomon ( 1992 ) proposed a more efficient model where collisions between h  i clouds lead to the formation of a hot ionized , high - pressure remnant gas .",
    "the over - pressure due to this hot gas causes a radiative shock compression of the outer layers of existing gmcs in the overlap region .",
    "these layers become gravitationally unstable and trigger a burst of massive star formation in the initially barely stable gmcs .",
    "this model can be tested with x - ray observations of the hot remnant gas .",
    "high resolution rosat observations of arp  244 ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1997 ) revealed x - ray emission in the overlap region .",
    "however , given the morphology of the x - ray emission ( localized , point - source like ) , it is more likely due to supernova remnants associated with the on - going starburst rather than a hot remnant gas which would be more diffuse . the x - ray emission and star formation associated with the ongoing collision in stephan s quintet ( pietsch et al .",
    "1997 ; xu et al . 1999 ; sulentic et al .",
    "2000 ) may be closer to this situation .",
    "future higher resolution axaf observations could provide more definite results .    if cloud - cloud collisions can indeed trigger star formation ( scoville et al . 1986 ; olson & kwan 1991ab ) then this may be a mechanism ( in addition to the gas - density dependence of star formation rate ) for interaction induced star formation enhancements in general .",
    "simulations ( olson & kwan 1991ab ; noguchi & ishibashi 1986 ; noguchi 1988 , 1991 ) have shown that cloud - cloud collisions are significantly enhanced throughout the disk due to the orbit - crossing of gas clouds triggered by gravitational perturbations . this may provide an interpretation for more widely distributed star formation , that shows more moderate enhancement , in `` less disturbed '' clo pairs .",
    "it is interesting to compare the overlap starbursts in arp  299 ( source c - c in gehrz et al .",
    "1983 ) and arp  244 ( source a in vigroux et al .",
    "table 6 gives the mir fluxes of overlap starbursts and galactic nuclei for these two systems .",
    "the overlap starburst in arp  244 is significantly brighter than both nuclei combined ! on the other hand , the overlap starburst in arp  299 is much fainter than either of the component nuclei .",
    "one possible reason for this difference is that the two pairs are in different stages of the merging process .",
    "arp  299 may be in a later merging stage where more gas has fallen into the galactic nuclei powering intensive starbursts ( especially in ic  694 ; casoli et al . 1999 ) .",
    "interaction kinematics may also play a role in arp  299 where ic  694 is undergoing a retrograde encounter ( augarde & lequeux 1985 ; hibbard & yun 1999 ) .",
    "this apparently allows it to retain most of its gas which is then available to the nucleus as fuel for the violent starburst . on the other hand ,",
    "both disks in arp  244 are undergoing prograde encounters ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; mihos et al .",
    "1993 ) , and the gas disks have suffered severe disruption ( barnes & hernquist 1996 , 1998 ) with much of the gas moved away from the central regions ( van der hulst 1979 ; gao et al . 1998 ; grundl et al .",
    "the highest gas concentration is , in fact , found in the overlap region ( stanford et al .",
    "1990 ; gao et al . 1998 ; grundl et al .",
    "it is possible that such a gas distribution is unstable and transient ( retardation of infall ) which might be the reason why such bright overlap starbursts are rare .",
    "our third clo ss subgroup shows a modest fir enhancement but less structural distortion and more extended star formation .",
    "these properties are consistent with the hypothesis that they are in an earlier interaction stage than the first two subgroups .",
    "the absence of overlap starbursts in these may indicate that a disk - disk collision has not yet occurred .",
    "although no firm conclusion can be reached about their physical separation , the calculation of xu & sulentic ( 1991 , appendix a ) shows that components in most close pairs are physically proximate ( physical separation @xmath75 diameter of the primary ) .",
    "examination of component morphologies in kpg  426 , the pair with components most clearly separated in our sample , and consideration of simulations ( e.g. toomre & toomre 1972 ) , suggest that the components are well separated .",
    "there is , at the same time , evidence that less disturbed systems may have unfavorable interaction geometries .",
    "two out of three pairs in subgroup three may be undergoing either retrograde or highly inclination encounters ( the situation for arp  276 is less clear ) .",
    "we suggest that the following sequence of sources of increasing star formation efficiency : isolated galaxies  wide pairs ",
    "closely interacting pairs ",
    "ulirgs , may be viewed as an evolutionary sequence for mergers .",
    "results in this paper show further that , within the population of closely interacting pairs ( clo ss ) , the less disturbed systems may be in earlier stages of interaction and have less enhanced star formation activity compared to severely disturbed systems and advanced mergers.    at the same time , clo ss pairs show a large scatter in star formation indicators such as @xmath27 and @xmath88 ratios ( xu & sulentic 1991 ) . even among sources from the same subgroups in this study there is a wide range in star formation activity indicators ( such as fir / b ) .",
    "arp  244 , one of the advance mergers , shows fir / b lower than the less disturbed systems and one of the lowest @xmath89 ratios in interacting systems ( gao et al .",
    "one explanation for the large scatter in star formation indicators involves variations in galaxy gas content .",
    "galaxies with less gas have less fuel for starbursts which is consistent with previous results ( sulentic 1989 ; xu & sulentic 1991 ) which found that ss pairs show higher fir emission than normal galaxies but little fir emission from pairs of early type galaxies ( e / s0 ) which are gas poor .",
    "differences in gas content between clo ss pairs with strong and weak star formation enhancement will be an interesting area of study for future h  i and co surveys of galaxy pairs .",
    "a surprising lack of h  i gas depletion was found in a statistical study of an fir enhanced sample of e+s pairs ( zasov & sulentic 1994 ) .    even within a sample of gas",
    "rich pairs significant differences in their star formation rates are found .",
    "this is true even for galaxies with the same gas surface density where the `` star formation efficiency '' can differ by as much as an order of magnitude ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 of solomon & sage 1988 ) .",
    "much of this scatter may reflect the episodic nature of starbursts .",
    "several physical mechanisms may contribute to this episodic behavior .",
    "feed - back from massive star formation ( such as supernovae explosions and stellar winds ) may quench a burst after a few 10@xmath90 yr ( krgel & tutukov 1993 ) .",
    "this effectively breaks the interaction induced star formation into pulses which is confirmed by observations : all starburst durations derived from observation ( rieke et al .",
    "1980 ; gehrz et al .",
    "1983 ; bernlhr 1993a ) are on the order of a few times 10@xmath90 years even though interactions typically last for several 10@xmath76 years ( e.g. hibbard & yun 1999 ) .",
    "when an interacting galaxy is observed in the off stage , only a post - starburst is seen ( examples can be found in bernlhr 1993a ) .",
    "a post - starburst , with most of the ob stars already gone , will have a much reduced effect on star formation indicators ( e.g. fir and h@xmath0 emissions ) .",
    "as demonstrated by the simulations of noguchi ( 1991 ) , the periodic orbital motion which swings the two galaxies back and forth relative to each other several times before they eventually merge , will induce sharp peaks ( corresponding to the passages of periapses ) in the cloud - cloud collision rate which in turn may also cause pulsational star formation ( see also olson & kwan 1991ab ) .",
    "the episodic nature of starbursts could be a key to understanding why only a single component in many pairs shows enhanced star formation ( joseph et al .",
    "since the star formation in the members of a pair may well be unsynchronized ( bernlhr 1993a ) , there is a good chance for one of them to be in the on phase while the other is off. at the same time there is a significant probability that both components will be on ( lutz 1992 ; surace et al .",
    "this suggests that the duration of the on and off phases must be comparable ( a few 10@xmath90 yrs ) .",
    "another reason for the scatter in star formation activity could be the interaction geometry . as shown in the pioneering work of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) , retrograde and high inclination encounters cause much less distortion than direct ( prograde ) and low inclination encounters . if , as suggested , the less disturbed systems have unfavorable interaction geometries the lower star formation activity might result from this rather than from an earlier merger evolutionary stage .",
    "however the evidence that the galaxies in arp  244 ( lowest fir / b in our sample ) show prograde rotation ( van der hulst 1979 ) while ic  694 in arp  299 ( highest fir / b in our sample ) shows retrograde rotation ( hibbard & yun 1999 ) , argues against this possibility ( see also keel 1993 ; lutz 1992 ) .",
    "this is not meant to imply that orbital geometry plays no role in the star formation enhancement process .",
    "it suggests only that this role is likely to be complex .",
    "for example an unfavorable orbital geometry may preserve most of the original gas in a galaxy until a very late stage in the merger process , similar to the role played by a massive bulge in the simulation of mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ; see also evans et al .",
    "2000 ) , making a ulirg - like starburst more possible ( see , e.g. , the simulations of noguchi 1991 ) .      throughout this discussion we have adopted a scenario where galaxy pairs merge after a few close encounters , as implied by models ( e.g. barnes & hernquist 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "recent studies on the cosmic evolution of merger rate using hst data ( wu & keel 1998 ; le fvre et al .",
    "2000 ) also hint that the time scale of mergers is much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "however , pair merger time scales as short as @xmath54 gyr require an explanation for the large number of isolated binary galaxies ( @xmath91 of all galaxies , xu & sulentic 1991 ) , the majority of which must have been gravitationally bound systems for @xmath5210 gyr ( chatterjee 1987 ) .",
    "they must also account for the rarity of candidate ( early - type ) merger postcursors found in the the same environments as these large pair ( and compact group ) populations ( sulentic & rabaca 1994 ) .",
    "a possible solution for this dilemma is that today s galaxy pairs are evolved from galaxy groups . through coalescence , within the context of hierarchical galaxy formation ( white 1997 )",
    ", two giant galaxies observed now may be products of a long history of mergers / accretions of smaller galaxies which were formed as a bound system .",
    "one possibility is that some mixed pairs ( e+s ) ) represent the last stages in the coallescence of a compact group ( rampazzo & sulentic 1992 ) .",
    "such a picture may apply to the two giant galaxies in the local group ( milky way and m31 ) which may represent the early stages in the formation of a clo ss pair ( e.g. , irion 2000 ) .",
    "there is evidence that the milky way is still growing by accretion of smaller satellites , with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy being the current `` meal '' ( buser 2000 ) .",
    "given the recent discoveries closely linking galaxy evolution and interactions ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; williams et al .",
    "1998 ; thompson et al . 1999 ; elbaz et al . 1999",
    "; puget et al . 1999 ; blain et al . 1999 ) , any theory for the formation / evolution of galaxy pairs must play an integral part in the formation and evolution of galaxies in general .",
    "we present mir imaging and spectroscopic observations for a well defined sample of eight closely interacting pairs of spiral galaxies with overlapping disks and enhanced fir emission .",
    "our goal was to study the star formation distribution in these pairs with special emphasis on the importance of overlap starbursts .",
    "we identified three possible subgroups in our sample according to star formation morphology :          overlap region starbursts are detected in all of the five pairs of subgroups ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , suggesting that they are a common property of colliding systems .",
    "on the other hand , except for arp  244 , the overlap starburst is less intense than the nuclear starbursts in such pairs .",
    "star formation pairs of subgroup ( 3 ) is often more widely distributed in the disks of both components with no evidence for overlap starbursts .",
    "these systems also show a smaller fir enhancement , implying weaker star formation and suggesting that they may be in earlier interaction stages where direct disk - disk collisions have not yet occurred .",
