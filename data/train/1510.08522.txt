    "the visual and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista , @xcite ) survey of the magellanic clouds system ( vmc , @xcite ) is collecting @xmath2 photometry down to @xmath3=21.9 mag , @xmath4=22.0 mag , @xmath0=21.5 mag ( 5 @xmath5 level on the stacked images ) for sources in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , the bridge connecting them , and a small part of the magellanic stream .",
    "the vmc images are processed by the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ; @xcite ) through the vista data flow system ( vdfs ) pipeline that performs aperture photometry of the images .",
    "the reduced data are then further processed by the wide field astronomy unit ( wfau ) in edinburgh where the single epochs are stacked and catalogued in the vista science archive ( vsa ; @xcite ) . as of 2016 january ,",
    "the vmc survey observations are 74% complete , with specific completion levels of 62% , 95% , 95% and 100% for the lmc , the smc , the bridge and the stream , respectively .",
    "a main aim of the vmc survey is to study the structure of the whole magellanic system using different distance indicators . among them , most notably , are primary standard candles such as the cepheids and the rr lyrae stars , for which vmc is obtaining @xmath0-band light curves with 13 ( or more ) individual epochs , with most epochs reaching a depth of @xmath0=19.3 mag ( 5 @xmath5 level ) .",
    "the significantly reduced amplitude of these pulsating variables in the near - infrared , with respect to the optical bands , along with the multi - epoch cadence of the vmc @xmath6-band observations , allows us to infer accurate mean @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , the near - infrared period - luminosity ( @xmath7 ) relations are intrinsically much narrower than the corresponding optical relations and less affected by systematic uncertainties in reddening and metal content @xcite . for these reasons",
    "the vmc data are very well suited to construct @xmath7 relations with a high level of precision and accuracy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the smaller amplitudes compared to optical bands make it more difficult to identify these variables from near - infrared data alone . in vmc ,",
    "most of the information ( identification , period , variability type , etc . ) needed to fold the @xmath2-band light curves and derive average @xmath2 magnitudes for the variable stars are taken from the catalogues of magellanic cloud variables produced by large microlensing optical surveys such as macho @xcite , eros @xcite and ogle @xcite that were conducted in the last two decades to search for baryonic dark matter in the milky way . as described in @xcite , the observations of the fourth phase of the ogle project ( hereinafter , ogle  iv ) have been successfully run over the last five years .",
    "first results have been published in @xcite ( south ecliptic pole region ) , @xcite ( magellanic bridge ) and @xcite ( anomalous cepheids ) .. ]    [ tab : qc ] @xmath8    however , as we are writing this paper , none of the available optical catalogues cover the field of view of vmc entirely ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "there are external regions in both the lmc and smc , and the whole bridge area where a comprehensive census of all types of variable stars is still missing . on the other hand , in vmc each field",
    "is observed in the @xmath0-band at least 13 times  @xcite : 11 times with an exposure of 750s ( deep observations , hereafter ) and twice with shorter exposures of 375s each ( shallow observations , hereafter ) obtained over more than one year time - span .",
    "furthermore , the vsa provides a list of flags related to the analysis of the light curves of each vmc source @xcite , that can be used to identify variable sources . in this paper",
    "we show that , in spite of the small amplitudes in the near - infrared , pulsating variable stars can be effectively detected from the vmc data if a proper analysis is performed . specifically , we combine the information from : i ) the ( @xmath9 , @xmath0 ) colour - magnitude and the ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) colour - colour diagrams , ii ) the analysis of the @xmath0-band light curves , iii ) the period - luminosity relations , and iv ) the vsa flags , to devise a procedure and detect variable stars in the external regions of the magellanic system using only the vmc data .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "the reliability of the vsa flags in detecting variable stars is presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the method to identify variable stars in the smc where information is available from the ogle iii survey . in section 4",
    "we apply our method to identify classical cepheids ( ccs ) in external regions of the smc where the vmc observations are complete and no other cc variable star catalogue is currently available .",
    "our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "we have tested the ability of the vsa in identifying variable stars based solely on the vmc data in three most external and completely observed tiles in the lmc , namely , tile lmc 6_8 , 7_3 and 8_8 .",
    "the upper portion of table  [ tab : qc ] provides centre coordinates of these 3 lmc tiles , together with information related to their observations .",
    "we specifically selected these three tiles because they contain a large number of variable stars of different types and are located in external fields of the lmc with similar level of crowding as in the regions where we currently have vmc data , but there is no coverage by the optical surveys .",
    "we first cross - matched the ogle catalogues ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of variable stars in these fields against the vmc catalogue of the corresponding three tiles .",
    "we adopted a pairing radius of 0.5 arcsec in order to maximize the reliability of the matching procedure as discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are 7206 variable stars in common between the two catalogues ; in particular we have 94 @xmath12 scuti ( dsct ) stars , 1071 rr lyrae ( rrlyr ) stars , 1521 eclipsing binaries ( ecl ) , 217 ccs , 4289 long period variables ( among wich are 83 mira , 3626 ogle small amplitude red giants  osargs , and 580 semiregular variables  srvs ) , 6 type ii cepheids ( t2ceps ) and 8 anomalous cepheids ( acs ) .",
    "for all of them we investigated the variability classification provided by the vsa ; this is summarized by the _",
    "`` variability class '' _ parameter which is the result of the analysis performed by the wfau team on the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath0-band light curves of the sources .",
    "_ `` variability class '' _ is either 1 or 0 , whether or not the object is classified as variable ( @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ tab : var ] compares the number of ogle variable stars cross - matched with vmc sources in the aforementioned tiles and the number of them classified as variables by the vsa ( _ variableclass_=1 ) .",
    "the effectiveness of the vsa in selecting variable stars depends on the mean magnitude , period and amplitude of the light variation and , in turn , on the type of variability . indeed , according to the numbers in table  [ tab : var ] the type of variable stars most easily classified as such by the vsa are the lpv - mira , acs , lpv - srv , t2cep",
    "s and ccs . note that the sample of t2ceps and of acs are not statistically representative . in this paper",
    "we focus on the detection of cepheids , ccs in particular , because they are numerous and will give us a very good statistical sample to work with .",
    "we leave for a future paper the analysis of other types of variables .",
    "ccs typically have single - epoch photometric errors in the @xmath0-band of about 0.01 mag @xcite , typical @xmath0 amplitudes between 0.05 and 0.38 mag and periods between @xmath130.5 d and tens of days .",
    "the search for ccs was performed in regions of the magellanic system where we expect this kind of variable stars to be present and the vmc observations are complete , but for which no optical data are currently available . in particular , we focused on the external regions of the smc ( see section  [ sec : using ] ) .",

    "4 : percentage value . see text for details . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]     during the revision phase of this manuscript , @xcite paper presenting ccs in the magellanic clouds was posted as a preprint on the arxiv .",
    "the authors comment that they can counter - identify 278 sources out of the 299 cepheids in our list ( the remaining 21 fall in the inter - ccd gaps of their camera ; soszynski , private communication ) and they confirm 35 of the smc cepheids we have identified in our study . they also say that most of the remaining objects from our list turned out to be constant or nearly constant in the optical bands .",
    "we have cross - matched our catalogue with @xcite s and find that indeed 36 ( about 13% ) of our cepheids are confirmed by ogle  iv , namely , the nine ccs in common with the gcvs , the two acs also identified by @xcite and 25 new ccs .",
    "this result is encouraging , since it confirms that our method is promising despite the limited number of data points and the intrinsically low amplitude of the vmc light curves .",
    "but it is also quite puzzling due to the low rate of optical confirmations , since our 299 bona fide cepheids were selected not simply because of the light variation in the @xmath0-band , but , more importantly , because they also fall in the colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams where ogle iii smc bona - fide cepheids are found , and because they also follow the smc cepheid @xmath7 relation .",
    "the @xmath0-band light curves of our 299 bona fide smc cepheids folded according to the period derived from the analysis with _ sigspec _ , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves1 ] .",
    "we first display the 9 ccs in common with the gcvs and the 25 new ccs discovered in our study and later confirmed also by ogle  iv ; all other bona fide cepheids ( including the two acs ) follow .",
    "the light curves appear overall quite symmetrical and it is difficult with the vmc @xmath0-band data to identify features such as bumps . @xmath0 time series data for all of them are provided in table  [ tab : lightcurves ] . among the remarks in the last column of tab .",
    "[ tab : cccandidates1 ] , `` few points at min / max '' is used whenever the light curve is not homogeneously covered at minimum or maximum light . for some of these sources , we checked the light curve of nearby sources within 5 arcsec , to rule out unidentified photometric problems that might cause / mimic the light variation .",
    "they look flat suggesting that the variability of the sources identified as cepheids is real , even for less well sampled light curves .    finally , we recall that according to the results in section  [ sec : pl - selection ] our technique enables recovery of about a 66% of the true cepheids that may occur in these external regions of the smc and that bona fide cepheids may also be present in the sample of about 2,000 candidate variables fainter than @xmath0 = 17.0 mag that were not analyzed here",
    ". therefore , there are likely additional cepheids that we may have missed either because their _ sigspec _ periods are wrong by more than @xmath14 2.5 d , thus causing them to fall outside the 3@xmath5 boundaries of the @xmath7s ,  [ sec : pl - selection ] for details ) , hence they did not pass the @xmath7 selection . ] , or because they are fainter than @xmath0 = 17.0 mag .",

    "( in prep . ) studied the @xmath0-band @xmath7 relation of 1,081 smc rr lyrae stars observed by vmc .",
    "they found that these variables typically have @xmath0 mean magnitude between 17.5 mag and 19.5 mag , with a subset of about 200 of them having 17.5 @xmath15 18.2 mag . in this magnitude range",
    "there is partial overlap with the short period , faint end of the ccs distribution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cmdkjk ] ) .",
    "furthermore , while the number of ccs is expected to drop significantly moving from the centre to the external region of the smc , the distribution of rr lyrae stars declines gently and their number is expected to remain rather high in the peripheral areas we are investigating ( e.g. fig .",
    "7 of  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , some of the 1,959 candidate variables with @xmath16 18.2 mag may be rr lyrae stars .    a further three percent contamination can also be expected from ecls , they can spread all over the colour - magnitude diagram ( see @xcite ) , thus we would need different criteria to distinguish them .    finally , some of the sources could be acs like vmc - smc - cep-258 and 286 , or t2ceps , due to the partial overlap existing among the @xmath7s of the different types of cepheids , especially between ccs and acs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have developed a technique to identify variable stars using only the multi - epoch near - infrared photometry obtained by the vmc survey and have specifically tailored it to the identification of cepheids .",
    "the technique exploits colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams , and @xmath7 relations defined by known smc cepheids , along with template parameter selections and visual inspection of the light curve to identify bona fide cepheids .",
    "the technique was applied to external regions of the smc for which complete vmc @xmath0-band observations are available and no comprehensive identification of variable stars from other surveys exists yet .",
    "we have identified and present @xmath0-band light curves for 299 smc cepheids , of which 9 are ccs in common with the general catalog of variable stars ( gcvs , @xcite ) , two are acs also found by @xcite and the remaining 288 sources are new discoveries .",
    "the number of smc cepheids we have detected is consistent with the predictions of @xcite sfh recovery in these regions of the smc , taking into account that our technique may enable recovery of only about a 66% of the true cepheids that may occur in these external regions of the smc .",
    "subsequently , @xcite crossmatched 278 of the sources in our list with their optical photometry and confirmed 36 of them as cepheids .",
    "this result is encouraging , since it shows that our technique is promising despite the limited number of data points and the intrinsically low amplitude of the vmc light curves , but the low rate of optical confirmations is rather surprising and calls for further investigations to understand this discrepancy and possible physical / technical reasons behind it .",
    "this near - infrared vs optical light - curve connection / conspiracy will be addressed in a following paper .",
