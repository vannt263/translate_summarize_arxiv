    "numerous models for the dark energy have been proposed ; in one class of models , the dark energy is simply taken to be barotropic fluid , in which the pressure @xmath10 and energy density @xmath11 are related by @xmath12 one of the first cases to be investigated in detail was the equation of state @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant @xcite .",
    "for an equation of state of this form , the density of the dark energy depends on the scale factor , @xmath15 , as @xmath16    a more complex equation of state arises in the chaplygin gas model @xcite , for which the equation of state has the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant , leading to a density evolution of the form @xmath19 in this model , the density interpolates between dark - matter - like evolution at early times and dark - energy - like ( i.e. , constant density ) evolution at late times .",

    "the best fit values for the parameters in this case are : @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 together with @xmath102 . in figure 4",

    "@xmath105 ( @xmath106cdm ) is rejected at the @xmath107 confidence level , while the data favor @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "moreover , from the allowed @xmath104 space , one can see that a large portion of the allowed region corresponds to case 4 ( late phantom gcg ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous analyses that suggest that the supernova data slightly favor @xmath4 at present @xcite .",
    "there is also a small region at the @xmath107 confidence level corresponding to case 2(b ) ( early phantom gcg without an initial singularity ) .    to see how the model parameters depend on @xmath39 , we plot in fig .",
    "5 the @xmath110 confidence contours in the @xmath111 space for different values of @xmath39 .",
    "this figure shows that the allowed parameters for the gcg depend very sensitively on the assumed value for @xmath39 ; for this set of choices for @xmath39 , any of the four cases is possible . for @xmath112 ,",
    "the allowed region falls under the case 1 , where gcg behaves as a dust - like dark energy component , asymptotically approaching a cosmological constant . for @xmath113 , the data allow case 1 as well as case 3 where the acceleration of the universe is only a transient phenomena as it asymptotically approaches dust - like behavior .",
    "for @xmath114 the data allow case 2 ( both a and b ) where the gcg behaves as phantom dark energy at early times but approaches a cosmological constant at late times , as well as case 4 where the gcg evolves from cosmological - constant - type behaviour to phantom behaviour . for @xmath115 only case 4 is allowed .",
    "our results show that @xmath116 is necessary in order to have a phantom - like equation of state .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the recent results of jassal et al .",
    "@xcite , although they used a different parametrization for the dark energy equation of state .",
    "3.0 in    these results show that the value of @xmath39 is crucial in determining which types of gcg dark energy are consistent with the supernova data .",
    "the constraint on @xmath39 in @xmath106cdm models from wmap is @xmath117 @xcite , which is also consistent with recent results from sdss observations , while the more recent 2dfgrs analysis gives @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "of course , when @xmath14 is allowed to vary from @xmath119 , these limits become functions of @xmath14 , but it is clear that the current observational constraints on @xmath39 are insufficient to rule out any of our four possible gcg models using supernova data alone .",
    "in this section , we study the growth of density perturbations for the mixture of a matter fluid and a gcg dark energy fluid in the linear regime on subhorizon scales . in performing this calculation ,",
    "it is necessary to assume a particular clustering behavior for the dark energy .",
    "however , this behavior will depend on the physical model that gives rise to the chaplygin gas equation of state .",
    "for example , if the chaplygin gas is taken to be a perfect fluid satisfying equation ( [ genc1 ] ) , then the gcg component will cluster gravitationally with a sound speed given by @xmath120 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is also possible to generate minimally - coupled scalar field models with the equation of state given by equation ( [ genc1 ] ) @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "such models always have @xmath121 on subhorizon scales and therefore do not cluster on small scales .",
    "the evolution of density perturbations for a gcg dark energy component that can cluster gravitationally was examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the case of a smooth , unclustered gcg dark energy component was examined in ref .",
    "we take the latter approach here . in this case , the only effect of the gcg evolution is to alter the growth of dark matter perturbations through the effect of the gcg energy density on the expansion of the universe . however , it is important to remember that the results will be very different for the case in which the gcg component is allowed to cluster .",
    "3.0 in    assuming the gcg to be a smooth component , the growth equation for the linear matter density perturbation , @xmath122 , is given by @xmath123 where `` prime '' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath124 , `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath125 , and @xmath126 is the hubble parameter for the background expansion given in equation ( [ h ] ) . in equation ( [ delta ] ) , @xmath122 is the linear matter density contrast , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 is given by @xmath129^{1/(1+\\alpha)}}}.\\ ] ] one can easily check that for @xmath130 , the equation reduces to that for the @xmath106cdm model .",
    "we have integrated equation ( [ delta ] ) numerically from @xmath131 to @xmath132 ( taken to be the present ) .",
    "the initial conditions are choosen such that at @xmath131 , the standard solution @xmath133 for einstein - desitter universe is reached .",
    "also we have assumed the matter density parameter @xmath134 throughout .",
    "we have studied the solutions for the standard gcg ( case 1 ) , transient gcg ( case 3 ) and late phantom gcg ( case 4 ) models .",
    "6 , 7 , and 8 show the behaviour of @xmath122 as a function of the scale factor for these three cases .",
    "the standard gcg case has been studied previously by multamaki et al .",
    "@xcite , who showed that for parameters slightly deviating from the @xmath106cdm universe ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath122 deviates grossly from the standard @xmath106cdm result , making this model hard to reconcile with the present observational data .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath122 in fig .",
    "6 agrees with this result .    3.0 in    on the other hand",
    ", one can see from figs .",
    "7 and 8 ( the transient and late phantom cases respectively ) , with values of @xmath21 and @xmath37 deviating significantly from the @xmath106cdm case , that the behaviour of @xmath122 is practically indistinguishable from the @xmath106cdm case .",
    "this is an interesting result ; it shows that models with gcg dark energy can have quite different equations of state from @xmath106cdm at either early or late times , yet still give similar results for the growth of linear density perturbations .",
    "the reason for these results is clear from the behavior of @xmath11 for these models ( fig .",
    "1 ) . both the transient and late phantom gcg models , like the cosmological constant , contribute negligibly to the density of the universe at early times ; this density is dominated by the matter component . at low redshift ,",
    "the gcg in both models begins to dominate the expansion ( just as the cosmological constant does in @xmath106cdm ) , with the gcg density decreasing in time ( for the transient model ) or increasing in time ( for the late phantom model ) .",
    "however , these deviations from the behavior of the cosmological constant occur over a very short range in redshift , and by forcing @xmath135 for the dark energy to be the same in all three cases , the results for the evolution of density perturbations are almost exactly the same .",
    "3.0 in    for the standard gcg , in contrast , the dust - like behavior results in a significant contribution to the density of the universe as long as dark matter is the dominant component ; if the gcg is assumed not to cluster , the result is a significant decrease in the perturbation growth .",
    "this is illustrated more clearly in fig .",
    "9 , where we show @xmath122 as function of the scale factor for both the transient and standard gcg models with the same @xmath92 ( @xmath136 ) , along with the @xmath106cdm model .",
    "since the observations related to density perturbations are consistent with the @xmath106cdm model , our results suggest that , unlike the standard gcg model , both the transient and late phantom gcg models are consistent with the linear growth of density perturbations inferred from observations .",
    "we have not shown the results for the early phantom model , but for the case where there is no early singularity , the results are also nearly identical to the @xmath106cdm model .",
    "again , we emphasize that these results assume a non - clustering gcg . for the case",
    "where the gcg clusters as a perfect fluid , the growth of density perturbations would be quite different .",
    "our exploration of the the full @xmath137 parameter space for the generalized chaplygin gas yields three additional models beyond the standard gcg .",
    "although these can not serve as unified models for dark matter and dark energy , they can have interesting consequences when treated as models for dark energy alone .",
    "the early phantom model ( case 2 ) has the interesting property of serving as phantom dark energy ( @xmath4 ) without a late big rip singularity , and for some choices of parameters it is also free of an initial singularity . the transient cgc model ( case 3 )",
    "provides a mechanism for accelerated behavior at the present , but it asymptotically approaches dust - like behavior at late times ( i.e. , its time evolution is exactly opposite to the standard gcg model ) .",
    "thus , it provides a mechanism to allow for present - day acceleration without a future horizon .",
    "the late phantom gcg model gives @xmath4 with @xmath14 decreasing with time , and it results in a future singularity at a finite value of the scale factor .",
    "all of these models can be made consistent with the type ia supernovae observations , for an appropriate choice of @xmath39 ; the question of which models are allowed is extremely sensitive to the value of @xmath39 . if the gcg is assumed not to cluster , then all of these models ( with the exception of the subset of early phantom models with an initial singularity ) are also consistent with the growth of linear density perturbations .",
    "of course , if the gcg is assumed to cluster , then these results will be significantly altered .",
    "note that all three of our  new \" gcg models have a de sitter phase , and all three models can be tuned arbitrarily close to a cosmological constant at the present , either by pushing the phantom - like behavior arbitrarily far into the past ( early phantom model ) , or by pushing the dust - like or phantom - like behavior arbitrarily far into the future ( transient gcg and late phantom model , respectively ) .",
    "these limits may seem uninteresting , as they reduce to the @xmath106cdm model over all observable ranges , but the one exception is the transient gcg model .",
    "a dust - like phase for this model , even in the far future , eliminates the problem of future horizons .",
    "thus , the transient gcg model can be made arbitrarily similar to the @xmath106cdm model but at the same time can resolve the possible conflict between the accelerating universe and string theory .",
