    "in quantum chaotic system with finite and many dof we expect occurrence of a dissipative behavior . for example , we consider simulated light absorption by coupling a system in the ground state with radiation field . then stationary one - way energy transport from photon source to the system can be interpreted as occurrence of quantum irreversibility in the total system .",
    "such a irreversibility is called chaos - induced dissipation in quantum system with more than two dof @xcite . in this sense",
    ", we can expect occurrence of the one - way transport phenomenon in the delocalized state in the irregular motion phase if it couples with the other dof in the ground state as seen in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this appendix , we consider the reduction of the tunneling period as the perturbation strength increases in the coherent oscilation regime @xmath65 , based on a perturbed instanton tunneling . in a double - well system with dipole - type interaction , @xmath115 , the energitical barrier tunneling between the symmetric double - well",
    "can be explained by a three - state model or chaos - assisted tunneling ( cat ) @xcite .",
    "the three states that take part in the tunneling are a doublet of quasi - degenerate states with opposite parity , localized in the each well , and a third state localized in the chaotic layer around the separatrix .",
    "however , note that less attention has been paid to tunneling in kam system while chaotic dynamics has been modeled by multi - level hamiltonian and random matrix model to describe the chaos - assisted tunneling .",
    "we give an expresion of the tunneling amplitude in `` chaos - assisted instanton tunneling '' firstly proposed by kuvshinov _",
    "et al _ for a hamiltonian system with time - periodic perturbation @xcite .",
    "let us consider only monochromatically perturbed case ( @xmath12 in eq.(2 ) , @xmath116 ) because the separatrix destruction mechanism by the time - periodic perturbation has an universality although our system is different from their one . .",
    "indeed , trajectories in the neighborhood of the separatrix of the system are well reproduced by the whisker map of the system .",
    "whisker map is a map of the energy change @xmath117 and phase change @xmath118 of a trajectory in the neighborhood of the separatrix for each of its motion during one period of the perturbation , i.e. action - angle variable .",
    "moreover , if we linearize the whisker map which describes the behaviors of the trajectories in the neighborhood of the fixed point , we can obtain the following standard map , @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is a nonlinear parameter of local instability that the exact function form which is not essential for our purpose . @xmath121 increases with @xmath8 , and @xmath122 means that the dynamics of the system is locally unstable .",
    "a comparison has done between the whisker map and the strobe plots in the time continuous version by yamaguchi @xcite .",
    "the form of the mapping is convenient for the estimate of the width of the stochastic layer .",
    "the perturbation destroys separatrix of the unperturbed system and the stochastic layer appears . in the regular motion denoted by the circles in fig.3 , classical chaos can increase the rate of instanton tunneling due to appearance of the stochastic layer near separatrix of the unperturbed system . as a result",
    "the frequency of time - dependence @xmath26 increases as the classical chaos becomes remarkable in the parameter regime .",
    "note that the perturbed instanton tunneling picture disappears in the strongly perturbed regime due to the delocalization of wavepacket .    here",
    "we give only relation between the width of the stochastic layer and the tunneling amplitude in terms of path integral in imaginary time @xmath123 , found by kuvshivov _",
    "et al_. tunneling amplitude between the two wells in the perturbed system can be given by integration over energy of tunneling amplitude @xmath124 in unperturbed system as , @xmath125 \\exp\\ { -s[q(\\tau , e ) ] \\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 $ ] denotes the euclidian action .",
    "@xmath127 denotes the width of stochastic layer , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the energy of the unperturbed system on the separatrix and on the bound of stochastic layer , respectively .",
    "@xmath130 is classical solution of euclidian equation of motion .",
    "the contribution of the chaotic instanton solution are taken into account by means of integration over @xmath131 which is energy of the instanton .",
    "the perturbed instanton solutions correspond to the motions in vicinity of the separatrix inside the layer .",
    "the only manifestation of the perturbation in this approximation is the appearance of a number of additional solutions of the euclidian equation of motion with energy close to the energy of the unperturbed one - instanton solution inside the stochastic layer .",
    "accordingly , we can expect that the appearance of the stochastic layer enhances the tunneling rate as reported in the other systems @xcite .",
    "however , we have to have in mind that the result is obtained in the first order on coupling constant @xmath8 of the time - periodic perturbation and does not take into account the structure of stochastic layer .",
    "the approximation is valid if the layer is narrow by neglecting the higher order resonances in the phase space . for the more details of the perturbed instanton see ref.@xcite .",
    "the increasing of the tunneling amplitude is directly related to energy splitting @xmath63 between the quasi - degenerate ground floquet states .",
    "as seen in fig.a.1 , the increasing of number of color @xmath0 can enhance the width of the stochastic layer with the perturbation strength being kept at a constant value .",
    "the theoretical explanation for the reduction of the tunneling period with the number of color is open for further study .",
    "we expect that in the double - well system under the polychromatic perturbation this numerical study will be useful for the analytical derivation of `` reduction of tunneling period '' and `` critical strength of a transition from localized to delocalized behavior of wavepacket '' by extension of the monochromatically perturbed case .",
    "the chaos assisted instanton theory might be applicable if we will exactly estimate the width of the stochastic layer in the system under the polychromatic perturbation .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainty product is not always good measure of quantum fluctuation because it does not correspond to the real area ( or volume ) of phase space .",
    "however , we would like to pay attention to the initial growth and the mean value during the time - evolution process instead of the detail of the definition of the exact quantum fluctuation in the dynamics .",
    "practically , the @xmath132 remains small thorough the regular instanton - like motion , on the other hand , it shows sharp increase and the large value remains for the strongly chaotic cases .",
