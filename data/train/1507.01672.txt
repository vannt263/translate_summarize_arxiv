    "a recent article highlights the importance of the topology and geometry in modulating thermodynamic and electrical processes in bulk materials @xcite . our own work on how topological chirality of nanomaterials can serve as discriminator for geometrical chirality @xcite further commends this topological twist of bulk properties like ligand binding .",
    "in this paper we explore such surface dependence of assembly of micellar substances in presence of multiwall carbon nanotubes ( mwcnt ) single wall carbon nanotubes ( swnt ) and graphene .",
    "it is shown that the surface topology of the nanomaterial has an intricate but specific impact on the thermodynamics of the self assembly process of micellar substances .",
    "the packing of micelles @xcite is one parameter that is dependent on hydrophobic tail length .",
    "the equation expressing the packing parameter is given by @xcite , @xmath0 where , @xmath1 in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : packing])respectively represents the volume of the hydrophobic core , area of the cluster and chain length of the tail . in presence of super - hydrophbic nanomaterials the parameter @xmath2 is likely to change as the each of the three components of the free energy of micelle formation @xcite , @xmath3    the subscripts hp , el and if in eq . (  [ eq : gibbs ] ) representing hydrophobic packing interaction in the tail , electrical repulsion between polar heads , and interfacial energy respectively . in presence of super - hydrophobic carbon nanomaterials the interaction between the nano - surface and hydrophobic tail of the miceller object @xcite are likely to affect the first component .",
    "the polar contribution and the interfacial component may also be indirectly affected in presence of a hydrophobic surface .",
    "a vast literature has developed on dependence of critical micelle concentration ( cmc ) and gibbs free energy of micellization of ionic and nonionic surfactant systems @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic parameters ( such as enthalpy , entropy etc ) and binding behaviors of surfactant micelle have been studied using isothermal titration calorimetry ( itc)@xcite . while the existing literature highlights the role of surfactants in dispersing graphene and carbon nanotubes @xcite and in non - covalent functionalization of graphene @xcite",
    "there is a gap in literature concerning how carbon nanomaterials modulate the self assembly process of the micellar substrate . in some of the reports",
    "there has been a confusion over the entropy or enthalpy driven nature of the self assembly process . while some reports such as @xcite suggests that there will be always a positive enthalpy change , to make the micelle formation an entropy driven process , there are contradicting reports @xcite that micelle formation can have a large negative contribution to the overall free energy change . in this report",
    "we find that the sign of enthalpy change is actually a surface toplogy driven process and can change its sign from negative to positive depending on the surface topology of the nanomaterial on whose presence a self assembly process is allowed to occur .",
    "direct temperature measurement as described in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermosds ] @xmath4 fig .",
    "[ fig : thermonano ] reveal a robust thermal character for the self assembly process and their modulation by nanosurface .",
    "the micelle formation is always associated with a dip in temperature that is followed by a rise of the same .",
    "the exception happens when grapahene is present . both in figs .",
    "[ fig : thermosds ] @xmath4  [ fig : thermonano ] it is found that beyond a break point that is close to the reported cmc values ( 0.8 mm for sds and 0.78 mm for ctab ) the cooling effect is not reversed . in other words",
    "the micelles once formed and assumes a certain size are arrested , perhaps on the planar surface of graphene so that no further temperature change occurs . for other cases",
    "it seems the micelle formation is followed by formation of super - assemblies leading to further rise of temperature .",
    "the thermal measurements tallies well with the hydrodynamic diameter measured using photon correlation spectroscopy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pcssds ] ) .",
    "there is an abrupt rise in the diameter value near cmc , that reduces to smaller sizes at higher concentration .",
    "again the exception comes in presence of graphene , the self assembly process assumes a curious route , the higher concentration of the monomers showing smaller hydrodynamic value .",
    "it is possible that the high radii at lower concentration reflects a combined radii of monomers and graphene , the former forming a loose aggregated structure with the latter . as monomer concentration",
    "is increased the monomer monomer interaction becomes more prominant and a stable small miceller structure is phase separated on the graphene surface . the comparison of the swnt mwnt and graphene data in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcssds ] is also is intriguing as the hydrodynamic diameter plotted against the concentration of monomer carries signature of the surface topology of the respective nanomaterial .",
    "the broader ( and perhaps binary ) peak(s ) of the mwnt may be a reflection of its complex multilayered topology .",
    "in contrast the presence of graphene makes the hydrodynamic profile smooth , the micelle formation in thi scase being on a superhydrophobic planar surface .",
    "similar results are found in case of ctab ( data not shown ) .",
    "the fig.s  [ fig : ctabitc ] @xmath4",
    "[ fig : ctab ] summarize the isothermal titration characteristics of micellar break down process , in which a micellar solution of ctab is gradually diluted with water .",
    "sds ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : sdsitc ] @xmath4 fig .",
    "[ fig : sds ] ) also reveal similar itc profile .",
    "details of the itc measurement .",
    "the enthalpy value of the miceller substrates in absence of any nanomaterial , matches with the ones reported in @xcite      it may be noted that the enthalpic studies reveal a number of break points in each case ( ctab and sds ) , the number of break points varying depending on the nanosurface ( swnt , mntand graphene ) . if we consider the approximate relation that , @xmath5 \\label{eq : cmc}\\ ] ] where , [ cmc ] is expressed as a mole fraction of the monomers at critical micellar concentration ( one needs to use the scaling for cmc , expressed in mm using , cmc = cmc*1e-3 ; cmc(mole in mole fraction)=cmc/(cmc+55.5 ) , where 55.5 is the molarity of water ) , the values of @xmath6 is between -27.8 to -27.6 @xmath7 ( see the break points in figs .  [",
    "fig : ctab ] ) or  [ fig : sds ] ) the values of the free energy change is comparable to what is reported in @xcite .",
    "the two intriguing facts that appear is that the enthalpy values derived in @xcite are negative whereas excepting for graphene the values of enthalpy ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : sds ] and  [ fig : ctab ] ) are positive .",
    "it may be noted that since we are doing dilution of micelles into monomer the positive value in itc experiment actually implies enthalpy of break down .",
    "so essentially our results match with the enthalpy signature , implying -ve enthalpy for micelle formation .",
    "the case of graphene however implies that enthalpy change of micelle formation is actually positive . + the conservation of the free energy range varying between -27.8 to -27.6 @xmath7 for a wide class of detergents ( triton x data not shown ) suggests that while the free energy remains conserved , there is a enthalpy entropy compensation in the self assembly process nanosurfaces determining the distribution of the entropic and enthalpic component .",
    "the reversal of enthalpy changes in case of graphene ( having a positive enthalpy of formation , i.e a negative enthalpy of breakdown ) reveals that in presence of graphene the free energy component is dominated by entropic component as with constant @xmath8 implies that if @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the entropy driven nature of micelle formation is not obligatory in presence of swnt or mwntnthalpy of formation is negative .",
    "+ the hydrophobic tails of the surfactant molecules are non - covalently attached with the hydrophobic surface of swnts , mwnts and graphene .",
    "the complex forms a highly non - linear structure when the hydrophobic tails are anchored on swnts , mwnts or graphene surface . a strong repulsive interaction between the polar head groups of the adhered surfactant molecules on swnts , mwnts or graphene makes the entire structure highly non - linear .",
    "therefore the self - assembly is unstable and micelle formation is found to be affected in presence of such strong hydrophobic materials .",
    "the self - assembly is more unstable with increase concentration of surfactant in presence of carbon nanomaterials due to strong repulsive interaction between the polar head groups of the adhered surfactant molecules on swnts , mwnts or graphene .",
    "the molecular self - assembly breaks down with increase in temperature because the thermal agitation breaks the weak ( in terms of energy ) self - assembly of different surfactant monomers .",
    "the studies imply novel uses of carbon material particularly in areas where bulk thermodynamic properties may be important .",
    "the use of carbon nanotubes as fuel - borne additives in diesterol blends and their enhanced performance in combustion and emission as a result has already been pointed out @xcite . similar use of the same in fuel cells have also been pointed out @xcite .",
    "the particular use of graphene as a fuel additive @xcite in say combustion of propellants has also been reported .",
    "this paper provides a thermodynamic and hydrodynamic rationale for such usage .",
    "again , according to @xcite , the graphene oxide may facilitate electron transfer of metalloproteins and the study by@xcite show the higher proton conductivity induced by graphene , the use of the same as a bioenegetic processor ( e.g. a controllable uncoupler of oxidtative phosphorylation @xcite ) seems to be a distinct possibility .",
    "the fact that the sign of enthalpy change can be reversed by changing the nanosurface to single wall form to the graphene form is of particular interest as it shows the intricate relations the geometry and topology have with the thermodynamic behaviour of the self = assembly process ..    we wish to acknowledge the support of the author community in using revtex , offering suggestions and encouragement , testing new versions ,  .",
