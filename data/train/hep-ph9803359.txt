    "although unpolarized parton distributions in the nucleon are now known in detail from very small @xmath0 to relatively large @xmath0 , the distributions in nuclei are not investigated to such a great extent @xcite .",
    "it was usually assumed in the 1970 s that the nuclear structure functions @xmath3 were simply given by the one for the nucleon multiplied by the mass number for isoscalar nuclei : @xmath7 .",
    "nuclear binding energies are very small compared with energy scales in deep inelastic scattering , so that they were expected to be insignificant in discussing the structure functions .",
    "it is , therefore , rather startling to find significant modification of the nuclear @xmath3 at medium @xmath0 in the european muon collaboration ( emc ) data @xcite in 1983 .",
    "the nuclear modification is now named the (  old \" ) emc effect after the experimental collaboration name .    in the middle of 1980 s ,",
    "theoretical models were proposed for explaining the nuclear modification in the medium-@xmath0 region .",
    "the first idea after the emc finding is a @xmath1 rescaling model @xcite in 1983 .",
    "the original motivation for the rescaling model was to consider that the nucleon size is modified in the nuclear medium . because the structure function @xmath8 reflects lightcone momentum distributions of nuclear partons , the size change results in the modification of @xmath3 .",
    "although such modification may exist , the rescaling model is no more interpreted in the original form .",
    "it is better to be considered as an effective model @xcite , which could be consistent with the following binding model .",
    "a conservative idea in terms of nuclear binding was , on the other hand , proposed in 1985 @xcite .",
    "the nuclear @xmath3 is given by the nucleon s @xmath3 convoluted with a spectral function , which indicates momentum distributions of the nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "due to the binding energy @xmath9 , the @xmath0 distribution of @xmath3 is shifted a few percent ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "although the magnitude itself is not large , the shift becomes 10@xmath1120 % effects in the @xmath3 at medium @xmath0 . because the model is successful in explaining a significant portion of the experimental data , the binding model is now accepted as the most probable interpretation of the emc effect at medium @xmath0 .",
    "the model can also explain the large-@xmath0 region , where the ratio @xmath12 increases as @xmath13 , in terms of the nucleon fermi motion .",
    "we discuss the compatibility of the rescaling model with the binding model in section [ model ] .",
    "the small-@xmath0 region was studied particularly from the late 1980 s .",
    "accurate ratios @xmath12 were obtained experimentally at small @xmath0 for several nuclei by the new muon collaboration ( nmc ) @xcite and the fermilab - e665 collaboration @xcite .",
    "it became possible to test theoretical calculations in comparison with the data .",
    "the nuclear modification at small @xmath0 is called shadowing , which means that internal constituents are shadowed due to the existence of nuclear surface constituents . a laboratory frame picture for describing the shadowing",
    "is a vector - meson - dominance ( vmd ) type model @xcite .",
    "a virtual photon transforms into vector meson states , which then interact with a target nucleus .",
    "the propagation length of the hadronic fluctuation exceeds the average nucleon separation ( 2 fm ) in nuclei at @xmath14 , so that the shadowing occurs because of multiple scattering of the hadron inside the nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "the shadowing phenomena could be explained by a parton - recombination model @xcite , which is a description in an infinite momentum frame .",
    "the recombination occurs because the localization size of a parton with momentum fraction @xmath0 exceeds 2 fm at @xmath14 .",
    "we showed in the parton model with the rescaling and recombination mechanisms that the nuclear @xmath3 could be explained from very small @xmath0 to large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "although the nuclear @xmath3 structure functions are established , the sea - quark and gluon distributions are not well tested @xcite .",
    "of course , because the @xmath3 at small @xmath0 is essentially given by the sea - quark distribution , the sea modification should be equivalent to the @xmath3 modification in the leading order ( lo ) of @xmath15 .",
    "however , we would rather have independent confirmation , for example , by the drell - yan experiment .",
    "although there exist the fermilab - e772 drell - yan data @xcite , the small-@xmath0 shadowing part and the medium-@xmath0 region were not probed .",
    "furthermore , there is little experimental information on the nuclear gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "an item of good news is that the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) will be completed in the near future , so that the shadowing in the sea - quark and gluon distributions could be observed experimentally by the drell - yan and direct - photon processes . considering these experimental possibilities",
    ", we should try to predict the shadowing behavior theoretically in order to test our theoretical understanding on high - energy nuclear structure .",
    "the major purpose of this paper is extend the parton model in ref .",
    "@xcite to the studies of the sea - quark and gluon distributions in nuclei .",
    "in addition , the parton distributions in the nucleon are updated to the new ones .",
    "the small-@xmath0 distributions were particularly modified due to the hera @xmath3 data after the publication of ref .",
    "another purpose is to study the parton distributions in the deuteron .",
    "they were assumed to be the same as those of the nucleon in the previous publications @xcite . in section [ model ] ,",
    "our parton model is introduced with explanation for the @xmath1 rescaling and parton - recombination mechanisms . in section [ f2 ] , the @xmath3 structure functions are calculated for various nuclei in order to be compared with measured experimental data . in section [ sea - glue ] , the model is extended to the sea - quark and gluon distributions .",
    "their @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependent results are shown . as a byproduct of our investigation",
    ", we can discuss the relation between the deuteron and neutron structure functions . in section [ deuteron",
    "] , our results are compared with the experimental ratios @xmath16 .",
    "the summary is given in section [ sum ] .",
    "people studied possible physics mechanisms for interpreting the medium-@xmath0 modification of the @xmath3 structure functions just after the emc finding .",
    "a few years later , the small-@xmath0 mechanisms were investigated independently from the medium-@xmath0 physics .",
    "it is rather unfortunate that enough efforts are not made to unify these pictures to produce @xmath3 from small @xmath0 to large @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the parton distributions in the wide @xmath0 range are necessary for studying @xmath1 dependence of the structure functions because they should be supplied as input distributions . for this reason , we set up a parton model which could describe the parton distributions in the whole @xmath0 region in a dynamically consistent way @xcite .",
    "we calculated the modification of the nuclear parton distributions at certain @xmath1 ( @xmath17 ) by the rescaling and recombination mechanisms .",
    "then , they are evolved to larger @xmath1 where experimental data are taken .",
    "because the same model is used in our studies , we explain only the essential part in the following .",
    "the interested reader may look at the original papers @xcite for finding the detailed formalism .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the @xmath1 rescaling model was originally proposed as a first explicit quark signature in nuclear physics in terms of nucleon - size modification in the nuclear medium @xcite . as a result , the nuclear @xmath3 structure function is related to the nucleon s @xmath3 by a simple @xmath1 rescaling , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is called rescaling parameter .",
    "the factors @xmath20 and @xmath21 are confinement radii for the nucleus a and the nucleon , respectively .",
    "the proponents of this model modified the interpretation @xcite .",
    "they rather consider the rescaling model as an effective model , which could include the binding and/or nucleon modification effects . in order to justify this idea , they used factorization - scale independence .",
    "it means that physics observables should not depend on the scale which is introduced artificially by hand .",
    "this is generally used in structure functions , which are separated into nonperturbative quantities ( parton distributions ) and perturbative ones ( coefficient functions ) by the separation scale @xmath22 .",
    "the scale @xmath22 is introduced artificially , so that the structure functions should be independent of the scale .",
    "it leads to so called renormalization group equation .",
    "in our situation , the factorization means that a nuclear structure function is separated into a nucleon momentum distribution and the corresponding structure function in the nucleon .",
    "the factorization scale independence is not , to be exact , proved in this case .",
    "however , we consider it rather as a working hypothesis : the observables , nuclear structure functions , are independent of the artificial separation into nuclear physics and subnucleon physics",
    ". then , the nuclear binding model could be also expressed in term of the @xmath1 rescaling terminology .",
    "for example , the binding energy and fermi momentum in the fermi gas model are related to the rescaling parameter by @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the rescaling model could be considered as an effective model which could include the binding - type nuclear effects and possibly also subnucleon - type contributions . in this sense",
    ", the rescaling parameter @xmath26 could be determined by fitting some experimental data , rather than calculating it in a particular nuclear model such as the one in the rescaling paper of 1985 @xcite . in any case , the original fits are no longer valid if fermi - motion effects are included @xcite . as explained in section [ f2 ] , the parameter for the calcium nucleus @xmath27",
    "is determined by the @xmath28 data at medium @xmath0 .",
    "the other nuclear values are calculated by using the a dependence relation of the rescaling model .",
    "we use an infinite momentum picture , the parton - recombination model @xcite , for describing the small-@xmath0 shadowing physics , although there are other descriptions , for example , vmd - type models @xcite and pomeron models @xcite .",
    "these different models explain the nuclear @xmath3 structure functions in some ways or other , so the appropriate description may be determined by studying other observables such as nuclear gluon distributions or possibly the valence - quark distributions at small @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the parton recombination , which means the interaction of partons in different nucleons , is used as a model for interpreting the nuclear shadowing @xcite .",
    "this mechanism could occur by the following reason . in an infinite momentum frame ,",
    "the average longitudinal nucleon separation in a lorentz contracted nucleus is @xmath29 , and the longitudinal localization size of a parton with momentum @xmath30 is @xmath31 . at small @xmath0 ( @xmath14 ) ,",
    "the localization size becomes smaller than the average nucleon separation .",
    "it means that partons from different nucleons could interact significantly .",
    "the interaction is called parton recombination or parton fusion . according to this mechanism ,",
    "the modification of a parton distribution @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 for the recombination process @xmath34 . here",
    ", the factor @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 with the expression for the nuclear radius @xmath37 .",
    "the function @xmath38 is called parton fusion function .",
    "because the recombination is opposite to the splitting process , the @xmath39 is related to the corresponding splitting function @xmath40 in the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) @xmath1 evolution equations : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the color - factor ratio , for example @xmath43 .",
    "the averages are taken over the initial color indices , for example , @xmath44 indicates the average over the index @xmath45 .",
    "there is also a momentum - cutoff factor @xmath46 for the leak - out partons .",
    "it indicates that large - momentum partons are confined in the small region so that they do not leak out from the nucleon .",
    "it is known that @xmath47=2 fm is an appropriate value @xcite , so that it is used throughout our analysis . because the recombination formalism itself is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , we do not repeat it here .",
    "the explicit equations are given in the appendix part of ref .",
    "in order to calculate nuclear parton distributions , it is necessary to employ a set of parton distributions in the nucleon .",
    "the optimum parton distributions are obtained by fitting many experimental data from various processes .",
    "there are three major groups in the studies of the unpolarized parametrization .",
    "they are cteq ( coordinated theoretical / experimental project on qcd phenomenology and tests of the standard model ) , grv ( glck , reya , and vogt ) , and mrs ( martin , roberts , and stirling ) . among these parametrizations",
    ", we decided to take the mrs - r2 distributions @xcite without any serious reason .",
    "of course , the details of our numerical results depend on the input distributions ; however , the essential results should not be altered . for simplicity",
    ", the mrs - r2 is modified to have the flavor symmetric sea , @xmath49 , in the following analyses .",
    "we have to determine the point @xmath50 , at which the initial nuclear distributions are calculated .",
    "it is considered as a parameter in our model , and it is determined in the following way . in order to explain the large shadowing , for example in @xmath28 , it is necessary to take rather small @xmath50 because the recombination effect has a higher - twist nature ( @xmath51 ) . on the other hand , perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "is assumed in evolving the calculated distributions at @xmath52 to those at experimental @xmath1 points .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 should be in the perturbative region . with these two reasons ,",
    "we end up taking @xmath531 gev@xmath2 .",
    "because the mrs - r2 distributions are set up at @xmath1=1 gev@xmath2 , it is simply taken as the mrs - r2 point , namely @xmath50=1 gev@xmath2 , in the following analyses .    using the mrs - r2 distributions ,",
    "we calculate first the rescaling effects for the valence quark distributions at @xmath541 gev@xmath2 .",
    "because this procedure violates the momentum conservation , the gluon distribution is multiplied by a constant amount so as to satisfy the conservation .",
    "then , the obtained distributions are used as input distributions for calculating the recombination effects .",
    "the experimental @xmath1 values are different depending on the @xmath0 region : they are typically a few gev@xmath2 at small @xmath0 and a few dozen gev@xmath2 at large @xmath0 . in order to compare with the experimental data , we evolve the obtained nuclear distributions at @xmath1=1 gev@xmath2 to those at @xmath1=5 gev@xmath2 by the parton - recombination ( pr ) @xmath1 evolution equations @xcite . in particular",
    ", we use the equations proposed by mueller and qiu @xcite and their numerical solution in ref .",
    "the qcd scale parameter of the mrs - r2 is @xmath55=0.344 gev .    in calculating the rescaling ,",
    "it is necessary to find the rescaling parameter @xmath26 . as we mentioned in the previous section",
    ", @xmath27 is determined for explaining the experimental medium-@xmath0 ratios , @xmath28 , reasonably well .",
    "it is found that @xmath27=1.74 is the appropriate value at @xmath1=1 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the rescaling parameters of other nuclei are determined by the relationship of the original rescaling model .",
    "namely , the scale parameter is determined by @xmath56 with @xmath57=0.66 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the effective confinement size is given by @xmath58=1.194 according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rescale ] ) and @xmath27=1.74 .",
    "the confinement size is 5.0 percent larger than the one ( @xmath58=1.137 ) in ref .",
    "therefore , other nuclear confinement radii in ref .",
    "@xcite are also multiplied by the factor 1.050 . to be explicit ,",

    "( [ eqn : recomb ] ) and also in the pr evolution equations . however , it is well known that the deuteron radius does not follow the rule , @xmath37 with @xmath72=1.1 fm",
    ". we estimate it by the relation @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the distance between the proton and the neutron .",
    "then , the constant @xmath72 becomes @xmath72=1.56 fm for the deuteron .",
    "it is fairly large in comparison with the usual nuclear value @xmath72=1.1 fm because the deuteron is a loosely bound system .",
    "it means that the recombination effects in the deuteron are much smaller than those in other nuclei . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath72=1.56 fm for the deuteron .    with these preparations , we are ready for calculating the @xmath3 ratios @xmath12 .",

    "the dashed curve is obtained by using the nlo dglap evolution equations , and the solid one is by the pr evolution equations . the @xmath1 dependence from @xmath1=5 gev@xmath2 to larger values is rather small as we show it later .",
    "the experimental data are those of the nmc @xcite , the fermilab - e665 @xcite , and the slac - e139 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical curves are not shown at @xmath75 because the @xmath1 values of the e665 data are very small and our perturbative calculations can not be compared with them .",

    "the nmc data can be explained only if the pr evolution equations are used .",
    "it is also interesting to find that the ratio @xmath76 at large @xmath0 is explained as a recombination effect without the explicit fermi - motion corrections .",

    "next , @xmath1 dependence of @xmath28 is calculated at the fixed @xmath0 points , @xmath0=0.0085 , 0.035 , and 0.125 .",

    "namely , the calculated shadowing is too small to explain the experimental one in the region @xmath791 gev@xmath2 .",

    "the calculated distribution @xmath98 at @xmath1=5 gev@xmath2 is shown by the solid curve , which includes the nuclear corrections . because the e665 small-@xmath0 data are taken at very small @xmath1 where the perturbative qcd would not work , the theoretical curves are not plotted at small @xmath0 ( @xmath990.001 ) .    because the mrs - r2 was created so as to explain the nmc data as well as many other data , the dotted curve is in agreement with the nmc ratios .",
    "the flavor symmetric distribution , which is shown by the dashed curve , is well below the nmc data at small @xmath0 where sea - quark contributions are significant .",
    "the solid curve includes the nuclear modification due to the rescaling and recombinations , and it also contains @xmath1 evolution effects from @xmath1=1 gev@xmath2 to 5 gev@xmath2 . as a result , the solid curve is below the nmc data in the @xmath0 region ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is mainly because our model used the flavor symmetric input in order to see the nuclear modification effects .",
    "however , the difference is partly attributed to the incomplete analyses by the nmc and mrs - r2 in the sense that the nuclear corrections are completely neglected . in order to illustrate the significance of the corrections , the nuclear contribution to the gottfried sum",
    "is estimated by @xmath101 \\ .\\ ] ] the @xmath102 is the sum without the nuclear correction , and the second term ( @xmath103 ) is the correction .",
    "the integral is evaluated for the structure functions at @xmath1=5 gev@xmath2 , and we obtain @xmath104 for the integral from @xmath105 .",
    "it is the same order of magnitude as the other recent shadowing estimates @xcite .",
    "this kind of correction should be taking into account in discussing the gottfried sum rule and also other sum rules with neutron structure functions .",
    "we have investigated the parton model with the @xmath1 rescaling and parton - recombination mechanisms for describing the parton distributions in nuclei .",
    "the nuclear modification of the @xmath0 distributions is calculated at @xmath1=1 gev@xmath2 .",
    "if they are evolved to larger @xmath1 , for example @xmath1=5 gev@xmath2 , by the parton - recombination evolution equations , they become comparable with the experimental @xmath3 shadowing .    the model was then extended to the studies of sea - quark and gluon distributions in nuclei .",
    "we showed the @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependent results of the ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they indicate large nuclear shadowing at small @xmath0 and large ratios in the medium-@xmath0 region .",
    "these predictions could be tested by the experiments at rhic .",
    "the understanding of nuclear parton distributions is very important for heavy - ion physics studies , for example , in finding a signature of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we also indicated in our model that the nuclear effects should be taking into account properly in order to discuss the sum rules with neutron structure functions , which are extracted from the deuteron data .",
