    ", we introduce the category @xmath27 and its non - commutative geometry .",
    "we focus on point , line and fat point modules .",
    "we also define the algebra @xmath2 , the central focus of our paper , and briefly discuss its position as a degenerate version of the 4-dimensional sklyanin algebra and a homogenization of @xmath8 .    in  [ sec.d ] , we replace @xmath2 by @xmath145 , a zhang twist of @xmath2 which has the property that @xmath146 .",
    "in fact , @xmath145 has a central element @xmath147 such that @xmath148 is a 3-dimensional artin - schelter regular algebra , making @xmath145 a central extension of @xmath149 .",
    "this allows us to use the results in @xcite to determine the point and line modules of @xmath145 in terms of those for @xmath149 .      in ",
    "[ sec.uq ] , we relate our results about point and line modules for @xmath2 to results about the finite dimensional irreducible representations and verma modules of @xmath8 .",
    "some of these relationships are summarized in the following table :       although @xmath150 and @xmath151 are not isomorphisms , there are associated endo - functors @xmath152 and @xmath153 of @xmath24 .",

    "with this in hand , the next result describes how @xmath157 act on the four @xmath158-points obtained by degeneration from @xmath159 .",
    "the proof is a direct application of the formulas in table 2 above .",
    "if @xmath165 is the line passing through @xmath166 , we will sometimes denote the line module @xmath120 by @xmath85 for clarity .",

    "similarly , in order to keep the notation symmetric , if @xmath171 then @xmath172 is the point on @xmath63 for which @xmath169 surjects onto @xmath170 .",
    "finally , we denote by @xmath173 the diagonal action of @xmath174 on @xmath175 , and by @xmath176 the automorphism @xmath177 by a slight abuse of notation , we use the same symbols to refer to the induced automorphisms on the variety of lines through pairs of points on @xmath175 .",

    "this means that the resolutions @xmath198 of the point modules associated to @xmath199 ( e.g. from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm . 5.7 ) ) degenerate to for @xmath200 in the @xmath201 case .",

    "if @xmath229 , then we obtain surjections for _ all _ @xmath229 by applying the @xmath230-action on @xmath231 given by @xmath232 by continuity in @xmath224 , we then get such surjections for @xmath233 as well , and the previous argument applies .",
    "we end with the following remark on certain modules over @xmath234 .",

    "then , using the equivalence between the category of modules over @xmath242_0 $ ] and a full subcategory of @xmath27 , this assumption implies that the line module @xmath243 from has a non - obvious subobject in @xmath27 .",
