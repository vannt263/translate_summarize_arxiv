    "the most prominent candidate for implementing long distance quantum communication is undoubtedly represented by the electromagnetic field ( emf )  @xcite . although quantum information theory is more commonly represented in terms of discrete variables ( e.g. , qubits ) , information is most naturally encoded in the emf by means of continuous variables , which , in the quantum domain , are described by bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , all the fundamental quantum information tools and protocols have been demonstrated for continuous variable systems  @xcite , from quantum computation  @xcite to quantum error correction  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite and quantum key distribution  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the problem of optical quantum communication  @xcite , and compute the communication capacity , i.e. , the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted .",
    "although we explicitly consider communication of classical information  @xcite , our results are immediately extensible to the case of quantum information  @xcite .",
    "the most general and simple , although physically relevant , mathematical model of optical communication line is the gaussian channel  @xcite , which describes the linear propagation of the emf . in the classical domain ,",
    "the ultimate limits for communication via gaussian channels were provided by the seminal work of claude e.  shannon  @xcite . in the quantum domain ,",
    "the structure of gaussian channels is notably rich  @xcite , with non - trivial properties in terms of degradability  @xcite and security  @xcite .",
    "however , a full information theoretical characterization has been presently achieved only for certain families of channels , such as the lossy channel  @xcite .",
    "these results have been applied to compute the maximum rate of reliable communication via attenuating media , as optical fibers , wave - guides , and via free - space propagation  @xcite . moving along this line",
    "we shall provide the information theoretical description of the effects of the signal propagation through lossy communication channels with linear characteristic . after introducing the general methods , we consider the example of an optical refocusing system with finite pupil , which is schematized as a thin lens which is placed between the sender of the message and the receiver under focusing conditions . notwithstanding its relatively simple structure",
    "this setup captures the basics features of all those situations in which a transmitted signal is either focused on a detector by a suitable optical system prior to the information decoding process , or where it has to be refocused by a suitable repeater to allow long distance communication , e.g. , by means of parabolic antenna for satellite communication  @xcite .",
    "we explictly discuss how the signal diffraction through the optical system can be formally described as a quantum channel with correlated noise ( _ memory channel _ )",
    "@xcite , where correlations are quantified in terms of the associated rayleigh length . therefore the information theoretical characterization of the resulting quantum channel is carried out using tools and methods that have been previously applied to quantum memory channels  @xcite . in this framework",
    "the main effect of the signal propagation through the optical system is to introduce the diffraction of light caused by its finite pupil , leading to bandwidth limited communication  @xcite .",
    "however , when compared with the free - space communication scheme  @xcite , the presence of the refocusing apparatus may yield an improvement in the channel capacity of the system . this possibility has been put forward in  @xcite . here",
    "we provide a detailed derivation of the channel model together with the analysis of results in several configurations .",
    "furthermore , we also extend the approach to encompass the case of non - monochromatic light .",

    "[ thechannel ] we quantize this system , whose communication capacity is computed in sec .",

    ", the transmitter and receiver could be antennae . for optical communication",
    ", the transmitter could be a laser coupled to a telescope , and the receiver could be a telescope coupled to a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) array . transmitter and receiver modes typically have both spatial characteristics determined by the optical properties of the setup , and temporal characteristics , determined by the frequency and bandwidth of the radiation employed in the communication .",
    "the transmittivity matrix @xmath4 gives the fraction of light from the @xmath1-th transmitter mode that is received at the @xmath3-th receiver mode .",
    "we would like to determine the maximum amount of information that can be sent for fixed total input power .",
    "first , consider the purely lossy case , in which noise from the environment is neglible .",
    "this is the case , for example , for free - space optical communication in a thermal background .",
    "the addition of noise will be considered below .",
    "when there is just one transmitter mode and one receiver mode , the channel is simply the lossy bosonic channel , whose classical capacity is known  @xcite : if the loss is @xmath5 and the single - use average photon number is @xmath6 , then the number of _ bits _ that can be sent down the channel is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 the capacity is attained by sending coherent states down the channel . if there are @xmath0 parallel channels , with average photon number @xmath9 for the @xmath1-th channel , then the capacity is simply the sum of the capacities for the individual channels .    in our case",
    ", we have a single multimode lossy channel with transmittivity matrix @xmath4 , which mixes the input modes together .",
    "this channel can be transformed into a set of parallel channels by using the singular value decomposition .",

    "the singular value decomposition shows that any multimode lossy channel can be decomposed into parallel lossy channels with input modes corresponding to the rows of @xmath16 , output modes corresponding to the columns of @xmath13 , and loss factors corresponding to the singular values @xmath20 .",

    "the communication capacity of the channel when @xmath28 photons are transmitted down the @xmath1-th singular value mode is simply @xmath29 .",
    "if the @xmath3-th singular value mode has average energy per photon @xmath30 , then the capacity of the channel with total energy @xmath31 per use is obtained by solving the constrained maximization problem with lagrangian @xmath32 yielding the solution @xmath33^{-1}\\ ] ] here , the lagrange multiplier @xmath34 is chosen to give the proper total energy @xmath31 . in the following , when dealing with monochromatic light , we express the energy in terms of number of photons , @xmath35 .    thus , the singular value decomposition allows us to transform any linear , lossy , multimode channel with transmittivity matrix @xmath4 into a set of parallel lossy channels .",
    "quantization then yields the capacity of this set of parallel channels .",
    "we now apply this result to various simple optical settings .",
    "in particular , we show that the resulting capacity can be significantly larger than the capacity which is achieved by using ` naive ' coding and decoding techniques .",
    "we consider the propagation of light along an optical axis  @xmath36 .",

    ".      we shall see that the effects of diffraction on light propagation can be described as memory effects in the communication channel .",
    "let us recall that a _ memoryless _ channel is such that its action on different channel inputs are identical and independent .",
    "conversely , the actions of a _ memory channel _ , also called a _ channel with correlated noise _ , at different uses are not independent and/or not identical .",

    "in fact , a pair of output fields , corresponding to the the @xmath61-th and @xmath63-th inputs have a non vanishing spatial overlap @xmath64 that is , @xmath65 the overlap between output signals may cause interference , which in turn produces distortion and loss of information in the communication via the optical channel . in particular , the overlap with the output field generated by the @xmath61-th input signal induces noise in the detection of the @xmath63-th output . if the overlap between the two output fields is not negligible ",

    "it follows that correlated noise may affect all the quantum information protocols requiring propagation and detection of quantum light .",
    "finally , this formal equivalence has allowed us to apply tools that were developed in the framework of quantum memory channel characterization to the diffraction problem .",
    "in particular , this has allowed us to show that , under certain conditions , a converging optical apparatus can be used to achieve higher transmission rates than the free - space field propagation .",
