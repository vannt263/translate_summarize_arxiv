    "in the framework of the so - called turbulent @xmath0 effect , rotation has always been considered the pivot point in the generation of `` cyclonic turbulence '' . recently , by means of shearing box simulations with peculiarly elongated aspect ratios , @xcite have claimed that a turbulent dynamo can already be excited in the presence of shear alone , i.e. , in the absence of rotation .",
    "this finding notably disagrees with quasi - linear theory @xcite  at least for order of unity magnetic prandtl numbers .    with this controversy in mind , we want to turn to the question whether the galactic dynamo indeed depends on rotation as a source of helicity . @xcite",
    "derive a non - vanishing shear @xmath0 effect for the case where there exist gradients in the turbulence .",
    "this is certainly the case for the stratified galactic disk .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] we see that the irregular field is indeed amplified by the combined action of turbulence and shear .",
    "this means that already the small - scale dynamo benefits from the local field - line stretching induced by the shear gradient .",
    "the growth , however , happens at a much lower rate compared to the case of differential rotation .",
    "moreover , under the effect of the coriolis force , the mean field grows at a similar rate compared to the irregular component . in the contrary ,",
    "we observe a decaying mean magnetic field in the case of shear alone .",
    "as we will see from a detailed analysis of the inferred dynamo coefficients , this is not because there is no @xmath0  effect but because the shear - induced effect has the wrong sign  for which the turbulent pumping is too weak to support the dynamo against the strong galactic wind .",
    "note that the only difference between the models lies in the coriolis force ; because curvature terms are neglected in the shearing box approximation , both runs assume the same linear profile of the background velocity .",
    "our simulations are based on first principles and their outcome has to be regarded as rather fundamental . since , however , the current setup only represents a narrow region in parameter space , our findings have to be backed up by the underlying theory .",
    "consequently , by means of the so - called test - field method @xcite , we derive closure parameters in the framework of mean - field mhd  for details see @xcite , and references therein .",

    "the diagonal elements ( left panel ) clearly show a negative ( positive ) sign in the top ( bottom ) half of the simulation box . while this is opposite to the case of differential rotation , the vertical transport via",
    "the mean flow @xmath3 and the off - diagonal elements ( right panel ) are comparable in both cases .    based on the inferred @xmath0 and @xmath4 coefficients",
    ", we study the dependence on the net vertical transport with the help of a 1d dynamo model .",
    "because the shear gradient defines a distinct sense of orientation , the overall sign in the @xmath0  effect is indeed significant .",
    "it is well known from solar dynamo models that the sign of @xmath5 determines the direction of the travelling dynamo wave . in the absence of net vertical transport , this is reflected in dynamo patterns travelling towards the midplane for differential rotation , and away from it for shear alone . as we will see",
    "shortly , the different behaviour affects the overall growth rate when the effects of the diamagnetism and mean flow are included .     for different peak values @xmath3 of the galactic wind .",
    "negative @xmath6 correspond to decaying solutions . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we plot growth rates of dynamo solutions obtained by varying the amount of the diamagnetic transport @xmath7 and the amplitude of the mean flow @xmath3 while keeping the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 fixed . for differential rotation",
    ", the fastest growing solutions are obtained at an outward residual velocity ) , the definition of a `` residual '' is not quite straightforward . as a rule of thumb , one can double the value for @xmath11 . ] of @xmath12 , which agrees well with the findings of and . for stronger inward pumping ,",
    "the field is more and more squeezed into the midplane and the effective turbulent dissipation is enhanced .",
    "if , on the other hand , we reduce the amount of pumping , the wind can efficiently remove the created field and the dynamo mechanism is quenched as well .",
    "independent of @xmath3 , we find a limit of @xmath13 for the residual velocity , which implies that a weak inward pumping will already lead to growing dynamo solutions .    in the case of cartesian shear , the situation is drastically changed .",
    "because of the opposite sign of the @xmath0  effect , the dependence on the diamagnetic pumping is found to be much more critical . because the basic solution already constitutes outward travelling dynamo waves , a much stronger inward pumping",
    "is needed to balance the galactic wind . in accordance with the results from our direct simulations",
    ", we consequently do not observe growing dynamo modes ( cf .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) at a realistic level of turbulent pumping .",
    "by means of combined direct numerical simulations and 1d dynamo models , we have demonstrated that the @xmath0  effect arising from the combined action of stratification and cartesian shear does not lead to a growing mean magnetic field in the context of the galactic disk .",
    "while the one - dimensional model closely resembles the elongated simulation box , it has to be checked carefully to what extent this approach puts constraints on the admissible dynamo solutions .",
    "this means that global mean - field models are required to further support the current results . with respect to the direct simulations",
    ", there remains the possibility that the relevant effects also depend on the magnetic prandtl number @xmath14 , which needs to be checked via quasi - linear theory ."
