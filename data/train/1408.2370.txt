    "in the last two decades , extensive theoretical and experimental works have focused on the study of liquid helium at negative pressures and ultra - low temperatures .",
    "@xcite the equation of state of this material has been measured very accurately within the density range in which is stable , and extrapolated to the region of negative pressures .",
    "@xcite on the theoretical side , quantum monte carlo methods have allowed for precise and explicit simulation of metastable liquid helium , producing results which are in remarkable good agreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite a quantity of central interest in all these studies is the spinodal pressure @xmath3 , that is , the pressure at which the bulk modulus , @xmath5 , and sound velocity vanish and thus the liquid becomes unstable against long wavelength density fluctuations . in liquid",
    "@xmath0he @xmath3 amounts to @xmath2  bar , while in liquid @xmath6he to @xmath7  bar .",
    "@xcite    analogous studies performed in solid helium are almost non - existent in the literature .",
    "@xcite at @xmath8  k solid helium becomes stable at pressures larger than @xmath9  bar , thus certainly the realm of negative pressures lies well below such a threshold .",
    "nevertheless , analysis of the mechanical instability limit in helium crystals turns out to be a topic of fundamental interest .",
    "in contrast to liquids , solids can sustain shear stresses and because of this ordinary fact the definition of the spinodal density in crystals differs greatly from the one given above . in the particular case of solid @xmath0he ,",
    "previous attempts to determine @xmath3 have been , to the best of our knowledge , only tentative .",
    "@xcite    the energy of a crystal under a homogeneous elastic deformation is @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the elastic constants and @xmath12 a general strain deformation ( both expressed in voigt notation ) . the specific symmetry of a crystal determines the number of independent elastic constants which are different from zero . in the case of hexagonal crystals ( e.g. , hcp @xmath0he )",
    "these are five : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the conditions for mechanical stability in a crystal follow from the requirement that upon a general strain deformation the change in the total energy must be positive .",
    "it can be shown that in hcp crystals subjected to an external pressure @xmath18 , these conditions readily are  @xcite @xmath19~ \\nonumber \\\\ c_{11 } - c_{12 } - 2p & > & 0~[{\\rm c2}]~ \\nonumber \\\\ \\left ( c_{33 } - p \\right ) \\left ( c_{11 } + c_{12 } \\right ) - 2 \\left ( c_{13 } + p \\right)^{2 } & > & 0~[{\\rm c3}]~.   \\label{eq : conditions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spinodal pressure , or limit of mechanical stability , in a crystal then is identified with the point at which any of the three conditions above is not fulfilled .",
    "we must note that the bulk modulus of an hexagonal crystal can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath20 thus the conditions at which the bulk modulus ( and sound velocities ) vanishes in general must not coincide with the corresponding limit of mechanical stability .",
    "this reasoning is in fact very different from the usual @xmath3 analysis performed in liquids .    in this article",
    "we present a computational study of the energetic and elastic properties in solid @xmath0he at pressures below @xmath9  bar , based on the diffusion monte carlo method .",
    "our first - principles calculations allow us to determine with precision the limit of mechanical stability in this crystal , which we estimate to be @xmath1  bar ( that is , much larger in absolute value than the one found in the fluid ) .",
    "moreover , we show that , in contrast to liquid helium , the pressure variation of the sound velocities near @xmath21 do not follow a power law of the form @xmath4 with @xmath22.@xcite    the organization of this article is as follows . in the next section , we provide the details of our computational method and calculations . in sec .",

    "sound velocities in solids can be either longitudinal or tranverse and depend on the direction of propagation . in crystals with hexagonal symmetry two main propagation modes",

    "these results differ greatly from the usual conclusions drawn on the mechanical stability in liquids .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the variation of the sound velocities near the spinodal density in solid @xmath0he could follow a power law of the form @xmath75 where @xmath22 , in analogy to what is observed in the liquid .",
