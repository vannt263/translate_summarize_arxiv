    "ultracold gases of bosonic and fermionic atoms have shown numerous fascinating effects . in some relatively recent experiments , it has become possible to create bose - einstein condensates of dipolar atoms @xcite , and also to confine ultracold polar molecules @xcite .",
    "dipolar gases may give rise to novel physics as compared to non - dipolar ones : unlike the usual hard - core potential , which describes the effective atom - atom interaction of non - dipolar atoms , the dipole - dipole interaction is anisotropic , nonlocal and it may be partly attractive and partly repulsive .",
    "for example , even when all the dipoles are aligned ( under , e.g. , the action of an electric or magnetic field , as we consider in the present study ) , the sign and the strength of the interaction may vary spatially , and can be tuned externally by changing the orientation of the applied field @xcite .    in some other recent experiments , toroidal trapping potentials",
    "have been realized experimentally @xcite , where bose - einstein condensates of non - dipolar atoms were observed to support persistent currents @xcite .",
    "the realization of a dipolar bose - einstein condensate trapped in toroidal / annular potentials should therefore be feasible experimentally , as well .",
    "a condensate in such a topologically non - trivial confining potential is an ideal system for the investigation of various interesting phenomena , including superfluid properties , nonlinear effects , etc .",
    "theoretical studies of dipolar atoms trapped in toroidal potentials have been performed recently @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "et al._considered a three - dimensional trapping geometry and used the gross - pitaevskii mean - field approximation to investigate the ground - state and the rotational properties of a dipolar condensate for a fixed orientation of the dipoles , which was chosen to be on the plane of motion of the atoms ( say , the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane ) .",
    "it was shown that if the dipoles are pointing along , e.g. , the @xmath0 axis , there is a high concentration of them around the two points with coordinates @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the mean radius of the torus , since around these two points the dipoles are predominantly oriented head - to - tail and therefore the interaction is mostly attractive . as we see below ,",
    "the dipolar energy has two degenerate minima at these two points . as a result , as the strength of the dipolar interaction increases  with all the other parameters kept fixed ",
    "the density shows first two peaks around them .",
    "eventually this two - fold symmetry is broken and the cloud concentrates around only one of them .",
    "if the dipolar interaction becomes strong enough , the gas collapses . in the same study",
    "it was also found that the gas supports metastable currents . in a more recent paper @xcite",
    "the same authors demonstrated that this system exhibits josephson oscillations and macroscopic quantum self - trapping .",
    "finally , in ref.@xcite , zllner _",
    "considered quasi - one - dimensional motion of aligned dipolar atoms along a toroidal trap , assuming a very tight confinement in the transverse direction , and studied the few - body regime with the method of numerical diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian .    in the present study",
    "we consider a dipolar bose - einstein condensate confined in a ( quasi - two - dimensional ) annular trap , and assume that all the dipoles are aligned along some direction , forming an angle @xmath4 with their plane of motion .",
    "in addition to the dipolar interaction , we consider a zero - range contact potential with strength @xmath5 .",
    "using the mean - field , gross - pitaevskii approximation we determine the absolute and/or local minima of the energy of the system for several values of @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "we identify a collapsed phase , in which the system can not support itself , and a stable one . within the stable phase we also find a subphase in which the gas supports metastable , persistent currents .",
    "our results show that the boundaries between the different phases have a sinusoidal dependence on the angle @xmath4 , in agreement with a simple variational model that we present .",
    "the atomic density distribution that we find resembles that of the study by abad _",
    "_ when the dipole moment is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the atoms the density is axially symmetric",
    ". as the angle is tilted , the density develops two maxima , and eventually the cloud concentrates around only one of these two maxima .",
    "we also find that , as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath6 , even when the particle density is not circularly symmetric , the system may support persistent currents , provided that the atoms are not concentrated around a single density maximum .",
    "this behaviour is in a sense reminiscent of the case of purely contact interactions , where , if the ground - state density localizes , the system undergoes solid - body rotation and there is no metastability .    in what follows",
    "we first present our model in sec.ii . in sec.iii",
    "we investigate the stability of the system against collapse , and in sec.iv the stability of persistent currents .",
    "finally , in sec.v we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a dipolar bose - einstein condensate at zero temperature , confined in an axially - symmetric potential @xmath7 where the @xmath8 direction is chosen to be the symmetry axis of the potential , and @xmath9 is the position vector on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "also , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the frequencies of the confinement along the @xmath8 axis and along the direction perpendicular to it .",
    "we choose @xmath12 equal to 100 , in order for @xmath13 to be much larger than all the other energy scales in the problem , in which case the motion is quasi - two - dimensional .",
    "finally , we consider @xmath14 , where @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] is the oscillator length corresponding to @xmath11 , and @xmath16 is the atomic mass . under these conditions @xmath17 describes an annular potential with mean radius @xmath3 and width @xmath18 , as shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "axis , while on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane the atoms are assumed to move in an annulus of mean radius @xmath3 and width @xmath19 .",
    "the dipoles are oriented on the @xmath0-@xmath8 plane forming an angle @xmath4 with the @xmath0 axis due to the action of an external ( magnetic or electric ) field @xmath20.,width=226 ]    turning to the interactions , we consider both the usual contact potential and the dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the matrix element for zero - energy elastic atom - atom collisions . when the atoms have an electric dipole moment @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the permittivity of the vacuum , while when the atoms have a magnetic moment @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the permeability of the vacuum .",
    "finally , @xmath29 is the angle between the dipole moment and the relative position vector @xmath30 of two dipoles .",
    "the assumption of strong confinement along the @xmath8 axis implies that the motion of the atoms is frozen along this direction .",
    "this allows us to make an ansatz for the order parameter of the form @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the ground state of the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath10 , and @xmath33^{1/2}$ ] . with this ansatz",
    ", one may integrate the dipole - dipole interaction along the @xmath8 direction and derive an effectively two - dimensional dipolar potential .",
    "after performing the integration , this potential takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath34 \\nonumber\\\\   + 2\\cos^{2}\\theta\\cos^{2}\\phi\\biggl[- 2 \\tilde r_{\\perp}^2    k_{0}(\\tilde r_{\\perp}^2)+(2 \\tilde r_{\\perp}^2 - 1 )   k_{1}(\\tilde r_{\\perp}^2 ) \\biggl]\\biggl\\ } , \\label{eqvdipeff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the angle in cylindrical polar coordinates , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the zeroth - order and first - order modified bessel functions of the second kind .    integrating also the contact interaction over the @xmath8 direction we find that the total effective interaction is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 satisfies the gross - pitaevskii - like equation @xmath42    \\phi({\\bf r}_{\\bot } ) =   \\nonumber \\\\ = \\mu \\phi({\\bf",
    "r}_{\\bot } ) , \\label{gpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the chemical potential , and @xmath43 is the effective dipolar interaction potential . in order to solve eq.([gpe ] ) , we have employed a fourth - order split - step fourier method within an imaginary - time propagation approach @xcite .",
    "the method requires the selection of an initial state , which is then propagated in imaginary time until a ( local or absolute ) minimum of the energy is reached and numerical convergence is achieved . in what follows",
    "we fix the value of the dipolar length @xmath44 , to the value of @xmath45 , and vary @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we first investigate the ground state of the system . since the dipolar interaction may be partly attractive , and we also allow for negative values of the contact interaction , we start with the stability of the ground state against collapse . for this purpose ,",
    "we choose the initial guess for @xmath41 to be proportional to @xmath46 $ ] , i.e. , an axially symmetric gaussian , which is peaked around @xmath47 , with a width determined by @xmath48 . for a given @xmath4",
    ", we solve eq.([gpe ] ) for different values of @xmath5 , identifying the different phases , and then we plot the corresponding phase diagram @xmath49 , which is shown in fig .",
    "the boundary separating the collapsed from the stable phase can be fitted rather well by the following sinusoidal function @xmath50 with @xmath51 , which is represented by the dashed curve in fig.2 . as expected",
    ", the minimum value of @xmath5 necessary to prevent the collapse decreases as the orientation angle of the dipoles @xmath4 increases , since in this case the dipole - dipole interaction becomes increasingly repulsive .     in the horizontal axis and the strength of the contact potential @xmath5 in the vertical one .",
    "the three phases discussed in the text are presented : the stable phase where there exist metastable states ( green circles ) , the stable phase that does not support persistent currents ( blue squares ) , and the collapsed phase ( red triangles ) .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines represent the fitting functions of eqs.([gstab ] ) and ( [ gmet ] ) , respectively.,width=340 ]    in order to get a better understanding of the above results , it is instructive to consider a variational order parameter of the form @xmath52 , where all the three functions are assumed to be gaussian with widths determined by the oscillator length @xmath53 , and the variational parameters @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( as discussed in detail in the appendix ) . here",
    "@xmath56 is the coordinate that corresponds to the transverse direction and is measured from the minimum of the annular potential .",
    "also , @xmath57 is the coordinate that corresponds to the longitudinal direction and is measured from one of the two minima of the dipolar interaction . as shown in the appendix , we first integrate the dipole - dipole interaction entering eq.([intef ] ) along the vertical and transverse directions , assuming @xmath58 .",
    "then , if we consider two dipoles located at the positions @xmath57 and @xmath59 along the annulus , for small values of @xmath60 , we obtain an effectively one - dimensional dipolar potential , which is given by @xmath61 .",
    "\\label{vdip1d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one can see , @xmath62 separates in the relative coordinate @xmath63 and the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath64 , as in the case of quasi - one - dimensional motion in a toroidal trapping potential @xcite ; see also refs.@xcite . in eq.([vdip1d ] ) , the term that depends on the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath65 is @xmath66 , and has two degenerate local minima , at the points with coordinates @xmath67 , if @xmath68 , as expected from the arguments presented earlier .    integrating also in the longitudinal direction , under the assumption of a gaussian profile , we find that the energy of the gas is @xmath69 in evaluating the last term we have introduced a cut - off length in the integration over @xmath70 set by the oscillator length @xmath53 in the @xmath8 direction . also , the factor 3/2 in the same term comes from averaging the function @xmath71 [ that enters @xmath72 along the longitudinal direction .",
    "this factor is accurate when @xmath55 is comparable to @xmath3 , or in other words when the density in the longitudinal direction is either homogeneous , or close to homogeneous , as compared to the spatial variation of @xmath73 , which is of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "four important conclusions follow from eq.([trial ] ) :    \\(i ) first of all , this problem resembles that of a non - dipolar system in two dimensions interacting via an effective contact potential with strength @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "\\(ii ) if the motion in the transverse direction is frozen , the variational length @xmath54 may be set equal to the oscillator length @xmath48 , and @xmath55 is the only free parameter .",
    "the motion is then quasi - one - dimensional and , for small values of @xmath55 , the kinetic energy , which scales as @xmath76 , dominates over the interaction energy , which scales as @xmath77 .",
    "thus , in this case the total energy is always bounded and there is no collapse . on the other hand ,",
    "if the motion in the transverse direction is not frozen ( i.e. , as the annulus becomes wider ) , the system is not necessarily stable against collapse : in this case , the interaction energy scales as @xmath78 , and the kinetic energy scales as @xmath76 and @xmath79 along the longitudinal and the transverse directions , respectively .",
    "therefore , the energy is not necessarily bounded and the system may collapse , under the conditions that we investigate below .",
    "\\(iii ) provided that the system is stable , the energy has a local minimum that determines the width of the cloud in the transverse and longitudinal directions .",
    "\\(iv ) finally , from eq.([trial ] ) one may also deduce the functional form of the minimum value of @xmath80 that is necessary for the stability of the gas against collapse . since @xmath53 is chosen to be small , the last two terms in eq.([trial ] ) are the dominant ones . as a result",
    ", the critical value of @xmath5 is given by the approximate expression @xmath81 , \\label{pb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is in rather good agreement with eq.([gstab ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the second main question of the present study , which is the stability of persistent currents . to answer this question we choose the initial state to be proportional to @xmath82 $ ] , which has the same density distribution as before , but now with @xmath83 units of circulation . for a given value of @xmath5 and @xmath4 ( in the part of the phase diagram where the ground state is stable )",
    ", the final state may or may not preserve the circulation , indicating the support or not of persistent currents for the particular choice of parameters .",
    "these two situations are represented in fig.2 , with green circles and blue squares , respectively , for one unit of circulation , @xmath84 .",
    "the boundary between these two phases is given approximately by @xmath85 and is represented in fig.2 by the dotted curve . in analogy to the case of non - dipolar atoms",
    "@xcite , we have observed metastable states with up to four units of circulation , @xmath86 with the minimum value of @xmath5 necessary for the stability of the currents increasing with @xmath83 .",
    "again , one can get some insight into this result from the variational model presented in the previous section . for a bose - einstein condensate with purely contact interactions that is confined in a ring potential",
    ", the critical value of @xmath22 for the existence of persistent currents with one unit of circulation satisfies the equation @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the density of the gas ( homogeneously distributed ) @xcite . using this result for the effective coupling constant @xmath90",
    ", one gets @xmath91 - 3 \\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\ , \\frac { \\hbar^2 } { m r^2 } \\frac { r a_z a_{\\perp } } { n d^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above formula differs from eq.([pb ] ) in the last term .",
    "however , this term is small , and therefore the variational model implies that @xmath92 varies sinusoidally with @xmath4 , and also that the two phase boundaries are close to each other , in agreement with the numerical results .     of the phase diagram of fig.2 .",
    "the phase of the order parameter for each configuration is also shown in the insets , with the associated colorbar represented on the left of the figure . panels ( a ) and ( d ) correspond to metastable states with one unit of circulation , ( b ) and ( c ) to metastable states with two units of circulation , and ( e ) , ( f ) correspond to current - free states . the dashed line in ( f )",
    "is drawn to guide the eye along the minimum of the annular potential.,width=340 ]    in fig.3 we show the two - dimensional density distribution and the phase of the order parameter corresponding to different values of @xmath4 and @xmath93 within the blue and the green regions of the phase diagram of fig.2 .",
    "when the dipole moment is oriented perpendicularly to the plane of motion of the atoms , the dipolar interaction is isotropic and purely repulsive , resembling the contact potential , and as a result the density is axially symmetric .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the density for @xmath94 and @xmath95 and @xmath96 , corresponding to metastable states with one and two units of circulation , respectively .",
    "since the density is axially symmetric , the expectation value of the angular momentum per particle for these current - carrying states is @xmath97 and 2 , respectively .",
    "panels ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) show the density for @xmath98 and @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively , corresponding to states with @xmath101 , and 0 . in this case , the dipolar interaction is anisotropic and as a result the cloud concentrates around two opposite ends of the annulus , as discussed earlier @xcite .",
    "notice that the states shown in ( c ) and ( d ) support persistent currents , even though the density is not axially symmetric . as a result",
    ", @xmath102 does not have an integer value and it is equal to @xmath103 , 0.56 in panels ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "finally , in panel ( f ) we show the density for @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in this case",
    "there is a spontaneous symmetry - breaking due to the dipolar interaction and the density localizes in one of the two degenerate minima of the dipolar potential , in close analogy to the case of toroidal trapping @xcite .",
    "the system then rotates as a solid body and persistent currents are not stable . indeed ,",
    "our results indicate that the presence of only one density maximum excludes the possibility of metastability .",
    "in this study we have considered a dipolar bose - einstein condensate that is confined in an annular potential .",
    "the atoms are assumed to interact via the dipolar interaction , plus an extra short - ranged potential .",
    "the dipoles are assumed to be aligned along a direction that forms an angle @xmath4 with their plane of motion .",
    "our two basic results are the stability of the ground state against collapse and the stability of persistent currents as a function of the angle @xmath4 and of the strength of the hard - core potential @xmath5 .",
    "the hard - core and the dipolar interactions combine , giving rise to an effective interaction that is spatially dependent .",
    "furthermore , this effective interaction depends on the angle of orientation of the dipoles , which can be tuned externally by simply tilting the applied polarizing field .",
    "it is well known that the strength of the contact potential may be tuned via the so - called feshbach resonances @xcite . in our suggested physical system",
    "the tunability becomes possible via the change of the orientation of the external polarizing field .",
    "in addition , in the case of feshbach resonances one may only change the value of the scattering length , while here the effective coupling is spatially dependent .    in the phase diagram @xmath5 versus @xmath4 we determined two boundaries , one delimitating the region where the system is stable against collapse , and another one delimitating the region where persistent currents are stable .",
    "both phase boundaries have a sinusoidal dependence on the angle @xmath4 , in agreement with a simple variational model that we have presented . as the strength of the dipolar interaction decreases ,",
    "the variation of @xmath80 decreases and in the limit that it vanishes , the two phase boundaries which we have found become horizontal straight lines , corresponding to the limit of purely contact interactions .",
    "we have seen that metastability of the flow is possible even for values of the angle @xmath4 that give rise to inhomogeneous density distributions , provided that the gas preserves the two - fold symmetry of the dipolar interaction and is not concentrated around only one of the minima of the dipolar potential . according to our results ,",
    "provided that the density is not homogeneous , the presence of two density maxima is a necessary , but not a sufficient condition for metastability .",
    "this situation is somewhat analogous to the case of a bose - einstein condensate which is trapped in a ring potential and interacts via purely contact interactions : in this case , if the strength of the contact potential is sufficiently large in magnitude and negative , there is a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the axial symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the ground - state density localizes and it is energetically favorable for the system to carry angular momentum via solid - body rotation , in which case the system does not support persistent currents .",
    "an appealing property of this system is that one may sweep through all the three phases by simply changing the orientation angle of the dipoles , even when all the other parameters are kept fixed .",
    "an interesting potential application of this fact might be a  mesoscopic superfluid ring \" ,",
    "i.e. , a device that is either  normal \" or  superfluid \" , depending on the orientation of the external polarizing field .",
    "therefore , this problem is interesting not only for purely theoretical reasons , but also in connection with applications on e.g. , precision measurements and nanotechnology .",
    "we thank g. bruun , j. cremon and j. smyrnakis for useful discussions .",
    "this work was financed by the swedish research council .",
    "this project originated from a collaboration within the polatom research networking programme of the european science foundation ( esf ) .",
    "the interaction between two dipoles with dipole moment @xmath106 located at the positions @xmath107 and @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 where @xmath29 is the angle between the relative position vector @xmath30 and @xmath110 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath111 and @xmath23 is given in sec.ii .",
