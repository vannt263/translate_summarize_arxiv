    "the queueing theory has been considerably studied since erlang started designing telephone exchanging system in 1909 @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", he developed the theory of the call - loss system , which significantly contributed to the progress of telephones and electric communication systems .",
    "after his study , kendall presented his first paper @xcite .",
    "since then , the study on the queueing theory including kendall s notation @xcite , burke s theorem @xcite , jackson networks @xcite , and little s theorem @xcite has been accelerated .",
    "nowadays , it is applied to study on social systems such as the internet , resource management systems , vehicular traffic systems and pedestrian traffic systems .",
    "let us review here the discrete - time m / m/1 queueing process , which will be extended in the next section .",
    "m / m/1 means that the queue has a markovian entry of customers and a markovian exit at 1 server .",
    "each particle ( customer ) enters the system with a probability @xmath0 and receives service with a probability @xmath1 , see figure [ fig : mm1q ] .",
    "the system is characterized only by the number @xmath2 of particles .",
    "the probability @xmath3 of finding @xmath4 particles at time @xmath5 is governed by the following master equation : @xmath6 for @xmath7 . when @xmath8 , a unique stationary - state solution to the master equation can be easily obtained as the following geometric distribution : @xmath9 the average number of particles can be easily calculated as @xmath10    on the other hand , the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) in one dimension is one of typical interacting particle systems and admits exact analyses of non - equilibrium properties @xcite . it has been vigorously studied in the recent two decades . the stationary state of the totally asep with open boundaries ( open tasep ) was found in a matrix product form in @xcite . since then , matrix product stationary states of various generalizations of the asep containing discrete - time versions of the open tasep have been found @xcite .",
    "the tasep is one of the basic models of the vehicular traffic .    although both the m / m/1 queueing process and the open tasep are markov processes with particle entry and exit , they are different in the following two points .",
    "first , the number of particles in the m / m/1 queueing process does not have an upper limit , whereas that in the open tasep can not be greater than the fixed number of sites . in other words , the state space of the m / m/1 queueing process is infinite and that of the open tasep is finite .",
    "it should be noticed that the open tasep is a call - loss system , which has been seldom discussed .",
    "second , the tasep has a spatial structure , and particles are affected by their excluded volume ( hard - core repulsion ) . by contrast , the m / m/1 queueing process has no spatial structure , and only the number of particles characterizes the system .",
    "an extension of the m / m/1 queueing process with the excluded - volume effect ( in other words , the tasep with a new boundary condition ) was introduced in @xcite . in this model , particles enter the system at the left site next to the leftmost occupied site and exit at the rightmost site of the chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eq ] .",
    "when we ( pedestrians ) make a queue , we usually proceed if there is a space in front of us ( excluded - volume effect ) , which is a motivation to treat this model .",
    "let us call the model _ exclusive queueing process_.    in @xcite , a stationary state of the exclusive queueing process was given by a slightly arranged matrix product form for the open tasep , where the probability of finding each configuration is proportional to @xmath11 the row vector , the matrices and the column vector are independent of the entry rate @xmath0 , whereas @xmath12 is independent of the exit rate @xmath1 .",
    "the exponent @xmath13 denotes the position of the leftmost particle .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a discrete - time version of the exclusive queueing process with the entry , hopping and exit rates ( @xmath14 and @xmath1 , respectively ) replaced by probabilities within one time step .",
    "although there are some choices of an update scheme , we take the fully - parallel - update rule . the special case where the bulk hopping is deterministic ( i.e. , the hopping probability is 1 ) has been analyzed in @xcite .    to find a stationary - state solution is one of basic problems",
    "the idea to find it in this paper is reducing the balance equation for the exclusive queueing process to that for the open tasep .",
    "then , a stationary - state solution will be obtained in a similar form to that for the continuous - time model as .",
    "we calculate the critical line which separates the parameter space into the regions with and without the stationary state by evaluating the convergence of the normalization constant .",
    "the critical line will be written in terms of the stationary current of the open tasep .",
    "we calculate the average length of the system ( the position of the leftmost particle ) and the average number of particles in the system .",
    "we also calculate the average number of particles in the queue .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ model ] , we define the exclusive queueing process with discrete time . in sect .",
    "[ stat - state ] , we obtain a stationary state of the model . in sect .",
    "[ pdav ] , we identify the region where the stationary state exists in the parameter space , and calculate the average length of the system and the average number of particles . in sect . [",
    "sec : p=1 ] , we treat the model in the case where the bulk hopping probability is 1 . section [ conc ]",
    "is devoted to the conclusion of this paper .",
    "detailed calculations are done in appendices .",
    "we introduce an extension of the discrete - time m / m/1 queueing process with the excluded - volume effect on the semi - infinite chain ( exclusive queueing process ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eq ] , where each site is labeled by a natural number from right to left .",
    "each particle enters the chain at the left site next to the leftmost occupied site with a probability @xmath0 , hops to its right nearest neighbor site with a probability @xmath15 , if it is empty , and exits at the right end of the chain with a probability @xmath1 .",
    "if there is no particle on the chain , a particle enters at site 1 .",
    "these transitions occur simultaneously within one time step . in other words , we take the fully - parallel - update scheme .",
    "( we call it simply parallel update hereafter . )",
    "the model is formulated as a discrete - time markov process on the state space @xmath16 where 0 and 1 correspond to unoccupied and occupied sites , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 denotes the state that there is no particle on the chain .",
    "note that we do not write infinite 0s located left to the leftmost 1 .",
    "we define @xmath18 by the length of a sequence @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , for each element @xmath19 of @xmath20 , @xmath18 stands for the length of the system ( the position of the leftmost occupied site ) .",
    "let us write the probability of finding a configuration @xmath19 at time @xmath5 as @xmath21 .",
    "the master equation governing the model is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the transition - probability matrix of the process and @xmath24 is the transition probability from @xmath25 to @xmath19 within one time step .",
    "in particular , for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 it is difficult to write down the action of @xmath23 explicitly for the general configuration @xmath19 because of the parallel update .",
    "for example , for @xmath29 , @xmath30 see fig .",
    "[ fig:101101 ] , and for @xmath31 , @xmath32 see fig .",
    "[ fig:100100 ] .     with a non - zero probability within one time step.,height=215 ]     with a non - zero probability within one time step.,height=170 ]    note that this model is not equivalent to the parallel - update tasep with the ordinary open boundary condition ( open tasep ) @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : opentasep ] .        in the open tasep , particles can enter the system at the fixed leftmost site of the finite chain only if it is empty .",
    "this means that the open tasep is a call - loss system .",
    "on the other hand , in our model , particles can always enter the system .",
    "a stationary state ( stationary distribution ) is a solution to the balance equation @xmath33 with the constraint @xmath34 let us begin with making an assumption that the stationary - state solution has the following form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a function on @xmath37 and satisfies @xmath38    from @xmath39 , we get @xmath40 from @xmath41 , we get @xmath42 thus , @xmath43 we reduce the balance equation for the general configuration to that for the open tasep .",
    "one can obtain , for all @xmath44 with length @xmath13 , @xmath45 for all @xmath46 with length @xmath13 , @xmath47 and for all @xmath48 with length @xmath13 , @xmath49 see appendix [ appa ] for detailed calculation .",
    "the sets @xmath50 are defined as @xmath51 for example , @xmath52 equations - give the balance equation for the open tasep on the @xmath13-site chain with the entry probability equal to 1 if we regard @xmath53 as the probability of finding a configuration @xmath19 .",
    "thus , if we set @xmath36 to be proportional to the stationary - state solution to the open tasep , the form and gives a stationary - state solution to our model . substituting the matrix product solution to the open tasep which was found in @xcite into",
    ", we obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are matrices , @xmath57 is a row vector and @xmath58 is a column vector",
    ". they should satisfy @xmath59 which is the algebraic relation found in @xcite with @xmath60 .",
    "this algebraic relation is compatible with the assumption - .",
    "a representation of the relation is given in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "in view of , we have to chose the normalization as @xmath61 note that , from the algebraic relation , we can derive @xmath62 , which is compatible with .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath63 is expressed as @xmath64 when the right - hand side converges .",
    "this form is similar to the generating function of the normalization constant of the open tasep .",
    "the function @xmath65 is useful to calculate the average length of the system and the average number of particles .",
    "the case where @xmath66 and @xmath67 corresponds to the normalization constant : @xmath68    we can easily solve the balance equation of the usual m / m/1 queue recursively .",
    "( the equation is just a three - term recurrence formula . ) in our model , however , we have not found a recursive way to solve the balance equation . in this sense , our assumption and",
    "is truly an ansatz ( or working hypothesis ) .    in the continuous - time case",
    ", a similar form gives its stationary state except that @xmath69 is replaced by @xmath0 , and an overall constant @xmath70 appears instead that the first @xmath71 in the matrix product disappears , see ( 25 ) in @xcite .",
    "however , the continuous - time limit ( first replace @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and then take the limit @xmath74 ) of the solution is exactly the same as the solution to the continuous - time model .    at this stage , we do not know if the power series for @xmath63 ( the right - hand side of ) converges and the solution is meaningful . note that the form without the normalization constant always gives a stationary measure of our model , which is a solution to the balance equation without the constraint .",
    "if a process on a countable state space is irreducible and recurrent , and has two stationary measures @xmath75 and @xmath76 , then @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath76 ( proposition ii.1.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , if an irreducible process has a stationary state , the process is ( positive ) recurrent and thus its stationary state is unique ( theorem ii.1.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "our process is easily seen to be irreducible for generic @xmath77 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus the stationary state is unique if the power series for @xmath63 converges and there is no ( normalizable ) stationary state if it diverges ( corollary ii.1.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "in the next section , we obtain the condition on the parameters such that the power series for @xmath63 converges and a more explicit closed form for @xmath63 .",
    "we can derive the following closed form for @xmath78 , see appendix [ appb ] for details : @xmath79 where @xmath80 the power series for @xmath81 ( the right - hand side of with @xmath67 ) converges to @xmath82 when @xmath83 replacing @xmath84 by @xmath85 , we obtain the region where the power series for @xmath63 ( the right - hand side of ) converges as @xmath86 and its closed form as @xmath87 where @xmath88 .    as we see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdgen ] , the region is embedded in the region @xmath8 where the usual m / m/1 queueing process converges . the critical line @xmath89 consists of two parts ; a curve and a straight line .",
    "mathematically , the curve is given by a solution to the denominator of the form @xmath90 , and the straight line by a solution to @xmath91 .",
    "physically , the two parts correspond to the stationary current of the open tasep in the high - density phase ( @xmath92 ) and the maximal - current phase ( @xmath93 ) , respectively , see table [ tab : disccont ] .",
    "this property is due to the form .",
    "in fact , the stationary current of the open tasep on @xmath13-site chain with the entry probability 1 is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the coefficient of @xmath96 in @xmath81 .",
