    "the electron spin confined in a semiconductor quantum dot is a promising candidate for the qubit  @xcite . since the pioneering work of loss and divincenzo in 1998  @xcite , spin quantum computing has become an important research area .",
    "there have been many theoretical and experimental advances in the subsequent decades .",
    "qubit initialization  @xcite , coherent manipulation  @xcite , and single shot readout  @xcite can be achieved with high precision .",
    "the quantum dot spin qubit has many advantages .",
    "for example , spin has a relative long coherence time ( in comparison with the qubit manipulation time )  @xcite , the two - qubit manipulation can be easily achieved by using the heisenberg exchange interaction  @xcite , and it is more or less much easier to achieve the qubit scalability .",
    "single spin manipulation can be achieved by using the traditional electron spin resonance technique  @xcite .",
    "this method not only needs a static zeeman field , but also needs a perpendicular ac magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "when the frequency of the ac field matches the electron zeeman splitting , one achieves coherent spin rotation .",
    "however , it is difficult to produce a local ac magnetic field experimentally  @xcite .",
    "recently , instead of an ac magnetic field , an ac electric field has been used to manipulate a single electron spin , an effect called electric - dipole spin resonance ( edsr )  @xcite .",
    "it is much easier to produce a local ac electric field in experiments .",
    "we can explain quantum dot edsr in the following simple way .",
    "in absence of electric driving , the electron s spin degree of freedom is mixed with its orbital degree of freedom due to some mechanisms , e.g. , the slanted magnetic field  @xcite , spin - orbit coupling  @xcite , and the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an ac electric field can induce electric - dipole transitions between the electron zeeman levels .",
    "the hyperfine interaction mediated edsr was first observed experimentally in 2007  @xcite .",
    "the hallmarks of this mechanism are listed as follows .",
    "first , under electric driving , there is no rabi oscillation , i.e. , no periodical revival of the spin polarization  @xcite ; the spin - flip probability monotonically increases to a saturating value .",
    "second , the rabi frequency is independent of the zeeman field  @xcite .",
    "third , if there is no frequency modulation ( fm ) of the driving electric field , the electron spin can not be flipped  @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical investigation into the hyperfine mechanism was given by rashba  @xcite , who provides deep insight into the physics behind the edsr effect .",
    "however , the developed theory was built on the mean field approximation , and , in particular , the effects of fm were not explored .    in this paper , we re - address the mechanism of hyperfine interaction mediated edsr in the presence of fm .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .",
    "first , we derive an analytical expression for the spin - flip probability where we do not take any mean field approximation .",
    "the spin - flip probability is expressed by a summation over a large number of periodic functions such that the oscillating behaviour of each periodic function is covered by the summation .",
    "second , under fixed - frequency driving , the spin can not be flipped . because the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction brings an inhomogeneous broadening to the spin splitting ; the fixed driving frequency can not match the inhomogeneously broadened spin splitting .",
    "third , fm is used to broaden the frequency spectrum of the driving electric field .",
    "when the width of the frequency spectrum is larger than the width of the fluctuated hyperfine field , the spin - flip probability can be greatly improved .",
    "in order to explicitly show the underlying physics of hyperfine interaction mediated edsr , we first study this phenomena in a simple quasi-1d quantum dot .",
    "in fact , a quantum dot with quasi-1d confinement , e.g. , an inas  @xcite or an insb  @xcite nanowire quantum dot can already be fabricated experimentally .",
    "therefore , we confront the following total hamiltonian @xmath0,\\label{eq_originalhamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the effective electron mass , @xmath3 is the orbital energy of the quantum dot , @xmath4 is the strength of the electron - nucleus hyperfine coupling , @xmath5 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the electron and the @xmath10-th nuclear spin operators , respectively , @xmath11 is the total number of the nuclear spins in the dot , @xmath12 is the site of the @xmath10-th nuclear spin , and @xmath13 is the modulated frequency of the driving electric field .",
    "we have introduced the concept of fm in eq .",
    "( [ eq_originalhamiltonian ] ) , where the frequency of the driving field is time dependent . in this paper",
    ", we will study both the fixed - frequency driving case , i.e. , @xmath14 , and the modulated - frequency driving case , i.e. , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the modulation amplitude and the modulation frequency , respectively .",
    "our first step is to calculate the spin splitting and the corresponding wavefunctions in the quantum dot in the presence of both an external magnetic field and a hyperfine field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dot in the absence of the driving term can be divided into two parts @xmath18\\delta(x - x_{l}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electron and the @xmath10-th nuclear spin raising / lowering operators , respectively . note that the spin quantization direction here is along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the full quantum mechanical solution to the time - independent schrdinger equation is impossible because the hyperfine term @xmath22 is coordinate - dependent .",
    "however , when the zeeman field @xmath23 is strong enough , i.e. , the zeeman field is much larger than the hyperfine field , we can solve the energy spectrum by treating @xmath22 as a perturbation .",
    "the related physical quantities should satisfy the following perturbation condition : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath10-th electron - nuclear hyperfine coupling coefficient .",
    "the definition of this coefficient is given in a later equation  ( [ eq_hyperfine_coeff ] ) .",
    "it is easy to find the zeroth order eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions : @xmath26 is the main quantum number , @xmath27 is the electron spin quantum number , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the @xmath11-bit binary representation of a decimal number @xmath31 , with @xmath32 being the @xmath10-th nuclear spin quantum number , and @xmath33 is the eigenfunction of the harmonic oscillator , e.g. , @xmath34,\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi_{1}(x)&=&2^{1/2}/(\\pi^{1/4}x^{1/2}_{0})(x / x_{0}){\\rm exp}\\left[-x^{2}/(2x^{2}_{0})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 being the characteristic length of the quantum dot .",
    "the electron in the quantum dot should occupy the lowest orbital level , i.e. , @xmath36 . therefore , in the following we only focus on @xmath36 zeeman levels @xmath37 .    the energy spectrum of the quantum dot in the presence of the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction . ]",
    "it should be noted that , up to the zeroth order , each energy level has a degeneracy of @xmath38 ( see equation  ( [ eq_energy_zero ] ) ) .",
    "however , the perturbation @xmath22 does not mix the states in the degenerate subspace . therefore ,",
    "in our following calculation we can use the non - degenerate perturbation formulas  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath10-th electron - nucleus hyperfine coupling coefficient .",
    "the hyperfine energy structure of the quantum dot is schematically shown in figure  [ fig_energyspectrum ] .",
    "the corresponding first - order perturbation wavefunctions read @xmath41 thus , it can be seen clearly from equation  ( [ eq_wavefunction ] ) that , owing to the hyperfine interaction , the spin and the orbital degrees of freedom of the electron are mixed .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the electric field will induce the transitions between the up zeeman level and the down zeeman level .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the edsr effect under fixed - frequency driving .",
    "the driving hamiltonian is written as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the driving frequency .",
    "although the electron spin splitting is broadened by the hyperfine interaction ( see equation  ( [ eq_hyperfine_coeff ] ) and figure  [ fig_energyspectrum ] ) , we still choose the driving frequency to satisfy the ` resonant ' condition , i.e. , @xmath44 .    as we have shown in figure  [ fig_energyspectrum ] , each zeeman ( both the up and the down ) level has been broadened to a series of sublevels , where @xmath45 is the sublevel index .",
    "so what is the initial state for the coupled electron - nuclear system ? because the nuclear zeeman splitting is much less than the boltzmann energy @xmath46 , with @xmath47k being the temperature of the experiments .",
    "it is a good approximation to assume that the nuclear spin ensemble is totally unpolarized . in other words , in the initial mixed state of the total electron - nucleus system , each pure state @xmath48 has the equal probability @xmath49 here , we have let the electron initially be in the spin - up state @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "schematic diagram of the electric - dipole transition between the state @xmath48 and the state @xmath52 . in other words",
    ", the driving electric field assists the electron - nucleus spin - flip - flop process .",
    "there is an exchange of spin polarization between the electron and the @xmath10-th nucleus . ]    under electric driving , we want to calculate the electron spin - flip rate for the initial mixed state given in equation  ( [ eq_initialstate ] ) . our first step is to calculate the spin - flip rate for the initial pure state @xmath48 . from equation  ( [ eq_wavefunction ] )",
    ", we can calculate the electric - dipole transition element between the state @xmath48 and the state @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "similar results were also obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the above equation tells us that the electron - nucleus spin - flip - flop process is assisted by the driving electric field ( see figure  [ fig_flipflop ] ) .",
    "there is an exchange of the spin polarization between the electron and the @xmath10-th nucleus .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath56 in equation  ( [ eq_transitionrate ] ) automatically guarantees the feasibility of this flip - flop process , i.e. , only when @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "the energy difference between these two states reads @xmath59 there arises another problem : under electric driving there are many quantum states with which the state @xmath48 can flip - flop , as long as the @xmath10-th bit in @xmath60 has the value @xmath57 @xmath61 . despite this",
    ", the spin - flip probability for the initial pure sate @xmath48 still has a simple expression ( for details see appendix  [ appendix_a ] ) @xmath62 where    @xmath63^{1/2}.\\label{eq_inversion_parameters}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath64 is the detuning introduced by the hyperfine field and @xmath65 is the rabi frequency in the presence of the detuning .",
    "therefore , for the initial pure state @xmath48 , we obtain a simple rabi formula  @xcite for the spin - flip probability . as we can see from equations  ( [ eq_transitionrate ] ) and ( [ eq_inversion_parameters ] ) ,",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath65 is independent of the magnetic field , which is consistent with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "since we have already obtained the spin - flip probability for the initial pure state , the generalization to the initial mixed state  ( [ eq_initialstate ] ) is simple .",
    "the spin - flip probability for the initial mixed state reads as @xmath66 this is just a summation over all the pure state s spin - flip probability .",
    "because equation  ( [ eq_inversion ] ) is summed over a large number of periodic functions , @xmath67 may not contain the oscillating behaviour when @xmath11 is very large .    in figure  ( [ fig_edsrwithoutfm ] )",
    ", we show the spin - flip probability as a function of the driving time .",
    "as we can see , under fixed frequency driving ( @xmath44 ) , the electron spin almost can not be flipped ; the maximal spin - down probability is only @xmath68 .",
    "this very low spin - flip probability has not been observed in experiment  @xcite .",
    "therefore , under fixed - frequency driving , edsr actually can not occur .",
    "we will explain why the spin - flip probability is very low in the next subsection .",
    "the spin down probability under the fixed - frequency driving .",
    "the quantum dot parameters are chosen as @xmath69 nm , @xmath70 mhz , and @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath11 is the total number of the nuclear spins in the quantum dot and the nuclear spins are equal - distance distributed in the quantum dot . ]      as we have explicitly shown in the above subsection , each pure state @xmath48 in the initial mixed state ( see equation  ( [ eq_initialstate ] ) ) brings a detuning @xmath64 to the spin - flip probability @xmath67 ( see equations  ( [ eq_detuning ] ) and ( [ eq_inversion ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath45 runs one by one from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , the value of the detuning @xmath64 has a distribution function .",
    "actually , this distribution describes the fluctuation of the hyperfine field .",
    "the distribution function approximately reads  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the width of the hyperfine field fluctuation . therefore , under fixed - frequency driving ( e.g. , @xmath76 ) , the detuning @xmath77 is not fixed .",
    "this is the essential reason that leads to the very low spin - flip probability .",
    "the bessel function @xmath90 as a function of the index @xmath10 for large modulation index @xmath86 . for @xmath87 , @xmath88 . ]    from equation  ( [ eq_fmdriving ] ) , it is easy to find that the frequency spectrum of the driving electric field has been broadened by the fm .",
    "the frequency of the driving now can run from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 can be considered as the width of the frequency spectrum .",
    "this frequency spectrum broadening is very useful . as we have shown in equation  ( [ eq_distribution ] ) , the detuning @xmath77 , i.e. , the hyperfine field , also has a distribution which approximately ranges from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the inhomogeneously broadened spin splitting is ranged from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "when the width of the frequency spectrum @xmath16 is larger than the width of the fluctuating hyperfine field @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath98 the detuing @xmath77 will not appear in the spin - flip probability @xmath67 .",
    "because for each initial pure state @xmath48 the broadened spin splitting is @xmath99 ( see equation  ( [ eq_broadenzeeman ] ) ) , we can always find a special mode @xmath10 in the driving field that matches this splitting , where @xmath100 thus , the @xmath10-th mode @xmath101 $ ] , where @xmath102 , is in resonance with this broadened spin splitting @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the spin - flip probability under the fm can be written as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the rabi frequency under the fm .",
    "when the detuning @xmath64 is absent from the rabi frequency , the spin - flip probability can been greatly improved . in figure",
    "[ fig_edsrfm ] , we show the spin - flip probability as a function of the driving time under fm . we find that the maximal spin - flip probability increases from 0.2 ( see figure  [ fig_edsrwithoutfm ] ) to 0.7 ( see figure  [ fig_edsrfm ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the experimental observation that the edsr can only be observed under fm  @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the experimentally observed maximal spin - flip probability is also about 0.7  @xcite .",
    "the spin down probability under modulated frequency driving .",
    "the modulation parameters are chosen as @xmath86 and @xmath105 mhz .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in figure  [ fig_edsrwithoutfm ] . ]    because the spin - flip probability @xmath67 is still expressed by a summation over a large number of periodical functions ( see equation  ( [ eq_inversion_fm ] ) ) , the rabi oscillation may not appear when @xmath11 is larger .",
    "if @xmath11 is not large enough , e.g. , @xmath106 or @xmath107 , as we show in figures  [ fig_edsrwithoutfm ] and [ fig_edsrfm ] , there is still an oscillation for the spin - flip probability , but the amplitude of the oscillation is small .",
    "most gated quantum dots fabricated from semiconductor heterostructures , e.g. , gaas / algaas heterostructures , are confined in 2d . here",
    "we move to consider the edsr effect in a quantum dot with quasi-2d confinement . as we have already explored the physics of edsr in a quasi-1d quantum dot ,",
    "the generalization from 1d to 2d is natural .",
    "as we show in the following , the underlying physics does not change , except the calculations are a little more complicated .",
    "we focus on the following hamiltonian @xmath108,\\label{eq_hamiltonian2d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is the site of the @xmath10-th nuclear spin .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field is applied along the @xmath21 direction , the ac electric - field is also applied along this direction .",
    "this is the simplest hamiltonian that captures the main physics of edsr in a quantum dot with quasi-2d confinement .",
    "the calculations here are completely similar to the 1d case ; the dimension @xmath112 in equation  ( [ eq_hamiltonian2d ] ) only introduces the calculation complexities . the transition element defined in equation  ( [ eq_transitionrate ] ) for the 2d case",
    "is modified to @xmath113 also , the hyperfine coupling coefficient for the quantum dot with 2d confinement is defined as @xmath114 under fixed - frequency driving , the expression of the spin - flip probability is exactly the same as that given by equations  ( [ eq_inversion_purestate])-([eq_inversion ] ) .",
    "also , under fm , the expression of the spin - flip probability still has the form shown in equation  ( [ eq_inversion_fm ] ) . for a realistic gated gaas quantum dot ,",
    "the total number of the nuclear spins in the quantum dot is about @xmath115 .",
    "this number is too huge .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to calculate the spin - flip probability @xmath67 via equations  ( [ eq_inversion ] ) and ( [ eq_inversion_fm ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we only discuss some general properties of edsr in a quasi-2d quantum dot .",
    "these properties are closely related to the experimental observations .",
    "firstly , for a quantum dot with quasi-2d confinement , the rabi frequency is still independent of the external magnetic field . as we can see from equations ( [ eq_inversion_parameters ] ) and",
    "( [ eq_inversion_fm ] ) , where @xmath116 and @xmath25 are defined in equations  ( [ eq_2dtransitionelement ] ) and ( [ eq_2dhyperfinecoefficient ] ) , respectively , both @xmath65 and @xmath117 do not depend on the magnetic field strength @xmath118 .",
    "this is consistent with experimental observations  @xcite .    secondly , for a gated gaas quantum dot , the width of the hyperfine field fluctuation is about @xmath119 mhz ( 0.1 @xmath120ev )  @xcite .",
    "this quantity sets a lower bound on the modulation amplitude : @xmath121 in order to observe the edsr more efficiently , it is better to let the modulation amplitude be larger than @xmath122 mhz .",
    "this result is also consistent with experimental observations .",
    "an early experiment used a 36 mhz modulation amplitude  @xcite and a more recent experiment used both 40 and 75 mhz modulation amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction , which commonly exists in iii - v semiconductor quantum dots , is often considered as a nuisance because it can lead to spin decoherence  @xcite . on the other hand , we can make use of the hyperfine interaction . the hyperfine interaction mediates an interaction between the spin and an external electric field that can facilitate the single spin manipulation .    in this paper , we give a detailed theoretical investigation to the mechanism of the hyperfine interaction mediated edsr .",
    "we emphasize the importance of fm to the driving electric field in this hyperfine mechanism .",
    "the spin - flip probability is expressed by a summation over a large number of periodical functions such that there is no rabi oscillation for the spin - flip probability .",
    "because the hyperfine field gives an inhomogeneous broadening to the spin splitting , the fixed - frequency driving almost can not flip the electron spin .",
    "fm of the driving field can greatly improve the spin - flip efficiency ; there is approximately a 50% improvement in the spin - flip probability .",
    "also , the width of hyperfine field fluctuation sets a lower bound on the modulation amplitude .",
    "our theory is in qualitatively good agreement with the experimental observations .",

    "<S> the electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot can be coherently controlled by an external electric field , an effect called electric - dipole spin resonance ( edsr ) . </S>",
    "<S> several mechanisms can give rise to the edsr effect , among which there is a hyperfine mechanism , where the spin - electric coupling is mediated by the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction . here , we investigate the influence of frequency modulation ( fm ) on the spin - flip efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that fm plays an important role in the hyperfine mechanism . without fm , the electric field </S>",
    "<S> almost can not flip the electron spin ; the spin - flip probability is only about 20% . while under fm , the spin - flip probability can be improved to approximately 70% . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the modulation amplitude has a lower bound , which is related to the width of the fluctuated hyperfine field . </S>"
