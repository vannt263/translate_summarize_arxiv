    "cube diagrams , introduced in baldridge and lowrance  @xcite , are 3-dimensional representations of knots or links .",
    "we define cube diagrams carefully in section 3 .",
    "the easiest way to imagine a cube diagram is to think of an embedding of a knot or link in a @xmath0\\times [ 0,n]\\times [ 0,n]$ ] cube ( using @xmath1 coordinates ) for some positive integer @xmath2 such that the knot projection of the cube to each axis plane ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) is a grid diagram .",
    "the integer @xmath2 is called the _ size _ of the cube diagram and we will refer to a cube diagram as `` small '' if its size is close to the crossing number of the knot .",
    "small cube diagrams are very useful for computing and testing for knot invariants using computers  calculating certain invariants of cube diagrams with size @xmath6 can be computationally intractable for most computers . in this paper",
    "we discuss why small cube diagrams can be elusive to find for a given knot or link and we give examples of small cube diagrams ( @xmath7 ) for knots with seven crossings or less .",
    "in particular , the appendix gives pictures of the cube diagrams we have generated .",
    "a mathematica program @xcite can be downloaded from ` http://cubeknots.googlecode.com ` that can be used to calculate invariants of cube diagrams and also to rotate in 3-dimensions the examples in this paper .",
    "grid diagrams and cube diagrams are useful representations in knot theory . in 1996",
    "cromwell used grid diagrams as ways to represent embeddings of knots in open books ( c.f .",
    "he described a set of elementary grid moves that preserve topological knot type that can be used to check for knot invariants .",
    "more recently grid diagrams were used in constructing a combinatorial version of knot floer homology ( c.f . @xcite and @xcite ) and they provide a natural presentation of the front projection of a legendrian knot ( c.f . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "cube diagrams share many similarities with grid diagrams . like grid diagrams ,",
    "there is set of elementary cube moves that preserve the knot type and there is a combinatorial knot floer homology that can be computed from a cube diagram @xcite .",
    "however , cube diagrams have also appeared independent of grid diagrams in the study of unstable vassiliev theory @xcite .",
    "in order to find small cube diagrams , it is important to understand how they are different from grid diagrams . in this section",
    "we discuss the problem of lifting a grid diagram to a cube diagram .",
    "a grid diagram @xmath8 is an @xmath9 square grid decorated with @xmath10 and @xmath11 markings in such a way that every row ( resp .",
    "column ) contains exactly one @xmath10 and one @xmath11 marking . to get an oriented knot or link projection from a grid diagram one draws edges from @xmath10 to @xmath11 in each column and from @xmath11 to @xmath10 in each row , taking the vertical segment as the over crossing at any intersection ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "since each of the three projections of a cube diagram is a grid diagram , it is natural to think of a cube diagram as a lift of a grid diagram of one of the three projections .",
    "such a lift is clearly not unique .",
    "what is not obvious is that many times such lifts do not exist : a given grid diagram does not necessarily lift to an embedding of a knot or link in a lattice in an @xmath12 cube such that the projection to each plane is a well - defined knot projection ( it can lift to an embedding , but the intersections in the other two projections are not necessarily isolated double points ) . for an example of a grid diagram that can not be the projection of such a lattice knot see @xcite .",
    "the lifting problem to a true cube diagram is harder than just finding a lift of a grid diagram in 3-space such that the other two projections are valid knot projections .",
    "even when a grid diagram does lift to such an embedding , that embedding is rarely a cube diagram and the chances that a grid diagram lifts to a cube diagram appears to decrease as the grid size increases . to support this assertion we wrote a brute - force program to get statistics on grid diagrams that lift to cube diagrams .",
    "the program looked at all size @xmath13 grid diagrams and tested whether each grid diagram was a nontrivial knot ( we did not consider links ) and whether each grid diagram lifted to a cube diagram .",
    "the data for grid diagrams for nontrivial knots are presented below ."
