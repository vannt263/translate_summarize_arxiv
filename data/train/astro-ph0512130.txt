    "the most immediate relics of the early galaxy are the cool subdwarfs of spectral type sdk and later  lifetimes of such cool stars are well in excess of the age of the galaxy . their metal - deficient atmospheres make them appear hotter than solar - metallicity main - sequence stars of the same mass , which in turn renders them `` subluminous '' @xcite .",
    "the spectral classification of solar abundance k- and m - dwarfs is well understood , and is entirely due to changes in effective temperature .",
    "classification of m - subdwarfs is based on the metallicity sensitive ratio of absorption bands of metal - oxides and metal - hydrides @xcite ; metal - hydrides are generally stronger in metal - deficient atmospheres , while metal - oxides are weaker ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in the ultracool atmospheres of late m- and l - dwarfs",
    ", however , refractory grains become an important ingredient since they are competing with molecules for available metals . furthermore",
    ", their opacity influences the optical depth , and hence which part of the atmosphere is visible .",
    "since the formation and distribution of dust grains is not well understood even in solar abundance stars , this is an even more severe problem in the classification of metal - deficient l - subdwarfs .",
    "the last two years have seen the first discoveries of l - type subdwarfs .",
    "these ultracool dwarfs exhibit colors too red for an m - type object , and do not fit on the expanded subdwarf classification scheme of @xcite . another argument for surface temperatures lower than m - dwarf temperatures is the extremely strong absorption lines of alkali atoms as k  i , na  i , and rb  i. the first l - type subdwarf , 2mass  j05325346 + 8246465 ( hereafter 2mass0532 + 8246 ) , was discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b03 ) .",
    "its spectrum is very similar to the l7 dwarf denis  02051159ab , exhibiting strong alkali lines ( we use the optical classification scheme of * ? ? ?",
    "2mass0532 + 8246  shows enhanced metal hydride bands , but in contrast to m - subdwarfs it also has strongly enhanced bands of tio .",
    "the first proposed early - type l - subdwarf , lsr  16100040 , was discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l03 ) .",
    "it also exhibits strong rb  i absorption and l03 report enhanced cah and tio bands .",
    "metal hydrides feh and crh , however , are relatively weak .",
    "we conclude in this paper that lsr  16100040  is not really an l subdwarf , but in the m temperature range .",
    "the same conclusion is reached in a paper based on lower resolution spectra that was posted during our refereeing process by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter cv05 ) .",
    "the spectral peculiarities of these unusual objects provide a preview of the complex chemical processes occurring in cool atmospheres of metal - deficient l - dwarfs .",
    "the list of subdwarfs of spectral type l and late m is constantly growing ; @xcite discovered the l - subdwarf lsr  @xmath3 , and two late m - type subdwarfs at the end of the subdwarf classification scheme with features very similar to the l - type subdwarfs have been reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ssspm  j10131356 ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "cool stars of spectral type k and m are known to suffer rotational braking on a relatively short timescale ( 1 gyr ) , but no projected rotation velocity below @xmath4kms@xmath2 has been reported in an l - dwarf @xcite . whether this is due to extremely long braking times or the lack of rotational braking at all in l - dwarfs may be answered by observations of the rotation of the oldest objects of very late spectral type .",

    "both targets were observed with hires at keck  i on march 2 , 2005 , after the detector upgrade . the spectral sensitivity and coverage",
    "are substantially improved after the upgrade , allowing us to obtain high - resolution spectra of these faint objects , especially in the ccd infrared . with the new ccd mosaic",
    "we were able to cover the spectral region from 5700  to 1@xmath5 m in 25 spectral orders . in the red part of the spectrum , however , spectral coverage is still incomplete .",
    "the ccd mosaic is made of three chips ; two spectral orders fall onto the gaps and could not be observed .",

    "the much fainter 2mass0532 + 8246  was observed for 45min yielding much lower a snr in the optical wavelength region .",

    "the radial velocity they derive from infrared k  i lines at 1.1690/1.1773@xmath5 m , @xmath46@xmath19@xmath47kms@xmath2 , matches much better with our value from high resolution spectra .    in order to estimate the space motion of 2mass0532 + 8246",

    "however , due to the uncertain distance , the space motion is poorly constrained and we do not include it in table[tab:2mass0532 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the likelihood of a very high @xmath24-velocity 2mass0532 + 8246  does significantly exceed the 2@xmath43 limit for disk stars , as was mentioned by b03 .",
    "for lsr  16100040 , we use three spectral orders around 8000 .",
    "we checked the reliability of our radial velocity determination by measuring @xmath45 for gj299 , gj1227 and gj1111 from observations taken during the same night . in all three cases",
    "our results show excellent agreement with the values reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relative velocity difference between lsr  16100040  and gl406 as calculated from the spectra is @xmath51kms@xmath2 after barycentric correction .",
    "our uncertainty is dominated by the star s position in the slit , and we estimate a systematic uncertainty of 1kms@xmath2 .",
    "thus , for lsr  16100040  we calculate a radial velocity of @xmath52kms@xmath2 .",
    "this results is not in agreement with the radial velocity of @xmath53kms@xmath2 reported by l03 .",
    "however , b03 calculated @xmath45 for 2mass0532 + 8246  and found a difference between their values of @xmath45 derived from optical and from infrared wavelength regions ( see sect.[sect : vradtwom ] ) . using low resolution data at optical wavelengths",
    "they obtain a radial velocity that is about 20kms@xmath2 more blueshifted than @xmath45 derived from infrared regions .",
    "as was mentioned above , our results agree with the result they get from the infrared data .",
    "we suggest that such an offset is also the reason for the mismatch between the radial velocity derived in low - resolution data at optical wavelengths by l03 and the value we derive from our high - resolution data .",
    "if we correct the radial velocity reported by l03 by the + 20kms@xmath2 reported by b03 , the corrected value is @xmath54kms@xmath2 , which is consistent with the value of @xmath55kms@xmath2 we find .    to calculate the space motion vector [ @xmath56 , we first tried to reproduce the vector reported by l03 .",
    "we use the idl procedure gal_uvw and the coordinates , proper motion and radial velocity given in l03 .",
    "however , we do not derive the same space motion ( while we do get the identical vector b03 derive for 2mass0532 + 8246 ) .",
    "our result is @xmath57$]kms@xmath2 , while l03 report @xmath58$]kms@xmath2 ( they also write slightly different values in their table1 and their sect.5 ) . including the new radial velocity for lsr  16100040  we derive our final result of @xmath50 = [ -44 , -111 , -51]$]kms@xmath2 .",
    "this places lsr  16100040   inside the @xmath59 limit of thick disk stars , as defined by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath24-velocity of lsr  16100040  of @xmath60kms@xmath2 still is indicative of halo kinematics , although it is not statistically significant in comparison to the sample of @xcite .",
    "the predominant spectral features visible in l - type spectra are molecular bandheads and strongly pressure - broadened alkali lines .",
    "neither of them allow a determination of @xmath28 by directly fitting a rotationally broadened template to the spectrum , as can be successfully done in hotter stars where the shape of unblended atomic lines indicate stellar rotation very precisely .",
    "the projected rotation velocities @xmath28 of ultralow mass objects as late as spectral type l are usually determined via cross - correlation with a slowly rotating m- or l - type object used as a template @xcite .",
    "the spectral type of the template star should be as close as possible to the target .",
    "one of the latest slow rotating m - dwarfs bright enough to be employed as a template star is gl406 ( m5.5 ) , and that star is often used for the cross - correlation technique also in l - dwarfs .",
    "it is not entirely clear to what extent spectral differences between the spectra of m- and l - type dwarfs , e.g. the severe broadening of alkali lines in l - dwarfs , could mimic a higher rotation velocity when using an m - dwarf template to derive @xmath28 in an l - dwarf .",
    "@xcite discuss this issue in detail .",
    "@xcite used the spectrum of 2mass1439 + 1929  ( l1.0 , @xmath61kms@xmath2 ) to calculate @xmath28 in his l - dwarf sample .",
    "he found no significant differences between the two values of @xmath28 he individually derived from a cross - correlation with gl406 , and with 2mass1439 + 1929 .",
    "this supports the assumption that using an m - dwarf for the template does in fact yield the correct @xmath28 as well .",
    "the slowest projected rotation velocity measured in an l - dwarf is as high as @xmath61kms@xmath2 @xcite , while mid - m dwarfs are mixed and early - m dwarfs usually have rotation velocities below the detection limit .",
    "l - dwarfs may not suffer rotational braking at all , since their neutral atmospheres could inhibit any kind of magnetic coupling that is the source of rotational braking in hotter stars @xcite .",
    "however , flares have been observed to occur in l - dwarfs and some are observed to exhibit h@xmath62 emission @xcite .",
    "this indicates at least the possibility of magnetic braking .",
    "the lack of slowly rotating l - dwarfs could also be an artifact of observing predominantly young objects since they are simply brighter than older objects of the same mass . in that case",
    "slow rotators might be found among the very oldest l - dwarfs , the subdwarf population .",
    "we calculated the cross - correlation functions of our target stars lsr  16100040  and 2mass0532 + 8246  with gl406 in several spectral orders .",
    "results from different spectral orders are consistent with each other .",
    "the cross - correlation functions of lsr  16100040  and 2mass0532 + 8246  from the wavelength region around 9150  are shown in the left and right panels of fig.[fig : xcorl ] , respectively . to calibrate the width of the cross - correlation functions",
    ", we spun up the spectrum of gl406 according to surface velocities @xmath63 and 80kms@xmath2 and calculated the cross - correlation functions with the unbroadened template of gl406 .",
    "the results are overplotted in both panels of fig.[fig : xcorl ] as dashed lines .",
    "it is immediately clear from the left panel of fig.[fig : xcorl ] that lsr  16100040  does not show any signs of a rotation faster than gl406 ( @xmath64kms@xmath2 ) .",
    "this can be viewed as support for the proposition that lsr  16100040  is more similar to gl406 than an early l dwarf ( which is expected to be a rapid rotator ) .",
    "one advantage of the cross - correlation technique is its applicability to spectra of relatively low signal .",
    "the snr of our spectrum of 2mass0532 + 8246   is much lower because of the faintness of object .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to derive reliable cross - correlation functions and determine the projected rotation velocity as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : xcorl ] . from that function ,",
    "we derive a value of @xmath65kms@xmath2 for 2mass0532 + 8246 .",
    "the uncertainty of our result can be derived from comparing results from different spectral orders ; we estimate an uncertainty of 15kms@xmath2 ( rapid rotation is more difficult to be precise with ) . if 2mass0532 + 8246   is a relic of the early galaxy , we are led to the conclusion that the braking time is longer than the age of the galaxy or there is no braking at all for such cool objects .",
    "lsr  16100040  was proposed as an early - type l - subdwarf by l03 .",
    "they find its spectral energy distribution to be completely inconsistent with a spectral type sdm6.0 , which would be the spectral classification on the basis of the standard classification scheme developed by @xcite and expanded by @xcite . on the other hand , cv05 find a good overall fit with a normal m6 dwarf . a second strong argument for a spectral type",
    "early l are the rb  i lines , which are atypically strong for a normal m dwarf .",
    "we show several spectral orders of our high resolution spectrum of lsr  16100040  in figs.[fig : lsr1610_1 ] and [ fig : lsr1610_2 ] . as a comparison",
    ", we overplot the spectra of the m - dwarf gl406 ( m5.5 ) and the early - type l - dwarf 2mass  1439 + 1929 ( l1.0 ) that we obtained during the same night .",
    "the most interesting spectral features in ultra low - mass objects and metal - poor subdwarfs are the metal - oxides , the metal - hydrides , and the strongly pressure - broadened atomic lines of alkali and alkali earth elements . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the relevant features that are visible in our spectra .",
    "the metal oxides tio and vo are the main opacity sources in late m - stars .",
    "our spectrum covers three bandheads of tio , the @xmath66-system at 7050 , the @xmath67-system at 8430 , and the infrared @xmath68-system at 8870 .",
    "tio bands are observed to become stronger with cooler effective temperature among early to mid - type m - stars . in the field dwarfs ,",
    "the tio bands in late m - dwarfs show a reversal , the @xmath66-band reaches a maximum near m6.5 , the @xmath67-band has its maximum a little later at m7.5 @xcite .",
    "the weakening of tio band - strengths in very late m - dwarfs and early l - dwarfs can be explained by the formation of more metal - rich condensate minerals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eg . ) , i.e. by the formation of dust in metal - rich field dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , dust opacity increases with shorter wavelength and the effects of dust should be visible at bluer wavelengths first .",
    "the reddest tio band at 8900  is displayed in the first panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_2 ] .",
    "the absorption in lsr  16100040  is consistent with the one in gl406 and maybe a little weaker than in 2mass1439 + 1929 , although this band does not show a clear structure and differences between the three spectra are small .",
    "the @xmath67-bands at 8450  appear very similar in the field m- and l - dwarfs since they lie on both sides of the reversal .",
    "the @xmath67-band of lsr  16100040  is much weaker , indicating metal deficiency or a temperature outside the m5.5l1 region .",
    "the third tio band at 7050 , the @xmath66-band shown in the upper right panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_1 ] , is very strong in lsr  16100040 .",
    "it is consistent with the strong absorption observed in gl406 and much weaker than in 2mass1439 + 1929 .",
    "the weakness of this band in the l1-dwarf is likely due to the onset of dust formation .",
    "the band is severely saturated in the two other spectra . at such strong saturation , the underlying opacity could be different in lsr  16100040  and gl406 while producing the same appearance in the @xmath66-band .",
    "thus , the tio bands are not inconsistent with the hypothesis , that lsr  16100040  is a metal - deficient m - dwarf .",
    "our spectrum also includes the vo band at 7900 , and we confirm the finding by l03 that vo is not strong in lsr  16100040 . in gl406",
    "this band is comparably weak , and even in 2mass1439 + 1929  vo is not particularly strong .",
    "this means that no clear conclusions about the temperature or metallicity of lsr  16100040  can be drawn from the vo bands .",
    "cv05 discuss a possible new set of bands of tio ( and perhaps h@xmath69o ) at 9200 - 9400  ( their fig .",
    "6 ) , but suggest that higher resolution spectra are needed for confirmation .",
    "we see no evidence for tio in this region , only a lot of telluric lines .      in metal poor m - dwarfs , metal hydrides",
    "are observed to be much stronger than metal oxides , which is likely due to the competition with h@xmath69o for oxygen @xcite . in lsr  16100040 , the hydride bands are comparable to those in gl406 . for example",

    "the feh band at 9900  is also of comparable strength in the last panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_2 ] .",
    "these results imply that lsr  16100040  is not very metal - poor compared to gl406 .    in 2mass1439 + 1929  ( l1 )",
    ", one expects the feh band at 9900to be stronger because the star is cooler , and this is seen in last panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_2 ] . on the other hand",
    ", the upper left panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_1 ] shows that the individual cah features are weaker in 2mass1439 + 1929  than in the other two objects as is typically observed ( although the reason for this is not really known ) .",
    "we note that the normalization in this panel is local ; the right upper panel shows that if the spectrum is normalized at 7050 , then the l1 spectrum lies above the other two .",
    "this likely indicates that the background opacity ( tio ?",
    ", vo ? ) is weaker in the l dwarf than in lsr  16100040 , probably due to dust formation in the former .",
    "@xcite suggest that absorption features of tih could become visible in spectra of ultralow mass stars , and @xcite claim a first detection of tih around 9400   in 2mass0532 + 8246  ( see sect.[sect : spectrum_twom ] ) .",

    "the suggestion of an early l - type spectral class of lsr  16100040  comes in part from the rb  i lines . according to l03 ,",

    "both lines are observed at high snr and accurately resemble the shape of the rb  i lines in 2mass1439 + 1929 , while they are much stronger than in gl406 . during our observing run",
    "we also observed two dwarfs of spectral type m9 , lhs  2065 and lhs  2924 .",
    "both show rb  i lines significantly weaker than those observed in lsr  16100040  and 2mass1439 + 1929 .",
    "thus , the behavior of the atomic lines of k  i and rb  i in our high - resolution spectrum confirms that these lines appear typical of a field early - l dwarf .",
    "the observed line strengths of the alkali elements k  i and rb  i ( and the strong lines of na  i visible in low resolution spectra of cv05 ) lead us to expect strong lines of cs  i as well .",
    "several cs  i lines are covered by our spectrum ; the two lines at 8520  and 8944  are shown in the last panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_1 ] and the first panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_2 ] , respectively .",
    "both lines are remarkably weaker than in 2mass1439 + 1929 ; the one at 8520   is about half as strong as in 2mass1439 + 1929 , while the one at 8944   is hardly detected at all .",
    "this behavior is not consistent with a an early - l object .",
    "on the other hand , the cs  i line is stronger than in gl406 , though not as comparatively strong as the rb  i lines .",
    "both cs  i lines are located directly inside tio - bands , which are weakened at lower metallicity .",
    "the reduced tio opacity should enhance the visibility of atomic lines .",
    "that explanation is supported by the presence of a relatively strong line from ba  i at 8560  ( another line of ba  i is detected at 7912  inside a vo band ) .",
    "most interesting is the clear detection of two of the ca  ii triplet lines ( at 8498 and 8542 ) .",
    "all these lines with strengths greater than in gl406 ( which does nt really show them at all ) .",
    "the triplet lines require photospheric conditions hot enough to produce ionized calcium , and tend to disappear at m6 except in very active stars ( gl406 itself is reasonably active , and yet does not show them ) . taken together , these results are consistent with a mid - m effective temperature , but with weakened background opacity due to a lower metallicity .",
    "our spectrum also covers the wavelength region around 9600 , where b03 and @xcite report the detection of a so far unidentified absorption feature .",

    ", six individual absorption features appear between 9580  and 9710 .",
    "the shape of the features clearly suggests that the absorption is due to atomic lines , and we identify all six to be due to absorption of ti  i ( a5f - z5fo ) . the reason why these lines of ti  i can be seen probably is their particularly low ground state energy .",

    "the @xmath71 m region is quite unlike any known late - type m , l , or t - dwarf spectrum , which b03 attribute to collision induced h@xmath69 absorption centered near 2.5@xmath5 m , enhanced due to metal - deficiency .",
    "the optical and @xmath13-band region they show , however , is very similar to that of the l7 dwarf denis  02051159ab , and b03 suggest that 2mass0532 + 8246  is a metal - poor late l - dwarf similar to denis  02051159ab .",
    "the main differences with denis  02051159ab  are the bands of metal hydrides and tio , which are stronger in 2mass0532 + 8246  consistent with a metal - poor atmosphere .",
    "b03 suggest that the tio bands are enhanced because production of ti - bearing condensates is inhibited in the ti depleted atmosphere , leaving ti and o for tio .",
    "the high - resolution spectrum we obtained of 2mass0532 + 8246  is of lower quality than the one shown in the previous section for lsr  16100040 .",

    "tio bands become saturated in mid m - dwarfs then weaken in late m- and l - dwarfs due to condensation of ti into refractory dust grains .",
    "the tio band at 8430  is stronger in 2mass0532 + 8246  than it is in denis  02051159ab , as mentioned by b03 .",
    "this implies that the formation of dust is more inhibited than the formation of tio in the metal - poor atmosphere of 2mass0532 + 8246 .",
    "the tio band at 8870  is compared to the l1 dwarf 2mass1439 + 1929  in the top panel of fig.[fig:2mass0532_1 ] .",
    "both have comparably strong tio bands , i.e. , the tio band of 2mass0532 + 8246  is as strong as is in a metal rich l1 dwarf , and much stronger than in a normal metallicity dwarf of spectral type l7 .",
    "the feh and crh bands at 9900  and 9970 , respectively , are stronger than in any other late type dwarf known to date ( bottom panel of fig.[fig:2mass0532_1 ] ) .",
    "their strength can be interpreted as a direct consequence of the enhanced hydride band strength in metal - poor atmospheres .",
    "a detection of tih at 9400  in the spectrum of 2mass0532 + 8246  shown in b03 was claimed by @xcite , and @xcite showed that spectral features of tih at this wavelengths may not be weak .",
    "strong tio absorption bands together with strongly enhanced bands of feh and crh support the expectation that 2mass0532 + 8246  is a very good candidate for a detection of tih absorption .",
    "we show the region around 9400  of our spectrum of 2mass0532 + 8246  compared to the spectrum of 2mass1439 + 1929  and the telluric reference spectrum of hr  153 in the second panel of fig.[fig:2mass0532_1 ] .",
    "we did not adjust the spectra for their radial velocities , in order to show the matching sets of telluric lines due to h@xmath69o .",

    "the strong alkali lines of denis  02051159ab  are accurately reproduced by the spectrum of 2mass0532 + 8246 , possibly indicating comparable temperatures in both objects .",
    "no lines of ca  ii or ba  i are detected in 2mass0532 + 8246 .",
    "since these lines are expected to be comparably weak , they can be easily hidden in the noise since they would be broadened by the strong surface rotation .",
    "cs  i is also detected at 8940 but we have no comparison spectrum of denis  02051159ab  in that region . comparison to 2mass1439 + 1929  shows that cs  i is much stronger than it is in the l1 dwarf , as expected .",
    "we show the spectral region around 9640  in the third panel of fig.[fig:2mass0532_1 ] .",
    "b03 detected an unidentified absorption feature in that region .",

    "the major absorption features visible in the spectrum of 2mass0532 + 8246  are located at the same wavelengths , and we conclude that a great part of the unidentified absorption is due to atomic ti",
    ".    the strongest absorption line at 9640  appears to have a very strong red wing ; this can not be attributed to the fast rotation velocity which only marginally broadens the line compared to the intrinsic width visible in the spectra of lsr  16100040  and 2mass1439 + 1929 .",
    "we looked at synthetic spectra at this spectral region and found that this red wing also appears in spectra at temperatures around 2000k .",
    "this absorption is probably due to lines of feh which cover the region from 9590 to 9700 .",
    "they particularly show a cluster of lines at 9643 , which we identified as a ( 00 ) band , particularly the @xmath72 transition @xcite .",
    "since feh is particularly strong in the spectrum of 2mass0532 + 8246 , it appears plausible that feh shows up in this spectral region as well , although it has not yet been observed in other l - dwarfs .",
    "a second feh bandhead , the @xmath73 transition , may also be visible at 9600 .",
    "both bandheads split into two different parities ( a  a ) and ( b  b ) .",
    "we marked them in the third panel of fig.[fig:2mass0532_1 ] .",
    "we return now to the apparent inconsistencies in the spectrum of lsr  16100040 , and the question of whether it is really m or l , and metal - poor or not .",
    "we first compare the appearance of the rb  i and cs  i lines in lsr  16100040   to spectra of gl406 ( m5.5v ) and 2mass1439 + 1929  ( l1 ) .",
    "we wish to investigate why the rb  i lines of lsr  16100040  resemble the lines 2mass1439 + 1929  while the cs  i lines of lsr  16100040  resemble those of gl406 .",
    "we compare the spectra of lsr  16100040  and 2mass1439 + 1929   to synthetic spectra calculated with the phoenix code .",
    "the temperature scale in @xcite produces an estimate of the temperature of @xmath74k for 2mass1439 + 1929  ( l1 ) , and we use a temperature of 2800k for comparison to gl406 .",
    "we adopt the hypothesis that this is the temperature appropriate to lsr  16100040 , and test models with metallicities of [ fe / h ]  =  0 and @xmath75 .    in the left panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_3 ] we show the three observed spectra and two models for the rb  i line at 7800 .",
    "the lines in lsr  16100040  and 2mass1439 + 1929  are very similar ( lsr  16100040  has a slight broader one ) .",
    "gl406 has the weakest , narrowest line .",
    "the model with solar metallicity most closely resembles gl406 ; although the line depth is deeper the line wings end at almost the same width .",
    "the metal - deficient model , on the other hand is as deep as lsr  16100040  and 2mass1439 + 1929 , and has wings which are broad , but not quite broad enough to match them .",
    "the molecular pseudo - continua around the line also match the two cases .",
    "we caution that the models still have deficiencies , and the normalization of the spectra is a matter of ( consistent ) choice , but the general agreements are heartening .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : lsr1610_3 ] shows a similar analysis for the cs  i line at 8521 .",
    "the spectra are all normalized as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsr1610_1 ] , namely outside the tio band at 8430 . the great difference between gl406 and 2mass1439 + 1929  in cs",
    "i is quite obvious , although the similar strengths of the background tio leaves their pseudo- continua at similar levels .",
    "the solar metallicity model has a similar level , and the line is sharper and deeper than gl406 , but nothing like the strength of the line for the l dwarf . lowering the metallicity yields a line strength and pseudo - continuum level that is a better match to lsr  16100040 .",
    "we thus obtain a reasonable fit to both the rb  i _ and _ cs  i lines of lsr  16100040  using approximately @xmath76k , [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath75 .",
    "this is why we would assign it a spectral type of sd?m6 .",
    "the reason for the disparate line strengths in gl406 compared with lsr  16100040  is the weakened background opacity in lsr  16100040 , which allows the line wings of rb  i ( but not cs  i , which is less abundant ) to be revealed , while they remain hidden by tio in gl406 .",
    "this is also the reason for the increased strengths of the ba  i and ca  ii lines in lsr  16100040  compared to gl406 .",
    "we have presented the first high resolution spectra of the peculiar possibly metal - poor sd?m6 lsr  16100040  and the late - type l - subdwarf 2mass0532 + 8246 .",
    "we have derived accurate radial and rotation velocities for both objects , and we compared their spectral features to spectra of known field l - dwarfs .",
    "the spectra of lsr  16100040  and 2mass0532 + 8246  are very different in many respects .",
    "these are discussed below .",
    "the radial velocity of lsr  16100040  is consistent with the value reported by l03 if we assume that their determination suffered similar systematic effects as mentioned by b03 for the case of 2mass0532 + 8246 . for the latter ,",
    "we derive a radial velocity consistent with the result of b03 .",
    "we computed the space motion in order to check membership of the halo population .",
    "our result for lsr  16100040  significantly differs from the result reported by l03 ; the radial velocity of lsr  16100040  does not fall outside the @xmath59-region reported for thick disk stars by @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath24-velocity of lsr  16100040  ( @xmath77kms@xmath2 ) is comparably high , and the space motion vector does not contradict its halo membership . for 2mass0532 + 8246 ,",
    "our estimate of the @xmath24-velocity is @xmath78kms@xmath2 , which is in strong support of halo membership .",
    "the rotation velocity of lsr  16100040  is below the detection limit of about 5kms@xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the bulk of its properties more closely resembling the m5.5v dwarf gl406 than an l1 object .",
    "we have analyzed the reasons why it was initially classified as an early - l subdwarf , and explain them with a mild metal - deficiency .",
    "for the true l subdwarf , 2mass0532 + 8246 , we measure a rotation velocity of @xmath65kms@xmath2 . if this object is indeed a relic of the young galaxy , that means that the braking time for a mid l - dwarf is much longer than 10gyr .",
    "either the braking time exceeds the age of the galaxy by this spectral type , or there is no rotational braking in mid to late l - type objects at all .    in m - subdwarfs metal - oxides",
    "are weaker and metal - hydrides are stronger than in the metal rich m - dwarfs , but both species are stronger in 2mass0532 + 8246  than in its metal - rich counterpart denis  02051159ab . the strong oxide - bands in 2mass0532 + 8246  can be explained by invoking a reduced level of dust formation in the metal - deficient atmosphere , which would leave behind more tio than in the metal rich l - dwarfs ( b03 ) .",
    "the extremely strong metal - hydride bands in 2mass0532 + 8246  are generally consistent with observations of enhanced metal - hydride bands in m - subdwarfs .",
    "chemistry and line formation in the ultracool atmospheres of l - dwarfs is much more complex than it is in hotter stars because of dust formation and depletion of refractory metals from the atmosphere .",
    "the chemical anomalies of subdwarfs heighten these complexities , and currently yield a confusing situation .",
    "high - resolution spectra provide crucial information for our eventual understanding of the ultracool metal - deficient atmospheres which were common in the early galaxy .",
