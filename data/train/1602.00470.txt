    "the dynamics of supercooled liquids and associated glass transition where viscosity or relaxation time increases dramatically with decreasing temperature still puzzle the scientific community even after decades of research @xcite .",
    "the viscosity change is so dramatic that with few tens of degrees of change in temperature , viscosity can change as much as @xmath0 orders of magnitude and the temperature at which viscosity reaches @xmath1 poise is termed the calorimetric glass transition temperature , @xmath2 .",
    "there are many interesting features seen in the dynamics of supercooled liquids approaching this calorimetric glass transition that are not observed in normal liquids .",
    "one such example is the temporal density - density correlation functions which in the supercooled temperature regime show multiple relaxation steps .",
    "the short time relaxation is termed as @xmath3-relaxation @xcite and the longer time scale relaxation is called @xmath4-relaxation as shown in fig .",
    "[ qtsketch ] .",
    "+ 0.1 cm    one of the most puzzling phenomena observed in the long time @xmath4- relaxation process is the breakdown of the famous stokes - einstein relation @xcite .",
    "this is one of the most studied phenomena in the context of supercooled liquids without a clear general consensus@xcite .",
    "thus a better understanding of this phenomena will definitely be of immediate importance for developing theory of glass transition .",
    "stokes - einstein relation connects viscosity of a liquid ( @xmath5 ) to the diffusion constant ( @xmath6 ) as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the constant of proportionality depends on the details of the probe particles used to measure the diffusion constant of the liquids .",
    "one often uses self - diffusion constants instead of tracer diffusion in the above equation for simple liquids interacting via isotropic pairwise potential .",
    "it is found that at least in the low temperature regime viscosity , @xmath5 is proportional to the long time @xmath4-relaxation time , @xmath9 @xcite ( see method section for definition ) , so it is customary in the literature to cast the stokes - einstein relation in the following form @xmath10 where @xmath5 is replaced by @xmath9 .",
    "the other reason for this modification lies in the fact that calculation of @xmath9 is much easier and straight forward than the viscosity ( notice that it is already shown in the literature that this is not the reason for breakdown in stokes - einstein relation ) .",
    "thus if one plots @xmath11 as a function of @xmath12 , then it should be temperature independent constant , but it turns out that for supercooled liquids this ratio becomes a strong function of temperature below some temperature .",
    "phenomenological arguments @xcite often assume existence of dynamic heterogeneity @xcite which means existence of mobile and less mobile dynamical regions in the supercooled liquid states in order to explain the violation of stokes - einstein relation .",
    "many previous studies indeed showed positive correlation between stokes - einstein breakdown and dynamic heterogeneity @xcite as measured by four - point density - density correlation function .",
    "sometimes a generalized version of the stokes - einstein relation @xcite is also used to describe the inter - relationship between diffusion constant and relaxation time in the supercooled regime with the following form @xmath13 where exponent @xmath14 characterizes the degree of deviation from normal stokes - einstein relation .",
    "this relation is called fractional stokes - einstein relation and in @xcite , it was shown that fractional stokes - einstein exponent can depend on the dimensionality of the system as well as on the details of the microscopic interaction between particles .    from the mean field arguments",
    ", it is expected that @xmath14 will go to zero as one increases the spatial dimensions .",
    "this expectation is broadly supported by the results reported in @xcite . a detailed numerical study on this aspect @xcite in a hard sphere glass forming liquids showed that the fractional stokes - einstein exponent @xmath14 actually goes to zero at eight dimensions .",
    "this provided for the first time a direct estimate of the upper critical dimension for glass forming liquids , above which mean field type description of the liquids should hold @xcite .",
    "one should keep in mind that computational cost increases very rapidly with increasing dimensionality of a system and simulation of any mean field model is actually a very difficult numerical task @xcite .",
    "thus it is needless to say that it would be extremely useful if one can change fractional stokes - einstein exponent with ease in a model system just by tuning some parameters .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that one can change fractional stokes - einstein exponent with ease in model systems simply by randomly pinning some fraction of particles in their equilibrium positions @xcite . here",
    "we will use this protocol to understand in depth the breakdown of stokes - einstein relation and its relation with any underlying structural changes in the liquids .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : first we will give details of the model system studied , then will give the definitions of the different dynamical quantities calculated in this study with the details of the pinning protocol used to generate random pinning in the system . then we will discuss the results obtained and finally discuss implications of these results on our understanding of breakdown of the stokes - einstein relation .",
    "* model : * we perform simulations for a model glass forming liquids in two dimensions in this work .",
    "the model is characterized by a repulsive inverse power - law potential ( 2dr10 ) @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied extensively and found to be a very good glass former .",
    "the interaction potential is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for all @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",

    "these simulations are done in the canonical ensemble using a modified leap - frog integration scheme with the berendsen thermostat .",
    "we have also performed simulation with another constant temperature simulation algorithm due to brown and clark @xcite .",
    "the results do not depend on the exact algorithm used for integrating the equations of motion .",
    "we have averaged the data over @xmath27 independent runs of length @xmath28 .",
    "+ 0.5 cm * pinning protocol : * in this study we have pinned some fraction @xmath29 of total number of particles randomly from their equilibrium configurations .",
    "first we equilibrate a system of given number of particles , @xmath30 at the studied temperatures and then we choose randomly @xmath31 number of particles from one such equilibrated configuration and pinned their positions .",
    "the advantage of such pinning protocol is that the system with the pinned particles are already in equilibrium as the positions of the pinned particles are taken from an equilibrium configurations .",
    "this procedure bypasses re - equilibration of the system after introducing these form of quenched disorder .",
    "we then do averaging over the different realizations of these pinning positions ( averaging over quenched disorder ) to calculate different thermodynamic and dynamic quantities . in this study",
    "we have done averaging of @xmath27 different realizations of disorder and we checked that this amount of averaging is enough to get reliable results .",
    "one can also pin particles in an ordered arrangements with further equilibration and results may depend on the details of the pinning protocol but we do nt expect much qualitative change in the reported results .",

    "this function quantifies the correlation of the relaxation of density fluctuations at two points separated by distance @xmath39 .",
    "a four - point susceptibility may be defined as the @xmath40 value of the fourier transform @xmath41 of this function .",
    "a variant  @xcite of this four - point function has been used extensively in numerical studies of dynamic heterogeneity because it is easier to compute .",
    "this quantity is obtained from the overlap function @xmath42 defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the position of particle @xmath45 at time @xmath36 , @xmath30 is the total number of particles and @xmath46 is the number of pinned particles .",

    "+ 0.5 cm * diffusion constant : * the diffusion constant @xmath6 for different temperatures and pinning density is calculated from the slope of the mean squared displacement using the relation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the spatial dimension and in this case @xmath61 .",
    "+ 0.5 cm * van hove function : * van hove function , @xmath62 is the probability of finding a displacement of a particle of amount @xmath63 over a timescale of @xmath36 .",
    "it is formally defined as follows @xmath64 where @xmath65 is one of the coordinates of the position of particle @xmath45 at time @xmath36 and the self part of this correlation function is defined as @xmath66 here we have calculated only self part of the van hove correlation function for simplicity .",
    "-0.2 cm    in fig.[seviolation ] , we have plotted the stokes - einstein parameter @xmath11 as a function of temperature for different pinning density .",
    "one can clearly see that the quantity is fairly independent of temperature up to some temperature for a given pinning concentration and then it start to increase , indicating the violation of stokes - einstein relation in these temperature regimes .",
    "the phenomena becomes even more prominent with increasing pinning concentration and the stokes - einstein parameter becomes strongly temperature dependent and the temperature at which this violation happens seems to also increase with increasing pinning concentration as shown in fig.[seviolation ] . thus pinning",
    "a set of randomly chosen particles in their equilibrium positions will be an excellent model system to understand breakdown of stokes - einstein relation in supercooled liquids .",
    "+ 0.1 cm + 0.5 cm    in the same context it is important to discuss the fractional stokes - einstein relation and how the exponent depends on the pinning density . in fig.[fractionalse ] , we have plotted @xmath6 vs @xmath9 in log - log plot for different pinning density . as in @xcite , we have found that at higher temperatures @xmath67 , but as one goes to lower temperature , this relation breaks down and one gets @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "the value of the fractional stokes - einstein exponent @xmath14 increases continuously with increasing pinning density as shown in lower panel of fig.[fractionalse ] .",
    "these observations also give us an opportunity to gain better understanding of the phenomena without much computational difficulty .",
    "for the rest of the paper we will discuss about the correlation between different dynamical measures of dynamic heterogeneity and their correlation with the breakdown of stokes - einstein relation .",
    "+ 0.3 cm    as discussed before many phenomenological theories suggest stokes - einstein breakdown to be due to the presence of dynamic heterogeneity in the system at the supercooled temperature regime @xcite and indeed some correlation was also found in @xcite .",
    "it was found that peak height of @xmath70 starts to grow rapidly at a temperature very close to the temperature where stokes - einstein breakdown seems to happen for different model system in different dimensions . to see whether similar correlation exists here for the pinned system",
    ", we have calculated the four - point susceptibility as shown in different panels of fig.[x4vst ] .",
    "one can see the usual temperature dependence of @xmath56 for different pinning density @xmath29 .",
    "it is interesting to note that actual peak height of @xmath56 decreases with increasing pinning density as can be seen in top panel of fig.[x4pvstandrho ] , where temperature dependence of @xmath71 is plotted for different pinning density and one sees that @xmath71 decrease with increasing pinning density .",
    "it becomes much clearer when @xmath71 is plotted as a function of pinning density for different temperature as shown in the bottom panel of the same figure .",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath71 completely fails to capture stokes - einstein breakdown for these model system .",
    "actually it shows anti - correlation .",
    "+ 0.1 cm + 0.5 cm    next we check whether the exponent @xmath3 , related to stretched exponential decay of two - point correlation function is correlated with the stokes - einstein breakdown as found in @xcite .",
    "we followed the similar fitting procedure as described in @xcite , to get the exponent @xmath3 by fitting the @xmath72 data to the following fitting function @xmath73 } + b \\exp{\\left[-(\\frac{t}{\\tau_\\alpha})^{\\beta}\\right ] } \\label{qtfitfn}\\ ] ]    + 0.1 cm    although it is a non - linear fitting with @xmath74 parameters , with good initial choice of the parameters the fitting converges to the right solution very quickly without any problem as can be seen in fig.[qtfitting ] .",
    "the quality of the fit gives us the confidence on the reliability of the extracted values of the exponent @xmath3 .",
    "+ 0.1 cm    in fig.[betavst ] , we have shown the stretched exponent @xmath3 as a function of temperature for different pinning density and one can clearly see that @xmath3 becomes smaller and smaller with increasing pinning density . in @xcite , it was shown that @xmath3 becomes closer to one as one increases dimensions of the system from @xmath75 to @xmath76 and stokes - einstein breakdown also becomes less prominent with increasing dimensionality .",
    "thus it seems stretched exponent @xmath3 to be an excellent identifier of the stokes - einstein breakdown even for the pinned systems .",
    "now if we assume that stretched exponential relaxation is related to hierarchical relaxation processes , then one can write @xmath77 where @xmath3 will be related to the relative variance of the distribution and smaller @xmath3 will corresponds to larger relative width of the distribution . to ascertain that we have discretized the above equation to calculate the distribution @xmath78 by minimizing @xmath79 , @xmath80 ^ 2 \\label{chisq}\\ ] ]    + 0.1 cm + 0.3 cm    where @xmath81 is the number of time points @xmath82 , where two point - correlation function @xmath72 is obtained from simulations and @xmath83 is the number of discretized @xmath84 values ( @xmath85 ) where we want to find out the probability density @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 , is the elementary discretization step size .",
    "one crucial transformation which is required to get the required convergence of the @xmath79 minimization is to do the following variable change , @xmath88 and then minimize with respect to the new variable @xmath89 .",
    "this ensures the positivity of the probability @xcite . as shown in top panel of fig.[ptau ] , the convergence is quite good and one can get very reliable estimate of the underlying probability distribution of the relaxation time .",
    "we have calculated the probability for all the different temperatures at different pinning density but showing the results for three different pinning concentrations at temperatures where @xmath9 are comparable to each other .",
    "the results clearly show that indeed the normalize distribution tends to have fatter tail in the larger @xmath84 values with increasing pinning density .",
    "the nice bi - modality of the distribution is also interesting and will discuss this issue in the context of distribution of diffusion constants .",
    "still now we have shown that peak height of @xmath56 does not seem to capture the increasing degree of stokes - einstein violation in the pinned system , whereas stretched exponent @xmath3 and the associated distribution of relaxation time seem to correlate very well .",
    "next we will quantify the dynamic heterogeneity by identifying `` slow '' and `` fast '' particles over the @xmath4-relaxation time scale as done in @xcite and show the results on the clustering properties of these slow particles in the system to elucidate their role in breakdown of stokes - einstein relation .",
    "+ 0.5 cm    we will first briefly discuss the method used to obtain the distribution of diffusion constants from the van hove correlation function using lucy iteration @xcite .",
    "this method is also recently used in @xcite for the diffusion processes in biological systems .",
    "we start with the following assumption : that particles displacements are mainly caused by diffusion processes . due to dynamic heterogeneity in the system at least in the supercooled temperature regime",
    "it is not very surprising to expect that there will be a distribution of local diffusivity @xmath90",
    ". then we can express van hove correlation function calculated at @xmath4-relaxation timescale , @xmath91 in terms of @xmath90 as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the upper limit of diffusion constant and will be equal to diffusivity for a free diffusion .",
    "now given the @xmath91 we calculate the distribution of diffusivity @xmath90 following @xcite as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the estimate of @xmath90 in the @xmath97 iteration with @xmath98 and @xmath99 similarly @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "the choice of @xmath102 as our variable is due to the fact that @xmath6 changes by several orders of magnitude in the studied temperature range whereas @xmath103 changes relatively modestly with decreasing temperature and it will be easier to compare the distribution obtained for different temperatures ( please see @xcite for further details ) .    in fig.[pd ]",
    ", we have shown the obtained distribution of diffusion constants for different pinning concentrations .",
    "for the unpinned case the distribution is very nicely bimodal below some temperatures , clearly telling us that one can easily identify a set of `` slow '' and `` fast '' moving particles over @xmath4-relaxation time scale .",
    "notice that at much larger time than @xmath9 the dynamic heterogeneity will be averaged out and one expects the corresponding van hove function to become gaussian .",
    "thus at longer timescale the distribution will also loose its bimodality , but as already shown in @xcite , the bimodal feature remains intact even for timescale which are at least couple of time larger than the @xmath4- relaxation timescale .",
    "thus we believe that the results reported here to be qualitatively valid even for timescale larger than the typical relaxation time .",
    "+ 0.5 cm    the cutoff we chose to define such set of particles is the minimum of the two peaks of the bimodal distribution . for system with pinning ,",
    "the peak associated with the `` slow '' particles in the distribution splits into two peaks .",
    "this can be understood as follows : with increasing pinning density the difference in the diffusion constants between `` slow '' and `` fast '' particles will increase strongly and there will be a set of particles who reside on the boundary of `` slow '' moving and `` fast '' moving particles with intermediate diffusion constants .",
    "the split of the first peak in @xmath104 we believe is due to these set of particles which becomes prominent with increasing difference in diffusivity between `` slow '' and `` fast '' particles . in our studies",
    "we have considered the particles with these intermediate diffusion constants to be part of the `` slow '' particles . as mentioned before",
    ", @xmath78 also shows bimodality and it will be interesting to see whether different peaks in that distribution actually correspond to relaxation of `` slow '' or `` fast '' moving particles .    next we have defined a cutoff distance @xmath105 at the minimum of the two peaks of the @xmath104 distribution for a given temperature and pinning density . with this definition",
    "we define a particles `` slow '' if it has not moved a distance bigger than the critical distance over @xmath9 timescale and the others who have move beyond are termed as `` fast '' particles . in fig.[distcluster ] , we have plotted the distribution of cluster size for `` slow '' moving particles for different temperature at pinning concentration @xmath106 .",
    "one can see the appearance of power law distribution at lower temperatures with exponent @xmath107 . at still",
    "further lower temperatures one can see an appearance of a small hump at larger cluster size , indicating the existence of system spanning cluster . motivated by this observation",
    "we then have tried to study a possible underlying percolation transition associated with the clusters of `` slow '' moving particles .",
    "+ 0.5 cm    in fig.[pcvst ] , we have plotted the probability of finding a system spanning cluster , @xmath108 as a function of temperature for different pining concentration .",
    "it is clear that probability of finding system spanning cluster seems to grow sharply after a particular critical temperature and this temperature also shifts to higher values with increasing pinning concentration .",
    "thus we have a clear one to one correspondence between onset of stokes - einstein violation and the appearance of system spanning cluster . to establish a clear percolation transition one needs to perform a detailed finite size scaling analysis which we have not yet performed here in this study due to large computational requirements .",
    "we also have studied the phenomena for another system size with @xmath23 particles . for percolation transition one",
    "expects to have a somewhat smoother increase of probability of finding system spanning cluster with decreasing temperature due to finite size effects . in fig.[fss ] , we have plotted @xmath108 as a function of temperature for two different system sizes @xmath23 and @xmath24 for different pinning concentrations .",
    "one can clearly see that @xmath108 increases somewhat less sharply with decreasing temperature for smaller system sizes . thus confirming a possible underlying percolation transition @xcite associated with stokes - einstein violation",
    ". it will be interesting to perform a detailed finite size scaling analysis to calculate the exponents related to this transition and its connection to slowing down in dynamics in supercooled liquids .",
    "next we have calculated the mean cluster size as a function of temperature for different pinning concentrations as another indicator of dynamic heterogeneity . as shown in fig.[meancluster ] , the growth of the mean cluster size is very dramatic and the growth is even more dramatic for higher pinning concentrations , suggesting that indeed dynamic heterogeneity increases with increasing pinning concentration .    -0.5",
    "cm    finally to understand the origin of fractional stokes - einstein exponent , @xmath14 , we have calculated the fractal dimensions of these spanning cluster as shown in fig.[dfvst ] .",
    "we have used sandbox method for determining the fractal dimension of these percolating clusters @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the clusters are not compact and the fractal dimensions are in the range @xmath109 $ ] at different temperatures and pinning concentrations .",
    "the important thing to notice is that the fractal dimension is systematically larger for the system with increasing pinning concentrations .",
    "thus it seems there is a positive correlation between fractal dimensions of the system spanning cluster and the fractional stokes - einstein exponent .",
    "right now we do not have a very clear understanding about this correlation but the following simple arguments seem to suggest such correlation . at higher temperatures @xmath110 and then at lower temperatures @xmath111 with @xmath112 , which implies that @xmath9 increases much faster than the rate at which @xmath6 decreases . this difference in change of @xmath9 and @xmath6 with decreasing temperature",
    "will be much more prominent if the cluster forms by the `` slow '' moving particles become more compact .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath9 is mainly determined by the relaxation of the `` slow '' particles and breaking a compact `` slow '' cluster will be more difficult than breaking a less compact cluster . on the other hand , @xmath6 is predominantly determined by the diffusion constants of the `` fast '' moving particles",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether such an argument works for system where breaking `` slow '' particles cluster is even more difficult due to bond formation , for example in the `` patchy '' colloidal system .",
    "to conclude we have performed extensive computer simulations of a model two dimensional glass forming liquids to understand the breakdown of stokes - einstein relation in these systems .",
    "we found that if one randomly pins some fraction of particles in the system in their equilibrium positions then degree of stokes - einstein violation increases dramatically .",
    "this enabled us to study stokes - einstein violation in supercooled liquids in a systematic manner and also provided us with a model system where exponent related to fractional stokes - einstein relation can be tuned very precisely .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    * breakdown of stokes - einstein relation in supercooled liquids get enhanced with randomly pinning some faction of particles in the system and exponent associated with fractional stokes - einstein relation also systematically increases with increasing pinning concentration . *",
    "peak height of @xmath56 does not seem to be correlated with stokes - einstein breakdown in disagreement with previously reported results . *",
    "the exponent @xmath3 related to stretched exponential decay of the two point density - density correlation function clearly shows strong correlation with the stokes - einstein breakdown in complete agreement with previous studies . *",
    "appropriately defined `` slow '' moving particles over @xmath4-relaxation timescale seem to form clusters with decreasing temperature and at round the temperature where stokes - einstein relation starts to violate , the cluster of `` slow '' moving particles percolates the whole system size .",
    "this indicates a possible deep connection between percolation transition of the `` slow '' particles and stokes - einstein breakdown .",
    "* mean cluster sizes of `` slow '' particles in the system grows with decreasing temperature and the growth is much stronger for system with larger pinning concentration . *",
    "the clusters of `` slow '' particles are fractal like objects with fractal dimensions @xmath113 in the range @xmath114 to @xmath115 and fractal dimension increases systematically with increasing pinning concentration .",
    "thus there is a positive correlation between fractal dimensions of these clusters with the exponent related to fractional stokes - einstein relation",
    ". it will be nice to further understand this correlation in other model glass forming liquids too .",
    "the results reported in this study is only for a model two dimensional system , so it will be interesting to see whether these results hold for three dimensional model system also .",
    "it is important to mention here that there are recent studies which seem to suggest a qualitative difference in glass transition in two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "although we do nt expect the results reported here to be qualitatively very different even for three dimensional systems but a detailed study is certainly necessary .",

    "<S> breakdown of stokes - einstein relation in supercooled liquids is believed to be one of the hallmarks of glass transition . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomena is studied in depth over many years to understand the microscopic mechanism without much success . </S>",
    "<S> recently it was found that violation of stokes - einstein relation in supercooled liquids can be tuned very systematically by pinning randomly a set of particles in their equilibrium positions . this observation suggested a possible framework where breakdown of stokes - einstein relation in the dynamics of supercooled liquids can be studied with precise control . </S>",
    "<S> we have done extensive molecular dynamics simulations to understand this phenomena by analyzing the structure of appropriately defined set of dynamically slow and fast particles clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the stokes - einstein breakdown actually become predominant once the cluster formed by the slow particles percolate the entire system size . </S>",
    "<S> finally we proposed a possible close connection between fractal dimensions of these clusters and the exponents associated with the fractional stokes - einstein relation . </S>"
