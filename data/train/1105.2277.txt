    "pseudogap or partial gap in the electronic structure , affecting some regions of the fermi surface while leaving other unaffected , is one of the key signatures of the underdoped cuprates @xcite .",
    "it is revealed through anomalous behaviors of the temperature - dependent resistivity , magnetization , nmr knight shift and relaxation rate , as well as in spectroscopic data @xcite .",
    "pseudogap shows the same @xmath7-space distribution as the superconducting gap @xcite and is universally observed in hole- and electron- doped cuprates in the underdoped regime .",
    "features consistent with pseudogap are also clearly found in hole doped feas - based materials ( see @xcite for a review ) . because the parent compounds of iron pnictides are metals ,",
    "the pseudogap here is believed to arise from nesting instability @xcite .    in ba(fe@xmath1t@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 ( bat122 in the following)substitution of the transition metals into fe position",
    "leads to electron doping .",
    "nmr studies suggest the existence of a pseudogap in baco122 over the broad doping range including full domain of superconductivity , from magnetically ordered parent compound to non - superconducting metal .",
    "existence of pseudogap leads to a temperature - dependent knight shift @xmath8 , well described by a formula @xmath9 , where the first term describes contribution of the metallic portion of the fermi surface and the second activated term allows determination of the @xmath10 as 560  k @xmath11150  k at optimal doping @xcite . at temperatures",
    "@xmath12 this leads to temperature independent knight shift and a crossover to metallic temperature dependence in the inter - plane resistivity @xcite .",
    "no discernible features are observed in the in - plane resistivity @xcite , which suggests that the areas of the fermi surface affected by pseudo - gap are rather small and belong to the most warped parts of the fermi surface , contributing mostly to inter - plane transport .    in this article",
    "we report a systematic study of the evolution of the inter - plane resistivity with doping by other transition metals inducing superconductivity in ba122 , @xmath4= rh , ni , pd .",
    "we show that similar anomalies are observed in the temperature dependent inter - plane resistivity for all types of substitution , with the characteristic temperature of resistive crossover being suppressed with doping .",
    "the rate of @xmath5 suppression with @xmath13 is however notably higher in ni and pd doped compositions , even with correction for a difference in number of added electrons .",
    "the doping - dependence of the pseudogap feature suggests that it represents an independent energy scale in the problem , different from that of structural / magnetic transition and superconductivity .",
    "single crystals of bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 doped with ni , pd and rh were grown as described in detail in previous communications @xcite .",
    "crystals were thick platelets with large faces corresponding to the tetragonal ( 001 ) plane .",
    "the actual content of transition metals , @xmath13 , was determined with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy ( wds ) electron probe microanalysis and is used in the following .",
    "we used two - probe resistivity measurements , as justified by ultralow contact resistance of sn - soldered contacts @xcite .",
    "the details of sample preparation , sample screening and selection are identical to those used in our studies of @xmath14-axis resistivity in co - doped material @xcite .",
    "the absolute values of the inter - plane resistivity at room temperature for most compositions stays in the range 1 to 1.5 m@xmath15 cm , with doping it decreases to approximately 0.5 m@xmath15 cm . for several @xmath13 compositions we were not able to find crystals with resistivity values lower than 2   m@xmath15 cm , despite the facts that ( 1 ) the evolution of the temperature - dependent resistivity for these samples followed the general trend , ( 2 ) close in @xmath13 compositions show usual resistivity values .",
    "this limits the accuracy of the absolute @xmath6 value determination by approximately a factor of two .",
    "in the top panel of fig .  [ rh ] we plot inter - plane resistivity of ba(fe@xmath1rh@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 , using normalized scale @xmath16 . to avoid overlapping ,",
    "the curves are offset progressively upwards for higher dopings .",
    "the data for parent compound are reproduced from ref .  .",
    "several features of the temperature dependence are essentially the same as observed in compositions with co doping @xcite . for low doping @xmath17=0.012 , @xmath18 shows resistivity increase on cooling for @xmath19 ( marked with an arrow ) , which is the pseudogap feature in all compositions studied . on reaching a temperature of structural / magnetic transition @xmath20 ,",
    "resistivity dives down , and decreases monotonically all the way to base temperature , showing some signatures of filamentary superconductivity at about 20  k due to strain @xcite .",
    "this decrease of resistivity below @xmath20 is similarly observed in lightly co doped composition @xmath21= 0.012 @xcite . for higher dopings @xmath17=0.026 and @xmath17=0.39 resistivity shows increase below @xmath20 and drop to zero below superconducting @xmath22 , in complete accord to the behavior found in co - doped compositions . finally , for compositions in which structural / magnetic transition is completely suppressed , @xmath23 , position of the resistivity maximum shifts down in temperature and for an ultimate doping @xmath24= 0.171 , when superconductivity is completely suppressed , the resistivity shows shallow minimum , marked with cross arrow in fig .
