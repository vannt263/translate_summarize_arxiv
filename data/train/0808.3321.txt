    "the cw method , which is very efficient for measurement of equal time green functions , has to be modified to include simultaneous updates of bosons and fermions to allow the study of mixtures @xcite .",
    "however , this algorithm sometimes becomes inefficient for large system sizes ( @xmath22 ) especially failing to sample different winding numbers which is necessary to calculate the superfluid density @xcite . in those cases we used the dsfg which explores a much larger configuration space and",
    "thus allows more efficient fluctuations of the winding number and the measure of @xmath23 .",
    "the two algorithms gave results in agreement for other quantities in the range of sizes we used .",
    "this model was widely studied in the special case where the total number of particles equals the number of sites @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of bosons ( fermions).@xcite for large enough values of the repulsions , double occupancy of sites is forbidden and one can describe the system in terms of a pseudo spin-1/2 @xmath26 .",

    "however , for a supersolid phase to appear , the interactions must be chosen so that the added bosons do not introduce defects in the previous solid order : they must preferentially come on sites already occupied by bosons .",

    "there is always an algebraic decay characteristic of a superfluid in one dimension , except at double half - filling in the solid phase.[green],width=321 ]    these results lead to the conclusion that a supersolid phase can only be found for @xmath42 , where no defects are introduced in the solid order . doping the bosons above half - filling",

    "figures [ fss ] and [ sfdens ] show that , for this case , the structure factor goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit while the superfluid density remains finite .",

    "[ fss ] ) @xmath33 extrapolates to a finite value as @xmath14 increases .",

    "obtaining precise values for @xmath58 is difficult but , on the other hand , the green function , @xmath15 , is measured with very good statistical accuracy and can , therefore , also be used to characterize the nature of the phase coherence .",
    "figure [ fsg ] shows that @xmath15 exhibits power law decay for all the sizes and values of the fermion hopping parameter we have studied ( for @xmath56 ) , confirming the existence of a quasi condensate which leads to a superfluid behavior in the presence of long range density order for the fermions .",
    "this indicates the presence of a supersolid phase in this system for @xmath55 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath56 .     in the case where the system is doped above half - filling .",

    "@xmath64 , and boson - hole pairs @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66    figure [ otherg ] shows that these green functions have algebraic decay in the candidate supersolid phase .",
    "the dominant correlations are those of individual bosons , they have the slowest decay and the largest values .",
    "however , a description only in terms of bosons does not fully characterize this phase ; we see that individual fermion , boson - hole and boson - fermion pairs also have algebraic phase correlations and are also relevant degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "the boson - hole pairs have much stronger phase correlations than the boson - fermion pairs .",
    "this is to be expected since anticorrelated movement of bosons and fermions is a generic phenomenon in such mixtures with repulsive interactions @xcite .    in a similar way to the case above half - filling",
    ", we performed finite size scaling analysis when the system is doped below half - filling ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "we studied a case where the value of @xmath8 is quite large ( @xmath61 ) since we observed in the previous case that it improves the structure factor .",
    "we find that , as for the case above half filling , the structure factor and the superfluid density both go to a finite value in the large @xmath14 limit and that a supersolid phase is , therefore , thermodynamically stable ( see fig .",
    "[ belowhf ] ) .",
    "this behavior is different from what happens in the bosonic case with near neighbor interactions where , doping below half filling leads to a superfluid with soliton - like quasiparticles .",
    "in this paper we have studied , using exact qmc simulations , the formation of supersolid phases in the ground state of bose - fermi mixtures on optical lattices . at double half filling , @xmath67 , and for sufficiently large @xmath68 , the system exhibits long range density order as exposed by @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite inspired by the behavior of the extended bosonic hubbard model , which exhibits a supersolid phase above half filling when the near neighbor repulsion is large enough compared to the contact term ,  @xcite , we found that , similarly , when @xmath69 and the system is doped by adding bosons , the system enters a supersolid phase .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that this phase is a collective bose - fermi phase : the various green functions ( boson - boson , fermion - fermion and boson - fermion ) we have presented demonstrate this clearly .",
    "surprisingly , we have also found that upon doping the system below half filling for the bosons , we also obtain a stable supersolid phase .",
    "this is different from the behavior of the purely bosonic system .",
