    "in this paper , inspired by hamilton s work on the ricci flow @xcite that culminated in perelman s proof of thurston s geometrization conjecture and the longstanding poincar conjecture @xcite , we introduce a new flow , based on the conformally invariant cotton tensor .",
    "this flow is exclusive to three dimensions and its fixed points are the conformally flat metrics .    historically , the ricci flow equations seem to have first arisen in a work by friedan @xcite that deals with the renormalization group ( rg ) flow in a 2-dimensional nonlinear sigma model . just like any other coupling in quantum field theories , the riemannian metric , considered as a coupling ` constant ' between the sigma model fields defined on a manifold @xmath0",
    ", runs as the energy scale changes : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a constant uniquely fixed by the 1-loop result , and @xmath3 is a dimensionful parameter ( such as the tension ) . of course , in general , the beta function for the rg flow of the metric will have infinitely many terms , including the ricci tensor .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , the 2-loop result with a riemann - square correction is given .",
    "in string theory , which is again a two dimensional sigma model with additional fields , gravitation ( including general relativity as the lowest order approximation ) that governs the dynamics of the target space , is derived by the requirement that the beta function vanishes as a result of weyl invariance on the worldsheet . since a non - anomalous weyl symmetry is crucial for string theory , in the physics literature",
    ", it is common practice to set @xmath4 and consequently , end up not with a flow , but with a usual gravity theory ( containing perhaps some additional fields and higher curvature terms ) .",
    "on the other hand , hamilton @xcite _ introduced _ the ricci flow as a means to deform a given metric on a manifold and developed a programme aiming to prove the poincar conjecture .",
    "in particular , he classified closed 3-manifolds of positive ricci curvature",
    ".    obviously , one could introduce many different flows , or depending on one s point of view , derive flows that come from the beta functions of two dimensional non - linear sigma models . as examples of the former ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for an example of the latter , see @xcite where a string inspired flow with scalar , maxwell and anti - symmetric tensor fields is studied .",
    "our motivation was to find a flow whose critical points are the conformally flat spaces , and this is achieved in three dimensions with a unique 2-tensor called the cotton tensor .",
    "we study the behaviour of the nine homogeneous geometries under this flow in detail .",
    "four of these are fixed points of our flow .",
    "[ we remark that the eight geometries appearing in thurston s geometrization conjecture are maximally symmetric ; viewed in this way , two of the nine ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) collapse to the same maximally symmetric geometry . ]    interesting physics could come out of the ricci flow or other flows such as the one we introduce here , especially in euclidean quantum gravity defined by the path integral .",
    "this is somewhat an unexplored territory .",
    "yet , we can point out several works in this direction : in @xcite , the ricci flow is applied to four dimensional black hole physics as a means to understand the phase structure of this theory in euclidean space .",
    "the ricci flow is also used @xcite to find inequalities in general relativity regarding the evolution of the area of a surface and the enclosed hawking mass .",
    "see @xcite for a compilation of possible applications of the ricci flow in physics .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the cotton flow and show how some geometric quantities evolve accordingly . in section 3 ,",
    "we give an entropy functional which is non - decreasing under the cotton flow .",
    "this also gives us a gradient formulation of the cotton flow . in section 4",
    ", we show that the cotton flow is in a certain sense orthogonal to the yamabe flow .",
    "section 5 is the bulk of our paper where we study the evolution of homogeneous spaces under the cotton flow both numerically and analytically . in the conclusion ,",
    "we summarize our results and mention some topics for further study . details of the computations regarding the homogeneous geometries are given in the appendices .",
    "in dimensions greater than or equal to 4 , the weyl tensor determines whether or not a given manifold is locally conformally flat . in 3-dimensions",
    ", the weyl tensor vanishes identically , and the role of the weyl tensor is played by the cotton tensor @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a tensor density , in an orthonormal frame @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the ricci tensor , and @xmath11 the curvature scalar .",
    "[ note that the cotton tensor is also referred to as the ` cotton - york tensor ' since york reintroduced @xcite and used it extensively in the initial value formulation of general relativity . ] here and throughout , the signature of the space will be @xmath12 , the indices will range from @xmath13 , and the sign convention for the riemann tensor will follow from @xmath14v_{k}=r_{ijk}\\,^{l}v_{l}$ ] .",
    "the tensor @xmath15 is covariantly conserved , symmetric and traceless ( see @xcite , where the cotton tensor was used to introduce the `` topologically massive gravity '' ) . the symmetry can be directly seen from the following representation of @xmath15 : @xmath16 the tensor @xmath17 is conformally invariant with weight @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth @xmath19-manifold with a positive definite metric @xmath20 .",
    "we will consider the flow defined by the equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a positive constant ( note that @xmath23 is not one of the coordinates of the manifold ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we may scale @xmath23 to set @xmath24 .",
    "the reason for taking @xmath25 is to make homogeneous metrics on the 3-sphere converge to the round sphere rather than diverge from it . since the right hand side is traceless , @xmath26 is independent of @xmath23 although it could depend on the coordinates .",
    "in contrast , the ricci tensor is not traceless in general , so a normalization factor is necessary for the ricci flow ( [ ricciflow ] ) in order for the volume density or volume to be preserved .    assuming that @xmath20 flows under the evolution equation ( [ cottonflow ] )",
    ", one can compute how some other geometric quantities evolve : @xmath27 where the usual shorthand notation for symmetrization is used : @xmath28 .",
    "the cotton flow equations form a system of third order , nonlinear partial differential equations . about a flat background",
    ", the linearization of the system , setting @xmath29 , gives @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes the laplacian in flat space .",
    "the @xmath33 terms can be viewed as coming from a diffeomorphism of the manifold . unlike the ricci flow case , whose linearized",
    "form is of heat equation type in the highest order after deturck s modification by a diffeomorphism @xcite , our equation is of third order . in this respect",
    ", it seems impossible to apply results from elliptic operator theory directly for the short time existence problem .",
    "understanding the conditions for the initial metric under which the equations are locally well - posed seems to be a delicate problem , which will not be studied in this paper .",
    "in order to show that the ricci flow can be regarded as a gradient flow , perelman @xcite defined an _",
    "entropy functional _",
    "@xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the metric , and @xmath36 is a scalar field .",
    "he proved that if @xmath37 and @xmath35 obeys the ricci flow equations , then @xmath38 is a ( non - strictly ) increasing functional . for the cotton flow ,",
    "an analogous functional is the well known gravitational chern - simons action @xcite : @xmath39 note the absence of an extra scalar field , in contrast to the case of the ricci flow .",
    "the functional @xmath38 is conformally invariant , and up to a boundary term , diffeomorphism invariant . defining @xmath40 , after a straightforward but lengthy computation , one obtains @xmath41 the choice @xmath42 gives the steepest descent , and leads to the cotton flow @xmath43 .",
    "the functional @xmath44 is increasing if @xmath35 evolves under the cotton flow .",
    "the cotton entropy @xmath44 is constant if and only if @xmath45 is identically zero , which means that @xmath0 is locally conformally flat at all points .",
    "one can define various flows in the space of metrics .",
    "one of these is the yamabe flow defined by the equation @xcite @xmath46 under this flow , the conformal class of a metric does not change .",
    "the yamabe flow was introduced in order to solve yamabe s conjecture @xcite , which states that any metric is conformally equivalent to a metric with constant scalar curvature .",
    "the cotton flow has a somewhat complementary behaviour since by definition it changes the conformal class unless the metric is conformally flat .",
    "we will now make this behaviour precise in a sense , by computing the commutator of the vector fields for these two flows .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath47 denote , respectively , the parameters for the cotton and the yamabe flows .",
    "then @xmath48 g_{ij } = \\partial_{t } \\partial_{\\tau } g_{ij }   - \\partial_{\\tau } \\partial_{t } g_{ij } = - \\partial_{t } ( \\mathcal{r}g_{ij } ) - \\partial_{\\tau } c_{ij}.\\ ] ] since @xmath17 is conformally invariant , @xmath49 . from here",
    ", it follows that @xmath50 .",
    "using the third equality of ( [ quantities ] ) , one gets @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , @xmath52g_{ij}=r^{kl}c_{kl}g_{ij}.\\ ] ] since the result is proportional to the metric , the commutator of the two flows gives another flow preserving the conformal class , just like the yamabe flow .",
    "in this section , we will be interested in studying the behaviour of the cotton flow on homogeneous three manifolds .",
    "there are nine such homogeneous geometries : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath5 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath6 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "as explained in the introduction , they give rise to the eight maximally symmetric geometries which are the basic building blocks that take the stage in thurston s geometrization conjecture for three manifolds @xcite .",
    "this conjecture , which includes the poincar conjecture as a special case , was settled by perelman s work @xcite .    the first six of these nine geometries can be obtained by the following construction : suppose that @xmath60 is a @xmath19-dimensional , unimodular , simply connected lie group , and that @xmath35 is a left - invariant metric on @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact 3-manifold obtained as the quotient of @xmath60 with respect to a discrete subgroup .",
    "the analysis of the ricci flow on these manifolds was carried out in detail in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "[ a similar analysis for cross curvature flow was carried out in @xcite .",
    "] as in the case of the ricci flow , the cotton flow equations on a homogeneous 3-manifold reduce to a set of three coupled ordinary , nonlinear , autonomous differential equations .",
    "we now proceed to find this system of differential equations . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that there exists an orthogonal left - invariant frame @xmath61 on @xmath60 such that @xmath62=2\\nu f_{3}$ ] , @xmath63=2\\lambda f_{1}$ ] , @xmath64=2\\mu f_{2}$ ] where @xmath65 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath66 be the dual basis of 1-forms to @xmath61 .",
    "in this basis , the metric @xmath35 takes the form @xmath67 defining @xmath68 we obtain an orthonormal coframe , with respect to which the metric takes the form @xmath69 .",
    "one has @xmath70 the cotton flow equations can be written as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the cotton @xmath73-form and @xmath74 denotes the hodge dual .",
    "since the cotton flow preserves the volume density , from now on we assume that @xmath75 .",
    "referring the reader to the appendix for the details of the computation , we state the equations which take the form @xmath76,\\nonumber\\\\",
    "\\frac{db}{dt}&=4b[-\\mu^{2}b^{2}(\\nu c+\\lambda a-2\\mu b)-(\\nu c+\\lambda a)(\\nu c-\\lambda a)^{2}],\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{dc}{dt}&=4c[-\\nu^{2}c^{2}(\\lambda a+\\mu b-2\\nu c)-(\\lambda a+\\mu b)(\\lambda a-\\mu b)^{2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the entropy functional @xmath38 defined in section [ entropy ] can be alternatively computed using @xmath77 which for our case yields @xmath78 * 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",
    "recall that by the result in section [ entropy ] , @xmath38 is a non - decreasing functional . [ the name `` entropy '' may be misleading since @xmath38 is not necessarily nonnegative .",
    "in fact , the maximum value of @xmath38 in the @xmath53 case below is @xmath80 .",
    "all that matters is that @xmath38 is non - decreasing . ]",
    "the following simpler functional , which was obtained by manipulating ( [ homogenousflow ] ) , also acts like an entropy in _",
    "certain _ cases , and will also be useful in what follows : @xmath81 note also that , using ( [ homogenousflow ] ) @xmath82      when we take @xmath83 , the lie group @xmath60 is isomorphic to @xmath53 , which is homeomorphic to @xmath84 as a topological manifold .",
    "the proof that the flow equations ( [ homogenousflow ] ) take any initial homogeneous metric to the round metric @xmath85 on @xmath84 is remarkably simple . since @xmath83",
    ", one has @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and in both cases equality occurs if and only if @xmath85 .",
    "this proves the claim .",
    "it seems impossible to find an exact analytical solution to this system .",
    "therefore we carry out an estimate analysis similar to that in @xcite . from ( [ homogenousflow ] ) , one gets @xmath88.\\ ] ] since the right hand side vanishes when @xmath89 , by the uniqueness of solutions , the ordering between @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and likewise the ordering of the three variables can not change during the flow .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath92 due to the symmetry of the equations .",
    "from the last equation of ( [ homogenousflow ] ) , it is clear that @xmath93 is not decreasing , so @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the initial value of @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , @xmath96\\nonumber\\\\ & \\leq -8(a - c)[2c^{3}+2c^{2}a+2ca^{2}+2a^{3}-a(a+c)^{2}-a^{3}]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\leq -24c_{0}^{3}(a - c).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we deduce that @xmath97 .",
    "since the difference between the greatest and smallest of @xmath98 decays at least at this rate to @xmath18 , @xmath99 also converges at least at this rate to @xmath100 .    linearizing the system around the fixed point @xmath101 after setting @xmath102 gives @xmath103 which is in accordance with the estimate above since @xmath104 .",
    "one can alternatively solve the equations numerically .",
    "starting from various initial values for @xmath105 , a sketch of the solution curves can be seen in figure 1 .",

    "one obtains @xmath125 from these two equations , one gets @xmath126 the function @xmath127 is an integrating factor for this equation .",
    "so , there is a second conserved quantity besides @xmath75 : @xmath128 where @xmath2 is a constant .",
    "since there are two conserved quantities and three variables , the phase space foliates into 1-dimensional leaves . from ( [ dogru ] )",
    ", we see that the ordering between the symmetric variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 does nt change during the flow . assume without loss of generality that @xmath109 .",
    "then , @xmath129 thus @xmath90 is decreasing , @xmath91 is increasing , and they are both bounded away from @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that the flow exists for all @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath130 is the initial value of @xmath91 , then since @xmath131 , from ( [ dogru ] ) one gets @xmath132 so , @xmath133 decays to @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , using the conserved quantities , the equations can be integrated . from ( [ conserved ] )",
    ", it follows that @xmath134 . using @xmath135 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath136 .",

    "the remaining metric functions follow easily as @xmath143 since @xmath144 , by ( [ conserved ] ) , the limiting value of @xmath93 as @xmath145 is @xmath146 . in the limit ,",
    "@xmath89 and the geometry becomes flat . even though we have analytically solved the equations , we also present some numerical solutions of the system for various initial conditions in figure 3",
    ".    the conserved quantity ( [ conserved ] ) can be , more invariantly , written in terms of the ricci tensor and the scalar curvature as @xmath147 to get a unitless quantity , one should divide this by @xmath148 , if the manifold is of finite volume .      when we take @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath123 , the group @xmath60 is isomorphic to the group of isometries of the minkowski plane .",
    "the equations ( [ homogenousflow ] ) take the form : @xmath151    the first two equations imply that @xmath90 is decreasing and @xmath91 is increasing .",

    "recalling @xmath75 , we see that @xmath90 also decays to @xmath18 like @xmath155 .",
    "all geometries in this class thus tend to a cigar degeneracy .",
    "again , the equations can be completely integrated to give @xmath156 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 is another constant .",
    "we present some numerical solutions of the system for various initial conditions in figure 4 .",
    "when we take @xmath149 , @xmath157 , @xmath60 is isomorphic to the heisenberg group .",
    "the flow equations @xmath158 can be easily integrated to yield @xmath159 therefore , @xmath160 whereas @xmath91 and @xmath93 diverge . in the terminology of @xcite , this degeneracy is called a `` pancake degeneracy '' .      in this case ,",
    "@xmath161 , the metric is flat and the flow equations are trivial .",
    "these cases do not arise from the construction that uses a @xmath19 dimensional lie group as described , however the metrics can be written explicitly for each case .",

    "we have not been able to find a non - trivial solution of this equation , or of the simpler gradient cotton soliton equation where @xmath172 .",

    "<S> using the conformally invariant cotton tensor , we define a geometric flow , the _ cotton flow _ , which is exclusive to three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this flow tends to evolve the initial metrics into conformally flat ones , and is somewhat orthogonal to the yamabe flow , the latter being a flow within a conformal class . </S>",
    "<S> we define an entropy functional , and study the flow of nine homogeneous spaces both numerically and analytically . in particular , we show that the arbitrarily deformed homogeneous 3-sphere flows into the round 3-sphere . </S>",
    "<S> two of the nine homogeneous geometries , which are degenerated by the ricci flow , are left intact by the cotton flow . </S>"
