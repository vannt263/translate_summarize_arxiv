    "cosmic rays have been originally discovered in 1912/13 by hess ( hess 1912 ) and kohlhrster ( kohlhrster 1913 ) and still today we have no certainty where they come from . their overall spectrum has been shown to be essentially a power - law with a bend down near @xmath0 ev , called the knee , and a turn towards a new flatter component near @xmath3 ev , called the ankle , with a final turn - off just around @xmath4 ev , summarized in ( gaisser & stanev 2008 ) .",
    "it is thought , that the component below about @xmath5 ev is galactic and the component above this energy is extragalactic , on the basis that particles above such an energy would be hard to contain and isotropize in the magnetic fields in the interstellar medium disk of the galaxy .",
    "different astrophysical scenarios have been proposed to explain the galactic and the extragalactic components of the cosmic radiation , see the overview ( stanev 2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "the basic paradigm for galactic cosmic rays has been acceleration in the shock waves caused by supernova explosions ( baade & zwicky 1934 ) . the process of acceleration is diffusive shock acceleration ( fermi 1949 ) and it is based on the compression experienced by particles that get reflected by magnetic irregularities from both sides of a shock in an ionized magnetic plasma ( drury 1983 ) .",
    "supernovae are exploding stars and they may explode either directly into the interstellar medium or into the stellar wind of the predecessor star ( woosley 2002 ) .",
    "lagage & cesarsky ( lagage & cesarsky 1983 ) showed that acceleration at the shocks caused explosions into the normal interstellar medium can not reach even the energies at the knee .",
    "heavy nuclei can be accelerated up to about @xmath6 ev in galactic sources , such as supernova explosions of massive stars which explode into their wind ( vlk & biermann 1988 ) , ob - star super - bubbles , gamma ray bursts ( dermer 2004 ) or micro - quasars , active accreting black holes in stellar binary systems .    for higher energies ( @xmath7 ev )",
    "extragalactic sources are the most accepted candidates .",
    "nearby active radio galaxies with black hole activity were first proposed by ginzburg & syrovatskii ( ginzburg & syrovatskii 1963 ) ( see also , e.g. , ( lovelace 1976 ) and ( biermann & strittmatter 1987 ) ) as possible sources .",
    "gamma ray bursts in other galaxies have also been suggested by waxman ( waxman 1995 ) and vietri ( vietri 1995 ) .",
    "the radio galaxy cen a is a prime example of a possible astrophysical source ( anchordoqui et al .",
    "the interaction of high energy particles with the microwave background limits the distance of the sources ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ; allard et al .",
    "2008 ; stanev 2010b ) . for protons the energy at which the all particle spectrum from many sources should turn off",
    "is estimated to be @xmath8 ev and for other chemical elements the energy turn off is lower ( allard et al .",
    "2008 ) . as the interaction distance becomes very large for particles with energy between @xmath5 and @xmath8 ev",
    ", the calculations predict a large number of extragalactic sources to contribute to the measured flux in this energy range .",
    "this is a primary prediction of these calculations .    of special interest",
    "is also the transition between galactic to extragalactic predominance which should happen in the energy range between @xmath9 to about @xmath6 ev .",
    "several experiments are presently taking data in this energy range : kascade - grande , telescope array , icetop and the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the transition is a very important feature because it is foreseen that breaks in the all particle spectrum and in the composition can reveal the details of the particle production mechanisms , the source population and propagation in the universe .",
    "there are a number of recent attempts to explain the cosmic ray spectrum in the transition range , e.g. by hillas ( hillas 2006 ) , and by berezinsky et al .",
    "( berezinsky et al . 2009 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the previously inaccessible continuous energy range above 10 pev extending to the highest energies measured . today",
    "it is possible to compare the predictions with high precision data over the entire energy range .",
    "therefore it becomes important to have predictive power , i.e. test quantitative hypotheses , which were developed long before much of the new data was known .",
    "we revisit here an idea originally proposed in 1993 ( biermann 1993 ; stanev et al . 1993 ) and we show how our galaxy and the radio galaxy cen a can describe the energy spectrum from 10 pev up to @xmath10 ev and describe the galactic to extragalactic transition at the same time .    in the following sections , we first go through the tests the 1993 original model has undergone to date as regards spectra , transport , secondaries , and composition",
    "; secondly we confirm the predictions of the original model with the newly available data beyond the knee energy , and finally we present the high energy model which describe the transition between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "in a series of papers started in 1993 ( biermann 1993 ; stanev et al . 1993 ; biermann 1994 ) a astrophysics scenario was proposed which emphasized the topology of the magnetic fields in the winds of exploding massive stars ( parker 1958 ) . in ( stanev et al .",
    "1993 ) , a comprehensive spectrum was predicted for six element groups separately : h , he , cno , ne - s , mn - cl , fe .",
    "the key points of this original model are : a ) the shock acceleration happens in a region , which is highly unstable and shows substructure , detectable in radio polarization observation of the shock region , also found in theoretical exploration ( e.g. ( bell & lucek 2001 ; caprioli et al .",
    "2010 ; bykov et al .",
    "therefore the particles go back and forth across the shock gaining momentum , while the scattering on both sides is dominated by the scale of these instabilities , which are assumed to be given by the limit allowed by the conservation laws in mass and momentum ; b ) there are cosmic ray particles which get accelerated by a shock in the interstellar medium , produced by the explosion of a relatively modest high mass star , or , alternatively , by a low mass supernova ia .",
    "this is most relevant for hydrogen and less for helium and heavier nuclei ; c ) heavy cosmic ray nuclei derive from very massive stars , which explode into stellar winds already depleted in hydrogen , and also in helium for the most massive stars .",
    "these explosions produce a two part spectrum with a bend that is proposed to explain the knee . in this scenario",
    "the knee is due to the finite containment of particles in the magnetic field of the predecessor stellar wind , which runs as @xmath11 in polar coordinates ( parker 1958 ) . towards the pole region",
    "only lower energies are possible and the knee energy itself is given by the space available in the polar region .",
    "there is a polar cap component of cosmic rays associated to the polar radial field with a flatter spectrum ; d ) diffusive leakage from the cosmic ray disk steepens all these spectra by 1/3 for the observer ; e ) very massive stars eject most of their zero - age mass before they explode and so form a very massive shell around their wind ( woosley 2002 ) .",
    "this wind - shell is the site of most interaction for the heavy nuclei component of cosmic rays . for stellar masses above about 25 solar masses in zero age main sequence mass ( biermann 1994 ) the magnetic irregularity spectrum is excited by the cosmic ray particles themselves .",
    "the spectral steepening due to the interactions is @xmath12 for the most massive star shells .",
    "the final spectrum is a composition of these components , see figure 1 of ref .",
    "( stanev et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the spectra predicted by these arguments match the data such as shown by the recent cream results ( wiebel - sooth et al .",
    "1998 ; biermann et al .",
    "this scenario has undergone detailed tests as regards propagation and interactions ( biermann 1994 ; biermann et al .",
    "2009 ) so as to describe both galactic propagation and the spectra of the spallated isotopes as well as the resulting positron spectra , the flatter cosmic ray positron and electron data , the wmap haze and the spectral behavior of its inverse compton emission , and the 511 kev emission from the galactic center region . new tracer results ( obermeier 2011 ) are also consistent in terms of a ) the low energy source spectrum , b ) the energy dependence of interaction , c ) a finite residual path - length at higher energy , and d ) a general upturn in the individual element spectra .",
    "the newest pamela results ( adriani 2011 ) are also consistent with the 1993 original model , in which hydrogen was the only element to have a strong ism - sn cosmic ray component , and so has a steeper spectrum than helium .",
    "this original model was proposed to explain the particles observed above @xmath13 ev per nuclear charge . here",
    "we first test the original model to the kascade data .",
    "the most accurate measurement of the energy spectrum in the knee energy range has been done by the kascade experiment ( kascade - grande coll .",
    "figure 1 shows for the first time the comparison of the original model to the measured data from kascade .",
    "kascade reconstructs the spectrum using two hadronic interaction programs ( qgsjet and sibyll ) in the analysis procedure . in the figure",
    "we show the data and the original model , and also include the ratio of the difference between original model and data divided by the experimental error .",
    "for the ratio shown we only use one of these interaction codes , as an example we use qgsjet .",
    "the figure shows good agreement between data and the original model to within the errors of the data .",
    "this confirms that the original model in its last remaining energy range , where it had not previously been tested for lack of good data .",
    "this is the first key result of this paper .",
    "one question , which invariably comes up is how this model deals with propagation and spallation . for this line of reasoning",
    "it is important to note two aspects : a ) plasma simulations , the solar wind data ( mattheaus & zhou 1989 ) , the interstellar medium data ( rickett 1977 , spangler & gwinn 1990 , goldstein et al .",
    "1995 ) as well as radio galaxy data ( biermann 1989 ) all are consistent with the interpretation that in an ionized magnetic plasma in near equipartition we have an approximate kolmogorov spectrum ( kolmogorov 1941 ) running without break from very large scales down to dissipation scale .",
    "b ) very massive stars eject most of the initial zero age main sequence mass in their powerful winds , which then builds up a correspondingly massive shell at the outer boundary of the wind .",
    "it is this massive shell the cosmic ray loaded supernova shock encounters and interacts with .",
    "all those cosmic ray particles accelerated by a supernova shock in the heavily enriched winds of wolf - rayet stars then excite magnetic irregularities , which can be described following bell ( 1978 ) ; it is these self - excited irregularities that describe the path of the cosmic ray particles through the massive shell .",
    "this gives ( biermann 1998 , biermann et al .",
    "2001 ) a boron / carbon ratio energy dependence of @xmath12 ; this was found to be consistent with data by ptuskin et al .",
    "( ptuskin et al . 1999 ) , who determined @xmath14 .",
    "since the straight - line path gives a minimum path , this model also gives a finite path - length of interaction at high energy , consistent with the new data as noted above .",
    "other tests are : the cosmic ray electron spectrum has been determined to be @xmath15 ( wiebel - sooth & biermann 1999 ) in the energy range up to a few tev , a spectrum which is dominated by losses ( kardashev 1962 ) . therefore the injection is with a spectrum flatter by unity .",
    "this has to be compared with the proton spectrum at a corresponding energy , which suggests @xmath16 near tev energies ( yoon et al .",
    "2011 ) ; this spectrum has been steepened by the energy dependence of the diffusion , and so the difference to the inferred cosmic ray electron spectrum gives this dependence as @xmath17 , consistent with @xmath18 as deduced from the kolmogorov assumption .",
    "another consistency check is the time scale inferred at the highest energies for leaking out of the kpc - thick cosmic ray disk near the sun ( biermann 1993 ) .",
    "since we have about @xmath19 yrs at gev energies for protons , we infer with the kolmogorov assumption a time scale of @xmath20 yrs at @xmath21 ev - adopting the point of view that the highest energies cosmic ray particles from the galaxy are fe ( stanev et al . 1993 ) at @xmath22 ev , matching in their scattering protons of @xmath21 ev ; however , this is not yet finally settled .",
    "this time scale is still significantly longer than the simple transit time across the thick disk of about @xmath23 yrs , so that the isotropy observed can be understood without already invoking the effect of the galactic wind . using three times the simple transit time as the minimum to give isotropy we can invert this line of reasoning and deduce a maximum energy dependence of the scattering of @xmath24 ( biermann 1993 ) , under the assumption again , that the entire energy range is covered by the same powerlaw .",
    "the wolf - rayet star model is able to also explain the positron spectra and positron production ( biermann et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) as noted above .",
    "based on the original model we propose here a high energy model to explain the cosmic ray data from 10 pev to 300 eev .",
    "we analyze the possibility that the _ very same spectrum _ proposed in 1993 however shifted in energy can explain all the data up to 300 eev including the knee region , the highest energy range ( @xmath7 ev ) and at the same time the middle energy range ( @xmath25 ev ) .",
    "the cosmic ray particles as seen in our galaxy were argued to provide the seed particles for further acceleration to ultra - high energy by a relativistic shock emanating from an active black hole in the nearby radio galaxy cen a ( gopal - krishna et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this idea is explored here beyond what has been proposed in ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2010 ) which demonstrated that cen a can provide a sufficient flux for the highest energy particles by working out the energetic particle flux traversed by a shock surface in the jet of the radio galaxy cen a with the one - step further acceleration in a relativistic shock as proposed by ( achterberg et al .",
    "they have used the spectral shape of the original model ( stanev et al .",
    "1993 ) to fit the pierre auger data , however the fit of the measured spectrum was not constrained by the low energy spectrum as proposed in the original model ( stanev et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the energy spectrum calculated here is simply a shift of the particle spectra proposed in the original model ( stanev et al .",
    "1993 ) for low energies to the highest energies preserving the relative abundances of the original model .",
    "this proposal is considerable stronger than the previous one presented in ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "the energy shift corresponds to a factor of 2800 within the limits of a one - step acceleration by a relativistic shock as proposed by ( achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ) . the original model ( stanev et al .",
    "1993 ) has a number of parameters , which were set in 1992 , see fig.6 in ( stanev et al.1993 ) .",
    "none of these parameters had to be changed significantly in the analysis presented here .",
    "finally , we can construct the energy spectrum of cosmic rays by adding the galactic component to the extragalactic component as shown in figure 1 . in this figure",
    "we show differential flux @xmath26 versus energy per particle as predicted by this analysis compared to the data from kascade ( kascade coll .",
    "2009 ) , kascade - grande ( kascade - grande coll .",
    "2010 ) and the pierre auger observatory ( pierre auger coll .",
    "we have shifted within the experimental uncertainties the kascade and kascade - grande flux down by 14% and the auger flux up by 14 % in order to match .",
    "we distinguish six groups , h , he , cno , ne - s , cl - mn , and fe .",
    "particles were subjected to the losses in the intergalactic radiation field ( allard et al .",
    "the numbers above the lines correspond to error estimations ( model - data)/(experimental error ) .",
    "we note the good agreement between data and model from below @xmath0 to @xmath27 ev .",
    "one extra assumption of the original model , namely the energy shift , allows a description of the energy spectrum above @xmath6 ev . below the critical energy for interactions with the microwave background",
    ", it has been expected that we would observe a very large number of sources , at large distances .",
    "however , no other source population is needed to describe the energy spectrum above @xmath28 ev .",
    "this is the second key new result of this paper .    to summarize ,",
    "a few results can be extracted from the proposal here : i ) there are no other sources necessary to provide extra flux in the energy range @xmath29 and @xmath27 ev , the second key result of this paper .",
    "a detailed analysis of radio galaxies ( caramete et al . 2011 ) shows that the next strongest radio galaxy to contribute is virgo a , as already predicted by ginzburg & syrovatskii ( 1963 ) .",
    "we estimate the maximum possible extra flux from other sources within this distance limit at 0.1 in the log in fig . 1 , so at 25 percent .",
    "we note that the self - consistent mhd - simulations for cosmological magnetic fields presented in ( ryu et al .",
    "2008 ) were carried out for protons and so , for heavy nuclei the magnetic horizon in intergalactic space is small , less than 100 mpc consistent with the measurements of the pierre auger observatory ( pierre auger coll .",
    "2010c ) which suggest a heavier composition for energies above @xmath30 ev . however , at yet lower energies the sum of the more distant sources might exceed the flux predicted from single sources such as cen a and vir a ; the magnetic scattering as predicted in ( ryu et al .",
    "2008 ) seems to prevent this at all energies above the transition to galactic cosmic rays ; ii ) the dip near @xmath31 ev is explained by the switch - over between the galactic cosmic rays and the extragalactic cosmic rays ( rachen et al .",
    "1993 ) ; iii ) the spectra of galactic cosmic rays beyond the knee are adequately modeled by our approach suggesting that the wolf - rayet star explosion model matches also the newest data beyond the knee ; iv ) there is no abrupt change in composition in the energy range from @xmath32 to @xmath5 ev ;    in order to describe the data ( pierre auger coll .",
    "2010a ) the high energy model presented here requires minimal interaction along the path between the radio galaxy cen a and us , and so indeed near isotropic scattering in the magnetic wind of our galaxy .",
    "the most recent results from the pierre auger observatory indicate an excess in the direction of cen a ( pierre auger coll .",
    "2010b ) which might corroborate the analysis presented here .",
    "the pierre auger observatory measures an isotropic sky for energies below @xmath8 ev and a weakly anisotropic sky above this energy ( pierre auger coll .",
    "the isotropy for energies below @xmath8 ev can be explained by a turbulent magnetic wind of our galaxy ( everett et al .",
    "this wind is thought to be driven by cosmic rays and hot gas , and so is itself unstable , giving irregular magnetic fields , akin to radiation driven winds of stars , ( cassinelli 1994 ; owocki 1990 ) .",
    "the magnetic fields in the wind are strong enough to isotropize incoming heavy element particles at very high energy and protons at lower energy .",
    "scattering in a magnetic wind with @xmath33 as a function of radial distance @xmath34 ( parker 1958 ) , is strongly enhanced due to the extra factor derived from integrating the lorentz force @xmath35 . the maximal energy for total bending",
    "can then be given by the magnetic field strength ( everett et al . 2008 ) at the base @xmath36 @xmath37gauss , the length scale at the base @xmath38 kpc , this logarithmic factor @xmath39 , and so is given by @xmath40 ev , where @xmath41 is the charge of the cosmic ray particle . since at those energies the data measured by the pierre auger observatory suggest that we actually have heavy nuclei , complete bending is assured .",
    "however , this would lead to a second problem , in that we then might find a complete shielding for any particles coming from outside , so this magnetic wind must also have considerable irregularities ; these irregularities in the wind need to be scale - free ( implying a saturated spectrum of irregularities , or inverse cascade @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the energy per wave number @xmath44 per volume ) , so as to avoid a characteristic energy , below which all particles are cut off ; or , if such an energy exists , it must be low enough not to disturb the spectral sum .",
    "the key point is that parker - winds ( parker 1958 ) are very effective at bending orbits .",
    "obviously , the scattering might not be complete , so that a small anisotropy is left possibly explaining the auger data clustering of events near the direction to the radio galaxy cen a.",
    "some predictions of the high energy model presented here are :    \\1 ) the calculations presented here predict the individual spectra for six element groups .",
    "the future data analysis from kascade - grande , icetop ( stanev 2009 ) , telescope array and the pierre auger observatory will be able to test this prediction ; 2 ) the trend to heavier nuclei from 2 to @xmath8 ev has been suggested by measurements of the depth of shower maximum done by the pierre auger observatory ( pierre auger coll .",
    "2010c ) ; we caution , that the interpretation of the data in terms of mass composition depends on hadronic interaction extrapolations ; 3 ) an isotropic background contribution of high energy cosmic rays from other more distant sources is compatible with our analysis up to 25 percent of the total flux .",
    "an important caveat of the analysis refers to gamma ray bursts .",
    "we could obtain similar results in describing the cosmic ray spectrum if instead of exploding wolf - rayet stars we would have used gamma ray bursts exploding into wolf - rayet star winds .",
    "this assumption allows that wolf - rayet star explosions might be due to the same mechanism as gamma ray bursts , but just completely stifled by the mass burden , possibly implying the magneto - rotational mechanism of bisnovatyi - kogan ( bisnovatyi - kogan 1970 ) .",
    "this would suggest that most galactic cosmic rays be attributed to gamma ray bursts ( dermer 2004 ) , and that the gamma ray burst rate is substantially higher than heretofore believed . the predictive power for the spectral indices and the energy scales",
    "is lost in this alternative .",
    "finally , we show how the high energy model proposed here could be falsified : a ) if all ultra high energy cosmic rays could be shown to be of one and only one chemical element , like all proton , or all iron ; b ) if neutrino or gamma ray data would unequivocally show that many nearby extragalactic sources contribute equivalently to the radio galaxy cen a. this could occur naturally in a gamma ray burst hypothesis , since many nearby starburst galaxies with high rates of star formation , supernova explosions , and gamma ray bursts could all contribute at comparable levels ( caramete et al .",
    "2011 ) ; c ) if it could be clearly shown that the turbulent magnetic wind of our galaxy does not have the required strength of magnetic field and spatial extent to effect near isotropy by magnetic scattering ; d ) if an abrupt change of the composition is measured between the iron knee and the dip or ankle .",
    "we conclude that our own galactic cosmic rays plus the galactic cosmic rays from a radio galaxy shifted in energy in the relativistic shock of an accreting super - massive black hole reproduces the all particle energy spectrum from @xmath0 to @xmath4 ev as measured by the kascade , kascade - grande and the pierre auger observatories . in the scenario proposed here no additional extragalactic source population for ultra high energy particles",
    "is required , contrary to many years of expectation .",
    "that implies that no other sources within the magnetic horizon is viable even at lower particle energies ( @xmath45 ev ) above the switchover between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays .",
    "the scenario proposed here gives a number of predictions , especially as regards the chemical element composition across this entire energy range .",
    "an detailed comparison of the measured and predicted composition is yet to be done .",
    "once these predictions have been falsified or confirmed we will be closer to an understanding of the origin of cosmic rays 100 years after their discovery .",
