    "jets of blazars are often bright over a broad wavelength range ( from radio to @xmath1-rays in extreme cases ) and highly time - variable .",
    "hence , multi - wavelength monitoring is an important technique to understand the physics of jets .",
    "data from the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ and supporting multi - wavelength monitoring programs at other wavebands have generated important recent studies of blazar jets @xcite .",
    "the bright source list from the _ fermi _ 2-yr catalog ( 2fgl ) contains more than 1000 active galactic nuclei , most of which are blazars @xcite .",
    "the number of sources is large and the variability timescale in many flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) is similar at @xmath1-ray and optical  near ir ( oir ) bands .",
    "therefore , one should ideally design oir monitoring programs such that the sampling frequency of a source at oir and @xmath1-ray energies are similar while maintaining a regular cadence for many blazars .    here",
    "we report the discovery of an anomalous flare in a bright blazar , one of the targets of one such project , namely , the yale / smarts optical  near ir monitoring program @xcite . among other _",
    "fermi_-lat monitored blazars in the southern sky , we have followed the variations in emission of pks 0208512 , a blazar at redshift z=1.003 @xcite .",
    "it was discovered in the parkes survey of radio sources @xcite and was detected regularly @xcite by egret on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro)_. most recently , multi - wavelength observations of its large - scale jet were presented in @xcite .",
    "pks 0208512 was originally classified as a bl lac object based on the equivalent width of mgii line @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) resembles that of fsrqs and its broad lines are very luminous but are overwhelmed by the brighter continuum luminosity ( @xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , it should be classified as an fsrq .",
    "pks 0208512 was detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) on board _ fermi _ at a level higher than @xmath510@xmath6 ph @xmath7 sec@xmath4 with a time - binning of 1 day regularly from 2008 september to 2008 december and from 2011 april to 2011 september .",
    "it was too close to the sun at the start of the latter brightening phase .",
    "we obtained well - sampled optical and near - infrared light curves starting 2011 june , when it became observable from ctio , chile as well as the entirety of the interval from 2008 september to 2008 december .",
    "in addition , we monitored this blazar with one observation per night during another oir bright phase from 2009 november to 2010 january during which it was quiescent in @xmath1-rays .",
    "this oir outburst is comparable in brightness and temporal extent to the oir flares in the intervals mentioned above during 2008 and 2011 which do have @xmath1-ray counterparts . in this letter",
    ", we analyze the @xmath1-ray and optical light curves to investigate , in particular , the physical mechanism that can produce this optical  near ir - only outburst .    in section 2 , we present the observations and data reduction procedures . in section 3",
    ", we describe the results .",
    "we discuss possible scenarios that can explain the nature of the observed @xmath1-ray / oir variability in section 4 .",
    "we derived the 0.1300 gev @xmath1-ray flux of pks 0208512 by analyzing data from _ fermi - lat _ using the standard _ fermi - lat science tools _ software package ( version v9r27p1 ) .",
    "we analyzed a region of interest of 15@xmath8 in radius , centered at the position of pks 0208512 , using the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in _",
    "gtlike _ , modeling sources with a simple power law .",
    "we included all sources within 15@xmath8 of pks 0208512 , extracted from the _ fermi _ 2-yr catalog ( 2fgl ) , with their normalizations kept free and spectral indices fixed to their catalog values .",
    "we use the currently recommended p7source_v6 set of the instrument response functions , galactic diffuse background model , and isotropic background model . in the _ fermi _ lat second source catalog ,",
    "pks 0208512 has been modeled with a simple power - law of index 2.39@xmath90.04 and its curve significance is 1.6 .",
    "this value of the curve significance is much lower than 16.0 which indicates switching to a curved spectrum such as log parabola will not improve the fit significantly .",
    "hence , we fix the spectral index of pks 0208512 at 2.39 in the model file used in the _ gtlike _ analysis .",
    "the detection significance of pks 0208512 in 2fgl , which integrates the first 24 months of data , is 35.8@xmath10 .",
    "we calculate the fluxes of pks 0208512 from 1-day integrations during 2008 september to 2012 february , with a detection criterion that the maximum - likelihood test statistic ( ts ) exceed 25.0 .",
    "a ts value of 25.0 is roughly comparable to a 5@xmath10 detection .",
    "this light curve is shown in the top panel of figure [ lc_all ] .",
    "the gev light curve is more sparsely sampled than that in the optical  near ir frequencies .",
    "this is because the blazar was not detectable at ts @xmath11 25.0 level with 1-day integrations for long periods during the 3.5 yr time interval considered here . to investigate the nature of gev variability of this blazar during intervals when it was not detected in 1-day bins",
    ", we also calculate the gev fluxes from 30-day integrations during 2008 september to 2012 february .",
    "we show the monthly light curve in the second panel of figure [ lc_all ] .",
    "the gaps in the monthly light curve consist of bins when pks 0208512 was not detected at ts @xmath11 25.0 level even with a 30-day integration .",
    "we identify three intervals during which pks 0208512 undergoes outbursts at oir wavelengths lasting for @xmath03 months with date ranges i ) mjd 5469054856 ( 2008 august to 2009 january ) ii ) mjd 5508755233 ( 2009 september to 2010 february ) and iii ) mjd 5571255893 ( 2011 may to 2011 november ) .",
    "these intervals are shown as the gray shaded regions in figure [ lc_all ] .",
    "these intervals are defined such that i ) they contain a steady rise of flux by 1.3 magnitudes or more ii ) they contain the corresponding decaying branch down to the  quiescent \" level at which the rise started iii ) in the cases where another steady rise of @xmath12 0.5 magnitude or larger started before the flux level decreased to the  quiescent \" level , then the interval is cut off at the start of the said rise and iv ) the length of each interval is 2 months or more . while defining ",
    "steady \" rise or decay , we ignore small fluctuations in the rising or decaying branch which are less than 0.5 magnitudes and/or less than a month long because our goal in this work is to investigate the intervals containing longer - term and more powerful outbursts .",
    "we include two large oir outbursts together in interval 3 because they were very close in time and only the decaying branch of the first flare was fully sampled in oir frequencies .",
    "we assume that for our purpose counting these two subsequent outbursts into one interval simplifies the interval definitions without any loss of information .",
    "we test this in subsequent analysis .",
    "in contrast to the three intervals containing large oir outbursts , the source undergoes bright phases in gev energies lasting @xmath01 month only during intervals 1 and 3 . while during intervals 1 and 3 , the blazar was detected at numerous daily bins and all monthly bins , it was detected in no daily bin and only one monthly bin during interval 2 .",
    "the average gev flux during the monthly bin was ( @xmath1310@xmath14 ph @xmath7 sec@xmath4 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude fainter than that in intervals 1 and 3 . to better compare optical and @xmath1-ray variations",
    ", we also obtained a gev light curve of this blazar with a detection criterion of ts @xmath11 4.0 ( comparable to a 2@xmath10 detection ) . we plot this light curve for all three intervals along with @xmath15band variability in figure [ lc_zoom13 ] .",
    "all of the measurements in @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath17band are from the andicam instrument on smarts 1.3 m telescope located at ctio , chile .",
    "andicam is a dual - channel imager with a dichroic that feeds an optical ccd and an ir imager , which can obtain simultaneous data at one optical and one near - ir band . for details of data",
    "acquisition , calibration and data reduction procedures , see @xcite .",
    "we obtained the x - ray flux and hardness ratio during the same interval from the _",
    "swift_-xrt monitoring program of _",
    "fermi_-lat sources of interest .",
    "most of the observations were carried out with exposure times of @xmath121 ks .",
    "the mean count rate was 0.07 cts / s in 0.3 - 10.0 kev energy range and the mean background count rate was 0.0007 cts / s during this entire period .",
    "as in the optical , x - ray variability was present during all three intervals .",
    "we use the _ swift_-xrt data products generator @xcite to derive the average photon index during the three relevant intervals .",
    "the photon index stays between 1.58 and 1.75 , indicating no significant difference between intervals .",
    "the gaps in the x - ray light curve denotes intervals during which pks 0208512 was not observed by _",
    "swift_. @xmath16 , @xmath15 , and @xmath17band light curves , and the variation of the @xmath18 color , x - ray flux and hardness ratio are shown in figure [ lc_all ] .",
    "from figure [ lc_zoom13 ] , it is evident that the gev and @xmath15band variability are remarkably well - correlated during intervals 1 and 3 . to confirm this , we cross - correlate the @xmath1-ray and",
    "@xmath15band light curves using the discrete cross - correlation function ( dccf ; * ? ? ?",
    "a similar cross - correlation analysis for interval 2 was not possible due to infrequent detection even at ts @xmath11 4.0 level .",
    "as shown in figure  [ dccf_zoom13 ] , the @xmath1-ray and @xmath19-band variability in this blazar during both intervals are very strongly correlated with zero time lag .",
    "this is consistent with similar correlated @xmath1-ray and optical / near - infrared variability seen in many other blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the degree of correlation and lack of a significant lag can be explained by the standard leptonic scenario in which the @xmath1-rays and oir emission are generated by the same relativistic electrons in the jet through inverse - compton and synchrotron processes , respectively .",
    "the source of the seed photons that are being scattered may be the synchrotron photons generated within the jet , in which case it is termed synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process @xcite , or from outside the jet ( radiation from broad emission line region , accretion disk , or dusty torus ) , termed external compton or ec process @xcite .",
    "both ssc and ec scenarios predict strong correlation with zero time lag .",
    "as shown in figure [ lc_all ] , the source underwent an optical  near ir outburst during interval 2 .",
    "the increase of brightness was comparable to that in interval 1 and the @xmath18 color variations ( bottom panel of figure [ lc_all ] ) were similar to those in intervals 1 and 3 .",
    "but unlike those flares , in interval 2 , there was no significant increase in the gev flux and the average gev flux was smaller than average flux values of intervals 1 and 3 by at least an order of magnitude .    to try to understand the physical differences among these flares , we investigated more closely the oir spectral index and color in intervals 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "figure [ colormag ] shows the @xmath18 vs. @xmath19 color magnitude diagram as well as the corresponding @xmath18 spectral index along with the @xmath15band light curve .",
    "surprisingly , there is no clear difference in the above properties between intervals 2 and 1 .",
    "@xcite showed that many blazars show redder @xmath18 colors when brighter and suggested this was because the jet is redder than the accretion disk . when the jet gets brighter  and the jet has much larger amplitude variations than the disk  the overall color reddens .",
    "pks 0208512 shows this familiar trend in the color - magnitude diagram during flares 1 and 2 . in flare 3 , the color reddens as the source brightens , but it remains much redder than in flares 1 and 2 . at the brightest end ,",
    "the color changes are minimal , again unlike flares 1 and 2 .",
    "comparable trends are seen in many blazars @xcite .",
    "this may occur when the jet becomes so much brighter than the disk that a further increase in jet brightness does not affect the color anymore .",
    "it is possible that during interval 3 , the synchrotron peak of the sed is at a lower frequency than it was during intervals 1 and 2 . this would make the near - ir portion of the sed steeper .",
    "hence , the bluer disk emission will be more dominant in the oir bands when the jet emission is weak .",
    "this may cause @xmath18 values to be redder during the brighter phase and bluer during the fainter phase than intervals 1 and 2 as observed .",
    "note that there is no significant difference in the nature of the gev/@xmath15band correlation in the two consecutive flares during interval 3 ( figure [ lc_zoom13 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the data points corresponding to those two flares overlap with each other ( figure [ colormag ] ) indicating no significant difference in the color - magnitude behavior . this is consistent with including them together as part of the same interval .",
    "the behavior of pks 0208512 shows complex spectral behavior during three strong optical / near - infrared flares .",
    "we considered what physical process(es ) could explain the anomalously low @xmath1-ray flux during interval 2 , even as the oir colors remain very similar .",
    "there is one scenario in which a change at optical  near ir wavelengths is not accompanied by a change in the gev energies , namely , the optical synchrotron emission is due to a change in the magnetic field only , i.e. , its magnitude and/or direction , while the gev emission is due to a temporarily steady external compton process .",
    "inverse - compton emission depends on the total number of emitting electrons ( n@xmath20 ) , doppler factor ( @xmath21 ) , and the number of seed photons available for scattering while synchrotron emission depends on n@xmath20 , @xmath21 , as well as the magnetic field and the viewing angle in the form bsin@xmath22 , where viewing angle ( @xmath22 ) is defined as the angle between the direction of the magnetic field vector and the line of sight .",
    "variability in the observed @xmath1-ray and oir emission can be generated by changes in any one or a combination of these parameters .",
    "hence , we conclude that the oir outburst during interval 2 might be caused by a change in the magnetic field in the emitting region without any change in the other two parameters described above .",
    "the critical frequency ( @xmath23 ) at which most of the synchrotron emission occurs is proportional to the magnetic field ( bsin@xmath22 ) while the synchrotron flux is proportional to ( bsin@xmath22)@xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath15band flux increases by @xmath121.4 mag during interval 2 which is equivalent to an increase of brightness by a factor of @xmath123.6 .",
    "the required change in bsin@xmath22 for this to be caused by a change in magnetic field only is an increase by a factor @xmath121.9 .",
    "while this will increase @xmath23 by the same factor , its observational detection is difficult due to i ) the uncertainty in the exact value of @xmath23 in fsrqs including pks 0208512 , and ii ) the possible presence of a non - trivial bluer accretion disk component in the optical emission which also affects the slope of the oir spectrum .",
    "this may explain the overlap of the color - magnitude behavior of intervals 1 and 2 in figure [ colormag ] .    the x - ray emission from fsrqs is often dominated by the ssc process @xcite which means that changes in magnetic field should lead to x - ray variability at a level similar to those changes .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the relative variability in optical and x - ray flux seen here .",
    "we note that the optical synchrotron emission and the ssc x - rays are produced by different parts of the electron distribution . assuming a b field of 1 gauss , synchrotron emission at optical wavelengths is generated by electrons of lorentz factor @xmath1 @xmath12 @xmath25 while ssc x - rays are produced by @xmath1 @xmath12 @xmath26 assuming average seed photons to be at the ir wavelength range where the synchrotron peak occurs for most fsrqs .",
    "the difference in the oir and x - ray variability , if any , in 0208 - 512 during interval 2 can be attributed to this .    in another possible scenario , the large difference in the gev / oir ratio between intervals 1 and 3 vs interval 2",
    "may be caused by the location of the outbursts .",
    "the acceleration and collimation of magnetohydrodynamically launched jets occur over an extended region @xcite , possibly as high as @xmath12@xmath25 times the schwarszchild radius .",
    "hence , an outburst taking place closer to the black hole may be associated with a smaller bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in contrast the corresponding magnetic field and particle density will be larger due to its compactness .",
    "it has been shown that the ec / synchrotron ratio can be dramatically different depending on the location where a given outburst takes place , with ec becoming relatively more dominant for outbursts occurring farther down the jet @xcite . the apparent seed photon field seen by the emitting electrons",
    "is boosted by a factor of @xmath28 causing a significant dependence of the ec / synchrotron ratio on @xmath27 . if the outburst during interval 2 is generated closer to the bh where @xmath27 is smaller while the outbursts in intervals 1 and 3 are produced farther down the jet where @xmath27 is larger , the optical  near ir emission will be significantly more dominating than that in the gev bands during interval 2 than the other two .",
    "a factor of two decrease in @xmath27 coupled with a factor of two increase in b can produce the change of ec / synchrotron ratio we see from interval 1 to 2 .    in this alternative scenario ,",
    "the ssc x - rays increase when the ec component is weaker because a larger fraction of the total dissipation occurs through ssc process .",
    "however , the contribution of the ec component at the x - ray energies decrease at the same time causing the observed x - ray flux to be similar or even lower depending on specific parameters of the source @xcite , as observed here .",
    "this is one of the very few cases where one of two specific physical scenarios can be identified for certain observed events in a blazar jet .",
    "these events can be ideal candidates for detailed modeling of the time variable sed to provide stronger constrains on the relevant physical parameters .",
    "this will be addressed in a future paper .",
