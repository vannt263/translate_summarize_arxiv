    "the recent discovery by the babar collaboration of a new resonance , with a mass around @xmath6 gev and a narrow width , in the @xmath7 final state  @xcite has provoked a great deal of interest from experimenters and theorists alike .",
    "the cleo collaboration  @xcite has confirmed this resonance .",
    "both experiments interpret this as the lowest lying of the four @xmath8-wave states , the @xmath9 with @xmath2 .",
    "a variety of theory papers have been published  @xcite either supporting this interpretation or presenting alternative hypotheses of `` exotic '' states .",
    "these alternatives are motivated by potential model results  @xcite , which suggest that the @xmath3 scalar meson mass is around @xmath10 gev and hence above the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "one could argue the merits of a particular model , but this becomes irrelevant if the spectrum can directly determined from qcd .",
    "a mass below the @xmath11 threshold would also explain the narrowness of the state .",
    "there have been a number of previous lattice qcd calculations of the @xmath12 states in the @xmath0 meson spectrum .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained 500(80 ) mev for the @xmath13 mass splitting ( from their figure 27 ) using nrqcd at a fixed lattice spacing of 0.18 fm .",
    "lewis and woloshyn  @xcite obtained 530(15)(5 ) mev at a fixed lattice spacing of 0.11 fm also using nrqcd . with quenched relativistic heavy quarks ,",
    "boyle  @xcite obtained a mass splitting of 544(20 ) mev at a fixed lattice spacing of 0.07 fm .",
    "although the calculation used the same ensemble of gauge configurations as this work , the propagators were computed using a slightly different action and different definition of the lattice quark mass .",
    "recently bali  @xcite presented results in the static limit for the heavy quark and obtained a value of @xmath14 mev for the scalar - pseudoscalar mass splitting in this limit .",
    "all the previous lattice qcd calculations of the @xmath0 spectrum were done at fixed lattice spacing in quenched qcd . in this calculation",
    "we take the continuum limit in quenched qcd , so that lattice artifacts are under control .",
    "the lattice volumes are large enough ( greater than @xmath15 ) that finite size effects should be small .",
    "we also report results from the first unquenched calculation at fixed lattice spacing .",
    "the remaining systematic uncertainty is due to dynamical @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks having unphysically large masses .    in the heavy quark limit , the spin of the heavy quark decouples from the rest of the system .",
    "the observable states can be labelled by the total angular momentum of the light quark @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8-wave states have @xmath12 and thus @xmath19 .",
    "this combined with the spin of the heavy quark produces two doublets .",
    "the @xmath20 doublet contains a @xmath21 and a @xmath22 state , the @xmath23 doublet contains a @xmath22 and @xmath24 state .",
    "the two @xmath22 states do not have definite charge conjugation and so can mix . on the lattice only the lightest state in this channel",
    "can be determined easily .    in the double limit of heavy quark and chiral symmetry , the two heavy light multiplets ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 , are degenerate .",
    "the effect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is to split these parity partners , such that the mass splittings @xmath4 and @xmath5 are equal  @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by the cleo collaboration  @xcite who obtain splittings of @xmath27 and @xmath28 mev respectively .",
    "it is interesting to explore the extent to which qcd reproduces this remarkable agreement .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath3 mesons has been determined on four ensembles of gauge configurations .",
    "three have different lattice spacings ( @xmath29 ) and were generated in the quenched approximation , which enables the continuum limit to be taken .",
    "the fourth ensemble was generated with two degenerate flavours of dynamical quarks , and the lattice spacing matched to that of the coarsest quenched ensemble .",
    "for all the ensembles , the wilson gauge action and the non - perturbatively @xmath30 improved wilson fermion action were used .",
    "the lattice parameters are detailed in table  [ tab : ensembles ] .",
    "the procedures for generating the dynamical ensemble and matching to the coarsest quenched ensemble are described in  @xcite .",
    "meson correlation functions were computed with several different heavy quark masses which span the charm quark mass , and several light quark masses around the strange quark mass . for the dynamical ensemble",
    "only one sea quark mass is used , for which the ratio @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "this corresponds to qcd with two dynamical flavours of mass slightly above the strange quark mass .",
    "the details of extracting the spectrum from lattice correlation functions , and the results for the @xmath33-wave @xmath34 meson spectrum for the finer two lattice spacings can be found in  @xcite . to measure the mass splittings , the ratio of correlation functions at large times",
    "is fitted .",
    "we have checked that the results from computing the @xmath35 mass splitting directly is the same , with the same statistical errors as obtained by combining the results obtained for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath36 splittings .    in quenched qcd , or in simulations with unphysical heavy sea quarks , there is an ambiguity in the determination of the lattice spacing in physical units . for typical simulation parameters used today this",
    "is estimated to be of the order of @xmath37 .",
    "the scale is set throughout this calculation from the static quark potential using @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is unambiguous for each ensemble , and so is a good choice for comparing results from different ensembles .",
    "however , there is no agreed experimental value for @xmath38 .",
    "sommer originally advocated @xmath40  fm .",
    "the lattice spacing obtained from the @xmath41 mass ratio ( method of planes )  @xcite corresponds to @xmath42  fm on the ensembles used in this work .",
    "determinations of the lattice spacing from the kaon decay constant , the nucleon mass or the rho mass correspond to @xmath38 values ranging from approximately @xmath43 to @xmath44 fm @xcite .",
    "for these reasons we take the value of @xmath38 to be 0.55  fm .",
    "the analysis has been repeated using @xmath40  fm throughout , and the difference is taken as an estimate of the systematic uncertainty in the scale .    the strange quark mass is set by from the light - light pseudoscalar mass with the experimental kaon mass as input  @xcite .",
    "similarly the charm quark mass is set from the heavy - light pseudoscalar mass with the experimental @xmath0 meson mass as input .",
    "for each of the four ensembles , the mass splittings @xmath4 and @xmath5 are equal within statistical errors .",
    "these results and the continuum extrapolation which is linear in @xmath45 are shown in figure  [ fig : cont_extrap ] .",
    "furthermore , these splittings are also equal in the continuum limit , in agreement with heavy hadron chiral effective theory and experiment . at the coarsest lattice spacing the effect of introducing sea quarks with a mass close to the strange",
    "is to slightly lower the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 mass splittings , but this is not statistically significant .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] and table  [ tab : spectrum ] is the comparison of the lattice results along with the experimentally measured spectrum .",
    "the dynamical results appear to have smaller error bars and to be systematically higher than the quenched result .",
    "these effects are due to extrapolating the quenched results and are absent at fixed lattice spacing .",
    "the computed @xmath36 splitting is too small , a well known failing of the quenched approximation  @xcite .",
    "evidently the dynamical sea quark mass is too large to change this , as has been observed before in the light hadron spectrum on the same ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the lattice results for the @xmath3 @xmath46 and the lightest @xmath47 mesons are consistent , albeit within large statistical and systematic uncertainties , with the masses of the states discovered recently by babar and cleo .",
    "although @xmath16 and @xmath17 sea - quark effects are not yet properly included , these lattice results provide the most reliable computation of the @xmath3 spectrum to date .",
    "our errors are too large to exclude exotic states based on potential models . however , there is no evidence from our lattice qcd calculations that exotics are required to explain the babar and cleo discoveries .",
    "the lattice data was generated on the cray t3d and t3e systems at epcc supported by , epsrc grant gr / k41663 , pparc grants gr / l22744 and ppa / g / s/1998/00777 .",
