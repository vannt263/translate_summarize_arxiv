    "granular materials present interesting and unusual physical properties @xcite .",
    "as the collisions among grains are highly dissipative , dynamical states ( such as a granular flow ) need a continuous energy supply .",
    "otherwise , dissipation quickly stops the motion .",
    "even with a sustained energy input , granular flows can in some cases get jammed and halt @xcite .",
    "a classical example of a system prone to jamming is a silo discharged by gravity .",
    "the flow of particles may be suddenly arrested by the formation of a blocking arch ( or vault ) if the size of the outlet does not exceed a few times the size of the particles @xcite .",
    "controversy still goes on about whether there exists or not a certain size of the orifice above which jamming is not possible .",
    "it seems that such a critical size can be found for a 3d silo @xcite but not in a quasi-2d setup @xcite .",
    "whatever it may be , in many cases it is interesting or unavoidable to reduce the size of the orifice in order to limit the flow rate ; and the price to pay is an increased jamming probability .",
    "hence the significance of the methods used to improve the flowing of grains , among which vibrations ( either local or global ) applied to the silo are quite common @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , clogging still occurs . during the discharge of a vibrated silo through a small orifice ,",
    "blocking arches may form .",
    "these structures can stop the flow even when the silo is being vibrated .",
    "however , the flow may be spontaneously restarted thanks to the destabilization of a blocking arch induced by the continuous excitation .",
    "eventually , some robust jam will develop , in the sense that the continuous vibration is unable to restart the flow . a stronger external perturbation is then needed to unjam the system .",
    "previous works @xcite in non vibrated silos characterized the jamming by measuring the amount of grains delivered between two consecutive jams . for lack of a better term to designate this quantity , it was called an _ avalanche_.",
    "we have borrowed this word because it conveys the idea of a granular flow that starts and stops abruptly , but should not be confused with the rapid landslide or flood of material along a slope , and in particular , on the surface of granular piles @xcite . in the discharge of a silo , the avalanche size is the number of grains that flows through the orifice from the moment when the outpouring starts until the formation of a blockage that arrests the flow . in the absence of vibration ,",
    "the avalanche size is a well defined quantity , as the arches or vaults that block the orifice are robust : once the flow is stopped , it does not resume by itself even after a long waiting time .",
    "it has been shown that in silos of two and three dimensions the avalanche size distribution displays an exponential tail .",
    "this can be understood if each grain has a probability @xmath0 of passing through the outlet without forming a blocking arch that is constant during the avalanche @xcite . in a recent paper janda _",
    "@xcite related the value of this probability in a quasi-2d silo to the arch size distribution within a 2d static granular layer .    when vibrations are applied , the notion of avalanche is further complicated due to the fact that arches blocking the orifice can break down after a certain time .",
    "this results in an intermittent flow ; in this case , in order to conclude that the flow has stopped permanently , one has to wait for a long time after grains cease to come out from the silo .",
    "the avalanches can contain themselves short lapses during which the flow has temporarily stopped , due maybe to arches that blocked the exit and were broken apart by the vibrations shortly afterwards . in sect .",
    "[ sec : avasize ] we will explain how we choose a meaningful waiting time for the jams .    in this work , we present experimental results on the avalanche size distribution that allows for a comparison between vibrated and nonvibrated silos .",
    "we are able to provide the jamming probability in vibrated silos , and formulate a simple model that extends previous results and allows us to quantify the effect of vibrations .",
    "it can be conjectured that the application of vibrations to a silo may lead to two mechanisms that could cause a reduction of robust jamming events : ( i ) a decrease in the probability of the arch formation , which are the cause of blockages , and ( ii ) the loss of stability of these arches after they are generated .",
    "we will show that the second mechanism is the responsible for the appearance of larger avalanches when a gentle vibration is applied .",

    "the inset shows a photograph ( from the bottom ) and a sketch of the cross section of the changeable part in which the hole is bored.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the experimental setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sistexp ] ) comprises a flat bottomed cylindrical silo with a circular hole of diameter @xmath1 in its base .",
    "the part making the outlet orifice can be replaced , and in this way @xmath1 can be changed .",
    "the silo is filled with delrin spheres ( diameter @xmath2 mm and weight @xmath3 mg ) .",
    "the dimensionless size @xmath4 of the orifice is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "the diameter of the silo is more than @xmath6 times the particle diameter in order to prevent that the lateral walls influence the jamming probability @xcite . the silo is routinely refilled so that the height of the granular material is always more than twice the diameter of the silo .",
    "a pass - through photosensor was placed just below the outlet in order to detect whether beads are flowing or not at every time ; the resolution is such that one single bead can not go through it undetected . at the bottom of the silo , a box collects the grains that fall from the exit .",
    "this box is placed on an electronic scales , with an accuracy such that a single bead can be resolved .",
    "when the flow is arrested ( see below the criterion we use to define that the flow has stopped permanently ) , the weight of the avalanche is obtained from the scales , and its size in number of beads is calculated .",
    "then , a new avalanche is triggered with a jet of compressed air from beneath the orifice , a technique used in previous works @xcite .",
    "the whole silo is continuously shaken by a pneumatic vibrator actuating in the vertical direction . in order to facilitate the vibrating movement and to isolate it from the measuring devices ,",
    "the structure is supported by three air cushions , controlled through mechanical valves .",
    "we have carried out the measurements at a fixed effective dimensionless acceleration @xmath7 and at a frequency of @xmath8 hz . here",
    "@xmath9 is the rms value of the acceleration as measured by an accelerometer attached to the silo base , averaged over 200 cycles .",
    "in fact , this experimental set - up is quite similar to another used in previous works ( see @xcite ) with the addition of the pneumatic vibrator and the air cushions on which the silo rests .",
    "it is interesting to begin by inspecting a typical signal from the photosensor , which is binarized to one or zero depending on whether or not a particle is blocking the light beam . two signals ( each one registered over the duration of a single avalanche ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_photo ] : one of them was obtained when the silo was being vibrated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_photo ] * b * ) , and the other was taken with the vibration off ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_photo ] * a * ) . in the latter case , there are short interruptions of the flow ; but once the orifice gets jammed , the flow is arrested permanently . on the other hand , when the silo is being vibrated , there are stretches during which grains are flowing separated by time intervals when the flow is interrupted",
    ". these can be significantly longer than in the nonvibrated case .",
    "this means that a jam has developed , but the vibrations are able to restart the outpouring .",
    "eventually a blockage is formed that stops the flow permanently because the external vibration can not break down the blocking arch ; at least within our experimental time scales . in this sense , fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_photo ] * b * could be described as if there were avalanches inside the avalanche .",

    "alternatively , it could also be conjectured that somehow the vibration inhibits the formation of arches .",
    "a reduced probability of arch formation would also result in longer avalanches .",

    "now , we introduce a new variable @xmath50 , which represents the probability that , once a blocking arch is formed , a particle flows through the exit as a consequence of the destabilization of the arch due to the continuous vibration .",
    "the probability @xmath51 is a measure of the `` arch breakage probability '' , and does not take into account the time that destabilization may require for a given arch .",

    ", no more particles will ever flow out of the silo will be @xmath52 .",
    "we assume that all arches blocking a given orifice have the same breakage probability @xmath51 for a given vibration intensity .",
    "this is a fair approximation since , for a particular @xmath4 , the blocking arches are expected to have a typical size .",
    "notice that this might not be true in hoppers , where arches form at different positions along the hopper walls , and hence a wide distribution of arch sizes may be present for a given exit size .",

    "[ fig : unstable_jams ] is that for a nonvibrated silo , the probability of finding a time interval during which the flow is temporarily stopped decreases abruptly with @xmath72 ( note the logarithmic scale in the plot ) . with vibrations ,",

    "[ fig : unstable_jams ] display a finite number of events for large @xmath72 , indicating that within the avalanches longer intervals are present during which no grain comes out from the exit orifice .",

    "these long events suggest that there are flow interruptions that might have resulted in the end of an avalanche should the silo had not been vibrated .",
    "the distribution of @xmath72 smaller than @xmath74 shows similar behavior for vibrated and nonvibrated silos .",
    "clearly , this part of the distribution corresponds to the temporal scales associated with the `` interparticle '' time intervals in the continuous flow @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : unstable_jams ] suggests that a temporal cutoff can be established to separate the vibrated and the nonvibrated dynamics of a few tenths of a second ( where the distributions for the vibrated and nonvibrated cases begin to differ ) .",
    "we decided to take @xmath75 as this cutoff .",
    "although this choice is somehow arbitrary , we checked that the results presented below do not depend strongly on this value ( for example , @xmath76 and @xmath77 yield similar outcomes ) .    following this line of reasoning ,",
    "let us call a _ weak jam _ all the events corresponding to @xmath78 .",
    "then we can readily count the number of weak jams ( @xmath79 ) and take that value as an indication of the number of times an arch has been formed and broken due to vibration . since the number of robust jams ( @xmath80 ) corresponds to the total number of avalanches studied for given @xmath4 and @xmath13 , @xmath50 can be obtained by dividing the number of weak jams @xmath79 by the number of total jams ( weak plus robust ) : @xmath81 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta ] the results for @xmath82 obtained with this direct measure are reported ( open squares ) .",
    "the agreement with the values of @xmath51 obtained from the probabilistic model under the assumption of the independence of @xmath0 from @xmath13 is reasonable .",
    "we then claim that the probability @xmath49 that a particle forms a blocking arch along its neighbors at the time of passing through the exit during the continuous flow does not depend on the external vibrations applied to the system , at least for the gentle vibration intensity we used .",
    "therefore , the main role of vibration is to break blocking arches once they are formed .",
    "it is now possible to measure the size of the avalanches inside the avalanches , with which we refer to the amount of material unloaded in the vibrated silo between two weak jams , as explained above . from these results we obtain the avalanche size distribution inside an avalanche , and the corresponding weak jamming probability @xmath83 ) .",
    "since we assumed that the cutoff chosen to identify weak jams is such that these truly correspond to the jams that would be stable if vibrations were absent , we expect the probability distribution of those avalanches in a vibrated silo to display the same properties as normal avalanches in a nonvibrated silo . in fig .",
    "[ fig : j100 ] we can see this is indeed the case , since @xmath84 ( @xmath37 ) coincides with @xmath30 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we have reported experimental results of the avalanche size distribution and jamming probability in the discharge of a vertically vibrated silo .",
    "the first result that becomes apparent is that the presence of vibrations significantly increases the size of the avalanches .",
    "additionally , we have shown that in a vibrated silo the discharge of grains is intermittent , due to the appearance of temporary blockages of the exit orifice .",
    "taking as a starting point a previous model for a nonvibrated silo , we have extended it and explained the new results by introducing a bivariate probability distribution taking into account ( a ) the probability @xmath0 that a particle pass through the outlet without forming an arch with its neighbors during continuous flow , and ( b ) the probability @xmath51 that a particle flows through the exit once and arch has been formed thanks to the destabilization promoted by vibration .",
    "assuming that @xmath0 does not depend on the presence of vibrations , which is a fair assumption for gentle vibrations , the values of the mean avalanche size for vibrated and nonvibrated silos provide a straightforward estimation of @xmath51 for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "besides , a direct measure of @xmath51 has been carried out by recording the time interval within each avalanche during which grains do not flow through the exit .",
    "the two measurements agree remarkably well , indicating that the main effect of vibration is the breakage of arches once they are formed without affecting significantly the arch formation probability .",
    "additionally , the result of the monotonic increase of @xmath51 with respect to the outlet size displays an expected behavior : the greater the arch , the more unstable against small perturbations .",
    "further measurements of the stability of arches must be carried out for different vibration frequencies and strong amplitudes to asses the full range of vibration parameters for which this explanation is valid , _",
