    "<S> we investigate @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis during the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) explosion of supernova in a massive star of 13 @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the case of the spherical explosion , jet - like explosion due to the combined effects of the rotation and magnetic field lowers the electron fraction significantly inside the layers above the iron core . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ejected material of low electron fraction responsible for the @xmath0-process comes out from the silicon rich layer of the presupernova model . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the production up to the third peak in the solar @xmath0-process elements . </S>",
    "<S> we examine whether the fission affects the @xmath0-process paths by using the full nuclear reaction network with both the spontaneous and @xmath2-delayed fission included . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we pay particular attention how the mass formula affects the @xmath0-process peaks with use of two mass formulae . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that both formulae can reproduce the global abundance pattern up to the third peak though detailed distributions are rather different . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that there are variations in the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis if the mhd effects play an important role in the supernova explosion . </S>"
