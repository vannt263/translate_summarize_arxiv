    "are expected to be available on dark energy parameters , including constraints on the evolution of its equation of state parameter @xmath20 @xcite .    in order to fully realize the cosmological potential of large cluster samples , it is important to understand the cluster mass - observable relations accurately , at least statistically .",
    "it is very unlikely that the structure of clusters will be understood from ab  initio calculations to the level of precision required for the theoretical uncertainties not to dominate over the exquisite statistical errors  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in principle , when multiple observables depend on the same mass , the mass  observable relation can be accurately determined from the data itself , simultaneously with cosmological parameters .",
    "several works have proposed and quantified the constraints from such ` self ",
    "calibration' @xcite , using parameterized phenomenological relations for the mass  observable relations ( for example , power  law scalings , or arbitrary evolution in pre - specified redshifts bins ) .",
    "it has been argued recently @xcite that even if cluster structure is not precisely predictable , parameterized physical models can further improve on such phenomenological self  calibration , especially when multiple observables ( such as x  ray flux and sunyaev - zeldovich [ sz ] decrement ) can be predicted from the same physical model @xcite . in light of this potential , it is important to fit physically motivated cluster models to as many cluster observables as possible ; one then hopes that future observations of larger cluster samples will require further fine  tuning of these models , and , at the same time , deliver useful cosmological constraints @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential of clusters is dominated by dark matter , whose behavior is determined by gravity alone , and is therefore robustly predictable .",
    "the dark matter profiles of galaxy clusters , apart from the innermost regions , are indeed well understood from three  dimensional numerical simulations @xcite , and are nearly self - similar , as expected .",
    "the physics of gas , on the other hand , involves complicated non - gravitational processes such as radiative cooling and star formation , galaxy evolution , and various forms of feedback .",
    "if these processes were unimportant , the intracluster gas would trace the self  similar dark matter profile , and its global properties should obey simple scaling relations @xcite . specifically ,",
    "its x - ray luminosity @xmath21 , if dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung , as for clusters with temperature @xmath22 kev , should scale as @xmath23 .",
    "this relation is indeed obeyed by clusters in hydrodynamic simulations without non - gravitational processes @xcite . however , the observed @xmath3 scaling relation is significantly steeper than the self - similar prediction , closer to @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that the effect of non - gravitational processes on the intracluster gas is not negligible , even for `` bulk '' observables .    a long  standing proposal for the dominant such non  gravitational effect is that the intracluster gas is heated by some energy input ( from star formation , supernovae explosion , galactic winds and/or active galactic nuclei [ agn ] ) , raising the gas to a higher adiabat before the clusters collapse .",
    "many authors have investigated the effect of such a preheating , and have shown that simply imposing a minimum `` entropy floor '' for the intracluster gas naturally breaks the self  similarity , and steepens the @xmath3 relation as required by the data @xcite .",
    "heating idea is further supported by the discovery of excess entropy in the inner regions of low  temperature clusters , which suggests the existence of a universal entropy floor @xcite , and by several other independent lines of evidence ( for a brief summary and a list of references , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a simple model of pre  heating consists of shifting the entropy profile by an overall additive constant , representing the cumulative effect of non  gravitational processes , assumed to be roughly uniform throughout the gas  ( e.g. * ?",
    "recent work has tested this simple model , by comparing its predictions with hydrodynamical simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter yb07 ) .",
    "the model reproduces the simulation results very well , but comparisons with observations show that although it can predict the global x  ray scaling relations , the model can not reproduce the observed entropy profiles @xcite in detail .",
    "this requires the model to be further developed , but as far as the global properties are concerned , it appears to be successful , and it is therefore useful to understand the average properties of the intracluster gas .    in this paper , we adopt this simple preheating model , and focus on comparisons with both the observed @xmath3 scaling relations in the redshift range @xmath25 , and the observed cumulative number counts of the x - ray clusters .",
    "a previous study @xcite calculated the impact of preheating on the x  ray scaling relations , using a sample of 12 simulated clusters , and found a good fit to the data on local clusters ( but has not explicitly compared the expected evolution to observations , and has not made simultaneous predictions for the number counts ) .",
    "our work is also somewhat similar to a more recent study by @xcite , who present a more detailed physical model for the intracluster gas , and show that it can reproduce local x  ray scaling relations ( this paper also did not study evolution ) .",
    "our goal here is to clarify ( i ) whether the model can simultaneously explain both the scaling relations _ and _ number counts of galaxy clusters , and ( ii ) whether the amount of entropy required evolves with redshift . in comparing our predictions to the @xmath3 scaling relations and the number counts",
    ", we also study the effects of scatter in the @xmath3 and @xmath26 relations , and the corresponding selection biases that arise in flux limited survey @xcite .",
    "our first goal is motivated by our earlier study @xcite , in which we found that a similar preheating model , with the entropy adjusted to reproduce observed x  ray and sz scaling relations , tends to overpredict the number counts of bright clusters , even with a relatively low normalization ( @xmath27 ) of the power spectrum .",
    "a similar discrepancy was found by ( * ? ? ?",

    "the effect of preheating is then realized by adding a constant @xmath2 to @xmath58 , @xmath59 where the value of @xmath2 can be determined once the amount of energy injected into the cosmic gas , and the density of the gas at the time of the injection , is specified .",
    "convective stability requires the specific entropy @xmath33 to be a monotonically increasing function of radius @xcite , and hence of @xmath40 .",
    "the above prescription of preheating may change @xmath40 as a function of @xmath44 , but it does not change the order of the gas shells . the entropy profile , together with the hydrostatic equilibrium and gas mass conservation equations , @xmath60 can be used to solve for the pressure and density distribution of the intracluster gas .",
    "combined with the equation of state for ideal gases , the temperature profile of the gas also follows from the solutions . in equation  ( [ eqn : equil ] ) ,",

    "the pressure at the same position is found by giving it a trial value and integrating equations  ( [ eq : dpdr]-[eq : dmgdr ] ) until the pressure at @xmath53 matches the expected momentum flux of infalling gas , @xmath67 here we assume the accreting gas is cold @xcite , and that it falls freely from the turnaround radius ( @xmath68 ) and is shocked at the virial radius .",
    "we assume @xmath69 , so that the free - fall velocity @xmath70 from @xmath68 to @xmath56 is given by @xmath71 .",
    "the postshock gas density is @xmath72 ( see below for the calculation of @xmath73 ) . under extreme conditions ,",
    "the free - fall kinetic energy is totally transformed into thermal energy , and the post  shock gas has a pressure as given above ; this value agrees with that adopted in yb07 , matching their simulation results .",
    "( besides the difference in identifying clusters , our boundary pressure has a numerical factor of @xmath74 compared to theirs of 0.7 . )",
    "these two boundary conditions are sufficient for solving equations  ( [ eq : dpdr]-[eq : dmgdr ] ) .",
    "the result is that the gas fraction @xmath40 within the virial radius is 0.88 without preheating , and somewhat less when preheating is turned on .    the matter distribution in virialized clusters is well described by the nfw @xcite model as found from n - body pure cdm simulations .",
    "adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations without non -",
    "gravitational processes find gas density profiles quite similar to the nfw shape , except in the central regions @xcite , where the gas density levels off .",
    "when preheating is turned on , the inner gas density profile becomes even shallower and deviates more from the nfw shape . since the gas is subdominant in mass , we neglect its effect on the distribution of dark matter .",
    "( though it is found that gas will cause the dark matter halo to be slightly more concentrated ; e.g. @xcite . ) for simplicity , here we assume the dark matter profile retains the nfw shape , i.e. @xmath75 . for a cluster virialized at redshift z with mass @xmath46 , its nfw density profile is given as , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the critical density of the universe , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are parameters determined from the concentration parameter @xmath80 .",

    "comparisons to relations involving the mass of the cluster ( such as the mass - temperature relation ) are somewhat more direct from a theoretical point of view , but any such comparison would , in any case , have to re - derive cluster masses , using information such as the observed x  ray surface brightness or temperature profiles , and using our own model , for a fair comparison with the data .",
    "we also emphasize that similar comparisons with sz observables will contain valuable additional information ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "there is ample evidence that non  gravitational processes , such as feedback from stars and bhs in galaxies , have injected excess entropy into the intracluster gas , and therefore have modified its density profiles . while in the simplest scenario , the excess entropy is injected at high redshift , well before clusters actually form , and results in a universal entropy floor in galaxy clusters .",
    "a more realistic expectation is that the amount of excess entropy evolves with cosmic epoch , tracking on  going star and bh  formation .",
    "here we studied a simple model of this preheating scenario , and found that it can simultaneously explain both global x  ray scaling relations and number counts of galaxy clusters .",
    "the level of entropy required between @xmath299 is @xmath300 @xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath301^{2/3}[(1+z)/2]^2 $ ] kev per particle if the energy is deposited in gas at overdensity @xmath302 at redshift @xmath82 .",
    "this overall level of enrichment is in agreement with previous studies .",
    "here we find , additionally , evidence that the entropy floor evolves with redshift , increasing by about @xmath298 from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "this fractional increase is in rough agreement with the evolution expected if the heating rate follows the global evolution of the agn .",
    "the normalization @xmath303 preferred when x  ray cluster number counts are fit with our model is somewhat higher than the best ",
    "fit value from the three ",
    "wmap _ data . for a flux  limited cluster catalog",
    ", we also find that including an intrinsic scatter in log  luminosity at both fixed temperature and at fixed mass does not have a big effect on the results .",
    "the models presented in this paper should be improved in future work , refined to fit detailed cluster profiles , in addition to the evolution of global observables , and allowing a cluster - to - cluster variation of the level of heating , with possible systematic dependence on cluster mass , in addition to redshift .",
    "it will soon be possible to confront this type of more detailed modeling with forthcoming sz observations .",
    "we expect this comparison to securely establish whether the level of entropy is indeed increasing with cosmic epoch , and to place further interesting constraints on both cluster structure models and cosmology .",
