    "consider a transverse element of the cochlear partition comprising the basilar membrane , an inner hair cell ( ihc ) and three ohcs , and the overlying tectorial membrane ( fig .",

    "this additional displacement would couple back to the basilar membrane and augment the movement there .",
    "if electromotility is adjusted such that the ohcs elongate just as much as the tectorial membrane and reticular lamina move upward , however , the basilar membrane does not experience the active force and thus undergoes no additional displacement ( see also movie s1 ) .",
    "a mathematical formulation of this amplification mechanism clarifies its operation .",
    "consider a two - mass model in which the two degrees of freedom are the motion of the basilar membrane , @xmath0 , and that of the complex formed by the hair bundles , reticular lamina , and tectorial membrane , @xmath1 ( fig .",

    "the evoked oscillations of the basilar membrane as well as the hair - bundle complex occur predominantly at the same frequency , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "internal forces @xmath7 arise within hair bundles , where they provide negative damping and introduce nonlinearities ( supporting information ) .",
    "the cell bodies of ohcs can be described as piezoelectric elements  @xcite . for small , physiologically relevant motions",
    "their electrically evoked displacement @xmath8 is proportional to the hair - bundle displacement , which triggers changes in the membrane potential , so @xmath9 with a complex mechanomotility coefficient @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the hair - bundle and basilar - membrane displacements then depend linearly on the forces : @xmath11 the matrix @xmath12 contains the impedances @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the hair - bundle complex and the basilar membrane as well as the coupling impedances @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "2b ) : @xmath17     and the displacement @xmath1 of the hair - bundle complex ( circle ) , which comprises the hair bundles , reticular lamina ( rl ) , and tectorial membrane .",

    "( c ) in the ratchet mechanism displacements of the basilar membrane caused by external forces are communicated to the hair - bundle complex .",
    "internal forces ( red arrow ) in the hair bundles increase the shearing motion , which decouples from basilar - membrane displacement through appropriate length changes of the ohcs ( dotted red arrow ) . for an animated representation of the model , see movie s1 . ]    a key feature of this relation is that the matrix element @xmath18 , which describes the coupling of the internal force to the basilar membrane , vanishes at a critical value @xmath19 . at the same time",
    ", the coupling of the external force to the hair bundle , which is represented by element @xmath20 , remains nonzero .",
    "for the critical value @xmath21 the displacements become @xmath22 the hair - bundle displacement depends on both the internal and external forces , whereas the basilar membrane experiences only the external force . in other words ,",
    "the sound - evoked external force on the basilar membrane is transmitted to the hair bundle , but the internal force from active hair - bundle motility does not feed back onto the motion of the basilar membrane ( fig .  2c ) .",
    "this symmetry - breaking mode has the characteristics of a ratchet in the sense that information flows unidirectionally : information applied as a force against the basilar membrane can be detected in the form of hair - bundle displacement , but force acting on the hair bundle can not be detected at the basilar membrane .",
    "the basilar - membrane displacement equals that occuring when the hair - bundle complex is fixed at @xmath23 and electromotility is absent ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the ratchet mechanism therefore resembles an ideal operational amplifier that neither feeds back on nor draws energy from the input  @xcite .      the magnitude and phase of the critical value @xmath21 depend on the coupling impedances @xmath25 and @xmath26 . under realistic assumptions",
    "@xmath27 is similar to or smaller than @xmath28 and @xmath29 is therefore near unity .",
    "such a value for the mechanomotility coefficient @xmath10 has been measured experimentally for apical ohcs  @xcite .",
    "the phase of @xmath10 is controlled by the complex network of ion channels that regulates the membrane potential depending on the hair - bundle displacement  @xcite .",
    "although experiments on the phase of @xmath10 are not available , theoretical considerations confirm that ohcs have sufficient flexibility through ion - channel regulation to adjust the phase of @xmath10 to a variety of values , and in particular to the phase required for @xmath21 ( supporting information ) .      as its most important characteristic ,",
    "the ratchet mechanism can explain frequency selectivity near the cochlear apex in the absence of a peaked traveling wave .",
    "the resonant frequency of the hair - bundle complex is determined solely by the impedance @xmath13 and the internal forces , and is therefore defined by the properties of the hair bundles and tectorial membrane ( equation 3 )  @xcite . in particular , hair - bundle resonance can occur in the absence of basilar - membrane resonance .",
    "the ratchet mechanism therefore permits the resonant frequency of the hair bundles to follow a logarithmic law along the cochlea , whereas the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane remains significantly greater near the apex ( fig .",
    "3b )  @xcite .",
    "further evidence points to the occurrence of the ratchet mechanism at the cochlear apex but not at the base .",
    "first , the basilar membrane at the base is narrow and presumably tuned to the characteristic frequencies at which auditory - nerve fibers are most sensitive ( fig .",
    "amplification of basilar - membrane motion there is feasible and need not be avoided .",
    "indeed , experiments have demonstrated a strong compressive nonlinearity of basilar - membrane motion at high frequencies .",
    "however , the apex exhibits a wider basilar membrane that experiences stronger viscous forces and whose resonant frequencies deviate from the characteristic frequencies  @xcite .",
    "amplification of basilar - membrane motion near the apex would therefore be highly inefficient .",
    "the absence of a strong compressive nonlinearity in experimental measurements of basilar - membrane displacement in the apical region confirms the lack of basilar - membrane amplification there .",
    "next , the membrane time constant of ohcs restricts electromotility s ability to work on a cycle - by - cycle basis to frequencies below a few kilohertz  @xcite , disabling the ratchet mechanism for higher frequencies . it is noteworthy that the ion channels of apical ohcs differ significantly from those of basal ohcs  @xcite and that apical ohcs are considerably longer than basal ones and can accordingly produce greater length changes  @xcite .",
    "we have quantified these considerations in a one - dimensional model of the cochlea ( supporting information ) .",
    "studies of threshold tuning curves of auditory - nerve fibers in the chinchilla have delineated three distinct regimes that are separated by two crossover frequencies , a high frequency @xmath30  khz and a low frequency @xmath31  khz ( fig .",
    "3 )  @xcite . in our model for the basal regime",
    "i , above @xmath32 , electromotility is negligible owing to the membrane time constant ; each segment of the basilar membrane is tuned to its characteristic frequency . in the transitional regime ii , between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , unidirectional coupling provided by",
    "electromotility occurs but every segment of the basilar membrane still resonates at its characteristic frequency . in the apical regime iii , below @xmath33 , electromotility combines with active hair - bundle motility to implement the ratchet mechanism for amplification .",
    "the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane is therefore of minor importance and remains approximately constant at a value significantly above the range of characteristic frequencies .",
    "( green ) coincides with the critical value @xmath21 ( grey ) .",
    "although electromotility is negligible to the basal side of @xmath32 , it underlies the ratchet mechanism apical to the position of @xmath33 .",
    "( b ) the resonant frequency of the hair - bundle complex ( hb , red ) agrees with that of the basilar membrane ( bm , blue ) only for frequencies above @xmath33 .",
    "( c ) a high - frequency sound stimulus ( @xmath34 khz ) induces a traveling wave that peaks in the basal region .",
    "the displacements of the hair bundles ( red ) coincide with that of the basilar membrane ( blue ) .",
    "elimination of active hair - bundle motility decreases the sensitivity by a factor of @xmath35 ( green , hair bundles ; black , basilar membrane ) indicative of a strong nonlinearity . a low - frequency stimulus ( @xmath36 hz ) triggers a traveling wave that does not peak on the basilar membrane , but the hair - bundle displacement exhibits a resonance enabled by the ratchet mechanism ( same color code ) . without active hair - bundle motion the hair - bundle displacement decreases by a factor of only ten indicative of a weak nonlinearity .",
    "( d ) the phase of the basilar - membrane displacement for @xmath37 has a strongly increasing slope near the resonant position and thus shows a wave traveling to the resonant position but not beyond . for @xmath38 the slope of",
    "the phase remains almost constant , corresponding to a wave traveling beyond the characteristic place . ]    in accordance with the theory of critical - layer absorption  @xcite , in regime i the traveling wave produced by a pure - tone stimulus peaks at the characteristic place and sharply decreases beyond that point ( fig .",
    "the characteristic behavior of critical - layer absorption  decrease of the traveling wave s speed and wavelength near the characteristic place  appears in the phase behavior as an increase of the slope ( fig .",
    "active hair - bundle motility amplifies the peak displacement .",
    "a strong compressive nonlinearity arises because amplification by active hair - bundle motility both increases the hair - bundle and basilar - membrane motion per unit pressure difference and enhances the amplitude of the pressure wave itself ( fig .",
    "the combination of the two effects yields a compressive nonlinearity that extends over a significantly broader range of sound intensities than the nonlinearity in hair - bundle motion itself .    in regime",
    "ii electromotility influences the micromechanics and causes hair - bundle displacement to exceed basilar - membrane displacement .",
    "the theory of critical - layer absorption still applies .",
    "the basilar - membrane tuning curves , phase behavior , and nonlinearity consequently parallel those in regime i.    in regime iii the ratchet mechanism leads to very different behavior .",
    "sound evokes a low - frequency pressure wave that traverses the entire cochlea , evoking only a small basilar - membrane displacement throughout , for the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane is higher everywhere ( fig .",
    "3b ) . at the characteristic place",
    ", however , the hair bundles exhibit an independent resonance amplified through active hair - bundle motility and facilitated by the unidirectional coupling provided by electromotility .",
    "the hair - bundle displacement there can exceed the basilar - membrane response by orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "in further contrast to the theory of critical - layer absorption , the traveling wave does not slow and its wavelength does not vanish at the characteristic place , for the basilar membrane does not resonate .",
    "this becomes apparent in the behavior of the traveling wave s phase , whose slope remains low and nearly constant across the characteristic place ( fig .",
    "the phase behavior also confirms that the wave reaches the helicotrema . because amplification through the ratchet mechanism does not act on the basilar membrane , the latter exhibits approximately linear behavior ( fig .",
    "the pressure wave is therefore unaffected by the active process .",
    "hair - bundle displacement is amplified and exhibits a moderate compressive nonlinearity ( fig .",
    "3c ) .       corresponding to the resonant frequency of the hair - bundle complex .",
    "when tuning curves are rescaled such that the frequency is measured in octaves relative to the characteristic frequency @xmath39 and the threshold is measured relative to that at the characteristic frequency , characteristic shape changes are seen to occur between curves of different characteristic frequencies .",
    "( b ) tuning curves for high characteristic frequencies , above @xmath32 , fall onto a universal curve that exhibits the strongly asymmetric form and high - frequency cutoff characteristic of a peaked traveling wave .",
    "( c ) as the characteristic frequency declines from @xmath32 to @xmath33 , the left limb falls ( arrow ) , indicating the emerging influence of electromotility and the ratchet mechanism .",
    "( d ) as the characteristic frequency diminishes below @xmath33 , the right limb falls steeply ( arrow ) , pointing to the breakdown of the peaked - wave mechanism and the dominance of ratchet amplification .",
    "]    strong support for the proposed model comes from studies of threshold tuning curves for auditory - nerve fibers  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements have shown characteristic shape changes occurring around the crossover frequencies @xmath32 and @xmath33  @xcite . to compare these data to our model , we have computed tuning curves and  despite their complexity and the simplicity of our model",
    " found striking agreement with the measurements ( fig .",
    "high - frequency fibers , those tuned above @xmath32 , display the strongly asymmetric shape characteristic of critical - layer absorption . moreover , they fall onto a universal curve when the frequency and threshold are measured relative to the values at the characteristic frequency .",
    "this accords with experimental findings and the scaling symmetry of the peaked traveling - wave mechanism  @xcite . for intermediate characteristic frequencies between @xmath33 and @xmath32 ,",
    "the scaling law is violated as the ratchet mechanism starts to influence the micromechanics , causing the left limb of the threshold tuning curves to fall as the characteristic frequency decreases  @xcite .",
    "a second violation of the scaling arises for characteristic frequencies below @xmath33 , for which the right limb falls . also observed experimentally  @xcite , this second violation of scaling indicates a breakdown of critical - layer absorption , which predicts a steep increase for threshold tuning curves at frequencies above the characteristic frequency .",
    "the classical theory of cochlear mechanics assumes that the basilar membrane resonates at a characteristic place for each frequency in the auditory range .",
    "the resulting mechanism of critical - layer absorption is characterized by ( _ i _ ) strongly asymmetric , scale - invariant tuning curves with steep high - frequency cutoffs , ( _ ii _ ) an increasing slope of the traveling wave s phase upon approaching the characteristic place , ( _ iii _ ) basilar - membrane displacement similar to hair - bundle displacement , and ( _ iv _ ) pronounced compressive nonlinearity at the characteristic frequency .",
    "this picture is consistent with diverse experimental findings from the cochlear base , including direct measurements of basilar - membrane motion and studies of threshold tuning curves for auditory - nerve fibers .",
    "however , as summarized in the introduction , experimental results from the cochlea s apex are in qualitative disagreement with the first , second , and fourth characteristics .    here",
    "we have proposed a concept for low - frequency hearing that employs a ratchet mechanism involving the interplay of active hair - bundle motility and electromotility . whereas sound - evoked forces displace the basilar membrane and the hair bundles , the active forces within the hair bundle can decouple from the basilar membrane through appropriate elongation and contraction of ohcs .",
    "this mechanism allows hair bundles to resonate independently of the basilar membrane and thus explains how the ear s hearing range can extend to values well below the resonant frequency of the basilar membrane .",
    "we have shown that amplification by the ratchet mechanism leads to characteristic behavior that is distinct from that associated with critical - layer absorption : it exhibits ( _ i@xmath40 _ ) approximately symmetric tuning curves that display no sharp high - frequency cutoff , ( _ ii_@xmath40 ) a constant slope of the traveling wave s phase across the characteristic place , ( _ iii_@xmath40 ) tuned hair - bundle displacement that exceeds the untuned basilar - membrane displacement by orders of magnitude at resonance , and ( _ iv_@xmath40 ) approximately linear basilar - membrane displacement and only moderate compressive nonlinearity in hair - bundle motion at the characteristic frequency .",
    "the proposed model yields the classical theory of critical - layer absorption for high - frequency sounds ( figs .  1b ,  3 and  4a ) .",
    "experiments in the base have confirmed ( _ i _ ) the asymmetric form of tuning curves  @xcite , ( _ ii _ ) the increasing slope of the phase  @xcite , and ( _ iv _ ) the strong compressive nonlinearity  @xcite . owing to difficulties in accessing the motion of the organ of corti at the base ,",
    "the relation ( _ iii _ ) of hair - bundle motion to basilar - membrane motion has not yet been measured there .    because the membrane time constant of ohcs is expected to limit the operation of electromotility to low frequencies  @xcite ,",
    "we have chosen in our model to consider only active hair - bundle motility in the basal part of the cochlea .",
    "however , studies in prestin knockout mice suggest that electromotility is necessary for high - frequency amplification  @xcite .",
    "electromotility near the base may adjust the operating point of the hair - bundle motor on a time - scale slower than the period of oscillation or provide a fast electrical signal in the form of membrane - potential change upon mechanical stimulation .",
    "our theory accounts for a number of unexplained results from the cochlear apex .",
    "experiments have measured ( _ i_@xmath40 ) approximately symmetric tuning curves without sharp high - frequency cutoffs of tectorial - membrane and therefore hair - bundle displacement  @xcite . in our model",
    "the approximate symmetry arises naturally , for it reflects the resonance of the hair bundles , reticular lamina , and tectorial membrane independently of resonance by the basilar membrane ( figs .",
    "1c and 3c , d ) .",
    "experiments have consistently reported ( _ ii_@xmath40 ) a constant phase slope across the characteristic place  @xcite .",
    "this feature emerges in our model ( fig .",
    "3d ) because the basilar membrane is untuned at low frequencies and the pressure wave therefore reaches the helicotrema .",
    "there remains a controversy about the existence of nonlinearity at the cochlear apex ( reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : although some investigators have found no nonlinearites  @xcite , others have reported a small compressive  @xcite or expansive nonlinearity  @xcite . however , all agree about ( _ iv_@xmath40 ) the absence of a strong compressive nonlinearity .",
    "the cochlear apex allows observation of different parts of the organ of corti  such as the tectorial membrane and hensen s cells as well as the basilar membrane  and thus permits tests of characteristic ( _ iii_@xmath40 ) of our model .",
    "experiments on a temporal - bone preparation  @xcite have shown that vibrations of the reticular lamina and tectorial membrane are orders of magnitude larger than the basilar - membrane displacement at the characteristic place .",
    "these findings are in perfect agreement with our theory .",
    "however , the in vitro experiments have been criticized for an uncertainty about which constituents of the organ of corti were measured  @xcite and are in contradiction with studies using other preparations  @xcite .",
    "definite conclusions must therefore be postponed until further experimental results become available .",
    "perhaps the most reliable comparison of our model to experimental measurements comes through tuning curves of auditory - nerve fibers , which yield information about cochlear mechanics that is least disturbed by experimental intervention and represent responses from the whole length of the cochlea .",
    "these tuning curves exhibit progressive shape changes from ( _ i _ ) the strongly asymmetric form typical of high - frequency fibers to ( _ i_@xmath40 ) the nearly symmetric form found for low - frequency fibers  @xcite .",
    "our modeled responses of tuning curves of auditory - nerve fibers exhibit the same shape changes ( fig .",
    "4 ) , thus providing a conceptual explanation for the three distinct cochlear regimes .",
    "our theory yields experimentally testable predictions based on the characteristics ( _ i_@xmath40)-(_iv_@xmath40 ) . as discussed above , ( _ i_@xmath40 )",
    "the approximately symmetric tuning curves as well as ( _ ii_@xmath40 ) the constant phase slope have already been observed .",
    "in contrast , characteristic ( _ iii_@xmath40 ) , which predicts hair - bundle motion that exceeds the basilar - membrane motion at the characteristic frequency by orders of magnitude , remains controversial .",
    "future experiments are therefore required to test this prediction .",
    "such studies should also determine whether , as our theory implies , the complex formed by the hair bundles , reticular lamina , and tectorial membrane exhibits a resonance independent of the basilar membrane , whose response is untuned .",
    "a further test is feasible through experimental studies of the nonlinear behavior at the apex , for which our theory predicts ( _ iv_@xmath40 ) a moderate compressive nonlinearity in hair - bundle motion , and therefore in tectorial - membrane motion , but no more than a weak nonlinearity in the basilar membrane s response .",
    "finally , and beyond the theory presented in this article , the ratchet mechanism should allow for traveling waves in the tectorial membrane  @xcite that are unidirectionally coupled to basilar - membrane waves .",
    "the ratchet mechanism constitutes a general design principle for mechanical amplification whereby the output does not feed back onto the input . in this way it represents a mechanical analogue of the operational amplifier from electrical engineering  @xcite .",
    "although the current technology of signal detectors such as microphones relies on electrical amplification , mechanical amplification could improve signal - to - noise ratios and thereby greatly advance sensitivity and detection of weak signals .",
    "the ratchet mechanism thus opens a path for implementing controlled mechanical amplification in engineering applications .",
    "by combining continuity equations and fluid - momentum equations , we describe the cochlea s hydrodynamics with the partial differential equation @xmath41 here @xmath42 denotes the density of liquid in the cochlea , @xmath43 the length of the cochlea , @xmath44 the height of the scalae , and @xmath45 and @xmath0 respectively the pressure across and the displacement of the basilar membrane at position @xmath46 and time @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath48 accounts for friction due to fluid motion .",
    "position is measured in units of the cochlear length , such that @xmath49 corresponds to the basal and @xmath50 to the apical end .",

    "because the two scalae communicate at the helicotrema , the pressure difference between them vanishes at the apical end of the cochlea .",
    "tuning curves of auditory - nerve fibers are computed by assuming that the hearing threshold corresponds to a root - mean - square deflection of the hair bundles of ihcs by @xmath54 nm .",

    "<S> the second key uncertainty is the nature of the active process that operates in the mammalian cochlea . </S>",
