    "the @xmath0-process refers to neutron captures being @xmath5low compared to subsequent beta decays , typically with @xmath6  @xmath7 . in this approximation , and assuming no branchings , the equation governing the abundance @xmath8 of the ( stable ) isobar of mass @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the neutron number density and @xmath12 is the thermally averaged neutron - capture cross - section for the isobar of mass a. it is common to write @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the thermal velocity of the neutrons and @xmath16 is an appropriate average cross - section .",
    "it is useful to define the neutron exposure by @xmath17 and thus we get @xmath18 in a steady - state @xmath19 and @xmath20 is constant .",
    "the solar system distribution does show @xmath21 roughly constant when away from the isobars of magic neutron number ( these produce bottle - necks in the distribution due to their low cross - section ) .",
    "clayton et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a single neutron exposure @xmath22 could not reproduce the solar system distribution , and we historically recognise three distinct components :    1 .",
    "_ weak component : _  producing most of the @xmath0-isotopes with @xmath23 , from fe to sr ; 2 .   _ main component : _  responsible for the @xmath0-isotopes from @xmath24 , from sr to pb ; 3 .",
    "_ strong component : _  devised primarily to produce @xmath25pb in the solar system .    to reproduce the solar system distribution we add a mix of these three components .",
    "the weak component is believed to come from central he burning in massive stars , where the neutron source is 22(@xmath26n ) .",
    "the main component is associated with agb stars , and the strong component is now associated with metal - poor agb stars .",
    "there is strong evidence that most giant stars enriched in @xmath0-process elements have masses around @xmath28 . in these stars",
    "the neutron source is @xmath2916 , as discussed in the next section .",
    "but for intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath30 ) the neutron source is thought to be 22 .    in many ways ,",
    "the 22 source is the simplest to activate .",
    "the h - shell burns cno into 14 which can then capture two alpha - particles during the next thermal pulse to produce 22 in the flash - driven convective pocket .",
    "if the peak temperature in this pocket exceeds @xmath31 million  k then neutrons are released by 22@xmath29 . however , a few things work against the 22 source being important for the @xmath0-process .",
    "firstly there is the fact that the extent in mass of the flash - driven convective zone decreases as the stellar mass increases , from about 0.03@xmath1 ( in low mass stars ) to below 0.005@xmath1 for intermediate masses .",
    "thus , the number of seeds and neutrons is small , so that not much processing can occur . secondly , to make the situation worse , the duration in time of the pocket also decreases with mass , from about 300y to 20y , giving less time for the neutrons to be produced .",
    "this is at least partly offset by the fact that the temperature of the shell increases with mass , making more neutrons available at higher masses .",
    "thirdly , the small convective zone of enriched @xmath0-process elements is then diluted in a large envelope prior to its ejection into the interstellar medium via the stellar wind . and finally , the shape of the imf also works against intermediate mass stars being an important site for the @xmath0-process . nevertheless , a quantitative estimate of their importance is not available at present , and would be useful .",
    "further , it is possible that the  source could be active in these stars in addition to the 22 source .",
    "it would also suffer from the extreme closeness of the h and he shells in intermediate - mass stars , and hence , is unlikely to be important . but a quantitative analysis is not yet available .",
    "the basic mechanism of the  source is fairly simple , and is shown in figure  [ c13schematic ] .",
    "some protons are mixed below the hydrogen - rich envelope at the time that dredge - up ceases .",
    "this region is comprised of about 25%  12  and 75% 4  ( by mass ) . the protons are captured by the abundant 12  nuclei to form  and 14 .",
    "when the star contracts again , the h shell reignites and the temperature in the  pocket approaches 100 million  k where the timescale for @xmath32-capture decreases below the time between pulses @xcite .",
    "hence , neutrons are released within the pocket at quite low neutron densities .",
    "these neutrons are captured _ in situ _ by fe and heavy species to produce the @xmath0-process isotopes . at the next pulse this @xmath0-process rich shell",
    "is ingested by the convective pocket .",
    "in addition , even in low mass stars there might be a brief activation of the 22  source at the peak of the pulse .",
    "this much is relatively clear .",
    "the details , however , are another matter .",
    "= 0.9      the largest unknown in the scenario described above is the mechanism which causes the protons to be mixed into the carbon - enriched region .",
    "we will discuss four mechanism which have been suggested and explored .",
    "the first calculation which showed the activation of the   source was @xcite,@xcite .",
    "they found that , following a pulse , the expansion of the star caused some recombination of fully ionized carbon atoms at the very bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "this caused a dramatic change in the opacity , and a small semiconvective region developed at the bottom of the formally convective envelope .",
    "this mixed some protons down and produced a thin region , a few @xmath33 , containing a mass fraction of a few @xmath34 in .there is also a small 14  pocket just atop the  pocket ; this region plays little role in the subsequent @xmath0-processing ( 14 is a neutron poison ) .",
    "this mechanism was not found to occur very often in detailed model calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that simple 1d convective models often show convergence problems at the bottom of the convective zone during dredge - up ( @xcite ) is , we believe , an indication that the models are inadequate in this region .",
    "semiconvection may yet be the main mechanism for activating the  source .",
    "an obvious possible mechanism for mixing beyond a formal convective boundary is overshooting .",
    "note that `` overshooting '' usually refers to mixing beyond a supposed convective - radiative boundary , which is usually determined by the schwarzschild or ledoux criterion . in this case",
    "we do not mean homogeneous mixing , or a simple extension of the convective zone into the radiative zone .",
    "rather , for the  source to be activated we must mix a relatively small number of protons into the carbon - enriched zone .    stimulated by the 2d hydrodynamic convective models of @xcite which showed such partially mixed zones , @xcite introduced an exponential decay in the convective velocity .",
    "this produces the partial mixing required by the  source .",
    "it also , unfortunately , introduces parameters associated with the overshooting which determine the size of the  pocket .",
    "a recent suggestion by @xcite is that gravity waves at the bottom of the convective envelope can produce partial mixing beyond the convective boundary . for reasonable assumptions",
    "the resultant  pocket is about the size required to match observed abundances .      in stellar models computed with rotation , during the agb phase a large angular velocity gradient forms , just after the occurrence of the third dredge - up , at the interface between the faster - rotating core and the slower - rotating envelope .",
    "a zone where partial mixing of protons and @xmath35c is thus generated at the core / envelope interface because of shear mixing . as with the other types of mechanism for the production of the @xmath2c pocket , the proton profile is continuous in the region so that a @xmath2c pocket is created where the ratio of the number of protons to @xmath35c is below unity , and an adjacent @xmath36n pocket is created where the ratio of protons to @xmath35c is above unity .",
    "however , while with the other types of mechanism these two pockets keep separated during the neutron release by @xmath2c(@xmath32,n)@xmath4o in the interpulse period , in the rotating models shear mixing persists throughout the interpulse period because the steep angular velocity gradient remains at the mass coordinate of the pocket formation .",
    "consequently , a large amount of @xmath36n is mixed down into the @xmath2c - rich region @xcite .",
    "these @xmath36n nuclei act as a strong neutron poison during the @xmath0-process because of the relatively high cross section of the @xmath36n(n , p)@xmath36c reaction .",
    "the last measurement of this reaction gave 2.04 @xmath37 0.16 mbarn at 24.5 kev @xcite confirming previous calculations @xcite and measurements @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the @xmath0-process is completely inhibited in models that include rotation @xcite .",
    "this result has been produced for a model of 3 @xmath38 with initial surface rotation velocity of 250 km s@xmath39 , but also confirmed for lower initial velocities .",
    "since all stars rotate , this is a major problem for the current models !",
    "one should also consider though that magnetic fields are generated by rotation , but have not been included in the computations of agb stars so far and could represent a way to `` save the @xmath0-process '' .",
    "magnetic fields , in fact , could enhance the coupling of core and envelope thus decelerating the core and reducing the strength of the rotational shear mixing @xcite .",
    "the problem is open and requires further exploration .",
    "if the effect of rotation could be reduced , then a spread of neutron exposures could be produced by different amount of @xmath36n mixed into the @xmath2c pocket as a result of a spread of rotational mixing coefficients @xcite .",
    "then , different neutron exposures result in different final @xmath0-process abundance distributions @xcite . as we describe below in more detail ,",
    "several types of observational constraints seem to require such a spread of efficiencies to occur :    1 .   the spectroscopic observations of the @xmath0-element distributions in agb and post - agb stars of different metallicities , 2 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of lead in stars of low metallicity , 3 .   the isotopic composition of single presolar silicon carbide grains from carbon stars .    in summary ,",
    "a possible scenario within the current models is that the spread of efficiencies in the @xmath2c neutron source required by the observations is somewhat related to the effect of rotation and magnetic fields in stars , even through more defined conclusions will be set only via much future detailed work .",
    "the latest generation of @xmath0-process models are based on agb stellar structure computed by evolutionary codes with the artificial introduction of a parametrized @xmath2c pocket @xcite .",
    "the two phases of neutron - capture processes experienced by the intershell material during an interpulse - pulse period can be summarised as following .",
    "the @xmath2c source .",
    ": :    after less than a few thousand years from the occurrence of proton    diffusion into the intershell at the end of dredge - up , the    @xmath2c pocket is formed .",
    "the    @xmath2c(@xmath32,n)@xmath4o    reaction is activated during the interpulse phase in radiative    conditions at low temperature , @xmath40 k ,    and all the @xmath2c is typically consumed before the end    of the interpulse period @xcite .",
    "this is the main site for the    @xmath0-process .",
    "the neutron flux lasts typically 10,000 yr    and can produce very high neutron exposures , up to @xmath41    0.5 mb@xmath39 in solar - metallicity stars , but with low    neutron density values , only up to about @xmath42    n/@xmath43 ( in solar - metallicity stars ) . the @xmath27ne source .",
    ": :    at the end of the interpulse the @xmath2c pocket is    engulfed by the following convective pulse and thus mixed with    intershell material from the previous convective pulse and the ashes    from the h - burning shell . in the convective pulse ,",
    "the    @xmath27ne(@xmath32,n)@xmath44 mg    reaction is marginally activated at temperatures    @xmath45 k , and a second neutron flux    occurs , whose strength depends on the temperature at the base of the    convective pulse .",
    "a large amount of @xmath27ne is present    in the convective pulse as a product of double    @xmath32-captures starting on the abundant    @xmath36n from the h - burning ashes .",
    "this second neutron    burst is opposite in features to that in the @xmath2c    pocket : it occurs on a timescale of a few years and it produces    typically very low neutron exposures , of the order of    @xmath46 mb@xmath39 in solar metallicity    stars , with a high - peaked neutron density , up to @xmath47    n/@xmath43 , in solar - metallicity stars .",
    "this neutron burst    does not contribute much to the overall production of @xmath0    elements , however it has a large effect on the final abundances of    isotopes connected to branching points .",
    "after each thermal pulse the @xmath0-process rich material from the he intershell is dredged up to the envelope by the next dredge - up event .",
    "this cycle is repeated over all thermal pulses with dredge - up and the heavy element composition of the envelope throughout the agb phase is changed .      as first observed by @xcite : `` take the stellar structure to be independent of z , as is the intershell @xmath35c content because it is manufactured by the burning within the star .",
    "thus the neutron source is in this case independent of the initial metallicity , but the major absorbers ( @xmath27ne + fe ) are metallicity dependent [ ... ] the neutron density is proportional to z@xmath39 .",
    "that is , _ more metal - poor stars produce larger neutron fluences ! _ '' current models with primary @xmath2c as the main source do indeed produce heavier and heavier elements at lower and lower z , until mostly pb is produced .",
    "this result is independent of the uncertainties associated with the formation of the @xmath2c pocket , if we assume that the mechanism that generates the proton diffusion in the intershell always produces a primary @xmath2c neutron source in stars of different metallicities .",
    "this assumption could appear rather bold , given the poor knowledge of this mechanism .",
    "however , current models including this assumption seem to work quite well in explaining major observational features .",
    "hence , it may actually turn out that this assumption _ should _ be verified by models for the formation of the @xmath2c source .    working within this hypothesis ,",
    "the following results are obtained when we keep fixed the amount of the @xmath2c neutron source while changing the initial metallicity of the star . at metallicities close to solar , sr - peak elements are produced . at metallicities about 1/4 of solar ba - peak elements",
    "are produced , while at lower metallicities pb is produced ( see figures 1 and 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the current model predictions well match the general features of the observed distribution of heavy elements in agb stars of different metallicities .",
    "however , a spread in the efficiency of the neutron flux in the @xmath2c pocket has to be introduced at each metallicity to cover the spread in the distribution shown by the observational data @xcite .",
    "this spread of efficiencies in the neutron flux produced in the @xmath2c pocket is represented by choices of the @xmath2c efficiencies ranging from the maximum neutron exposure allowed by the presence of the @xmath36n poison to lower values down to zero .",
    "for example , at solar metallicity @xmath48 0.5 mb@xmath39 .",
    "as discussed above , this spread toward neutron exposures lower than predicted can be produced by different efficiency in the mixing of @xmath36n produced in the upper region of the partial mixing zone down to the @xmath2c - rich region .",
    "the pb overabundances recently observed in stars of low metallicity represent another important indication that the @xmath2c neutron source is in fact of primary nature , as the production of pb in these stars was predicted by the current models @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the pb overabundances and the ratio pb / ce show a spread of efficiencies at any given metallicity @xcite requiring again a spread of efficiency of the @xmath2c neutron source at any metallicity .",
    "the consequences of applying the recent @xmath0-process models to the chemical evolution of heavy elements in the galaxy have been presented in a series of paper by travaglio , and collaborators .",
    "the main conclusions are :    * the galactic abundance of ba - peak elements is explained by @xmath0- and @xmath49-processes with a contribution of 80% to solar ba from the @xmath0-process in agb stars of metallicity @xmath41 1/4 of solar @xcite . * the galactic abundance of pb",
    "is explained by @xmath0- and @xmath49-processes with a contribution of 90% to the solar abundance of pb from the @xmath0-process in agb stars of metallicity @xmath41 1/10 of solar @xcite .",
    "the classical _ strong component _ is now incorporated in the framework of the @xmath0-process in agb stars .",
    "* elements belonging to the sr peak instead appear * not * to be explained by the @xmath0- and @xmath49-processes ! a special primary component from massive stars is needed to match observations of the light @xmath0-process elements at low metallicity .",
    "about 70% of solar sr comes from the @xmath0-process in agb stars of metallicity @xmath41 1/2 solar @xcite .",
    "new constraints on the @xmath0-process in agb stars come from meteoritic silicon carbide ( sic ) grains that formed in the expanding envelopes of carbon stars and contain trace amounts of heavy elements showing the signature of the @xmath0-process .",
    "high - sensitivity laboratory measurements of the isotopic composition of trace heavy elements in single sic of the size of micrometers provide constraints of precision never achieved before on models of the @xmath0-process and on neutron - capture cross sections .",
    "for example , the @xmath50zr/@xmath51zr ratio is very sensitive to the nucleosynthesis in the convective pulse , which in turn depends on the still uncertain @xmath27ne(@xmath52)@xmath44 mg reaction rate and the temperature at the base of the convective instability .",
    "this is because @xmath50zr is produced through a branching at @xmath53zr during the neutron flux of high peak neutron density released by the @xmath27ne(@xmath52)@xmath44 mg reaction , while @xmath51zr is produced during the main neutron flux released by the @xmath2c(@xmath52)@xmath4o reaction .",
    "data from single sic grains always show deficits in the @xmath50zr/@xmath51zr ratio with respect to solar and point to a marginal activation of the @xmath27ne neutron source @xcite , thus excluding intermediate - mass agb stars as the parent stars of the grains , as well as the nacre upper limit of the @xmath27ne(@xmath52)@xmath44 mg reaction as the correct value for this reaction .",
    "four presolar sic grains show extreme deficits in the @xmath50zr/@xmath51zr ratios and are still unmatched by any of the current models .",
    "the @xmath54zr/@xmath51zr ratios on the other hand involve nuclei near closed neutron shells and thus depend on the main neutron exposure released by the @xmath2c neutron source .",
    "the observed values for these ratios in single sic grains are recovered by considering ( again ! ) a spread of efficiencies in the neutron flux produced by the @xmath2c source .",
    "the precision with which presolar grain data are obtained also stimulates new measurements of neutron - capture cross sections ( koehler , p. , these proceedings ) .",
    "the laboratory techniques for the analysis of presolar grains are expanding rapidly , especially with the recent introduction of new instruments for material analysis targeted at the study of presolar grains : the nanosims , a secondary ionization mass spectrometer with a primary ion beam of the size of nanometers @xcite and the rims technique , resonant ionization mass spectrometry combined to a laser - extraction technique @xcite .",
    "the current and future opportunities of constraining @xmath0-process models using laboratory data from the analysis of presolar grains are vast and compelling .",
    "some details of the @xmath0-process in agb stars seem now to be well understood , and yet others remain a mystery .",
    "it is rather unsatisfactory that we still do not know the mechanism(s ) responsible for the production of the  pocket . as a consequence we do not know.how",
    "this might vary with stellar parameters , although there are clearly indications from observations that there are variations from star to star . nevertheless , with simultaneous attacks on the problem coming from spectroscopy , grain analysis and advanced computer modelling , we may be optimistic that we will yet overcome our current limitations .",
