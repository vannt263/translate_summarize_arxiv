    "in recent years , there is much interest in qgp phase diagram in @xmath5 plane , @xmath6 the temperature and @xmath7 the baryonic chemical potential @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "presently , only one point in the phase diagram is known from lattice qcd simulations , at @xmath80 , the qcd transition is a cross over @xcite at ( pseudo ) critical temperature @xmath9157 ( 3)(3 ) mev @xcite . from theoretical considerations ,",
    "qcd phase transition is expected to be 1st order in baryon dense matter .",
    "one then expects a qcd critical end point ( cep ) , where the transition changes from 1st order to cross - over . to access the qcd phase diagram and cep ,",
    "systematic study of nuclear collisions , as a function of collision energy , has been planned at fair @xcite in the energy range @xmath10=5 - 40 gev .    at finite baryon density , fermion determinant is complex and standard technique of monte - carlo importance sampling fails .",
    "several techniques have been suggested to circumvent the problem , ( i ) reweighting @xcite,@xcite , ( ii ) analytical continuation of imaginary chemical potential @xcite , @xcite and ( iii)taylor expansion @xcite,@xcite .",
    "these methods has been used to locate the phase boundary in @xmath5 plane .",
    "the calculations suggest that the curvature parameter ( @xmath3 ) in the expansion ,    @xmath11    is small @xcite . as an example , in fig.[f1 ] , qcd phase diagram obtained in the analytical continuation method @xcite ( the filled circles ) and in taylor expansion @xcite of ( chiral ) are shown .",
    "both the methods gives nearly identical phase diagram for @xmath12 , curvature parameter is small , @xmath13 . at larger @xmath7 ,",
    "they differ marginally . for comparison , in fig.[f1 ] , chemical freeze - out curve @xcite,@xcite , obtained in statistical model analysis of particle ratios are shown ( the red line ) .",
    "curvature of the chemical freeze - out curve is factor of 4 larger than the curvature in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "small curvature of the qcd critical line , compared to the chemical freeze - out is interesting .",
    "experimental signal of critical end point will get diluted as the deconfined medium produced at the critical end point will evolve longer to reach chemical freeze - out .",
    "fluid will have more time to washout any signature of cep .    in the present letter",
    ", we obtain the curvature parameter @xmath3 by analysing experimental data on @xmath0 suppression .",
    "existing data in @xmath14=17.3 gev pb+pb and @xmath14=200 gev au+au collisions , constrain the curvature parameter within a narrow range , @xmath15 .",
    "it is factor of @xmath4 3 larger than in the lattice qcd calculations . to our knowledge , this is the first attempt to obtain qcd critical line from experiment data .",
    "in a deconfined medium ( qgp ) , inter - quark ( color ) potential is screened .",
    "the screening increases with temperature and above a certain temperature , the potential is too weak to bind charm and anti - charm quarks into a bound state .",
    "charmonium states are then suppressed . matsui and",
    "satz @xcite , first predicted the phenomena . over the years , in several experiments , @xmath0 yield in heavy ion collisions has been measured .",
    "measurements at sps ( @xmath1=17.3 gev ) and rhic ( @xmath1=200 gev ) energy validate matsui and satz s predictions .    to mimic the onset of deconfining phase transition above a critical energy density and subsequent melting of @xmath0 s ,",
    "qgp motivated threshold model was proposed in @xcite . in the threshold model , @xmath0 suppression",
    "is linked with the local transverse density . if the local transverse density , at the point where @xmath0 is formed , exceed a critical or threshold value , @xmath0 s are melted . in the present paper ,",
    "we use a variant of the threshold model , if the local temperature of the fluid , exceed a threshold value @xmath16 , @xmath0 s are melted .",
    "approximately 30 - 40% of observed @xmath0 s are from feed - down decay of the higher states , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "the model is also a static model .",
    "it neglect the possibility that @xmath0 s , initially produced in a cold region and survived , at a later time can drift into a hotter region and get melted .",
    "such possibilities , if accounted for would reduce the survival probability . consequently , the present model give a lower limit of curvature parameter @xmath3 .",
