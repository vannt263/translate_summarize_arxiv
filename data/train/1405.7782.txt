    "mass outflows are ubiquitous and play an essential role in the process of star formation @xcite .",
    "the young stellar objects ( ysos ) eject material while they are gathering mass through an accretion disk from the surroundings , which is proved to be an important way to transfer the excessive angular momentum from star - forming cores to the ambient interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "outflows have been observed at different wavelengths such as herbig - haro ( hh ) objects in the visual , molecular hydrogen emission line objects ( mhos ) at 2.12 , and co molecular outflows in the millimeter wavelength .",
    "hh objects are produced from the interaction of faster gas clumps with the slower ones that are ejected previously or the interaction of the supersonic gas ejected from ysos with the ambient interstellar medium @xcite . during the cooling process of the shocked gas",
    ", hh objects can exhibit strong forbidden lines such as [ sii ] @xmath0 6717/6731 @xcite .",
    "these lines are usually stronger than those in photo - ionized regions such as hii regions or planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is effective and efficient to survey the star forming regions using the [ sii ] @xmath0 6717/6731 narrowband together with a neighboring broadband for identifying hh objects .",
    "the typical velocity of hh objects is about 100 - 300 km s@xmath2 and their typical dynamical age is about 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4yr @xcite .",
    "therefore , hh objects are good tracers of recent star formation .",
    "mass outflows from ysos are believed to be associated with the accretion process of protostars and to be driven magnetocentrifugally from open field lines anchored on rapidly rotating circumstellar disks @xcite .",
    "the identification of hh objects can provide hints for the locations of protostars , especially for the ones that are deeply embedded in the cloud cores .",
    "for example , a highly collimated jet usually points to its driving source and a pair of counterflows usually indicates that a yso should lie between them .",
    "a wide - field survey of hh objects toward an entire star forming region can reveal the star formation activity in the star forming region .",
    "taking advantage of the large field of view provided by mosaic ccds , we have conducted a series of surveys with the aim to investigate the star formation activity in nearby star forming regions .",
    "our surveys have covered the r cra , cha i , lupus i , lupus iii and vela c star forming regions . in this paper , we report the results from our survey toward the vela c molecular cloud . our results from other surveys can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    shocked gas in outflows",
    "has also abundant atomic and molecular hydrogen line emission in the mid - infrared .",
    "@xcite obtained the infrared spectra from 2.4  to 45  toward the brightest h@xmath5 emission peak of the orion omc-1 outflow using the short - wavelength - spectrometer on the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and detected a wealth of emission and absorption features dominated by @xmath650 h@xmath5 ro - vibrational and pure rotational lines reaching from h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(1 ) to 0 - 0 s(25 ) .",
    "surveys toward star - forming regions using the infrared array camera ( irac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) present an opportunity for the investigation of mid - infrared outflows .",
    "the irac 4.5  band contains h@xmath5 ( @xmath7 = 0 - 0 , s(9 , 10 , 11 ) ) lines and co ( @xmath7 = 1 - 0 ) band heads @xcite and has proved an effective tool for exhibiting the mid - infrared emission from outflows @xcite . some authors began to use the extended excessive emission at 4.5  to identify the mid - infrared outflows @xcite .",
    "we also identified about 40 extended green objects ( egos ) as the mid - infrared outflows in ophiuchus based on the extended excessive emission at 4.5  using the _ spitzer _ archive data from _",
    "c2d _ legacy program @xcite and we proposed the excessive emission at 4.5  as a powerful tool to search and investigate the mid - infrared outflows .",
    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) launched on december 14 , 2009 began its survey observations on january 7 , 2010 .",
    "wise surveyed the entire sky in the 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  mid - infrared bandpasses ( w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 ) with a 40 cm telescope equipped with a camera containing four mid - infrared detectors that simultaneously imaged the same 47@xmath847  field - of - view on the sky .",
    "the spatial resolutions are 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 12  in the four bands ( w1-w4 ) , respectively .",
    "the sensitivity of wise varies with position on the sky and improves toward ecliptic poles due to systematic changes in the depth of coverage and the zodiacal foreground emission .",
    "the estimated allwise sensitivities for low coverage sky away from the galactic plane are about 0.054 , 0.071 , 0.73 , and 5 mjy for the four bands , respectively .",
    "wise uses similar passbands to _ spitzer _ : w1 and w2 have close correspondence to irac 1 and irac 2 while w4 compares well with mips 24 .",
    "considering the similarities of passbands between wise and _ spitzer _ , we apply the method that was suggested by @xcite to the wise data and use the wise data to investigate the mid - infrared outflows in the vela c molecular cloud , which could offer a complementary sample of outflows in the highly obscured regions of vela c.    the vela molecular ridge ( vmr ) is a large molecular cloud complex located along the galactic plane , roughly between _",

    "is a balloon - borne 2 m telescope which has three wide bands at 250 , 350 , and 500  @xcite .",
    "the blast survey toward vela covers about 50 deg@xmath1 in the vela molecular ridge .",
    "@xcite presented the results from this unbiased submillimeter galactic survey and more than 1000 compact sources have been identified .",
    "@xcite estimated the physical parameters such as temperature , mass , and luminosity for each of these sources through fitting the three blast fluxes with a single - temperature modified blackbody sed .",
    "they found that the temperatures of these blast sources are in a range of only several kelvin up to 30k .",
    "much work has been done toward vela d , including the identification of clusters and isolated protostars @xcite and the identification of jets and outflows @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that both vela c and d have recent star forming activity and the vela c is less evolved than vela d. the vela c molecular cloud is attracting an increasing interest since it was selected as target of recent surveys such as herschel and eso - laboca @xcite .",

    "@xcite and @xcite presented the herschel pacs and spire survey of the vela c. @xcite obtained the temperature map of the vela c and found that the dust temperatures in most of the vela c region are significantly lower than 30k .",
    "@xcite extracted the point sources on the herschel maps and they found that the mean temperature of protostellar sources is 12.8 k which is warmer than that for the starless sources of 10.3 k. these all suggest that the vela c molecular cloud may stay at a early evolutionary stage of star formation .    more than 80 ysos have been identified in the vela c molecular cloud through h@xmath14 imaging , near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy observations @xcite .",
    "the outflows detected in vela c include a confirmed co molecular outflow @xcite and six hh objects , i.e. , hh 73 - 75 , hh 133 , and hh 1042 - 1043 . among them , hh 75 and hh 133 are located in the northeast of vela c , which is outside the region harboring the dense c@xmath13o clumps .",

    "the observations were conducted on 2007 february 24 - 28 and march 01 - 02 using the european southern observatory max planck gesellschaft ( eso mpg ) 2.2 m telescope at la silla .",
    "the telescope is equipped with the wide field imager ( wfi ) camera which is a mosaic of eight 2k@xmath84k ccds with narrow interchip gaps ( the filling factor is 95.9% ; @xcite ) . with a plate scale of 0238 pixel@xmath2 ,",

    "we define an elliptic aperture around each hh feature in the continuum - subtracted [ sii ] images based on the morphology and surface brightness distribution of the hh feature .",
    "the principle for the aperture definition is to ensure that no stars are included in the aperture and the aperture contains as little area that seems to be of no excessive [ sii ] emission as possible . in the same time , we also define a circular nearby sky aperture in the emission - free region to estimate the local sky level .",
    "the elliptic apertures that we define for each hh feature are shown in figs .",

    "therefore , an accurate measurement of the total fluxes in the [ sii ] duplicate lines requires knowledge of the strength ratio between the two emission lines , which however can not be determined from our imaging data .",
    "spectroscopical observations has shown that the [ sii ] @xmath06717 to @xmath06731 line ratios for hh objects lie typically in the range of 0.6 to 1.4 @xcite . for the purpose to estimate the total fluxes in the [ sii ] @xmath0 6717/6731 lines of hh objects and for simplicity , we assume that the [ sii ] @xmath19 6717 flux is equal to the [ sii ] @xmath19 6731 flux . with this assumption and taking into account the transmission profile of the wfi [ sii ] filter , we can transform the fluxes of hh features from the units of dn to the flux units of w m@xmath20 .",

    "thus the method suggested by @xcite is also effective with the wise data and can be used to search for mid - infrared outflows .    for the vela c molecular cloud , the wise mosaics of the difference image between w1 and w2 band were displayed and visually inspected to search for mid - infrared outflows based on appearance of extended excessive emission at 4.6  ( w2 ) .",

    "but for the ego candidates without hh counterparts , only the extended objects are reserved .",
    "then the surviving ego candidates have been further confirmed as bona fide egos using the three - color images constructed with w1 ( blue ) , w2 ( green ) , and w3 ( red ) bands .",
    "secondly , reflection nebulae , pne , snrs , and hii regions may contaminate our ego sample .",
    "pne can be distinguished from egos based on their symmetrical morphology while reflection nebulae can be identified based on their extended emission in r band or k band .",
    "we have checked each ego in the dss2 red image and 2mass ks image to exclude reflection nebulae .",
    "we also searched the known snrs and hii regions in _ simbad _ database and examined egos near them .",

    "based on the source classification scheme suggested by @xcite , 56 new yso candidates are identified in vela c using the allwise source catalog , including 9 class i sources , 6  flat spectrum \" sources , 29 class ii sources , and 12 class iii sources .",
    "we also propose 4 blast @xcite sources that are associated with the wise 22  sources to be the protostellar core candidates in the vela c molecular cloud .",
    "* based on the morphologies of hh objects and egos and the locations of hh objects , egos and ysos , the possible driving sources of the hh objects and egos are discussed .",
    "we associate 12 hh objects and five egos with 10 ysos and yso candidates .",
    "the median length of these 10 outflows is 0.35pc and the distribution of jet position angles seems to be uniform .",
    "we thank the eso / mpg 2.2 m wfi group for making the observations in service mode .",
