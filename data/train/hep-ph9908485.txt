    "a dynamical description of the spectrum of the heavy flavor mesons @xmath6 has _ a priori _ to be relativistic as the confined light quarks and antiquarks have velocities close to that of light .",
    "combination of this requirement , with the nonrelativistic instantaneous aspect of the effective linear @xcite ( or near linear @xcite ) confining interaction suggests that a 3-dimensional quasipotential reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation should provide the most obvious framework for a realistic description .",
    "this is _ a fortiori _ the case as the bethe - salpeter equation with instantaneous interactions , while commonly employed , @xcite , fails to provide satisfactory results for the m1 transitions of the analogous heavy quarkonia @xcite .    among the many choices of quasipotential equations the blankenbecler - sugar equation @xcite suggests itself because of its transparent formal similarity to the nonrelativistic lippmann - schwinger equation , to which it reduces in the adiabatic limit . moreover it admits direct employment of the conventional ( relativistic ) models for the hyperfine interaction between quarks and antiquarks , as well as the linear confining interaction along with its obvious relativistic modifications .",
    "the key advantage of the blankenbecler - sugar equation over the nonrelativistic or `` relativized '' versions of the nonrelativistic wave equation is the unapproximated treatment of the relativistic two - particle kinetic energy operator of the @xmath6 system .",
    "the relativistic modifications to the interaction are in comparison modest , and may be treated in an approximate fashion , when convenient .",
    "this feature is shared with the gross @xcite reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation , which has been applied to heavy flavor mesons in ref.@xcite .",
    "given this situation , several different versions of the blankenbecler - sugar equation have been employed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we shall here use the symmetrical version of ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate both the spectra and the m1 decay widths of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons and their orbital excitations .",
    "the formalism then differs somewhat from that used to describe the @xmath6 system in refs .",
    "the main advantage of the version used here is that it leads to a lippmann - schwinger type wave - equation .",
    "it differs most obviously from that used in refs.@xcite in the appearance of the `` minimal relativity '' @xcite square root factors @xmath7 in the effective interaction potential in the wave equation .",
    "the radiative transitions of the ground state @xmath6 mesons may be described phenomenologically by effective field theory methods @xcite .",
    "a complete dynamical model is however required for any comprehensive description of the decays of the full spectrum of @xmath6 states .",
    "the static quark model is insufficient here , as it is expected to overpredict the width of the m1 transition for @xmath8 by a large factor in analogy to its large overprediction of the width for the m1 decay @xmath9 , and which is resolved only by employment of the relativistic magnetic moment operator for the heavy quarks along with the interaction current operator that is associated with the scalar confining interaction @xcite .    in comparison to heavy quarkonia",
    "the heavy - light @xmath6 mesons are more complex systems in view of the still unsettled form of the hyperfine interaction for the light quarks and concomitantly their empirically still only poorly known spectrum .",
    "while the branching ratios of the m1 decays of the charmed vector mesons are known , their still unknown total decay widths prevent an absolute empirical determination of their m1 decay widths . in spite of  and because of  this situation it remains a challenge to decode the structure and the dynamics of these systems , as this is a main key to the understanding of the nature of the confining interaction and the hyperfine interaction between constituent quarks .",
    "there are good theoretical @xcite and phenomenological @xcite reasons to expect the confining interaction to be linear with a scalar spinor structure , although mixtures of combinations of scalar and vector coupling terms continue to be employed @xcite . for",
    "the heavy light @xmath6 systems the hyperfine interaction is likely to be formed as a combination of the screened perturbative gluon exchange interaction @xcite and the direct instanton induced interaction @xcite , which share many qualitative features .",
    "the latter appears in the instanton liquid model description of the qcd vacuum @xcite , which is supported by numerical lattice calculations @xcite . in the case of",
    "heavy light quarkonia the relativistic corrections to the gluon exchange interaction cause an appreciable damping of that interaction , besides the screening of the the color hyperfine coupling strength .",
    "we here consider the m1 decay rates of the @xmath6 systems , because these are expected to be overpredicted by the static quark model , and are likely to provide decisive information on the nature of the confining interaction .",
    "because the constituent quark masses appear in different combinations in the magnetic transition operators for the different charge states of the @xmath6 mesons the m1 transition rates should also provide information on the constituent quark masses .",
    "we show that the decay rates predicted by the static quark model for the m1 transition @xmath10 is strongly reduced with ( 1 ) employment of the relativistic magnetic moment operator for the quarks in combination with ( 2 ) the interaction current , that appears if the confining interaction couples as a .",
    "this result falls in line with that for the corresponding m1 decay rate problem of heavy quarkonia @xcite . for @xmath11 systems ( i.e. systems with equal quark and anti - quark masses ) neither",
    "the gluon exchange interaction nor the instanton induced interaction gives rise two any two - body current operator with a spin - flip part .",
    "the spin - flip component of those exchange current operators that appear in the case of @xmath6 systems usually have much smaller matrix elements compared to the matrix elements of the two - body current that is associated with the scalar confining interaction .    the effective interaction potential between the heavy quark and the light antiquark is accordingly described by a scalar linear confining + one - gluon exchange interaction with a hyperfine interaction formed of the perturbative gluon exchange interaction .",
    "the parameters of this model are , to the extent possible , fixed to values obtained by lattice calculations as well as to the known part of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson spectra , and then appropriately scaled to the bottom mesons",
    ". finally the quality of the model is tested by a calculation of the spectrum and the m1 decay widths of charmonium .    with the framework of the blankenbecler - sugar equation and",
    "the @xmath6 interaction models above it is possible to obtain spectra for both charmonium and the heavy - light mesons , which agree overall with the empirical spectra , where these are known .",
    "similarly the description of the ( known ) m1 decay rates of the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 are well described .",
    "the m1 decay rates for the @xmath2 and @xmath4 mesons are predictions , as absolute empirical determination of these are yet to be made . the present result that it is possible to achieve a satisfactory description of both the spectra and m1 decay rates of heavy quarkonia and heavy light mesons differs from that of ref.@xcite .",
    "the key point here is the employment of an unapproximated quark current operator .",
    "this report falls into 7 sections .",
    "section  [ sec_bslt ] contains a description of the application of the blankenbecler ",
    "sugar equation to the @xmath6 and @xmath14 systems .",
    "section  [ int_ham ] contains a description of the interaction parts of the hamiltonian and the current operators .",
    "the calculated @xmath15 and @xmath16 meson as well as the @xmath17 spectra are described in section  [ sec_spec ] .",
    "section  [ sec_curr ] describes the quark current operators , including the two - quark current that arises along with a linear scalar confining interaction .",

    "the blankenbecler  sugar equation for a @xmath6 system may be expressed as an eigenvalue equation of the form @xmath18    here @xmath19 is the reduced mass of the heavy quark ( @xmath0 ) mass @xmath20 and the light the antiquark ( @xmath21 ) mass @xmath22 : @xmath23 .",

    ".    numerical solution of the wave equation  ( [ wave ] ) yields a value for the eigenvalue @xmath24 .",
    "the energy ( rest mass ) of the @xmath6 meson is then obtained as @xmath35 in the equal mass case @xmath36 this expression reduces to @xmath37 .",
    "the relation between the ( total ) energy @xmath25 of the @xmath6 system and the eigenvalue @xmath24 in the equation ( 1 ) shows that the relativistic treatment of the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian leads to a lowering of the former in comparison to what a nonrelativistic treatment would have implied .",
    "this is a consequence of the effective weakening of the repulsive kinetic energy operator , that results when the quadratic @xmath38 terms are replaced by square roots of @xmath38 . despite the formal similarity between the blankenbecler - sugar equation and the schrdinger equation , the former employs a quadratic mass operator .",
    "the main component of the interaction between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks is the linear confining interaction , which is well defined only in the position space representation , which we shall therefore adhere to .",
    "while the blankenbecler  sugar equation takes full account of the relativistic two - quark kinetic energy operator , the relativistic aspects of the hyperfine interaction operators will be treated perturbatively .",
    "this treatment is more than adequate for the heavy quark , but less so for the light one .",
    "it does , however , allow retention of the conventional operator structure of the interaction operator between the quarks .",
    "the linear confining interaction will here  on the basis of compelling indications  be assumed to be a scalar in the spinor representation @xcite . to second order in the inverse quark masses this interaction , as calculated from the invariant amplitude according to  ( [ qpot ] ) , takes the form @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the string tension parameter , the value of which is @xmath41 1 gev / fm . the mass coefficient @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 the spin  independent term that is proportional to @xmath44 is a consequence of the square root factors in  ( [ qpot ] ) . without those factors the factor 3/2 in the momentum dependent term in the first bracket on the r.h.s , of  ( [ conf ] ) would be 1 .",
    "the terms of second order in the inverse quark masses in  ( [ conf ] ) are implied by scalar coupling for the confining interaction .",
    "as the antisymmetric spin - orbit interaction has no diagonal matrix elements between any of the states in the @xmath45- and @xmath46-shells , and only connects spin singlet and triplet states with @xmath47 it contributes to the energy only at quartic order in the inverse quark masses .",
    "the term of second order in @xmath48 in the spin - independent term in  ( [ conf ] ) is unrealistically large for light quarks , but is substantially moderated by inclusion of the next term in the ( asymptotic ) @xmath49 expansion . similarly the spin - orbit interaction in  ( [ conf ] ) is unrealistically large for light quarks . both of these explicitly",
    "velocity dependent terms are strongly moderated by the higher order terms in the ( asymptotic ) expansion in @xmath50 .",
    "this is seen directly by comparison to the corresponding terms in the the quartic correction term to  ( [ conf ] ) , which takes the form    @xmath51   \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox { } \\left .",

    "thus e.g. in the static limit the spin - orbit component may be calculated from the central component as @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the central confining potential and @xmath58 is the coefficient function for the spin - orbit coupling operator @xmath59 . when the static limit is not invoked , the corresponding relation is more complicated . to a good approximation",
    "it may however be cast in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this relation implies that the static approximation to the spin - orbit interaction in  ( [ conf ] ) represents a considerable overestimate of the net spin - orbit interaction in the case of light constituent quarks .",
    "a similar more accurate representation of the quadratic spin - orbit component of the confining interaction obtains with the replacement @xmath63    the @xmath64 expansion of the interaction is an asymptotic series , which has to be truncated . as in the case of constituent",
    "quarks the successive terms have increasing amplitudes of alternating signs , this series is but a poor representation of the full spinorial structure of the interaction , the velocity dependence of which is well behaved . we shall therefore truncate the interaction to second order and retain only the local spin - orbit and quadratic spin - orbit interaction terms of quartic order .",
    "the latter is numerically insignificant for the low angular momentum states considered here .    to this order the most realistic treatment of the velocity dependent correction @xmath65 to the linear potential @xmath66 in  ( [ conf ] ) would be to take it into account as a mass shift , @xmath67 in the kinetic term in  ( [ conf ] ) .",
    "we shall treat this reduction of the kinetic term phenomenologically by subtraction of a constant ( @xmath68 ) from the kinetic term .",
    "the value of this constant is determined by a fit of the calculated spectra to the experimental one .",
    "without such a constant the kinetic term in the hamiltonian becomes unrealistically large as becomes evident below .",
    "in the case of heavy quarkonia the perturbative gluon exchange interaction forms an important component of the hyperfine interaction between quarks @xcite . to second order in the inverse quark masses ( with exception for the quadratic spin - orbit interaction , which is quartic ) that interaction , after multiplication of the square root factors in  ( [ qpot ] )",

    "this conclusion differs from that in ref.@xcite .",
    "the calculated results are however very sensitive to the parameters in the model , and to the relativistic damping of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "this suggests that that model for the hyperfine interaction ( relativistic gluon exchange ) may not provide a sufficiently complete description of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "it may be conjectured that screening the gluon exchange interaction at shorter distances and compensating with the instanton induced interaction may lead to less parameter sensitive results .",
    "both the blankenbecler - sugar and gross quasipotential reductions of the bethe - salpeter equation lead to two - body exchange current operators , which connect to negative energy intermediate states . if the confining interaction couples as a scalar to the quarks , the accompanying two - quark magnetic moment is a pure spin - flip operator for mesons with equal quark and antiquark masses .",
    "the contribution of this operator is essential for obtaining realistic m1 transition rates for heavy quarkonia @xcite . in the equal mass case",
    "the analog two - quark operator that arises with a vector confining interaction has no spin - flip component @xcite .    for mesons with unequal quark and antiquark masses",
    "the gluon exchange current operator has a spin - flip component .",
    "it therefore also contributes to the m1 decay rates of the heavy - light mesons .",
    "although this contribution is much smaller than that of the confining interaction , it is significant in the case of the m1 transitions between the ground state vector and pseudoscalar heavy - light mesons , because of the partial cancellation between the matrix elements of the single quark current operators and those of the exchange current associated with the confining interaction .",
    "strong conclusions concerning the m1 transition rates here have to await experimental determination of the total width of the heavy - flavor vector mesons .",
    "as the relative branching ratios for m1 decays of these mesons are known , the key missing empirical information is their total widths for strong decay .",

    "<S> the m1 decay widths of charm and bottom mesons and their excited states are sensitive to the relativistic aspect of the quark current operators and obtain a significant contribution from the interaction current that is associated with the scalar confining interaction between heavy quarks ( @xmath0 ) and light antiquarks ( @xmath1 ) . consequently they provide direct evidence on the latter . the spectra and the m1 transition widths of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 mesons and their orbital excitations </S>",
    "<S> are calculated here within the framework of the blankenbecler - sugar equation , which allows a covariant treatment , while retaining a formal similarity to the nonrelativistic approach . the hyperfine interaction in the @xmath6 mesons </S>",
    "<S> is modeled by screened gluon exchange , which shares many features with the instanton induced interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the model is tested by calculation of the spectra and m1 decay widths of charmonium .    </S>",
