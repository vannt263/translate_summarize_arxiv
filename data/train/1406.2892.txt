    "in the brane - world scenario , our universe is depicted as a four - dimensional ( 4d ) sub - manifold ( 3-brane ) embedded in a higher dimensional space - time . within this framework ,",

    "the key feature of this approach is that thick branes are dynamically generated by one or several background scalar fields coupled with gravity .    in the pursuit of a more realistic picture of the brane - world , it is also important to provide a natural localization mechanism of bulk fields on domain walls . as shown in @xcite , the graviton can be successfully localized on a thick brane built with a single background scalar in an asymptotic five - dimensional ( 5d ) ads space - time .",
    "massless scalar fields can also be localized in this minimal setup , but unfortunately vector gauge fields seem to require a richer brane structure .",

    "a significant amount of work has been devoted to the problem of vector gauge field localization in the context of 5d ads space - time , in both singular and thick domain wall branes .",
    "the models available in literature show a wide variety of ideas , which include : mass terms for the vector boson @xcite , coupling between the dilaton and the kinetic term of gauge fields @xcite , insertion of kinetic terms induced by localized fermions @xcite , and a smearing out dielectric function inspired by the friedberg ",

    "the basic setup of the model is a thick brane embedded in an asymptotically 5d ads bulk space - time , described by a single real background scalar field . in this framework ,",

    "we have proposed a new mechanism for abelian gauge field localization on thick branes .",
    "the key feature of the model is the presence of stueckelberg - compensating fields , which allow for the introduction of yukawa - like interactions in a gauge - invariant ( and einstein - covariant ) way .    in the vector case ,",
    "the interaction between the brane and the gauge field is modeled by a function @xmath38 that depends on the classical background responsible for the brane formation . identifying the brane with a domain - wall solution generated by a single real scalar @xmath0 through some super - potential @xmath13 , with asymptotic ads behavior in five dimensions",
    ", we have shown that there is a whole family of functions @xmath184 constructed from @xmath13 and its derivatives which guarantee the existence of a normalizable zero - energy vector ground state in the theory .",
    "we have also studied the scalar sector of the model , concluding that despite being apparently normalizable , the scalar zero mode is not trapped by the brane .",
    "it turns out to be a null state in the effective 4d low - energy theory .",
    "the presence of such a null state might indicate either the presence of a hidden left - over gauge symmetry or the presence of a quantum instability ( a ghost mode ) in the bulk spectrum .",
    "in fact it is interesting to notice how the cosmological setup of  @xcite also displays an instability , of tachyonic type . it would be interesting to investigate further on these aspects .",
    "the same localization mechanism can be straightforwardly applied to the abelian kr field . in this case",
    ", we have also found a one - parameter family of brane  gauge coupling functions @xmath179 compatible with the presence of a normalizable zero mode .",
    "such a straightforward generalization is expected to be kept for a generic antisymmetric form field .",
