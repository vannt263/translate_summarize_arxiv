    "while the physics of correlated electron systems is an interesting and formidable problem in its own right , several classes of interesting materials exhibit an interplay of strong electron - electron coulomb repulsion and strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "for example , the electron - phonon coupling in high-@xmath1 cuprates is strong , as evidenced by the kinks observed in the angle - resolved photoemission spectrum.@xcite in alkali - doped fullerides an @xmath5-wave superconducting phase borders an antiferromagnetic phase in the temperature - pressure phase diagram@xcite and the transition temperature of the superconducting state has recently been found to be dome - shaped .",
    "these features indicate that in these classes of materials , both the electron - electron coulomb repulsion and the electron - phonon interaction are strong .",
    "likewise , in aromatic superconductors such as picene ( a recent addition to carbon - based materials ) , the electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions are reported to be strong,@xcite although the mechanism of superconductivity in the aromatic compounds is still totally unclear .",
    "correlated electron systems often provide an interesting arena in which various phases compete with each other . in the presence of strong electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions ,",
    "the problem should become even richer .",
    "the holstein - hubbard ( hh ) model is a simple model which allows to describe and explore the interplay of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the model incorporates a coupling between electrons and dispersionless ( i.e. , einstein ) phonons with energy @xmath6 , in addition to the on - site hubbard interaction @xmath3 .",
    "there is a body of works which investigates the competition between the two interactions in this model .",
    "the study of the one - dimensional case based on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique or quantum monte carlo analysis has revealed some general features.@xcite however , since ordered phases with continuous symmetry breaking do not occur in @xmath7 , it is difficult to elucidate the generic behavior of ordered states from these calculations , although we can indeed discuss quasi - ordered states in terms of the tomonaga - luttinger picture . in the opposite limit of infinite spatial dimensions , @xmath8 , where the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) becomes exact,@xcite ordered states with full symmetry breaking exist even at nonzero temperature .",
    "the effect of the competition between the two kinds of interactions on symmetric phases have been studied in refs .  , and the corresponding phase diagram has been determined .    as for the ordered states , their properties",
    "have been investigated in several works,@xcite but many issues remain unresolved .",
    "the ground state phase diagram around @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the static effective electron - electron interaction mediated by the phonons , has been determined in refs .  , and",
    "deviations from the conventional theory of superconductivity have been discussed.@xcite an important issue is the following : the electron - phonon coupled system is often regarded as having an effective interaction @xmath11 , but this is only strictly valid in the antiadiabatic limit for the phonon energy , @xmath12 , where the interaction in the hh model becomes non - retarded , and the real question is to what extent this approximation remains valid when we vary @xmath3 and/or @xmath6 . in other words , for a finite @xmath6 the phonon - mediated interaction is certainly retarded , and for small enough phonon frequency , the static model with @xmath2 can be expected to fail .",
    "thus the nature of the superconducting state in the regime where @xmath3 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 are all comparable to the bandwidth @xmath13 poses an challenging problem , which is not only conceptually interesting , but may have relevance to real materials with strong electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the problem , however , has not been properly understood , since superconducting states in such a regime can not be treated within conventional theories such as the migdal theorem@xcite or the macmillan equation.@xcite another open issue is the finite - temperature phase diagram for ordered phases in the vicinity of @xmath9 .    with these questions in mind , we study in this paper ordered states in the half - filled holstein - hubbard model to clarify the effect of the coexistence of electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions on the @xmath5-wave superconducting state ( sc ) , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) state and the charge ordered state ( co ) . in our study",
    "we employ dmft , with a continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) impurity solver , which is exact up to statistical errors , and can in principle access any parameter regime down to temperatures of about one percent of the electronic bandwidth .",
    "furthermore , dmft + ct - qmc can treat these three ordered states without bias , which enables us to systematically investigate their competition in the regime where @xmath3 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 are comparable to the bandwidth . note that even though there have been several works discussing ordered states in hh model , @xcite the present work is , to the best of our knowledge , the first attempt to directly treat these ordered phases at non - zero temperatures with dmft+ct - qmc . for sc ,",
    "we focus on the transition temperature and the superconducting order parameter .",
    "we show that the phonon - induced retardation ( when the phonon energy is well below the antiadiabatic limit ) or the coulomb repulsion have the effect of significantly decreasing and shifting the @xmath1 dome against @xmath2 , and a similar shift occurs for the superconducting order parameter as well . in order to understand and interpret the observed behavior we use an effective static model in a polaron representation with reduced bandwidth derived from a lang - firsov transformation , which has been introduced to investigate",
    "electron - phonon coupled systems in the strong - coupling or antiadiabatic regime.@xcite we test the quantitative and qualitative reliability of the effective model by examining to what extent the model reproduces the transition temperature , superconducting order parameter and green s function . as for af and co phases ,",
    "we determine the phase diagram at nonzero temperature , and show how these phases compete with each other at moderate to strong couplings .",
