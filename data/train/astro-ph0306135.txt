    "blazars [ optically violently variable ( ovv ) quasars and bl lac objects ] are probably `` normal '' active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with relativistic jets pointed somewhat in the direction of the observer , in which doppler - boosted radiation plays a large part in their observed spectra .",
    "many of the popular models of blazars involve relativistic beaming ( blandford , mckee , & rees 1977 ; cohen et  al . 1977 ; bassani & dean 1981 ; unwin et  al .",
    "1989 ; dermer , schlickeiser , & mastichiadis 1992 ; maraschi , ghisellini , & celotti 1992 ; dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; zdziarski & krolik 1993 ; sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ) .",
    "these models can explain ( 1 ) how the relativistic expansion of the jets avoids electron - positron ( @xmath6 ) pair production that attenuates @xmath2-rays in compact sources ( bassani & dean 1981 ; dermer et  al .",
    "1992 ) and ( 2 ) how the expansion avoids the so - called compton catastrophe that raises radio photons to x - ray photons by self - compton scattering ( i.e. , the expansion provides the conditions for us to observe large fluxes of @xmath2-rays and radio photons ) .",
    "in addition , these models appear to give an explanation for the observed one - sided jets , while also explaining why matter appears to be ejected with speeds greater than the speed of light ( superluminal motion ) .",
    "such models are no doubt important",
    ". however , these models are less successful in explaining the origin of the ultrarelativistic electrons emerging from the nucleus with lorentz factors up to @xmath7 .",
    "such high energy particles it appears are needed in relativistic beaming models to initiate the expansion .",
    "that is , one must first find a mechanism to create copious ultrarelativistic electrons with maximum lorentz factors @xmath8 ( sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ) in order to make these superluminal expansion models operate efficiently to reproduce the observed spectra . here in this paper ,",
    "i present such a mechanism .",
    "in this paper , i present a 4-dimensional , fully relativistic , theoretical and numerical ( monte carlo ) model calculation of penrose ( 1969 ) scattering processes in the ergosphere of a supermassive rotating black hole , which allows the extraction of orbital energy and momentum from particles in bound trapped orbits near the event horizon .",
    "this energy and momentum escape from the black hole to large distances in the form of x - rays , @xmath2-rays , and @xmath6 pairs .",
    "this black hole model for the energy source of agns ( 1 ) naturally produces one - sided jets  a purely relativistic effect related to the extreme inertial frame dragging in the ergosphere ( williams 2002a , 2002b , 2001 ) ; ( 2 ) shows that agns may or may not be strong @xmath2-ray emitters , depending on the form of the accretion disk and the jet axis orientation relative to the observers line of sight ; ( 3 ) @xmath6 pairs emerge from the nucleus with lorentz factors up to @xmath9 , enabling relativistic beaming models to yield apparent energies in the tev range ; and ( 4 ) produces jets of escaping energetic vortical orbiting particles collimated about the rotation axis of the black hole ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ; williams 2002b , 2001)this also is a purely relativistic effect caused by the frame dragging .",
    "this frame dragging ( sometimes referred to as the lense - thirring effect ) is due to the gravitational force associated with a rotating mass ( thirring & lense 1918 ) .    in general ,",
    "past models have attempted to explain both items ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above solely by relativistic beaming ; and because of this , inconsistencies have arisen : observations seem to suggest that these features ( the one - sided jets and the sometimes strong @xmath2-ray emission ) may not just be optical illusions , as in the case of relativistic beaming models , but instead may also be intrinsic to the source ( barthel 1987 ) .",
    "i have found this to be true in the theoretical and numerical analysis of the penrose mechanism presented in this paper .",
    "in addition , relativistic beaming models can not explain one - sided jets when the observed radiation from the jet does not appear to be near the observer s line of sight , i.e. , when the source exhibits little superluminal expansion ( jones 1987 ) .",
    "moreover , findings by dennett - thorpe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , after studying the asymmetry of jets , lobe length , and spectral index in a sample of quasars , with well defined jets , led them to conclude that the simplest models of relativistic beaming fail to explain the `` present observations '' ; and that only if the intrinsic spectrum is curved ( i.e. , with the spectral index increasing with frequency ) , such that the approaching lobe is seen at a significant lower frequency , will asymmetry of the right sense be produced .",
    "this supports my findings that some asymmetry in the jet / counter jet may be intrinsic to the energy source , and that , relativistic beaming may just serve as an important enhancement mechanism ( williams 2002a , 2002b ) .",
    "further , observations of so - called microquasars in our galaxy show some asymmetry in the jet and counter jet distributions ( mirabel & rodriguez 1998 ) ; and not all of the observed asymmetry can be explained by relativistic beaming , suggesting that some asymmetry is intrinsic ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ; mirabel & rodiguez 1996 ) .    as related to item (",
    "3 ) above , some attempts have been made to generate the ultrarelativistic particles in standard accretion disk models using electrodynamics ( blandford 1976 , blandford & znajek 1977 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ; phinney 1982 ; blandford & payne 1982 ; lovelace 1976 , lovelace & scott 1982 ; lovelace & burns 1982 ; punsly & coroniti 1989 , 1990a , 1990b ; punsly 1991 ) .",
    "in such models , it is proposed that , the dipolar - like magnetic field lines  due to the accretion disk  thread through the highly conductive disk plasma , inducing an electric field while torquing the rotating black hole or the accretion disk , creating an electromagnetic field which acts like a dynamo , resulting in the generation of two oppositely - directed jets of poynting fluxes [ @xmath10 of electromagnetic energy .",
    "these past models are complex and have problems as pointed out by punsly and coroniti ( 1989 , 1990a , 1990b ) . the model ( punsly 1991 ) in which the disk magnetic field lines thread the ergospheric disk , extracting rotational energy by means of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , although complex , appears to be potentially powerful ; however , it in itself , does not appear to produce the large lorentz factors and luminosities needed to universally explain observations",
    ". moreover , such models , as of yet , are not easy to qualify ( eilek 1980 , 1991 ) , even until today .",
    "the electrodynamics of these models probably best describe collimation and acceleration of relativistic particles that emerge from the nucleus by some other process , such as the penrose process described here ; and thus , the electrodynamics could possibly sustain the jets of relativistic particles out to their observed distances , while producing the beaming effect .",
    "now , it has been generally believed in the past that inflow from the accretion disk into the black hole is a mhd ( or hydrodynamic ) process ; and one would think that postulating particles in geodesic orbits is inconsistent with participating in the inflow .",
    "however , these present model calculations are not saying that the penrose scattering particles do not participate in the inflow  yielding inconsistency ; what they are saying is that the geodesic characteristics of the particles appear to be the best way to define the inflow and outflow of plasma close to the event horizon .",
    "this flow , of course , can no doubt be treated as a fluid : whose velocity pattern is controlled by the density , pressure , temperature , magnetic field , and gravitational field  however , mhd may not be the best treatment for this already extremely complex problem , i.e. , where gravity is dominant .",
    "moreover , based on the consistency of the energy - momentum four - vectors ( or four - momenta ) of the scattered penrose particles with the observations of quasars and other objects we observe to be powered by black holes ( i.e. , high energies and luminosities , asymmetrical and collimated jets ) , it appears that the geodesic treatment of many individual particles is sufficient to describe the flow , at least very close to the event horizon . at most , mhd models ( whenever the major problems associated with them are worked out , such as , how to convert from electromagnetic energy to particle energy , i.e. , from a poynting flux to a relativistic particle flux )",
    "will duplicate what i have already found from these penrose processes ( see for example the discussing in appendix a ) , and will in no doubt describe the flow of the jets away from the black hole , at a distance where electromagnetic collimation due to accretion disk properties may become important .",
    "however , the single - particle approach is essential close to the black hole even in a more realistic mhd treatment , especially when the fluid is in a supersonic regime ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ) .",
    "gravity apparently causes the bulk of fluid elements to behave like the bulk motion of individual particles moving along geodesics .",
    "further , considering the blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) model referenced above , although recently , once again , has risen in popularity , this model which attempts to extract rotational energy from a rotating black hole , as related to the penrose mechanism , is not tenable , as pointed out by punsly and coroniti ( 1989 , 1990a , 1990b ) , according to the `` no - hair '' theorem ( carter 1973 ; misner , thorne , & wheeler 1973 ) and the `` vacuum infinity '' horizon ( regge & wheeler 1957 ; punsly 1989 ) .",
    "specifically , the blandford - znajek model appears to be untenable for at least two reasons : ( 1 ) it relies on energy and angular momentum being transported out of the event horizon by an electric current ; however , the assumption that the electric current can freely flow into and out of the horizon is not valid ; ( 2 ) the horizon is causally decoupled from the accretion disk plasma , including its magnetic field , thus making this model an ineffective way of extracting rotational energy ( punsly 1991 , 1996 ) . in other words ,",
    "the magnetic field lines of the surrounding accretion disk can not anchor to the `` vacuum infinity , '' and in general , charge neutral horizon , before being expelled or redshifted away ( bik 2000 ; bik & ledvinka 2000 ) , thereby being unable to torque the black hole , generating an electric field , leading to a poynting flux .",
    "that is , just as the kerr metric (   2 ) asymptotically goes to a minkowski ( flat spacetime ) metric at infinity , such that an observer at infinity is not affected by the black hole , so is the vacuum infinity horizon to the magnetic field and neutral plasma of the accretion disk , suggesting that blandford - znajek type models may be important at an `` effective '' faraway distance from the event horizon .",
    "this presents a problem for mhd models of agns that rely on the blandford - znajek process to extract electromagnetic energy from the rotating black hole ( e.g. , blandford & levinson 1994 ; hirotani & okamoto 1998 ; li 2002 ) .    still other attempts have been made to create the ultrarelativistic electrons by shocks in the jets themselves , associated with either dense clouds accelerated by the flow or with an unsteady velocity field in the jet ( blandford & mckee 1977 ; jones & tobin 1977 ; marscher 1978 ) .",
    "such shocks could possibly explain the local acceleration along the jet at a distance from the nucleus , perhaps even out to the lobes .",
    "however , these models are not self - contained ; they must assume that the initial blast , which initiates the shocks , originated within the nucleus of the compact source as a result of an explosion or instability .",
    "in this paper , i present an analysis of the penrose mechanism by which the central black hole source can eject a `` blast '' of ultrarelativistic particles , escaping into the polar regions , mainly @xmath6 pairs and some lower energy hard x - ray and @xmath2-ray photons .",
    "subsequently , the penrose produced pairs can possibly interact with a surrounding electromagnetic field , through synchrotron and curvature radiation processes , while undergoing comptonization , thereby , adding to the initial penrose relativistic expansion , and thus , giving rise to shock waves and beaming effects .",
    "the penrose mechanism , or black hole model for agns , presented here , invokes the ultrarelativistic @xmath6 pair production as a direct result of the high temperatures in the accretion disk .",
    "shapiro , lightman , and eardley ( 1976 ) and other authors ( eilek 1980 ; eilek and kafatos 1983 ) calculate a model for a two - temperature disk in which the protons in the inner region of the disk attain a temperature of @xmath11  k due to the absence of any efficient cooling mechanism ( see   4.1 for details )",
    ". such high temperatures ( @xmath12  mev ) can result in copious pion production ( eilek 1980 ; mahadevan , narayan , & krolik 1997 ) , in which neutral pion ( @xmath13 ) decays , produce abundant @xmath2-rays with energies up to @xmath14  mev , narrowly peaked around @xmath15  mev , assuming that the initial protons have a thermal distribution .",
    "such decay products are candidates for the penrose mechanism . williams ( 1995 , hereafter paper  1 )",
    "has shown that penrose pair production ( ppp ) , in the ergosphere of a supermassive ( @xmath16 ) rotating kerr black hole ( kbh ) , at the photon orbit , can be significant , wherein , the @xmath2-rays , resulting from @xmath13 decays , are used as seed photons to populate the photon orbit . moreover ,",
    "such accretion disks with thermally unstable inner regions ( piran 1978 ) , which could vary between unstable configurations ( narayan 1997 ) , would be conducive to a blast of ultrarelativistic particles .",
    "eilek and kafatos ( 1983 ) used the structure of the two - temperature disk in a canonical kerr metric ( thorne 1974 ) to calculate the high - energy spectrum of such disks .",
    "they predict @xmath2-ray luminosity , due to the @xmath13 decays , as high as 10% of the bolometric luminosity in sub - eddington models . in these present calculations ,",
    "i assume such @xmath2-ray luminosity [ calculated to be @xmath17 at @xmath18  mev , yielding a @xmath2-ray rate of @xmath19 ( eilek & kafatos 1983 ) ] to populated the photon orbit in the highest energy ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes .",
    "these infalling @xmath2-rays are assumed to populate the photon orbit by a method similar to that assumed by eilek and kafatos ( 1983 ) , and earlier by leiter and kafatos ( 1978 ) , to supply the seed photons for ppp ( @xmath20 ) in the coulomb field of orbiting protons near the event horizon , specifically between the radii of marginally bound @xmath21 and marginally stable @xmath22 orbits .",
    "such seed photons , proposed by these authors , after being blueshifted in energy by a factor of @xmath23 ( see below ) , due to rotation of the kbh and the curvature of spacetime , will achieve energies as high as @xmath1  gev .",
    "however , it is shown in paper  1 that the ppp ( @xmath20 ) in the coulomb field of a proton as initially proposed by leiter and kafatos ( 1978 ) , proved to be unfruitful ( see discussion in   2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is also shown in paper  1 , that , when these @xmath2-rays ( produced by the @xmath13 decays ) are assumed to populate the photon orbit , upon being blueshifted in energy by a factor of @xmath24 ( see below ) , the ppp ( @xmath3 ) can occur in which large fluxes of ultrarelativistic @xmath4 pairs of energy @xmath1  gev are allowed to escape from the nucleus into the polar regions .",
    "an aim of this paper is to show that such ultrarelativistic ppp electrons ( with @xmath7 ) can undergo inverse comptonization with surrounding lower energy photons , say from the accretion disk , boosting the energy of these photons up to @xmath1  gev , or apparently higher due to beaming effects , and the resulting @xmath2-ray luminosities are consistent with the observed spectra of quasars 3c 279 and 3c 273 .",
    "note , the blueshift factor @xmath25 , mentioned above , can be found in the transformation eq .",
    "( 2.8d ) of paper  1 , and is given by the kerr metric coefficient eq .",
    "( 2.10a ) , also of paper  1 .",
    "it is a well known parameter in the theory of kerr metric black holes .",
    "its inverse is sometimes referred to as the  redshift factor ",
    "( thorne et al . 1986 ; see also eq . ( 2.7d ) of paper  1 ) .",
    "this blueshift factor gives the blueshift in the energy of a particle , at a specific radius , as measured by a local frame observer .",
    "such blueshifted energies of the particles ( due to the fact that any particle falling into the ergosphere must rotate in the direction of the kbh ) can be extracted by these penrose scattering processes ( as will be described in this paper ) .",
    "the calculated values of the blueshift factors at the radii @xmath22 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 , the photon orbit , are approximately 10.7 , 32 , and 52 , respectively , for @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the angular momentum per unit mass parameter of the kbh , with @xmath29 ) ,    in general , the observed spectra of quasars show intense nonthermal continuum radiation with highly excited emission lines .",
    "the broad - band photon spectrum shows a characteristic mixture of thermal and nonthermal emission , from radio to @xmath2-ray frequencies .",
    "the nonthermal continuum spectrum appears to be associated with the nucleus and the astrophysical jets , and the thermal emission appears to be associated with the accretion disk .",
    "features in the radio , x - ray , and @xmath2-ray spectra , and the astrophysical jets associated with radio loud quasars seem to distinguish two populations : radio loud and radio quiet quasars .",
    "for example , in radio loud quasars , the infrared baseline power law that always drops in the millimeter band ( the mm - break ) drops only @xmath30 2 decades .",
    "the great majority of quasars , i.e. , the radio quiet quasars , have a much stronger mm - break @xmath31 to 6 decades ( elvis 1988 ) . the size of the mm - break does not seem to affect the infrared ( ir ) to uv continuum shapes .",
    "however , there is clearly a correlation between radio loudness and the x - ray emission slope : a weak mm - break implies a strong x - ray turn up .",
    "moreover , observations ( fichtel 1992 , 1993 ) suggest that the high energy @xmath2-ray spectra ( @xmath32  mev ) detected in radio loud quasars further distinguish the two populations , since only radio loud quasars were detected in this energy range . in this paper ,",
    "i show that the density and thermal instabilities occurring in the inner region of the accretion disk [ which increase the temperature , giving rise to the so - called two - temperature , bistable disk model , in which the disk can in principle exist in two phases : a thin disk and ion torus ( lightman & eardley 1974 ; shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ) ] could be closely related to there being radio loud and radio quiet quasars .",
    "disk models of this sort are also referred to as thin disk / ion corona models , or more recently , the `` hot '' phase of these type of disks have been called advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) : further details are given in ",
    "4 . in adafs",
    ", the energy released by viscous dissipation is stored in the gas as entropy and advected into the black hole with a small fraction being radiated away ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ; narayan , kato , honma 1997 ; narayan et al .",
    "note that , i will sometimes interchangeably refer to the ion corona as the ion torus or adaf .",
    "energies as high as @xmath33  gev have been observed in the spectral observations of quasars 3c 279 , 3c 273 , pks 0208@xmath34512 , and pks 0528@xmath35134 ( hartman et  al .",
    "1992 ; von montigny et  al .",
    "1993 ; hermsen et  al .",
    "1993 ; hunter et  al .",
    "even higher energies @xmath30  tev have been observed in the bl lac @xmath2-ray source markarian 421 ( punch et  al .",

    "figure 1 shows schematic energy spectra of 3c 279 and 3c 273 , based on a number of observations .",
    "details of figure 1 will be discussed in later sections of this paper .",
    "overall , in this paper , i present results of theoretical model calculations using the monte carlo numerical method to treat penrose scattering processes in the ergosphere of a kbh : the cases considered here are inverse compton scattering and @xmath2-ray@xmath2-ray pair production ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these processes are assumed to occur in material falling into the ergospheric region of a rotating black hole from a surrounding accretion disk that extends inside the ergosphere to approximately the marginally stable radius ( eilek 1980 ) .",
    "resulting from these scattering processes , high energy particles are emitted with calculated luminosities that are in agreement with the general observed spectra of agns ; and in this model , relativistic beaming can be used as an enhancement mechanism , giving rise to the objects we call blazars . the theoretical background for these computations",
    "are presented in paper  1 (",
    "i refer the reader to paper  1 for a thorough description of the model ) . here , i concentrate on the astrophysical results , using these penrose processes to explain the observed energy spectra of 3c 279 and 3c 273 : these quasars were chosen because of the availability of the data on them , while assuming that they can serve to represent in general all agns . in   2 ,",
    "a summary is given of the general formalism of the penrose mechanism considered in paper  1 .",
    "in   3 , relevant observations of 3c  279 , 3c  273 , and other agns are presented . in   4 ,",
    "i summarize the overall results of the penrose compton scattering ( pcs ) and ppp processes considered in paper  1 .",
    "this summary includes an astrophysical discussion of the pcs and ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes , as correlated with popular theoretical accretion disk models for agns , in particular the classical thin disk and the thin disk / ion corona . in   5 ,",
    "i compare the model results with observations of 3c 279 and 3c 273 .",
    "specifically , i compare the observed luminosity spectra with the calculated luminosity spectra due to the penrose processes . finally , in   6 , i present conclusions and future investigations .",
    "a mechanism suggested by roger penrose ( 1969 ) permits rotational energy to be extracted from a kbh .",
    "the @xmath36 penrose process utilizes the existence of retrograde particle orbits ( with respect to the rotation of the kbh ) in the ergosphere . in general , it is possible for a particle , say @xmath37 , that has fallen inwardly from infinity into the ergosphere to scatter off another particle , say @xmath38 , initially in a bound direct orbit .",
    "if the orbit of the scattering particle @xmath38 changes into a retrograde orbit ( of negative energy ) , then the scattered particle @xmath37 can escape to infinity with more mass - energy than the sum of the initial energies of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "since the orbit of the initially bound particle @xmath38 is dependent on the angular momentum of the kbh and the curvature of spacetime defined by the mass @xmath39 of the black hole , then , consequently , when @xmath38 gives up energy to the escaping particle @xmath37 and falls through the event horizon , the kbh loses energy in the form of rotational energy .",
    "a possible class of penrose processes occur when particles already inside the ergosphere ( say particles from an accretion disk ) undergo local relativistic scatterings ( piran , shaham , & katz 1975 ; paper  1 ) . if one of the scattering particles is initially in a bound orbit , as in the general description above , then it is possible for the other initially unbound scattered particle to escape to infinity with rotational energy from the kbh .",
    "this process allows scattered ergospheric particles to ( 1 ) escape to infinity with more mass - energy than they would have had if the scattering occurred outside the ergosphere ; and ( 2 ) escape to infinity with mass - energy initially trapped by the kbh , mass - energy that more than likely had no other way of escaping , save these penrose processes .",
    "this is because for a particle initially trapped by the kbh , an escaping orbit is said to occur only when some physical process near the hole injects the particle into such an orbit ( bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ) .",
    "since the inner edge of an accretion disk around a kbh with @xmath40 can extend inward to the radius of marginal stable orbits , @xmath41 , which is inside the ergosphere , then a large enough fraction of the disk luminosity can possibly reach the radii of importance for the occurrences of penrose scattering processes .",
    "that is , the fraction of the disk luminosity intersecting at the the scattering radii will be larger than for the case in which the accretion disk does not extend inside the ergosphere , such as in the cases of nonrotating ( @xmath28=0 ) and slow rotating black holes .",
    "an expression for the fraction of the disk luminosity that falls onto the scattering radii of the black hole can be found .",
    "we assume that the disk can be represented by cylindrical surfaces of various radii @xmath42 , concentric about a spherical shaped region representing near the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "an element of area representing the disk at a given radius @xmath43 , centered on the black hole , as measured by an observer at infinity , can be expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the inner radius of the disk .",
    "similarly , an element of area at the scattering radius @xmath46 on the surface of the sphere representing the region near the black hole is given by @xmath47 we assume also that the disk , which extends inside the ergosphere , radiates into the volume element of space @xmath48 , for sufficiently small @xmath49 and @xmath50 , such that the flux of the radiation from the disk remains nearly constant inward to the scattering radii .",
    "the above assumptions allow an expression for the photon luminosity intersecting the scattering radii : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the disk photon luminosity at the cylindric surface of radius @xmath45 and height @xmath53 above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "equation  ( 3 ) gives the fraction of the disk luminosity impinging on a solid angle with polar bandwidth @xmath54 subtended the black hole at the scattering radius @xmath46 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are polar angles above and below the equatorial plane . from equation",
    "( 3 ) , we see that @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be used as free parameters in these model calculations , however , within limits , as explained below .",
    "note , equation  ( 3 ) , only gives a fraction ( or probability ) , and , therefore , the `` strong bending '' of photon trajectories need not be considered here , since this fraction is only used to show what is needed to fit the model calculated luminosity , due to the penrose mechanism , with observations ( see   5 ) .",
    "that is , the calculated penrose luminosity assumes that every particle in @xmath52 scatters ; the fraction given by equation  ( 3 ) in part accounts for this unrealistic assumption , since in a realistic situation we know that only a fraction of the particles will scatter .",
    "now , the luminosity of photons from the disk used to participate in the penrose scattering processes , defined by @xmath52 in equation  ( 3 ) , is assumed to be a power law distribution based on spectra observations of 3c 279 and 3c 273 ( as described in   5.1 ) . in the trajectories of the infalling photons ,",
    "that actually participate in the individual scattering events , the so - called bending of the light or the warping of spacetime by the rotating black hole has been taken into account , since they are assumed to fall radially along null geodesics in the kerr metric , with the conserved azimuthal angular momentum as measure by an observer at infinity @xmath57 set equal to zero .",
    "this assumption has also been used by other authors ( piran & shaham 1977a ; leiter & kafatos 1978 ; kafatos & leiter 1979 ) for maximum energy gain in a penrose scattering process . in a more realistic situation , @xmath58 will not just be zero , i.e. , the incident angle of the photon relative to the motion of the target particle will generally be anywhere from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "( note , l=0 means that the incident angle is @xmath60 . )",
    "if we normalize equation  ( 3 ) to unity at the inner radius of the accretion disk , by setting @xmath61 and the luminosity @xmath62 , we get the condition that @xmath63 .",
    "this puts a constraint on the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "for example , for the two - temperature accretion disk used in these calculations , of say height @xmath64 , normalized to unity at @xmath65 ( see   4.1 ) , it is required that @xmath66 , @xmath67 , implying that @xmath68 must always be @xmath69 .",
    "if these requirements are satisfied , then equation  ( 3 ) gives that , from @xmath70% at @xmath71 to @xmath72% at @xmath73 of the photons generated in the accretion disk at @xmath74 can fall onto the black hole at these scattering radii ( @xmath46 ) , between @xmath75 .",
    "these radii are where the pcs and the ppp ( @xmath3 ) take place .",
    "so , we see that , if the accretion disk extends inside the ergosphere ( @xmath76 for @xmath77 ) , a large enough fraction of the disk luminosity reaches the scattering radii to make the penrose mechanism a feasible process in the contribution to the observed spectra of agns , contrary to what is estimated to occur in reference to the accretion disk being far away from the ergospheric region , where , in this case , only @xmath78% ( for @xmath79 ) of the disk luminosity would reach the scattering radii ( eilek & kafatos 1983 ) .",
    "however , as we shall see in this investigation , the ratio found in equation  ( 3 ) need not be larger that @xmath80% in order for the penrose mechanism described here to be an effective energy source for agns .",
    "overall , this penrose mechanism could very well be the important source of the relativistic particles emerging from the nucleus of quasars and other agns .",

    "the kerr metric ( kerr 1963 ) , a stationary , axially symmetric , asymptotically flat spacetime solution to the vacuum einstein field equations , describes the geometry outside of a rotating massive body .",
    "this metric , conveniently written in the boyer - lindquist coordinates ( boyer & lindquist 1967 ) , defines the spacetime separation between events near a rotating black hole as measured by an observer at infinity  referred to as the boyer - lindquist coordinate frame ( blf ) .",

    "it is found that , if @xmath89 is initially very close to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , a small amount of accretion ( @xmath92 ) through a disk quickly spins the hole down to a limiting state @xmath93 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath89 is initially below this limiting value , accretion spins the hole up toward it .    upon approaching a kbh from infinity , a limit or a region",
    "is reached where the angular momentum of the kbh causes inertial frames to be dragged around in the direction that the black hole rotates .",
    "this means that , it is impossible for an observer inside this so - called stationary limit to remain at rest relative to distant observers .",
    "this limit is given analytically by @xmath94 the region between this stationary limit and the event horizon [ located at @xmath95 is called the ergosphere .",
    "this means that , inside the ergosphere , the kerr metric in the blf does not allow an observer to be stationary ( in the sense of the observer being at rest with @xmath96 ) because of the dragging of inertial frames ; this makes physical processes difficult to describe in the blf . in order to examine physical processes inside the ergosphere , bardeen , press , & teukolsky ( 1972 )",
    "devised a frame of reference called the local nonrotating frame ( lnrf ) .",
    "observers in this frame rotate with the kbh in such away that the frame dragging effect of the rotating black hole is canceled as much as possible . in the lnrf ,",
    "special relativity applies since locally spacetime has lorentz or flat spacetime geometry .",
    "that is , the lnrf is used as a convenient inertial frame to describe physical processes inside the ergosphere  then one must transform back to the blf to find out what is measured by an observer at infinity ( see paper  1 for details ) .    now , of the three penrose scattering processes presented in paper  1 : pcs , ppp ( @xmath3 ) , and ppp ( @xmath20 ) , the most rewarding ones were the pcs and the ppp ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "since the discovery of quasars in 1963 , numerous observations have been made of them and other agns . below",
    "i present some of the general observed features that are relevant to the present model calculations .",
    "quasars are observed to be the most distant objects , with redshifts up to @xmath98 ( schmidth 1992 ; stern et al .",
    "it is generally accepted by the astrophysical community that these objects and other agns are powered by massive black holes at their cores . even before 1994 , the year in which nasa s hubble space telescope began confirming the existence of black holes in the center of numerous galaxies , a large amount of circumstantial evidence for the presence of massive black holes ( @xmath99 ) in the nuclei of bright nearby galaxies ( @xmath100 mpc ) had accumulated ( filippenko 1988 ) .",
    "further , the overall nuclear activities in galaxies seem to decrease as observational distances approach nearby galaxies .",
    "this should be of no surprise if one believes that many nearby galaxies are evolved quasars that have outlived their quasar phases ; i.e. , their nuclear activities have decreased as the available matter they `` feed '' off has depleted .",
    "some observed spectral properties of agns are the following : at energies greater than @xmath101 kev , the x - ray spectra of agns show a remarkable uniformity with almost all objects , well fixed by simple power laws in the @xmath102 kev band with narrow dispersion in spectral index @xmath103 , as related to the flux density @xmath104 of the photons having a power law @xmath105 distribution .",
    "this universal x - ray power law also exists in lower mass galactic black hole candidates , which suggests that this feature may be due to processes inherent to the central power source .",
    "moreover , it is generally believed that x - ray emission in radio selected qsos ( quasi - stellar objects ) is likely to have two components : one thermal related to the optical luminosity ( @xmath106 ) , and one nonthermal related to the radio luminosity ( @xmath107 ; isobe et  al .",
    "the thermal component could very well be related to the inner region of the accretion disk , and the nonthermal to penrose processes , as described in   5.2 of this paper .",
    "agns emit the major fraction of their power in the @xmath2-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum ( bassani et  al .",
    ". in this region , the observed spectral slopes of quasars range from @xmath108 ( hartman et  al .",
    "1992 ; hunter et  al . 1993 ; bertsch et  al . 1993 ; von montigny et  al . 1993 ; hermsen et  al .",
    "1993 ) , as in the photon emission power law @xmath109 .",
    "the steep spectra up to @xmath110 may be an indication either that photons with a broad range of spectral index are emitted from quasars or that the photon spectrum is a function of the angle from the jet axis ( hunter et  al .",
    "1993 ) , or perhaps a combination of both .",
    "since a large fraction of emitted power is contained at @xmath2-ray energies above @xmath111  mev , this suggests that the production of the @xmath2-ray photons is intimately related to the central power source . also , recall that , energies as high as @xmath30 tev have been observed ( punch et  al .",
    "1992 ; zdziarski & krolik 1993 ) .",
    "observations show agns to be variable on time scales ranging from less than an hour ( hartman et  al .",
    "1992 ) up to years . in general",
    ", this variability appears to be related to accretion disk instabilities .",
    "blazars are the most variable agns ; and they are among the most luminous known objects . from variability studies we know that much of their luminosity is generated inside volumes at most @xmath112  pc across ( jones 1988 ) . because they are linear polarized at several percent , the prevailing view is that the emission is synchrotron .",
    "these objects make up only @xmath113 of all known agns .",
    "as mentioned earlier , relativistic beaming is believed to be important in these object , wherein we observe an apparent increase in source luminosity and energy , and an apparent decrease in size .    when comparing a number of different agns observations ( hermsen et  al .",
    "1992 ; fichtel 1992 ; hunter et  al . 1993 ) , there appears to be five universal regions in the luminosity spectrum where energy is definitely emitted : at @xmath114  hz ( radio / mm ) , @xmath115  hz ( infrared / optical / uv ) , @xmath116  hz ( x - ray ) , @xmath117  hz ( soft @xmath2-ray ) , and @xmath118 ( @xmath2-ray ) ; compare figure  1 .",
    "the exact location of emission , in these regions on the observed luminosity spectrum , probably depends on the characteristics of the accretion disk and to what extent the source is superluminous .",
    "the observed @xmath1  tev emission in mrk 412 and a few other blazars ( stecker , de jager , & salamon 1996 ) appear , from these present model calculations , to be extreme cases of conditions that can occur to effect the observed spectrum ( namely , penrose processes , relativistic beaming , and an adaf)as will be discussed in   6 .",
    "quasar 3c 279 ( fig .",
    "1@xmath28 ) is an ovv quasar , which means , in general , that observations show intense optical variability , and a highly polarized optical continuum ; 3c 279 is also radio loud .",
    "it has a redshift @xmath119 , implying a distance @xmath120  mpc ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "this quasar was the first object in which superluminal motion was detected ( whitney et  al .",
    "1971 ) . a change of @xmath122 in x - ray intensity ( @xmath123  kev ) on a time scale of less than an hour has been observed . in general , the x - ray luminosity is observed to vary around @xmath124 , with flux @xmath104 spectral index @xmath106 ( i.e. , photon @xmath125 or @xmath126 spectral index @xmath127 ) . in @xmath2-ray intensity ( @xmath128  mev ) , 3c  279 has been observed to be time variable on the order of a day ( fichtel 1993 ) .",
    "the energy output per logarithmic energy interval observed by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard the compton gamma ray observatory ( gro ) in the high - energy @xmath2-ray band above @xmath129  mev is larger than in any other frequency band ( hartman et  al .",
    "the spectrum of the detected emission is well represented by a power law ( @xmath130 ) of photon spectral index @xmath131 .",
    "if the emission from 3c  279 is isotropic , its @xmath2-ray luminosity between @xmath129  mev and @xmath132  gev is about @xmath133  photons s@xmath134 , or @xmath135 , for @xmath136 .",
    "however , it may very well be that this emission is beamed ; then for 1 steradian , the true luminosity would be @xmath137 .",
    "for comparison , our own galaxy emits @xmath138 .",
    "the overall characteristics of the observed spectrum in the @xmath2-ray regime suggest the presence of an extraordinary source of relativistic particles with an energy spectrum at least as hard as that observed for charged cosmic rays near earth .",
    "there is no way of knowing from the gro data whether this spectrum extends across the many additional decades to the extreme energy required by the extragalactic part of the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "many of the 20 agns detected by egret appear to have flat spectra and might be expected to be detected at tev energies ( weekes 1993 ) .",

    "it is assumed that the accretion disk surrounding the kbh is the two - temperature , bistable disk model [ also referred to as the thin disk / ion corona , and recently , the corona phase called an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ] .",
    "such an accretion disk can possibly exist in either phase , thin disk or ion torus , or both ( thin disk / ion corona)while oscillating between the two ( chen & taam 1996 ; narayan 1997 ; see also esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the two - temperature disk model was first proposed by shapiro , lightman and eardley ( 1976 ) to account for the _ high _ and _ low _ states of the galactic x - ray source cygnus x-1 . in the standard thin disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 )",
    ", it is assumed that the gas at each radius is in a nearly keplerian orbit .",
    "slow radial infall occurs as viscosity [ including magnetic ( eardley & lightman 1975 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) ] transfers angular momentum outward ; that is , the gas must give up some of its angular momentum before it can cross the event horizon . the binding energy released by accretion",
    "may then be retained by the gas of the disk in the form of heat or radiated away . an accretion flow which is able to radiate away most of its binding energy forms a thin accretion disk ; the alternative form is a geometrical thick disk or an ion corona  sometimes referred to as a hot torus ( rees et  al .",
    "the possible formation of a thick disk was first realized through lightman s ( 1974a , 1974b )",
    "investigation of the instability of a thin , time - dependent accretion disk around a black hole .",
    "his calculations show that as time progresses , density and thermal instabilities develop in the thin disk , causing the material to clump into high - density zones and low - density zones  that become optically thin , bringing about extremely high temperatures , which cause the vertical height @xmath158 of the inner region to rise quickly .",
    "however , without a satisfactory relativistic time - dependent model to treat @xmath159 , we can only speculate about properties of the disk as @xmath160 becomes relatively large . among these speculations",
    "are the following : ( 1 )  the rapidly rising internal temperatures could cause the temperature gradient to become superadiabatic , and thus , drive convective ( lightman 1974a ; narayan & yi 1994 ) or advective ( abramowicz et al . 1988 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1996 ) energy transport at a rate necessary to counterbalance the energy released , and an ion corona / hot torus ( or adaf ) forms in the inner radii .",
    "( 2 )  the rings probably destroy themselves by explosion or supersonic turbulence ( thorne & price 1975 ) , causing the density in the optically thin regions to once again rise , making cooling processes more efficient ; and after this , the disk will most likely settle back down to its thin disk structure , subsequently repeating the instability cycle .",
    "note , the above mentioned density and thermal instabilities are commonly referred to as the `` lightman instabilities . ''",
    "such stability and instability phases of the accretion disk , proposed in the items above , can generally be explained in the context of the accretion rate @xmath161 versus surface density @xmath162 plane ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "thin disks are primarily thermal emitters , with spectra peaking in the uv ; however , the inner region of a thin disk is capable of producing both an uv thermal component and a power law continuum , if surrounded by a corona ( hence , the thin disk / ion corona model ) , since the corona can be heated to temperatures @xmath163  k by the lightman instabilities .",
    "a detailed model of the thin disk ( without the lightman instabilities ) surrounding a kbh gives a surface temperature in the range of @xmath164  k ( @xmath165  kev ) to @xmath166  k ( @xmath167  kev ) for the inner region ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",
    "but once the instabilities set in , the ionized corona can have electron and proton temperatures as high as @xmath168  k and @xmath169  k , respectively ( shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ) . because of the high electron and ion ( or proton ) temperatures attainable in the corona , the basic output radiation is mostly nonthermal @xmath2-rays .",
    "the ion corona is a poor radiator ; and if the binding energy released is small , funnels can form about the polar axes , which could enable collimation and the formation of jets ( rees et  al . 1982 ) .",
    "in addition , it has been found independently by williams ( 1991 , paper  1 ) , and de felice and calvani ( 1972 ) ; de felice and curir ( 1992 ) , that the kbh naturally gives rise to vortical escaping orbits , which are collimated about the polar axis ; for example , the penrose scattered particles discussed here , as we shall see in   4 ,",
    "exhibit such collimation . from these findings , and a subsequent detailed analysis ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ) , one can safely say that the kbh is most likely responsible for the initial collimation of the jets .    before proceeding ,",
    "i want to pause briefly to explain the origin of this collimation .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the collimation is the inertial frame dragging , sometimes referred to as the lense - thirring effect : due to the gravitational force associated with a rotating mass  it is a purely general relativistic effect .",
    "this component of the gravitational force is sometimes called the  gravitomagnetic  force ( thorne , price , & macdonald 1986 ) ; it is the the gravitational analog of a magnetic field , which distorts spacetime and acts on the space momentum vector of a test particle in its field . the lense - thirring effect or the frame dragging is an intrinsic part of the penrose mechanism .",
    "inside the ergosphere , where penrose processes operate , as matter is made to rotate in the direction of the kbh , it acquires large angular momentum and energy from the black hole .",
    "the particles inside the ergosphere that have nonequatorially confined orbits will have in addition nonzero polar coordinate momenta ( wilkins 1972 ; paper  1 ; williams 2002a , 2001 ) .",
    "if these highly blueshifted particles were allowed to escape , they would escape along vortical trajectories , as point out by de felice & carlotto ( 1997 ) , i.e. , due to the inertial spacetime frame dragging of their orbits .",
    "these authors define such trajectories as gravitational spacetime `` geometry - induced collimation . ''",
    "generally , in these penrose processes , the incident particles , after scattering in the ergosphere , take with them the energy and momentum of the orbiting targets .",
    "this , along with the gravitomagnetic force , enables the escaping penrose scattered particles to leave the kbh in the form of vortically orbiting relativistic particles , collimated about the polar axis ( williams 2002a , 2001 ) . in summary ,",
    "the collimation is the characteristic structure of geodesic orbits escaping from the ergosphere or region close to the event horizon of a kbh : this is due to the lense - thirring effect , and , hence , is seen here in the four - momenta of these penrose scattered escaping particles .",
    "now continuing , on table  1 , model parameters are given for the inner region of a thin disk / ion corona two - temperature , bistable , fully relativistic accretion flow surrounding a kbh ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "these model parameters have been calculated from several sources ( novikov & thorne 1973 ; eardley & lightman 1975 ; eilek 1980 ; eilek & kafatos 1983 ) .",
    "note , eardley & lightman ( 1975 ) provide the conditions for instability to set in , i.e. , in going from a thin disk to adaf ( see appendix c of that paper ) .",
    "the parameters are defined as follows : @xmath171 is the viscosity parameter ( @xmath172 ) ; @xmath173 is the dimensionless parameter that characterizes comptonization , commonly called the kompaneets parameter ; @xmath174 is the sub - eddington accretion rate ; @xmath175 and @xmath176 are the thermal and surface temperatures , respectively ; @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the electron and ion temperatures , respectively ; @xmath179 and @xmath180 give approximate values for the extent of the inner region and the hot optically thin region of instability , respectively ; @xmath181 is the bolometric luminosity ; @xmath52 is the luminosity of the @xmath13-induced @xmath2-rays in the adaf ; and @xmath158 is the height of the disk .",

    "specifically , the regions @xmath179 and @xmath180 are calculated from eardley and lightman ( 1975 ) .",
    "moreover , notice the following : ( 1 ) increasing @xmath171 , the viscosity parameter , as in model cases 3 and  6 , decreases @xmath175 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and increases @xmath176 , @xmath52 , and the extents of the regions @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",

    "subsequently , the target electron may recoil to another direct orbit of lesser energy ( defined as a @xmath197-penrose process ) , or the electron may be put on a retrograde orbit of negative energy ( a classical penrose process ) ; in both cases , the target electron gives up energy as measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "however , to a particular local  frame observer this is just a normal compton scattering process in which the photon loses energy to the electron , since the photon arrives at the local  frame with initial energy higher than @xmath198 .    putting the pcs results ( discussed in details in paper  1 ) into an astrophysical context , it is concluded that this process may play an important role in the upgrading of uv photons @xmath31  ev , say from a thin disk / ion corona accretion , to x - ray photons @xmath199  kev ; and in upgrading soft x - ray / hard x - ray photons @xmath200  kev , also from a thin disk / ion corona accretion , to hard x - ray/@xmath2-ray photons",
    "@xmath201  kev@xmath34@xmath202  mev : contributing to the high energy observed spectra of agns .",
    "in addition , because many of the escaping @xmath2-rays have negative radial momenta ( out from the @xmath203 plane ) and nonzero polar and azimuthal coordinate angular momenta , these @xmath2-rays could possible aid , along with magnetic fields and relativistic electrons , in the formation of the observed astrophysical jets commonly seen in agns ( see williams 2002a ) .",
    "such vortical - like escaping orbits which are naturally collimated about the axis of symmetry ( the rotation axis ) due to the spin of the kbh have been described by de felice and curir ( 1992 ) and de felice and carlotto ( 1997 ) .",
    "their description gives support to the penrose theoretical model calculations presented in this present paper .",
    "a detailed discussion of these vortical orbits produced in penrose processes is given by williams ( 2002b ; see also 2001 ) .",
    "features of the pcs photons are shown in the energy - momentum spectra of figures  2 and  3 .",
    "the radial and azimuthal momentum components are plotted in figures  2@xmath28 and  2@xmath139 for a typical pcs of 2000 incoming photons . depicted in figure  3 are polar momentum components for two pcs cases .",
    "compare figures  3@xmath28 and 3@xmath139 ; notice the asymmetry in the polar directions : the one - sided distribution favors the positive @xmath85-direction .",
    "this feature could be extremely important in jet formation ( paper  1 ) .",
    "such asymmetry in the distribution of the scattered particles is a general relativistic effect , due to the gravitomagnetic ( gm ) field , which causes the extreme dragging of inertial frames in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole , and exerts a force on the momentum vector of a particle in its field ( williams 2002a , 1999 ) , as mentioned earlier .",
    "williams ( 2002a ) presents a detailed investigation of the gravitomagnetic field and penrose processes , showing that the gm field alters incident and outgoing angles of the penrose scattered particles , appearing to break the reflection symmetry of the kerr metric above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "this asymmetry , due to the gm field , has recently been confirmed by an independent analysis ( bini et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the corresponding polar angles of the escaping particles , above and below the equatorial plane ( @xmath203 ) , as measured by an observer at infinity , for the cases in figure  3 , are displayed in figure  4 .",
    "these polar angles are derived from equation  ( 4 ) by letting @xmath204 ( see also piran & shaham 1977a ) ; thus , in general , @xmath205 } ^{1/2 } , \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 ( @xmath207 is measured relative to the equatorial plane ) .",
    "figures  2@xmath28 , 3 and  4 show that the kbh scatters most of the photons into the polar direction , at an angle @xmath208 ( @xmath209 , for escaping above `` @xmath34 '' or below `` @xmath35 '' the equatorial plane , where @xmath210 is given by eq .  [ 6 ] ) , and naturally produces one - sided jets of particles ; see williams ( 2002a ) for details .",
    "moreover , the particles that are scattered with nonzero azimuthal and nonzero polar coordinate momentum components ( compare figs .",
    "2@xmath139 and  3@xmath139 ) give rise to vortical orbits concentric about the polar axis , with corresponding polar angles of escape ( fig .",
    "4@xmath139 ) indicating a coil - like collimation ( williams 2002b , 2001 ) .",
    "note that , photons escaping with the highest energy , after being scattered by the nonequatorially confined orbiting target electrons , have polar angles of escape approximately equal to that of the maximum latitudinal angle  relative to the equatorial plane  of the target electrons ( @xmath211 ; compare fig .  4@xmath139 , and see   4.4 for further explanation of the latitudinal angle ) .",
    "similarly , the highest energy pcs photons by equatorially confined target electrons have @xmath212 values near the equatorial plane ( compare fig .",
    "4@xmath28 ) .",
    "the calculated luminosity spectra resulting from the above described pcs processes are presented in   5 , where they are compared with observations .",
    "this ppp ( @xmath3 ) consists of collisions inside the ergosphere , between radially infalling photons and bound circularly orbiting photons , at the radius of the photon orbit ( bardeen et al .",
    "1972 ) : @xmath213 } \\rbrace , \\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 represents an unstable circular orbit .",
    "this orbit is the innermost boundary of circular orbits for particles i.e. , for massless particles ( the marginally bound orbit @xmath21 is the innermost orbit for material particles ) .",
    "the initial energies used in these calculations , as measured by an observer at infinity , for the infalling photon and the orbiting photon , @xmath214 and @xmath215 , respectively , are in the following ranges : @xmath216  mev and @xmath217  gev [ defined by eqs .",
    "( a20 ) and  ( a21 ) of paper  1 for given @xmath82 values ] .",
    "these ranges are consistent with those produced by thin disk / ion corona models .",
    "the high energy range for @xmath215 is chosen based on the expected blueshift in the energy of a photon at the photon orbit ( recall from   [ sec : intro ] that the blueshift factor at the photon orbit for a kbh with @xmath77 is @xmath218 ) .",
    "the @xmath2-rays produced in eilek s hot accretion disk model ( eilek 1980 ; eilek & kafatos 1983 ) , with energies up to @xmath219  mev , can very well be seed photons ( now blueshifted and bound at the photon orbit ) for these ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes ( eilek 1991 ) .",
    "in addition , some of the pcs photons , described in the last section , can also be seed particles for these processes ( paper  1 ) . the target photons having orbital energies , @xmath215 , within the range given above , have corresponding @xmath82 values within the range of @xmath220 , and their maximum latitudinal orbiting angles ( relative to the equatorial plane ) are @xmath221 , as given by equation  ( 6 ) , irrespective of their individual values of @xmath215 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 .",
    "the results of these ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes ( paper  1 ) , and the calculated luminosity presented in   5 , show that this can be an important way , if not the dominant way , to extract the extremely relativistic @xmath4 pairs that are inferred from observations to be emerging from the cores of agns .",
    "note that , these ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes are classified as quasi - penrose processes ( paper  1 ) .",
    "that is , the target particle is not specifically put on a negative energy orbit as in the classical penrose extraction of rotational energy , yet rotational energy is still extracted , however , indirectly , from the highly energetic photons , that have been blueshifted by the kbh , at ( or near ) the photon orbit ; see paper  1 for further details .    in general , a possible picture of what takes place in these ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes to an observer at infinity ( i.e. , the blf ) is the following : low energy unbound infalling photons interact with high energy bound photons at the photon orbit producing pairs of relativistic electrons with energies as high as @xmath224  gev or higher  depending on the type of accretion flow ; about @xmath225 of these produced @xmath6 pairs escape from the potential well of the kbh .",
    "typical radial and azimuthal energy - momentum spectra of the @xmath6 pairs are shown in figure  5 .",
    "these copiously produced relativistic escaping electrons can participate in astrophysical processes intrinsic to observations of agns , such as the production of the synchrotron radiation and the formation of the jets .",
    "notice in figure 5@xmath28 that only the positive radially directed @xmath6 pairs escape ; this is to be expected since all negatively directed material particles at radii less than @xmath21 must fall directly into the kbh .",
    "also , it is important to note here that if these ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes had not occurred , photons in the photon orbit would , most likely , not have had any other way of escaping , and the energy released in these processes would have been forever trapped by the kbh .",
    "the reason for this is given by bardeen et al .",
    "it is pointed out that , in order for a photon to escape from the circular photon orbit , since nothing can come out of the hole , some physical process near the hole is necessary to inject a particle into an escaping trajectory , i.e. , from a plunging orbit into an escaping one",
    ".    depicted in figure  6 are polar coordinate momentum components for various ppp ( @xmath3 ) cases ; the corresponding angles of escape , of the @xmath6 pairs , above and below the equatorial plane , as given by equation  ( 6 ) , are shown in figure  7 .",
    "notice in figures  6 and  7 , the increase in the asymmetry of the @xmath6 pair distributions as the escaping energies increase ; this is consistent with the effects caused by the gm field ( williams 2002a ) .",
    "moreover , such one - sidedness could be an important factor in explaining the asymmetry in the observed jets of agns .",
    "thus , as in the pcs case , we find that the kbh in these ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes naturally produces uneven fluxes of relativistic particles above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "in addition , also as in the pcs , we find that the @xmath6 pairs escape along vortical orbits concentric about the polar axis , and highest energy pairs escape with polar helical angle @xmath226 ( eq .  [ 6 ] ) ; this suggests strong coil - like jet collimation ( williams 2002b , 2001 ) .",
    "note that , this angle of escape for the highest energy @xmath6 pairs is approximately equal to that of the maximum latitudinal angle  relative to the equatorial plane  of the target nonequatorially confined orbiting photons ( compare figure  7 ; and see   4.4 for further explanation of the latitudinal angle ) .",
    "the above findings are consistent with observations of agns . in the following sections ,",
    "i shall discuss further this ppp ( @xmath3 ) and its probable role in astrophysical black hole sources .      in the pcs and ppp ( @xmath3 )",
    "processes considered in this paper , the lowest energies ( @xmath227  kev@xmath228  kev ) used for the infalling photons are consistent with the surface temperature ( @xmath229  k @xmath34 @xmath166  k , at @xmath230 , for @xmath231 ) of the classical thin disk accretion model about a kbh ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",
    "now , the scenario for a @xmath232 kbh , surrounded by a classical thin disk ( i.e. , before the lightman instabilities set in ) is the following .",
    "about 80% of the initially infalling soft x - rays ( @xmath233  kev ) , that have undergone pcs by equatorially confined orbiting target electrons ( at @xmath234 , @xmath235  mev ) , can escape with boosted energies as high as hard x - rays ( @xmath236  mev ) , while the others either fall into the kbh , or become bound ( i.e. , with a turning point ) at the photon orbit  acquiring blueshifted energies as high as @xmath237  mev .",
    "the polar coordinate momentum components @xmath238 of the scattered photons reveal that indeed such pcs photons can acquire the necessary @xmath82 values to populate the photon orbit by the criteria discussed in paper  1 [ i.e. , the @xmath82 value must match that of the photon orbit whose energy is consistent with the expected blueshifted energy , within reason , as defined by equation  ( 2.26 ) of paper  1 ; see also discussion in williams ( 2002a ) ] .",
    "these blueshifted photons , now assuming to have populated the photon orbit , can undergo ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes with infalling soft x - rays [ for maximum absolute efficiency ( paper  1 ) ] , producing @xmath6 pairs with energies as high as @xmath239  mev . about half of the produced pairs escape along vortical helical - like orbits collimated about the polar axis .",
    "the helical angle of escape @xmath240 , defined relative to the equatorial plane ( see equation  [ 6 ] and fig .",
    "7@xmath28 ) , is @xmath241 down to @xmath242 for the highest energy particles , implying strong coil - like collimation ( williams 2001 , 2002b ) .",
    "thus , i conclude , that , due to pcs and ppp ( @xmath3 ) processes , in a classical thin disk , the highest particle energies attainable for the pcs photons are @xmath243  kev ( hard x - rays ) ; and for the relativistic ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons , the highest energies attainable are @xmath239  mev . yet , without these penrose processes , as can be seen above from the surface temperature @xmath176 , the highest energy radiated by a classical thin disk surrounding a supermassive kbh is @xmath233  kev , and , of course , no pair production ( compare table  1 ) .",
    "since the disk can exist between two phases [ thin disk / ion corona ( or hot torus ) ] the occurrence of the lightman instabilities can act to enhance the penrose process , thereby contributing to observed variabilities and particle energies up to @xmath1  gev .",
    "we shall see this in the following scenario for a @xmath232 kbh surrounded by a thin disk / ion corona . in this scenario , x - rays ( @xmath244 ) , after undergoing pcs by equatorially confined orbiting target electrons , can escape with boosted energies ranging from @xmath245  mev up to @xmath246  mev . just as in the classical thin disk , about @xmath247 of the pcs photons",

    "now we assume that the photon orbit can be populated in addition by @xmath2-rays from the @xmath13 decays ( @xmath250 ) , occurring in eilek s ( 1980 ) ion corona / hot torus model ( discussed in    1 , 4.2 , and paper  1 ) .",
    "these @xmath2-rays are created with energies narrowly peaked around @xmath251 mev .",
    "such @xmath2-rays can be blueshifted to energies @xmath224  gev , as they become populated or bound at the photon orbit . subsequently ,",
    "infalling soft x - rays from the disk can undergo ppp ( @xmath3 ) with these now bound @xmath2-rays , producing @xmath6 pairs that can escape with energies up to @xmath224  gev .",
    "recently , it has been shown that if the proton distribution in eilek s hot torus model ( or adaf ) is a power law , the energy of the @xmath2-rays , produced by the @xmath13 decays , can reach energies @xmath252  mev ( mahadevan , narayan , & krolik 1997 ) . therefore , since the blueshift is @xmath218 at the photon orbit , the ppp ( @xmath3 ) can produce @xmath6 pairs with energies @xmath253  gev .",
    "however , here in this present analysis only the @xmath2-ray particles from eilek s model , with energies @xmath254  mev , before becoming blueshifted , need to be considered .",
    "such infalling particles allow these penrose processes to explain the @xmath2-ray spectra of 3c 279 and 3c 273 .",
    "note , assuming that eilek s particles ( or particles from adafs ) will acquire the necessary @xmath82 value appears to be a valid assumption , based on the fact that the pcs photons acquire the necessary @xmath82 value to populate the photon orbit .",
    "that is , one would expect the proton - proton nuclear reaction @xmath13 emission ( eilek & kafatos 1983 ; mahadevan et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the subsequent @xmath13 decay : @xmath250 , to be penrose processes , and thus , the @xmath13-induced @xmath2-rays are expected to acquire the appropriate @xmath82 values . however",
    ", confirmation of this will have to await a penrose process analysis of these reactions in the ergosphere of a kbh ( williams & eilek 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , if we assume that pairs produced in eilek s hot torus model , which have energies peaked around @xmath255 mev , can populate the nonequatorially confined target electron orbits , say in the range of @xmath256 mev , then pcs of infalling soft x - ray / uv photons from the disk allows most of the scattered photons to escape with boosted energies up to @xmath257  mev : this value is consistent with one of the general cutoffs observed in the spectra of quasars ( compare fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that , such target electrons have nonequatorially confined ( @xmath193 ) `` spherical - like '' orbits ( wilkins 1972 ) , and reach latitudinal angles in their orbits @xmath258 , above and below the equatorial plane , as given by equation  ( 6 ) .",
    "the relevant algebra to determine the conserved energy @xmath81 and azimuthal angular momentum @xmath58 for these nonequatorially confined spherical - like orbits , for massless and material test particles , can be found in paper  1 ( see also williams 2002a ) .",
    "one of these spherical - like orbits consists of a particle repeatedly passing through the equatorial plane while tracing out a helical belt lying on a sphere at constant radius .",
    "the belt width or the maximum and minimum latitudes that the particle achieves , in general , increase with increasing @xmath82 ( this does not appear to be true for massless particles bound at the photon orbit ; see   4.2.2 ) .",
    "now , these pcs @xmath2-rays up to @xmath257  mev could contribute to the observed spectra in this energy range ( as will be shown in   5 ) .",
    "the importance of these pcs @xmath2-rays is that they can acquire and escape with large polar and azimuthal coordinate momenta ( implicating collimation ) , thus supporting the jet formation process ( compare figs .  2 , 3@xmath139 and 4@xmath139 ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that these nonequatorially confined target electron orbits can be populated by prior ppp ( @xmath3 ) , up to @xmath259  mev ( williams 2003 ) .",
    "these energies of the escaping penrose scattered particles are to be compared with maximum energies attainable for the popular two - temperature accretion disk models ( shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ; lightman & eardley 1974 ) , such as thin disk / ion corona ( adaf ) . in these disk models , without penrose processes occurring , the maximum particle energies attainable are @xmath14  mev for a thermal distribution of protons ( eilek 1980 ) , and up to @xmath260  gev for a power law distribution of protons ( mahadevan , narayan , & krolik 1997 ) . however ,",
    "when the penrose processes pcs and ppp ( @xmath3 ) are included , particles can possibly escape with energies as high as @xmath224  gev up to @xmath261  gev ( attempting to go beyond this value causes the computer code to breakdown , suggesting that the model is attempting to go beyond what is physically possible ) .",
    "in addition , since the luminosity of the escaping @xmath13-induced @xmath2  rays is so low for adafs , due to the bulk of energy being advected radially into the hole , rather than being radiated away , penrose processes appear needed in order for the high energy particles to escape in the form of jets ( i.e. , with the penrose scattered particles being collimated about the polar axis naturally by the kbh ) .",
    "such particles , as have been found in these calculations , were proposed to exist in de felice and curir s ( 1992 ) analysis of the kerr geometry .",
    "the penrose model calculations presented here and elsewhere ( williams 1991 , paper  1 , 2002a , 1999 ) appear to strongly validate their analysis , as well as the analysis by bini et al .",
    "( 2002 ) : concerning the asymmetry in the spherical - like ( or nonequatorially confined ) particle orbits ( wilkins 1972 ) , above and below the equatorial plane , due to the gm field .",
    "further analysis of the first order perturbation in latitudinal angles @xmath262 , @xmath263 ( bini et al . 2002 ) should reveal that the asymmetry is directly related to the first order perturbation in the constant radius @xmath42 of the spherical - like orbit [ see eq .",
    "( 47 ) of williams ( 2002a ) ] , and , thus , overall related to the hard evidence that the gm field breaks the expected reflection equatorial planar symmetry of the kerr metric ( williams 1999 ) .",
    "relativistic inverse compton scattering of the pcs photons , or accretion disk photons , by the ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons is an important secondary process , which i refer to as `` secondary '' penrose compton scattering ( spcs ) . in general , the energy of a compton scattered photon is given by ( kafatos 1980 ) @xmath264 or @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the lorentz factor of the electrons ( in this case , @xmath267 ) , and @xmath268 is the original energy of the photon .",
    "it turns out that most of the `` secondary '' penrose compton scattered ( spcs ) photons satisfy the relation of equation  ( 9 ) for relativistic compton scattering .",
    "for example , for ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons with energies @xmath246  mev , all pcs photon or disk photons with energies as high as @xmath236  mev satisfy equation  ( 9 ) ; and for electron pairs with energies @xmath269  mev , all pcs photons or disk photons with energies above @xmath270  mev satisfy equation  ( 9 ) .    in the calculated luminosity spectra of the penrose processes , presented in   5 , the electrons produced by the ppp ( @xmath3 )",
    "are allowed to undergo spcs with infalling photons from the accretion disk .",
    "the acquired numerically ( monte carlo ) calculated energies of the spcs photons are not much different from the maximum attainable energies given by equation  ( 9 ) . in the spcs ,",
    "the numerical calculations are similar to those used for the pcs ( paper  1 ) , except now the ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons are used for the targets .",
    "an important aspect of the above secondary process is beamed relativistic expansion or commonly called relativistic beaming , i.e. , when high energy radiation due to compton scattering is beamed into the polar directions by means of relativistic electrons emanating from the central source  such as the ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons .",
    "such ppp electrons , which are initially collimated by the kbh , and subsequently , perhaps , accelerated by shocks in the gas motions and electromagnetic fields , can possibly give rise to the observed astrophysical jets .",
    "in relativistic beaming models , the bulk motion of the electrons ( i.e. , of a given blob of electrons ) is assumed to move with relativistic speed .",
    "superluminal motion , produced by relativistic beaming , becomes important if the jet makes a small angle up to @xmath271 with the line of sight of the observer .",
    "such motion , in so - called superluminal sources , can display apparent jet velocities greater than the speed of light , and can enhance the observed brightness , energy , and variability of the source .",
    "some theoretical relations for relativistic beaming from various authors , relevant to these present model calculations , are as follows .",
    "the relation between the scattered photon energy @xmath272 and the original photon energy @xmath268 is given by ( dermer et  al .",

    "equation  ( 10 ) is for scattering in the thomson regime , i.e. , for @xmath277 ( sikora , begelman , & rees 1994 ) .",
    "the energy of the scattered photon in the klein - nishina regime , i.e. , for @xmath278 is given by ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ) @xmath279 notice that equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) reduce to equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) , respectively , when @xmath280 and @xmath281 , as would be expected .",
    "the apparent velocity of the blob in the jet as measured by an observer at infinity is given by ( blandford , mckee , & rees 1977 ) @xmath282    the observed luminosity @xmath283 relative to the intrinsic luminosity @xmath284 is given by ( maraschi , ghisellini , & celotti 1992 ) @xmath285 where @xmath286^{-1}$ ] is the usual doppler factor , and @xmath287 ( @xmath288 ; @xmath289 flux spectral index ) is between 3 and  4 .    for completion , an estimation of the intrinsic size @xmath290 of the @xmath2-ray emitting region",

[ 9 ] ) ; @xmath298 ; @xmath299 for @xmath300 and @xmath301 ; note , equations  ( 11 ) through  ( 13 ) have been used .",
    "thus , one can see from the above parameters that relativistic beaming near the observers line of sight is indeed an effective enhancement mechanism . however , the relativistic beaming models must rely on some preliminary mechanism to create and collimate the relativistic electrons about the polar axis of the agn . according to the model calculations presented in this paper ,",
    "the penrose process suggests the perfect preliminary mechanism .",
    "this mechanism has been shown ( paper  1 ) to produce relativistic electrons ( @xmath266 up to at least @xmath5 ) , with vortical escaping orbits about the polar axis ( de felice and curir 1992 ; de felice and carlotto 1997 ; williams 2002b ) , that have asymmetrical distributions above and below the equatorial plane  leading to asymmetrical jets ( williams 2002a ) .",

    ": in general , the radio / mm emission may be due to the interaction of a magnetic field @xmath402 , say of the accretion disk ( @xmath403  gauss ) , with electrons of the disk or ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons .",
    "for example , for electrons with energies between @xmath404  mev , the synchrotron frequency of the emitted photons will be @xmath405  hz , where @xmath406 ( burbidge , jones , & odell 1974 ) .",

    "of course eilek s ( 1980 ) @xmath409 pairs , with energies peaking @xmath410  mev , could also contribute synchrotron radiation to the spectrum in this regime .",
    "moreover , the accretion disk radiates thermal photons in this region of the spectrum , with maximum radiation peaking from @xmath411 to @xmath412  hz .",
    "this thermal radiation is due to viscosity in the disk as angular momentum is transferred outward , thereby heating the disk , producing copious photons .",
    "particularly , in the optical band , this is most likely the dominant observed emission for `` normal '' quasars , but not for ovv quasars , like 3c 279 . for the case of ovv quasars ,",
    "the observed optical emission is probably dominated by synchrotron emission in the jet , since , in these sources , the jet is believed to be pointed in a direction near the observer s line of sight ; this gives rise to observed features , such as intense variability and high polarization in the optical emission .",
    "the x - ray emission ( @xmath413  kev ) can be produced by both pcs and the inner region of a thin disk / ion corona accretion . in general , for a @xmath16 kbh , the pcs has emission over the total x - ray band , and so does the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "however , from comparing figure  8@xmath28 , the accretion disk appears to be the more dominant mechanism in producing the observed x - ray emission of 3c  279 ( i.e. , if we limit the photons participating in the pcs to be only those from the observed soft x - ray spectrum we believe to be disk radiation ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned earlier , the x - ray emission may be predominantly beamed pcs .",
    "this is not the case for 3c  273 ( compare fig .",
    "8@xmath139 ; more on this below ) .",
    "the soft @xmath2-ray emission can be produced by infalling x - ray photons @xmath23  kev ( @xmath414  k ) from a thin disk / ion corona accretion ; such infalling disk x - rays can first undergo pcs ( see fig .",
    "3@xmath28 ) , producing photons that can populate the photon orbit for ppp ( @xmath3 ) ( williams 2002a , 2002b ) ; these pairs can subsequently undergo spcs with additional infalling disk photons , producing @xmath2-rays in the range @xmath415  mev , peaking in luminosity at @xmath416  mev ( or @xmath417  hz ) .",
    "the soft @xmath2-ray emission can also be produced directly by the pcs photons ( see figs .  2 and 3@xmath139 ) , with energies extending up to , say , @xmath239  mev ( or @xmath418  hz ) .",
    "the cutoff of the observed soft @xmath2-ray emission is probably due to the inability of prior pcs to populate the photon orbit  for ppp ( leading to spcs ) , and/or the inability , or unavailability , of higher energy electrons to populate the nonequatorially confined target particle orbits  for pcs [ from ion corona nuclear reaction processes (    [ sec : ppp ] and  [ sec : corona ] ) ] .",
    "the higher energy @xmath2-ray emission [ up to @xmath224  gev ( @xmath419  hz ) ] can be produced exclusively by the ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons ( i.e. , after some of the ppp electrons have undergone spcs processes ) .",
    "these processes can contribute copious photons to the observed @xmath2-ray emission spectrum , and is probably responsible for the large luminosities at very high energies ( compare figs .",
    "1@xmath28 and  8@xmath28 ) .",
    "any observable fall off in the hard @xmath2-ray regime is probably due to the increasingly smaller cross section at higher energies .",
    "note , it appears that the @xmath2-rays produced by the @xmath250 decays (    [ sec : ppp ] and 4.4 ) , satisfying conditions to populate the photon orbit for ppp ( @xmath3 ) , can safely be predicted to have energies @xmath420  mev , based on observations : such @xmath2-rays will acquire gravitational blueshifted energies @xmath421  mev , with expected @xmath82 values @xmath422 .    if the radiation is preferentially beamed towards us , we will overestimate the true luminosity and energy , depending on the observing angle , @xmath276 (   4.5.2 ) .",
    "this does not pose a problem for this present model , because the luminosity and energy could undergo an apparent shift and still be described by these penrose processes .",
    "moreover , according to equations  ( 11 ) through  ( 14 ) , if the observing angle is @xmath423 , and the lorentz factor of the blob is @xmath294 , implying a doppler boost of @xmath424 , then the energy will shift by a factor of @xmath425 ( increasing from an intrinsic energy of , say , @xmath426  gev to an apparent energy of @xmath224  gev ) , and the intrinsic luminosity shifts upward by a factor of @xmath427 , with @xmath300 , to its observed value .",
    "the apparent velocity would be @xmath428 , consistent with observations ( @xmath429 for 3c  279 ; porcas 1987 ) , and , for completion , the intrinsic size of the emitting region , say in the @xmath2-ray @xmath252  mev (   3.2)for a variability time scale of @xmath30 a day , will be @xmath430  pc@xmath431 , where @xmath432 ( @xmath433 ) is the so - called gravitational radius .    referring now to figures  1@xmath139 and 8@xmath139 , to discuss the total observed spectrum of 3c  273 : the emission in the radio to uv region of the spectrum",
    "can probably be explained by the same processes as described above for 3c 279 , i.e. , penrose , accretion disk , and synchrotron emission processes . in the x - ray regime ,",
    "particularly , from @xmath434 to  207  kev ( @xmath435 to @xmath436  hz ) , the emission spectrum is probably produced by pcs and the inner region of an ion corona accretion disk ( compare fig .",
    "8@xmath139 ) .",
    "since the x - ray emission extends to much greater than @xmath233  kev , which is the maximum energy produced by the inner region of a thin disk , then we conclude that the ion corona and pcs are most likely producing the hard x - rays .",
    "since the accretion can exist in either or both of two phases : thin disk and/or ion corona , and can remain in any of these phases for an indefinite time , depending on the cooling mechanism , it is possible that quasar 3c 273 is spending its `` lifetime '' largely in the ion corona / hot torus ( or the adaf ) phase .",
    "this is contrary to 3c 279 , which , as observations suggest , spends its lifetime oscillation between the thin disk and ion corona phases , on a relatively small timescale ( further comparisons of the spectra of 3c 279 and 3c 273 are presented in the following section ) .",
    "an explanation for the observed @xmath2-ray emission spectrum is as follows ( compare fig .",
    "8@xmath139 ) .",
    "the @xmath2-ray emission from @xmath111 to @xmath437  mev ( @xmath438 to @xmath439  hz ) is most likely due to a mixture of pcs and relativistic spcs by the ppp ( @xmath3 ) electrons , as described above for the soft @xmath2-ray emission in 3c  279 .",
    "the @xmath2-ray emission from @xmath239  mev up to @xmath224  gev is probably due predominantly to spcs .",
    "some of the @xmath2-ray emission , at least in the regions between @xmath440  mev , may be due to eilek s particles (   4.4 ) , as indicated in figure  1@xmath139 . finally , relativistic beaming may serve to boost the overall @xmath2-ray emission , depending on the observing angle , since superluminal motion has been detected in observations of 3c  273 ( porcas 1987 ) .",
    "now we compare further the spectra of 3c  279 and 3c  273 , again using figures  1 and  8 .",
    "the classification of these quasars as radio loud is evident from their spectra in the radio / mm region .",
    "the shape of the spectrum of 3c  273 looks like the `` enhanced '' spectrum of 3c  279 , except for the higher luminosities in 3c  279 and the radio tail in 3c  273 . the higher luminosity and the lack of a radio tail in 3c  279",
    "is probably largely due to the radiation of 3c  279 being beamed more in the direction of the observer than the radiation of 3c  273 .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of 3c  279 has been doppler ( i.e. , apparently ) blueshifted to a higher energy interval , and the luminosity has been apparently increased (   4.5.2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with radio observations which detect more superluminal motion ( or relativistic beaming near the line of sight of the observer ) in 3c  279 than in 3c  273 ( porcas 1987 ) .",
    "next , notice on the schematic broad band spectral diagrams of 3c  279 and 3c  273 ( fig .  1 ) , the region which i have labeled as the `` inner accretion disk , '' the emission of 3c 273 is hotter , covering a broader band of emission than 3c  279 .",
    "this to be expected if 3c 273 is in a predominantly ion torus ( or advection dominated ) state , as opposed to 3c 279 ( which appears to oscillates in a highly variable fashion between the thin disk and ion corona phases  for this reason 3c  279 is classified as an ovv quasar ) .",
    "moreover , the hotter state of the accretion disk ( ion torus ) , which is heated by a runaway thermal instability (   4 ) , would result in enhanced penrose processes [ pcs and ppp ( @xmath3 ) ] and enhanced synchrotron radiation due to the presence of more relativistic electrons and @xmath2-ray photons .",
    "this appears to be the case always in the continuum emission of 3c  273 and sometimes in the emission spectrum of 3c  279 , with 3c  279 not quite achieving the full ion torus status of 3c  273 ( compare fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus in summary , the differences in the spectra of 3c  279 and 3c  273 are probably due to ( 1 ) the more beaming effect in 3c  279 , and ( 2 ) the predominantly ion torus phase of 3c  273 .",
    "the results of these penrose processes allow one to make a brief statement on the evolution of radio loud and radio quiet quasars . since radio loud galaxies are usually associated with large elliptical galaxies with radio lobes , and assuming that quasars are progenitors of at least some galaxies ( particularly nearby agns ) , it is perhaps safe to say that radio loud galaxies evolve from radio loud quasars",
    ". this is based on observations and the model presented in this paper , suggesting that radio loud quasars have geometrically larger , more effective ion tori ( or coronas ) than their counterparts , radio quiet quasars , which probably possess cooler thin disks with small coronas ( if any ) .",
    "the hot thick disks proposed for radio loud quasars are expected to contain more relativistic electrons ( @xmath441 ) , thus leading to more synchrotron radiation in the radio , and the geometric thickness possibly creates the environment for funneling and collimating the emitted particles into jets ( as it appears to be the cases for 3c 279 and 3c  273 ) .",
    "so , in this scenario , radio loud quasars , which are believed to possess ion tori , eventually evolve into `` bright '' elliptical galaxies ; and the degree of radio loudness will depend on the phase of the stabilizing mode of the ion torus .",
    "now on the other hand , radio quiet galaxies are usually associated with spiral galaxies , in which large - scale collimated radio jets are absent ( kotanyi , hummel , & van gorkom 1987 ) .",
    "however , observations of spiral galaxies show some evidence of radio emission strictly confined to the optical disk . these observations are consistent with the model presented in this paper .",
    "this model suggests that radio quiet quasars may have thin disks , as mentioned above , with geometrically smaller ion coronas , if any , than radio loud quasars .",
    "this suggestion implies that radio quiet quasars eventually evolve into bright spiral galaxies , with radio and optical emission being confined to the disk .",
    "that is , without the presence of a geometrically larger ion torus to perhaps maintain the collimation of the jet as in radio loud quasars ( the initial collimation due to penrose processes may not be able to do it alone ) , a radio quiet quasar results , which may eventually evolve into an agn - type spiral galaxy , lenticular galaxy , or maybe even elliptical galaxy , depending on the size of the geometrically smaller ion torus .",
    "i have presented a model that can possible explain the observed features in the continuum spectra of 3c 279 and 3c 273 : using penrose processes [ pcs and ppp ( @xmath3 ) ] , a thin disk / ion corona ( or adaf ) , and a magnetic field strength ( @xmath442  gauss ) like that typically assumed for an accretion disk surrounding a kbh .",
    "i have demonstrated that the general spectra of agns in the high energy regime can be explained by this model with or without evoking relativistic beaming .",
    "this makes this model feasible to explain the general emission spectrum of any agn , irrespective of the observing angle , whereas , many other models to date must rely on relativistic beaming .",
    "now , when relativistic beaming is observed to be important , such as through superluminal motion , then it can be incorporated into the modeling of the source to reproduce its unique spectrum .",
    "for example , relativistic beaming seems to be more important in 3c  279 than in 3c  273 .",
    "that is , when relativistic beaming is included in the modeling of these sources , and 3c 279 is given a smaller observing angle relative to the axis of the jet , it increases the observed luminosity and energy relative to the spectrum of 3c 273 ; this is consistent with what we observe ( compare the @xmath2-ray luminosities of figs .",
    "1@xmath28 and  1@xmath139 ) .",
    "moreover , when relativistic beaming is included and a power law spectrum for the protons in adafs is assumed , which can yield @xmath2-rays due to the @xmath13 decays with energies @xmath443  gev ( mahadevan et al . 1997 ) , this present model , using the ppp ( @xmath3 ) and such @xmath2-rays , can explain the @xmath30  tev @xmath2-ray observations of the blazar mrk  421 .",
    "for example , when the blueshift at the photon orbit is taken into account for these @xmath13-induced @xmath2-rays , the ppp ( @xmath3 ) can yield lorentz factors as high as @xmath444 for the blobs . if we choose @xmath445 to be @xmath446 ( see eqs .  [",
    "10 ] to  [ 14 ] ) , such blobs when viewed at an observing angle @xmath447 will emit @xmath2-rays with apparent energies @xmath246   tev .",
    "importantly , the model presented here applies to all mass size black holes , which includes stellar mass black holes as well .",
    "for example , the observations of the classical stellar / galactic black - hole candidate cygnus x-1 , the bright seyfert  1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 , and the active giant elliptical galaxy m87 can all be explained by these penrose processes [ see williams ( 2002b ) for qualitative descriptions ] .",
    "details of the collimating effects of these penrose processes , and accelerating processes due to the associated electromagnetic field , which can possibly extend the jets out to very large distances , will be investigated in future work by the author .",
    "further , local acceleration due to strong shocks , similar to the models suggested by blandford and eichler ( 1987 ) , may be important also as the jets expand relativistically outward .",
    "such models should be investigated using the distributions of these penrose scattered particles .",
    "in addition , i have argued in this paper that instability in the accretion disk , which can cause the disk to vary between thin disk and ion corona ( or hot torus ) phases , plays a significant role in determining the morphology of quasars , possibly creating the two general classes : radio loud and radio quiet quasars .",
    "it is probable that such quasars eventually evolve into radio loud and radio quiet galaxies .",
    "however , these suggestions need to be investigated further .    finally , i point out , the consistency of this present model with observations of black hole sources , in general , shows its universal application : suggesting it to be a complete theory in the extraction of energy - momentum from a black hole .",

    "as referenced in the main text , examples of results of williams ( paper  1 ; 2002b ) being duplicated are discussed in the following items :    \\1 .",
    "gammie ( 1999 ) and krolik ( 1999 ) present black hole physics ( in varying degrees ) already presented in williams ( paper  1 ) penrose process analysis , particularly , ( a ) the general method used to extract energy , ( b ) the final resulting equations due to inertial frame dragging showing that energy is extracted , ( c ) the knowledge of the existence of particle orbits in the ergosphere inside the radius of marginal stability @xmath22 , and ( d ) application of the general conserved energy @xmath81 and azimuthal momentum @xmath58 parameters as they relate to the particle s orbit , inside the ergosphere , in a kerr metric ( see appendix a of paper  1 ) , in their effort to make the blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) type models work . specifically , they consider a magnetic torque being applied to the disk particles at @xmath448 ( krolik 1999 ) .    in gammie s ( 1999 )",

    "( 1989 ) , he defines an `` efficiency '' of magnetic accretion : @xmath449 for @xmath450 , implying that energy is extracted , where @xmath451 , normalized to @xmath452 ( in his calculations ) , is defined as the conserved `` rest mass flux , '' indicating an _ assumed _ constant inward flux of negative energy particles into the black hole due to the torque of the _ presumed _ nonnegligible accretion disk magnetic field at @xmath453 ; and @xmath454 is the conserved mass - energy flux , which in general is positive inside the ergosphere , i.e. , at least if it is to escape to infinity .",
    "now , the general expression for the efficiency of the release of gravitational binding energy due to accretion of a unit of rest mass @xmath455 is @xmath456 where @xmath81 is the conserved orbital energy parameter as measured by an observer at infinity , @xmath457 is the energy radiated to infinity , and @xmath458 is the total energy of the infalling mass .",
    "note , @xmath459 for a maximum rotating ( @xmath460 ) kbh at @xmath22 ( neglecting energy released due to viscosity ) .",
    "if @xmath461 is @xmath462 , this would imply that @xmath463 , indicating that rotational energy is extracted from the black hole .",
    "this would only occur if the total infall energy is negative or for @xmath464 , thus the reason why gammie set @xmath465 ( compare eq .  [ a1 ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , in gammie s ( 1999 ) proposed simplified so - called mhd penrose model , it was found that @xmath466 , particularly when we see below how he determined @xmath454 .",
    "but , the fact that rotational energy can be extracted due to the penrose mechanism had already been shown in details in williams ( 1991 , paper  1 ) theoretical : analytic and numerical calculations of realistic astrophysical penrose processes in the ergosphere of a kbh [ see  ",

    "rotational energy is extracted in the scattering event by a classical penrose process .",
    "it is found that @xmath472 acquires values up to @xmath473 , for escaping particle distributions , without the need to include the magnetic field of the accretion disk ( see paper  1 for details ) .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown by wagh , s. m. , dhurandhar , s. v. , & dadhich ( 1985 ) ; parthasarathy et al . ( 1986 ) that electromagnetic fields can increase the efficiency of fission and nonrelativistic penrose processes .    the expression that gammie ( 1999 ) uses to eliminate two degrees of freedom by expressing @xmath454 in terms of @xmath474 and by fixing @xmath475 , the angular velocity of a magnetic field line ( takahashi et al .",
    "1990 ) , can be derived using the initial conditions and the final results of my penrose analysis ( paper  1 ) .",
    "for example , gammie defines @xmath475 by the angular velocity of the orbiting fluid at constant @xmath42 ( i.e. , @xmath476 ) , where @xmath477 is the 4-velocity .",
    "he ( a ) assumes that @xmath478 , where @xmath479 defines the inertial frame dragging velocity at @xmath22 ; ( b ) assumes that the `` fluid , '' being torque by the magnetic field at @xmath22 , resulting in a radial inflow of negative energy flux , initially orbits at a constant radius ( @xmath476 ) , just as i initially assume that my target particles orbit at constant @xmath42 , with conserved energy @xmath81 and azimuthal angular momentum @xmath58 as measured by an observer at infinity , given analytically by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1972 ) and williams ( paper  1 , 2002b ) for equatorially and nonequatorially confined particle orbits , respectively .",
    "the final expression of the energy of particles escaping due to penrose scattering events [ see eqs .",
    "( 3.47 ) and ( 3.89 ) of paper  1 ] , can be adjusted to `` fit '' gammie s problem : that is , @xmath480 where the primes indicate final conditions .",
    "the transformation of the energy from the local nonrotating frame to the boyer - lindquist coordinate frame [ eq .  ( 2.8d ) of paper  1 ] , and the assumption that energy - momentum flux be continuous across the boundary between the inflow and the disk ( gammie 1999 ) ( i.e. , @xmath481 as measured by a local nonrotating frame observer ) have been used .",
    "let @xmath482 , @xmath483 , with @xmath484 , where @xmath455 is the particle s rest mass , then equation  ( [ eq : gammie ] ) becomes @xmath485 to express the above equation as the flux equation given by gammie ( 1999 , p.  l58 ) , we multiply both sides by per unit ( length)@xmath486 per unit time to obtain the desired equation : @xmath487 where the guiding center approximation has been used ( de felice & carlotto 1997 ; de felice & zonotti 2000 ; see also williams 2002b ) .",
    "notice that gammie ( 1999 , p. l58 ) merely states the above equation without saying anything about its derivation ( nor where it came from ) , except that `` one can show '' this to be true .",
    "he then uses this equation to solve a system of three equations : @xmath488 , @xmath489 , @xmath490 , using the conservation of energy , to be solved numerically for the three unknowns , @xmath474 and the fast critical points ( @xmath491 ) .",
    "he thus finds in some cases that @xmath492 and @xmath450 ; this is no surprise since it appears he used results derived from radially infalling particles , colliding with the orbiting target particles ( paper  1 ) , only altering them to express results for , instead , a radially directed magnetic field , assumed to torque the orbiting `` target '' particles , causing them to have negative , retrograde energy orbits , for which he represents as a negative `` rest mass flux '' [ @xmath493 ] normalized to be @xmath452 . to find that @xmath492 and @xmath494 , from my results ( paper  1 ) , as modified by gammie , simply means that negative particle energy is falling into the kbh , resulting in positive",
    "particle energy and angular momentum being extracted . however , from his results one can not tell if , or how , the magnetic field torques the particles , putting them on negative energy plunges . only a microphysical analysis , such as that done by williams ( paper  1 ) , for penrose scattering processes , will determine what effect the magnetic field has on the orbiting test particles . if gammie ( 1999 ) and krolik ( 1999 ) are proposing that the magnetic torque , acting on the orbiting particles , can serve the same purpose as infalling particle collisions with the orbiting target particles ( paper  1 ) , then the task concerning these blandford - znajek type models would be to show in details this to be true , i.e. , applying the microphysics involved , including the lorentz force on a particle in the local frame , to assess the effectiveness of magnetic - particle interactions .",
    "this has somewhat been addressed by li ( 2003 ) , as discussed in item 2 below .",
