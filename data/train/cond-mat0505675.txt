    "aluminum nitride ( aln ) belongs to the group iii - v family of semiconductors and possesses number of properties such as low thermal expansion ( close to that of silicon ) , high thermal conductivity , resistance to chemicals and gases normally used in semiconductor processing , and good dielectric properties , which make it potential candidate for technological applications in microelectronics .",
    "unlike another group iii - v semiconductor , boron nitride ( bn ) , aln does not exist in the layered graphitic form , which can be rolled up to form nanotubes .",
    "nevertheless , a few reports of aln nanotube and nanowire synthesis have appeared in literature in recent years@xcite . in the earliest report@xcite ,",
    "the aln nanotubes ( aln - nt ) and nanoparticles were synthesized by dc - arc plasma method and were characterized by the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) .",
    "the nanotubes were measured to be 500 - 700 nm in length with 30 - 200 nm diameter , and the nanoparticles had diameters in the 5 - 200 nm size range . the field emission pattern from tungsten tips coated with aln tubes was measured and was attributed to the tubes having open ends . using the same dc - arc plasma method , helical and twisted aln nanotubes",
    "were reported by the same group@xcite .",
    "the nanotubes were dispersed on graphite substrate and analyzed by scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "the tubes were reported to have an average diameter of 2.2 nm and lateral dimension of about 10 nm .",
    "the interatomic distance between two al - al or n - n atoms was measured to be 3.2  and from i - v curves the aln - nt were argued to be metallic in character@xcite . in another study@xcite ,",
    "same group reported synthesis of aln nanoparticles in the size range 15 - 18 nm and of nanowires of 500 - 700 nm in length with diameters in the 30 - 100 nm size range . in a subsequent report",
    ", these nanowires were interpreted to be nanotubes@xcite .",
    "synthesis of faceted hexagonal aln nanotubes has also been reported@xcite .",
    "these aln - nt were characterized by tem and are found to be of a few micrometers in length and 30 - 80 nm in diameter .",
    "most tubes were found with both ends open .",
    "there are also a few reports of theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "zhang and zhang@xcite considered two model al@xmath8n@xmath8 structures , one for an aln nanowire and one for an aln nanotube at the hartree - fock level using the 3 - 21 g basis set .",
    "they noted that aln bond length in finite aln - nts , modeled by the al@xmath8n@xmath8 tubule , alternates between 1.76  and 1.77  and posses large energy gap of 10.1 ev between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) level .",
    "this rather large gap of 10.1 ev is an artifact of the hartree - fock approximation which models exchange effects exactly but ignores correlations effects .",
    "our calculations , on the other hand , calculate the band gap by the so called @xmath6 where the first ionization potential is subtracted from the first electron affinity . in density functional theory for finite systems , this is known to provide better approximation to the band gap than the significantly underestimated homo - lumo eigenvalue difference .",
    "another theoretical calculation by zhao and coworkers@xcite have used density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to study strain energy ( energy required to curl up nanotube from graphite like planar sheet ) and stability of selected single - walled aln - nt .",
    "these calculations employed a localized numerical orbital basis and psuedopotential for description of ion cores .",
    "these authors noted homo - lumo gaps of 3.67 and 3.63 ev for ( 5,5 ) and ( 9,0 ) tubes , respectively .",
    "simulations at elevated temperatures at the level of lda indicated stability of single walled aln - nt at room temperature . in the present paper , we report the study of fullerene analogue of aln cages and finite @xmath9 single - walled aln nanotubes using analytic density functional theory .",
    "unlike aln - nt , only one study has so far addressed aln nitride cage structures .",
    "the study was performed using density functional theory and indicated possible existence of al@xmath10n@xmath10 , al@xmath0n@xmath0 , and al@xmath11n@xmath11 on the basis of energetics and vibrational stability@xcite .",
    "the present study is motivated partly by these works and partly by reports of synthesis of boron nitride ( bn ) cages@xcite . here ,",
    "we study several fullerene analogues of aln and selected single - wall aln nanotubes containing up to about 200 atoms .",
    "some of the cage structures studied in this work have been proposed as candidate structures for boron nitride ( bn ) cages synthesized and detected in mass spectrum@xcite .",
    "our study , performed at the all electron density functional level , does not preclude the existence of cage structures for the aln , in agreement with conclusion drawn by chang and coworkers@xcite .",
    "the binding energy , the first ionization potential , and electron affinity are calculated .",
    "the band gap calculated by difference of self - consistent solution ( @xmath12 ) method show that the cages and tubes of aln , like their bulk phase , are characterized by large gap .",
    "our calculations are performed using the slater - roothaan ( sr ) method@xcite .",
    "it uses gaussian bases to fit the orbitals and effective one body kohn - sham potential of density - functional theory@xcite . the sr method through robust and variational",
    "fitting is analytic and variational in all ( orbital and fitting ) basis sets@xcite .",
    "the most general functionals that it can treat so far are certain variants@xcite of the x@xmath13 functional@xcite . in particular , it can handle different @xmath13 s on different elements analytically and variationally so that the atomized energies of any cluster can be recovered exactly , and all energies are accurate through first order in any changes to any linear - combination - of - atomic - orbitals lcao or fit .",
    "s-_type fitting bases are those scaled from the _ s-_part of the orbital basis@xcite .",
    "a package of basis sets has been optimized@xcite for use with dgauss@xcite .",
    "we use the valence double-@xmath14 orbital basis set dzvp2 and the _ pd _ part of the ( 4,3;4,3 ) ( a2 ) charge density fitting basis .",
    "we use the @xmath13 values of 0.748222 and 0.767473 for al and n , respectively@xcite . using these @xmath13 values with the above basis sets , exact total energies of al and n atoms can be obtained .",
    "hence , in the present computational model , the atoms in the cages or tubes will have _ exact _ atomic energies in the dissociation limit@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this method using the exact atomic values of @xmath13 as judged from the binding energies of pople s g2 set of molecules lies between that of the local density approximation and that of the generalized gradient approximation@xcite .",
    "its main advantage is that it requires no numerical integration and hence within the accuracy of the model gives results that are accurate to machine precision .",
    "the optimization is performed using the broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( bfgs ) algorithm@xcite with forces on the atoms computed non - recursively using the 4-j generalized gaunt coefficients@xcite .",
    ".the bond length , dissociation energy of @xmath15 aln molecule obtained by present analytic slater - roothan method in comparison with those obtained from some selected computational models and experiment .",
    "the present value of dissociation energy does not contain zero point energy . [ cols=\"<,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the electronic structures of aln cages are given in table  [ tab : es ] while the binding energies per aln pair , the homo - lumo gaps , the ionization potential and the electron affinity of these cages are given in table [ table : be ] .",
    "the ionization potential ( electron affinity ) is calculated from the difference in the self - consistent solutions of neutral aln cage and its cation(anion ) .",
    "all structures are energetically stable with binding energies of order of 10 - 11 ev per aln pair .",
    "it is well known that the homo - lumo gaps obtained from the density functional models including the present one underestimate true band gap@xcite .",
    "the so called @xmath16 provides good approximation for the ionization potential and the electron affinity of the system@xcite .",
    "we determine the band gap as a difference of ionization potential and electron affinity computed by the @xmath16 method .",
    "the time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) or the _ gw _ approximation provide corrections to the homo - lumo gaps and are more suitable for calculations of the band gaps .",
    "we have not yet implemented these techniques .",
    "however , the present methodology of using fitting basis sets can also make tddft calculations efficient.@xcite the @xmath16 calculated gaps are given in table  [ table : be ] . in case of",
    "although the o cage is energetically less favorable its homo - lumo gap and @xmath16 gap are larger than those of the and cages . amongst the aln cages that have only six isolated squares",
    ", the binding energy systematically increases for al@xmath0n@xmath0 , @xmath17 al@xmath1n@xmath1 , and cages .",
    "this trend is similar to that observed in case of boron nitride cages@xcite and carbon fullerenes@xcite .",
    "the squares stick out too far in the m@xmath5n@xmath5 ( m@xmath18 ) cage for that cage to be favored and its hemisphere to be an extremely favorable cap of the ( 8,8 ) nanotubes .",
    "both the al@xmath5n@xmath5 cages have smaller binding energy than the al@xmath4n@xmath4 nanotube , perhaps due to larger number of defects ( octagonal and four - fold rings ) .",
    "the o al@xmath0n@xmath0 and al@xmath11n@xmath11 cages were also studied by change etal@xcite .",
    "they find that former has binding energy of 4.72ev / atom while the latter has binding energy of 4.76 ev / atom .",
    "the increase in the binding energy from octahedral al@xmath0n@xmath0 cage to al@xmath11n@xmath11 cage is 0.05 ev / atom .",
    "our calculations show binding energy gain of 0.4 ev / atom with size increase from octahedral al@xmath0n@xmath0 to octahedral al@xmath5n@xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore likely that the octahedral cages studied in this work are more stable than the icosahedral al@xmath11n@xmath11 cage . in comparison with their boron nitride counterparts@xcite",
    "the aln cages are energetically less stable , have lower ionization potentials and smaller band gaps .",
    "this feature is similar to the bulk phase of these materials .",
    "the band gap of solid aln is smaller than that of bn solids .    to summarize , fullerene - like cage structures and finite @xmath9 nanotubes are studied by the density functional calculations using polarized gaussian basis sets of double zeta quality .",
    "the binding energy , electron affinity , ionization potential , the homo - lumo gap and the @xmath6 gap are calculated for the optimized aln cages .",
    "calculations show that all aln cages are energetically stable , with band gap of order of 5 ev . for the larger cluster ,",
    "the _ two - shell _ cage with an interior cage is energetically favorable over the fullerene - like cage .",
    "the binding energies and band gaps are smaller than their bn counterparts .",
    "we hope that the present study will aid the experimental search for the aln cages .",
