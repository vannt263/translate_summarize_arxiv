    "in view of its history , fractional ( non - integer order ) calculus is as old as the classical calculus @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "there is just one definition of fractional integral operator , which is the riemann ",
    "liouville fractional integral .",
    "there are , however , several definitions of fractional differentiation , e.g. , caputo , riemann ",
    "liouville , hadamard , and wily differentiation @xcite .",
    "each type of fractional derivative has its own properties , which make richer the area of fractional calculus and enlarge its range of applicability @xcite .",
    "there are two recent research areas where fractional operators have a particularly important role : the fractional calculus of variations and the fractional theory of optimal control @xcite .",
    "a fractional variational problem is a dynamic optimization problem , in which the objective functional , as well as its constraints , depends on derivatives or integrals of fractional order , e.g. , caputo , riemann  liouville or hadamard fractional operators .",
    "this is a generalization of the classical theory , where derivatives and integrals can only appear in integer orders .",
    "if at least one non - integer ( fractional ) term exists in its formulation , then the problem is said to be a fractional variational problem or a fractional optimal control problem .",
    "the theory of the fractional calculus of variations was introduced by riewe in 1996 , to deal with nonconservative systems in mechanics @xcite .",
    "this subject has many applications in physics and engineering , and provides more accurate models of physical phenomena .",
    "for this reason , it is now under strong development : see @xcite and the references therein . for a survey ,",

    "there are two main approaches to solve problems of the fractional calculus of variations or optimal control .",
    "one involves solving fractional euler  lagrange equations or fractional pontryagin - type conditions , which is the indirect approach ; the other involves addressing directly the problem , without involving necessary optimality conditions , which is the direct approach .",
    "the emphasis in the literature has been put on indirect methods @xcite . for direct methods ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , almeida et al . developed direct numerical methods based on the idea of writing the fractional operators in power series , and then approximating the fractional problems with classical ones @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use a different approach to solve fractional variational problems and fractional optimal control problems , based on ritz s direct method .",
    "the idea is to restrict admissible functions to linear combinations of a set of known basis functions .",
