    "the reference interaction site model ( rism ) theory , formulated in the early 70 s by chandler and andersen  @xcite , is still one of the most adopted structural theories of molecular fluids . in the rism approach , developed as a generalization of the ornstein - zernike theory of atomic fluids  @xcite ,",
    "the molecules are represented as a collection of spherical interaction sites , rigidly connected so to reproduce a given molecular geometry  @xcite .",
    "originally the theory was developed to deal only with hard - sphere fluids  @xcite or with simple lennard - jones systems  @xcite .",
    "later on , the rism framework has been extended to take into account more realistic representations of complex fluids , including water , methanol and other compounds ( see refs  @xcite and a general review in ref .",
    "more recently , the rism approach ( along with its extensions and generalizations ) has been adopted for predicting structure , thermodynamic and phase equilibria of a large variety of systems , including dumbbell fluids  @xcite , colloids  @xcite , proteins  @xcite , surfactants  @xcite and water solutions  @xcite . in the last years",
    "further refinements of the original rism theory have made possible the development of more complex approaches , as for instance the three dimensional reference interaction site model theory  @xcite and the multi - center molecular ornstein - zernike equation  @xcite .",
    "the structure and the phase behavior of complex fluids is of great interest in the field of liquid and soft matter physics .",
    "this is expecially due to the peculiar thermodynamic and structural properties exhibited by some of these fluids , named anomalous liquids .",
    "water is the most known example of such fluids ; its peculiar behaviors , including re - entrant melting and density anomalies , have been largely investigated both from experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite points of view .",
    "the existence of these anomalies has been traditionally related to the possibility to develop a network between water molecules through hydrogen bonds .    within this framework",
    "a modeling approach , which is arousing an increasing interest in the last years , is based on spherically symmetric core - softened ( cs ) potentials : according to this approach , formulated by hemmer and stell in 1970  @xcite , in these potentials the hard - core interactions turn to be softened and an attractive tail is set .",
    "a large variety of studies has been carried out to investigate the peculiar physical properties of these potentials , with a particular focus on liquid - liquid phase transition  @xcite and water - like anomalies  @xcite . in this context , the rism theory has been successfully adopted , along with the mode - coupling theory , to study the pressure dependence of the diffusion coefficient for acetonitrile and methanol in water  @xcite and to analyze the phase behavior of a number of cs molecular models  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate structure and thermodynamics of a simple model for a dimeric fluid interacting via a modified inverse - power potential ( mip )  @xcite by means of rism theory and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . in a previous study  @xcite",
    "we have shown that a system of dimeric particles interacting through mip diplays typical water - like anomalies , like a temperature of maximum density ( tmd ) and a non - monotonic behavior of the pair translational entropy .",
    "also , we have investigated how the existence of such anomalies depends on the elongation of the dimers and on the interaction potential parameters .",
    "in particular , upon increasing the repulsion softening , it has been possible to study how the fluid structure is changed when going from one - scale behavior typical of lennard - jones fluids to a two - scale behavior characterizing the cs systems .    here",
    "we extensively employ the rism framework for calculating structural and thermodynamic properties of the dimer fluid interacting via mip , in the whole range of elongations and for two different values of the repulsion softening .",
    "for this purpose we adopt and compare hypernetted chain ( hnc )  @xcite and kovalenko - hirata ( kh )  @xcite approximation closures and various routes from the structure to thermodynamics .",
    "where possible , theoretical results are assessed against previous  @xcite or newly generated mc simulations performed in the canonical ensemble . this work has been carried out with the aim to investigate the anomalous behaviors of the dimer fluid in a wide range of parameters ; also , to the best of our knowledge , this study constitutes the first application of the rism approach to investigate density and structural anomalies in a molecular fluid interacting via a cs potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we provide details of the model , the rism theory and the simulation approach .",
    "results are presented and discussed in the third section and conclusions follow in the last section .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     kh predictions for the tmd in the whole range of @xmath0 values",
    "are collectively reported in fig  [ fig : tmd ] : for @xmath3 ( a ) we observe a progressive shift of the density anomaly regions towards very low temperatures , with a `` saturation '' for @xmath4 .",
    "at the same time , pressure attains progressively lower values .",
    "a similar scenario holds for @xmath5 ( b ) , but in this case the saturation effect is not observed and the density anomaly region moves towards lower and lower values of @xmath6 . in comparison with simulations ,",
    "the theory predicts the existence of the tmd for all values of @xmath7 for both @xmath3 and @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", simulations predict the existence of the tmd only if @xmath8 for @xmath3 and @xmath9 for @xmath5 . at higher values of @xmath0",
    "the development of the density anomaly is likely prevented by the onset of solid phases .",
    "however , according to kh predictions , the system persists in a fluid phase down to very low temperatures and hence the development of the tmd is not hampered by a crystallization .",
    "this observation can be checked by looking at the behavior of the molecular structure factor @xmath10 that , for a biatomic molecule , is equivalent to the structure factor between the centers of mass of two dimers . according to the qualitative criterion developed by hansen and verlet for the lennard - jones potential  @xcite ,",
    "a fluid system approaches a solid phase when the height of the first peak of the @xmath10 exceed 2.85 .",
    "a similar criterion is expected to roughly hold even if a cs potential is adopted . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sk ] we compare mc and kh @xmath10 obtained for @xmath11 , @xmath5 and @xmath12 : simulation data show a progressive increase of the first peak of the @xmath10 until it overcomes 3 for densities between 0.40 and 0.60 and the system becomes solid - like . for",
    "density higher than 0.60 , the first peak decreases and the system becomes fluid again . according to the kh predictions ,",
    "the increase of the peak is equally observed but it never becomes greater than 3 .",
    "rather , it approaches a maximum at 2.5 and then decreases .     from mc simulations ( circles ) and",
    "kh ( squares ) for @xmath11 , @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "dashed lines are guides for the eye.,width=302 ]    finally , we have calculated the residual multiparticle entropy @xmath14 defined as : @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the excess free energy per particle and @xmath18 is the excess entropy per particle . according to the criterion developed by giaquinta and giunta",
    "@xcite @xmath14 vanishes whenever a fluid system approaches the solidification .",
    "it has been shown that the validity of this criterion holds for softly repulsive fluids also  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltas ] we report the residual multiparticle entropy obtained from mc and kh for @xmath11 , @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "simulation data indicate that @xmath14 crosses the zero line for @xmath19 , whereas kh theory never predicts that @xmath14 vanishes .",
    "such a result agrees with the behavior of @xmath10 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : sk ] .",
    "the emerging picture confirms that kh , while providing for the reentrant effect typical of anomalous fluids , underestimates the onset of the solid phase . summarizing , according to results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : sk ] and  [ fig : deltas ] for @xmath11 , @xmath5 and @xmath13 , the system freezes for @xmath19 : on the other hand , the theoretical underestimation of the onset of the solid phase causes the density anomaly is still observed in the kh context .",
    "we have investigated density and structural anomalies in a dimeric fluid interacting via a purely repulsive core - softened potential by means of integral equation theories . starting with a simple monomeric case",
    "we have progressively increased the elongation @xmath0 till to obtain a tangent configuration .",
    "we have also considered two different conditions , corresponding to one ( @xmath3 ) and two ( @xmath5 ) length scales of the intermolecular potential .",
    "theoretical results have been systematically compared with already existing or newly generated monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "we have found that in the monomeric case the ornstein - zernike equation , coupled with hypernetted chain and kovalenko - hirata ( kh ) closures is able to accurately reproduce simulation data for internal energy and pressure if the virial equation of state is adopted .",
    "nevertheless , the loci of density anomalies are underestimated by both the closures . upon increasing @xmath0",
    "we have implemented the reference interaction site model ( rism ) theory coupled with kh closure ; also , we have adopted a closed form for the calculation of pressure , available in the context of this closure .",
    "the theory is still able to reproduce simulation results for pressure , being less predictive for the internal energy .",
    "the fluid structure has been investigated by computing the site - site radial distribution function @xmath20 : mc and kh agree in providing a double - peak structure for @xmath5 , such a feature being strongly reminiscent of the double length scales of the interaction potential .",
    "this is not the case of @xmath3 , where only a single peak in @xmath20 is observed .",
    "structural and density anomalies are found for both @xmath3 and @xmath5 : the theory qualitatively agrees with simulations in predicting their existence , but systematically underestimates the temperatures where they occur . in comparison with simulations , where the density anomaly is observed for @xmath8 if @xmath3 and for @xmath9 if @xmath5 , kh predicts the existence of this anomaly in the whole range of elongations .",
    "this is due to the underestimation of the solid phase , that in simulations prevents the development of this anomaly for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "overall , the theory proves to be reliable in providing the existence of structural and thermodynamic anomalies even if a quantitative prediction is not achieved .",
    "we emphasize that this is the first application of the rism approach to investigate these anomalies in a fluid interacting through a core - softened potential .",
    "the possibility to have a reliable theoretical tool able to provide a quick estimate of these anomalies , whereas simulations can become more time demanding , set integral equations as promising candidates in describing fluid structure and phase behaviors of many complex fluids , such as elongated molecules , polymers and colloidal dimers ."
