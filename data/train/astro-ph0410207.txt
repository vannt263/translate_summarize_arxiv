    "the evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) is the technique to model the spectrophotometric properties of stellar populations , that uses the knowledge of stellar evolution .",
    "this approach was pioneered by b.  tinsley in a series of fundamental papers , that provide the basic concepts still used in present - day computations .",
    "the models are used to determine ages , element abundances , stellar masses , stellar mass functions , etc .",
    ", of those stellar populations that are not resolvable in single stars , like galaxies and extra - galactic globular clusters . due to the ubiquitous astrophysical applications of eps models ,",
    "a rich literature has been developed so far ( bruzual  1983 ; renzini & buzzoni  1986 ; chiosi , bertelli and bressan  1988 ; buzzoni  1989 ; charlot & bruzual  1991 ; bruzual & charlot  1993 ; worthey  1994 ; vazdekis et al .  1996 ; tantalo et al .",
    "1996 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange  1997 ; bressan , granato & silva  1998 ; maraston  1998 ; leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ; brocato et al .",
    "2000 ; thomas , maraston & bender  2003 ; thomas , maraston & korn  2004 ) .    in the simplest flavour of an eps model , called _ simple stellar population _",
    "( hereafter ssp ) by renzini  ( 1981 ) , it is assumed that all stars are coeval and share the same chemical composition .",
    "the advantage of dealing with ssps is twofold .",
    "first , ssps can be compared directly with globular cluster ( gc ) data , since these are the `` simplest '' stellar populations in nature .",
    "this offers the advantage of _ calibrating _ the ssps with those gcs for which ages and element abundances are independently known , an approach introduced in the review by renzini & fusi pecci ( 1988 ) .",
    "this step is crucial to fix the parameters that are used to describe that part of the model `` input physics '' - convection , mass loss , mixing - that can not be derived from first principles .",
    "the calibrated models can be applied with more confidence to the study of extragalactic stellar populations .",
    "this step is taken in the models of maraston  ( 1998 ) and in their extension presented here .",
    "second , complex stellar systems which are made up by various stellar generations are modelled by convolving ssps with the adopted star formation history ( e.g. tinsley  1972 ; arimoto & yoshii 1986 ; rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1987 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 ; kodama & arimoto  1997 ; barbaro & poggianti 1997 ; bruzual & charlot  2003 ) .",
    "therefore the deep knowledge of the building blocks of complex models is very important .",
    "two techniques are adopted to compute ssp models , which differ according to the integration variable adopted in the post - main sequence : isochrone synthesis and ` fuel consumption based ' algorithms . with the ` isochrone synthesis ' ( e.g. chiosi , bertelli & bressan  1988 ;",
    "charlot & bruzual  1991 ) the properties of a stellar population are calculated by integrating the contributions to the flux in the various passbands of all mass - bins along one isochrone , after assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) . usually isochrones are computed up to the end of the early asymptotic giant branch phase .",
    "later stellar phases like the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch are added following individual recipes or are neglected .    in the ` fuel consumption",
    "' approach ( renzini 1981 ; renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; buzzoni  1989 ; maraston  1998 ) , the integration variable in post main sequence is the so - called _ fuel _ , that is the amount of hydrogen and/or helium that is consumed via nuclear burning during a given post main sequence phase .",
    "the fuel at a given age is computed on the stellar evolutionary track of the _ turnoff _ mass ( i.e. , the mass completing the hydrogen - burning phase ) , thereby neglecting the dispersion of stellar masses in post main sequence .",
    "however since a mass difference of only few percent exists between the _ turnoff _ mass and the mass at any other post - main sequence phase , this assumption can be made safely , as also shown by charlot & bruzual  ( 1991 ) .",
    "the advantages of the fuel consumption approach are of two kinds .",
    "first , the fuel as integration variable is very stable since it is directly proportional to the contributions of the various phases to the total luminosity .",
    "this is very important in luminous , but short - lived evolutionary stages , e.g. the bright red giant branch phase , where the evolutionary mass practically does not change .",
    "we note that the problem of the numerical instability on the rgb was early recognized by tinsley &  gunn ( 1976 ) .",
    "second , and more important , there are several relevant stellar phases ( e.g. blue horizontal branch , thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch , very hot old stars etc . )",
    "whose theoretical modeling is uncertain because of mass loss and for which complete stellar tracks are not available .",
    "the fuel consumption provides useful analytical relations that link the main sequence to the post main sequence evolution , by means of which one can include into the synthesis the energy contributions of these uncertain phases using , e.g. observations .",
    "the ` isochrone synthesis ' technique is used in all models in the literature , with the exception of the models by buzzoni  ( 1989 ) , maraston  ( 1998 ) and those presented here , that adopt the fuel consumption theorem .    besides the method used to compute them , evolutionary population synthesis models keep the uncertainties inherent in the stellar evolutionary tracks and in the spectral transformations .",
    "charlot , worthey & bressan  ( 1996 ) investigated both classes of uncertainties by comparing their eps models .",
    "the analysis is very illustrative for the three considered eps , however does not yield information about the sole impact of the stellar tracks .",
    "here we make a different exercise , because we can use the same eps code and just vary the model ingredients . in this way we can isolate their impact on the final model .",
    "to quantify the model uncertainties is indeed very important since the cosmological inferences that are derived on the basis of galaxy ages and metallicities rely ultimately on the stellar population models .",
    "maraston ( 1998 ) presents a fuel - consumption - based code for evolutionary population synthesis , and ssp models for solar metallicity , and ages from 30 myr to 15 gyr .",
    "distinct features of that work are :    1 .   the extension of the fuel consumption theorem to compute models for young and intermediate - range ages ; 2 .",
    "the inclusion of a well - calibrated semi - empirical thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase , and the computation of realistic colors of intermediate - age ( @xmath13 ) stellar populations 3 .",
    "the modular structure of the code , that allows experiments with the eps ingredients .",
    "subsequentely the code has been updated to the computations of ssp models covering a wide range in metallicities and the model output have been extended to e.g. the spectral energy distributions , spectral indices , redshift evolution , with several applications being already published ( maraston & thomas 2000 ; saglia et al .",
    "2000 ; maraston et al .",
    "2001 ; maraston et al .  2003 ; thomas , maraston & bender  2003 ; thomas , maraston & korn 2004 ; ferraro et al .",
    "this work is devoted to discuss comprehensively the overall eps models and ingredients , in particular , the inclusion of the tp - agb phase in the synthetic spectral energy distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 the properties of the evolutionary population synthesis code",
    "are recalled .",
    "the model ingredients , i.e. the fuel consumptions , the temperature distributions and the model atmospheres , for the various metallicities and ages , are described in detail in section  3 . in particular , the recipes for horizontal branch and thermally pulsing aymptotic giant branch are presented in section 3.4 .",
    "the various model output are discussed in section  4 , where the comparisons with observational data and with models from the literatures are also presented .",
    "section  5 deals with the model uncertainties , while section  6 presents an high - redshift application of the model seds in which the tp - agb has a primary importance .",
    "finally a summary of the main results is given in section  7 .",
    "in this section we recall the basic equations that define the algorithm of the eps code by maraston ( 1998 , hereafter m98 ) .",
    "following renzini & buzzoni  ( 1986 , hereafter rb86 ) , the total bolometric luminosity of a ssp of age @xmath14 and chemical composition @xmath15 $ ] , is splitted conveniently into the contributions by main sequence ( ms ) and post main sequence ( pms ) @xmath16 ) = l_{\\rm ms}^{\\rm bol}(t ; [ y , z ] ) + l_{\\rm pms}^{\\rm bol}(t ; [ y , z]).\\ ] ] [ lt ] because the two quantities depend on different ingredients .",
    "the ms light is produced by stars spanning a very wide mass range , while the pms one is produced by stars of virtually the same mass .",
    "therefore @xmath17 depends on the adopted mass - luminosity relation @xmath18 and imf , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 being the scale factor related to the size of the stellar population ) , while @xmath21 depends on the nuclear fuel burned in the various evolved stellar stages .",
    "the ms luminosities are computed by integrating the contributions by each mass bins along a isochrone , from a lower mass limit @xmath22 ( usually @xmath23 ) to the current turnoff mass @xmath24(t ) , having assumed an imf @xmath25 @xmath26)=\\int_{\\rm m_{inf}}^{\\rm m_{to}}l({\\rm m}(t ; [ y , z]))\\psi({\\rm m})dm \\label{lms}\\ ] ] the pms luminosity contributions are computed by means of the _ fuel consumption theorem _ ( rb86 ) @xmath27)=9.75\\cdot 10^{10}\\cdot b(t)\\cdot \\sum_{\\rm j } { \\rm fuel}_{\\rm j}(m_{\\rm to}(t ; [ y , z ] ) ) \\label{lpms}\\ ] ] where the _ evolutionary flux _ @xmath28)$ ] , @xmath29)=\\psi(m_{\\rm to}(t ; [ y , z]))|{\\dot{m}}_{\\rm to}| \\label{biditi}\\ ] ] provides",
    "the rate of stars evolving to any pms phase @xmath30 at the age @xmath14 of the stellar population , and @xmath31 is the amount of stellar mass to be converted in luminosity in each of these phases .",
    "the multiplicative factor in eq .",
    "[ lpms ] stems from expressing the luminosity in solar units , the evolutionary flux @xmath32 in years and the fuel in solar masses through the einstein equation @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "the latter is derived by considering that the transformation of 1 g of h into he releases @xmath35 erg .",
    "this average value takes into account the dependence on whether the cno cycle or the pp chain is at work and the different neutrino losses as a function of the temperature of the burning ( renzini 1981 ) .",
    "following m98 , the ingredients of evolutionary synthesis models are :    1 .   _ the energetics _ : mass - luminosity relations for the ms and fuel consumptions for pms phases ; 2 .   _ the surface parameters _ : the effective temperatures and surface gravities of the evolutionary phases ; 3 .   _ the transformations to observables _ : spectra , or colours and bolometric corrections as functions of gravity and temperature , to convert the bolometric luminosity into a spectral energy distribution .",
    "the key feature of the code is to have the three ingredients being allocated in three _ independent _ sets of matrices .",
    "this is very convenient as the code can be used to understand the impact of the various input _ selectively _ on the final result .",
    "we will use this structure to understand the discrepancies between eps models that are based on different stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "the adopted ingredients are described in the next subsections .",
    "the first matrix contains the energetics , i.e. the luminosities of ms stars and the fuel consumptions of pms phases . in general , both are taken from stellar evolutionary models , except for those stellar phases that are poorly understood ( section  [ recipes ] ) , for which the energetics are estimated semi - empirically , by means of observations and with the aid of the fuel consumption theorem .",
    "the bulk of input stellar models ( tracks and isochrones ) is from cassisi et al .",
    "( 1997a , b ; 2000 ; see also bono et al .",
    "their main features are summarized in the following .",
    "these are _ canonical _ stellar evolutionary tracks , i.e. the efficiency of the overshooting parameter is assumed to be zero .",
    "the actual size of the overshooting is a matter of debate since several years and work is in progress to calibrate the overshooting parameter with observational data ( bertelli et al .",
    "2003 ; woo et al .",
    "these articles favour moderate amounts of overshooting , but the results on different stellar evolutionary tracks are discrepant .",
    "the cassisi tracks are used to compute what we will refer to as _ standard _ ssp models .",
    "the choice of these tracks as basis is due to the following reasons : i ) extensive calibrations with galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) have been performed ( cassisi & salaris 1997 ; cassisi , deglinnocenti , salaris 1997 ; de santi & cassisi 1999 ) ; ii ) tracks ( isochrones ) are provided with very fine time ( mass ) spacing ( e.g. , a typical red giant branch track contains @xmath36 models ) which is essential to perform good numerical integrations ; iii ) these tracks are the closest to the ones ( from castellani , chieffi & straniero  1992 ) that were adopted for the solar metallicity models presented in m98 .",
    "for sake of homogeinity , the m98 models have been re - computed with the solar metallicity tracks of the cassisi s database .",
    "minimal differences have been found , that are due to the temperature / colour transformations rather than to the stellar tracks .",
    "the metallicity of the cassisi tracks range from @xmath37 , typical of the milky way halo to @xmath38 , the helium enrichment law being @xmath39 . in order to extend the metallicity range ,",
    "we implement a set of tracks with 3.5 solar metallicity , and the same @xmath40 , from the padova database ( see below ) . the exact values of helium and metals for the ssp grid are tabulated in the section presenting the results .",
    "most ssp models in the literature are based on the tracks by the padova group ( fagotto et al .",
    "1994 ; girardi et al .",
    "2000 ; salasnich et al .",
    "therefore it is interesting to explore the effects of other stellar evolutionary tracks , on the ages and metallicities inferred for real stellar populations . to this aim several ssps",
    "have been computed by means of the padova stellar models .",
    "the various comparisons will be shown in section  [ uncertainties ] .",
    "the issue is a very important one as at metallicities above solar , i.e. in the range more relevant to massive galaxies , the calibration of the tracks is hampered by the lack of gcs with ages and chemical compositions known independently .    finally the solar metallicity isochrones / tracks of the geneva database ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 ; meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) are adopted in order to compute very young ssps ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "isochrones are adopted up to the turnoff , and the ms luminosity contributions are evaluated by means of equation  [ lms ] .",
    "therefore the results depend on the mass - luminosity relations of the isochrones .",
    "figure  [ mlrel ] compares the mass - luminosity relations of the isochrones from cassisi and padova ( solid and dotted lines , respectively ) for various ages and metallicities . in general",
    ", a fairly good agreement is found for masses @xmath42 , independent of the metallicity , while the low ms of the padova tracks with high metallicity ( solar and above ) is brighter than that of the cassisi tracks , by nearly a factor 2 .",
    "however this effect is not important , because the contribution of the low ms to the total light is very small , unless the stellar population has a very steep imf ( e.g. @xmath43 in the notation in which the salpeter exponent is 2.35 , m98 ) , so that its light is dwarf dominated .",
    "noticeable is instead the effect of overshooting , because of which the padova ms has a turnoff mass at given age that is _ larger _ than that of canonical tracks ( e.g. at 3 gyr and solar metallicity the turnoff masses are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ) .",
    "stellar models with overshooting have more massive convective cores , therefore they run to higher luminosities and live longer than classical models .",
    "this effect stems from the higher fuel for given mass when overshooting is considered , which prolongues the ms lifetime .",
    "the effect lasts until the mass has a convective core on the ms , i.e. it disappears for @xmath46 .    as to metallicity effects ,",
    "at given mass a higher metal content makes the star fainter , because of the combined effects of the less amount of hydrogen and the higher opacity .",
    "for example , a @xmath47 star with   @xmath48 metallicity is a factor 3 fainter on the ms than one with the same mass but metallicity  @xmath37 .",
    "instead , there is no difference between the solar and twice - solar metallicity ms relations .",
    "this comes from the fact that helium increases along with metallicity in both tracks , according to the helium enrichment law @xmath49 . the higher helium at larger metallicity counterbalances the metallicity effects and keeps the star at roughly the same brightness .",
    "in order to link the pms evolution of the turnoff mass to its ms , one needs to know the rate of evolution of turnoff - like stars off the ms through the later evolutionary stages , as a function of the ssp parameters ( age , metallicity , imf ) . according to rb86 this quantity",
    "is expressed analytically by the evolutionary flux @xmath32 ( eq .  [ biditi ] ) , that is proportional to the time derivative of the relation turnoff mass / age and the adopted imf .",
    "the dependence of the function @xmath32 on the ssp parameters is shown in figure  [ bflux ] .",
    "the main panel focuses on age and chemical composition effects , the small one on the imf .",
    "obviously @xmath32 depends mainly on the age of the ssp , as the derivative of the turnoff mass does , while metallicity effects have a much milder influence .",
    "the effect of the imf on @xmath32 was discussed in m98 . in brief , the flatter the imf , the slower @xmath50 increases with time , so that the rapid decrease in m@xmath51 dominates for flat imfs .",
    "this results in a steeper ssp luminosity evolution for flatter imfs . in the small box in figure  [ bflux ]",
    "we show @xmath32 for a kroupa  ( 2001 ) imf , that will be used as alternative choice to the salpeter one to compute ssp models .",
    "the kroupa  ( 2001 ) imf is described as a multiple - part power law , with exponents : 1.3 for @xmath52 , 2.3 for larger masses ( in the notation in which the salpeter exponent is 2.35 ) .",
    "the kroupa imf has a relatively higher fraction of massive stars , which explains why the correspondent @xmath32 is steeper than that referred to the salpeter imf ( note that the @xmath32 s are normalized to @xmath53 of total mass of the parent ssp and it is the normalization factor that produces the difference ) .",
    "the luminosity contributions of the pms phases are computed by means of the fuel consumption theorem , according to eq .",
    "the nomenclature of the main pms evolutionary phases , in order after the ms , are : sub giant branch ( sgb ) ; red giant branch ( rgb ) ; helium burning or horizontal branch ( hb ) ; early asymptotic giant branch ( e - agb ) ; thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) .",
    "the stellar evolutionary phases are highlighted on the observed colour magnitude diagram of ngc  1851 , a metal - poor gc of the milky way ( data from piotto et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in order to compute the fuels ,",
    "evolutionary tracks are adopted up to the completion of the e - agb .",
    "complete tracks for the tp - agb phase are not available .",
    "in fact it is difficult to follow the physics of the stellar interiors during the thermal pulses and stellar tracks are actually restricted to envelope models ( e.g. renzini & voli  1981 ; iben & renzini  1983 ; lattanzio  1986 ; boothroyd & sackmann  1988 ; bloecker & schoenberner  1991 ; marigo , bressan & chiosi  1996 ; wagenhuber & gronewegen  1998 ; marigo 2001 ; mouhcine & lanon  2002 ) , and even the latter are uncertain due to the occurrence of strong mass - loss that aborts the phase ( the _ superwind _ phase , iben & renzini  1983 ) . in the present models the energetics of",
    "the tp - agb comes from the semi - empirical calibration of m98 ( see section  [ tp - agb ] ) .    the fuel for the evolutionary phase @xmath30 ( until the e - agb ) is computed by integrating the product of the evolutionary time and the emergent luminosity along the track appropriate to that phase .",
    "the tracks for the given turnoff masses are obtained from interpolation in log mass .",
    "the evolutionary mass for the helium burning phase @xmath54 is obtained from @xmath24 after evaluation of the mass loss during the rgb .",
    "this allows to play with various hb morphologies ( see section  [ recipes ] ) .",
    "finally , the separation between hb and e - agb is set when the mass of the co core along the track is different from zero .",
    "note that each phase is divided suitably into a certain number of subphases , in order to map appropriately the spectral type changes ( m98 ) .",
    "the criterion for the subdivision into suphases depends on the temperature , therefore is described in section  [ temperatures ] .",
    "figure  [ fuelfasi ] shows the fuels ( in @xmath55 ) for the pms evolutionary phases , as functions of the turnoff mass , for various metallicities . as already pointed out by rb86 , the most relevant pms phase changes with the evolutionary mass , i.e. with the age of the stellar population , and we find here that the trend does not depend on the chemical composition . in massive stars ( @xmath56 ) , i.e. those dominating _",
    "- @xmath57 - stellar populations , the dominant pms phase is the hb , its fuel decreases with the decreasing stellar mass . in low - mass stars ( @xmath58 ) , i.e. those dominating _ old",
    "_ - @xmath59 - stellar populations , the rgb phase is the most important pms phase , when a he - degenerate core is developed ( rb86 ; sweigart , greggio & renzini  1989 ) . stars with masses in the narrow mass range between 3 and 2  @xmath60 , i.e. those dominating @xmath61 old stellar populations , spend a conspicuos amount of fuel on the tp - agb phase . the onset of the development of the tp - agb and rgb phases has been called by rb86 `` phase transitions '' .",
    "the hb fuel ( left - hand upper panel ) of massive stars is affected by metallicity in the sense of a higher fuel at a lower metal content , owing to the higher relative abundance of hydrogen , an effect similar to what pointed out for the ms luminosity ( section  [ ms ] ) .",
    "for example , at masses @xmath62 , the @xmath63 metallicity has nearly a factor 2 more fuel than the solar one . in the small mass regime ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 )",
    "metallicity effects are negligible .    the rgb phase ( right - hand upper panel ) starts to develop at masses around @xmath66 almost independent of metallicity in these classical ( no overshooting ) tracks , in excellent agreement with the early findings by sweigart , greggio & renzini  ( 1990 ) .",
    "the rgb fuel is rather insensitive to metallicity until @xmath67 . for reference , a 10 gyr ,",
    "@xmath68 stellar population has @xmath69 of rgb fuel and a coeval one with solar metallicity @xmath70 .",
    "however , at higher metallicities the rgb fuel starts decreasing with increasing metal content , and for example a stellar population with @xmath71 ( see figure  [ ftotage ] ) has @xmath72 of rgb fuel , nearly 35  per cent less than the solar chemical composition .",
    "this is the effect of the very high helium abundance associated to the high metal content because of the helium enrichment law @xmath49 , that reduces drastically the amount of hydrogen , i.e. the rgb source of fuel .",
    "a discussion on the effect of helium abundance on the fuel of pms phases is found in greggio & renzini  ( 1990 ) .",
    "the tp - agb fuel ( middle upper panel ) is one of the most conspicuous , together with that in hb and rgb , and is a strong function of the stellar mass , therefore of the age of the stellar population .",
    "it reaches a maximum for masses between 3 and 2 @xmath60 and is negligible for masses outside this narrow intermediate - mass range .",
    "furthermore , the tp - agb fuel does not depend appreciably on metallicity ( see section  [ tp - agb ] ) .",
    "finally the sgb and e - agb ( lower panels ) are the least important phases , providing at most @xmath73 per cent and @xmath74 per cent , respectively of the total pms luminosity ( see also section  [ resbolometric ] ) .",
    "figure  [ ftotage ] shows the total fuel consumption in the whole pms , as a function of age , for the various metallicities . in interpreting this figure in a stellar population perspective",
    "it is useful to remind that the fuel scales directly with the pms luminosity of a stellar population .    the effect of the chemical composition that we discussed previously is evident on the total fuel of stellar populations with ages smaller than @xmath75 , that is larger the lower the metal content is .",
    "a young metal - poor stellar population with @xmath76 has @xmath77 20 per cent more fuel to be burned , e.g. is 20 per cent brighter than a coeval one in which the metallicity is twice solar . in older stellar populations metallicity effects become less important , as a consequence of the small metallicity dependence of the rgb fuel , that is the largest source of energy at high ages .",
    "an exception is however the very metal - rich stellar population ( @xmath78 , dashed - dotted line ) , that at old ages has @xmath79 per cent less fuel than all other chemical compositions , for which the fuel scatter around a value @xmath80 .",
    "this is due to the very high abundance of helium in these tracks , caused by the assumed helium enrichment law ( @xmath39 ) , that implies the abundance of hydrogen to be only @xmath81 .",
    "this explains the sharp decrease in fuel since hydrogen is its most important source .",
    "the sizable increase of pms fuel at ages around 0.3 gyr ( @xmath82 ) marks the onset of the agb phase transition , that is dominated by the tp - agb ( m98 , figure  [ fuelfasi ] ) . at later ages",
    "the rgb phase transition occurs , which is barely visible in figure  [ ftotage ] as a small bump around 1 gyr , due to the simulatenous decrease of tp - agb fuel .",
    "finally , the bumps in the fuels at late ages ( @xmath83 ) reflect the trend of the sgb fuel ( figure  [ fuelfasi ] ) .    after the development of the tp - agb , @xmath84 per cent of the total energy of a stellar population comes from pms stars ( figure  6 ) .",
    "the dependence of ms and pms energetics on stellar evolutionary tracks is illustrated in figure  7 .",
    "the transition from a not degenerate to a degenerate helium core , that marks a well developed rgb phase and a drop in the hb fuel , occurs at later epochs if overshooting is taken into account in the stellar models .",
    "this is shown in the top panels of figure  [ fuelpadfra ] , where the fuels obtained with classical ( solid ) and overshooting ( dotted ) tracks as functions of the age of the stellar populations are compared .",
    "the rgb phase transition occurs at @xmath85 in classical models and at @xmath86 in models with overshooting .",
    "the age marking the onset of the rgb phase transition was early recommended by barbaro & pigatto ( 1984 ) as a suitable observational check of the overshooting hypothesis .",
    "this test has been recently performed by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , where deep , vlt - based , @xmath87 cmds of lmc gcs allow the quantification of the population ratios between rgb and he - clump , as functions of the gc age .",
    "the comparison with the theoretical predictions of classical and overshooted tracks ( the same tracks shown in figure  [ fuelpadfra ] ) clearly exclude the latter , in that they predict a substantially later development of the rgb ( see figures  8,9 in ferraro et al .",
    "this result supports our use of classical evolutionary tracks for our standard ssp models .",
    "figure  7 ( bottom left - hand panel ) also shows that the ms luminosity of the tracks with overshooting is larger than that of the classical one , while the trend is reversed for the pms ( bottom right - hand panel ) , for the reasons already explained .",
    "note that the evolutionary fluxes are very similar ( central right - hand panel ) , which is mostly due to the similarity of the time derivative of the turnoff masses .",
    "finally , the sgb phase appears also to be a little delayed ( central left - hand panel ) , but its impact on the results is very small .    because of the earlier rgb phase transition , at @xmath88 the ssps based on the cassisi s tracks are nearly 40 per cent more luminous than those based on the padova tracks .",
    "an output that is affected by these variations is obviously the @xmath89 ratio , a key quantity used to determine the stellar mass of galaxies ( see section  [ ml ] ) .",
    "the second matrix contains the distribution of effective temperatures and surface gravities of the evolutionary phases @xmath90 for the various ages and metallicities . as already mentioned , every evolutionary phase is split into a certain number of so - called _ photometric sub - phases _ , inside which the spread in effective temperatures @xmath91 is @xmath92 .",
    "this was found to be appropriate for a good tracing of the varying spectral type along a phase . ] .",
    "what is revelant to evolutionary synthesis models is that the fuel consumption is evaluated specifically in each subphase . in general the consumption of energy",
    "is not homogeneous with temperature .",
    "this is visualized in figure  [ tesub_fuel ] , where the temperature / gravity subphases for old ( 12 gyr ) rgbs and hbs are displayed for two metallicities ( circles for solar ; triangles for @xmath93}=-2.25 $ ] ) , with the symbol size being proportional to the fuel .",
    "the fuel consumption along the rgb of a metal - rich stellar population is enhanced at the so - called rgb _ bump _",
    "( big circles in the left - hand panel of figure  [ tesub_fuel ] ) , when the h - burning shell reaches the internal layer that was previously mixed through the first convective dredge - up , gets fresh fuel and therefore spends a longer time in this location ( sweigart , greggio & renzini  1989 ) .",
    "the rgb _ bump _ is rather close to the he clump .",
    "if the total rgb fuel would be assigned homogeneously along the rgb track , the weight of the _ bump _ would be unappropriately distributed along the whole track , in particular would be given to the tip , with the effect of overestimating the near - ir flux of the ssp . the fuel consumption approach implemented here where the evolutionary timescale is considered is an efficient way of taking the bump into account .",
    "the bump is predicted to almost disappear at decreasing metallcity ( sweigart , greggio , renzini  1989 ) , and indeed the rgb fuel in the metal - poor stellar population results to be rather homogeneously distributed ( triangles in figure  [ tesub_fuel ] ) .",
    "note that the significant contribution of the rgb tip to the fuel comes from the high luminosity of that subphase .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure  [ tesub_fuel ] illustrates the effect of the horizontal branch morphology on the temperature of the subphases .",
    "for the same ages and metallicities two options for the hb morphology are shown , red ( open symbols ) and blue ( filled symbols ) .",
    "we remind that blue / red hbs mean that the whole hb lifetime is spent on the blue / red side of the rr - lyrae strip , while intermediate hb is used to refer to the mixed cases .",
    "blue horizontal branches ( bhbs ) are those in which most of the stars are found at temperatures hotter than @xmath94 , red horizontal branches ( rhbs ) when most of the stars lie at cooler temperatures , intermediate horizontal branches ( ihbs ) for the mixed cases . ] in order to trace properly the hb evolution , we use the evolutionary track for the helium burning phase of the mass that is obtained after mass - loss is applied to the rgb track ( see section  [ hb ] ) . in the hb phase , most fuel consumption occurs on the so - called zero age helium burning ( zahb ) that usually corresponds to a very narrow temperature range , the evolution from the tip - rgb to the zahb and to the zahb to the e - agb happening on very short timescales ( @xmath95 myr ) .",
    "however in presence of strong mass loss like in the case of a bhb at high @xmath96 ( filled circles ) the evolutionary timescale can be significant at various temperature locations .",

    "the latter can not be derived from first principles , and as far as we know it could be connected to several stellar parameters , such as the stellar mass , the evolutionary status or the metallicity , and its calibration with observational data is certainly required .",

    "this effect will be quantified in section  [ uncertainties ] .",

    "the opposite effect is found , i.e. the cassisi tracks appear to have cooler rgbs than the padova ones .",
    "at least part of the effect must originate from the treatment of the mixing - length .",
    "however the metodology by salaris & cassisi  ( 1996 ) depends necessarily on temperature / colour transformations , as the rgb theoretical temperature luminosity relation must be converted into the observed colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "therefore it is hard to push any strong conclusion on which parametrization of the mixing - length is better .",
    "generally , any calibration of stellar tracks depends upon the adopted temperature / colour transformations , and in particular for the coolest part of the rgb these are notoriously uncertain .",
    "the comparison with the padova tracks is the most relevant to evolutionary population synthesis issues , since these tracks are adopted by all existing eps codes except the one presented here .",

    "we will use the average templates .        the stellar temperatures and luminosities during those evolutionary phases that follow episodes of , or suffer themselves of , stellar mass loss ,",
    "can not be predicted by stellar tracks .",
    "this comes from the fact that a theory relating mass loss rates to the basic stellar parameters does not exist .",
    "therefore mass loss has to be parametrized and its efficiency be calibrated with data .",
    "due to such complication we call these stellar phases ` critical ' .",
    "the amount of mass loss is usually parametrized by means of the reimers ( 1977 ) empirical formula @xmath110 , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , logg , @xmath113 stand for mass , emergent luminosity , surface gravity and radius , respectively , of the stellar configuration in its lifetime @xmath114 .",
    "the parameter @xmath115 introduced by fusi pecci & renzini ( 1976 ) takes into account the efficiency of mass - loss . in stars of intermediate mass ( @xmath116 ) ,",
    "mass loss influences significantly their post main sequence evolution , i.e. the energetics and the temperature , along the tp - agb ( section  [ tp - agb ] ) . in low - mass stars ( @xmath117 )",
    "mass - loss occurs also during the rgb , particularly towards the tip , affecting the subsequent hb evolution and hence the hb morphology ( section  [ hb ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the efficiency @xmath115 can not depend too much on metallicity ( renzini  1981 ) , because the observed hb morphology of gcs is almost always red at high - metallicity , implying that mass - loss does not increase significantly with the metal abundance .",
    "renzini  ( 1981 ) evaluates @xmath118 .    in the following sections we describe the modelling of hb and tp - agb .      the amount of mass loss during the rgb phase is computed by integrating the reimers formula along the rgb track .",
    "the efficiency @xmath115 was calibrated by fusi pecci & renzini ( 1976 ) by comparing the mass of rr - lyrae in the instability strip of the metal - poor mw gc m13 ( @xmath93}\\sim-1.5 $ ] ) , with its turnoff mass , and found to be @xmath119 .",
    "this value of @xmath115 is by definition appropriate only at this metallicity and for the rgb tracks used by fusi pecci & renzini  ( 1976 ) and it has to be re - obtained for other chemical compositions and when other stellar models are used .",
    "the approach followed by maraston & thomas  ( 2000 ) was to compute the integrated @xmath120 line , that is very sensitive to the hb morphology ( see also de freitas pacheco & barbuy  1995 ; poggianti & barbaro  1997 ; lee et al .",
    "2000 ) and to compare it with galactic gcs of known ages , metallicities and hb morphologies .",
    "the value of @xmath115 appropriate to @xmath93}\\sim-2.25 $ ] was found to be 0.2 .",
    "the procedure of using one value of @xmath115 per metallicity ( and age ) aims at recovering the average trend of a bluer hb morphologies with decreasing metallicity , the latter being the 1-st parameter ruling the hb morphology .",
    "the trend is easy to understand in terms of stellar evolution . at low",
    "metallicity the evolutionary mass is smaller at given ms lifetime ( because the stars are more compact and hotter and the nuclear burning more efficient ) , therefore the production of hotter effective temperatures by envelope removal is easier ( helped also by the lower metal content ) .",
    "however , as well known a large scatter is found in the hb morphology of gcs with the same nominal metallicity , a still unexplained fact that is recalled as the 2-nd parameter effect .",
    "the account of all possible hb morphologies in a ssp model is not useful , but it is sensible to provide models with a few choices for the hb morphology , that are able to encompass the observed average trend and scatter .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath115 are @xmath121 at @xmath93}=(-2.25 ; -1.35)$ ] .",
    "the correspondent amount of mass loss along the rgb is shown in figure  [ mloss ] , where the mass difference ( in @xmath60 ) between the turnoff mass and the mass in the hb phase is shown as function of age for the two adopted @xmath115 s .",
    "these values are in remarkable agreement with those computed by greggio & renzini  ( 1990 ) using a different set of evolutionary tracks .",
    "the resulting hb morphology is shown in figure  [ hbmor ] by means of the percentage of fuel burned at @xmath122 k , according to the definition of bhb given in footnote 1 , section  [ temperatures ] .",
    "the hb morphology is almost completely blue ( bhb ) at @xmath93}=-2.25 $ ] and @xmath123 gyr , and at @xmath93}=-1.35 $ ] and @xmath124 gyr .",
    "the morphology is red ( rhb ) at ages lower than 6 gyr for @xmath93}=-1.35 $ ] , intermediate ( ihb ) otherwise . at @xmath93}=-2.25 $ ] , the hb morphology is never completely red , because the metallicity is so low that the hb track spends a no negligible amount of fuel bluewards the rr - lyrae strip even without mass - loss ( open symbols in figure  [ hbmor ] ) .",
    "the effect of age is such that the higher the age is , the lower is the stellar mass and the higher is its effective temperature for the same mass loss .",
    "therefore at a given @xmath115 the hb morphology gets bluer with increasing age ( see also lee et al .",
    "the ssp models computed with these choices of @xmath115 have been proven to give a very good match of the @xmath120 line and the mid - uv spectra ( maraston & thomas  2000 ) and of the higher - order balmer lines ( maraston et al .",
    "2003 ) of milky way gcs as function of their total metallicities .    at higher metallicities ,",
    "the hb of milky way gcs is found to be red in almost all cases .",

    "( 2003 ) , the models by maraston & thomas ( 2000 ) were able to reproduce the observed balmer lines of these two clusters by assuming moderate mass - loss along the rgb , implying 10 - 15 per cent of fuel to be spent blueward the rr - lyrae strip .",

    "the ssps with high - z and bhb are computed for the ages of 10 and 15 gyr .    as a last remark ,",
    "the variation of the hb fuel between models with and without mass - loss is of having less fuel in the models in which mass loss is applied , that stems from the lower evolutionary mass ( see figure  [ fuelfasi ] ) .",

    "the relations between envelope and total masses for the turnoff stars with different chemical compositions ( taken from the stellar tracks at the termination of the e - agb ) are used to establish which fractions of them goes into tp - agb fuel as function of metallicity . in this scaling it is assumed that the mass - loss efficiency ( which is derived from the magellanic clouds gcs ) does not depend on metallicity . as a result of this assumption together with the fact that the turnoff mass is rather insentive to metallicity , the total tp - agb fuel does not depend too much on the chemical composition ( maraston et al .",
    "2001 , see figure  [ fuelfasi ] ) .",
    "this is a robust result for two reasons .",
    "1 ) mass - loss is not affected significantly by metallicity , as we discussed in the previous section .",
    "2 ) the tp - agb fuel decreases very little with increasing mass - loss efficiency .",
    "renzini & voli  ( 1981 ) show that by doubling @xmath115 from 0.33 to 0.66 the fuel of a @xmath130 star with solar metallicity decreases by only 20 per cent .",

    "the abundance of oxygen in the envelope is lower and a lower amount of carbon has to be dredged - up in order to reach @xmath131 , hence binding the whole oxygen into co molecules ( those with the highest binding energy ) .",
    "the residual carbon is then available to produce ch , cn , c@xmath132 molecules and carbon stars are made . therefore a metal - poor stellar population is expected to have more carbon stars than a metal - rich one .",
    "quantitatively , the fuel in c - stars doubles by halving the metallicity .",
    "the adopted recipe is given in figure  [ cvsm ] , where the percentage of the tp - agb fuel that is spent by carbon - type stars as a function of metallicity is shown .",
    "the reference metallicity to which the scaling of renzini & voli  ( 1981 ) is applied , is the @xmath133 metallicity ( dotted line ) , because this is the chemical composition of the magellanic clouds gcs that are used as calibrators solar and twice solar metallicities ( solid and short - dashed line , respectively ) are assigned halves and one quarter of the fuel in c - star of the @xmath133 metallicity , respectively . at @xmath93}\\sim-1.35 $ ] ( long - dashed line ) the fuel in c - star is a factor 10 larger than at @xmath133 ,",

    "indeed as one sees from table 3 the latter is insensitive to the presence of a bhb while it increases substantially in presence of a real 2 gyr old population containing tp - agb stars ( figure  20 ) .",
    "the values provided in table  3 allow the evaluation of bhb effects in arbitrary proportions on a stellar population , also when other models from the literature are adopted .",
    "in particular , the values in the table can be applied to the models with variable element abundance ratios by thomas , maraston & bender  ( 2003 , for the lick indices ) and by thomas , maraston & korn  ( 2004 , for the higher - order balmer lines ) .",
    "two types of uncertainties affect the interpretations of the age and the metallicity of an unresolved stellar population by means of ssps models .",
    "the first group collects what we can call _ intrinsic uncertainties _",
    ", in the sense that they belong to the physiology of the model .",
    "these are led by the `` age - metallicity degeneracy '' ( e.g. faber  1972 ; oconnell 1980 ; worthey 1994 ; maraston & thomas  2000 ) , the effect by which a larger metal content produces similar spectral changes as an older age , and vice versa . to this group",
    "belongs the hb morphology and the chemical abundance pattern .",
    "these uncertainties can not be removed , however they can be taken into account by a proper use of the models .",
    "the other class should be called _ transient uncertainties _ , in the sense that a solution can be found at some point . to this group",
    "belong the discrepancies in the model output that are generated by : 1 ) stellar evolutionary tracks ; 2 ) transformations to the observables ; 3 ) eps codes .",
    "charlot , worthey & bressan  ( 1996 ) investigated the origin of the discrepancies in their model @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath141 .",
    "their main conclusions are : a ) the 0.05 mag discrepancy in @xmath108 colour originates from a known limitation of the theoretical spectra ; b ) the 0.25 mag discrepancy in @xmath109 comes from the stellar evolution prescriptions ; c ) lifetimes and luminosities of post - ms phases are problematic .",
    "since different eps codes were used , their approach did not allow the exploration of the sole effect of stellar models .",
    "this is what we shall do here . with the same code",
    "we vary the stellar evolutionary input , i.e. the - energetics and temperatures - matrices while keeping constant the temperature / color / spectra - transformation matrix .",
    "a similar exercise can be found in fioc & rocca - volmerange  ( 1997 ) , where the impact of varying the stellar tracks from the padova to the geneve set is tested .",
    "major differences were found at very young ages ( tenths of myr ) , that are connected with the recipes of mass - loss in massive stars .",
    "however both sets of tracks adopt overshooting , while in the exercise presented here the frascati tracks do not include this parameter , thereby allowing to explore its impact on the spectral evolution . in the following we will focus on colours and spectra , since the influence of the stellar tracks on the lick absorption indices has been discussed by maraston et al .",
    "( 2001b ; 2003 ) .",
    "we also leave out the investigation of the uncertainties in the spectral libraries since it is made in bc03 .    in figure  [ complito ] ( left - hand panel )",
    "we compare selected broadband colours with solar metallicity and various ages as computed with our code and the frascati and the padova stellar tracks ( solid thick and thin lines , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath109 is the most affected by the stellar models . at @xmath142 the value obtained with the padova tracks is redder by 0.08 mag than that obtained with the frascati tracks .",
    "this was expected since the largest difference among the two sets of tracks is the rgb temperature ( figure  [ tergbtracks ] ) .",
    "the difference is not dramatic since the tracks deviate especially towards the tip , where the evolutionary timescale is faster , therefore the fuel consumption smaller .",
    "similar values are found at twice solar metallicity .",
    "the @xmath143 is rather insensitive to the choice of the tracks are not relevant in this context . ] , while the @xmath108 relative to the padova tracks is bluer at the ages at which the overshooting is important , in agreement with the higher ms luminosity of the padova tracks ( figure  7 ) . at old ages the two model @xmath108 are in perfect agreement . as for the metallicity scale",
    "( right - hand panels ) , the largest discrepancies are found when the colors involving near - ir bands are considered , which again stems from the different rgb temperatures .",
    "for example at low metallicities the padova tracks are hotter than the frascati ones , and the relative colours bluer .",
    "therefore an observed colour ( at given age ) is interpreted as connected to a higher metallicity ( e.g. a @xmath109 of 2 requires @xmath93}\\sim -1.7 $ ] for ssps based on the padova tracks , but just @xmath93}\\sim -2.2 $ ] for those based on the frascati tracks ) .",
    "the differences are much smaller in the optical bands .    also plotted are models by other eps codes ( worthey  1994 , vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 , pegase.2 , bc03 and vzques & leitherer 2005 ) .",
    "all these models except those by worthey  ( 1994 ) adopt the stellar evolutionary tracks from the padova database and are computed by means of the isochrone synthesis tecnique . in spite of such harmony of model inputs , sizable discrepancies exist between these models .",
    "interestingly , these type of discrepancies are larger than those induced by the use of different stellar tracks in our code .",
    "for example , the @xmath109 of the pegase.2 models with solar metallicity is nearly 0.2 mag .",
    "redder than that of the vazdekis models , while bc03 agree with the latter in @xmath143 and with pegase.2 in @xmath109 .",
    "note that in none of these other models the agb phase transition is appreciable .",
    "also the metallicity scale shows quite a discrepancy , especially approaching large chemical abundances .",
    "the scatter in the inferred ages and metallicities can be estimated directly from figure  [ complito ] .",
    "we did not attempt a more quantitative evaluation since after all metallicities and ages should not be determined by means of one indicator , rather through a `` grid - like '' approach .    as a final remark ,",
    "the integrated colours of the worthey  ( 1994 ) models are typically redder than those of the other models .",
    "charlot , worthey & bressan  ( 1996 ) attribute the effect to a factor 2 more stars on the upper rgbs of g. worthey isochrones than on the padova isochrones used in the other two eps .",
    "the fuel consumption approach helps to avoid such uncertainties .",
    "as discussed in section  [ energetics ] the onset and development of the tp - agb phase occupies a narrow age range in the evolutionary path of stellar populations , being confined to ages @xmath144 . during this short epoch",
    "the tp - agb phase is the dominant one in a stellar population providing @xmath145 per cent of the bolometric contribution , and up to @xmath146 per cent of that in the @xmath4-band ( figure  [ contrpha ] ) .",
    "therefore the inclusion of the tp - agb phase in a stellar population model is essential for a correct interpretation of galaxies with stellar populations in this age range as discussed in section  [ compsedtp - agb ] .",
    "in particular , the tp - agb phase can be used as an age indicator of intermediate - age stellar populations and its power is to be relatively robust against the age / metallicity degeneracy . in this direction",
    "goes the work by silva & bothun  ( 1998 ) , in which the two agb - sensitive colours j@xmath147h and h@xmath147k were used to constrain the amount of intermediate - age stars in local , disturbed , field ellipticals .",
    "the authors rely on the comparison with colours of real tp - agb stars after noticing that the population models they explored ( worthey 1994 and bruzual & charlot 1993 ) neither reproduced the near - ir colours of local ellipticals nor were in agreement one with each other ( the latter is confirmed by our comparison , see figure  27 ) . here",
    "we add that those models would not be suitable to the aim since they do not include the calibrated contribution by the tp - agb phase ( see 4.2.2 ) .",
    "the possible use of the tp - agb as age indicator for high-@xmath9 galaxies was firstly suggested by renzini  ( 1992 ) .    at high redshifts when",
    "galaxies are dominated by @xmath77 1 gyr old populations as inferred from the ages and element ratios of local early - type galaxies ( thomas et al .",
    "2004 ) , the tp - agb signature in the rest - frame near - ir must show up , with e.g. the rest - frame @xmath109 colour mapping into the observed @xmath148 @xmath149 m at @xmath150 .",
    "this portion of the spectrum became recently available thanks to the advent of the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) .",
    "therefore a straightforward application of the model seds presented in this paper is the interpretation of the high-@xmath9 spitzer galaxies as also discussed in maraston ( 2004 ) .",
    "recently yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) published sst - irac data of galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field , with photometric redshifts ranging from 1.9 to 2.9 . in order to explain the observed seds in the whole spectral range from the rest - frame @xmath151 to @xmath4 , in particular the high fluxes in both the blue and the near - ir",
    ", the authors must combine a dominant stellar population being at least 2.5 gyr old , with traces ( less than 1 per cent in mass ) of a 0.1 gyr old one .",
    "the relatively high age of the ( dominant ! ) old component generally implies very high formation redshifts ( @xmath152 ) , and even exceeds the age of the universe for the highest redshift objects .",
    "this contrived solution is imposed by the evidence of very high observed fluxes in both the optical and near - ir rest frames . as we saw in section  [ fingertp - agb ] and figure  19 ,",
    "high near - ir fluxes in young stellar populations are the fingerprints of tp - agb stars .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore which ages are inferred from the models of this paper",
    ".    figure  [ irac_col ] shows two - colour diagrams in the irac+@xmath4 observed frame , for the three highest-@xmath9 objects of the yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample .",
    "the @xmath153-axis in the right - hand panel corresponds to the rest - frame @xmath109 , that is very sensitive to tp - agb stars ( cf .",
    "figure  20 ) . at the nominal redshift of the objects ( @xmath154 ) the universe is at most 2.3 gyr old in current cosmologies .",
    "the bc03 models ( dotted lines ) used by yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) do not match the intrinsic @xmath109 of the reddest object ( # 3 , right - hand panel ) unless the age becomes 4 gyr , that exceeds the age of the universe . our model ( solid line ) reaches the observed colours using ages around @xmath155 , instead .",
    "the inferred stellar mass for object # 3 is @xmath156 .",
    "the other two objects in figure  [ irac_col ] look younger in this simple diagrams and seem to be in the pre - tp - agb phase .",
    "however , object # 8 has a rest - frame @xmath109 that is too red ( or a rest - frame @xmath157 that is too blue , x - axis ) also for our standard models .",
    "a possible explanation could be reddening by dust , that would affect mostly the rest - frame @xmath5 .",
    "dust reddening was not found to be a promising solution by yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , however this might be also connected with their modelling lacking intrinsically red stars in the stellar population .",
    "a more detailed investigation is clearly beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in a subsequent work .    as a further example figures  [ irac_fit1 ] and [ irac_fit2 ]",
    "show the fits to the whole seds for other two objects of the yan et al .",
    "( 2004 ) sample .",
    "in the first case the best `` by - eye '' solution was found to be a composite stellar population ( with solar metallicity ) in which stars started to form 0.8 gyr ago , with an exponentially - declining star formation mode with e - folding time of 0.1 gyr . in the second case , a single burst ( i.e. an ssp ) of 0.6 gyr with low - metallicity ( @xmath63 ) was instead used . for both objects",
    "the whole spectral energy distributions are fitted reasonably well with lower ages , corresponding to formation redshifts of the order @xmath158 .",
    "the derived stellar masses are @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , in the latter case the mass and the metallicity fits very well the corresponding relation obtained in the local universe for dwarf early - type galaxies ( thomas et al .",
    "this example opens the possibility that at least part of the very red galaxies could be objects caugth during the full development of the tp - agb phase .",
    "the fits shown in figures  [ irac_fit1 ] and [ irac_fit2 ] are quite rudimentary and are meant to illustrate the application of the new models to high-@xmath9 data . the ` best ' solution was searched only `` by eye '' , without the help of statistical tools , which would go far beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "however the match is encorauging and we will analyse more objects and in a more precise way in a future work .",
    "evolutionary population synthesis models with various ages , metallicities , star formation histories , horizontal branch morphologies , are presented .",
    "the evolutionary code is based on the fuel consumption theorem ( renzini & buzzoni  1986 ) for the evaluation of the energetics of the post main sequence evolutionary phases .",
    "the code was introduced in our previous work ( maraston  1998 ) in which stellar population models complete in all main stellar evolutionary phases , but only for solar metallicity were computed .",
    "the present paper provides the extension of the modelling to a wider range of stellar population parameters .",
    "the most important features of the models are : i ) the inclusion of the energetics and the spectra of tp - agb stars and their calibrations with observations ; ii ) the allowance for various horizontal branch morphologies , in particular blue morphologies at high metallicities . we will come back to both points below .    in the first part of the paper we perform a comprehensive analysis of the model ingredients , focusing in particular on : i ) the metallicity effects on energetics and temperatures ;",
    "ii ) the impact of different stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "the most relevant results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the energetics of stellar populations are higher at lower metallicity because of the greater hydrogen abundance .",
    "the most affected stellar phases are the main sequence and the helium burning phase .",
    "the differences become smaller at ages later than the rgb phase - transition ( @xmath161 ) when the rgb phase becomes the most important contributor to the total bolometric .",
    "this is due to the rgb fuel consumption being not affected dramatically by the chemical abundance , a result consistent with previous findings ( sweigart , greggio & renzini  1989 ) .",
    "the impact of stellar evolutionary tracks is evaluated by comparing energetics and temperatures of two different stellar models , namely the set of frascati tracks by cassisi and collaborators , that are classical tracks without overshooting , with those by the padova school , that include the effects of overhsooting .",
    "we find that the mass- luminosity relations for ms stars are rather similar among the explored tracks , which is explained by the modest amount of overshooting included in recent computations . instead",
    ", major differences are found in post - ms phases , which involve both the energetics and the temperatures of the red giant branch . in",
    "the padova tracks the onset and development of the rgb is delayed with respect to the frascati tracks , an effect of overshooting .",
    "for example , a @xmath162 stellar population model based on the padova tracks has @xmath163 per cent less light than one based on the frascati tracks , a result influencing the integrated output , especially the @xmath89 .",
    "it should be noticed that a recent comparison of the onset age of the rgb with what is observed in mc gcs favours the earlier rgb development of the frascati tracks ( ferraro et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the temperatures of the rgb , especially towards the tip are cooler in the padova tracks , at solar metallicity and above , a feature also found in the yale tracks of yi et al .",
    "the rgb temperature is the ingredient having the largest influence on the ssp output .",
    "for example , the integrated @xmath109 colours of old , metal - rich , stellar populations change by @xmath164 .",
    "the rgb temperatures are connected to the mixing - length and the underlying stellar models .",
    "the calibration of these effects is difficult since the comparisons with data require the adoption of temperature - colors transformations , that are uncertain as well . in spite of this",
    ", it would be highly valuable to understand the origin of such discrepancies at least theoretically .",
    "relevant to evolutionary population synthesis models is the following result .",
    "the differences induced by the use of various stellar tracks in our code are substantially smaller than the scatter among stellar population models in the literature that adopt the same stellar tracks .    in the second part of the paper we describe in detail the recipes for the stellar phases that are affected by mass - loss and therefore not described sufficiently by stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "these are the horizontal branch ( hb ) in old stellar populations and the thermally - pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) in stellar populations with ages between 0.2 and 2 gyr . for the hb we apply mass - loss to the rgb tracks such that we obtain a good match to stellar population spectrophotometric indicators that are sensitive to the hb morphology ( e.g. the balmer lines ) .",
    "we therefore calibrate the amount of mass - loss with mw gcs of known hb morphology . in order to account for the observed scatter in the hb properties at a fixed metallicity",
    ", we provide the models with a couple of choices for the hb morphology .",
    "in particular , we also compute blue hb at high @xmath96 and show how much blue indicators like e.g. the balmer lines and the @xmath165 magnitudes are affected .",
    "the effects of bhbs at high @xmath96 are quantified in a form that can be easily used also when other evolutionary population synthesis are adopted .",
    "a result interesting for extra - galactic gc studies is that the d-4000   break , unlike the balmer lines is insensitive not only to age but also to the horizontal branch morphology at low metallicity ( @xmath93}{\\,\\rlap{\\lower 2.5pt \\hbox{$\\sim$}}\\raise 1.5pt\\hbox{$<$}\\,}-1 $ ] ) .",
    "therefore this colour can be used as metallicity indicator in the metal - poor regime .",
    "the energetic of the tp - agb phase was calibrated with magellanic clouds gcs data in maraston ( 1998 ) .",
    "it was shown that this phase is the dominant one in stellar populations with ages between 0.3 and 2 gyr , providing 40 per cent of the bolometric and up to 80 per cent of the luminosity in the near - ir . here",
    "we make a step forward by including the spectra of tp - agb stars in the synthetic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the stellar population models , using available empirical spectra of tp - agb c - rich and o - rich stars .",
    "we compare the resulting model seds with the observed seds of a sample of mc gcs with data from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the models provide a very good fit to the data in the whole age range relevant to the tp - agb , a success that is entirely due to the proper inclusion of the phase in the models .",
    "we further compute the integrated spectral indices @xmath166 in the near - ir ( @xmath167 ) , that are effective tracers of c and o stars .",
    "we find that the combination of @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be used to determine the metallicity of @xmath168 stellar populations , independently of the star formation history .",
    "the model seds presented here can be applied to the analysis of high-@xmath9 galaxies extending the concept of tp - agb as age indicator for @xmath75 stellar populations to primeval objects in the early universe . as an illustrative application we re - analyze some high-@xmath9 ( @xmath169 ) galaxies recently observed with the spitzer space telescope ( yan et al .",
    "the distinctive features of these objects is to have strong fluxes in both the rest - frames blue and near - ir relative to the flux in the @xmath5-band .",
    "this is what characterizes tp - agb dominated stellar populations .",
    "we show that the data can be explained by stellar populations with ages in the range 0.6 to 1.5 gyr .",
    "these ages are comfortable given the age of the universe at those redshifts ( @xmath170 ) and imply formation redshifts between 3 and 6 .",
    "models are available at www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/@xmath171maraston .",
