    "the strong interaction effects in 2d dirac fermion systems have been investigated extensively by applying quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations to the su(2 ) hubbard model , a paradigmatic model for mott physics of interacting electrons @xcite .",

    "it has been pointed out that the alkaline - earth fermion systems respect the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry , owing to their closed shell electron structure .",
    "their hyperfine spins are simply nuclear spins , and thus the inter - atomic scatterings are spin - independent , leading to the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry @xcite .",

    "we focus on the thermal cvbs transition and the interaction - induced pomeranchuk effect of the su(@xmath0 ) dirac fermions .",

    "[ fig : tx ] is that @xmath113 increases monotonically with @xmath2 at a fixed temperature . in the weak coupling regime , this is consistent with the mean - field analysis concluding that the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath109 is enhanced by the repulsive interaction @xcite . in the strong coupling regime",
    ", increasing @xmath2 enhances the amplitudes of the onsite spin moments by suppressing the change fluctuations , and thus @xmath113 is also increased . at small values of @xmath2 ,",
    "a tiny upturn occurs in the @xmath113 curve at low temperatures , which is caused by the finite - size effect .",
    "case , the spin susceptibilities are calculated by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath118 is the density of states . in finite - size system ,",
    "the integration has been transformed into summations .",
    "so the discrete energy levels will take the responsibility of the upturn . in ref .",
    "[ ] , a small upturn is also reported in @xmath113 . ]",
    "considering the su(4 ) and su(6 ) hubbard models on a honeycomb lattice , the af ordering does not occur even in the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , we also present the simulation results of the af structure factors and nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlations in appendix [ app : af ] .",
    "in summary , we have employed the large - scale dqmc simulations to study the effects of su(@xmath0 ) symmetries on thermodynamic properties of dirac fermions .",
    "the dirac fermions are described in terms of the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice which captures the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we have simulated the finite - temperature properties of su(4 ) and su(6 ) cases , including the thermal vbs phase transition , the pomeranchuk effect , the density compressibility , and spin susceptibilities .",
    "we use the su(6 ) case as an example to study the thermal phase transition between the disordered state and the cvbs state on a honeycomb lattice . in the su(2 ) honeycomb - lattice hubbard model , the mott insulating phase at @xmath119 exhibits the af ordering which breaks the continuous su(2 ) symmetry and thus can not exist at finite temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , the cvbs order in the su(6 ) case only breaks a discrete symmetry and does occur in the thermal transition . based on the above reasoning ,",
    "the thermal cvbs phase transition is also expected in the simulations of the su(4 ) honeycomb - lattice hubbard model , though the cvbs order is weaker compared with the su(6 ) case .",
    "the simulation of entropy - temperature relations shows that the @xmath71 curves with different hubbard @xmath2 seprate into two regions at an universal specific entropy @xmath72 characterizing the onset of the pomeranchuk effect .",
    "this universal specific entropy comes from the local spin moment contribution estimated as @xmath120 .",
    "the su(@xmath21 ) cvbs mott insulating state can be reached along the isoentropy curve @xmath80 by the interaction - induced adiabatic cooling , which sheds new light on future explorations of novel states of matter with ultra - cold @xmath6yb experiments .    it is worth noting that , a plateau of @xmath121 is expected to appear in a single @xmath71 curve when hubbard @xmath2 is large enough , due to the full release of spin entropy . in fact , the roles of spin and charge channels in entropy production are separated at @xmath121 , when the coulomb repulsion @xmath2 becomes stronger than the critical interaction that leads to the emergence of the cvbs ground state .",
    "interestingly , in the weak and intermediate coupling regimes , the simulated @xmath71 curves cross at a point where @xmath121 , though @xmath72 is not noticeable in a single @xmath71 curve .",
