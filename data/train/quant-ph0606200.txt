    "in a direct analogy with classical mechanics , composed systems in quantum optics  ( which describe interaction between several subsystems ) can be divided into two classes : 1 ) systems which possess a necessary number of integrals of motion , so that , the classical counterpart is an integrable system ; 2 ) systems that do not admit a sufficient number of integrals of motions , so that , the classical counterpart is a non - integrable system caos . a quantum system can have basically two types of integrals of motion : a ) _ kinematic _ integrals , which do not depend on the kind of interaction between subsystems , as for instance , the total number of atoms ; b ) _ dynamic _ integrals which are related to the particular form of interaction between subsystems , as , for instance , a number of excitations preserved in some transitions between the energy levels of the subsystems .",
    "typical for quantum optical systems dipole - like interactions between two subsystems ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) can be described with a generic multichannel hamiltonian of the following form:@xmath2where the two first terms represent the free hamiltonians of the subsystems , so that the frequencies @xmath3 , and the last term describes the interaction between them .",
    "the operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6=0 $ ] , are usually elements of some deformed algebra @xcite , and in particular , satisfy the ladder commutation relations@xmath7 = \\pm x_{\\pm } ^{j},\\hspace{0.1in}\\left [ y_{0}^{j},y_{\\pm } ^{j}\\right ] = \\pm y_{\\pm } ^{j}.   \\label{escal}\\ ] ]    in the interaction hamiltonian there are two kinds of terms : of the form @xmath8 and @xmath9 it is easy to observe that in the rotating frame , that is , applying the following unitary transformation@xmath10 \\right)\\]]to the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) , the _ counterrotating _ terms @xmath11 oscillate in time with a frequency @xmath12 and the _ rotating _",
    "terms @xmath13 oscillate with a frequency @xmath14 .",
    "it is clear that under the condition @xmath15 the rotating term @xmath8 in ( [ h1 ] ) is approximately time independent ( and thus , can generate transitions with a probability of one between the energy levels of the system ) , meanwhile the counterrotating _ _  _ _ term , @xmath16 always oscillates rapidly in the rotating frame , and its temporal average is zero .    by neglecting the counterrotating terms in the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) , which is commonly called the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , we arrive at the hamiltonian@xmath17which admits several dynamic integrals of motion @xmath18 , generally not allowed in ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the whole representation space of the system is divided into finite dimensional invariant subspaces , and the mathematical treatment is essentially simplified .",
    "it is worth noting , that the semiclassical models , when some of the subsystems are described by @xmath19-numbers instead of operators , are treated using essentially the same type of hamiltonians as ( [ h1 ] ) . the semiclassical transition in ( [ h1 ] )",
    "can be done by going to the rotating frame of the semiclassical system and then , just substituting the transition operators by some complex numbers .",
    "for instance , in the case of single channel interaction , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , when the system @xmath1 acquires classical features , the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) in the rotating frame corresponding to the system @xmath1 takes the form @xmath22so that the corresponding semiclassical hamiltonian is obtained by substituting @xmath23 giving@xmath24such hamiltonians usually appear when a quantum oscillator and/or a collection of atoms is pumped by an external force @xcite , cohen , @xcite .    in the rwa - like systems , described by hamiltonians of the form ( [ h3 ] ) , the resonance conditions@xmath25means that the term @xmath26 , which explicitly appears in the hamiltonian , does not depend on time in an appropriate rotating frame",
    "nevertheless , such _",
    "explicit resonances _ are not the only kind of resonances , which can be found in the hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) . usually , the composed systems admit several types of _ implicit resonances _ related to effective transitions , which do not appear in the original hamiltonian , between their energy levels .",
    "such effective interactions play important roles in many physical applications and can be revealed by adiabatic elimination of slow transitions @xcite .",
    "the implicit ( effective ) resonances are characterized by their position , @xmath27 , and strength , i.e. in what order of perturbation expansion they appear for the first time .",
    "although , a generic system can possess a large number of different types of effective transitions , all the possible resonance conditions can be classified only by analyzing the free hamiltonian and the integrals of motion .",
    "because all the invariant subspaces are finite - dimensional , there are always a finite number of different resonances",
    ". we will refer to these kinds of resonances as _",
    "kinematic resonances _ , which include both explicit and implicit resonances . in sec .",
    "ii we show with the example of atom - field interactions , that it is possible to classify all the kinematic resonances in a straightforward way .",
    "the situation is quite different in quantum systems with a lack of integrals of motion , corresponding to classically non - integrable dynamic systems . in such systems",
    "an infinite number of different resonances arise and _ a priori _ it is impossible to determine their position and strength , which essentially depend not only on the type of interaction but also on the algebraic properties of each interacting subsystem @xcite , bombeo , @xcite . in sec.iii",

    "it is worth noting that ( [ tg ] ) is not a unique way to represent a generic interaction term .",
    "since the rotating wave approximation is imposed , every interaction term should preserve the total number of excitations , so the condition@xmath65 = 0,\\]]is held , and thus , the numbers @xmath66 satisfy the following restriction @xmath67thus , any admissible interaction can be described as@xmath68the interaction ( [ git ] ) becomes resonant when the atomic transition energies and the field frequency satisfy the following condition@xmath69the important point here is that interaction terms ( [ git ] ) can be explicitly presented in ( [ hc1 ] ) , or can describe effective interactions , and thus should be obtained from the original hamiltonian by adiabatic elimination of some far - off resonant transitions .",
    "so that , the condition ( [ resc ] ) describes _ explicit _ resonances if the corresponding interaction term is present in the original hamiltonian or _",

    "it is clear that the total number of both explicit and implicit resonances is finite , which is a consequence of the restriction ( [ k ] ) imposed by the rotating wave approximation .",

    "to be able to use the effective hamiltonian in the form ( [ heff ] ) we first rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hc ] ) in the floquet form by making use of the phase operators @xmath253 , which are generators of the euclidean algebra : @xmath254 = -\\delta _ { jk}e_{j},\\quad \\left [ e_{0j},e_{j}^{\\dagger } \\right ] = \\delta _ { jk}e_{j}^{\\dagger } , \\quad \\left [ e_{j},e_{k}^{\\dagger } \\right ] = 0 .   \\label{ej}\\]]each group of operators ( labeled with the same index @xmath51 ) acts in a hilbert space spanned on the eigenstates of the ( hermitian ) operator @xmath255@xmath256so that in the basis ( [ ejes1 ] ) the operators @xmath257 act as rising - lowering operators : @xmath258the phase states @xmath259 , the eigenstates of @xmath260 @xmath261 , are not normalized .",
    "now , let us consider the following time independent hamiltonian @xmath262it is easy to observe that the average value of the above hamiltonian over the phase states in the rotating frame , @xmath263where @xmath264 are the basis states ( [ ejes1 ] ) , coincides with the hamiltonian ( [ hc1 ] ) due to @xmath265the hamiltonian ( [ hf ] ) is a floquet form of the initial time dependent hamiltonian ( [ hc1 ] ) ( from now on we put all the phases @xmath266 equal to zero ) . in the case of weak driven fields , @xmath267 , the hamiltonian ( [ hf ] ) can be represented in a form of expansion over the principal resonances which can be observed in this system according to ( [ heff ] ) .    in the single channel case , the dicke model in the classical field , we have the classical problem , first solved by shirley @xcite ( for a single two level atom ) .",
    "let us consider a collection of @xmath28 two level atoms in a linearly polarized em field .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has the form @xmath268where @xmath191 is the classical field frequency .",
    "the floquet form of ( [ hdicke ] ) is @xmath269the following identifications @xmath270so that @xmath271 lead to @xmath272 which immediately leads to the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) @xmath273averaging the above hamiltonian over the phase states we obtain an effective time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath274which means that only odd resonances , @xmath275 , appear in this system .",
    "this result is different from the atom - quantum field interaction ( and surprisingly can not be obtained from the corresponding quantum hamiltonian ( [ hdeff ] ) by substituting the field operators by @xmath276numbers ) , because in this case the structural function ( [ estruc ] ) for the euclidean algebra ( [ ej ] ) is a constant , that is , a zero - th degree polynomial function .",
    "quantum systems possessing as the integral of motion the operator corresponding to the total number of excitations ( classically integrable systems ) admit a simple classification of possible resonant transitions , which are separated into explicit ( which appear in the original hamiltonians ) and implicit ( effective ) resonances .",
    "the total number of such resonances is always finite and depends on the number of atoms and of atomic levels . by a simple algebraic manipulation of the free hamiltonian and the integrals of motion",
    ", one can obtain some specific conditions for the frequencies of interacting subsystems , which define the implicit resonances .",
    "nevertheless , the form of the interaction terms associated with each implicit resonance condition can be found only after obtaining the effective hamiltonian ( in a perturbative way ) .",
    "quantum systems not preserving the total number of excitations ( classically non - integrable systems ) do not admit a simple classification of admissible resonant transitions .",
    "the explicit form of the effective hamiltonian is needed to specify the allowed resonances , and their number is always infinite .",
    "such non - linear ( on the generators of some lie algebra ) hamiltonians can be represented as a series of operators describing all the possible transitions , which might become resonant under specific relations between frequencies of interacting subsystems .",
    "the structure of the effective hamiltonian essentially depends on the algebraic structure of interacting subsystems ( polynomials @xmath277 ) .",
    "in particular , it is reflected in the types of resonances which are allowed for a given system .    in the vicinity of each resonant transition",
    "all of the other transitions can be considered as a perturbation .",
    "thus , in the course of evolution some specific finite - dimensional subspaces in the hilbert space of the whole system are approximately preserved , and for each of these invariant subspaces there is a corresponding integral of motion .    this work is partially supported by the grant 45704 of consejonacional de ciencia y tecnologia ( conacyt ) .",
    "the method of lie - type transformation ( small rotations ) @xcite , @xcite provides a _ regular _ procedure for obtaining approximate hamiltonians describing the effective dynamics of nonlinear quantum systems .",
    "the idea of this method is based on the observation that several quantum optical hamiltonians can be written in terms of polynomially deformed algebras @xmath278 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , bonatsos93 , @xcite , @xcite , @xmath279where the operators @xmath280 and @xmath171 are generators of the deformed algebra and satisfy the following commutation relations ( [ escal ] ) , and @xmath281=p(x_{0 } ) ,   \\label{xpmt}\\]]where @xmath282 is a polynomial function of the diagonal operator @xmath171 with coefficients that may depend on some integrals of motion @xmath283 if @xmath284 is a linear function of @xmath171 , the usual @xmath285 or @xmath33 algebras are restored . if for some physical reason ( depending on the particular model under consideration ) @xmath286 is a small parameter , the hamiltonian ( [ hintt ] ) is _ almost _ diagonal in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath171 and can be approximately diagonalized by applying in a perturbative manner the following unitary transformation ( a _ small nonlinear rotation _ ) @xmath287 .   \\label{u1}\\]]applying the transformation ( [ u1 ] ) to the hamiltonian ( [ hintt ] ) according to the standard expansion",

    "the higher - order contributions always have the form @xmath304 .",
    "this makes the procedure of removing the off - diagonal terms somehow trivial at each step , in the sense that it is always obvious which transformation should be applied . for example , to eliminate the terms of the form @xmath305,\\]]it suffices to apply the transformation @xmath306with @xmath307 , since the first commutator of @xmath308 with @xmath309 cancels the corresponding term in the hamiltonian .",
