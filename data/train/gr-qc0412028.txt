    "linearly polarized cylindrical waves , also known as einstein - rosen waves @xcite , provide a symmetry reduction of general relativity that can be used as a test bed for the quantization of the theory .",
    "this system displays several interesting features that contribute to its relevance . on one hand",
    "it has an infinite number of local degrees of freedom and , hence , it is a genuine quantum field theory ( in contradistinction to other symmetry reductions , such as bianchi models , that have a finite number of global degrees of freedom ) . on the other ,",
    "the system is tractable both classically and quantum mechanically , thus allowing to derive exact consequences independent of any approximation scheme @xcite .",
    "the main reason behind this success and tractability is the fact that the gravitational degrees of freedom of the model are encoded in an free , massless , axially symmetric , scalar field that evolves in an auxiliary minkowskian background .    in previous papers",
    "we have analyzed the issue of microcausality in this system ; in particular , we have studied in detail the smearing of light cones owing to the quantization of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the main tool for this type of analysis is the study in vacuo of the field commutator evaluated at different spacetime points . as is well known the commutator of quantum fields reflects the causal structure of spacetime ( minkowskian spacetime in ordinary perturbative quantum field theory ) in the sense that the quantum fields in spatially separated spacetime points commute",
    "this is true for all standard types of quantum fields , i.e. scalar , fermion , or vector fields though issues related to gauge invariance must be carefully considered in this last case. in the specific model that we are interested in , gauge invariance has been discussed in ref .",
    "the authors of that paper conclude that it is correct to use the ashtekar - pierri gauge fixed action , written in terms of the axially symmetric scalar field , to derive gauge invariant information about the model .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite we discussed the situation when no cut - off is introduced in the system , studying the unregulated commutator .",
    "the main results reached were the following .",
    "first , one can clearly see that light cones are smeared by quantum gravity effects ; in fact it is possible to obtain a quantitative measure of this smearing and show how sharp light cones are recovered in the limit of large distances as compared to the natural length scale of the model the planck length. it is also interesting to point out that the asymptotic behavior of the commutator in the different physically relevant regimes strongly depends on the causal relationship between the different spacetime points involved .",
    "second , one finds a singularity structure in the commutator that differs from that of the free theory ; in particular the field commutator for equal values of the radial coordinate @xmath0 is singular .",
    "finally one observes that , in the case when one of the spacetime points that appear in the commutator corresponds to the symmetry axis , there are quantum effects that persist for large values of the difference of the time coordinates .",
    "this effect is reminiscent of the large quantum gravity effects first discussed by ashtekar @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study how the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite are changed by the introduction of a cut - off . as is well known regulators are generally necessary in order to have well defined quantum field theories .",
    "one can justify its use , for example , by noticing that the action of the field operator on the vacuum in a fock space is not a vector in the hilbert space because it has infinite norm . in order to have a well defined action of the field operator one",
    "regulates it by introducing smearing functions that render the norms of these states finite .",
    "the problem then consists in removing these regulators ( or rather showing that the physical results are independent of them ) .    in principle , it is possible to argue that the results derived in the absence of regulators somehow approximate those derived after their introduction ; this is straightforward to see in the case of cut - offs . in the presence of a cut - off @xmath1 , the improper integrals that define the field commutator become proper because the integration region is a closed interval @xmath2 $ ] . for a given value of the parameters that appear in the integral ( involving the values of the spacetime coordinates of the quantum fields and the gravitational constant )",
    "it is always possible to choose a value for @xmath1 such that the integral with the cut - off is well approximated by the integral extended to @xmath3 .",
    "of course it is conceivable that the cut - off is not just a mathematical device but rather a physical scale defining a fundamental limit for the resolution of our measurements .",
    "if spacetime becomes discrete at short distances ( such as the planck length ) the continuum spacetime picture breaks down and , certainly , it would be difficult to justify the extension of the integrals involved in the definition of field commutators ( or @xmath4 matrix elements , for that matter ) to infinite intervals in momenta ( inverse length ) .",
    "our point of view here is that the introduction of a cut - off can mimic some of the effects appearing after a successful quantization of gravity ( for example , in the loop quantum gravity approach ) and hence we plan to study its effect within the consistent framework provided by the einstein - rosen waves .",
    "it is also interesting to point out here that the cut - off by itself can produce some of the effects expected from quantum gravity . in particular , it is possible to show that light cones are also smeared by cut - offs . in our opinion",
    "this makes it necessary to study in detail how the effects of the cut - off and quantum gravity can be disentangled .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we briefly review the main results about microcausality in quantum cylindrical gravitational waves and introduce the commutators that we will discuss in the rest of the paper . we will then study the field commutators in the presence of a cut - off with the help of the asymptotic techniques already employed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the situation is simpler because we will only have to consider integrals over closed intervals .",
    "we will discuss one by one the asymptotic behaviors in the different parameters involved . in sec .",
    "vi we will derive a power series expansion in the gravitational constant for the commutator in the presence of a cut - off in the spirit of ordinary perturbative quantum field theory , and discuss the uniform convergence of this series under appropriate conditions on the cut - off in sec .",
    "we end the paper with a discussion of our results and our conclusions .",
    "einstein - rosen waves describe topologically trivial spacetimes with two linearly independent , commuting , spacelike , and hypersurface orthogonal killing vector fields @xcite endowed with a metric that can be written as @xmath5 here we use the coordinates @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are functions only of @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",

    "it is also possible to show @xcite that @xmath19 coincides with the hamiltonian @xmath20 of the system obtained by a linearization of the metric ( [ metric ] ) .    in order to have a unit asymptotic timelike killing vector and a physical notion of energy ( per unit length ) we introduce the coordinates @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 . in these coordinates the metric takes the form @xcite @xmath23 by taking a sufficiently fast fall - off for @xmath7 as @xmath24 , this metric describes asymptotically flat cylindrical spacetimes such that @xmath25 is a unit timelike killing vector in the asymptotic region . in the 2 + 1 dimensional framework",
    "these spacetimes are asymptotically flat at spacelike and null infinities @xcite ( the appropriate introduction of null infinity will be needed in order to study the @xmath4 matrix of the model ) .",
    "it is also worthwhile noting that these spacetimes have a non - zero deficit angle .",
    "the einstein field equations can be obtained from a hamiltonian action principle @xcite .",
    "a remarkable ( and useful ) feature of the physical hamiltonian @xmath26 ( associated with the physical time @xmath27 ) is the fact that it is a function of the hamiltonian corresponding to the free scalar field , @xmath20 : @xmath28    in terms of the @xmath9-time and imposing regularity at the axis @xmath29 @xcite , the classical solutions for the field @xmath7 can be written as @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and its complex conjugate @xmath32 are fixed by the initial conditions .",

    "@xmath67 denotes the imaginary part and @xmath68 .",
    "physically , the cut - off @xmath56 ( which in principle has the dimensionality of an inverse length ) could be interpreted as having its origin in the existence of a minimum length .",
    "this comes out naturally in loop quantum gravity where space is discrete and the area and volume operators have minimum eigenvalues of the order of the planck area and volume , respectively .",

    "this integral can be written as a standard @xmath72-transform @xcite by the change of variables @xmath73 .",

    "this is the kind of behavior that one would expect even in a lorentz covariant theory after the introduction of a cut - off because of the breaking of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "the novel feature here is the presence of cut - off independent terms .",
    "although the cut - off dependent one dominates in the asymptotic limit , there may be a transient regime whose onset will be controlled by the value of @xmath56 in which the asymptotic behavior is given by the first term .",
    "this will be most evident when @xmath80 .    in the @xmath81 limit",
    "we get @xmath82 as a result of the continuity at @xmath71 of the integral defining the commutator ( [ newintegral ] ) .",
    "the integral in ( [ newintegral ] ) has the convenient form of an @xmath72-transform and , hence , it can be studied by standard mellin transform methods @xcite if the asymptotic parameter is chosen to be @xmath70 ; however this is no longer true if the asymptotic parameter is taken to be @xmath83 ( which corresponds to considering large separations in the time coordinates ) .",

    "it is also remarkable how slowly the commutator decays in @xmath83 in particular in the axis @xmath71 , a fact that is suggestive of the large quantum gravity effects discussed by ashtekar @xcite . outside the axis",
    "the decay is faster but still quite slow .",
    "a consequence of the different asymptotic behaviors in @xmath83 for @xmath71 and @xmath84 is the impossibility to recover ( [ tauasimpr0 ] ) as the limit when @xmath89 of ( [ tauasimprneq0 ] ) .",
    "as we can see , the frequency of the oscillations of the commutator in @xmath83 is controlled by @xmath90 ( proportional to the inverse of @xmath61 ) in such a way that although the amplitude of the oscillations decays very slowly they will average to zero on scales larger than the planck length .",

    "this can be obtained by straightforward integration by parts .",
    "an interesting situation develops at this point because the asymptotic behavior of the integral in @xmath83 behaves in a discontinuous way in the cut - off . in the analysis carried out to study the asymptotic behavior in @xmath70 we found out that the cut - off dependent term , in spite of being dominant , goes to zero in the limit @xmath80 .",
    "here the situation is different : taking now @xmath80 in ( [ tauasimptlamb ] ) does not lead to the asymptotic expressions corresponding to @xmath92 .",
    "that is , the asymptotic behavior of the improper integral in ( [ integral ] ) is not the limit when @xmath80 of ( [ newintegral ] ) . as in the case of the asymptotics in @xmath70",
    ", one expects that there must be a transient regime in which the behavior in @xmath83 of ( [ newintegral ] ) is given by ( [ tauasimpr0 ] ) and ( [ tauasimprneq0 ] ) .",
    "we will not consider here a precise characterization of this transient behavior for arbitrary values of the relevant parameters because its main properties can be conveniently discussed , at least for large @xmath90 , by looking at the @xmath93 asymptotics of the commutator in the ( @xmath94 ) plane .",
    "the @xmath95 limit is easy to analyze .",
    "in fact what we find , both with and without the cut - off , is that the series obtained by expanding @xmath96 in powers of @xmath97 , exchanging integration and infinite sum , and computing the resulting integrals gives a series that converges to the value of the commutator .",
    "the asymptotic behavior in @xmath90 is studied by following the procedure described in ref .",
    "it is worth remarking that the limit @xmath93 of the regulated field commutator can not be identified with that in which the gravitational constant @xmath61 vanishes if one admits that the dimensionful cut - off @xmath98 is kept constant in principle . on the contrary ,",
    "the two limits could be considered equivalent only under the assumption that @xmath56 increases as the inverse of @xmath61 for small gravitational constant , so that its dimensionless counterpart @xmath68 may remain fixed .",
    "the analysis of the asymptotics in @xmath90 when the cut - off is present is simultaneously simpler in some respects and more complicated in others compared with the case when no cut - off is introduced .",
    "it is simpler because the lengthy analysis needed to discuss the asymptotics of the improper integral is not necessary now .",
    "it is more complicated in the sense that the final asymptotic expressions contain additional terms and also because the number of regions with different @xmath90-asymptotic regimes in the @xmath99 plane increases .",

    "in particular we have seen that some of the most dramatic effects present when the cut - off is infinite ( in particular the behavior of the field commutators in the symmetry axis ) are now somewhat mitigated .",
    "nevertheless we have been able to show that the approximation provided by the unregulated field commutator is a good one in some regions of the @xmath99 plane , and , in fact , there is an unbounded region where that approximation prevails .",
    "this indicates that , even though the influence of the cut - off is felt in some regions of the parameter space , it is irrelevant in others .    in secs .",
    "vi and vii , on the other hand , we have considered the expansion of the field commutator in terms of the gravitational constant @xmath61 .",
    "we notice , nonetheless , that condition ( [ pert ] ) on the cut - off @xmath56 , that guarantees the convergence of the series , depends on @xmath61 . at this stage , one possibility would be to admit that the cut - off depends on the gravitational constant ; however , the expansion obtained would then fail to provide a genuine power series in @xmath61 , because this parameter would also enter the different terms in the series via the implicit dependence of @xmath56 on it .",
    "another possibility that indeed respects the interpretation of our expansion as a power series in @xmath61 is the following . employing that condition ( [ pert ] ) is an inequality equation for @xmath56 given in terms of a function of @xmath61 that is strictly increasing , it is easy to see that the inequality is satisfied for all values of @xmath61 in a certain interval @xmath245 $ ] if and only if it is satisfied for @xmath246 .",

    "in other words , to ensure the convergence of the series for @xmath249 $ ] and any time difference in @xmath250 $ ] , we only have to demand the requirement ( [ pert ] ) at @xmath251 and @xmath252 , because then @xmath253    in this way we arrive at a cut - off that is independent of the particular values considered for @xmath254 and the gravitational constant ( in the commented intervals ) , and our expansion becomes a true power series in @xmath61 .",
    "the above inequality leads to the following positive upper bound for @xmath56 : @xmath255 therefore , with a cut - off that satisfies this condition , the power series ( [ vaser ] ) converges in the interval @xmath245 $ ] for all radial positions @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath256}$ ] .",
    "when @xmath257 is small , the bound on @xmath56 is approximately @xmath258 , whereas for large @xmath257 it is nearly equal to @xmath259 .",

    "an open question is whether it is possible or not to find a different , non - zero time - independent cut - off such that the expansion of the regulated commutator converges for any value of the time elapsed , i.e. for all @xmath261 .",
    "we expect to encounter convergence problems when the time interval is unbounded ; for instance , one can prove that the series ( [ vaser ] ) does not converge uniformly in @xmath262 with any choice of the cut - off @xmath56 ( for generic @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "nonetheless , one can in fact consider a kind of semi - classical limit in which @xmath246 tends to zero ( and hence so does the value of the gravitational constant , that had been restricted to @xmath245 $ ] ) , while the time interval where the convergence is granted reaches infinity .    in order to do this ,",
    "one only needs to allow a dependence of @xmath257 on @xmath246 , so that the assumed maximum value of the time difference varies with that of the gravitational constant .",
    "suppose , let us say , that @xmath263 with @xmath264 .",
    "then , the bound ( [ cutgt ] ) on the cut - off becomes @xmath265 thus , when @xmath246 tends to zero , we get the asymptotic behavior @xmath266 . since @xmath267 and @xmath268 diverge for vanishing @xmath246 , because @xmath264 , we therefore conclude that the cut - off can be removed in the limit @xmath269 while ensuring that the time interval @xmath270 $ ] , where the expansion is well - defined , covers the positive real axis .",
    "we finally discuss the physical interpretation of this type of cut - off .",
