    "the upgraded mipp experiment is designed to measure the properties of strong interaction spectra form beams @xmath0 and @xmath1 for momenta ranging from 1 gev / c to 120 gev / c .",
    "the layout of the apparatus in the data taken so far can be seen in figure  [ layout ] .",
    "the centerpiece of the experiment is the time projection chamber , which is followed by the time of flight counter , a multi - cell cerenkov detector and the rich detector .",
    "the tpc can identify charged particles with momenta less than 1  gev / c using de / dx , the time of flight will identify particles below approximately 2 gev / c , the multi - cell cerenkov detector is operational from  2.5 gev / c to 14  gev / c and the rich detector can identify particles up to 120 gevc . following",
    "this is an em and hadronic calorimeter capable of detecting forward going neutrons and photons .",
    "the experiment has been busy analyzing its data taken on various nuclei and beam conditions .",
    "the table  [ runtable ] shows the data taken by mipp i to date .",
    "we have almost complete acceptance in the forward hemisphere in the lab using the tpc .",
    "the reconstruction capabilities of the tpc can be seen in figure  [ tpc ] .",
    "the particle identification capabilities of the tpc can be seen in figure  [ tpcdedx ] .",
    "the time of flight system provides further measurement of the particles with momenta less than 2  gev / c .",
    "figure  [ tof ] shows the time of flight data where a kaon peak is clearly visible .",
    "mipp has published forward going neutron spectra off various nuclei and compared it with monte carlo predictions  @xcite        it can be seen clearly that the monte carlo predictions differ significantly from each other and the data .    figure  [ numidata ] shows ( in a paper in preparation ,  @xcite ) preliminary results of particle production from the full numi target as a function of momenta .",
    "the mipp upgrade proposal consists primarily of an electronics upgrade of the whole detector so that the detector reads out at 3  kilohz as compared to 20  hz in run i. all the new electronics modules have been prototyped .",
    "the tpc has the largest data rate and we display one of its elctronics modules in figure  [ tpcchips ] .",
    "the document  @xcite contains the details of the upgrade proposal .",
    "the mipp upgrade proposal will acquire high quality data of particle production with high statistics and much improved particle identification .",
    "the available beam momenta and the calculated beam rates can be seen in table  [ mippbeam ] and range approximately 1  gev / c to 120 gev / c .",
    "as such the upgrade can straddle the resonance region and the scaling region of strong interaction physics using 6 beam species .",
    "the mipp upgrade intends to acquire data for a variety of interactions .",
    "these include    * a systematic study of missing baryon resonances between 1  gev and 3  gev .",
    "* an investigation of fundamental scaling laws in inclusive reactions . * a thorough investigation of forward neutron spectra . * a systematic acquisition of particle production data and comparison and tuning of existing monte carlo generators . * a measurement of particle production data from full scale neutrino targets and using the data to improve the target design .",
    "* a systematic study of hypernuclei * measurement of cross section off nitrogen targets which is essential to understanding the cosmic ray showers and atmospheric neutrino production for experiments such as ino .",
    "this is made possible since mipp upgrade will be able to collect 5  millions events per day assuming a beam spill rate of one 4 second spill every 2 minutes ,    .calculated beam rates for @xmath2 protons on primary target for mipp upgrade[mippbeam ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "single strange hypernuclei ( with one @xmath3 or one @xmath4 ) have production cross sections in the 100 to 250 nbarn / steradian at 1 to 2 gev / c proton beams on nuclear targets as can be seen for figure  [ single ] .",
    "doubly strange hypernuclei ( with two @xmath3 ) are 10 to 50 nbarn / sr with a kaon or hyperon beam on nuclear target and are more difficult to measure . the diagrams for doubly strange hypernuclei can be found in figure  [ double ] .",
    "doubly strange hypernuclei with one @xmath5 are not discovered yet , but 7 candidate events are known to exist .",
    "the binding energies for nuclei as a function of atomic weight can be found in figure  [ binding ] .",
    "the binding energies decrease with atomic weight indicating that the hypernuclei are less tightly bound as atomic weight increases .",
    "this behavior is also reflected in the lifetimes plot in figure  [ lifetimes ] where the lifetimes of the bound lambda is seen to decrease with increasing atomic weight .",

    "we investigate the channels that are likely to yield hypernuclei .",
    "we employ the high energy physics notation to denote the reactions .",
    "the channels involving a @xmath7 beam can be denoted by @xmath8 in the above equation , @xmath7 beam remains a @xmath7 beam and fragments a proton target to form a @xmath6 and a @xmath3 .",
    "such reactions are called diffractive dissociations of the target and these maintain a large cross section as the beam energy increases .",
    "the @xmath6 in the final state is detected by the tpc and the time of flight systems and the @xmath3 is absorbed in the nucleus to make the hypernucleus .",
    "there may be other particles in the finally state , which the particle identification of mipp will ensure contain a net strangeness of zero .",
    "the counterpart of the above reaction with a neutron target can be written @xmath9 the @xmath10 in the final state can be detected by the tpc .",
    "similarly with a proton beam @xmath11 @xmath12 these form the proton counter part . using a k@xmath13 beam",
