    "elliptical and s0 galaxies ( hereafter , collectively referred to as early - type galaxies , etgs ) present a striking regularity in their luminosity distribution .",
    "the etg surface brightness is well fitted by the well known @xmath9 profile @xcite , while considerable better results are obtained using the sersic @xmath10 law @xcite . from the photometric point of view , therefore , etg may be considered as characterized by only three parameters , namely the slope @xmath3 of the sersic profile , the effective radius @xmath2 containing half of the total luminosity , and the effective surface brightness @xmath11 defined as @xmath12 , or equivalently the average surface intensity @xmath13 .",
    "the etg kinematic may be schematically characterized through its central velocity dispersion @xmath0 which , under suitable assumptions on the mass profile , gives information on the mass and hence the mass - to - light ( hereafter @xmath14 ) ratio .",
    "being a mass tracer , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath0 is somewhat correlated to the total luminosity @xmath5 , even if it is difficult to forecast an analytic form for such a correlation , given the subtleties of the luminous and dark components modelling .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that empirical searches for such a correlation were early undertaken .",
    "a remarkable success was represented by the faber - jackson ( fj ) @xmath15 relation @xcite .",
    "the large scatter in the fj law led to the need for higher dimensional representations of etgs .",
    "considering @xmath16 , there remains just three parameters describing an etg so that one could wonder whether a relation exist among the photometric quantities @xmath17 and the kinematical @xmath0 .",
    "this relation were indeed found @xcite and , when expressed in a logarithmic scale , is just a plane soon dubbed the _ fundamental plane _ ( fp ) .",
    "it is worth noting that such a plane was not unexpected .",
    "indeed , a simple application of the virial theorem gives @xmath18 , under the hypotheses of constant @xmath14 ratio and structural homology .",
    "the observed fp plane is however tilted , i.e. one indeed finds @xmath19 , but with @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 as forecasted before @xcite . such a tilt may be easily explained introducing a power - law correlation @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) , but interpreting the origin of such a relation is a difficult and ambiguous task due to proposals ranging from non - homology @xcite , to stellar populations effects @xcite , from systematic variations in kinematical structure @xcite to a combination of different terms @xcite .    although the de vaucouleurs profile is a satisfactory fit , it is well known that the sersic profile has to be preferred @xcite . as such , forcing @xmath16 in the fit may systematically bias the estimate of @xmath2 and @xmath24 and hence affect the fp . introducing @xmath3 increases the number of parameters needed to describe etgs leading to wonder whether scaling relations exist .",
    "actually , given the observational difficulties in measuring @xmath0 , it is worth looking for empirical correlations involving only the photometric parameters .",
    "interesting examples are the kormendy relation ( kr ) between @xmath2 and @xmath11 @xcite and the scalelength - shape relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , just as the fj relation is a projection of the fp , both the @xmath2-@xmath11 and the @xmath2-@xmath3 relations may be seen as projections of a more fundamental law among these three photometric parameters . in logarithmic units ,",
    "such a relation indeed exists and it is a plane referred to as the _ photometric plane _ ( php ) recently detected in both near infrared @xcite and optical @xcite . while observationally the php is confirmed also at intermediate redshift ( la barbera et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) , a definitive theoretical interpretation is still lacking . modelling the stars in etg as a self - gravitating gas , lima neto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recovered a php like relation ( referred to as the _ entropic plane _ ) by assuming that the specific entropy ( i.e. , the entropy for mass unit ) is constant for all etgs .",
    "later , mrquez et al . ( 2001 ) derived an _ energy - entropy _ ( or _ mass - entropy _ ) line giving a possible explanation for the structural relations among photometric parameters .",
    "moreover , they also find out that the specific entropy increases as a consequence of merging processes so offering a possible way to test the model against the observed variation of the php with redshift .",
    "there are two general lessons to draw from the above short summary .",
    "first , two dimensional scaling relations turn out to be projections of a more general three dimensional law .",
    "it is therefore worth wondering whether this also holds for the fp and php being possible projections of a four parameters law .",
    "it is worth noting that a first step towards this direction has been attempted by graham ( 2002 ) fitting a hyperplane ( in logarithmic units ) to the set of parameters @xmath25 , but it was never prosecuted . on the other hand , from a theoretical point of view , both the entropic plane and the fp",
    "are tentatively explained on the implicit assumption that etgs are in a state of dynamical equilibrium so that the virial theorem applies and the boltzmann - gibbs entropy may be evaluated . motivated by these considerations , here we investigate whether a four dimensional relation among photometric and kinematic quantities may come out as consequence of the virial theorem and some assumptions on the stellar @xmath14 consistent with stellar population synthesis models",
    "should such a relation exist , one could thus reconcile both the fp and the php under the same theoretical standard thus representing a valid tool to investigate etg formation theories .",
    "as a first key ingredient , we describe in sect .",
    "2 the assumed mass models for both the luminous and the dark components of etgs . in sect .",
    "3 , we first compute the quantities entering the virial theorem according to the model detailed above and then obtain the four dimensional scaling relation we are looking for . in order to test whether our derivation is consistent with what is observed , we simulate etg samples that are as similar as possible to a large sdss based sample following the procedure extensively discussed in sect .",
    "the results of such a testing procedure are described in sect . 5 , while sect . 6",
    "is devoted to fit our theoretical relation to the observed data using a bayesian approach .",
    "discussion and conclusions are finally held in sect .",
    "although some recent results show the presence of thin discs in inner regions of elliptical galaxies , etgs may be well described as a luminous stellar distribution embedded in a dark matter halo dominating the outer mass profile . in the following",
    ", we will assume spherical symmetry for both these components . while this is an acceptable hypothesis for the halo , it is clearly an oversimplification for the elliptical luminous component .",
    "nevertheless , this will allow us to get analytical expressions for the main quantities we are interested in without dramatically affecting the main results .      under the hypothesis of constant @xmath14 , the surface density of the luminous component",
    "may be easily obtained as :    @xmath26    with @xmath4 the @xmath14 ratio and @xmath27 the surface luminosity density .",
    "as well known , the sersic @xmath10 law @xcite is best suited to describe the surface brightness distribution of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "motivated by these evidences , we will therefore set :    @xmath28 \\right \\ } } \\label{eq : ir}\\ ] ]    with @xmath29 the luminosity density at the effective radius @xmath2 and @xmath30 a constant defined such that the luminosity within @xmath2 is half the total luminosity .",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath30 may be found by solving @xcite :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the incomplete @xmath33 function and @xmath34 the actual @xmath33 function .",
    "useful approximating formulae may be found in graham & driver ( 2005 ) and references therein , but we will exactly solve eq.([eq : bn ] ) in the following .",
    "assuming cylindrical symmetry , the luminosity profile within @xmath35 is :    @xmath36    with @xmath37 and    @xmath38    the total luminosity .",
    "the volume luminosity density @xmath39 may be easily obtained deprojecting @xmath27 . defining @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 the radius in spherical coordinates ) ,",
    "we get @xcite :    @xmath42    with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "some algebra finally leads to the following expressions for the mass density @xmath45 and the mass profile @xmath46 :    @xmath47    @xmath48    where we have denoted with @xmath49 the total stellar mass :    @xmath50    having used the abuse of notation    @xmath51    finally , to get eqs.([eq : rhostar ] ) and ( [ eq : massstar ] ) , we have used the auxiliary functions :    @xmath52}}{\\left ( x^2 - s^2 \\right ) ^{1/2 } } dx } \\",
    ", \\label{eq : definu}\\ ] ]    @xmath53    both these functions can not be analytically expressed , but are straightforward to be numerically evaluated .",
    "most of the kinematical tracers of the total gravitational potential are usually affected by a severe degeneracy between the luminous component and the dark one so that there are different dark halo models able to fit the same data for a given stellar mass profile .",
    "it is therefore important to rely on a physical theory of halo formation to select models which are both compatible with the data and also physically well motivated . from this point of view , numerical simulations of galaxy formation in hierarchical cdm scenarios are very helpful since they predict the initial shape of the dark matter distribution . here",
    ", we assume a nfw profile @xcite as initial dark matter halo and neglect the effect of the baryons gravitational collapse .",
    "the main features of the nfw model are :    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    @xmath57    @xmath58    where @xmath7 is the concentration parameter , @xmath8 the virial mass and @xmath59 the virial radius is @xmath60 times the critical density @xmath61 . according to the concordance @xmath62cdm model",
    ", we assume a flat universe with @xmath63 where @xmath64 . ] .",
    "the model is fully described by two independent parameters , which we assume to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "numerical simulations , supported by observational data , motivate a correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 so that the nfw model may be considered as a single parameter family .",
    "following bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we adopt :    @xmath65    with a log normal scatter @xmath66 .",
    "the nfw model is not the only model proposed to fit the results of numerical simulations .",
    "some authors @xcite have proposed models with a central slope steeper than the nfw one . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the inner slope does not reach any asymptotic value with the logarithmic slope being a power - law function of the @xmath41 @xcite or that the deprojected sersic profile also fits the numerical dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "however , the difference between all these models and the nfw one is very small for radii larger than 0.5@xmath67 - 1@xmath67 the virial radius so that we will not consider models other than the nfw one .",
    "elliptical galaxies are known to be characterized by scaling relations among their kinematic and structural parameters . in an attempt to investigate whether such empirical laws may be recovered under a single theoretical scheme",
    ", we can rely on the hypothesis of statistical equilibrium .",
    "in such an assumption , the virial theorem holds :    @xmath68    with @xmath69 and @xmath70 the total kinetic and potential energy respectively .",
    "both these quantities may be evaluated given the assumed spherical symmetry as we detail in the following .      neglecting the net rotation velocity of the system ( which is reasonable , given the low values of @xmath71 in elliptical galaxies ) , the total kinetic energy is given as @xcite :    @xmath72    with @xmath73 the star surface density and @xmath74 the luminosity weighted velocity dispersion projected along the line of sight . for a spherically symmetric system , assuming an isotropic velocity dispersion tensor , it is :    @xmath75    with @xmath76 the total mass profile . as a first step ,",
    "it is convenient to split the integral in eq.([eq : defsigmap ] ) in two terms separating the dark halo contribution from the luminous one .",
    "it is then easy to get :    @xmath77    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is obtained by replacing @xmath80 with @xmath81 into eq.([eq : deffnfw ] ) .",

    "it is rather its central value @xmath87 averaged within a circular aperture of radius @xmath88 which is measured by the galaxy spectrum .",
    "we therefore evaluate :    @xmath89 dr}}{2 \\int_{0}^{r_e/8}{\\rho_{\\star}(r ) \\left [ { \\cal{a}}_0(r_e/8r ) - { \\cal{a}}_0(0 ) \\right ] r dr } } \\ , \\label{eq : sz}\\ ] ]    with @xcite :    @xmath90    @xmath91    when evaluating eq.([eq : sz ] ) , we make the simplifying assumptions @xmath92 since the dark halo mass is negligible with respect to the stellar one over the range interested by the integral . by such an assumption ,",

    "should we use eq.([eq : cmvir ] ) , the virial mass @xmath8 would be the only parameter related to the dark halo properties",
    ".      the computation of @xmath70 may be carried out in a similar way starting from the definition @xcite :    @xmath104    splitting the total density and mass as the sum of the luminous and dark components , after some algebra , one gets :    @xmath105    with @xmath98 denoting the same set of parameters as above . the dimensionless quantity @xmath106 is defined as :    @xmath107    it is then only a matter of algebra to demonstrate that :    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    it is worth noting that , while @xmath3 and @xmath2 directly enter the integrals above , @xmath4 and @xmath29 only work as scaling parameters through @xmath49 .",
    "moreover , a qualitative analysis shows that the first term in eq.([eq : defwpar ] ) turns out to be the dominating one so that @xmath106 is essentially a function of @xmath3 only .",
    "inserting eqs.([eq : endk ] ) and ( [ eq : endw ] ) into eq.([eq : virtheo ] ) and solving with respect to @xmath0 , we get :    @xmath112    it is then convenient to introduce :    @xmath113    so that the total stellar mass is @xmath114 and the relation above can be recast as :    @xmath115    let us suppose for a while that it is possible to neglect the dark halo component",

    "although determining how the ratio @xmath118 depends on @xmath119 needs for a full computation of the integrals involved , we can , as first approximation , suppose that @xmath118 is linear in a logarithmic scale .",
    "it is possible , therefore , to write :    @xmath120 } \\simeq a \\log{\\langle i_e \\rangle } + b \\log{r_e } + c \\log{(n/4 ) } + d \\ .",

    "in particular , having expressed @xmath2 in linear rather than angular units makes @xmath124 dependent on the distance to the galaxy .",
    "a second important caveat is related to our starting hypothesis of having neglected the dark halo component .",
    "actually , we do know that galaxies are embedded in their dark matter haloes . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath118 is a function of the halo parameters too .",
    "to take into account this dependence , we still assume eq.([eq : linearratio ] ) , but let @xmath124 be an unknown function of @xmath126 to be determined by the data .    with all these caveats in mind , eq.([eq : svh ] ) defines an hyperplane in the logarithmic space allowing to express the kinematic quantity @xmath127 as a function of the photometric parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "since we have recovered it for a sersic model under the hypothesis of virial equilibrium , we will call it the _ sersic virial hyperplane_.    should our assumptions hold for real elliptical galaxies , the sersic virial hyperplane ( hereafter svh ) should represent a tight scaling relations among kinematic and photometric parameters . for an idealized sample of galaxies perfectly satisfying our working hypotheses and all at the same distance , the scatter around this hyperplane should be generated by essentially two terms .",
    "first , the halo parameters @xmath126 may differ on a case - by - case basis .",
    "this is the same as saying that the dark matter content in the inner regions or , equivalently , the global @xmath14 ratio ( defined as @xmath131 rather than @xmath132)is different from one galaxy to another . on the other hand , @xmath133 in eq.([eq : svhpar ] ) may scatter from one galaxy to another because of different values of the parameters @xmath134 of the @xmath135 relation because of different details of the stellar evolution process .",
    "note that this latter effect may also affect the coefficients @xmath136 thus further increasing the scatter on the svh .",
    "it is worth stressing that the svh may be seen as a generalization of both the fp and php which , from this point of view , reduce to particular cases of the svh . indeed , forcing the de vaucouleurs model to fit the galaxies surface brightness profiles is the same as setting @xmath16 in eq.([eq : svh ] ) . solving with respect to @xmath129 ,",
    "we get :    @xmath137    which is indeed the fp with    @xmath138    actually , we do not expect that the coefficients of the observed fp are equal to what is predicted by eq.([eq : fppar ] ) since , assuming @xmath16 in the fit , can bias the estimate of @xmath139 in a way that depends on what the true value of @xmath3 is .",
    "moreover , the departure of @xmath3 from @xmath16 introduces a further scatter which is not included in the above expression for @xmath140 .",
    "although these effects have to be carefully quantified , it is nevertheless worth stressing that the fp turns out to be only a projection of the svh on the plane @xmath141 so that its coefficients may be ( at least , in principle ) predicted on the basis of physical considerations .    on the other hand , when solving eq.([eq : svh ] ) with respect to @xmath129 , we can also neglect the dependence on @xmath127 assuming this latter is , in a rough approximation , the same for all galaxies .",
    "we thus get :    @xmath142    with    @xmath143    which is indeed the php . note",
    "that , since @xmath127 is obviously not the same for all galaxies , the scatter in the php may then be easily interpreted as a scatter in @xmath127 and hence in the kinematic structure of the galaxies .",
    "the derivation of the svh in eq.([eq : svh ] ) relies on two main hypothesis which are analytically formalized in eqs.([eq : linearratio ] ) and ( [ eq : linearups ] ) .",
    "while the relation @xmath144 may be tested resorting to stellar population synthesis models , checking the validity of eq.([eq : linearratio ] ) needs for a detailed computation of @xmath118 as function of the photometric parameters @xmath145 , the stellar @xmath14 ratio @xmath4 and the halo parameters @xmath126 .",
    "performing such a computation over a fine grid in this six dimensional space is prohibitively expensive .",
    "we can however rely on a different and more reliable approach . rather than evaluating @xmath118",
    ", we simulate a sample of galaxies with given values of the above parameters and use the set of equations in sect.3 to compute @xmath0 and the ratio @xmath146 .",
    "we thus end up with a sample of _ simulated measurements _ of @xmath147 which we fit with the svh thus determining the coefficients @xmath148 .",
    "let us then assume that our simulated sample have the same distribution for the parameters @xmath149 as a real sample .",
    "let us then denote with @xmath150 the values obtained by fitting the svh to the observed sample .",
    "should our assumptions be satisfied , we have to find :    @xmath151    with @xmath152 an estimate of the slope of the @xmath153 relation .",
    "moreover , the scatter in the observed svh should be the same as the one evaluated by the simulated sample .",
    "actually , since we do not have a model independent guess for @xmath152 , we can estimate @xmath152 as @xmath154 or as @xmath155 .",
    "the two estimates thus obtained should of course be equal thus giving a further check on the validity of the model .      in order to carry on the approach detailed above",
    ", a key step is a sample of etgs as large as possible . to this aim ,",
    "we have started from the nyu value - added galaxy catalog ( hereafter , vagc ) which is a cross - matched collection of galaxy catalogs maintained for the study of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite and mainly based on the sdss data release 4 @xcite . among the vast amount of available data , we use the _ low - redshift _",

    "note that , although the petrosian radii do non depend on any fitting , the ratio @xmath170 is correlated with @xmath3 so that the two criteria are somewhat redundant .",
    "removing one of them or changing the order does not alter in a significant way the final sample .",
    "we exclude all galaxies with @xmath171 since the dispersion velocity measurements for these systems may be problematic @xcite .",
    "elliptical galaxies are segregated in a well defined region of the color - magnitude plane . in order to further restrict our sample ,",
    "we therefore impose the cut @xmath172 with @xmath173 . here",
    ", @xmath174 is the absolute magnitude in the @xmath41 filter and the parameters @xmath175 have been tailored from fig.2 in bernardi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) where a different etg sample has been extracted from the sdss dr2 .",
    "the final sample thus obtained contains 5142 galaxies out of an initial catalog containing 24387 objects .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the rejected objects have been excluded by the first three cuts ( retaining only 5172 entries ) , while the fourth cut only removes 30 further galaxies .",
    "this is reassuring since the last cut is somewhat qualitative and based on a different set of selection criteria @xcite .",

    "some remarks are however in order .",

    "a meaningful comparison should therefore rely on the same fitting method and we advocate the use of our bayesian approach in order to not underestimate the intrinsic scatter . as a second issue",
    ", one has also to consider that our sample is made out of all etgs in the lowz catalog without any separation in field or clusters objects .",
    "it is therefore worth reconsidering the fit and hence the scatter by performing the fit on smaller subsamples separated according to their environment .",
    "this is outside the aims of this introductory investigation and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "early type galaxies may be considered as a homogenous class of objects from many point of views . a further support to this idea",
    "is represented by the existence of several interesting scaling relations among their photometric and/or kinematic parameters , the most famous ones being the fp ( between @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 ) and the php ( where @xmath127 is replaced by the sersic index @xmath3 ) . in an attempt to look for a unified description of both these relations , we have presented here the _ sersic virial hyperplane _ ( svh ) expressing a kinematical quantity , namely the velocity dispersion @xmath0 as a function of the sersic photometric parameters @xmath308 . in the usual logarithmic units , such a relation reduces to a hyperplane ( i.e. , a plane in four dimensions ) where all etg lay with a small thickness as inferred from the low intrinsic scatter @xmath299 .",
    "just as the fj relation is a projection of the fp and the kr a projection of the php , thus we find that both the fp and the php are projections of the svh so that the scatter in these well known relations can be ascribed to neglect one of the svh variables .",
    "our derivation of the svh relies on very few assumptions .",
    "first , etgs are postulated to be in dynamical equilibrium so that the virial theorem applies .",
    "given that etgs are old systems likely to have formed most of their stellar content and settled their main structural properties at @xmath309 @xcite , this hypothesis seems to be well founded , at least as a first well motivated approximation . starting from this premise ,",
    "the svh comes out as a consequence of the virial theorem and of eqs.([eq : linearratio ] ) and ( [ eq : linearups ] ) .",
    "the first one relies on an approximated log - linear relation between the model dependent quantity @xmath118 and the sersic photometric parameters , while the second one assumes the existence of a power - law relation between the stellar @xmath14 ratio @xmath4 and the total luminosity @xmath5 .",
    "given mass models for the luminous and dark components of a typical etg , eq.([eq : linearratio ] ) has been verified by realistic simulations reproducing the distribution in the photometric parameters of a large etg sample selected from the low redshift version of the vagc catalog based on sdss dr2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relation @xmath144 is expected on the basis of stellar populations synthesis models and is also invoked to explain the fp tilt .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that here the tilt of the svh is due to the dependence of the stellar @xmath14 on @xmath5 , while , in the case of the fp , such a relation involve the global ( stellar plus dark ) @xmath14 ratio . as a consequence",
    ", one has to resort to a mechanism coupling the dark and luminous mass density profiles in order to have @xmath310 , while here we only rely on what is predicted by stellar population synthesis models . from this point of view",
    ", therefore , the svh relies only on known physics without the need of any unexplained interaction between baryons and cdm particles .    the discussion in sect .",
    "5 have confidently demonstrated that the observed svh is consistent with our theoretical predictions so that it is worth wondering how the present introductory work can be ameliorated . to this aim",

    "( 2005 ) to estimate the sersic parameters does not work very well .",
    "the recovered values of @xmath311 and hence of @xmath312 are biased in a complicated way depending on the values of the parameters themselves .",
    "modeling this bias and taking care of it in the fitting procedure is quite difficult , but the problem should be coped with by checking how it affects the estimate of the svh coefficients .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that this problem does not impact anyway our testing of the svh .",
    "however , to test the svh , one has to verify that , for a given distribution of photometric parameters based on a whichever real sample , the simulated sample and the observed one predict the same svh coefficients which is indeed what we find .",
    "note also that this method allows to automatically include the selection effects in the simulation without the need for accurately modelling them .",
    "the data we have used present , however , a second shortcoming , i.e. there is no estimate of the uncertainties on the sersic photometric parameters . as shown in eq.([eq : lnl ] ) , these quantities enter the definition of the merit function to be minimized in the bayesian determination of the svh coefficients .",
    "although one can estimate what the effect is by artificially attaching measurement errors to the input quantities , it is more convenient to solve the problem by resorting to a different sample in order to address the problem hinted above .",
    "the recently released millenium galaxy catalog @xcite contains a detailed bulge / disc decomposition of @xmath313 nearby galaxies with detailed fitting of the sersic law to the surface brightness profile @xcite .",
    "the code is tested and shown not to be biased and the errors on the photometric parameters are available .",
    "cross - matching with the sdss and selecting only the etgs should provide an ideal sample to test the svh retrieving a more reliable estimate of its coefficients and scatter thus allowing to reconsider it as a distance indicator .    from a theoretical point of view , it is worth reconsidering our basic assumptions .",
    "as discussed above , the tilt of the svh with respect to the virial theorem predictions may be fully ascribed to a power - law relation between the stellar @xmath14 ratio @xmath4 and the total luminosity @xmath5 . although estimating the slope @xmath152 from the tilt is , in principle , possible , confronting with an expected value is welcome .",
    "to this aim , one can resort to stellar population synthesis models @xcite by varying the different ingredients entering the codes and looking ( by trial and error ) for the combination giving the slope @xmath152 needed to reproduce the correct svh tilt .",
    "should these stellar models be able to reproduce the observed colors of etg , our derivation of the svh could be further strengthened .",
    "a fundamental role in the etg modeling has been played by the choice of the dark halo model .",
    "although the nfw mass density profile is the standard one , it is nevertheless well known that it encounters serious difficulties in explaining the inner rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies ( see , e.g. , de blok 2005 and refs . therein ) . moreover , some recent evidences from the planetary nebulae dynamics have put into question the need for a significative amount of dark matter in the inner regions of elliptical galaxies @xcite . estimating the dark matter content for the real galaxies is difficult , but we can rely on what we know from the modeling of the simulated galaxies since they reproduce the same svh as the observed ones . defining the dynamical mass differ from those one would obtain using the formula in padmanabhan et al .",
