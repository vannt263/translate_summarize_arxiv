    "the study of exclusive non - leptonic weak decays of @xmath12 mesons provides not only good opportunities for testing the standard model ( sm ) but also powerful means for probing different new physics scenarios beyond the sm .",
    "the mechanism of two body @xmath12 decay is still not quite clear , although many physicists devote to this field .",
    "the hadronic effects must be important while a reliable calculation of these effects is very difficult @xcite .",
    "starting from factorization hypothesis @xcite , many approaches have been built to explain the existing data and made some progress such as generalized factorization @xcite , qcd factorization ( bbns ) @xcite , perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite , and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "these approaches separately explained many of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays though some flaws existed in different approaches .",
    "recently , @xmath15 decays such as @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , have aroused many interests of physicists .",
    "it is known that both longitudinal and transverse polarization states are possible in @xmath18 decay modes .",
    "so , the theoretical analysis of @xmath19 is more complicated than @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the predictions of those decays polarization fractions according to the naive factorization do not agree with the experimental results , although many ideas @xcite have been proposed to explain this phenomenon .",
    "some people think that it is a signal of new physics @xcite .",
    "very recently , both babar and belle have measured the branching ratios and polarizations of the decays @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite , some decay modes have very large branching ratios .",
    "the longitudinal polarization fractions are also very large , which are different from that of @xmath24 .    in this paper , we will study the branching ratios , polarization fractions and cp violation parameters of @xmath25 decays in the pqcd approach . at the rest frame of @xmath12 meson",
    ", the @xmath12 meson decays to light vector mesons with large momentum .",
    "because the two light mesons move fast back to back , they have small chance to exchange soft particles , therefore the soft final state interaction may not be important . a hard gluon emitted from the four quark operator kicks the light slow spectator quark in @xmath12 meson with large momentum transfer to form a fast moving final state meson .",
    "therefore , the short distance hard process dominates this decay amplitude . in this factorization theorem ,",
    "decay amplitude is written as the convolution of the corresponding hard parts with universal meson distribution amplitudes , which describe non - perturbative hadronic process of the decay .",
    "because the sudakov effect from @xmath26 and threshold resummation @xcite , the end point singularities do not appear .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section:2 ] , we give some ingredients of the basic formalism .",
    "the numerical results for branching ratios and cp asymmetry are given in section  [ sc : result ] and [ sc : cp ] respectively .",
    "we summarize our work at section [ sc : sum ] .",
    "the recently developed pqcd approach is based on @xmath26 factorization scheme , where three energy scales are involved @xcite .",
    "the hard dynamics is characterized by @xmath27 , which is to be perturbatively calculated in pqcd .",
    "the harder dynamics is from @xmath28 scale to @xmath29 scale described by renormalization group equation for the four quark operators .",
    "the dynamics below @xmath30 is soft , which is described by the meson wave functions .",
    "the soft dynamics is not perturbative but universal for all channels .",
    "based on this factorization , the @xmath31 decay amplitude is written as the following factorizing formula @xcite , @xmath32 , \\label{eq : convolution1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 denotes the trace over dirac and color indices .",
    "@xmath34 is wilson coefficient of the four quark operator which results from the radiative corrections at short distance .",
    "the wave function @xmath35 absorbs non - perturbative dynamics of the process , which is process independent .",
    "the hard part @xmath36 is rather process - dependent and can be calculated in perturbative approach .",
    "@xmath37 is chosen as the largest energy scale in the hard part , to kill the largest logarithm .",
    "the jet function @xmath38 , called threshold resummation , comes from the resummation of the double logarithms @xmath39 .",
    "the sudakov form factor @xmath40 , is from the resummation of double logarithms @xmath41 @xcite .      in this paper",
    ", we use the light - cone coordinates to describe the four dimension momentum as @xmath42 .",

    "operators @xmath80 come from tree level interaction , while @xmath81 are qcd - penguin operators and @xmath82 come from electroweak - penguins .",
    "similar to the @xmath83 decays @xcite , there are eight types of feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath84 decay mode at leading order , which are shown in fig .",
    "they involve two types : the emission and annihilation topologies .",
    "each type is classified into factorizable diagrams , where hard gluon connects the quarks in the same meson , and non - factorizable diagrams , where hard gluon attaches the quarks in two different mesons . through calculating these diagrams",
    ", we can get the amplitudes @xmath85 , where @xmath86 standing for the longitudinal and two transverse polarizations . because these diagrams are the same as those of @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath87 @xcite , the formulas of @xmath31 are similar to those of @xmath88 or @xmath87 .",
    "we just need to replace some corresponding wave functions , wilson coefficients and corresponding parameters .",
    "so we do nt present the detailed formulas in this paper .    .",
    "in our calculation , some parameters such as meson mass , decay constants , the ckm matrix elements and the lifetime of @xmath12 meson @xcite are given in table  [ para ] .",

    "[ contribution ] , we consider full contribution in line @xmath91 , ignore annihilation contribution in line @xmath92 , without all penguin operator in line @xmath93 , and without non - factorization diagram in line @xmath94 . from this table",
    ", we can see that neither annihilation diagrams nor non - factorizable diagrams can change the polarization fraction in decay @xmath89 .",
    "they only take about @xmath95 contribution in this decay mode just because the emission diagram occupy very large part of the contribution , which can also be seen from table  [ ratio ] .",
    "however , the penguin operators especially in annihilation diagrams play an important role in decay @xmath90 .",
    "of course , the final state interaction is very important in non - leptonic @xmath12 decays",
    ". they can give @xmath96 corrections @xcite , but this can not change the branching ratios much for decay modes @xmath2 and @xmath11 at order @xmath5 .",
    "thus , in these two decay modes , the final state interaction may not be important .",
    "however , in decay @xmath90 , the final state interaction may afford larger contribution than our calculation ( @xmath97 ) , that s to say , our perturbative part may not be the dominant contribution .",
    "although probably important , the hadronic effects are not intensively discussed in this paper , since they are beyond the topics of our pqcd approach .",
    "the contributions of these two sides can be determined by experiments .",
    "studying cp violation is an important task in @xmath12 physics . in this section , we discuss the cp violation in @xmath89 and @xmath99 decays .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath100 for branching ratios is so large that we will not discuss their cp violation here , though it is also very important . in decay modes @xmath101 and @xmath99 , longitudinal part occupy nearly @xmath102 contribution .",
    "so we will neglect the transverse parts in the following discussions .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ m_h],[m_h_2 ] ) , the direct cp violating parameter is easily derived as a function of ckm angle @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath103 which is shown in fig.[adirect ] .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry is about @xmath104 in decay @xmath89 .",
    "however , the direct cp in decay @xmath11 is almost zero , because there is no qcd penguin contribution while electroweak penguin contribution is rather negligible . on the other hand , because of large penguin contribution , the direct cp in @xmath105 is about @xmath106 , which is even larger than @xmath89 .",
    "the uncertainty in above results come from @xmath107 and @xmath108 in @xmath12 meson wave function .     as a function of @xmath44 with @xmath55 .",
