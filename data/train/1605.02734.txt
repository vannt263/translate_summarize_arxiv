    "classifying states of matter is one of the primary goals of condensed matter physics .",
    "first , the study of symmetries led to the landau classification of ordered states of matter that spontaneously break a subset of the microscopic symmetries .",
    "decades later it was discovered that even systems with no broken symmetries may still be distinguished by their topological order@xcite .",
    "more recently , the combination of symmetry and topology have led to exciting developments in the field of symmetry - protected topological phases , such as time - reversal invariant topological insulators@xcite.while the underlying mathematics allows one to distinguish these phases in principle , often it is important how to distinguish them in practice in an experiment .",
    "helpfully , some of the most striking effects of conventionally ordered , and topologically ordered , phases can be seen in their electromagnetic properties . for example , a ferromagnet has a spontaneously generated magnetic moment , and the fractional quantum hall effect has a quantized fractional hall conductance .    while the electromagnetic response properties provide remarkable signatures , they are not the full story . for example , in topological superconductors there will be no such quantized electromagnetic response coefficients . in these cases one can resort to studying the response to strain , thermal gradients , or , in general , deformations of the geometry@xcite .",
    "superconductors are not the only systems that are sensitive to these probes , as recently there has been an intense research effort on the geometric response of integer / fractional quantum hall systems@xcite , topological insulators@xcite , and topological semimetals@xcite .",
    "these systems all have interesting electromagnetic properties , but their geometric responses , for example the hall viscosity@xcite , provide a more complete picture .",
    "the majority of the work on geometric response has been directed at two dimensional systems , but in this article we focus on 3d systems of interest : the spontaneously - generated axion insulator and its parent state the weyl semimetal ( wsm)@xcite . the axion insulator studied here is a 3d gapped phase with a dynamical axion @xmath2-angle .",
    "it arises from a wsm state that is unstable to the formation of a charge density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "once the cdw forms , the wsm is gapped , and the resulting insulating state has a dynamical  axion \" field @xmath3 : the phase of the cdw order parameter .",
    "both the parent wsm state and the axion insulator ( ai ) have unusual electromagnetic and geometric responses@xcite , and we predict even more observable phenomena in this article , including responses that rely on an interplay between the conventional cdw order parameter and the topological electronic structure .    a main focus of this article is to study the interplay between the dynamical axion string ( i.e. , a vortex in the cdw order parameter ) and the background torsional defects arising from crystal lattice dislocations . we demonstrate that the effective coupling between axion and torsion fields indicates a (  two - loop \" ) statistical string interaction between an axion string and a screw dislocation line , as well as a three loop statistical interaction between two dislocation loops threaded by an axion string .",
    "most importantly , we show that this system can also exhibit a dislocation driven chiral magnetic effect , i.e. , an electromagnetic response created from a geometric origin .    the main result of this work is the effective electromagnetic and geometric theory for the anomalous response of a dynamical axion insulator coupled to geometric deformations .",
    "we find several new effects due to the coupling between a dynamical axion field ( e.g. , axion string defects ) and lattice dislocations including new examples of purely geometric responses as well as mixed geometric - electromagnetic phenomena . for example , we show an electromagnetic response effect driven by lattice dislocation density .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the instability of a wsm to form an ai phase in the presence of cdw order .",
    "we also provide the theoretical setup for the inclusion of axion string defects and geometric deformations .",
    "in section iii we review the anomalous response of wsms to electromagnetic and geometric perturbations .",
    "we review the axial and stress anomalies , including a geometric contribution to the axial anomaly , and show how the theory depends on the momentum / energy separation of the weyl nodes .",
    "section iv presents new results focused on the interplay between axion strings and lattice dislocations in the ai system ; we mention a mutual statistical interaction and a possible three - loop statistical interaction . in section",
    "v we present possible electromagnetic response properties of the wsm and ai phases due to the dynamical axion field and the existence of lattice dislocations .",
    "we also talk about two types of analogous geometric effects including a geometric version of the chiral magnetic effect and a geometric witten effect .",
    "we conclude in section vi and give some calculational details in appendix a.",
    "let us begin by briefly reviewing the theory of the dynamical axion insulator as proposed in ref .",
    ", and then discussing how this theory is coupled to geometric perturbations .",
    "the ai is generated by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in three dimensional weyl semimetals@xcite .",
    "for a ( two - node ) wsm , breaking the chiral symmetry is accomplished by a commensurate translation symmetry breaking that nests the weyl nodes . by turning on an attractive interaction to induce a cdw instability that nests two weyl points ,",
    "the weyl cones can be gapped , and the resulting gapped state is an axion insulator. hence , the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking order parameter is just a cdw order parameter , and the phase of the cdw ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. , the goldstone mode , is identified as the axion field .    to proceed more explicitly",
    ", we can start from a simple wsm with only two nodes , and gap out the two weyl cones by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the weyl semimetal is stable in the presence of weak interactions if we prohibit pairing and scattering between the two weyl cones .",
    "a four - fermion interaction with a finite coupling constant @xmath4 can induce chiral symmetry breaking ( along with translation symmetry breaking ) .",
    "this symmetry breaking dynamically generates an energy gap with magnitude @xmath5 that lowers the ground state energy compared to that of a nominally gapless system .",
    "indeed , ref . showed that when a critical interaction strength is reached , an effective mean - field hamiltonian with broken chiral symmetry written as @xmath6is expected .",
    "the first two terms are the effective hamiltonian of the wsm where the @xmath7 are spin pauli matrices , the @xmath8 are pauli matrices for the valley index , and @xmath9 the shift vector @xmath10 is half of the momentum separation between two weyl cones / valleys .",
    "the mass term should be identified as a cdw order parameter which nests between the two weyl cones , and @xmath11 is the scattering wave vector between the two weyl points .",
    "interestingly , in the gapped phase , the wsm is converted into an axion insulator .",
    "the phase angle field @xmath2 of the cdw vector @xmath12 is a goldstone mode that couples with the electromagnetic response in the form of a theta term@xcite : @xmath13 additionally , if there is a vortex - like configuration in the cdw order , the defect line acts as a dynamical axion ( or cosmic ) string which carries gapless chiral modes , where the chirality is determined by the axion string vorticity .",
    "it has also been shown that it is natural to view the axion strings in this model as dislocations of the cdw crystal order@xcite .",
    "thus , since our interest is in the geometric response of such materials , we might expect an interesting interplay between the response due to deformations of the underlying lattice and that of the electronic cdw order .",
    "we are now ready to set the stage for our work by first reviewing the properties of an axion string configuration , and then coupling this model to the background geometry of the distorted underlying lattice .",
    "let us assume we are in the gapped ai phase , and that a vortex ( axion string ) of the cdw phase angle ( i.e. , a dislocation of the cdw order ) is present such that @xmath14where @xmath15 is the vortex field . in the presence of such a configuration",
    ", one can always eliminate the spatial dependence of the mass term by performing the chiral transformation @xmath16 after the chiral gauge transformation , the mass term becomes vortex free , but there is a side - effect because a new axial gauge field term is introduced in the lagrangian : @xmath17where @xmath18 and we have dropped the primes on the fermion fields for convenience .",
    "note that the chiral transformation removed the term proportional to @xmath19 in the lagrangian that would have otherwise contributed to @xmath20 as a constant shift .",
    "apart from the change of the lagrangian , it is well known that such a chiral transformation also generates an anomalous term from the fermion path integral measure @xmath21 which we will come back to later@xcite .",
    "now let us apply a strain / displacement of the background lattice .",
    "this is introduced through a distorted metric tensor , which we decompose into the usual frame - fields .",
    "thus , we introduce the spatial frame fields @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 and couple them to our theory . for the majority of our article we will only focus on a specific set of distortions in order to represent our main point of interest : screw dislocations oriented parallel to the @xmath25-direction ( i.e. , parallel to the axion string for convenience ) .",
    "the relevant distortions are contained in the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields which , in terms of the usual elasticity fields , are written @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the lattice displacement in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "the diagonal elements of the frame are undistorted @xmath30 and all other components are chosen to vanish .",
    "hence , if @xmath29 is non - uniform , then the background metric is distorted , and the distortion is reflected by the non - vanishing frame fields @xmath31 .",
    "if we consider a screw dislocation parallel to the @xmath25-axis , then traveling around the dislocation line we are expected to accumulate a burgers translation vector with a @xmath25-component : @xmath32    the final model in the presence of an axion string configuration and the geometric distortion is written as @xmath33 we have seen that the @xmath34 field originates from a vortex of the mass term , i.e. , a dislocation of the cdw order . thus , as mentioned above , it is natural to expect some interesting interplay between the axion string appearing from the cdw defect and a screw dislocation of the underlying crystal lattice . remarkably , as we discuss further below , after introducing the frame fields , the chiral transformation we performed to remove the phase of the mass term will generate additional anomalous terms from the path integral measure that depend on the geometric distortion .",
    "our goal in the remainder of the article is to carefully derive and discuss these anomalous response terms .",
    "before we detail the properties of the ai phase , we first discuss the effective theory of the interplay between axion strings and crystal dislocation lines in weyl semimetals , i.e. , the gapless parent state of the ai .",
    "we start from the wsm phase with two weyl nodes ( with nodal separation @xmath35 ) , and turn on the electromagnetic field ( @xmath36 ) and an axial gauge field ( @xmath37 ) : @xmath38 note that since both the momentum separation @xmath35 and @xmath39 couple to the axial current in the same way , we can always absorb @xmath19 into the axial gauge field .    for a wsm , even though the axial current is conserved at the classical level , it is well known that it exhibits a quantum axial anomaly : @xmath40 as a result , the leading effective coupling between the axial gauge field and external electromagnetic field is : @xmath41 this coupling is known to give rise to many interesting phenomena@xcite . first , if there is a momentum separation @xmath35 between two weyl cones at low energy , this acts like a background contribution to the axial gauge field , i.e. , @xmath42 , and the wsm exhibits a ( non - quantized ) anomalous hall effect .",
    "one heuristic way to understand this phenomenon is to treat the hamiltonian for each @xmath43 as a gapped 2d insulator ( except for the two nodal points ) .",
    "hence the theory is equivalent to many copies of a 2d massive dirac fermion ( i.e. , a chern insulator ) at each value of @xmath44 and each value of @xmath43 will have a quantized hall conductance .",
    "the @xmath43 values between the nodes contribute a value with a magnitude of @xmath45 while those outside the nodes contribute a vanishing amount .",
    "thus , in total we expect a finite hall conductance coming from the sum over all @xmath43 values between the nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "if we turn on an energy difference @xmath46 between the two weyl nodes , one naively expects a chiral magnetic effect due to the contribution : @xmath47      the anomalous hall effect and the chiral magnetic effect indicate time - reversal breaking responses in the plane perpendicular to the momentum separation between the weyl cones ( at least when there are only two nodes ) .",
    "these are both a consequence of the axial anomaly .",
    "usually a hall effect is accompanied by a hall viscosity@xcite and hence , one also expects a similar hall viscosity response associated to a stress - tensor anomaly in a weyl semimetal@xcite . indeed , even though the stress - energy tensor is conserved at the classical level",
    ", one can verify that there is an anomaly @xmath48where @xmath49 is a high - energy cut - off .",
    "thus , we see that the stress - energy tensor is anomalous , and the non - vanishing contribution implies a coupling between the axial gauge field ( including the momentum / energy differences in the weyl nodes ) and the frame field . as an aside we note that this is reminiscent of a mixed  @xmath50 \" term if we define the axial and  geometrical \" field - strengths as @xmath51 using these definitions , the stress anomaly can be expressed as : @xmath52 the physical interpretation of the anomaly is that if we have an axial magnetic flux @xmath53 , i.e. , an axion string , along the @xmath54-direction it will trap a chiral fermion , and hence a non - vanishing momentum density .",
    "subsequently , applying an @xmath55 ( e.g. , a time dependent strain / stretching ) will lead to an anomalous momentum current due to the geometric deformation of the chiral fermion states .",
    "there is an additional phenomena associated to this anomaly as well : if we have a screw dislocation along the @xmath54-direction with a burgers vector @xmath56 , then the application of an axial electric field will also drive an anomalous momentum current .",
    "unfortunately , it is not immediately clear how to relate this anomalous current to the perturbation of microscopic degrees of freedom localized on the dislocation .",
    "in addition to a stress anomaly there is an additional geometric contribution to the usual axial anomaly ( due to the nieh - yan term@xcite ) .",
    "if we consider the coupling between the axial gauge field and the frame fields , then the axial anomaly gains an additional term and should be modified as : @xmath57 the phenomena associated to the geometric contributions to this anomaly are discussed in detail in ref . .",
    "in an experimental context , we expect that these anomalies might play a role in the physics of wsms since a wsm has an effective background axial gauge field due to the momentum and energy separation of the weyl nodes . to calculate the effects of these anomalies for our simple wsm continuum model , we can couple our theory to a background geometry as before : @xmath58and then calculate the change in the path - integral measure during a chiral transformation .",
    "we can perform a chiral transformation to the weyl fermion : @xmath59 such that the momentum / energy separation proportional to @xmath60 in the effective action is eliminated in the lagrangian . however , the chiral transformation of the weyl fermion fields results in a change of the path integral measure which compensates for the missing term in the lagrangian . following the fujikawa method@xcite , the anomalous term from",
    "the path integral measure is @xmath61.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the response equations derived from the anomalous effective action represent the chiral magnetic effect , the anomalous hall effect , and the hall viscosity of the wsm , and they all depend on the momentum / energy separation of the nodes through @xmath62 we note in passing that the path integral measure change we derived here with respect to chiral transformations also applies to a massive dirac fermion , e.g. , the ai phase of a gapped wsm .    before moving to the next sectio ,",
    "n let us briefly look at the leading response to the background geometry .",
    "we find : @xmath63which was also studied in refs . .",
    "let us look at a particular contribution to this term where the first frame field factor @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ oddviscosity ] ) , from which we find @xmath65 leading into the next section where there is a fluctuating axion field , we see that this term hints at a coupling between axion strings / flux and lattice screw dislocations via a term of the form @xmath66 where @xmath34 contains the axion string configuration .",
    "as we will discuss in the next section , in the ai phase , one physical consequence of this term is to generate a kind of statistical interaction when an axion string is dragged around a lattice screw dislocation line .",
    "now let us consider the axion insulator phase generated from a wsm with cdw order . in this phase",
    "the weyl fermions have developed a mass from the weyl node nesting .",
    "let us consider a case where the mass term has a vortex / axion string configuration : @xmath67 note that in this section we will focus only on the phenomena associated to the axion string configuration , and not the background term coming from @xmath68 contributions from @xmath69 will enter the full response , but they will not be our focus for now , as some of them have been discussed perviously@xcite . after we perform a chiral transformation @xmath70 , we can remove phase of the axial mass by introducing the axial gauge field configuration @xmath20 ( c.f .",
    "[ eq : bfromvortex ] ) coupled with the axial current .",
    "hence , we have the lagrangian @xmath71    beyond the change in the lagrangian , the chiral transformation will also change the path integral measure .",
    "thus , the effective theory describing the interplay between the cdw axion string defect and the lattice dislocation defect consists of two parts : ( i ) @xmath72 is the action we obtain from integrating out the gapped fermions , and ( ii ) @xmath73 is the action coming from the contribution of the path integral measure . by integrating out the fermions in the lagrangian in eq .",
    "[ eq : lagrangianaib ] and performing the loop expansion to quadratic order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ebloop ] ) , we first find :    [ h ! ]        @xmath74    the chiral transformation we made generates an extra term from path integral measure given by@xcite , @xmath75 thus , the total effective theory is the sum of these two terms : @xmath76    if we do not specify a restricted geometry ( i.e. , not just a @xmath25-oriented screw dislocation ) and allow for the full geometric coupling , then we would find every possible permutation @xmath77 .",
    "this combination of indices is unusual as it only allows  off - diagonal \" contributions of the frame fields such as those generated by screw dislocations ( but not edge dislocations ) .",
    "this is unusual since it is not only sensitive to the burgers vector , but a geometric characteristic of the lattice dislocation , i.e. , whether it is edge or screw .",
    "one interpretation of this term is that it generates a statistical interaction between an axion string ( i.e. , the cdw dislocation ) and a geometric screw dislocation of the underlying lattice .",
    "we will illustrate this statement in two ways .",
    "we begin by setting up an axion string and a screw - dislocation as straight lines parallel to the @xmath25-direction .",
    "we can fix this orientation of the two strings and braid them by moving them in the @xmath78-plane .",
    "we will see that this will give a berry phase proportional to the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ vortex_dislocation ] ) . since the dislocation couples to the stress tensor , and the momentum currents are not quantized objects ( at least for our considerations )",
    ", the berry phase here can be any irrational number .",
    "also , since crystal dislocations are not deconfined excitations , there will naturally be other , highly non - universal , contributions to the total phase during this process .    [ h ! ] .",
    "the dark green line is the axion string parallel to dislocation line .",
    "the light green cylinder side surface is the trajectory of the axion string.,title=\"fig:\",width=240,height=230 ]    as the axion string / dislocation lines are in the @xmath25-direction , we can treat them as an independent collection of points that braid around each other in the @xmath78-plane . hence , the berry phase term accumulated by the winding of the screw dislocation around the axion string can be obtained by generating the analogous hopf term .",
    "we rewrite the action as , @xmath79 \\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\int d^4 x \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\left[-\\frac{a^{b}_\\rho \\partial_{\\mu } a^{e}_{\\nu } \\epsilon^{\\rho \\mu \\nu } } { 2\\pi m^2 \\ln(\\lambda / m ) } + j^{b}_{\\nu } a^{b}_{\\nu } + \\mathcal{b}_z j^{e}_{\\nu } a^{e}_{\\nu}\\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & j^{b}_{\\nu}\\equiv\\epsilon^{\\rho \\mu \\nu }   \\partial_{\\mu } b_\\rho/2\\pi,~   j^{e}_{\\nu}\\equiv\\frac{\\epsilon^{\\rho \\mu \\nu}}{2\\pi \\mathcal{b}_z }   \\partial_{\\mu } e^{z}_\\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced auxiliary gauge fields @xmath80 and @xmath81 to decouple the mixed term , and @xmath82 are the currents of the axion string and screw dislocation line , respectively , both of which are aligned in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "we have treated the string currents as point - particle currents for simplicity since the strings are straight lines .",
    "we have also normalized the screw dislocation current with a factor of its burgers vector @xmath83 in order to have a quantized screw dislocation flux .",
    "now that we have this form , we can integrate out the two auxiliary gauge fields of @xmath81 and @xmath80 to obtain a hopf term , @xmath84 the hopf term evaluates to the linking number between the worldlines of each point on the two strings since they are straight - lines oriented in the @xmath25-direction .",
    "an effective world - line linking occurs in the @xmath85-@xmath86-@xmath87 spacetime and we have a ( non - universal ) statistical phase : @xmath88    using the same axion string and dislocation arrangement , we can provide a more microscopic argument for this statistical interaction between the axion string and the crystal dislocation line as well .",
    "the axion string carries a localized 1d chiral fermion propagating along the z - direction@xcite .",
    "we can label each low energy mode of the chiral fermion with their momentum in the @xmath25-direction @xmath43 .",
    "the modes remain localized on the string until they reach an energy corresponding to the bulk gap which acts as a cutoff ; states beyond this energy are not localized on the string , and are not chiral . during the string braiding process , each chiral 1d @xmath43 mode traveling around the screw dislocation line will pick up a phase since the axion string is translated by the burgers vector of the dislocation .",
    "each value of @xmath43 sees an effective momentum - dependent magnetic flux and picks up an aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "the total phase can be calculated from a sum over all the localized chiral states : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the burgers vector of the screw - dislocation . for a system with length @xmath91 in the @xmath25-direction , and with periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "the @xmath43 are discretized to multiples of @xmath92 . since for conventional models",
    "the chiral modes lie inside the bulk gap , the total number of chiral states inside the gap is @xmath93 ( recall we have set the fermi - velocity / speed of light to unity ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 ( up to a piece which is negligible as @xmath95 ) .",
    "the accumulated berry phase is therefore @xmath96 this matches our hopf result up to a log correction factor .",
    "apart from the mutual statistical interaction between the axion string and lattice dislocations , there is also a set of three loop statistical interactions that we can study in the axion insulator phase .",
    "first , there is a statistical interaction between two external electromagnetic flux loops threaded by an axion string . to see this we recall that the triangle diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : axialanomalydiag ] ) gives rise to an anomalous contribution to the conservation law for the axial current :    [ h ! ]",
    "@xmath97    the first term on the right hand side comes from the explicit breaking of the axial / chiral symmetry at the classical level due to the non - vanishing dirac mass , while the second term is the anomaly term from the triangle diagram . in the long wavelength limit",

    "in our discussions so far we have focused primarily on geometric response phenomena and statistical interactions between axion strings and lattice dislocations . however , in this section we provide two possible routes to an electromagnetic response property .",
    "the first one is due to the cross - coupling between the external electromagnetic field and the geometrical distortions in a gapless wsm phase , while the other is due to the fluctuations of the cdw order responsible for gapping a wsm to form the axion insulator . for the former response",

    "hence a dislocation density will also produce such an effect in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "for the latter response , we will argue that the usual electromagnetic response of a wsm can survive into the gapped phase because of the space - time dependence of the cdw order parameter .",
    "we finish this section with a discussion of some analogous geometric effects including a hall viscosity response of the axion insulator phase , a chiral geometric effect , and a geometric witten effect .",
    "let us start with a phenomenon in the gapless wsm .",
    "the effect of interest is the result of a mixed coupling between electromagnetic and geometric fields , and is effectively a dislocation - induced chiral magnetic effect . in a wsm ,",
    "an axial chemical potential ( relative energy shift of the nodes ) would result in a cme where a non - vanishing magnetic flux in the @xmath54-direction leads to charge current in the @xmath54-direction via the effective response action : @xmath109 we have already seen that in an axion insulator the screw dislocation density couples with the axion gauge potential @xmath108 ( see eq .",
    "[ vortex_dislocation ] ) .",
    "if we generate a non - vanishing dislocation density , we then expect an effective axial potential will be generated , and a similar chiral magnetic effect will be produced .    to explicitly demonstrate this effect we calculate the triangle diagram in fig .",

    "interestingly , this is also one of the few geometric terms where the coefficient is independent of the high - energy cutoff .",

    "let us assume translation invariance in the @xmath25-direction and fix the momentum @xmath120 in addition to the external magnetic field @xmath112 , assume a uniform dislocation density ( for simplicity ) with burgers vector @xmath121 this acts as an effective magnetic flux in the @xmath25-direction , but couples to momentum charge as @xmath122 at the fixed value of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , for each @xmath43 , we have landau levels with degeneracy @xmath123 . in the zeroth landau level",
    ", there exists a gapless chiral mode lying inside the landau level gap @xmath124 ( where we have set the fermi velocity equal to unity ) .",
    "the induced current density is @xmath125 which agrees with our effective theory .",
    "now let us discuss the second effect mentioned above by describing the electromagnetic response of the axion insulator due to the fluctuating axion field .",
    "the axion insulator phase is gapped since the weyl nodes are eliminated by the cdw order .",
    "thus , there is naively no expectation that anything like an anomalous hall effect or chiral magnetic effect should persist in the insulator phase ; especially since the usual definition of @xmath60 is no longer well - defined without weyl nodes in the band structure .",
    "however , as the mass term of the insulator is generated by the cdw order parameter with wave vector @xmath11 , the mass is actually spatially dependent @xmath126 and _ remembers _ the nodal configuration of the weyl nodes from the parent wsm state .",
    "when the cdw order is free of string defects , we have @xmath127 and the theory in eq . [ axionbraiding ]",
    "then becomes , @xmath128 this describes the response in the axion insulator phase , and it is similar to the usual anomalous hall effect / chiral magnetic effect response for a weyl semimetal .",
    "however , the responses in the axion insulator arise from the space and time dependence of the cdw order parameter , not from the momentum and energy separation of gapless weyl cones .",
    "interestingly , if the weyl nodes were separated in energy , the cdw would have to have a built - in time dependence to precisely nest the energy - separated nodes , and this would leave some memory of the chiral magnetic response .",
    "thus , once a weyl semimetal is gapped to form an axion insulator , a time dependent cdw order parameter can generate the cme , and spatial dependence will produce an anomalous hall effect .",
    "therefore , we also expect there to be an anomalous hall effect and cme in the axion insulator , with the same coefficient as in the parent , gapless wsm phase .      in the axion insulator phase we recall the effective action showing the coupling between axion strings and crystal dislocations from eq .",
    "( [ threeloop ] ) : @xmath129 hence , the geometric version of the anomalous hall effect exists if we have a spatial - dependent cdw order parameter @xmath130 which produces the term in the stress response @xmath131 here @xmath132 run over @xmath133 .",
    "this term represents the hall viscosity in 3d where a shear deformation would result in a momentum current perpendicular to the strain rate .",
    "since a generic axion insulator naturally has a spatially - dependent order parameter ( due to the @xmath134 background contribution to the axion field ) this result implies that they will generically have a hall viscosity .",
    "furthermore , if we have a time - dependent cdw order parameter @xmath135 , we expect a geometric version of the chiral magnetic effect , @xmath136 which implies that if we have a finite dislocation density @xmath137 in the @xmath138-plane ( with burgers vector in the @xmath139-direction ) , we would obtain a momentum current response @xmath140 in the direction perpendicular to the @xmath138-plane with momentum pointing in the @xmath139-direction",
    ".    finally , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ threeloop ] ) as @xmath141assuming the cdw order induces a mass @xmath142 and @xmath2 is the phase angle of the cdw order parameter .",
    "this term is in analogy with the electromagnetic theta term @xmath143 that also appears in an axion insulator .",
    "it is known that the usual electromagnetic theta term gives rise to the witten effect , so let us consider an analogous effect from eq .",
    "[ eq : geomthetaterm ] .",
    "the stress - energy tensor receives one contribution of the form @xmath144from this term in the effective action .",
    "akin to the magnetic monopole configuration of the electromagnetic field , we can use @xmath145 as a definition of a geometric monopole @xmath146 carrying dislocation / burgers vector flux as discussed above .",
    "in analogy to the conventional witten effect in an axion insulator , where a magnetic charge binds electric charge , in this case a momentum density @xmath147 is bound to a dislocation monopole charge @xmath148 and a momentum current carries a dislocation monopole current .",
    "hence , this is a purely geometric witten effect .",
    "in summary , we have explored the properties of weyl semimetals and axion insulators coupled to geometry . the novel interplay between axion strings and lattice dislocation defects",
    "were studied through both the effective field theory and the microscopic arguments .    unlike in a time - reversal invariant topological insulator ,",
    "the axion field in an axion insulator is dynamical and can generate string / vortex defects in configurations of the cdw order parameter .",
    "the linear coupling between the axion string and the lattice geometry induces a statistical interaction between the axion strings and screw dislocation lines .",
    "the cubic coupling between the axion string and geometry fields is a signature of a three - loop statistical interaction between two dislocation loops penetrated by an axion string .",
    "in addition , we also derived an effective response for a chiral magnetic effect induced by screw dislocation density instead of an axial chemical potential , i.e. , an energy imbalance between weyl cones .",
    "this provides another possible way to measure a nontrivial electromagnetic response in weyl semi - metals .",
    "we also presented several purely geometric response effects that might also be measured in future experiments .",
