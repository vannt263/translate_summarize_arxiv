    "<S> introduction_. andreev reflection ( ar ) plays a central role in the charge transmission at the interface between a normal conductor ( n ) and a superconductor ( s )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of the process is its spin dependence . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , near the interface , an electron with a certain spin injected from n is retro - reflected as a hole of the opposite spin via a conventional local andreev reflection ( lar ) . in situations where the spin flip is allowed at the interface , </S>",
    "<S> equal - spin ar can occur , where both the electron and the hole have the same spin  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been shown that equal - spin ar can also be induced by the majorana bound state ( mbs ) residing on the edge of a semi - infinite topological superconducting nanowire with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , zeeman splitting and proximity - induced superconductivity  @xcite . as the equal - spin ar therein originates from the self - hermitian nature of mbss </S>",
    "<S> , the spin dependence of the ar is bound to be affected in finite - size systems , where overlap coupling between mbss on different edges invalidates the self - hermitian property .     </S>",
    "<S> +    more generally , for a finite - length nanowire with soc , zeeman splitting and proximity - induced superconductivity , pairs of nondegenerate discrete states appear in the energy spectrum  @xcite . in a finite - size topological superconducting wire , the lowest discrete states , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. the pair of states closest to the fermi surface , correspond to the in - gap states induced by the hybridization of mbss on the edges . while in a topologically trivial wire with finite length , the lowest discrete states correspond to the gap - edge states . in this work , we show that carriers involved in a resonant ar with the lowest discrete states can have noncollinear spin orientations , in contrast to the conventional and the equal - spin ar .    in a noncollinear lar , the spin polarizations of the injected and the retro - reflected carriers are typically at an angle which is tunable via system parameters . </S>",
    "<S> hence , lar can be suppressed by tuning the alignment of the magnetic moment of the half metal ( hm ) lead placed at one end of the wire . </S>",
    "<S> the noncollinear ar is intimately connected to the local spin orientations of the lowest discrete states at the edge , which are tunable via the zeeman splitting , the soc and the wire length . under appropriate parameters , the conventional or the equal - spin ar </S>",
    "<S> can be recovered as limiting cases of the more general noncollinear ar , which is particularly important under realistic experimental conditions of finite - size nanowires .    </S>",
    "<S> this noncollinearity is particularly important for nonlocal transport processes where the wire length is typically comparable to the superconducting coherence length  @xcite . in general , </S>",
    "<S> when an electron is injected from one n lead to the s , it can either form a cooper pair in the s and leave an out - going hole in the other n lead ; or it can propagate through the s to the other lead . </S>",
    "<S> these two different processes respectively correspond to the cross andreev reflection ( car )  @xcite and the direct charge transfer  @xcite , which can be differentiated and respectively blocked in a noncollinear nonlocal transport . </S>",
    "<S> a paradigm scenario here is by placing two hm leads in contact with the wire ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) . depending on whether the fermi levels of the two leads are aligned with the same ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) or different ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) discrete states , either a car or a direct charge transfer can take place . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by adjusting the polarizations of the hm leads , these noncollinear nonlocal transport processes can be respectively blocked based on the different spin polarizations of carriers in the microscopic transport channels ( fig .  </S>",
