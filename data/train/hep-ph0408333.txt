    "phenomenologically the bke provides a good description of dis data from hera  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the linear part of the bke is obtained in the leading soft gluon emission approximation keeping the strong coupling fixed and that the large @xmath26 limit is used in order to write the nonlinear term as a product of two functions @xmath27 .",
    "this limit is at the basis of the color dipole picture and , to a large extent , it corresponds to a mean field theory without dipole correlations .",

    "triantafyllopoulos  @xcite has considered the renormalisation group improved nlo bfkl equation with the presence of a saturation boundary .",
    "his results show a decrease in the saturation scale growth as a function of rapidity towards the value @xmath32 observed experimentally .",
    "a similar type of study based on the nlo bfkl has been recently reported in  @xcite .    in this work",

    "we will introduce a constraint in the rapidity of the emitted gluons in the bke , a so  called `` rapidity veto ''  @xcite which , for the linear part of the equation , is known to reproduce the bulk of the nlo corrections . in the next section",
    "we revise how to introduce a veto in rapidity in the linear bfkl equation and apply this constraint to obtain an estimate of the saturation scale as a function of the veto . in section  [ nnbke ]",

    "we can now introduce this in the original equation to obtain @xmath39 therefore the effect of imposing the veto on the lo bfkl equation leads to an eigenvalue which is determined by the solution to @xmath40 it is worth noting that the solution to this equation respects the structure of a maximum at @xmath41 for @xmath42 so that this region dominates at high energies .",
    "this is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ vetolo ] where the maxima are shown revealing how the original value of the pomeron intercept decreases from about 0.5 to about 0.3 for a value of the veto of two units of rapidity .",

    "we will see that the power growth of the saturation scale is slower , even for zero veto , mainly due to preasymptotic effects .",

    ".    in the context of the bke the imposition of the veto has the consequence of a small fluctuation above @xmath76 when the function approaches the unitarity bound .",
    "these small fluctuations do not grow with rapidity .",
    "technically this small violation of unitarity has its origin in the fact that the evolution is not stopped at @xmath77 since the derivative is computed at a retarded rapidity @xmath78 , see eq .",
    "( [ bkedifveto ] ) .",
    "this small instability is not surprising since our approach is only an estimate of the nlo corrections . to fully preserve unitarity",
    "possibly we would have to introduce a correlation between coordinates and rapidity .",
    "connecting with this point it is worth noticing that a generalization of the bke proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and amounting to having extra @xmath79 factor in front of the evolution kernel would respect unitarity even in the presence of a rapidity veto . in order to study the behavior of the saturation scale",

    "( [ bkedifveto ] ) will be solved numerically for @xmath81 , which corresponds to rapidities above @xmath82 . with this goal in mind",
    "we need to specify the initial conditions to the non  linear equation which , in principle , should be fitted to experimental data . motivated by the phenomenological accuracy of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same initial conditions as those in that reference are used in the present work .",
    "these conditions were fitted to low @xmath83 data for the bke with no veto and read @xmath84 here @xmath28 is taken to be lo running at the scale @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the lo cteq6 gluon distribution also computed at the scale @xmath85 .",

    "@xcite and implemented in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 stands for the effective proton size , @xmath89 , an output of the fit performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the numerical implementation of the veto it is necessary to generate the initial conditions in a band of width @xmath33 between @xmath71 and @xmath90 .",
    "the reason for this becomes clear if we think the evolution in rapidity @xmath91 as a process in which @xmath92 is the input for the next step which will give us @xmath93 . in the non zero veto case in order to compute @xmath93 one would need to consider @xmath94 .",
    "hence , since we start at @xmath71 we need a band of initial conditions that will span the space between @xmath95 and @xmath71 . as there is no evolution in energy along that band",
    "we assume the initial conditions to be independent of @xmath91 and equal to @xmath96 on the band .    in fig .",
    "[ 4 ] the first result for the solution to the bke is shown .",
    "there it can be seen how the amplitude @xmath27 starts at zero for small transverse distances @xmath97 ( color transparency ) to reach the saturation regime @xmath98 at @xmath97 about 4 @xmath99 .",
    "this trend is general for all values of the rapidity veto but , as a new feature , we observe how the arrival of the saturation of the amplitude is delayed as the veto increases .",

    "the effect of the veto is more dramatic , considerably delaying the onset of saturation .",
    "the major effect of the rapidity constraint comes when studying how the bk amplitude evolves with energy . as the intercept in the linear part is significantly reduced when higher order corrections are taken into account the saturation of the amplitude comes also later in rapidities . to illustrate this point we plot fig .

    "the numerical results when we introduce the veto on the bke are consistent with those obtained from a more analytical approach in sec .",

    "can only be done by modeling . in previous analysis introducing running",
    "seems to be phenomenologically favored by the data  @xcite .",
    "this is because the effect of running @xmath28 is to bring @xmath3 down to about 0.3 in the phenomenologically relevant region of @xmath111 .",
    "the main concern of this section is to study the stability of this value of @xmath112 when the veto is imposed on top of the running .",

    "what about the energy dependence of the saturation scale ?",
    "the answer to this question is plotted in fig .  [",
    "10 ] where the saturation scale is shown as a function of rapidity .",
    "the usual delay of the onset of saturation can be again observed although the effect of the estimated higher order corrections is smaller than for the case of fixed coupling in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] .    to make this more explicit we calculate the dependence of the @xmath3 power in eq .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) ) .",
    "the main conclusion is that the effect of the veto is not so big in the running coupling case , taking @xmath3 from @xmath115 for @xmath66 to about 0.27 for @xmath68 .",
    "this variation is much smaller than for the fixed coupling case .",
    "the calculations in this section teach us that once the coupling is allowed to run the influence of other higher order corrections is diminished .",
    "the prediction for the growth of the saturation scale with energy remains of the order of @xmath112 for phenomenological energies independently of the rapidity veto .    as a final remark ,",
    "we have checked that the solutions to the bke for both fixed and running @xmath28 cases exhibit the geometrical scaling property @xcite .",
    "namely , the amplitude @xmath116 is a function of the product @xmath117 , that is @xmath118 .",
    "scaling holds in the saturation domain @xmath119 and extends to a much broader region @xmath120 . for the bke with @xmath121 scaling",
    "was shown in refs .",
    "we have found that the scaling is still present after introducing a non - zero veto , suggesting the full nlo amplitude to be also a scaling function .",
    "in this work higher order corrections to the balitsky  kovchegov equation have been estimated .",
    "this estimate has been based on the introduction of a so  called `` rapidity veto '' , which forbids two emissions to be very close in rapidity .",
    "it is known from ref .",
    "@xcite that the introduction of a veto , @xmath33 , of @xmath122 units of rapidity mimics the pomeron intercept predicted by other resummations of the nlo bfkl equation .",
    "we have estimated these higher order corrections first using analytical arguments imposing the rapidity veto on the lo bfkl equation obtaining a power growth of the saturation scale of @xmath69 , for @xmath58 , consistent with that calculated in ref .",

    "we have then pursued a numerical analysis of the introduction of the rapidity constraint in the full balitsky  kovchegov equation for phenomenological rapidities , without using asymptotic arguments .",
    "for a fixed coupling constant of 0.2 we observe that the power @xmath3 decreases from @xmath123 for zero veto to @xmath110 for @xmath68 , with a dependence on the veto very similar to the previous analytical study , the main result plotted in fig .  [",

    "<S> higher order corrections to the balitsky  kovchegov equation have been estimated by introducing a rapidity veto which forbids subsequent emissions to be very close in rapidity and is known to mimic higher order corrections to the linear bfkl equation . </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity veto constraint has been first introduced using analytical arguments obtaining a power growth with energy , @xmath0 , of the saturation scale of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> then a numerical analysis for the non  linear balitsky  kovchegov equation has been carried out for phenomenological rapidities : when a veto of about two units of rapidity is introduced for a fixed value of the coupling constant of @xmath2 the saturation scale @xmath3 decreases from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and when running coupling effects are taken into account it decreases from @xmath6 to @xmath5 .    </S>",
