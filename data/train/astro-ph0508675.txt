    "high energy neutrinos are likely produced in many violent processes in the universe .",
    "their detection would unambiguously reveal the hadronic nature of the underlying processes .",
    "neutrinos would be generated by proton - proton or proton - photon interactions followed by production and decay of charged mesons .",
    "one detection mode of neutrino telescopes is the identification of individual , point - like sources of high energy neutrinos .",
    "galactic candidates for these objects include supernova remnants or microquasars , extragalactic objects are e.g. active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "individual sources might be too weak to produce an unambiguous directional signal , however the integrated neutrino flux from all sources could produce a detectable diffuse neutrino signal .",
    "astrophysical neutrinos generated in top - down models are , by definition , of diffuse nature .",
    "a diffuse neutrino flux can be identified by a high - energy excess on top of the background of known fluxes of charged particles recorded by a neutrino telescope .",
    "such charged particles are dominantly muons produced in the atmosphere above the detector , with a small contribution from muons generated in interactions of atmospheric neutrinos .    in this paper we present results of a search for neutrinos with energies larger than 10 tev .",
    "the analysis is based on data taken with the baikal neutrino telescope _",
    "_ between april 1998 and february 2003 . instead of focusing to high - energy particles crossing the array , the analysis is tailored to signatures of isolated high - energy cascades in a large volume around the detector @xcite .",
    "this search strategy dramatically enhances the sensitivity of _",
    "nt200 _ to diffuse high energy processes .    the cascades can stem from leptons and hadrons produced in high energy charged current processes @xmath10 or from the hadronic vertex of neutral current processes @xmath11 where @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "the energy released by the hadronic cascade in reaction ( 2 ) is small compared to that of the leptonic cascades in ( 1 ) .",
    "since only electrons and taus develop cascades ( electrons by directly showering up , taus via their decay to secondary particles which develop a cascade ) , the sensitivity of this search is dominated by @xmath14 and @xmath15 detection .",
    "cascades can also be produced by resonant w production @xmath16 with the resonant neutrino energy @xmath17gev and cross section @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe detector and site , and illustrate the detector performance . in section 3",
    "we first line out the search strategy .",
    "this is followed by a description of how a laser light source mimicking high energy cascades is used to investigate the detector performance with respect to energetic cascades .",
    "furthermore , we describe the simulation of signal and background processes .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the experimental data .",
    "limits on high energy neutrino fluxes and comparison to models are presented in section 5 .",
    "section 6 gives conclusions and a short outlook on how to further improve the present limits .",
    "the baikal neutrino telescope is operated in lake baikal , siberia , at a depth of . the present stage of the telescope ,",
    "_ nt200 _ @xcite , takes data since april 6th , 1998 and consists of 192 optical modules ( oms ) . a schematic view of the baikal telescope _",

    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "an umbrella - like frame carries 8 strings , each with 24 pairwise arranged oms .",
    "all oms face downward , with the exception of the second and eleventh pairs on each string which face upward .",
    "three underwater electrical cables connect the detector with the shore station .",
    "each om contains a 37-cm diameter _",
    "- photo multiplier ( pm ) , which has been developed specially for our project @xcite .",
    "the pms record the cherenkov light produced by charged particles in water .",
    "the two pms of a pair are switched in coincidence in order to suppress background from bioluminescence and pm noise .",
    "a pair of oms defines a _",
    "channel_. the light arrival time assigned to a channel is the response time of the om with the earliest hit .",
    "the amplitude assigned to a channel is that recorded by one pre - selected pm of the two pms in a pair . for those channels for which one of the two oms failed and the single pm noise rates of the remaining om are not too high ( smaller than the average noise rate of 100 khz ) , that om is operated in single mode ( 1pm / channel ) , with a threshold slightly higher than the typical 0.3 photo electrons .",
    "a _ trigger _ is formed by the requirement of ( with _ hit _ referring to a channel ) within .",
    "@xmath20 is typically set to for these events , amplitude and time of all fired channels are digitized and sent to shore .",
    "+    two nitrogen lasers are used for calibration of the detector .",
    "the first one ( _ fiber laser _ ) is mounted just above the array .",
    "its light is guided via optical fibers of equal length to each om pair .",
    "the fiber laser provides the oms with simultaneous light signals in order to determine the offset for each channel .",
    "the second laser ( _ water laser _ ) is arranged 20 m below the array .",
    "its light propagates through the water .",
    "this laser serves to monitor the water quality , in addition to dedicated environmental devices located along a separate string . in the context of this analysis ,",
    "however , its main purpose is to simulate high energy particle cascades outside the geometrical volume of _ nt200_. the maximum light intensity of the water laser ( @xmath2110@xmath22 photons / pulse ) roughly corresponds to the cherenkov radiation emitted by high - energy cascades with @xmath231 pev .",
    "a full cycle of detector calibration running both lasers over a wide range of intensities is repeated every third day .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates the level to which basic features of the detector are understood and can be reproduced by monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "we have used atmospheric muons as a high statistics standard calibration signal .",
    "the figure shows distributions of recorded amplitudes and light arrival time differences compared to mc - simulation .",
    "the experimental data are in good agreement with simulation ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "the baikal survey for high energy neutrinos searches for bright cascades produced at the neutrino interaction vertex in a large volume around and below the neutrino telescope ( see fig .",

    "we select events with high multiplicity of hit channels @xmath30 , corresponding to bright cascades .",
    "the main remaining background to isolated cascades from neutrino interactions are then cascades from bremsstrahlung along energetic downward muons . to separate high - energy neutrino events from background events a cut on the variable @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) is applied .        here",
    ", @xmath33 are the arrival times at channels @xmath34 on each string ( the numbering of channels is from top to bottom along strings ) , the minimum over all strings is calculated . positive and negative values of @xmath35 correspond to upward and downward propagation of light , respectively .",
    "we require @xmath36 this cut accepts only time patterns corresponding to upward traveling light signals .",
    "it rejects most events from brems - cascades produced by downward going muons since the majority of muons is close to the vertical ; they would cross the detector or pass nearby and generate a downward time pattern . only few muons with large zenith angles",
    "may escape this cut and illuminate the array by their own cherenkov radiation or that from bright cascades from below .",
    "the energy spectrum of neutrinos from galactic and cosmological sources or from the decay of topological defects is expected to have a significantly flatter shape than the spectrum of atmospheric muons .",
    "this is reflected by different @xmath30 distributions . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show @xmath30 distributions of simulated events which survive cut ( [ eq1 ] ) and would be induced by electron neutrinos with fluxes of shape @xmath37 , with ( normalized to each other , simulations is for 80 operating channels ) .",
