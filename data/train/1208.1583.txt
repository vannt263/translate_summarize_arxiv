    "until the middle of 1980 s , nuclear physics had been developed by investigating primarily stable nuclei which exist in nature .",
    "many facets of atomic nuclei had been revealed , which include a mass , density distribution , radius , shell structure , collective excitations , and various decay modes@xcite . as a natural question ,",
    "however , it had been discussed already in the late 1960 s a question on how many neutrons can be bound for a given number of proton@xcite . the first international symposium on nuclei",
    "far from the stability line was held in 1966 at lysekil , sweden@xcite , followed by the succeeding conference held in 1970 at cern@xcite .",
    "the questions which attracted nuclear physicists at that time include i ) where is the neutron drip line ?",
    "ii ) do the nuclear models which were successful for stable nuclei work also for neutron - rich nuclei ? and iii ) the relevance to the r - process nucleosynthesis@xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that already in 1966 the @xmath3he nucleus was predicted to be stable by about 10 mev against a dissociation to @xmath4he + 2n@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0li nucleus was also predicted to be slightly unbound , that is , only by 0.6 mev , with respect to the @xmath5li+2n configuration @xcite .",
    "the real start of the field of neutron - rich nuclei , however , was much later , that is , only in 1985 , when an anomalously large matter radius of the @xmath0li nucleus was experimentally discovered through the measurement of the interaction cross section @xcite .",
    "the matter radius was found to deviate largely from the known systematics in stable nuclei , which scales as @xmath6 as a function of mass number @xmath7 of a nucleus ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . together with a fact that the two - neutron separation energy , @xmath8 , is extremely small for this nucleus ( @xmath8 was known to be 190@xmath9 110 kev at the time of 1985 @xcite , which has been updated to 378@xmath95 kev@xcite ) ,",
    "the large matter radius has been interpreted to be due to a long tail of the wave function for the weakly bound valence nucleons.@xcite .",
    "this structure is referred to as _ halo _",
    ", in which the density distribution of valence neutron(s ) largely extends over the core nucleus . since the proton and neutron density distributions are almost the same in stable nuclei , the discovery of the halo structure was a big surprise .",
    "subsequently , the interpretation of the halo structure was supported also by the observed narrow momentum distribution of the @xmath5li nucleus due to the breakup of @xmath0li @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized by now that this exotic structure is an important characteristic feature of neutron - rich nuclei , and it has attracted much attention .",
    "the physics of neutron - rich nuclei has now been one of the main current subjects of nuclear physics .",
    "in fact , new generation ri beam facilities ( such as ribf at riken in japan@xcite , fair at gsi in germany@xcite , spiral2 at ganil in france@xcite , and frib at msu in the usa@xcite ) have been , or will soon be , in operation in the world wide . in this chapter , we summarize the developments of the physics of unstable nuclei in the past few decades . in sec .",
    "ii , we first discuss properties of one - neutron halo nuclei , that is , nuclei with a tightly bound core nucleus and a loosely bound valence neutron .",
    "we particularly discuss the role of single - particle angular momentum and the coulomb dissociation . in sec .",
    "iii , we treat two - neutron halo nuclei . the main focus will be put on the correlation between the valence neutrons . as possible probes for the correlation",
    ", we discuss the coulomb breakup , the two - nucleon radioactivity , and the two - neutron transfer reactions . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider heavier neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the topics to be discussed include the matter radii and the neutron skin thickness , the odd - even staggering of interaction cross sections , alpha clustering , the shell evolution and the deformation , and the collective excitations such as the pygmy dipole resonances . finally , we summarize the chapter in sec",
    ". v.    as the physics of neutron - rich nuclei is diverse , it is almost impossible to cover all the topics in this chapter .",
    "we would like the readers to refer also to review articles @xcite , and references therein .",
    "we first discuss properties of one - neutron halo nuclei , for which a weakly - bound valence neutron moves around a core nucleus .",
    "a typical example is @xmath0be , for which the interaction cross section has been found considerably large @xcite , similar to the @xmath0li nucleus .",
    "the one neutron separation energy , @xmath10 , is as small as 504@xmath9 6 kev @xcite , which can be compared to the one neutron separation energy of _",
    "@xmath11c nucleus , @xmath10=4.95 mev .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0be nucleus takes a halo structure .",
    "in fact , the large interaction cross section is consistent with a density distribution with a long tail , as has been shown in ref .",
    "( see fig .",
    "it is instructive to consider a simple two - body model with a core nucleus plus a valence neutron in order to understand the halo phenomenon .",
    "that is , we solve the schrdinger equation , @xmath12 u_l(r)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the nucleon mass , @xmath14 is the single - particle angular momentum , and @xmath15 is a spherical single - particle potential . fig .",
    "3 shows the radial wave function @xmath16 on the linear ( the upper panel ) and the logarithmic ( the lower panel ) scales for the @xmath0be nucleus with the two - body @xmath17be+@xmath18 model .",
    "we use a woods - saxon potential for @xmath15 with the radius and the diffuseness parameters of @xmath19=2.74 fm and @xmath20=0.75 fm , respectively , whereas the depth parameter is adjusted for each angular momentum @xmath14 so that the single - particle energy @xmath21 is @xmath220.5 mev . for simplicity , we do not consider a spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the solid , the dashed , and the dotted lines show the wave functions for the 2@xmath23 , 1@xmath24 , and 1@xmath25 states , respectively .",
    "one can clearly see that the wave function for the 2@xmath23 state is largely extended , while that for the 1@xmath25 state is spatially rather compact .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) radii are 7.17 , 5.17 , and 4.15 fm for the 2@xmath23 , 1@xmath24 , and 1@xmath25 states , respectively .",
    "4 shows the rms radii as a function of the single - particle energy .",
    "as one can show analytically@xcite , the rms radius diverges for @xmath14 = 0 and 1 ( it behaves as @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 ) , while it converges to a constant value for higher values of @xmath14 in the limit of zero binding energy .",
    "the halo structure , therefore , has been ascribed to an occupation of a weakly - bound @xmath30 or @xmath31 orbit by a valence nucleon near the threshold@xcite .",
    "the halo structure significantly affects the dissociation process of a one - neutron halo nucleus in an external coulomb field .",
    "the photoabsorption cross section for a dipole photon is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the photon energy and @xmath34 is the reduced transition probability ( see _ e.g. , _ appendix b of ref . ) .",
    "here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the wave functions for the initial and the final states , respectively , @xmath37 being the angular momentum for the initial state @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath38 is the e1 effective charge , which is given by @xmath39 for a two - body system with a @xmath40 configuration .",
    "a characteristic feature of the dipole excitation is that the @xmath41(e1 ) distribution , @xmath42 , has a strong peak in the low energy region when the binding energy is small ( that is , the soft e1 mode@xcite ) .",
    "this large concentration of the e1 strength near the continuum threshold is caused by the optimal matching of wave functions between a weakly bound and continuum states . for a transition from an @xmath23-wave state to a @xmath24-wave state , the @xmath41(e1 )",
    "distribution can be evaluated analytically as @xmath43 if one employs a yukawa function for @xmath35 and a spherical bessel function for the radial part of @xmath36 @xcite ( see refs . and for a general expression with arbitrary initial and final angular momenta ) . here",
    ", @xmath44 is the reduced mass between the two fragments , @xmath45 is the energy of the initial bound state , and @xmath46 is the energy of the final bound state , that is , the photon energy is @xmath47 .",
    "this equation indicates that the peak energy appears at @xmath48 with the height of the peak being proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "the total strength is given by @xmath50 therefore , the peak position moves towards low energy as the binding energy , @xmath51 , decreases , and at the same time the height of the peak increases , leading also to the increase of the total e1 strength .",
    "these features can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "5 , which shows the @xmath41(e1 ) distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ e1analytic ] ) for two different binding energies .",
    "notice that using eq .",
    "( [ be1 ] ) it is easy to derive that the total e1 strength ( that is , the non - energy weighted sum rule ) is proportional to the expectation value of @xmath52 with respect to the ground state , @xmath53 as we mention in the previous subsection , the rms radius diverges in the zero binding limit for @xmath14=0 and 1 states , leading therefore to a divergence of the total e1 strength .",
    "thus , an observation of a large e1 strength makes a clear indication of a halo structure of the nucleus .",
    "experimentally , the coulomb dissociation of halo nuclei has been studied by coulomb excitation experiments with a heavy target nucleus , such as @xmath54pb @xcite .",
    "the coulomb breakup cross sections are often analyzed by the virtual photon theory , in which the cross sections are given as a product of the photo absorption cross sections , eq .",
    "( [ sigma_gamma ] ) , and the virtual photon flux , @xmath55@xcite .",
    "figure 6 shows the experimental @xmath41(e1 ) distribution for the @xmath0be nucleus obtained by the coulomb breakup reaction at 72 mev / nucleon@xcite .",
    "the observed dipole strength shows a strong peak at about 800 kev excitation energy , which is consistent with the binding energy of about 500 kev .",
    "the peak is large , and is again consistent with the halo structure of this nucleus .",
    "in addition to the large interaction cross sections@xcite , large coulomb breakup cross sections are experimentally observed also for @xmath56c and @xmath2ne @xcite .",
    "these nuclei are thus considered to be good candidates for halo nuclei .",
    "let us now discuss properties of two - neutron halo nuclei , in which two valence neutrons are weakly bound to a core nucleus .",
    "for these nuclei , one must consider a ( pairing ) interaction between the valence neutrons .",
    "it has been well recognized that the pairing correlation plays an important role in nuclear physics@xcite .",
    "it leads to an extra binding for even - mass nuclei , and at the same time reduces the level density in the low energy region .",
    "also , a pairing interaction scatters nucleon pairs from a single - particle level below the fermi surface to those above , and consequently each single - particle level is occupied only partially . for weakly bound nuclei , the pairing interaction works by scattering nucleon pairs inevitably to unbound states",
    "if one adopts a three - body model for a two - neutron halo nucleus , one could view it as a system of two interacting fermions inside a confining potential .",
    "this is in a sense similar to a problem of interacting fermion gas in a harmonic trap in atomic physics ( see _ e.g. , _ refs . and , and references therein ) .",
    "but a problem is much more challenging in weakly bound nuclei , because a trapping potential is not an infinite well ( in contrast to a harmonic trap ) so that the couplings to continuum are important , and also because a trapping potential itself is constructed self - consistently from the interaction among nucleons .    among two - neutron halo nuclei ,",
    "the so called borromean nuclei have attracted lots of attention .",
    "these are unique three - body bound systems , in which any two - body subsystem is not bound @xcite .",
    "typical examples include @xmath0li and @xmath4he , which can be viewed as three - body systems consisting of a core nucleus and two valence neutrons .",
    "since both the @xmath18-@xmath18 and @xmath18-core two - body subsystems are not bound , these nuclei are bound only as three - body systems .",
    "one of the most important current open questions concerning the borromean nuclei is to clarify the characteristic nature of correlations between the two valence neutrons , which do not form a bound state in the vacuum .",
    "for instance , a spatial structure of two valence neutrons in the borromean nuclei has attracted much attention . as a matter of fact , this has a long history of research as a general problem in nuclear physics .",
    "one of the oldest publications on this problem is by bertsch , broglia , and riedel , who solved a shell model for @xmath57pb and showed that the two valence neutrons are strongly clusterized @xcite .",
    "subsequently , migdal argued that two neutrons may be bound in a nucleus even though they are not bound in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "the strong localization of two neutrons inside a nucleus has been referred to as _",
    "dineutron correlation_. it has been shown in ref . that the dineutron correlation is caused by admixtures of a few single - particle orbits with opposite parity .",
    "although the dineutron correlation exists even in stable nuclei @xcite , it is enhanced in weakly bound nuclei because the admixtures of single - particle orbits with different parities are easier due to the couplings to the continuum spectra .",
    "probably it was hansen and jonson who exploited the idea of dineutron correlation explicitly for exotic nuclei for the first time .",
    "they proposed the dineutron cluster model and successfully analyzed the matter radius of @xmath0li @xcite .",
    "they also predicted a large coulomb dissociation cross section of the @xmath0li nucleus . in the 1990 s , more microscopic three - body model calculations for neutron - rich nuclei started@xcite .",
    "these three - body model calculations have revealed that a strong dineutron correlation , where the two valence neutrons take a spatially compact configuration , indeed exists in weakly - bound borromean nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the dineutron correlation exists also in heavier neutron - rich nuclei @xcite as well as in infinite neutron matter @xcite .",
    "the diproton correlation , which is a counter part of the dineutron correlation , has also been shown to exist in the proton - rich borromean nucleus , @xmath58ne@xcite .",
    "7(a ) and 7(b ) show the two - particle density obtained with three - body model calculations for @xmath0li and @xmath4he , respectively .",
    "these are plotted as a function of the neutron - core distance , @xmath59 and the opening angle between the valence neutrons , @xmath60 .",
    "a weight of @xmath61 has been multiplied .",
    "see ref . for the details of the calculations .",
    "one can see that a large fraction of two - particle density is concentrated in the region with small opening angle @xmath60 for both the nuclei .",
    "this is a clear manifestation of the strong dineutron correlation discussed in this subsection .",
    "the coulomb breakup of two - neutron halo nuclei can be discussed in a similar manner as that of one - neutron halo nuclei discussed in sec .",
    "the only difference is that the e1 operator is now given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the center of mass coordinate for the two valence neutrons , and the e1 effective charge is given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 being the mass and charge numbers for the core nucleus .",
    "the left and the right panels of fig .",
    "8 show the measured @xmath41(e1 ) distribution for the @xmath0li and @xmath4he nuclei@xcite , respectively .",
    "those @xmath41(e1 ) distributions , especially that for the @xmath0li nucleus , show a strong concentration in the low excitation region , similar to the @xmath41(e1 ) distribution for the @xmath0be nucleus shown in fig .",
    "6 , reflecting the halo structure of these nuclei .",
    "moreover , the experimental data for @xmath0li are consistent with the theoretical calculation only when the interaction between the valence neutrons is taken into account , strongly suggesting the existence of the dineutron correlation in this nucleus ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the left and the right panels of fig .",
    "9 show calculated dipole strength distributions , @xmath67 , of @xmath0li and @xmath4he , respectively , obtained with the three - body model@xcite together with the green s function method for the continuum dipole response@xcite . here , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is the relative energy between the first ( second ) neutron and the core nucleus .",
    "one immediately notices that the strength distribution is considerably different between @xmath0li and @xmath4he , despite similar ground state density to each other ( see fig .",
    "this difference has been shown to be due to the different resonance properties of the neutron - core interaction between the two nuclei@xcite ( see also ref . ) .      until recently na was the lightest element of which charge radii ( or proton density distribution radii ) of neutron - rich short lived isotopes have been measured .",
    "combined with the measurements of matter radii , the development of neutron skins thus has been presented for na isotopes@xcite . for neutron halo nuclei , interaction cross section and fragmentation measurements have provided a mean to determine the matter density distribution .",
    "however the proton density distribution could not be determined directly from such measurements .",
    "although the proton distribution has been considered no to extend out even when neutron halos are formed , based on the fact that narrow momentum distributions , that indicate long tails of distribution , are observed only for a neutron or two - neutron removal channels of fragmentation , no direct determination of proton distribution radii ( or charge radii ) was possible until recently .",
    "recent developments of ion traps now provide a means to determine charge radii of very light neutron rich nuclei including neutron halo nuclei , @xmath4he , @xmath0li , and @xmath0be .",
    "the charge radii are determined by the isotope shift measurements of atomic transitions . in a very light atom ,",
    "the isotope shift @xmath70 includes two terms , @xmath71 the first term @xmath72 is the mass shift that is proportional to the difference of the masses ( @xmath7 and @xmath73 ) of two isotopes , @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the field shift which is proportional to the difference of the rms radii of nuclei , @xmath76 ^ 2\\times\\delta\\langle   r^2\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the atomic number of the isotopes and @xmath78 ^ 2 $ ] is the difference of the electron wave function at the nuclei . to obtain the field shift",
    ", the mass shift has to be calculated theoretically and then subtracted from the total isotope shift determined from the measurement .    for a light nucleus as an example , the mass shift term for @xmath4he and @xmath79he is more than 10@xmath80 times larger than the shift expected from a change of radius .",
    "the mass shift term can not be separately measured experimentally so that an accurate theoretical estimation of this term is necessary in order to determine the charge radii .",
    "the recent development of atomic theory of a few electron system has enabled to do such a calculations successfully up to three electron systems@xcite .",
    "the charge radii of @xmath4he and @xmath3he have been determined by the anl group using anl / atlas and ganil rib facilities to be 2.054@xmath90.014 fm and 1.93@xmath90.03 fm , respectively @xcite .",
    "those experiments use a magneto - optical trap of atoms for precision laser spectroscopy .",
    "the charge radii of li and be isotopes are determined by a gsi group using triumf / isac facility and isolde rib facilities @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "a doppler - free two - photon transition was used for the lithium measurements @xcite and collinear laser spectroscopy with a frequency comb for the beryllium isotopes @xcite .",
    "the proton distribution rms radii , @xmath81 , has been calculated from the charge radii , @xmath82 , by , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the radius of point proton distribution of a nucleus , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the charge radii of free proton and free neutron , @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 @xcite , and the last term is the so called darwin - foldy term ( 0.033 @xmath89 ) @xcite .",
    "the relation between matter , proton , and neutron rms radii is written as , @xmath90 the rms radii of matter ( or point nucleon distribution ) , @xmath91 , have been determined by the interaction cross section and reaction cross section measurements @xcite .",
    "the matter ( @xmath91 ) , proton ( @xmath92 ) , and neutron ( @xmath93 ) radii so determined are presented in fig .",
    "10 for he , li , and be isotopes .",
    "one can clearly see that @xmath92 is much smaller that that of neutron @xmath93 in neutron rich isotopes and in particular in halo nuclei .",
    "however the proton radius increases slightly when neutron halo is formed .",
    "this observation is consistent with the view of a core+decoupled halo neutron(s ) structure of halo nuclei that has been widely used for modeling halo nuclei . under this model",
    ", the core of a halo nucleus has the same proton distribution as the isolated core nucleus . because of the large distance between the core and the halo neutron(s )",
    ", the core moves around the center of mass of the halo nucleus and therefore the proton radius in a halo nucleus is larger than that of isolated core .",
    "the relation between nucleon , proton , and neutron mean - square ( ms ) radii for a nucleus @xmath94 is given by a similar equation as eq .",
    "( [ rmsradius ] ) . therefore from the measurements of matter and charge radii of a halo nucleus and its core nucleus , all radii of the halo nucleus , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , and the core , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , are determined .",
    "one can also define the ms matter radii of the halo neutrons , @xmath101 , and that of the core , @xmath102 , which are related as , @xmath103 where @xmath7 , @xmath65 , and @xmath104 are the mass numbers of the halo nucleus , the core nucleus , and the number of halo neutrons , respectively .    using the coordinate of the core nucleus , @xmath105 , relative to the center of mass of the halo nucleus ,",
    "that is , the movement of the center of the core in the halo nucleus , the relation between the nucleon , proton , and neutron radii between the core and the halo nucleus are represented as , @xmath106 from those equations , one can obtain the movement of the core , @xmath107",
    ". then the ms radius of the halo distribution , @xmath101 , is also determined from eq .",

    "the distance between the center of mass of the halo nucleus and the center of mass of the two halo neutrons ( @xmath108 ) can be calculated from @xmath109 , @xmath110 the distance between the core and the two - neutron center of mass is @xmath111 .",
    "let us define the size of di - neutron as the distribution radius of the neutrons around the center of mass of halo neutrons , @xmath112 , and thus @xmath113 , that is , @xmath114 is the radius of the di - neutron forming the halo .",
    "the radius of the halo distribution in the halo nucleus and the dineutron radius is related as , @xmath115 using these @xmath101 and @xmath116 , one can determine the di - neutron ms radius and thus the ms separation distance @xmath117 of the two halo neutrons . notice that combining eqs .",

    "corresponding theoretical values are also shown in the tables for a few model calculations .",
    "the data for @xmath4he and @xmath0li show that the distance between the core and the halo neutrons , @xmath123 , is almost equal to the distance between two neutrons , @xmath124 , indicating that two - neutrons are sitting close together and have strong _ di - neutron _ correlations .",
    "the opening angle between the valence neutrons with respect to the core nucleus can be calculated from the empirical values for @xmath123 and @xmath124 to be @xmath125 and @xmath126 degrees for @xmath0li and @xmath4he , respectively .",
    "( we should remark here that it is misleading to say that two neutrons are mostly sitting with opening angles obtained in this way .",

    "however it is known that the possible core @xmath4he is known not to be a good inert core and thus @xmath4he + 2@xmath18 model is very poor .",
    "instead , it is known from the fragmentation experiment @xcite that @xmath79he + 4@xmath18 is a good model of @xmath3he ground state . following the similar procedure as above",

    "this value is much smaller than that in @xmath4he , @xmath128 fm .",
    "it is an indication that the four neutrons in @xmath3he are distributed more uniformly than in @xmath4he .",
    "notice that the core-2n rms distance , @xmath129 , for two - neutron halo nuclei can be estimated also from the coulomb dissociation cross sections . for the transition operator given by eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , the expectation value of @xmath130 in the ground state can be estimated from the total @xmath41(e1 ) value as @xmath131 ( see also eq .",
    "( [ tote1 ] ) ) . using the experimental matter radii to estimate the rms distance @xmath124 ,",
    "the opening angle between the valence neutrons with respect to the core nucleus has been extracted as @xcite @xmath132 degrees for @xmath0li and @xmath133 degrees for @xmath4he ( see also ref . ) , which agree well with the results of the three - body model calculation of ref . .",
    "the value of @xmath134 for @xmath0li is consistent also with the one obtained in table 1 and 2 , although the value for @xmath4he is somewhat larger .",
    "although the experimental observation of the strong low - lying dipole strength distribution in the @xmath0li nucleus ( see fig . 8) has provided an experimental signature of the existence of dineutron correlation in this nucleus , it is still an open question how to probe it directly .",
    "that is , in the coulomb breakup process , the ground state wave function of a two - neutron halo nucleus is perturbed by the external electromagnetic field of the target nucleus , and it may not be easy to disentangle the dineutron correlation in the ground state from that in the excited states",
    ". it would be desirable if one could find an observable which reflects only the properties of the ground state .",
    "the two - proton radioactivity , that is , a spontaneous emission of two valence protons , of proton - rich nuclei @xcite is expected to provide a good tool to probe the di - proton correlation in the initial wave function .",
    "nuclei beyond the proton drip line are unstable against proton emission , but , since a proton has to penetrate the coulomb barrier , their lifetime is sufficiently long to study their spectroscopic properties",
    ". a single - proton radioactivity has been found in many odd - z proton - rich nuclei , and has provided a powerful tool to study the spectroscopy of proton - rich nuclei beyond the proton - drip line @xcite . when the single - proton emission is energetically forbidden , proton - rich nuclei beyond the proton drip line decay via emission of two protons . even though this process had been predicted theoretically in 1960@xcite , its first experimental discovery was much later , only in 2002 @xcite , for the @xmath135fe nucleus .",
    "subsequently , the energy and the angular distributions of the two emitted protons were also measured @xcite . an impressive development in ref . was the use of a new type of a gaseous detector , in which images of ionizing particle trajectories can be optically recorded with a ccd camera",
    "an example of recorded trajectories of the two emitted protons from the two - proton radioactivity of @xmath136fe is shown in fig .",
    "this technique was used also for the two - proton radioactivity of @xmath137ni@xcite .    very recently , a ground state _ two - neutron _",
    "emission was discovered for the first time for @xmath138be@xcite .",
    "this is an analogous process of the two - proton radioactivity , corresponding to a penetration of two neutrons over a centrifugal barrier . for the @xmath138be nucleus ,",
    "the one - neutron emission process is energetically forbidden , which makes @xmath138be an ideal two - neutron emitter .",
    "it is remarkable that the observed energy and the angular distributions of the two emitted neutrons show a strong indication of the dineutron correlation in the ground state of @xmath138be ( see fig .",
    "13)@xcite .",
    "it has been recognized for a long time that two - neutron transfer reactions are sensitive to the pairing correlation@xcite .",
    "the probability for the two - neutron transfer process is enhanced as compared to a naive expectation of sequential transfer process , that is , the square of one - neutron transfer probability@xcite .",
    "the enhancement of pair transfer probability has been attributed to the pairing effect , such as the enhancement of pair strength function @xcite and the surface localization of a cooper pair@xcite .",
    "the pair transfer reaction is thus considered to provide a promising way to probe the dineutron correlation discussed in sec .",
    "however , the reaction dynamics is rather complicated and has not even been well established .",
    "for instance , it is only in a recent calculation that a theoretical calculation achieves a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data@xcite",
    ". it would therefore be not surprising that the role of dineutron in the pair transfer reaction has not yet been fully clarified .",
    "one example is a relative importance of the one - step ( the simultaneous pair transfer ) process and the two - step ( the sequential pair transfer ) process . in heavy - ion pair transfer reactions of stable nuclei ,",
    "both processes are known to play a role @xcite . for weakly - bound nuclei , most of the intermediate states for the two - step process are likely in the continuum spectra .",
    "it is still an open question how this fact , together with the @xmath139-value matching condition @xcite , alters the dynamics of the pair transfer reaction of neutron - rich nuclei@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cross sections for the pair transfer reaction of the borromean nuclei , @xmath0li and @xmath4he , have been measured recently @xcite .",
    "the data for the @xmath140h(@xmath0li,@xmath5li)@xmath141h reaction at 3 mev / nucleon indicate that the cross sections are indeed sensitive to the pair correlation in the ground state of @xmath0li ( see fig .",
    "14 ) @xcite .",
    "that is , the experimental cross sections can be accounted for only when the @xmath23-wave component is mixed in the ground state of @xmath0li by 30 - 50% .",
    "another important finding in this measurement is that significant cross sections were observed for the pair transfer process to the first excited state of @xmath5li@xcite , which has made a good support for the idea of phonon mediated pairing mechanism@xcite .",
    "the two - neutron transfer from @xmath4he was investigated using @xmath79he and @xmath24 targets at flnr(dubna ) at 151 mev @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution from the @xmath79he(@xmath4he,@xmath79he)@xmath4he reaction shows dominant contribution from di - neutron configuration ( see the dashed line in fig .",
    "15 ( a ) ) .",
    "while the wavefunction contains both the cigar and di - neutron correlation the amplitude of the latter is larger ( fig.15 ( b ) , see also fig . 7 ) .",
    "the elastic scattering @xmath79he(@xmath4he,@xmath4he)@xmath79he was also studied at center of mass energies of 11.6 mev and 15.9 mev at the arenas facility at louvain - la - neuve @xcite .",
    "an interpretation of the data at both energies @xcite showed that the rise of cross section at large angle were due to two - neutron transfer .",
    "the calculation was carried out based on the coupled reaction channels approach @xcite including both one - step and sequential two - step transfer with realistic form factors .",
    "it was further found @xcite that the direct two - neutron transfer strongly dominates over the sequential transfer at the low energies where the minimum in the angular distribution @xcite is due to direct 2n transfer .",
    "the sequential transfer becomes more sizable for the higher - energy data , though direct 2n transfer still dominates . in the analysis in ref .",

    "the direct two - neutron transfer was found to be mainly due to the contribution from the s - wave .",
    "the p - wave part of the wave function belongs to the cigar type configuration , which is found to be a smaller contribution .",
    "the main conclusion is thus the same as ref . , and the dominance of s - wave two - neutron cluster transfer shows strongly correlated two neutrons in @xmath4he .    the @xmath24(@xmath4he,@xmath79he)@xmath144 angular distribution @xcite ( fig .",
    "16 ) when compared with the @xmath4li(@xmath24,@xmath141he)@xmath79he , shows a slightly larger cross section for 2@xmath18 transfer at the center - of - mass ( cm ) scattering angles near 60 degrees .",
    "this was interpreted to be a signature of a more disperse 2@xmath18 wavefunction in @xmath4he compared to the compact @xmath25 in @xmath4li . in both reactions",

    "the data are closer in magnitude and shape to the 2@xmath18 transfer than the transfer of tritons .",
    "therefore , the @xmath79he+2@xmath18 configuration of @xmath4he is again confirmed .    in the experiment with a heavier target ,",
    "that is , the @xmath4he+@xmath146cu reaction at @xmath147=22.6 mev , both the 1-neutron ( 1@xmath18 ) and the 2-neutron ( 2@xmath18 ) transfer cross sections were measured @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation for this system is that the cross sections for the 2@xmath18 transfer are much larger than those for the 1@xmath18 transfer@xcite . for stable nuclei ,",
    "usually the 1@xmath18 transfer cross sections are much larger than the 2@xmath18 transfer cross sections@xcite , and the opposite observation for the @xmath4he+@xmath146cu system can be regarded as a characteristic feature of a borromean nucleus . a similar tendency , although less clearly , has been observed also for the transfer reactions for the @xmath3he+@xmath148au system at a similar energy@xcite .",
    "this measurement also shows that the transfer cross sections for the @xmath3he projectile are considerably larger than those for the @xmath4he projectile at energies around the coulomb barrier@xcite , while these nuclei behave similar to each other in the subbarrier fusion reactions@xcite .",

    "we list some of these below :    1 .",
    "the most prominent discovery was the halo structure , in which the neutron density distribution largely extends over the proton distribution .",
    "in stable nuclei , the neutron and the proton distributions are similar to each other within a scaling factor , and thus the halo structure is a clear manifestation of the decoupling of proton and neutron in weakly bound nuclei .",
    "the halo structure is ascribed to an occupation of either @xmath23 or @xmath24 orbits , for which the root mean square radius diverges in the zero binding limit .",
    "typical examples of the halo nuclei include @xmath4he , @xmath0li , and @xmath0be .",
    "@xmath2ne has also been identified recently as a deformed halo nucleus .",
    "a similar decoupling effect is the skin structure .",
    "while the halo structure corresponds to a long low - density tail of neutron distribution , the skin structure corresponds to a layer of extremely neutron - rich matter .",
    "the matter radii of neutron - rich nuclei have been systematically studied with interaction cross section and isotope shift measurements .",
    "neutron - rich nuclei often show a soft dipole excitation , that is , dipole strengths in the low excitation energy region . for halo nuclei ,",
    "the soft dipole mode is attributed to the threshold effect , that is , the optimal matching of wave functions between a weakly bound and continuum states . for skin nuclei ,",
    "the low - lying dipole resonances have been referred to as the pygmy dipole mode .",
    "even though the exact nature of the pygmy dipole mode has not yet been fully clarified , it has been expected that it is closely related to the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "4 .   the dineutron correlation in neutron - rich nuclei , such as @xmath0li and @xmath4he , has been theoretically predicted .",
    "this is a spatial correlation , with which two valence neutrons take a compact configuration .",
    "the recent experimental data for the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0li strongly suggests the existence of the dineutron correlation in @xmath0li . a similar correlation in proton rich nuclei ,",
    "that is , the diproton correlation has also been predicted .",
    "the two - nucleon radioactivities as well as the two - neutron transfer reactions are expected to provide a direct probe of the dineutron correlation .",
    "another important feature in neutron - rich nuclei is the change of ( spherical ) magic numbers .",
    "it was considered that the magic numbers exist independently for proton and neutron .",
    "however in neutron - rich nuclei some of the magic numbers have been found to disappear ( @xmath150=8 and 20 ) and a new spherical magic number appears ( @xmath150=16 ) .",
    "these changes have revealed the importance of tensor interaction .",
