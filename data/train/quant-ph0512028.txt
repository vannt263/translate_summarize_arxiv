    "it is widely accepted that the bohr condition @xmath2 expresses the energy conservation in the quantum transition from the state with energy @xmath3 to the state with energy @xmath4 , induced by the interaction of the system with the electromagnetic field of circular frequency @xmath0 .",
    "it may be generalized to @xmath5 with an integer @xmath6 , when the system is interacting with a laser .",
    "this generalized bohr condition is still thought to be an expression of the energy conservation in the transition , with the number of absorbed or emitted photons being more than 1 .",
    "the transitions satisfying ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath7 had been observed experimentally in forms of the multi - photon ionization ( mpi)@xcite and the above threshold ionization ( ati)@xcite . here , we would emphasize that the bohr condition ( [ 1 ] ) or ( [ 2 ] ) is approximate , and its energy conservation interpretation is not exact either .",
    "as we know , every spectrum line has its width .",
    "it means there is always an error when ( [ 1 ] ) is applied to an individual transition .",
    "it becomes specially obvious when we apply it to the magnetic resonances . in this case , the resonance frequency is determined by a constant magnetic field , and the width of resonance is determined by a rotating magnetic field .",
    "the strengths of these two fields are comparable .",
    "it means , in most individual magnetic transitions the bohr condition ( [ 1 ] ) is seriously violated .",
    "however , the violation of bohr condition does not mean the violation of energy conservation . since the energy conservation means that the total energy of the system and the electromagnetic fields does not change , but the sum of the energy of the system and that of the electromagnetic fields is not the total energy .",
    "their difference is the interaction energy between the system and the electromagnetic fields . only when this difference is negligible , the bohr condition becomes a good approximation of energy conservation , and therefore has to be fulfilled . in this case",
    "the interaction energy may be regarded as a perturbation .",
    "it is realized for the transitions in weak fields . in the following ,",
    "we shall see , for the transitions in lasers , bohr condition may be badly violated . for an individual transition we always have @xmath8 with",
    "@xmath9 being defined in it . for transitions in strong electromagnetic fields , like in lasers",
    ", @xmath10 may be quite different from any integer .",

    "@xmath31 is the bohr radius , f is the confluent hypergeometric function , and y is the spherical harmonic function . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are spherical coordinates of the electron .",
    "now , let us expand @xmath34 in terms of the wave functions [ @xmath35 : @xmath36 this is an approximation , since the set [ @xmath35 of bound states only is not complete . we expect that it is good enough for the state @xmath34 near a low lying bound state .",
    "we further assume that in the expansion ( [ 23 ] ) only terms with @xmath37 are important , therefore one may truncate the summation on the right at @xmath38 .",
    "this makes the eigen - equation ( [ 21 ] ) become an linear algebraic equation , and therefore may be solved by the standard method@xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath39 on the right of ( [ 22 ] ) makes the matrix elements of @xmath25 be real in the @xmath40 representation .",
    "therefore the solutions @xmath41 $ ] are real .",
    "we have the reciprocal expansion @xmath42 suppose the hydrogen atom stays in the state @xmath43 when @xmath44 .",
    "the laser arrives at @xmath45 . according to ( [ 16 ] ) , ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 21 ] ) , at @xmath46 , the pseudo - state will be @xmath47 and the state becomes @xmath48 the transition probability of the hydrogen atom from the state @xmath43 to the state @xmath49 is @xmath50 it is a multi - periodic function of @xmath51 .",
    "the periods are of the microscopic order of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the observation is done in a macroscopic duration .",

    "the perturbation becomes @xmath61 the selection rules of its non - zero matrix elements include @xmath62 if the bohr condition @xmath63 is fulfilled , pseudo - states @xmath43 and @xmath49 with @xmath64 are degenerate . the correct zeroth - order approximation of eigen - states of @xmath25 has to be formed by their superpositions .",
    "the problem is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem of a two level system . in the limit of @xmath65 , a resonance factor of type ( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath66",
    "appears . on the contrary , if the condition ( [ 29 ] ) is not fulfilled , the transition probability is zero in the zeroth - order perturbation .",
    "we see , the transition probability calculated by ( [ 27 ] ) is in agreement with that obtained by the traditional method .",
    "this result may be regarded as a check of the method proposed here .",
    "now let us use it to consider the transitions in lasers .    the @xmath40 representation of @xmath25 ,",

    "it is solved numerically by the standard method@xcite for various values of @xmath55 and @xmath69 . substituting the solved eigen - vectors into ( [ 27 ] ) , we obtain transition probabilities for these cases .",
    "the results are shown in the following figures .",
    "fig.[c1 ] shows that the spectrum is continuous .",
    "no discrete sharp resonance peaks appear .",
    "if one fits the spectrum by ( [ 3 ] ) , @xmath10 may take any real number in a wide range , not necessarily be an integer .",
    "the transition is non - integer . while fig.[c2 ] shows that the transition probability is not proportional to an integer power of the laser intensity .",
    "it means , the interaction between the laser and the atom can not be reduced to the interaction of individual photons with the atom separately .",
    "the interaction is between the atom and the laser as a whole .",
    "this scenery is quite different from the regularity one saw in the weak light ( including weak laser ) spectroscopy , therefore has to be checked by new experiments .",
    "one may observe the radiation of the atom when it is irradiated by an intense laser .",
    "this is the laser raman effect . in this way",
    ", the changes of distributions of atoms among various energy levels , and therefore their transition probabilities , are measured .",
    "although there is not any separate resonance , fig.[c1 ] still shows complex structure in the spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to find out the information exposed by this kind of structure .",
    "the photo - ionization or the photoelectric effect is the transition of the electron from the ground state to the ionized state , when it is irradiated by light .",
    "the photo - ionization by an intense circularly polarized laser may be handled by the method proposed in @xcite .",
    "some preliminary results obtained by this method have been reported in @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "we would analyze it from the view point of non - integer quantum transition .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , that the energy of the ionized electron ( photo - electron ) is @xmath70 and the transition probability per unit time is @xmath71 with @xmath72 @xmath26 in ( [ 33 ] ) is an eigenfunction of @xmath25 , satisfying ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "@xmath28 in ( [ 31 ] ) is the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "@xmath73 is the eigenfunction of @xmath40 , with eigenvalue @xmath74 , therefore is a projection of the coulomb wave function onto the subspace with definite magnetic quantum number @xmath75 , and describes the ionized electron .    in the weak light limit , @xmath65",
    ", @xmath34 approaches an eigenfunction of @xmath40 , which is also the ground state eigenfunction of @xmath76 with zero magnetic quantum number ; and @xmath28 approaches the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "they are independent of @xmath55 . for the hydrogen atom , they are @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , @xmath79 is the binding energy of the electron in the ground state hydrogen atom . in the case of @xmath60",
    ", we have ( [ 280 ] ) , therefore the selection rule ( [ 281 ] ) works .",
    "these limits make the energy ( [ 31 ] ) of the photoelectron be @xmath80 and the transition probability @xmath81 proportional to the light intensity .",
    "this example shows , in the weak light limit , the photo - ionization has the following distinct characters :    0.1 in c1.there is a critical frequency for a given system.the light with frequency lower than this critical value can not eject any electron from the system .",
    "c2.the light with frequency higher than this critical value can ionize the system , the energy of the ejected electron increases linearly with the increasing of the frequency but is independent of the intensity of the light .",
    "c3.the intensity of the photo - electric current is proportional to the intensity of the light .",
    "0.1 in this is exactly the experimental knowledge on photo - ionization , people had before the discovery of the laser .",
    "based on this knowledge and guided by his idea of light quanta , one hundred years ago , einstein @xcite found his famous formula ( [ 34 ] ) and the idea that the light - atom interaction may be reduced to the interactions between photons and atoms . in this way",
    ", he explained the above experimental characters of photo - ionization .",
    "this was a crucial step towards the discovery of quantum mechanics .",
    "now we see , all of these experimental characters , as well as the einstein formula ( [ 34 ] ) , together with his idea that photons interact with atoms independently , are the perturbation results of quantum mechanics in the weak light limit",
    ". what will be the scenery when the light becomes an intense laser ?    if one puts @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , the formula ( [ 34 ] ) becomes ( [ 1 ] ) with the positive sign on the right .",
    "therefore , the einstein formula is a predecessor of the bohr condition . soon after the discovery of laser , people observed the mpi@xcite and the ati@xcite .",
    "einstein formula was generalized to be @xmath84 with @xmath6 being an positive integer .",
    "this is something like a special case of the generalized bohr condition ( [ 2 ] ) and may be deduced by the higher order perturbation .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) would be an exact expression of the photoelectron energy , if @xmath28 in it is solved from ( [ 21 ] ) exactly . defining @xmath85",
    "one may write ( [ 31 ] ) in the form @xmath86 it is a special case of ( [ 3 ] ) . here",
    "we see , @xmath10 is an integer only when @xmath87 is an integer multiple of the photon energy @xmath1",
    ". this will not necessarily be the case for a non - perturbation interaction between the atom and an intense laser .",
    "it means the photo - ionization will be a non - integer quantum transition .",
    "this is the true non - perturbation effect . using the numerical solution of ( [ 21 ] )",
    "obtained in the last section , we find the light intensity dependence of the photoelectron energy .",
    "the numerical result is shown in fig.[c3 ] .",
    "the transition probability ( [ 32 ] ) may be expressed in the form of cross section .",
    "it is the formula ( 14 ) or ( 15 ) in @xcite .",
    "applying it to the photo - ionization of the hydrogen atom irradiated by a circularly polarized laser , under the condition @xmath88 , we obtain the cross section @xmath89 in unit of @xmath90 .",
    "here , @xmath91 is the velocity of the photoelectron , and @xmath92 is an elementary but some what lengthy and tedious expression , containing integrals of the type @xmath93 the integral has been analytically worked out .",
    "there are two confluent hypergeometric functions f on the left .",
    "one is from the radial wave function of the electron in the hydrogen atom , and another is from the coulomb wave function of the outgoing electron .",
    "@xmath94 on the right is the appell s hypergeometric function of the second class in two variables@xcite . in our problem here",
    ", it degenerates into a polynomial in two variables .",
    "therefore the calculation of @xmath92 becomes finite , if the expansion ( [ 23 ] ) is truncated .",
    "the calculated cross section and its dependence on the laser intensity is shown in fig.[c4 ] .",
    "we see from fig.[c3 ] , the energy of the photo - electron increases with the increasing of the light intensity .",
    "the critical frequency is not absolute . even though the frequency of the incident light is lower than the critical frequency",
    ", the electron may still be ejected , if the light is intense enough .",
    "the characters c2 and c1 , together with the formula ( [ 34 ] ) , are not true for laser photo - ionization .",
    "furthermore , the formula ( [ 35 ] ) is not true either , if the incident laser is very strong .",
    "in this case , it has to be substituted by ( [ 36 ] ) , with non - integer @xmath10 .",
    "the transition in photo - ionization becomes non - integer .",
    "however , one may still see an apparent quantum character in fig.[c3 ] .",
    "that is , the energy difference between photo - electrons with different magnetic quantum number @xmath75 is an integer multiple of the quantum energy @xmath1 . from fig.[c4 ] we see , the cross sections depend on the light intensity nonlinearly .",
    "it means that the character c3 is not true for laser photo - ionization .",
    "the interaction between light and atoms can not be reduced to the independent interactions between photons and atoms .",
    "atoms interact with the laser as a whole .",
    "we omitted some effects in the foregoing sections . here",
    "let us say a few words on them .",

    "the first two terms mainly relate to the motion of the center of mass .",
    "only @xmath114 in the first term relates to the relative motion .",
    "but the big mass @xmath115 on the denominator makes its contribution be much less than that of the last five terms .",
