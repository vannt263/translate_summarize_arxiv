    "understanding the formation and evolution of large scale structures is of considerable importance to modern cosmology .",
    "while galaxy formation and evolution is receiving much warranted attention , the observational study of the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies or other large scale structures is only now developing .    to identify clusters at high redshifts",
    "is a challenging observational task . at low redshifts ,",
    "one can rely on the projected 2d galaxy density , as was done successfuly from the earliest photographic material ( e.g. , abell 1958 , zwicky 1961 - 1968 ) .",
    "however , at high redshifts , @xmath13 , it becomes increasingly difficult to identify the 2d galaxy overdensity produced by a cluster because the projected foreground and background galaxies are so numerous that the density contrast is severely reduced and chance alignments of groups of galaxies can mimic the appearance of clusters ( frenk et al .",
    "1990 ) .    the existence of a distant cluster can be proven only if several lines of evidence are combined , which should include the measurement of a projected overdensity of galaxies in few square arcmin area on the sky , combined with a significant overdensity observed in the redshift distribution of galaxies on velocity scales @xmath142000 km s@xmath2 in order to reduce the contamination by foreground and background interloper galaxies .",
    "in addition , evidence for hot gas , through the detection of x - ray emission , and/or evidence for a peaked mass distribution as indicated by weak or strong lensing of background galaxies , provide strong support for the identification of such overdensities as genuine clusters of galaxies .",
    "although a number of candidates have been proposed , only a few clusters ( or proto - clusters ) of galaxies have been unambiguously identified at z@xmath15 , with the above criteria fulfilled ( dickinson 1996 ; luppino & kaiser 1996 ) .",
    "it is of considerable importance for our knowledge of the evolution of large scale structure to identify more high redshift clusters in order to establish the evolution of their physical properties with redshift .",
    "one possible search strategy is to look for clusters of galaxies around known powerful radio galaxies ( yee & green 1984 ; hill & lilly 1991 ; dickinson 1996 ; le fvre et al .",
    "we present here the unambiguous identification of a cluster of galaxies around the radio galaxy 3cr184 , at a redshift z = 0.996 .",
    "h@xmath16 km s@xmath2mpc@xmath2 and @xmath17 are used throughout this _",
    "the field around 3cr184 was imaged in 1994 january with the multi - object - spectrograph ( mos ) at cfht ( le fvre et al 1994 ) in imaging mode .",
    "a 900s image was obtained in the @xmath18 band and deep images were also obtained in a narrow band filter centered on 7480   with a bandwidth of 200 , which includes the [ oii]3727  line redshifted to z@xmath19 , for a total integration time of 3600s .",
    "additional @xmath0 band images were obtained with the same instrumental setup on 1994 february 6 for a total integration time of 2400s .",
    "an initial selection of spectroscopic targets was performed on the basis of excess emission in the narrow band images .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up was performed on 1994 february 6 with mos in its multi - slit mode . a multi - slit mask with 37 slits , 2 arcseconds in width and at least 10 arcseconds in length each ,",
    "was used to obtain three spectroscopic exposures of 4800s each .",
    "the r300 grism provided a spectral resolution of 23 , and a wavelength coverage from 5000to 1@xmath20 m .",
    "data reduction was performed with the multired software implemented under iraf ( le fvre et al .",
    "two galaxies were subsequently identified at a redshift within a few hundred km s@xmath2 of the radio galaxy , indicating the possible presence of a cluster .",
    "additional spectra were obtained during 1995 december 20 - 24 with the same instrumental setup as described above . the object selection this time",
    "was based purely on the @xmath0-band magnitudes and spatial location on the plane of the sky .",
    "three additional multi - slit masks were used to obtain spectra for 122 objects .",
    "integration times of 15000 , 14400 , 15000s were obtained for masks 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "the linear geometry of the slit positions on each mask result in a selective sampling of galaxies on the sky .",
    "all of the objects observed are in an e - w strip of 85 @xmath21 285 and the ratio of spectroscopically identified objects to the total number of sampled objects fainter than the radio galaxy ( @xmath22 ) , and brighter than @xmath23 , is 0.35 in this strip .",
    "data processing followed the procedure outlined in le fvre et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . of 122 objects observed , 56 were identified as galaxies , 26 turned out to be galactic stars , 1 was identified as a quasar and the remaining 39 were unidentified .",
    "a more detailed description of the observational data will be given elsewhere ( deltorn et al .",
    "hst imaging was conducted with the wide field and planetary camera 2 during hst cycle 5 .",
    "a total exposure time of 11000s was obtained with the f814w filter and 6600s with the f606w filter .",
    "exposures were shifted by integral pixel values to allow for cosmic rays and bad pixel cleaning .",
    "standard hst pipeline data reduction was performed .",
    "photometry of 878 objects in the field was obtained , based on the hst photometric zero point calibration converted to vega units using the color corrections of holtzman et al .",
    "the completeness limit is @xmath24 , while objects can be detected down to @xmath25 .",
    "the image of a region @xmath26 arcsec@xmath27 around the radio galaxy is shown in figure 1 ( plate 1 ) .",
    "numerous faint galaxies can be seen in the immediate surroundings of the radio galaxy .",
    "the radio galaxy and two galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts which indicate membership in the cluster were imaged in the wfpc2 field ; their properties will be discussed elsewhere ( deltorn et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "one of the most interesting features in the images is the faint arc - like structure located 49 to the north - east of the radio galaxy .",
    "the arc is @xmath14 36 long and is visible in both the f606w and the f814w images .",
    "although it is possible that it is due to a chance superposition of several faint galaxies , the center of curvature of the arc is coincident with the radio galaxy and it is unresolved in the radial dimension .",
    "the arc has a secure detection @xmath28 in the f814w image and @xmath29 in the f606w filter .",
    "the magnitude of the arc is @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the presence of this gravitational arc close to the central radio galaxy indicates the proximity of a high concentration of mass .",
    "in order to quantify any projected excess number of galaxies in the vicinity of 3cr184 we have computed density maps using the estimator @xmath33 defined in dressler ( 1980 ) .",
    "cuts in magnitude were applied on the data in order to consider only objects that are fainter than the radio galaxy and brighter than @xmath34 for ground - based images and fainter than the radio galaxy and brighter than @xmath35 for hst data , the latter limiting magnitude corresponding to @xmath36 at rest , for objects at the redshift of 3cr184 .",
    "color selection was also introduced ; since high redshift early - type galaxies are on average redder than lower redshift ones we retained only those galaxies with @xmath37 for ground - based data and with @xmath38 for the hst data .",
    "those objects should predominantly lie at redshifts greater than 0.5 , increasing the projected galaxy density contrast of high redshift structures .",
    "the density maps constructed from the magnitude - limited and the color - limited samples for the hst data show a peak excess density around the radio galaxy corresponding to a @xmath39 and @xmath40 excess above the mean galaxy background respectively ; where @xmath41 corresponds to the square root of the variance of @xmath33 measured outside a radius of 1@xmath42 centered on the radio galaxy .",
    "the density peak lies 6@xmath42 east of the radio galaxy .",
    "the ground - based images show lower excess of @xmath43 and @xmath44 around 3cr184 for the magnitude - limited and the color - limited samples respectively .",
    "the central richness , @xmath45 ( bahcall 1981 ) , was computed after correction for the mean galaxy background estimated using the deep galaxy counts of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the hubble deep field , which led to a central richness of @xmath46 , the error being calculated assuming purely poisson statistics .",
    "this excess corresponds roughly to an abell richness class 2 cluster .",
    "the significance of the measured excess - far above the statistical `` noise '' - and the presence of redder objects around the radio galaxy ( the excess increasing with the v - i cut ) , combine to give confidence in the reality of the projected 2d overdensity .",
    "figure 2 shows the redshift distribution of the galaxies in our sample . from a total of 56 securely identified objects , 11 galaxies , including the radio galaxy , have velocities within + 1198/@xmath47750 kms@xmath2 of that of 3cr184 .",
    "the clear peak at @xmath4 apparent in figure 2 demonstrates the presence of an overdensity in velocity space around 3cr184 .",
    "the list of galaxies within this peak is given in table 1 .",
    "the redshift distribution expected for a similar size sample of field galaxies , as measured from deep redshift surveys ( crampton et al .",
    "1995 ) , indicates that 0.75 galaxies should be observed in a random sample of field galaxies in the same velocity bin , down to @xmath48 .",
    "it is therefore highly improbable that this excess is due to a random distribution .",
    "the observation of an excess density both in the projected @xmath49 space and in redshift space demonstrates unambiguously the reality of the clustering of galaxies around the bright radio galaxy 3cr184 .",
    "this , combined with the high concentration of mass , as demonstrated by presence of a gravitational arc , secures the identification of a cluster around 3cr184 .",
    "future deep x - ray observations of this field would provide useful complementary informations about the hot gaz emission of the cluster .",
    "the observation of a gravitational arc associated with a cluster of galaxies allows a direct determination of the mass within the perimeter defined by the arc . if a spherically - symmetric projected mass distribution is assumed , and the lensed galaxy is coincident with the direction of the cluster center , we have @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the angular distances from the lensed object , from the cluster , and between the cluster and the lensed galaxy respectively , and @xmath54 .",
    "we also assume @xmath55 ( @xmath56 being the einstein radius ) and the center of mass is taken to be coincident with the radio galaxy . for z@xmath57 in the range 1.53 , the mass enclosed within @xmath58 from the radio galaxy varies from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , with an average value of @xmath61 .",
    "+ if a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model is adopted , we then have the following central velocity dispersion : @xmath62 this gives @xmath63 $ ] km s@xmath2 for any value of z@xmath64 $ ] ( the average value being 756 km s@xmath2 ) , assuming the arc is centered on the radio galaxy . in the framework of sis approximation ,",
    "this velocity dispersion is independent of the radius .",
    "the measured redshifts of the cluster galaxies allow derivation of a velocity dispersion in the framework of the cluster .",
    "we obtain @xmath65 km s@xmath2 , for the sample of eleven galaxies which pass the exclusion criterion of yahill & vidal ( 1977 ) .",
    "the errors are estimated from both the redshift uncertainties and the sampling errors due to the small number of galaxies ( danese , de zotti , di tullio 1980 ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the velocity dispersion as deduced from the lensing configuration .",
    "assuming the isotropy , the spherical symetry of the mass distribution and the dynamical equilibrium of the structure we can derive an estimate of the deprojected virial mass . in the case of equal masses of the galaxies , we found @xmath10 , the errors being calculated from danese et al .",
    "( 1981 ) .",
    "the mass enclosed in a 1 @xmath66mpc radius can be estimated within the isothermal sphere approximation . considering a distribution of galaxies with density profile @xmath67 ,",
    "we have : @xmath68 where @xmath69 for isotropic orbits and @xmath70 ( seldner @xmath71 peebles 1977 ) . we find @xmath72 km s@xmath73 .",
    "taking the velocity dispersion deduced from the cluster galaxy redshifts leads to a lower value of the mass : @xmath74 km s@xmath75 .",
    "the mass to light ratio can be calculated within the radius defined by the arc .",
    "the total light within 49 from the radio galaxy was corrected from contamination due to field galaxies using the counts of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and the resulting i magnitude of the cluster population was then converted to @xmath76 , knowing that i band at a redshift of @xmath14 1 roughly corresponds to b band at rest , and assuming a no - evolution scenario for the spectral energy distribution of the cluster galaxies .",
    "we found a field - substracted luminosity of @xmath77 , leading to @xmath78within @xmath58 . using the isothermal sphere approximation",
    ", we found , after correction for the field galaxies contamination , a total luminosity within @xmath79 of @xmath80 leading to @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , if all cluster galaxies are subjected to a luminosity evolution similar to the one measured by the cfrs for field galaxies in the redshift range @xmath82 ( lilly et al . 1995),the correction to the observed luminosity would give @xmath83within @xmath58 and @xmath84 .",
    "we then believe that @xmath11 .",
    "this range is comparable to the higher @xmath85 found by smail et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for their distant cluster sample ( @xmath86 $ ] ) .",
    "our observations of the field around 3cr184 demonstrate unambiguously the presence of a cluster of galaxies , with an associated mass comparable to massive clusters observed locally .",
    "we stress that the identification is made possible by a combination of several diagnostics : excess in projected 2d density maps , excess in redshift space , lensing geometry , and mass estimate obtained from virial analysis of spectroscopically measured galaxies .",
    "+ the relative agreement , between the two estimates of the velocity dispersion - from the redshifts and the lensing analysis - converge in describing a quite massive cluster at the redshift of the radio galaxy .",
    "we find a lensing mass of @xmath61 within 42h@xmath87kpc , and derive a virial mass of @xmath88 .",
    "the cluster around 3cr184 is thus one of the very few massive structures yet identifed at redshifts larger than 0.9 , at epochs when the universe was less than 40% of its present age .",
    "while obtaining velocity dispersion and mass estimate is relatively straightforward , the description of the dynamical state of the cluster is much more uncertain . if a good agreement between virial and lensing masses has been demonstrated for some systems ( e.g. pks 0745 - 191 : allen , fabian @xmath71 kneib 1996 ; ms2137 - 23 : mellier et al .",
    "1993 ) , most arc - cluster associations reveal a significant discrepancy , likely due to the hypothesis involving the mass / velocity dispersion definitions ( miralda - escud @xmath71 babul 1995 ; wu 1996 ) , indicating that these clusters may not be considered as totally relaxed systems . in the case of the cluster around 3cr184 ,",
    "a comparision between the lens and virial velocity dispersions is limited by the limited sample of cluster galaxies , the difficulty in estimating the true center of mass of the presumed cluster , and the simplistic assumptions necessary to derive either @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( either an equilibrium state or a spherical symmetry ) .",
    "given the current observational dataset it is thus premature to speculate on the similarity between @xmath91 and @xmath92 to draw any conclusion regarding the dynamical state of the cluster around 3cr184 .",
    "the number of high redshift clusters seems to be steadily increasing as observational capabilities become more accute , and the observation of this massive structure at @xmath4 , combined with other observations of very high redshift clusters might come to be in severe conflict with various cosmological models . recently , the secure identifications of massive bound structures at @xmath93 , through spectroscopic observation of cluster members ( dickinson 1996 ; deltorn et al .",
    "1997 , francis et al .",
    "1996 ) , weak gravitational lensing ( luppino @xmath71 kaiser 1996 , smail @xmath71 dickinson 1995 ) , or x - ray observations ( luppino @xmath71 gioia 1995 , castander et al .",
    "1994 ) have shown that those structures might not be as rare as predicted by some cosmological scenarios . in cdm and even chdm models",
    ", the number of high redshift massive clusters predicted from both n - body simulations or the press - schechter formalism , seems to be too low with respect to observations ( jing @xmath71 fang 1994 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "hdm models predict too many high - z , high-@xmath94 structures ( lijle 1990 ) . alternatives and modifications to the standard cdm scenario have been advanced in order to account for the emerging data on large scale structure and the amplitude of cobe fluctuations . among them ,",
    "low @xmath95 models ( either flat or open ) provide a significant number density of massive high redshift clusters that may be compatible with recent observations ( eke , cole @xmath71 frenk 1996 ; viana @xmath71 liddle 1996 and ref . therein ) . as the abundance of massive structures provides increasing discrimination with increasing redshift , the identification , without ambiguity , of clusters at @xmath4 is now beginning to provide useful observational constraints to the cosmological models .",
