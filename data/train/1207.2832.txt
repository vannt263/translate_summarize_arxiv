    "the first observation of the @xmath0 decay into @xmath2 was reported by the belle collaboration in @xcite . later on this decay mode",
    "was confirmed by the babar collaboration in @xcite and more recently again in belle in @xcite .",
    "theoretically this decay mode had already some early attention and was studied in @xcite assuming either a charmonium state or a molecular state . a thorough discussion of the different models used and the results can be seen in @xcite , which has also been updated recently in @xcite .",
    "a recent work assuming the @xmath0 to be a charmonium state is presented in @xcite and assuming it to be a tretaquark in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is assumed to be a mixture of a charmonium and a molecular component , and uscing qcd sum rules a good rate is obtained for the @xmath8 decay mode versus the @xmath9 one , which is evaluated in @xcite . in @xcite the authors consider , like in the work of @xcite , the @xmath0 resonance to be a molecule of @xmath10 and , in addition , they include the possibility of a @xmath11 admixture . in @xcite",
    "an effective lagrangian is postulated to provide the coupling of the @xmath0 to the @xmath12 components , with an unknown wave function .",
    "the effective coupling needed in the loops for radiative decay of the @xmath0 is obtained using the weinberg compositness condition @xcite , reformulated in @xcite as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the loop function of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 propagators .",
    "the procedure has been shown to provide a fair description of the molecular states in other works @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite are tied to unknowns on the regularization of the loop functions , the @xmath17 parameter used in @xcite , and the binding .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath0 decay into the @xmath2 channel are of about 125 - 250 kev taking reasonable values for the @xmath17 parameter between 2 and 3 gev .    in @xcite",
    "the authors include the charge components of @xmath18 , which were found necessary to explain the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath6 and @xmath5 in @xcite .",
    "the novelty with respect to the previous work of @xcite is that the authors use a smaller @xmath17 cut off , of the order of 0.5 gev to regularize the loop function , such that the wave function of the @xmath10 is much more extended in space .",
    "the final results of the new evaluations differ quantitatively from those of @xcite and are now in the range of 2 - 17 kev .",
    "it is then clear that a more systematic approach to the problem has to be done if one wishes to obtain accurate numbers from the molecular picture of the @xmath0 .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "a consistent dynamical picture of the @xmath0 in the coupled channels of @xmath19 was elaborated in @xcite using an extrapolations to su(4 ) of chiral lagrangians used in the study of pseudoscalar meson interaction with vector mesons @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to extending to @xmath4 the local hidden gauge approach of @xcite with a particular @xmath4 breaking .",
    "given the subtlety of the small binding for the neutral @xmath20 component versus the about 7 mev binding for the charged @xmath21 components , a coupled channel approach considering these explicit channels with their exact mass and not assuming isospin symmetry , was done in @xcite , concluding that the coupling of the resonance to the neutral and charged components was very similar , which tells us that in strong processes the @xmath0 behaves as a rather good i=0 object .",
    "the @xmath22 components were also included in @xcite . on the other hand , the study of the wave functions of the resonance for each of its channels indicated that the couplings provided essentially the wave function at the origin , which indicates that the neutral component , extending further away in space than the charged components , because of the small binding , and having the same strenght at the origin , will have a larger probability in the wave function .",
    "but this has not repercussion in strong processes , of short range , or electromagnetic ones where there is production of real photons radiated from the components of the wave function , because they see the strength of the wave functions at the origin . in sum",
    ", the charged @xmath21 components have to be considered in the study of these processes .    in the present work",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite where all the couplings are accurately determined from the unitary coupled channel approach and are tied to the binding of the @xmath0 , which is generated dynamically as a composite state of @xmath23 in this picture . the mechanisms for radiative decay are then basically the same as in @xcite , except that we also have contribution from the @xmath24 components and have , although not much , different couplings of the resonance to the neutral and charged @xmath25 components .",
    "the work is also technically different .",
    "our approach has not ambiguities about the regularization of the loops , and most of the terms are shown to be convergent .",
    "some terms are formally divergent , but we can isolate the divergence into a term proportional to the same loop function g which appears in scattering .",
    "the function g is regularized in the scattering problem in order to fit the position of the resonance , so when it comes to evaluate the radiative decay it is already fixed .",
    "this makes the scheme fully selfconsistent and predictive , since one does not have to rely upon unknown parameters that have proved to have a strong repercussion in the numerical results from the former studies .",
    "traditionally the @xmath0 could be considered as a @xmath26 or @xmath27 state , and there is a work similar to the one of @xcite but assuming @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "here we will continue to use the @xmath26 , which is supported by recent analysis of data in @xcite .",
    "our work proceeds as follows : in the next section we present the formalims for the work with the feynman diagrams used and the scheme to evaluate them . in section [ res ] we present the results for @xmath28 and compare them to experiment , discussing the role of the charged components of the @xmath0 wave function . in section [ conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "in @xcite , the interaction between pseudoscalars and vector mesons is studied including the charm sector .",
    "the potential is like the weinberg - tomozawa interaction between pseudoscalar mesons but including the vector meson fields @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "all the different currents within the @xmath4 scheme are classified in terms of @xmath29 currents , and the breaking symmetry parameters are introduced to account for the suppression of the heavy meson exchange . within this formalism , the @xmath0 is a dynamically generated resonance from the interaction of @xmath30 , having an eigenstate of positive @xmath31-parity with isospin @xmath32 .",
    "it also has some component of @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , the basis of positive @xmath31-parity and @xmath32 for these two channels corresponds to : @xmath34 in @xcite it was found that the @xmath0 had couplings to the charged and neutral components of @xmath35 that were very close to each other , implying an approximate @xmath32 character for the state .",
    "since the masses and bindings used in @xcite have been updated , we have redone the calculation of @xcite with updated masses , assuming the present binding of @xmath36 of the @xmath0 with respect to the @xmath37 component .",
    "the result of the couplings are shown in table [ tab : x3872 ] .",
    "lr channel&@xmath38 [ mev ] + @xmath39&@xmath40 + @xmath41&@xmath42 + @xmath43&@xmath44 + @xmath45&@xmath46 + @xmath47&@xmath48 +    from the couplings in table [ tab : x3872 ] , we observe that there is some isospin violation , which is however very small , less than @xmath49 .",
    "intuitively , one might think that the @xmath50 component is the only relevant , because the binding of the @xmath51 is very small , of the order of @xmath36 and the wave function extends much further than for the charged component , which is bound by about @xmath52 . however , as we mentioned , the relevant interactions in most processes are short ranged and then the wave functions at the origin , proportional to the couplings , are what matters . in this sense",
    "it is found in @xcite that in the limit of the @xmath50 binding going to zero , all couplings go to zero , but the ratio of the couplings of the charged and neutral components goes to a constant close to one , which guarantees that the charged component will play an important role in physical processes .",
    "the conclusion is that the wave function of the @xmath0 is very close to the isospin @xmath32 combination of @xmath53 and @xmath54 and has a sizable fraction of the @xmath54 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : states ] ) .    from this table",
    "we can also see that the couplings to the @xmath55 and @xmath56 channels represent less than the @xmath49 of the contributions from the other channels ( the @xmath57 has even smaller strenght ) .",
    "therefore , we will treat the @xmath0 as if it were dynamically generated only from the last three channels in table [ tab : x3872 ] .     into @xmath8 . ]    in this picture , the @xmath0 decays into @xmath2 through the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] . from this figure",
    "we observe that there are four kinds of different feynman diagrams , all of them with an anomalous vertex coupling two vectors and a pseudoscalar ( vvp ) , depending on whether the diagram contains a ppv or a 3v vertex , or the photon emerges from the anomalous vertex . to begin with , there are three different channels : @xmath50 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which lead to @xmath60 , plus another @xmath60 for the complex congujate , feynman diagrams to evaluate .",
    "the formalism used is very similar to the one of @xcite where the authors study the radiative decay of the dynamically generated resonance @xmath61 @xcite into @xmath62 , via diagrams containing anomalous vector - vector - pseudoscalar vertices .",
    "the vpp , 3v and v@xmath63 vertices are evaluated using the local hidden gauge approach @xcite which automatically incorporates vector meson dominance , by means of which the photons couple to other hadrons converting itself into @xmath64 and @xmath3 .",
    "as a consequence of this , we are also able to evaluate the rates of the @xmath0 decay into @xmath65 and the ratios of the decay rates , which can be compared to existing data .    in summary , the lagrangians we need in order to evaluate the amplitude are listed below : @xmath66\\rangle\\label{lag3}\\\\ & \\mathcal{l}&_{3v}=ig\\langle ( v^\\mu \\partial_\\nu v_\\mu -\\partial_\\nu v_\\mu v^\\mu ) v^\\nu)\\rangle\\ , \\label{lag4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 the electron mass ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the constant @xmath73 is the pion decay constant @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the mass of the vector meson , for which we take @xmath77 .",
    "the p and v matrices contain the 15-plet of the pseudoscalars and the 15-plet of vectors respectively in the physical basis considering @xmath78 , @xmath79 mixing @xcite:@xmath80 and @xmath81 represents the vector nonet : @xmath82    from eqs .",

    "the @xmath94 conversion essentially replaces , up to a constant , @xmath95 by @xmath96 .",

    "the way to proceed is very similar to that of the previous diagram .",
    "the second term of the @xmath134 vertex proportional to @xmath135 does not contribute , since we have @xmath136 , which applying lorentz covariance in the integral turns into a term like @xmath137 .",

    "this formalism also allows us to evaluate the amplitudes for the decays @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( fig .",

    "we can proceed in complete analogy with the radiative decay to determine these amplitudes , simply removing the final photon and leaving the vector meson in the final state , the @xmath158 or the @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , we must take into account that the @xmath158 and the @xmath159 do not couple to the strange @xmath160 mesons , so that we have again four different kinds of diagrams , but only two channels plus their complex conjugate , that is 16 feynman diagrams to evaluate . doing this",
    ", we can observe that the new amplitudes have the same structure of the previous ones and can be obtained , up to a coefficient , directly with the substitutions @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",

( [ lag1 ] ) ) , the axial - vector - pseudoscalar couplings @xmath175 for the three channels , and the two subtraction constants in the loop function , @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "we allow the constant @xmath73 , contained in @xmath173 , to vary , but keeping the relationship @xmath71 and replacing @xmath178 by @xmath179 .",
    "the couplings @xmath175 for the neutral and strange channels are also varied , independently , by @xmath180 . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation of the coupling for the charged channel is such that the ratio between it and the one for the neutral channel is kept constant , in order to preserve the isospin of the @xmath0 .",
    "then , we let the subtraction constants @xmath176 and",
    "@xmath177 vary between @xmath181 and @xmath182 . this range is motivated by the range chosen for @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , going to higher values of the constant @xmath73 causes a decrease of the potential in the lippman - schwinger equation used to evaluate the scattering amplitude which determines the position of the resonance . one would need to go to more negative values of the subtraction constants @xmath176 and @xmath177 in the loop function , which appears in the @xmath105 coefficients , to keep the pole representing the resonance in the same position . the range is thus chosen such as to produce an effect in the pole position similar to that induced by the change in @xmath73 .",

    "we should stress that once the @xmath168 is obtained in our case and , hence , the couplings are determined , there is no freedom in our approach , which makes unique predictions , up to the small uncertainties tied to the limited range of variation of the parameters .",

    "<S> from a picture of the @xmath0 where the resonance is a bound state of @xmath1 , we evaluate the decay width into the @xmath2 channel , which is sensitive to the internal structure of this state .    for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the loops through which the @xmath0 decays into its components , and the @xmath3 and the photon are radiated from these components . </S>",
    "<S> we use the local hidden gauge approach extrapolated to @xmath4 with a particular @xmath4 breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative decay involves anomalous couplings and we obtain acceptable values which are compared to experiments and results of other calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> simultaneusly , we evaluate the decay rate for the @xmath0 into @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the results obtained for the ratio of these decay widths are compatible with the experiment .    </S>",
