    "high - energy @xmath2 collisions can be classified into the following two categories depending on the impact parameter @xmath3 . in the first category ,",
    "@xmath2 collisions occur with geometrical overlap of the colliding proton and nucleus , where the impact parameter is smaller than the sum of the radii of each particle , namely , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the radius of the proton and nucleus , respectively . )    in the second category instead , the impact parameter exceeds the sum of the two radii , @xmath7 , thus there is no geometrical overlap between the colliding hadrons and hadronic interactions are strongly suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , virtual photons emitted from one of the two colliding hadrons may anyway interact with another hadron .",
    "this process is usually referred to as ultra - peripheral collision ( upc , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "upcs , so far , have been used for the determination of the gluon distribution in protons and nuclei .",
    "for example , photoproduction of quarkonium in ultra - peripheral @xmath2 collisions can probe a high , or possibly saturated , parton density in protons at small bjorken-@xmath8 ( i.e. , small parton momentum fraction of the momentum of protons ) .",
    "indeed measurements already exist of exclusive @xmath9 photoproduction at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , namely , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "conversely , less attention has been paid , in upcs , to particle production in general photon  proton interactions , i.e. , @xmath11 , but nevertheless such particle production should be considered as well in the investigation of collective nuclear effects .",
    "because a large cross section is expected , this process in upcs provides significant background events to pure @xmath2 inelastic interaction events ( hereafter `` hadronic interaction '' , unless otherwise noted ) used for such investigations .",
    "indeed , a sizable cross section was found for hadron production in ultra - peripheral @xmath12 collisions  @xcite , which amounted to @xmath13 of the @xmath12 inelastic cross section .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , only the cross section for upcs was presented , and the discussion of the rapidity and momentum distributions of the upc induced events was unfortunately neglected .    in this paper , we discuss the effects of particle production by @xmath14 interaction in ultra - peripheral @xmath2 collisions compared to the measurements of hadronic interactions in terms of the rapidity and momentum distributions , especially in forward rapidity regions at the lhc and the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . concerning @xmath0 collisions at @xmath15 at the lhc , we perform the calculations assuming that the measurements of @xmath16s and neutrons are made with zero - degree calorimeters ( zdcs , for example , the atlas - zdcs  @xcite ) and the lhcf detector  @xcite , which are capable of investigating nuclear effects using hadronic interaction events in the very forward region . for the case at rhic",
    ", we consider the @xmath16 and neutron measurements in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath17 in the year 2015 .",
    "the star and phenix experiments propose a study on partonic processes in nuclei using forward prompt photons , where decay photons from @xmath16s ( from both the hadronic interaction and upcs ) would be the dominant background events  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , measurements of the hadronic - interaction - induced prompt photons and @xmath16s in transversely polarized @xmath1 collisions may provide key information on the yet unestablished contributions of sivers and collins effects to the single spin asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "our quantitative discussions on forward hadron production are based on monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the mc simulation for upcs consists of two steps ; the virtual photon flux is simulated by the starlight event generator  @xcite and then the subsequent particle production in @xmath14 interactions is simulated by the sophia  @xcite , dpmjet  @xcite , and pythia  @xcite event generators .",
    "starlight in this study has been partially customized in order to transfer the information on the simulated virtual photon to sophia .",

    "conclusions are drawn in the last section . in this",
    "paper natural units @xmath18 are used throughout .",
    "as stated above , the mc simulation for upcs in this study consists of two steps .",
    "first , we simulate the virtual photon flux as a function of the photon energy and impact parameter by using starlight  @xcite .",
    "next , the simulation of the @xmath14 interaction is performed by using sophia  @xcite at low energy and either dpmjet  @xcite or pythia  @xcite at high energy .",

    "the energy spectrum of the virtual photons emitted by the relativistic nucleus follows the weizscker - williams approximation  @xcite implemented in starlight .",
    "the double differential photon flux due to the fast moving nucleus with velocity @xmath19 is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of the emitted photons , @xmath22 is the photon energy , @xmath23 is the electric charge ( @xmath24 for pb and @xmath25 for au ) , @xmath26 is the fine structure constant , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the lorentz factor ) , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the modified bessel functions . in the case of a relativistic nucleus ( @xmath31 ) , the contribution of the term @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : doublediff ] ) can be safely disregarded , and in fact starlight considers only the term @xmath33 . for heavy nuclei with a large radius , the virtuality of the photon @xmath34 can be neglected .",
    "thus all photons are treated as real photons in the simulation for this analysis .",
    "another approximation is due to the fact that here we assume a point charge for the nucleus and this assumptions may lead to a certain level of systematic uncertainty .",
    "for example , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the photon flux in reality depends on the choice of the form factor in the nucleus by @xmath35 .",

    "the non - diffractive interaction , which is implemented using the dual parton model  @xcite , starts to dominate at @xmath57 increasing with energy .",

    "the sophia generator is used for the upc simulations , with the photon energy ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath58 is a `` technical '' cut off energy that distinguishes low energy from high - energy interactions for sophia and the other generators .    here",
    "we emphasize that , firstly , the simulation with the photon energy @xmath59 is crucial for producing low transverse - momentum ( @xmath60 ) upc induced events that are dominant in the very forward regions of the detector reference frame ( explained in sect .",

    "the factor of 2 comes from  @xmath79 .",
    "now , to have a comparison with @xmath71 , we have also calculated the cross section @xmath80 for upcs where a photon emitted by a fast moving proton interacts with a nucleus @xmath81 ( @xmath81 is either pb or au ) , although this process is not taken into account in the mc simulations performed for this study . in ultra - peripheral @xmath2 collisions ,",
    "the number of photons emitted by the proton is generally smaller than that by the nucleus due to the @xmath82 dependence .",
    "the interactions of a single real photon with a nucleus can be roughly classified into two categories in terms of the photon energy in the nucleus rest frame , namely below or above the photopion production threshold . for @xmath83 , thus below the photopion production threshold , the cross sections for photonuclear absorption processes are studied for pb and au nuclei in ref .",

    "the suppression of @xmath87 relative to @xmath89 appears at @xmath90 because of nuclear shadowing  @xcite .",
    "consequently , in ultra - peripheral @xmath1 and @xmath0 collisions , the process with photon emission from the proton is suppressed with respect to that from the nucleus .",
    "the cross section of the former process ( @xmath80 ) amounts to @xmath91 of the latter ( @xmath92 ) .    since the upc simulations used in this paper assume that only a single photon is produced from the moving nucleus in any event , upcs involving two or more photons are not taken into account in the study .",
    "however upc processes with the exchange of two photons between the proton and the nucleus generally have a huge cross section .",
    "in particular , the two - photon exchange leading to di - electrons has a cross section @xmath93 of @xmath94 at the lhc and of @xmath95 at rhic ( @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the electric charges of the proton and nucleus , respectively ) .",

    "conversely , particle production in upcs is clearly clustered around positive forward rapidities , since the upc induced events in this study are produced only by the interactions of the photon emitted from the nucleus with the proton .",
    "it should be noted that the cross sections for upcs exceed those of hadronic inelastic interactions for charged and neutral particles at @xmath113 at the lhc and @xmath114 at rhic .",

    "[ fig : lhc ] for the lhc and in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhic ] for rhic . for the distributions at the lhc , we chose rapidity regions in the detector reference frame @xmath117 for @xmath16s and @xmath118 for neutrons , which roughly correspond to the acceptances of the atlas - zdcs  @xcite and lhcf detector  @xcite .",
    "these detectors provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of high parton density on forward @xmath16s and neutrons , which emerge as a suppression in the momentum distributions in @xmath0 inelastic interactions relative to that of @xmath119 inelastic interactions .    in the upper left and bottom left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] , the @xmath60 distributions of @xmath16s and neutrons in upcs show a steep peak at @xmath120 .",
    "these peaks originate from the @xmath121 and @xmath122 channels , via baryon resonances .",
    "in fact , in the proton rest frame the @xmath14 interactions , with a photon energy ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath123 , have a center - of - mass energy of @xmath124 and thus occur in the baryon resonance region , which has a larger cross section compared to other energy regions .",
    "conversely , the @xmath14 interactions with higher photon energies are suppressed due to a decrease in the photon flux with increasing photon energy .",
    "therefore the @xmath16s and neutrons emitted by the decay of the baryon resonances due to low - energy @xmath14 interactions ( dominantly @xmath125 ) which typically have @xmath120 provide substantial contributions to the @xmath60 distributions of each particle .",

    "the dominance of the @xmath126 channel in upcs is also evident in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] .",
    "forward neutrons produced in upcs have a larger @xmath115 value ; low momentum neutrons produced by a low - energy @xmath14 interaction in the proton rest frame are boosted to nearly the same velocity of the projectile proton .",

    "we chose the rapidity regions @xmath127 for @xmath16s and @xmath128 for neutrons , which correspond to the acceptance of the mpc - ex detector  @xcite and zdc  @xcite of the phenix experiment respectively .",
    "since these rapidity regions are near the acceptance of the fms+pre - shower detector  @xcite and zdc  @xcite of the star experiment , the following discussion is essentially applicable also to measurements performed at the star experiment .",
    "the prompt photon measurements in @xmath1 collisions with the mpc - ex detector in phenix and the fms+pre - shower detector in star could provide key information on partonic processes in the au nucleus , whereas photons from @xmath16s decays , produced both from hadronic interactions and upcs , could be the dominant background events .",
    "the @xmath60 distributions of @xmath16s from upcs have almost the same shapes as those coming from hadronic interactions ( the upper left panel ) , while the absolute yield is at most @xmath129 of that of hadronic interactions .",
    "thus , we conclude that upcs provide a negligible contribution to the amount of @xmath16s giving background photon events .",
    "the @xmath115 distribution of @xmath16s from upcs ( the upper right panel ) is slightly steeper than for hadronic interactions , but the absolute yield is once again negligible . on the other hand , neutrons produced in upcs compete with those from hadronic interactions at @xmath130 .",
    "this can be explained by the same mechanism found in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] , namely dominance of the @xmath131 channel via baryon resonances in upcs .",
    "the @xmath115 distribution of neutrons has a similar shape to that shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",

    "concerning the measurements of forward prompt photons , @xmath16s , and neutrons in polarized @xmath1 collisions , which are sensitive to the origin of spin asymmetry  @xcite , we confirm that the upc contribution to the total number of prompt photons and @xmath16s is negligible , while neutrons instead , are produced in similar amounts from both upcs and hadronic interactions .",
    "we need to test now , both for the lhc and rhic simulations , a possible dependence of the @xmath60 and @xmath115 distributions on the cut off energy @xmath58 that was introduced in sect .  [",
    "sec : lowe ] and [ sec : highe ] .",
    "the comparison of the two distributions at the lhc , with one based on the upc simulations with dpmjet above @xmath132 and the other based on the upc simulations with dpmjet above @xmath133 , shows a negligible difference between these two .",
    "the comparison in the rhic case shows larger differences than at lhc ; nevertheless they are at the same level of those between dpmjet and pythia .",
    "there is also a significant difference for the @xmath60 distributions of neutrons at the lhc between dpmjet and pythia ( the bottom left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : lhc ] ) ; pythia predicts a harder spectrum and has @xmath134 times larger number of neutrons at @xmath135 than dpmjet .",
    "this difference is mostly caused by a strong dependence of the multiplicity of leading baryons on the minimum @xmath60 ( @xmath136 ) for the multiple interactions ( i.e. , hard scattering ) implemented by each model . in general , a lower @xmath136 provides more multiple interactions in an event which then leads to a higher multiplicity . changing the @xmath136 value in pythia ( ` parp(81 ) ` , as a default ) to the default value of dpmjet ( ) significantly modifies the @xmath60 distribution in pythia bringing an overall agreement between the two .",
    "looking back at table  [ tbl : crosssection ] we see that the effective cross sections for @xmath16 and neutron productions are defined as the cross sections having at least one @xmath16 or neutron hitting within the rapidity ranges highlighted above .",
    "we find that upc cross sections are similar or larger than the hadronic cross sections , except for the @xmath16 one at rhic .",
    "it should be noted that the effective cross section estimation involves simulations of specific hadron productions and is thus no longer independent of the generators used for hadronic interactions .",
    "the values in table  [ tbl : crosssection ] for upcs are calculated by using starlight , sophia , and dpmjet , and those for hadronic interactions are calculated by using dpmjet .",
    "nevertheless , the essence of our conclusions will not depend on the choice of event generators .",
    "finally , we roughly estimate the contribution to upcs where the proton acts as the photon source , which was not taken into account in the mc simulation of this paper , and the possible changes to the @xmath60 and @xmath115 distributions . because of the directions of the colliding photon and nucleus and because of the smaller cross sections ( calculated in sect .",
    "[ sec : crosssection ] ) , the number of @xmath16s and neutrons produced at @xmath137 is negligible compared with that from upcs where the nucleus acts as the photon source .",
    "conversely , the two - photon exchange process followed by the @xmath14 interaction , currently not implemented in the mc simulation as well , would yield @xmath16s and neutrons at positive forward rapidities amounting to @xmath108 of those shown in fig .",

    "first , we investigate the effects of requiring some activities in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "the following cuts are applied to inclusive @xmath16 and neutron measurements to eliminate upc induced events as well as to ensure that the hadronic interaction events remain unchanged : ( 1 ) the number of charged particles should be greater than 2 , ( 2 ) the charged particles should have @xmath138 , and ( 3 ) the charged particles should have rapidity @xmath139 at the lhc and @xmath140 at rhic .",
    "the rapidity regions used in the cuts correspond to the rapidity ranges of the atlas and phenix inner detectors  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bgcut1 ] shows the @xmath60 distributions after the cuts at the lhc and rhic .",
    "the absolute yields of upcs at the lhc ( rhic ) are reduced to less than @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) for @xmath16s and @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) for neutrons , even though the absolute yields of hadronic interactions are kept to be larger than , at most , @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) for @xmath16 s and @xmath145 ( @xmath73 ) for neutrons .",
    "thus these cuts on the charged particles at mid - rapidity reduce the relative yields of upcs to hadronic interactions by , at most , @xmath108 ( @xmath147 ) for @xmath16s and @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) for neutrons .",
    "however the cuts still leave a remnant contribution from upcs and unavoidably reduce hadronic interaction events .",
    "it should also be noted that the rejected hadronic interaction events are mostly single and double diffractive events , generally characterized by a small number of charged particles at mid - rapidity , and that the reduction efficiency of @xmath150 highly depends on forward @xmath16 and neutron energies .",
    "next , we test sharper cuts , which require an activity in the negative very forward region , i.e. , the direction of the nucleus remnant , and which can be tagged by a zdc . in this rapidity region , only hadronic interactions produce a large number of spectator nucleons fragmented from the colliding nucleus .",
    "each nucleon has an approximate energy of at the lhc and at rhic .",
    "the cuts applied to the simulated events consist of three requirements : ( 1 ) the number of neutrons should be greater than 1 ( note that a proton can be swept away by the magnets located between an interaction point and a detection point , and thus no proton reaches the detector ) , ( 2 ) the neutrons should have @xmath151 at the lhc and @xmath152 at rhic , and ( 3 ) the neutrons should have a rapidity @xmath153 .",
    "the rapidity region @xmath153 roughly corresponds to the acceptance of the zdc located in the nucleus - going side . as was inferred in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapidity ] , we find that the contribution of upcs is efficiently eliminated by these cuts , keeping the number of hadronic interactions unchanged .    we conclude that a reduction in the contributions from upcs to the measurements of forward hadrons is certainly feasible by requiring some activity in mid and forward rapidity regions . in particular , we expect a strong reduction if we detect spectator nucleons , for example , with a zdc , at negative rapidity @xmath154 .",
    "spectra for @xmath16s and neutrons with the cuts applied at the lhc and rhic ( see text in detail ) .",
    "the solid curves and dashed curves indicate the upc simulation events generated by using starlight+sophia+dpmjet and starlight+sophia+pythia , respectively .",
    "the dotted curves indicate the simulated @xmath2 inelastic events with dpmjet.,width=321 ]",
    "hadron production in forward rapidity regions by ultra - peripheral @xmath0 collisions at the lhc and @xmath1 collisions at rhic was discussed .",
    "the present paper was based on mc simulations of the interaction of virtual photons emitted by a fast moving nucleus with a proton , by using several event generators : starlight , sophia , dpmjet , and pythia .",
    "starlight in this paper was customized in order to transfer the information on the simulated virtual photon to sophia and to receive the information on the produced particles from sophia .",
    "this modification made possible the simulation of upc induced events starting from the photopion production threshold .",
    "we found large cross sections for @xmath16 and neutron productions in the very forward region , leading to a substantial background contribution to the measurements of hadronic interactions at both the lhc and rhic .",
    "therefore , the presence of upcs had to be taken into account in the analyses focused on the investigation of collective nuclear effects and spin physics , in order to correctly evaluate the fraction of the hadronic cross section relative to the measured cross section .",
    "we propose two types of cuts to reduce the fraction of upcs relative to hadronic interactions ; one requires the presence of charged particles at mid - rapidity , while the other requires the presence of spectator neutrons at negative very forward rapidity .",
    "the former cut certainly reduces the upc induced events while unavoidably rejecting some hadronic events .",
    "the second cut efficiently eliminates a fraction of forward @xmath16s and neutrons produced by upcs and does not change the number of hadronic interaction events .",
    "the proposed methods in this paper were simply based on a tracking detector and a zdc and thus are generally applicable to the measurements in other experiments that have a similar detector design .",
    "the author would like to thank the authors of starlight , sophia , pythia , dpmjet , and crmc for providing the codes of their event generators .",
    "the author is also grateful to + r. dalessandro , k. kasahara , y. muraki , and t. sako for the useful comments and discussions regarding this topic .",
    "the author is supported by the postdoctoral fellowships for research abroad , japan society for the promotion of science .",
