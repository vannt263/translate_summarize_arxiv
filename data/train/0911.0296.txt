    "different regimes of the qcd phase diagram can be explored by employing various theoretical methods .",
    "lattice qcd simulations are applicable at zero or imaginary chemical potentials .",
    "most simulations for @xmath0-flavor qcd agree that chiral symmetry is restored by a smooth crossover transition at @xmath1  @xcite but there is still an ongoing discussion concerning the ( pseudo)critical temperatures  @xcite . at finite real chemical potentials",
    "the fermion sign problem remains a considerable obstacle .",
    "several extrapolation techniques to finite chemical potentials such as the reweighting method , imaginary chemical potential or a taylor expansion around vanishing chemical potentials have been proposed ( for an overview see  @xcite ) .",
    "effective models , such as the polyakov - loop njl ( pnjl ) or the polyakov - loop quark - meson ( pqm ) model  @xcite , incorporate important fundamental symmetries and the symmetry breaking pattern of the underlying qcd but do not suffer from the sign problem , large quark masses or finite volume restrictions . furthermore , these type of models can be used to test certain lattice extrapolation techniques to finite @xmath2 . for this purpose",
    "the reproduction of the lattice data for vanishing @xmath2 is a basic prerequisite .    in this talk",

    "based on a novel differentiation technique , higher derivatives of the thermodynamic potential can be calculated very precisely @xcite .",
    "this method allows to investigate convergence properties of the taylor expansion method used on the lattice .",
    "the polyakov - quark - meson ( pqm ) model for three quark flavors is based on the linear @xmath5-model with quarks  @xcite and incorporates in addition the polyakov loop field @xmath6 .",
    "the polyakov loop is the thermal expectation value of a color traced wilson loop in the temporal direction . in the heavy - quark limit",
    "@xmath7 serves as an order parameter for the confinement / deconfinement transition . in the deconfined high - temperature phase the center symmetry @xmath8 of qcd",
    "is spontaneously broken and as a consequence @xmath7 is finite . however , with dynamical quarks the center symmetry is always broken and @xmath7 as an order parameter becomes questionable .",
    "the pqm lagrangian consists of a quark - meson contribution and a polyakov - loop potential @xmath9 , which depends on @xmath7 and its hermitian conjugate @xmath10 .",
    "the uniform temporal background gauge field is coupled to the quarks by replacing the standard derivative @xmath11 in the quark contribution by a covariant derivative @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",

    "the simplest choice is based on a ginzburg - landau ansatz @xcite : @xmath25 the cubic @xmath7 terms are required to break the @xmath26 symmetry of the remaining terms down to the center symmetry , @xmath8 .",
    "the potential parameters are adjusted to the pure gauge lattice data such that the equation of state and the polyakov loop expectation values at finite temperature are reproduced .",

    ". the parameters also result in a first - order transition at @xmath33 in the pure gauge sector but are not fitted to lattice data .",
    "this potential excludes contributions of the unconfined transverse gluons to the equation of state which are relevant at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this is important for the comparison to lattice data at higher temperatures .      for three quark flavors",
    "the grand potential @xmath34 is a function of the temperature and in general three quark chemical potentials , one for each flavor .",
    "here we focus on a uniform quark chemical potential @xmath35 . since we consider the isospin - symmetric case with @xmath36 , only two order parameters , the non - strange @xmath37 and strange @xmath38 emerge  @xcite . the thermodynamic potential in mean - field consists of three different contributions  @xcite : the mesonic part @xmath39 , a quark part @xmath40 and the polyakov loop potential @xmath41 the mesonic contribution has six parameters which are fitted to the vacuum .",
    "for example , the yukawa coupling @xmath16 is fixed to reproduce a light constituent quark mass of @xmath42 mev .",
    "this then yields a strange constituent quark mass of @xmath43 mev .",
    "the temperature- and quark chemical potential dependence of the four order parameters for the chiral and confinement / deconfinement transition are determined as solutions of the corresponding gap equations .",
    "these coupled equations are obtained by minimizing the grand potential , , with respect to the four constant mean - fields @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 labels the global minimum .",
    "in order to compare our model results with recent hotqcd lattice findings  @xcite we have chosen a model parameter setup where the chiral and deconfinement transition temperature coincide at @xmath1 . this is the case for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for all used polyakov - loop potentials  @xcite .",
    "a coincidence of both transitions around @xmath52 is also observed in the corresponding lattice simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , on the lattice a ratio of the physical strange quark mass to the light one of 10 has been used which yields finally too heavy light - quark masses . for a proper comparison",
    "we have therefore adjusted the pion and kaon masses in the model calculations accordingly and use also @xmath53 and @xmath54 . of course ,",
    "heavier meson masses yield also slightly heavier constituent quark masses @xmath55 as a consequence , higher transition temperatures , in particular for the chiral transition in the light sector , are found . but both transitions , the non - strange chiral and the deconfinement one , still coincide .",
    "the strange quark sector is almost unaffected  @xcite .    in the model calculations",
    "all thermodynamic quantities are extracted from the grand potential .",
    "the pressure @xmath56 is directly related to the thermodynamic potential with a suitable normalization , @xmath57 . in the pressure , normalized to the stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) value of the pqm model , is compared to the lattice data and a quark - meson ( qm ) model calculation . as expected",
    ", the qm model  @xcite fails in describing the lattice data , while the pqm model results are in better agreement with the data .",
    "the best agreement is achieved with fukushima s potential where the different treatment of the transverse gluons at higher temperatures is apparent . around the transition",
    "the model versions with the polynomial or logarithmic polyakov loop potential are closer to the lattice data . for physical meson masses ( dashed lines )",
    "the pressure is smaller .",
    "the interaction measure , @xmath58 , indicates the breaking of scale invariance and is given as a temperature derivative of the grand potential @xmath59 in lattice simulations , this quantity can be obtained directly from the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath60 it is more sensitive to finite volume and discretization effects than , e.g. , the pressure ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which is displayed in . in the chirally broken phase ,",
    "the lattice data are close to all model curves . around the transition @xmath61",
    "fukushima s potential is closest to the asqtad - action data , while the remaining two model curves are in better agreement with the p4-action data . in general ,",
    "the peak height decreases on larger lattices , in particular for the p4-action while the asqtad - action shows a weaker @xmath62 dependence @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the pressure , the logarithmic and polynomial polyakov model version do not describe the lattice data in the symmetric phase .",
    "however , fukushima s ansatz approaches the data at least up to @xmath63 .",
    "in addition we also show the energy density @xmath64 and the entropy density @xmath65 , which are defined as @xmath66 in as a function of temperature .",
    "similar to the pressure , fukushima s potential model version comes closest to the lattice data for @xmath67 .",
    "at finite chemical potential the spectrum of the dirac operator becomes complex making direct monte carlo simulations impossible .",
    "several methods have been developed to circumvent this problem and to access at least a region of small chemical potentials in the phase diagram , see e.g.   @xcite .",
    "one such approach is based on the taylor expansion of thermodynamic quantities in powers of @xmath68 around @xmath1 . for the pressure it reads @xmath69 with the coefficients @xmath70 note that only even coefficients contribute since the qcd partition function is cp - symmetric , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "the coefficients have been calculated up to the eighth order by different lattice groups , for @xmath72 see e.g.  @xcite and for @xmath3 quark flavors , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , higher orders still suffer from large errors .",
    "the application of the taylor expansion method to the pqm model provides an opportunity to investigate and test the finite @xmath2 extrapolation since a direct evaluation of the thermodynamic potential in the model is possible .",
    "for example , the location of the critical endpoint ( cep ) is exactly known in the model calculation .",
    "this enables us to distinguish between divergences related to the cep and to the breakdown of the expansion .",
    "however , a further difficulty emerges in the model analysis : in principle , the grand potential is known analytically but an analytic evaluation of the taylor coefficients fails since the implicit temperature and chemical potential dependence of the order parameters is only known numerically via the equations of motion .",
    "standard methods for an evaluation of numerical derivatives are hampered by increasing errors , which become dominant in particular for higher derivative orders . in order to circumvent this caveat",
    "we have developed a novel numerical technique which is based on algorithmic differentiation ( ad ) . with this method",
    "the evaluation of higher derivatives becomes feasible to extremely high precision .",
    "in fact , it is essentially limited only by machine precision .",
    "details of this method can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with this method",
    "we could obtain the taylor coefficients up to @xmath73 order for the pqm model with the logarithmic polyakov loop potential as shown in .",
    "the coefficients are very small far away from the transition temperature and they start to oscillate with increasing amplitude within a narrow temperature range around the transition temperature , i.e.  @xmath74 .",
    "this signals a complex @xmath2 singularity of the thermodynamic potential close to the real axis . in the chiral limit",
    "this singularity would be exactly on the real axis as a reflection of a real phase transition .    by means of the taylor expansion method",
    "it is further possible to study several thermodynamic quantities at small @xmath2 .",
    "one example is the pressure difference @xmath75    in we show @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for various expansion orders in comparison with the model result .",
    "the ratios @xmath79 are slightly below and above the critical value @xmath80 at the cep .",
    "although the transition is still a crossover at @xmath77 , a divergence is observed in the taylor expansion .",
    "the divergence becomes more prominent with increasing orders .",
    "however , a direct model evaluation of the pressure , labeled as pqm in the figure , shows a smooth behavior .",
    "the divergence in the coefficients is clearly a signal for the breakdown of the taylor expansion , which is also related to the oscillations in the coefficients .",
    "this occurs already for @xmath81 and indicates the importance of the higher order coefficients .",
    "for temperatures just below the breakdown at @xmath82 the higher orders improve the observed agreement with the pqm curve .",
    "a similar behavior is also seen for the @xmath83 case . at higher temperatures @xmath84",
    "the coefficients become small again and do not longer contribute . as a consequence",
    "the taylor expansion can again reproduce the pqm result .    for a deeper understanding of the breakdown of the taylor expansion it is instructive to investigate its convergence radius .",
    "it can be obtained from the definition @xmath85 it is not yet known how well the radius @xmath86 is estimated by @xmath87 for a finite value @xmath88 .",
    "the estimated @xmath89 is indicated by the dashed vertical line in .",
    "it coincides with the occurrence of the divergence observed in @xmath76 at @xmath90-th order . from the different @xmath87",
    "we expect that the true convergence radius is smaller than @xmath89 for the given @xmath79 ratios . for more details",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "a detailed study concerning the prospects of locating the cep within the taylor expansion will be given in  @xcite .",
    "in this talk we have presented results for the bulk thermodynamics of a ( @xmath91)-flavor pqm - model with three different effective polyakov loop potentials .",
    "the model parameters are adjusted at vanishing chemical potential to produce a coincidence of the chiral and deconfinement transition for all three polyakov loop potentials . for a better comparison with the recent hotqcd lattice data we further tuned the pion and kaon masses to these values which are used in the lattice simulations .",
    "all three pqm model versions yield a good reproduction of the lattice data for temperatures @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , the taylor expansion of the pressure difference for finite chemical potentials is also investigated . for this purpose",
    ", a novel algorithmic differentiation technique has been developed .",
    "the taylor coefficients up to @xmath93 order could be obtained in the pqm model for the first time .",
    "the knowledge of these higher taylor coefficients allows for a systematic study of convergence properties of the expansion .",
