    "subsystem approaches @xcite are powerful tools in the context of density functional theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , the frozen density embedding ( fde ) theory and its related methods @xcite , emerged in the last years as simple and powerful approaches to treat , in an in principle exact manner , non - covalent complexes @xcite .    within the fde method",
    "the electron density is partitioned into several subsystem s contributions that are constrained to sum up to the total electron density .",
    "the ground - state density is then obtained by minimizing the total energy of the system with respect to one of the subsystem s densities keeping the other ones fixed ( i.e. , frozen ) . in this way , in principle , the full solution of the hohenberg - kohn variational problem @xcite is obtained .",
    "if auxiliary orbitals are introduced to expand the electron density , the fde problem can be recast into the familiar framework of the kohn - sham ( ks ) method @xcite . in this case the ground - state solution is given by a set of coupled ks equations with constrained electron density ( ksced ) @xcite .",
    "the partition of the density , which is at the base of the fde procedure , is in principle arbitrary and any convenient choice can be made for the system under examination .",
    "however , the actual formalism of the fde theory , both in the orbital - free and the orbital - based formulation , is founded on a pure - state representation of the electron densities . therefore , only subsystem densities with integer number of electrons are allowed .",
    "the integer occupation of subsystems limits the choice of possible frozen densities and , in addition , has important consequences from a more formal point of view .",
    "in fact , non - integer particle numbers have been shown to be of extreme importance for the deep comprehension and the development of density functional theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , we mention the fact that the use of non - integer numbers of particles is intrinsically related to the fundamental issue of the derivative discontinuity of density functional theory @xcite and stands at the basis of all definitions in chemical reactivity theory @xcite . in addition , concerning this latter aspect , ref .",
    "@xcite showed the importance of both non - integer occupations and environmental effects for a proper definition of chemical descriptors .",
    "thus , in order to be able to have deep insight into the fundamental properties of the embedding potential or access chemical reactivity descriptors for the embedded subsystems via the fde approach , it is necessary to have a proper fde theory for non - integer particle numbers .",
    "we acknowledge that other embedding theories exist where non - integer particle numbers are allowed @xcite .",
    "namely , the partition density - functional theory ( pdft ) @xcite and the potential - functional embedding theory of huang and carter @xcite .",
    "the latter is not a density - based theory , since the total electronic energy is formulated as a functional of the embedding potential rather than of the subsystems densities .",
    "moreover , in both cases no frozen density is considered but the solution is found by variational minimization of all the subsystems densities and particle numbers .",
    "thus , the non - integer occupation of a given subsystem can not be considered as a parameter inherent with the chosen partition scheme , as in fde , but it is automatically determined by the self - consistent solution of the embedding problem .",
    "furthermore , we note that the minimization of the total electronic energy with respect to the subsystems occupations may arise some conceptual problems in practical calculations where an approximate density functional is employed for the kinetic energy , because the true and approximate energy functionals may be minimized by different sets of occupation numbers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the fde formalism and consider its extension to non - integer subsystems particle numbers , by considering a zero - temperature grand - canonical ensemble formalism @xcite . the implications of the developed theory are then discussed to highlight the significance of non - integer subsystems particle numbers , especially in approximate embedding calculations .",
    "furthermore , we shortly comment on the relevance of the present approach for the comprehension of the role of the derivative discontinuity in the fde context as well as for the definition of well - posed chemical descriptors for embedded subsystems .",
    "within the levy s constrained search @xcite it is well established that the ground - state energy of any @xmath0-electron system can be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath0 is any integer number , @xmath2 is an @xmath3representable electron density , @xmath4 is an @xmath0-particle wave function yielding the density @xmath2 , @xmath5 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath6 is the electron - electron interaction operator , and @xmath7 is an external potential ( usually the nuclear potential ) .",

    "only @xmath10 was variationally optimized to yield the full ground - state density .",
    "this condition , although it may result advantageous in some situations , leads to the problem of the choice of an optimal @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , even simple choices of @xmath11 turn out to be problematic .",
    "for example , the use of the electron density of the isolated subsystem @xmath23 generally violates the condition @xmath73 in some regions of space @xcite . moreover , if the kohn - sham scheme is used for solution , as it is often the case , the frozen density must satisfy the additional condition that @xmath74 is a @xmath75-representable electron density , that means that it must be the ground - state associated with a ks potential .",
    "this condition is of course very hard to fulfill a priori , because the total density @xmath2 is not known in embedding calculations .",
    "a failure of the frozen @xmath11 to fulfill all the requirements described above , will prevent the embedding calculation to converge to the correct solution .",
    "therefore , it may be preferable instead to determine both @xmath10 and @xmath11 through a variational procedure",

    "note however , that even though the densities are obtained through the solution of the coupled equations ( [ e25 ] ) and ( [ e26 ] ) , we are still left with some arbitrarity in the choice of the subsystem densities .",
    "in fact , in eq .",
    "( [ e24 ] ) there is only a constraint on the total number of electrons , but no restrictions on the individual values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , for any system there exists a family of fully variational exact embedding solutions @xmath10 and @xmath11 which provide exactly the same total ground - state energies and densities .",
    "note that within the fde theory , only the ground - state energy and density of the total system are meaningful , while the subsystems densities and energies are , in principle , not well ( and uniquely ) defined , unlike in pdft@xcite .      in practical applications of the kohn - sham method the exchange - correlation ( xc )",
    "energy ( and the corresponding potential ) need to be approximated , because the exact form of this term is not known . in the present paper and in most fde applications",
    "only local / semilocal xc approximations are considered .",
    "these suffice in fact for various applications @xcite .",
    "moreover , they display an explicit dependence from the electron density . with this choice ,",
    "the xc part of the embedding potential can be computed on the same level as the xc potential of the full ks calculation and no additional approximation is needed in the embedding calculations ( for our purposes we can assume the xc approximation is used from the beginning in the construction of the hohenberg - kohn universal functional of eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) ) .    on the other hand , the non - interacting kinetic energy is treated exactly within the ks scheme , but",
    "it needs to be approximated in the embedding potential , since in this latter case we can not make use of auxiliary orbitals for the total embedded system , but rather require an explicitly density - dependent functional ( we remark that an alternative strategy based on the explicit construction of the kinetic potential using the numerical inversion procedures also exists @xcite , but is not applicable in practical calculations ) .",
    "thus , local or semilocal approximations are introduced for the non - additive kinetic energy in any practical calculation based on the frozen density embedding method .",
    "this approximation is the only source of errors in semilocal embedding calculations , when compared with the corresponding ks results for the whole system .",
    "the inclusion of approximations in the embedding procedure has important consequences on the outcome of the embedding calculations @xcite .",
    "the first , of course , is that the true ground - state energy and density can not be recovered any more because eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) ( or ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e23 ] ) ) minimize different functionals .",
    "more importantly , the final result of the embedding calculation is no more independent on the choice of the `` frozen '' density @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , while for the exact kinetic energy the functional in eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) is truly dependent only on the sum @xmath81 , so that it will yield always the same result whenever the sum is left unchanged , for approximate kinetic energy functionals the functional of eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) really depends on @xmath10 and @xmath11 separately and will likely provide different results for different choices of @xmath11 .",

    "the second result that can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) is that the difference between the errors on the embedding density computed at two different ( small ) values of the fractional charge @xmath110 and @xmath111 is roughly proportional to @xmath112 ( see fig .",

    "finally , we see that in order to minimize the error on the embedding density the @xmath114 and @xmath115 terms must cancel each other ( unless they are both zero , which however brings back to the exact embedding case ) .",
    "this situation is likely to occur if @xmath116 ( the relaxation term is in general rather small ) .",
    "thus , the error will be minimized if the error @xmath114 is dominated by a ( small ) charge - transfer of @xmath33 electrons from the subsystem a to the subsystem b. this suggests that the error on the embedding density is minimized by non - zero values of @xmath33 for charge - transfer complexes , whereas it is minimum close to @xmath106 for other types of non - covalent complexes ( e.g. hydrogen bond , dipole - dipole , or dispersion complexes ) .",

    "in particular , the fact that a small hardness corresponds to the possibility to easy add or remove charge from the ( embedded ) system , whereas a high hardness implies the opposite . equations ( [ hard ] ) include into the hardness of each subsystem the environmental effects ( due to the other subsystem ) , thus they provide an indicator for the possibility that a component of a complex may interact with a third system ( e.g. , we can obtain the hardness of an acidic complex when solvated and compare it to that of a basic complex immersed in the same solution ) .",
