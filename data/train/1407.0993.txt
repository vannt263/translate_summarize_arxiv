    "in the past two decades , there has been impressive progress in our understanding of the cosmological history of the universe .",
    "a variety of precision measurements and observations point to a specific sequence of major cosmological events : inflation , baryogenesis , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , recombination and the decoupling of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "while our knowledge of inflation and baryogenesis , likely linked to the earliest moments in the universe , is necessarily more uncertain , bbn and the cmb have a firm position in cosmic chronology .",
    "this by itself puts many models of particle physics to a stringent test , as the increasing precision of cosmological data leaves less and less room for deviations from the minimal scenario of standard cosmology . in this paper",
    ", we adhere to the standard cosmological model , taking as given the above sequence of the main cosmological events .",
    "thus we assume that the universe emerged from the last stage of inflation and baryogenesis well before the onset of bbn .",
    "these minimal assumptions will allow us to set stringent bounds on very weakly interacting sectors of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "neutral hidden sectors , weakly coupled to the standard model , are an intriguing possibility for new physics .",
    "they are motivated on various fronts , e.g. in the form of right - handed neutrinos allowing for neutrino oscillations , or by the need for non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "while the simplest hidden sectors in each case may consist of a single state , various extensions have been explored in recent years , motivated by specific experimental anomalies . in particular , these extensions allow for models of dark matter with enhanced or suppressed interaction rates or sub - weak scale masses .    from a general perspective",
    ", we would expect leading couplings to a neutral hidden sector to arise through relevant and marginal interactions .",
    "there are only three such flavor - universal ` portals ' in the sm : the relevant interaction of the higgs with a scalar operator @xmath3 ; the right - handed neutrino coupling @xmath4 ; and the kinetic mixing of a new u(1 ) vector @xmath5 with hypercharge @xmath6 . of these ,",
    "the latter vector portal is of particular interest as it leads to bilinear mixing with the photon and thus is experimentally testable , and at the same time allows for a vector which is naturally light .",
    "this portal has been actively studied in recent years , particularly in the ` dark force ' regime in which the vector is a loop factor lighter than the weak scale , @xmath7  mev  gev @xcite .",
    "the model for this hidden sector is particularly simple .",
    "besides the usual kinetic and mass terms for @xmath8 , the coupling to the sm is given by @xcite _ v = - f",
    "_ v^ = e v_j^_em .",
    "[ lv ] thus all phenomenological consequences of the model , including the production and decay of new vectors , are regulated by just two parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this makes the model a very simple benchmark for all light , weakly interacting , particle searches .",
    "there are , however , options with regard to the origin of the mass of @xmath8 , either a new higgs mechanism , or @xmath1 as a fundamental parameter  the so - called stueckelberg mass . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the latter option for simplicity .",
    "the sm decay channels of @xmath8 are well known . in the mass range where hadronic decays",
    "are important , one can use direct experimental data for the @xmath9-ratio to infer couplings to virtual time - like photons , and hence to determine the decay rate @xmath10 and all the branching ratios . in a wide mass range from @xmath11 mev",
    ", the vector @xmath8 decays purely to electron - positron pairs with lifetime [ lifetime ] _",
    "v = 610 ^ 5 yr where we have introduced the effective electromagnetic fine structure constant , absorbing the square of the mixing angle into its definition , _ eff ^2 .",
    "importantly , we assume no light hidden sector states @xmath12 charged under u(1 ) , so that there are no  dark decays \" of @xmath13 that would erode the visible modes and shorten the lifetime of @xmath8 .",
    "the normalization of the various quantities in ( [ lifetime ] ) roughly identifies the region of interest in the @xmath14 parameter space for this paper .",
    "we will explore the cosmological consequences of these hidden u(1 ) vectors with masses in the mev - gev range , and lifetimes long enough for the decay products to directly influence the physical processes in the universe following bbn , and during the epoch of cmb decoupling .",
    "these vectors have a parametrically small coupling to the electromagnetic current , and thus an extremely small production cross sections for @xmath15 , _",
    "prod ~ ~ 10 ^ -66 - 10 ^ -52   cm^2 , [ prod ] where we took @xmath16 mev and the range is determined by our region of interest , _",
    "^ -38 - 10 ^ -24 .",
    "such small couplings render these vector states completely undetectable in terrestrial particle physics experiments , and consequently we refer to them as _ very dark photons _ ( vdp ) .",
    "as follows from the expression ( [ lifetime ] ) for the lifetime , the lower limit of the above range for @xmath17 is relevant for cmb physics , while the upper limit is important for bbn .",
    "the production cross section ( [ prod ] ) looks prohibitively small , but in the early universe at @xmath18 every particle in the primordial plasma has the right energy to emit @xmath8 s .",
    "the cumulative effect of early universe production at these temperatures , followed by decays at @xmath19 , can still inject a detectable amount of electromagnetic energy .",
    "a simple parametric estimate for the electromagnetic energy release per baryon , omitting @xmath20 factors , takes the form @xmath21 here the production rate per unit volume , @xmath22 , was taken to be the product of the typical number density of particles in the primordial plasma and the @xmath8 decay rate , @xmath23 .",
    "this production rate is active within one hubble time , @xmath24 , leading to the appearance of the planck mass in ( [ estimate ] ) , along with another large factor , the ratio of photon to baryon number densities , @xmath25 .",
    "one observes that the combination of these two factors is capable of overcoming the extreme suppression by @xmath26 .",
    "given that bbn can be sensitive to an energy release as low as @xmath27 per baryon , and that the cmb anisotropy spectrum allows us to probe sub - ev energy injection , we reach the conclusion that the early universe can be an effective probe of vdp ! the cosmological signatures of the decaying vdp were partially explored in @xcite , but to our knowledge the cmb constraints on this model were not previously studied .",
    "in the remainder of this paper , we provide detailed calculations to delineate the vdp parameter regions that are constrained by bbn and cmb data . in the process",
    ", we provide in section  2 an improved calculation of the ` freeze - in ' abundance in the early universe ( using some recent insight about the in - medium production of dark vectors @xcite ; see also  @xcite ) . in section  3",
    ", we explore the bbn constraints in more detail , including the speculative possibility that the currently observed over - abundance of @xmath28li can be reduced via vdp decays .",
    "then in section  4 we consider the impact of even later decays on the cmb anisotropies .",
    "a summary of the constraints we obtain in shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sum ] , and more detailed plots of the parameter space are shown in sections  3 and 4 .",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks in section  5 .",
    "several appendices contain additional calculational details .",
    "the cosmological abundance of long - lived very dark photons is determined by the freeze - in mechanism . while there are several possible production channels ,",
    "the simplest and most dominant is the inverse decay process .",
    "when quark ( or more generally hadronic ) contributions can be neglected , the inverse decay proceeds via coalescence of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram - eebartov ] .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the total number density of @xmath8 takes the form latexmath:[\\ ] ] at threshold we use the solid black line of fig .",
    "11 of  @xcite and the @xmath8-width is then given by @xmath291     and @xmath292 cross sections up to @xmath293 with our pythia simulation for @xmath294 . in this plot ,",
    "any branching to @xmath79 was neglected .",
    "also shown is the fraction of vector mass that is converted into em - energy , denoted br@xmath295 . ]    away from threshold , we simulate the complex decays of @xmath8 with pythia . in particular , multi - pion(kaon ) production and decays to hyperons and baryonic resonances become relevant .",
    "the yield of phenomenologically relevant final states , @xmath296 , @xmath79 , and nucleons is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pythia ] for @xmath297 .",
    "narrow resonances like @xmath281 are not captured by the resolution of the simulation .",
    "the dots in fig  [ fig : pythia ] show the average electromagnetic energy injected after all particles have decayed to electrons and photons ; @xmath278 are assumed to have annihilated on @xmath279 .",
    "one can see that to a significant fraction of the energy is carried away by neutrinos .    at lower energies , even though the pythia simulation is not available , the topology of the decay events becomes simpler , and is eventually dominated by two body decays . above the di - pion ( di - kaon ) threshold , we therefore use babar precision measurements of the @xmath298 and @xmath292",
    "cross section until an energy @xmath299 . above that energy",
    "we stitch the data together with our simulation above , expecting to capture the overall importance of various final states qualitatively correctly .",
    "the resulting effective effective branching ratios that are relevant for bbn considerations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdec ] . for simplicity , and as alluded to above , we neglect the @xmath79 contribution . also shown is the fraction of vector mass that is converted into em - energy in the hadronic decay , denoted by br@xmath300 .",
