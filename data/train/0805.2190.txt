    "transient chaotic motion is typical in systems with leaks and in naturally open systems showing chaotic scattering  @xcite .",
    "the escape of trajectories that remain a long time inside the system is governed by an invariant , nonattracting , chaotic set  @xcite .",

    "the stable ( unstable ) manifold of this set is defined by all points that lead to this set in forward ( backward ) time .",
    "the term _ chaotic repeller _ is sometimes used to denote this set  @xcite . because billiards have a two dimensional phase space and are time reversible , having therefore stable and unstable manifolds , the term _ chaotic saddle _ ( cs ) is more appropriate  @xcite . for strongly chaotic ergodic systems ,",
    "the cs has zero lebesgue measure @xmath61 ( vanishing area of the phase space ) , and the support of the cs is a fractal set .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds cross orthogonally ( angle bounded from zero ) and are also of zero lebesgue measure .",
    "trajectories that survive for a long time inside the system necessarily have initial conditions close to the stable manifold of the cs , approach closely the cs , and leave the system through the unstable manifold of the cs .",
    "a well defined escape rate  @xmath6 exists which is independent of the density of initial conditions  @xmath62 , provided the support of  @xmath62 intersects the stable manifold of the cs .",
    "relations between  @xmath6 and the properties of the cs ( fractal dimension along the manifolds , lyapunov exponent ) have previously been derived  @xcite .",
    "let us see now how these results can be adapted to the case of optical cavities , where the leakage is only partial inside  @xmath33 and the dynamics involves not only the map  @xmath14 but also the decay of the intensity  @xmath22 .",
    "a natural definition of the cs is obtained replacing the condition of never escaping trajectories mentioned above by the condition that @xmath63 for all times : @xmath64 in other words , the cs defined eq .",

    "it follows that : cs@xmath65 because escape takes place if @xmath66 .",
    "a definition similar to  ( [ eq.cs1 ] ) is not appropriate for the manifolds of the cs .",
    "for instance , initial condition inside  @xmath33 that converge to the cs for  @xmath67 and still have  @xmath68 clearly deserve to belong to the saddle s stable manifold ( similar argument for  @xmath69 holds for the unstable manifold ) .",
    "the stable ( unstable ) manifold of the cs is therefore defined by _ all _ points @xmath70 cs for  @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , but attached to these points there is a manifold intensity  @xmath22 given by @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this suggests an alternative definition for the cs itself : @xmath75 the cs defined using eq .",

    "therefore , for long times , all rays with nonvanishing intensities inside the cavity will be governed by the cs  ( [ eq.cs1 ] ) and its manifolds .",
    "this justifies the choice of relation  ( [ eq.cs1 ] ) and shows that this cs also governs the energy decay from the billiard .    with the above definitions of the invariant sets ,",
    "let us characterize the escape from the cavity .",
    "the proper measure to describe this decay is the conditionally invariant measure ( c measure ) @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the mathematically well defined c measure is obtained multiplying the survival density by a factor proportional to  @xmath78 that compensates the decay of the lebesgue measure  @xcite .",
    "the conditionally invariant density  @xmath5 concentrates along the unstable manifold of the cs  @xcite and is the only attractor for typical initial densities  @xmath62  @xcite .",

    "typically @xmath54 overestimates  @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that many of the results of the theory of transient chaos presented above have been recently rediscovered in the analysis of optical cavities .",

    "the density  @xmath5 concentrates along the unstable manifold of the cs  @xcite , which presents the characteristic filamentary pattern inside  @xmath33 .",
    "this explains the peaked distribution of the transmitted rays responsible for the emission from the cavity .",
    "when a short time periodic orbit exists close to the critical line  @xmath82 , the unstable manifold of this orbit ( which also belongs to the cs ) will be parallel to the manifold of the remaining part of the cs because both manifolds do not intersect .",
    "this corresponds to the observation by schwefel _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite described as point ( ii ) in the introduction .",
    "the results described so far can be rigorously applied only for a limited class of strongly chaotic systems . it can be argued that it is a technical problem to extend these demonstrations to a larger class of nonuniformly hyperbolic systems , where no deviation of the exponential decay have been numerically detected .",
    "however , cavities with generic boundaries typically have a mixed phase space : coexisting with regions of chaotic motion there are regions of regular motion , e.g. , kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands . around these regions",
    "there is a _ sticky region _",
    "whereto chaotic trajectories get partially trapped , introducing a power - law like decay of the survival probability .",
    "rigorously , the results of the theory of transient chaos mentioned above either do not apply or become trivial . this type of cavities have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and without further justifications it is not clear how the previous results can be extended to this case .    in this section ,",
    "i show how , despite the mathematical difficulties , in practice the formalism of the cs and its manifolds do apply to billiards presenting a divided phase space .",
    "the basic observation is that typically a well defined exponential decay of the survival probability exists for intermediate times , where in practice the previous results can be applied  @xcite .",
    "below , billiards containing a large chaotic component and no kam islands in the border of  @xmath33 are considered . in this case ,",
    "similar to the decay of trajectories , the decay of energy  ( [ eq.energy ] ) from the chaotic component shows a transition from exponential to asymptotic power - law  @xcite @xmath83 where  @xmath41 is proportional to the inverse of the negative lyapunov exponent of the saddle , @xmath84 is the shortest time rays in the sticky region need to reach @xmath33 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the physically relevant time is the crossover time  @xmath86 between the exponential and power - law decays in eq .",

    "it is defined as  @xmath87 , i.e. , for  @xmath3 the power - law decay dominates . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that  @xmath88 and suggested that exponential and power - law regimes in eq .",
    "( [ eq.powerlaw ] ) can be related , respectively , to hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components of the cs , as first suggested in ref .",
    "the nonhyperbolic component consists of the border of kam islands ( and by other marginal stable orbits ) while the hyperbolic part is away from the sticky regions and resembles the cs described in sec .",
    "[ ssec.invariantsets ] .",
    "initial conditions uniformly distributed _ touching _ the kam islands reduces the exponent  @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.powerlaw ] ) by  @xmath90 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . considering this effect , and because  ( [ eq.powerlaw ] ) is a survival probability distribution , typically  @xmath91 .",
    "the exact ( finite time ) value depends on the properties of the nonhyperbolic region ( kam island ) .    in terms of the energy inside the cavity , eq .",
    "( [ eq.powerlaw ] ) indicates that while for  @xmath2 energy concentrates strongly in the hyperbolic component of the cs and its manifolds , for  @xmath3 the energy concentrates in the nonhyperbolic component of the cs close to the kam islands . in principle",
    ", one could expect also a dramatic change in the emission pattern from @xmath2 to  @xmath3 .",
    "however , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , one important difference between the hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components of the cs is that their manifolds attract and repel exponentially and sub - exponentially respectively .",
    "therefore , rays slowly approach and slowly escape the nonhyperbolic component of the cs _ through _ the hyperbolic component .",
    "in particular , when kam islands are away from  @xmath33 , rays that approached kam islands will come close to the stable / unstable manifolds of the _ hyperbolic _ component of the cs before escaping .",
    "more precisely , the unstable manifold of the nonhyperbolic component of the cs aligns to and follows closely the unstable manifold of the hyperbolic component . from this qualitative description",
    "we expect that , even if the energy concentrates for long times  @xmath3 on the nonhyperbolic component of the cs , the decay towards  @xmath33 will not dramatically change from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",

    "a simple and efficient method to obtain a visualization of this zero measure set was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( p. 201 ) .",
    "it is based on the observation that ( most ) trajectories that survive until some long time  @xmath119 were close to the stable manifold of the cs at time @xmath120 , were close to the cs at time  @xmath121 , and were close to the unstable manifold at time  @xmath122 .",
    "this method is expected to work for the hyperbolic component of the cs if  @xmath123 and if initial conditions are selected away from sticky regions , i.e. , _ non - uniformly _ in the chaotic sea .",

    "the relative ( apart from the overall decay ) phase - space distribution of energy at these times are expected to be representative for all times in the exponential and power - law decays ( e.g. , the normalized distribution for  @xmath67 is expected to resemble the one at  @xmath125 ) .",

    "the two figures in the upper row confirm that the energy shifts from the hyperbolic component of the cs and its unstable manifold , to the nonhyperbolic component of the saddle .",
    "the two figures in the bottom row are magnifications of the upper figures in the leak region , which is the relevant region for emission purposes .",
    "the differences between @xmath126 and  @xmath125 are much less dramatic in this case . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig.4](c ) , we see that the energy is non - vanishing along the unstable manifold of the ( hyperbolic component of ) the cs , and only the relative intensity is ( slightly ) changed in time .",
    "these different intensities are enough to change the far - field emission as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] .",
    "an overall similar pattern is observed for both times , but with different intensities at different emission angles .",
    "these results are in agreement with the interpretation at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec.nonh ] that the unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components of the cs are close to each other inside  @xmath33 .",
    "however , the numerical simulations presented here suggests that differences in the intensities inside  @xmath33 lead to far field emissions that are similar but not identical for  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 .",
    "this paper describes the chaotic ray dynamics in dielectric cavities in terms of the theory of transient chaos .",
    "after properly taking into account the partial leakage introduced by fresnel s law , the long time escape and emission are found to be governed by a chaotic saddle ( cs )  @xcite .",
    "the energy inside the cavity is distributed according to the c measure  @xcite , that is non - zero along the unstable manifold of the cs  @xcite . in the generic case of cavities showing mixed phase space , it is useful to consider a division of the cs in hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components  @xcite , related to the exponential ( @xmath2 ) and power - law  ( @xmath3 ) decays of energy inside the cavity . for longer times ( @xmath3 )",
    "the energy concentrates in the nonhyperbolic component of the cs , but the emission shows only small differences from shorter times  ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that , when the nonhyperbolic regions are away from the critical line , the unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components are close to each other inside the leak region .    from the point of view of previous investigations in dielectric cavities",
    ", these results provides an unifying and more general description of experiments and simulations .",
    "for instance , the localization in the far field emission is shown here to be related to the unstable manifold of the cs and not of a single periodic orbit as previously reported , what is expected to be of practical relevance in cases where no simple periodic orbit exists close to the critical line .    from the point of view of dynamical systems",
    "theory , the novel aspects of this paper are twofold : ( i ) it takes the partial leak of optical systems explicitly into account in the definition ( of the unstable manifold ) of the cs ( sec . [ ssec.invariantsets ] ) ; and ( ii ) it shows how systems with mixed phase space can be effectively described ( secs .",
    "[ sec.nonh ] and [ sec.numerics ] ) .",
    "the success of point ( ii ) in the description of physically relevant quantities , such as the intensity of the far field emission , suggests that future works in nonhyperbolic hamiltonian systems should consider in more detail and more rigorously the division of the chaotic saddle in hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components  @xcite .",
    "altogether , it is also interesting to see that many of the fundamental concepts of transient chaos theory ( e.g. , the cs , its unstable manifolds , and c measure ) achieve an experimental concreteness in optical systems .",
    "this is perhaps only comparable to the case of fluid dynamics , where the unstable manifold of the cs can be visually observed in scattering systems , specially when a constant injection or activity of tracers compensate the natural decay through the fluid flow  @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of fluids , experiments and applications in dielectric microcavities are rarely a simple decay of rays that have been excited at some time  @xmath120 , as considered in the model of this paper .",
    "instead , energy is constantly pumped to the system from outside through some gain in the medium .",
    "the relevance of the rays that survive for long time inside the cavity by approaching the cs is that their intensities are enhanced through the input of energy .",
    "accordingly , in the wave picture , the ( high - q ) lasing modes concentrate in the region of the cs  @xcite . the details of these experimental mechanisms , and how they could be included in the ray picture , are beyond the scope of this paper",
    ". however , generally one can think that these different mechanisms translate in a minimum confinement time  @xmath127 , and only rays confined for times @xmath128 are relevant . in this picture , the results of this paper suggest that depending whether @xmath129 or @xmath130 the energy inside the chaotic component of the cavity changes dramatically : it will be concentrated mainly in the hyperbolic ( @xmath129 ) or nonhyperbolic ( @xmath131 ) component of the saddle ( in optical microcavities @xmath132 ) . however , the emission pattern is similar in these two cases because it is determined by the unstable manifold of the cs inside  @xmath33 .",
    "a similar emission pattern is also expected when the relevant modes are _ inside _ the kam islands and tunnel the ( dynamical ) barrier that separates them from the chaotic sea ."
