    "it was shown that by going from 5d to 6d it was possible to trap fields of all spins ( i.e. spins 0 , @xmath0 , 1 , 2 ) to a 4d spacetime using only gravity .",

    "this negative energy density may provide a physical explanation for the formation of the brane : the negative energy density provides a repulsive force which can balance the usual attraction due to gravity .",

    "one final , and important , difference between the thick brane solution of the present section and the analytic solution of the previous section is that the proper distance for the present solution is infinite .",
    "this can be seen directly by calculating the proper length @xmath126 which is infinite . for the analytic solution of the previous section @xmath127 from . using this asymptotic form in",
    "gives a finite proper length .    because the proper length away from the brane is infinite rather than finite  as was the case for the analytic solution of ",
    "we need to revisit the question of whether fields of various spins are trapped or not . for the analytic solution of this question",
    "was investigated in detail in @xcite @xcite and not unsurprisingly all the various spin fields where  trapped \" exactly because the proper length was finite .",
    "the criteria for trapping taken in @xcite @xcite was that the integration of the action for some test field of spin-@xmath128 over the extra dimensions should be finite .",
    "this is the criteria for trapping we take in the present work .",
    "one can also take as the criteria for trapping that total field energy per unit 3-volume of the brane ( i.e. the integral of the energy density , @xmath129 over the extra spatial dimensions ) be finite @xcite . in the present work",
    "these two criteria give the same result in regard to whether or not the field is trapped for all cases we consider .",
    "we now investigate in detail the trapping of a spin-@xmath43 field .",
    "the spin-@xmath130 and spin-@xmath131 cases are identical to the spin-@xmath43 case .",
    "the spin-@xmath132 case can be worked out along the same lines as the other fields using the set - up given in @xcite .",

    "the cases of spin-@xmath130 and spin-@xmath131 fields also yield integral which diverge as @xmath142 .",
    "the spin-@xmath132 case is different in detail but also yields a divergent integral which goes as @xmath143 .",
    "thus none of the fields are trapped by the metric alone . in the next section",
    "we show that the exponential form for the scalar field @xmath46 can give a universal trapping mechanism .    before moving on to the trapping mechanism",
    "we make a few comments about the geometric character of the metric given by figure and by the asymptotic expressions .",
    "the metric solution is a co - dimension 2 object which is asymptotically flat as @xmath44 and has a deficit angle of @xmath144 .",
    "to see this we change the asymptotic form of the metric ( given by inserting in ) via the transformation @xmath145 .",
    "with this the 2d part of the metric becomes @xmath146 for this 2d metric one defines a new angle @xmath147 so that @xmath148 which gives a deficit angle of @xmath144 . since @xmath111 this is a deficit angle rather than a proficit angle .",
    "recently there has been interest in such brane world models with deficit @xcite and proficit @xcite angles to investigate open questions such as the cosmological constant and the fermion generation puzzle .",
    "all the test fields studied in the previous subsections have divergent actions coming from the integration over @xmath23 .",
    "thus none of these fields are trapped to the brane at @xmath1 and as it stands the model is not viable .",
    "however , the form of the scalar field , @xmath46 , provides a mechanism for trapping all the fields studied in the previous subsections . note that all the spin fields have @xmath23 integrals that diverge as some power ( @xmath149 for spin 0 , spin 1 and spin 2 ; @xmath150 for spin @xmath0 ) . on the other hand from one",

    "if ( i ) or ( ii ) is not satisfied then @xmath46 is oscillatory ; if ( ii ) is not satisfied @xmath46 grows exponentially .",
    "for our solution all three conditions are met so @xmath46 decreases exponentially .",
    "since the decrease of @xmath46 is exponential while the divergence of the @xmath23 integration for each of the fields is some power law @xmath154 with @xmath155 one can get the @xmath23 integration to converge by multiplying the lagrangian density of each spin field by some positive power of @xmath46 as @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 . redoing the analysis of the previous subsections it is easy to see that this procedure will make each of the @xmath23 integrations converge thus giving a trapping of the test field .",
    "an even more stringent and less _ ad hoc _ trapping mechanism can be obtained by introducing a dilaton - like exponential coupling as suggested in the seminal paper @xcite @xcite . as in these works",
    "we can introduce an exponential , dilaton - like coupling between @xmath46 and the various spin fields in the following way @xmath159 since @xmath46 exponentially goes to zero the factor @xmath160 will make the @xmath23 integration for each of the various spin test fields strongly convergent . in each case",
    "( spin 0 , @xmath0 , 1 , 2 ) we find the fields are exponentially trapped by the behavior of @xmath46 to some small region near the brane at @xmath1 .",
    "the non - gravitational , trapping mechanism suggested by or is simple and universal .",
    "it is made possible by the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field @xmath46 which plays a dual role of forming the brane and trapping test fields of all spin to the brane .",
    "this mechanism is may be compared in some respects to confinement in quantum chromodynamics or to the confinement of magnetic charges inside a superconductor . particularly in the magnetic charges inside a superconductor example",
    ", the scalar field condensate of cooper pairs plays a crucial role .",
    "we have constructed a thick brane solution in 6d spacetime using two self - interacting , and mutually interacting scalar fields .",
    "this thick brane solution had the same general characteristics as the analytic solution given : the warp factors , @xmath161 were equal to @xmath130 at @xmath1 so that on the brane one had a 6d minkowski spacetime .",
    "as @xmath44 the warp factor functions approached constant asymptotic values @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the energy densities were also similar  both were negative on the brane and approached some different , asymptotic value as @xmath44 .",
    "two important advantages of the present solution is that the asymptotic value of the energy density in the bulk was zero rather than negative . in both cases",
    "the negative energy density may provide a physical explanation for the formation of the brane  the repulsion from the negative energy density can balance the attraction due to gravity .",
    "another advantage of the present solution is that the energy - momentum tensor for the previous analytic solution was  fixed by hand \" in order to give the warp factors in which provided the universal gravitational trapping of particles / fields of all spins . in the present case",
    "the energy - momentum tensor comes from a more realistic source i.e. two scalar fields .",
    "in essence the two ansatz functions @xmath42 from have been replaced by the two scalar fields @xmath164 .",
    "because the 2d warp factor , @xmath22 , goes to zero as @xmath44 according to a power law with @xmath121 , the proper distance away from the brane is infinite , rather than finite as in the case of the analytic solution in @xcite .",
    "thus we were forced to introduce a new , simple , non  gravitational trapping mechanism for test fields of various spins moving in the background with @xmath161 given by figure .",
    "the mechanism involves multiplying the test field lagrange density for a test field of spin @xmath165 by some positive power of the scalar field @xmath46 as in .",
    "thus @xmath46 not only forms the brane near @xmath1 with an energy density peaked near @xmath1 ( see figure ) and going to zero at @xmath166 , but also is responsible for the trapping of test fields of various spins to the brane .",
    "the brane solution found here is not absolutely stable since it settles into one of the local minima at @xmath96 and @xmath97 rather than one of the global minima at @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "however , the barrier between the local and global minima can be made large by adjusting the parameters the scalar potential .",
    "for example , one could chose different values of @xmath169 . in this way",
    "the decay probability of the present solution from the local minimum to the global minimum via tunneling could be made small .",
    "this would make the brane solution presented here effectively stable over long time scales .",
    "one open question not studied in the present paper is the stability of this solution in the lyapunov sense ( see for example @xcite ) .",
