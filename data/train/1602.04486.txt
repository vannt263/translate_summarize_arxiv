    "asteroid families form as a result of collisions between asteroids .",
    "these events can either lead to a formation of a large crater on the parent body , from which fragments are ejected , or catastrophically disrupt it .",
    "more than 120 families are currently known in the main belt ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2015 ) and the number of their members ranges from several thousands to just a few dozens , for the smaller and compact families .",
    "a lot of progress has been made in the last decades in developing sophisticated impact hydrocodes able to reproduce the main properties of families , mainly accounting for their size distribution , and , in a few cases ( the karin and veritas clusters ) the ejection velocities of their members ( michel et al .",
    "however , while the sizes of asteroids can be either measured directly through radar observations or occultations of stars , or inferred if the geometric albedo of the asteroid is known , correctly assessing ejection velocities is a more demanding task .",
    "the orbital element distribution of family members can , at least in principle , be converted into ejection velocities from gauss equations ( zappal et al .",
    "1996 ) , provided that both the true anomaly and the argument of perihelion of the family parent body are known ( or assumed ) .",
    "orbital elements of family members , however , are not fixed in time , but can be changed by gravitational and non - gravitational effects , such as resonant dynamics ( morbidelli and nesvorn 1999 ) , close encounters with massive asteroids ( carruba et al .",
    "2003 ) , and yarkovsky ( bottke et al . 2001 ) effects , etc . separating which part of the current distribution in proper elements may be caused by the initial velocity field and which is the consequence of later evolution is a quite complex problem .",
    "interested readers are referred to vokrouhlick et al .",
    "( 2006a , b , c ) for a discussion of monte carlo methods applied to the distribution of asteroid families proper semi - major axis .",
    "yet , insights into the distribution of the ejection velocities are valuable for better understanding of the physics of large - scale collisions ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2006 , michel et al .",
    "they may help to calibrate impact hydrocodes , and improve models of the internal structure of asteroids .",
    "here we analyze the inclination distribution of asteroid families .",
    "the proper inclination is the the proper element least affected by dynamical evolution , and it could still bear signs of the original ejection velocity field . we find that a family formed in an event in which the ejection velocities were not much larger than the escape velocity from the parent body should be characterized by a peaked ( leptokurtic ) initial distribution ( relative to a gaussian ) , while families formed in hyper - velocity impacts , such as the case of the eos family ( vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2006a ) , should have either a normal or less peaked ( platykurtic ) distribution .",
    "the subsequent dynamical evolution should then act to bring this initial distribution to appear more gaussian ( or mesokurtic ) .",
    "the relative importance of the subsequent evolution depends on which specific proper element is considered , and on how active the local dynamics is . using the proper inclination we attempt to identify cases where the local dynamics either did not have time or was not effective in erasing the initial , presumably leptokurtic , distributions .",
    "these cases can be used to better understand the conditions immediately after a parent body disruption .",
    "this paper is divided as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : gauss_eq ] , we model the distribution of ejection velocities after a family - forming event .",
    "we explain how a peakedness of an expected distribution can be measured by the pearson kurtosis .",
    "[ sec : kurt_dyn ] shows how dynamics can modify the initial distribution by creating a new distribution that is more gaussian in shape . in sect .",
    "[ sec : kurt_families ] , we survey the known asteroid families , to understand in which cases the traces of the initially leptokurtic distribution can be found .",
    "[ sec : conc ] presents our conclusions .",
    "proper orbital elements can be related to the components of the velocity in infinity , @xmath1 , along the direction of the orbital motion ( @xmath2 ) , in the radial direction ( @xmath3 ) , and perpendicular to the orbital plane ( @xmath0 ) through the gauss equations ( murray and dermott 1999 ) :    @xmath4 , \\label{eq : gauss_1}\\ ] ]    @xmath5 , \\label{eq : gauss_2}\\ ] ]    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 define a reference orbit ( usually the center of an asteroid family , defined in our work as the center of mass in a 3d proper element orbital space  , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the ( generally unknown ) true anomaly and perihelion argument of the disrupted body at the time of impact . from the initial distribution @xmath11",
    ", it should therefore be possible to estimate the three velocity components , assuming one knows the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this can be accomplished by inverting eqs .",
    "[ eq : gauss_1 ] ,  [ eq : gauss_2 ] ,  [ eq : gauss_3 ] . with the exception of extremely young asteroid families ( e.g. , the karin cluster , nesvorn et al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) , this approach is not viable in most cases . apart from the obvious limitation that we do not generally know the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , a more fundamental difficulty is that several gravitational ( e.g. , mean - motion and secular resonances , close encounters with massive asteroids ) and non - gravitational ( e.g. , yarkovsky and yorp ) effects act to change the proper elements on long timescales .",
    "the gauss equations thus can not be directly applied in most cases to obtain information about the original ejection velocities .    in this work",
    "we propose a new method to circumvent this difficulty .",
    "of the three proper elements , the proper inclination is the one that is the least affected by dynamics .",
    "for example , unlike the proper semi - major axis , the proper inclination is not directly effected by the diurnal version of the yarkovsky effect ( it is affected by the seasonal version , but this is usually a much weaker effect , whose strength is of the order of 10% of that of the diurnal version , for typical values of asteroid spin obliquities and rotation periods ( vokrouhlick and farinella 1999 ) ) . also , unlike the proper eccentricity , which is affected by chaotic diffusion in mean - motion resonances , the proper inclination is more stable .",
    "in addition , the inclination is related to a single component of the ejection velocities , @xmath0 , via eq .",
    "[ eq : gauss_3 ] .",
    "this equation can be , at least in principle , inverted to provide information about @xmath12 .",
    "what kind of a probability distribution function ( @xmath13 ) is to be expected for the original values of @xmath14 ?",
    "velocities at infinity @xmath15 are obtained from the ejection velocities @xmath16 through the relationship :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the escape velocity from the parent body . following vokrouhlick et al .",
    "( 2006a , b , c ) , we assume that the ejection velocity field follows a gaussian distribution of zero mean and standard deviation given by :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the body diameter in km , and @xmath21 is a parameter describing the width of the velocity field . only objects with @xmath22 succeed in escaping from the parent body . as a result , the initial distribution of @xmath15 should generally be more peaked than a gaussian one .",
    "[ fig : beta_fam_real ] , panel a , displays the frequency distribution function @xmath23 for 1031 objects with @xmath24 km computed for a parent body with an escape velocity of 130 m / s and @xmath25 .",
    "we assumed that @xmath26 and @xmath27 . since @xmath9 and @xmath28 appear only as multiplying factors in the expression for @xmath0 , different choices of these parameters do not affect the shape of the distribution .",
    "one can notice how the @xmath0 distribution is indeed more peaked than that of the gaussian distribution with the same standard deviation ( shown in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_fam_real ] ) .",
    "a useful parameter to understand if a given distribution is ( or is not ) normally distributed is the kurtosis ( carruba et al .",
    "pearson kurtosis ( pearson 1929 ) , defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fourth moment about the mean and @xmath31 is the standard deviation , gives a measure of the `` peakedness '' of the distribution . the gaussian distribution has @xmath32 and is the",
    "most commonly known example of a mesokurtic distribution .",
    "larger values of @xmath33 are associated with leptokurtic distributions , which have longer tails and more acute central peaks . the opposite case , with @xmath34 ,",
    "is known as platykurtic .",
    "we generated values of @xmath0 for various values of @xmath21 for ten thousand 5-km bodies originating from a parent body with @xmath35  m  s@xmath36 ( results can be re - scaled for any other body size using eq .",
    "[ eq : std_vej ] , and a different value of @xmath20 ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : beta_vej ] shows how the kurtosis value of the @xmath0 distribution changes as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "as expected , for smaller values of @xmath37 the @xmath0 distribution is more peaked , and the kurtosis values are larger . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the kurtosis value approaches 0 , because the influence of parent body s gravity diminishes .",
    "most families for which an estimate of @xmath21 is available ( see nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , sect .  5 and references within )",
    "have estimated values of @xmath37 in the range from 0.4 to 1.2 , and should therefore have been significantly leptokurtic when they formed .",
    "what typical values of @xmath33 one would expect for a real asteroid family , where different sizes of fragments are considered together ? as the large objects typically have lower values of @xmath0 , this implies that they would contribute to the peak of the distribution , and when considered with smaller fragments , the whole distribution should correspond to a larger value of @xmath33 . to illustrate this effect , we simulated a family using a size distribution @xmath39 with @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "the computed value of @xmath33 for bodies in the size range from 2 to 8 km was found to be 0.96 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : beta_fam_real ] , panels b ) , while the one for a restricted range @xmath24 km was 0.21 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : beta_fam_real ] , panel a ) .",
    "this shows that one must be careful when interpreting the real families , where the escape velocity and size distribution effects can combine together to produce larger values of @xmath33 . to isolate the escape velocity effect",

    "we have taken these results from nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , where a smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) code was used to model the formation of the karin family . in this case",
    ", the parent body was assumed to have @xmath43  km , which gives @xmath44  m s@xmath36 .",
    "different impact conditions ( impact speed , impact angle , projectile size , etc . ) were studied in this work .",
    "the dynamical evolution of fragments and their re - accretion following the initial impact was followed by the pkdgrav code .",
    "using these simulations , we extracted the values of @xmath0 for the escaping fragments and estimated the value of @xmath21 from eq .",
    "[ eq : vel_inf ] . in a specific case that produced the best fit to the observed size distribution of the karin family",
    ", we obtained @xmath45 for fragments with @xmath46  km .",
    "finally , we found that the @xmath0 distribution has @xmath47 , and is therefore significantly peaked .",
    "this is in very good agreement with results from our simple method to generate fragments ( see above ) , which for the same size range and @xmath37 gives @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests , again , that the initial @xmath0 distribution of asteroid families should be leptokurtic .",
    "now that we have some expectations for the @xmath33 values just after a family formation , we turn our attention to @xmath33 for real asteroid families , where the inferred @xmath0 values may have been affected by the long - term dynamics .",

    "the blue line shows the mean value over the 450-myr integration span , and the red lines are one standard deviation from the mean.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    bottke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) simulated the long - term dynamical evolution of the koronis family .",
    "their simulation included the gravitational effects of four outer planets and the yarkovsky effect .",
    "different sizes of simulated family members were considered .",
    "we opted to illustrate here the case with @xmath49 km , for which bottke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) numerically integrated the orbits of 210 bodies over 450 myr .",
    "the initial distribution of family members in bottke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) was obtained using the same method as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : gauss_eq ] .",
    "we computed the values of @xmath14 by inverting eq .",
    "[ eq : gauss_3 ] .",
    "since pearson s kurtosis is dependent on the presence of outliers , we eliminated from our distributions objects with values more than @xmath50 away from the mean .",
    "this allowed us to avoid possible distortions in the computed @xmath33 values caused by a few distant objects .",
    "[ fig : kurtosis_vw ] shows that the initially leptokurtic distribution tends to become more mesokurtic with time .",
    "this can be understood as follows . in statistics ,",
    "the central limit theorem states that the averages of random variables drawn from uncorrelated distributions are normally distributed .",
    "if the dynamical effects produce changes of @xmath51 compatible with the central limit theorem , one would expect that , with time , the distributions of @xmath14 should indeed become more and more mesokurtic , as the contribution from dynamics increases .    to illustrate things in the case of the ( real ) koronis family , we computed the value of @xmath33 for all its 5118 members taken from nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and for members with @xmath52  km .",
    "we obtained @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . since both these values are considerably leptokurtic , we believe that the dynamical evolution of the koronis family did not had enough time to alter the initial distribution of inclinations .",
    "therefore , in the specific case of the koronis family , we may still be observing traces of the primordial distribution of @xmath0 .",
    "we selected the families identified in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) that : ( i ) have at least 100 members with @xmath55  km , and ( ii ) have a reasonably well defined age estimate proper element domain .",
    "this method may not identify peripheral regions of some large families , the so - called _ halo _ of bro and morbidelli ( 2013 ) , as belonging to the dynamical group .",
    "for families such as the eos and koronis groups , results from nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) should be considered as conservative estimates . ] .",
    "the first selection criterion is required to have a reasonable statistics for the @xmath56 computation .",
    "if we assume that the error is proportional to the square root of the number of objects , a sample of 100 objects would give us an uncertainty in @xmath56 of 10% .",
    "we use a restricted size range , @xmath55  km , to avoid the influence of the size - dependent velocity effects on the kurtosis .",
    "the age estimate is useful to have some input for a physical interpretation of our results .",
    "also , since @xmath56 is sensitive to the presence of outliers in the distribution , we use the jarque - bera statistical test ( jbtest hereafter ) to confirm that the @xmath0 distribution differs ( or not ) from a gaussian one .",
    "we choose to work with this specific test , instead of others , because the jbtest is particularly sensitive to whether sample data have the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution ( jarque & bera 1987 ) .",
    "the test , implemented on matlab , provides a @xmath57 parameter stating the probability that a given @xmath0 distribution follows ( or not ) the gaussian @xmath13 .",
    "the null hypothesis level is usually set at 5% .",
    "finally , we also checked that the @xmath0 distribution was not too asymmetrical , and verified that its skewness , the parameter that measures a possible asymmetry , was in the range between -0.25 and 0.25 .",
    "a skewness value outside this range would indicate an asymmetric ejection velocity field , or some dynamical effects that are beyond the scope of this study .    of the 122 families listed in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , 48 cases satisfied these requirements . at this stage of our analysis",
    "we do not eliminate interlopers and do not consider in detail the local dynamics .",
    "also , families with halos may have a further spread out distribution in inclination than what accounted for by hcm , and therefore larger values of @xmath56 .",
    "for these families , our results should be considered as conservative .",
    "values of @xmath56 may be affected by these factors , but first we would like to see what families may be more interesting in terms of a simple first - order criteria .",
    "table  [ table : families_kurt ] reports the values of @xmath56 for the whole family ( 3rd column ) , for @xmath58  km ( @xmath59 ) members ( 4rd column ) , and the @xmath60 coefficient of the jbtest for the @xmath59 population .",
    "note that the maximum value of @xmath60 is 50.0% .",
    "following the notation of nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , the first two columns in table  [ table : families_kurt ] report the family identification number ( fin ) and the family name .",
    "finally , the sixth column displays the family age estimate , with its error .",
    "the age estimate was obtained using eq .  1 in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and values of the @xmath61 parameter , its error ( also estimated from eq .  1 and the value of @xmath62 from nesvorn et al .",
    "2015 ) , and geometric albedos from table 2 of that paper .",
    "densities were taken from carry ( 2012 ) for the namesake body of each family , when available . if not , a standard value of 1.2  g @xmath63 for c - complex families and 2.5  g  @xmath63 for the s - complex families was used . in a few cases , for which a better age estimate was available in the literature",
    ", we used these latter values .",
    "this includes the following cases ( labeled by @xmath64 in table 1 ) : karin ( nesvorn et al . 2002 ) , eos ( vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2006b ) , hygiea ( carruba et al .",
    "2013b ) , and koronis , themis , meliboea , and ursula ( carruba et al . 2015 ) .",
    "moreover , the families with values of skewness not in the range from -0.25 to 0.25 are identified by a `` ( s ) '' after family s name in table 1 .",
    "to select families whose @xmath0 component may have not changed significantly with time , we adopted the following criteria : @xmath56 for the @xmath59 population has to be larger than 0.25 , the estimated error on values of @xmath56 , skewness in the range from -0.25 and 0.25 , and @xmath60 has to be lower than 5% .",
    "after this pre - selection was carried out , we were left with a sample of 9 candidates this is much higher than the 2 families one would expect to randomly fulfill this criteria , based on the number of families in our sample , and this suggests that a real effect might actually be observed in our data",
    ". ordered by a decreasing value of @xmath65 , these 8 candidates are the gallia , hoffmeister , barcelona , hansa , massalia , koronis , rafita , hygiea and dora families .",
    "we discarded the case of the hoffmeister family , since this family is significantly affected by the @xmath66 resonance with ceres ( novakovi et al .",
    "2015 ) .",

    "as can be observed from this figure , these families have @xmath0 more peaked than a gaussian , and this is particularly evident for the case of the gallia family .",
    "[ fig : age_gamma ] displays values of @xmath65 versus the estimated ages of the eight families satisfying our selection criteria .",
    "one can notice that there is not a clear correlation between family age and @xmath65 .",
    "while there are 4 families younger than 700 myr , three families ( hansa , hygiea , and rafita ) are estimated to be older than 2 gyr .",
    "what these eight families have in common is that they are located in orbital regions not very affected by dynamical mechanisms capable of changing proper @xmath67 .",
    "gallia , barcelona , and hansa are families in stable islands at high inclinations , all in regions with not many mean - motion resonances ( carruba 2010 ) .",
    "as previously discussed , koronis is located in a region at low inclination relatively quiet in terms of dynamics , and the same can be said for hygiea ( carruba et al .",
    "2013b ) , and , possibly , for the rafita and massalia families ( the latter also a relatively young family , vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2006b ) .     versus the estimated age of eight families satisfying our selection criteria .",
    "the horizontal blue lines display the estimated error on the ages , while the vertical ones show the nominal errors on @xmath65 , assumed equal to 0.1.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , among the families with large values of both skewness and kurtosis , the cases of the karin and astrid families are of a particular interest to us .",
    "karin is a very young family , already identified as such in nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2006 ) , while astrid is a family located in a dynamically quiet region .",
    "nesvorn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the velocity field of karin was probably asymmetrical , so the relatively high value of the skewness that we found for the karin cluster ( -0.60 ) should not be surprising .",
    "astrid has the highest observed value of @xmath65 .",
    "this family , however , also interacts with a secular resonance that produces a large dispersion of the inclination distribution .",
    "if the resonant population of objects is removed , the value of @xmath65 drops to 0.3 , with a skewness within the acceptable range .",
    "the still large value of @xmath65 of this revised astrid group makes it a very good candidate for a family with a partially pristine @xmath0 velocity field .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the main results of this work can be summarized as follows :    * we developed a model for how the original field of velocities at infinity should appear for newly created families .",
    "families with a low @xmath68 ratio , where @xmath69 is a parameter describing the standard deviation of ejection velocity field , assumed normal ( eq .  [ eq : std_vej ] ) , and @xmath70 is the escape velocity from the parent body , should have values of velocities at infinity following a peaked distribution . this distribution is characterized by positive values of kurtosis @xmath33 ( leptokurtic distribution ) .",
    "this is confirmed by sph simulations for the karin cluster , that show a leptokurtic distribution of @xmath0 values , the component of the velocity of infinity perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "since the proper inclination is less affected by dynamical evolution than proper semi - major axis and eccentricity , and since @xmath0 can be obtained from the distribution in proper @xmath67 ( eq .  [ eq : gauss_3 ] ) , we decided to concentrate our analysis on the distribution of @xmath0 values .",
    "we studied the influence that dynamics has on the distribution of @xmath0 values .",

    "eight families , the gallia , barcelona , hansa , massalia , koronis , rafita , hygiea and dora families , satisfied these criteria and have values of @xmath65 larger than 0.25 , which suggests that they could still bear traces of the original values of @xmath0 .",

    "all of these groups appear to be located in regions not strongly affected by dynamical mechanisms able to modify proper inclination . among asymmetrical families ,",

    "overall , while a more in depth study of the families selected in this work , accounting for a better analysis of local dynamics and of the role of possible interlopers , should be performed , our analysis already allowed us to select several asteroid families that could still bear traces of the original distribution of velocities at infinity . while to select families that could still bear traces of the original values of @xmath0 we concentrated on the shape of the @xmath0 distribution , obtaining better estimates of the _ magnitude _ of @xmath0 for these selected families could much improve our knowledge of the physical mechanisms at work in the family - forming event , and serve as an useful constraints for simulations describing cratering and catastrophic destruction events , other than the observed size frequency distribution ( durda et al .",
