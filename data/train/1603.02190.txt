    "neutrino masses , the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , and the baryon asymmetry in the universe ( bau ) are the most important evidences of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . here , we propose that the same symmetry explaining neutrino mixing angles is also responsible for the dark matter stability in the context of the discrete dark matter ( ddm ) mechanism  @xcite . under certain conditions",
    "it would be possible also to account for the bau via leptogenesis .",
    "the ddm is based upon the fact that the breaking of a discrete non - abelian flavor symmetry into one of its subgroups by means of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism , accounts for the neutrino masses and mixing pattern and for the dark matter stability .    in the original model  @xcite ,",
    "the group of even permutation of four objects , @xmath0 , was considered as the flavor symmetry . as the flavor group is because it is the smallest non - abelian discrete group with triplet irreducible representation .",
    "therefore , it is possible to have in the same multiplet some inert and active particles after the flavor symmetry breaking and at the same time a reduced number of couplings for these triplets .",
    "later we will see that this reduced number of couplings is the reason why we got correlations between the observables in the neutrino sector .",
    "] @xmath0 contains one tridimensional irreducible representation , @xmath2 , and three one - dimensional irreducible representations , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , whose algebra can be reviewed in the appendix , see , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "the particle content includes four @xmath6 higgs doublets , three of them transforming as an @xmath0 triplet @xmath7 and the sm higgs @xmath8 as the singlet @xmath3 ; four right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos , three of them in a triplet representation of @xmath0 , @xmath9 ; and a singlet @xmath10 of @xmath0 , @xmath11 .",
    "the lepton doublets @xmath12 and the right charged leptons @xmath13 transform as the three different singlets under @xmath0 , in such a way that the mass matrix for the charged lepton is diagonal .",
    "breaking the @xmath0 symmetry into a @xmath1 subgroup through the electroweak symmetry breaking , provides the stability mechanism for the dm , arising from the @xmath1-odd part of the triplet @xmath14 and at the same time accounts for the neutrino masses and mixing patterns by means of the type i seesaw  @xcite .",
    "the predictions for the neutrino sector are an inverse mass hierarchy spectrum with a massless neutrino , @xmath15 , and a vanishing reactor neutrino mixing angle , @xmath16 , that nowadays is ruled out by the current experimental data  @xcite .",
    "even though , there is an issue with the reactor mixing angle , the original @xmath0 model has a quite interesting neutrino and dm phenomenology , as can be seen in  @xcite .    in a subsequent paper ,",
    "this @xmath0 model has been modified  @xcite , by adding a fifth rh neutrino @xmath17 transforming as @xmath5 and changing the representation of @xmath11 to @xmath18 .",
    "this new model gives as predictions : a normal mass spectrum , a lower bound for the neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass , @xmath19 , and a nonzero reactor neutrino mixing angle .",
    "nevertheless , even if this mixing angle were nonzero at its maximum value , it is again ruled out by the current experimental data  @xcite .",
    "there are some other works in this direction , where other flavor symmetry groups have been used , for instance , a model based on the dihedral group @xmath20 where some flavor changing neutral currents are present and constrain the dm sector  @xcite and a model based on the @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that there have been works tackling the problem of the vanishing reactor mixing angle within the @xmath0 ddm model  @xcite , but in such a case the @xmath0 symmetry has to be explicitly broken in the scalar potential . for models in which dark matter transforms nontrivially under a non - abelian flavor symmetry , see , for instance ,  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : models ] we explain our models giving their matter content and derive the neutrino mass matrices . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modres ] we discuss the phenomenology , and in sec .  [ sec : con ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we will consider two extensions of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , hereafter referred as model a and model b , where in addition to the original model matter content , we have added one extra rh neutrino @xmath17 , in a singlet representation of @xmath0 ( @xmath18 or @xmath5 ) , and three real scalar singlets of the sm transforming as a triplet under @xmath0 , @xmath22 . the relevant particle content and quantum numbers of model a and model b",
    "are summarized in tables  [ tab : moda ] and [ tab : modb ] , respectively .",
    "the @xmath17 rh neutrino is assigned to the @xmath18 representation of @xmath0 in model a and to the @xmath5 @xmath0 representation in model b. the flavon fields , @xmath23 , acquire a vacuum expectation value around the seesaw scale , such that @xmath0 is broken into a @xmath1 at this scale instead of at the electroweak scale as in the original model . in this way",

    "another consequence of the way @xmath0 is broken , in addition to dictating the neutrino phenomenology , is that these models contain a dm candidate stabilized by the remnant @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the dm phenomenology in this case will be different than the original ddm @xcite , where the limit for large dm masses ( @xmath48 gev ) was not allowed , and will be similar to the inert higgs doublet model  @xcite with extra scalar fields .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a scenario where the stability of dark matter and the phenomenology of neutrinos are related by the spontaneous breaking of a non - abelian flavor symmetry ( @xmath0 ) . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> the breaking is done at the seesaw scale , in such a way that what remains of the flavor symmetry is a @xmath1 symmetry , which stabilizes the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed two models based on this idea , for which we have calculated their neutrino mass matrices achieving two - zero texture in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we have updated this two - zero texture phenomenology finding an interesting correlation between the reactor mixing angle and the sum of the light neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> we also have a correlation between the lightest neutrino mass and the neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass , obtaining a lower bound for the effective mass within the region of the nearly future experimental sensitivities . </S>"
