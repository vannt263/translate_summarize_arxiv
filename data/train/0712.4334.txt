    "given a non periodic self - similar tiling @xmath2 generated by some similarity @xmath3 with stretching factor @xmath0 , it is rather natural to ask if we could generate @xmath2 using another similarity with a different stretching factor @xmath1 .",
    "this is of course possible taking a power of the similarity @xmath3 , where @xmath1 is in this case a power of @xmath0 .",
    "holton , radin and sadun show in @xcite that the stretching factor of any other similarity which generates @xmath2 is equal to a rational power of @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , they prove that the stretching factors of conjugate tiling systems which are the orbit closure under euclidean motions of some self similar tilings are multiplicatively dependent . in this paper",
    "we look at tiling systems which are the orbit closure under translations of some self similar tilings , in order to give a necessary condition to have non periodic common factors .",
    "the result we present in this paper is the following :    [ mainresult ] let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be two self - similar tilings satisfying the finite pattern condition , where @xmath3 and @xmath6 are primitive substitutions .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the perron eigenvalues of the substitution matrices associated to @xmath3 and @xmath6 respectively . if there exist a non periodic tiling @xmath2 and factors maps @xmath7 , for @xmath8 , then @xmath0 and @xmath1 are multiplicatively dependent .",
    "the problem we are interested in has been considered a long time ago by a. cobham in @xcite and @xcite for fixed points of substitutions of constant length .",
    "he showed that if @xmath9 are two multiplicatively independent integers then a sequence @xmath10 on a finite alphabet is both @xmath11-substitutive and @xmath12-substitutive if and only if @xmath10 is ultimately periodic , where @xmath11-substitutive means that @xmath10 is the image by a letter to letter morphism of a fixed point of a substitution of constant length @xmath11 .",
    "this theorem was the starting point of a lot of work in many different directions such as  : numeration systems for @xmath13 , substitutive sequences and subshifts , automata theory and logic ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "later , in @xcite a. semenov proved a `` multidimensional '' cobham type theorem , that is to say a cobham theorem for recognizable subsets of @xmath14 .",
    "this result can be stated in terms of self similar tilings , and in the case these tilings are repetitive , our result is a generalization of semenov theorem .    this paper is organized as follows : in section [ definitions ] we give some basic definitions relevant for the study of tiling systems and substitution tiling systems . in section [ frequencies ]",
    "we study the frequencies of the patches in self - similar tilings and in their factors .",
    "first we prove that the frequencies of the patches in a self - similar tiling @xmath2 are included in a finite union of geometric progressions of rate @xmath15 , where @xmath15 is the stretching factor of @xmath2 ( in @xcite the authors remarked this fact for minimal substitution subshifts ) .",
    "next , we prove that the frequencies of the patches in a tiling @xmath2 , which is a factor of two self - similar tiling systems with stretching factors @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , are included in the intersection of two finite unions of geometric progressions , one of rate @xmath0 and the other of rate @xmath1 .",
    "the proof of this result would be easier if the factor maps were given by a kind of `` sliding block code '' ( as it can be the case for subshifts ) , because in this case the preimage of a patch would be a finite collection of patches .",
    "nevertheless , this is no longer the case for the tiling systems we consider here ( examples of factor maps , and even conjugacies , that are not given by a `` sliding block codes '' are given in @xcite and @xcite ) , but we overcome this problem selecting carefully some patches in the preimages we considered .",
    "finally , in section 4 we deduce the main theorem .",
    "in this section we give the classical definitions concerning tilings . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "a _ tiling _ of @xmath16 is a countable collection @xmath17 of closed subsets of @xmath16 ( which are known as",
    "_ tiles _ ) whose union is the whole space and their interiors are pairwise disjoint .",
    "we assume that the tiles are homeomorphic to closed balls and that they belong , up to translations , to a finite collection of closed subsets of @xmath16 whose elements are called _ prototiles_. we say that two tiles are _ equivalent _ if they are equal up to translations .",
    "it is often useful to consider every prototile as a closed set endowed with a label . in this case ,",
    "two tiles are equivalent if , in addition , their labels coincide .",
    "the translation of the tiling @xmath2 by a vector @xmath18 is the tiling @xmath19 obtained after translating every tile of @xmath2 by @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath28 is a finite collection of tiles .",

    "we define @xmath31 as we defined @xmath32 .",
    "the tiling @xmath2 satisfies the _ finite pattern condition _ fpc ( or equivalently , we say that it is _ locally finite _ ) if for any @xmath33 , there are up to translation , only finitely many patches with diameter smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "this condition is automatically satisfied in the case of a tiling whose tiles are polyhedra that meet face - to - face .",
    "a tiling @xmath2 is _ repetitive _ if for any patch @xmath28 in @xmath2 there exists @xmath33 , such that for every open ball @xmath35 the collection @xmath36 contains a patch @xmath37 equivalent to @xmath28 ( when it is clear from the context we will say that @xmath28 `` appears '' in @xmath35 ) .",
    "the non periodic repetitive tilings that satisfy fpc are called _ perfect _ tilings .",
    "let @xmath38 be a finite collection of prototiles .",

    "it is well - known that topological factor maps between subshifts are always given by sliding - block - codes .",
