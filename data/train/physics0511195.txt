    "an electron plasma wave ( epw ) is a natural tool for manipulating the properties of intense radiation beams .",

    "also , the high - amplitude epw driven by a short laser pulse can induce the pulse shrinkage with time  @xcite .",
    "excitation of the epw by the ponderomotive force ( beatwave ) of the two - color laser with the difference frequency @xmath0 close to the electron langmiur frequency @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is an electron plasma density , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron rest mass and charge ) has attracted attention for a long time  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear plasma wave is highly sensitive to the variations of frequency and amplitude of the ponderomotive force .",
    "for example , by chirping the beat frequency  @xcite the epw excitation can be enhanced by the autoresonance effect .",
    "downshifting the beat frequency from the plasma resonance ( @xmath5 ) can also result in the large - amplitude wake excitation due to the effect of relativistic bi - stability  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the driven electron density perturbations can cause the laser amplitude modulation , either transverse  @xcite or longitudinal  @xcite . therefore , the performance of the beatwave scheme critically depends on the self - consistent evolution of the light and plasma waves that includes effects of numerous plasma nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic self - phase modulation  @xcite , stimulated forward raman scattering  @xcite ( sfrs ) , and electromagnetic cascading  @xcite ( emc ) broaden the laser frequency bandwidth , while the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) of radiation distorts the laser amplitude . in certain regimes",
    "this scenario results in a strong local enhancement of the laser field .",
    "specifically , the frequency downshifted ( @xmath5 ) beatwave pulse of initially low amplitude can be transformed into a train of sharp electromagnetic ( em ) spikes of relativistic intensity and few - laser - cycles duration  @xcite .",
    "the spikes are separated in time by the beat period @xmath6 .    in the present paper",
    "a theoretical model is formulated which , in a weakly relativistic approximation , accurately describes the nonlinear excitation and relativistic bi - stability of the epw , and frequency and amplitude modulation of the laser pulse in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) and in time .",
    "we select specific regimes in which the emc induced by near - resonantly driven epw causes laser spectral broadening . at every point of the perturbed plasma",
    ", the epw creates an index grating co - moving with the laser beams .",
    "hence , the periodic frequency modulation ( fm ) of the laser develops at a difference frequency @xmath0 . in spectral terms , the fm is manifested as a cascade of stokes and anti - stokes sidebands shifted by integer multiples of @xmath0 from the laser fundamental @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite suggested to enhance plasma heating by the decay of the cascade - driven epw .",
    "later on , the emc was considered as an epw diagnostic in the plasma beatwave accelerator  @xcite .",
    "systematic study  @xcite of plasma waveguiding options provided by the nonlinear interaction of laser beams with the cascade - driven epw revealed an enhanced self - focusing of the co - propagating beams detuned in frequency below plasma resonance ( @xmath5 ) .",

    "we prove that the gvd completely dominates the evolution of weakly - relativistic beatwave ( with intensity of initial beams over @xmath8  w/@xmath9 ) in either centimeter - scale rarefied ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ) or millimeter - scale dense plasmas ( @xmath12  @xmath11 ) .",
    "we show that the plasma wave driven _ below _ the plasma resonance , @xmath5 , chirps the laser frequency in a very special way : near the center of each laser beatnote the red - shifted sidebands are advanced in time with respect to the blue - shifted ones .",
    "the gvd can compress thus chirped beatnotes to a few - laser - cycle duration provided the laser bandwidth tends to @xmath7 .",
    "the effect of gvd is controllable : proper adjustment of the plasma and laser parameters can reduce it while preserving the desirable bandwidth . in this case",
    ", the cascade compression can be made in two stages  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : ( i ) a low - density plasma ( the modulator ) with @xmath13 is used for the fm of initially two - frequency laser , and ( ii ) a higher - density plasma ( the compressor ) with @xmath14 serves for the beatnote compression .",
    "therefore , a train of sharp electromagnetic spikes of intensity by several orders of magnitude higher than ionization threshold for any medium can be generated .",
    "similar concept of using raman cascades for radiation beams compression in molecular gases has been successfully tested in experiments  @xcite at low laser intensities ( @xmath15  w/@xmath9 ) .",
    "the technique of the emc compression in gases is not appropriate for applications requiring high laser intensity .",

    "we derive the basic theoretical model ( subsection  [ sec2.1 ] ) and analyze the basic scalings for the emc and the cascade compression ( subsection  [ sec2.2 ] ) . in a realistic plasma ,",
    "the emc is a complicated interplay between the sideband coupling through the driven electron density perturbations , gvd of radiation , nonlinearities due to the relativistic increase of an electron mass , and sfrs .",

    "[ sec3 ] account for all these effects and describe the cascade development in either two - stage ( subsection  [ sec3.1 ] ) or single - stage ( subsection  [ sec3.2 ] ) compressor . because the longest time scale of the problem is only a few ion plasma periods , parametric decay of the epw  @xcite and consequent plasma heating  @xcite are insignificant and thus ignored .",
    "the simulation parameters of subsections  [ sec3.1 ] and  [ sec3.2 ] are optimized so as to make the relativistic nonlinearities and sfrs almost negligible .",
    "when the parameters of the setup are not optimized , the sfrs can be seeded by the plasma wake driven by the beatwave pulse of finite duration . contribution from the sfrs into the cascading process is discussed in the subsection  [ sec3.3 ] . in the subsection  [ sec3.4 ]",

    "a red asymmetry of the cascade spectrum is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) .",
    "some spectral broadening versus the case of @xmath97 can be attributed to the self - phase - modulation produced by the nonlinear frequency shifts .",
    "figure  [ fig4](b ) shows that the electron density perturbation is not an integral of motion .",
    "its final amplitude is roughly twice the initial , and a small - amplitude wake is left behind the train of compressed spikes which can be recognized as a signature of sfrs . despite of this , neither the self - phase - modulation nor the sfrs are adverse for the cascade compression .    the transverse evolution of the cascade is a matter of high importance for the experimental verification of this compression scheme .",
    "for instance , electron density perturbations can significantly lower the nonlinear focusing threshold of counter - propagating laser beams  @xcite .",
    "the co - propagating cascade of electromagnetic beams also experiences enhanced focusing in both 2d ( planar ) and 3d ( cylindrical ) geometry if @xmath5 ( refs .  ) .",
    "we shall give here a few necessary estimates ( effects of transverse evolution will be given a detailed consideration in the upcoming publications ) .",
    "when the beatwave is downshifted by @xmath180{3|\\rho_{-1}|^2 /2}$ ] , the self - focusing threshold in the planar 2d geometry  @xcite is @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is a laser focal spot size ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "so , the sub - threshold regime under the parameters of figs .  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig4 ] requires the spot size @xmath184  @xmath156 m .",
    "if we loosely translate @xmath182 into the radius of the laser focal spot in the cylindrical geometry , we find that the refraction - limited interaction length @xmath185 is less than 1.2 cm .",
    "however , the required @xmath164  cm can be achieved by means of the plasma channel guiding  @xcite .     the ecm of the two - color short - pulse ( 90  fs ) laser  @xcite in a dense ( @xmath186  @xmath11 ) plasma .",
    "physical quantities are shown at the plasma entrance ( @xmath28 , gray lines ) and exit ( @xmath187  mm , black lines ) . ]    in the regime of cascade compression considered above , eliminating potentially adverse effects of laser self - phase - modulation and sfrs required complying with some hard restrictions on the laser pulse amplitude , duration , and beatwave frequency detuning ( @xmath188 , and @xmath189 ) .",
    "the next set of simulations shows that these conditions are desirable but not necessary for the manifestation of the effect .",
    "the cascade compression can be observed even for ultrashort ( @xmath190  fs ) beatwave pulses propagating in a dense plasma ( @xmath191  @xmath11 ) where neither gvd nor relativistic nonlinearities are small .",
    "we consider the evolution of a two - color ultrashort laser  @xcite whose energy is initially distributed between the fundamental ( 97% ) and the stokes ( 3% ) components .",
    "the laser frequencies are @xmath192  s@xmath193 ( @xmath155  @xmath156 m ) and @xmath194  s@xmath193 ( @xmath195  @xmath156 m ) . assuming that @xmath196",

    "the laser pulse is gaussian  ( [ 2b ] ) with a duration @xmath201  fs . in this case @xmath202 , and the beatwave pulse amplitude is not slowly varying .",
    "nevertheless , under these seemingly unfavorable conditions , the emc develops very effectively and the intensity contrast of the amplitude - modulated laser pulse grows rapidly .",
    "the plasma length is chosen so as to produce 5 sidebands on either side ; the plasma length is bounded from above by @xmath203  mm , while the compression length evaluated from formula  ( [ z_c ] ) for @xmath204 gives the lower bound , @xmath205  mm .",
    "the most spectacular features of the emc shown in fig .",
    "[ grigsby ] are observed at @xmath206  mm . at the plasma border ,",
    "@xmath28 , the intensity variation of the two - color laser is about 50% , while at @xmath206  mm very deep amplitude modulation develops with the intensity contrast ratio reaching a factor of 25 .",
    "the mostly affected are the beatnotes in the tail of the laser pulse ; they are compressed to roughly a quarter of a plasma period .",
    "the laser nonlinear evolution boosts the amplitude of the plasma wake ( which is increased by a factor of 3 ) .",
    "the laser spectrum broadens and reveals a red shift by about @xmath207 .",
    "this is a clear indication of the forward stimulated raman cascade  @xcite which , as appears in this simulation , does not prevent the beatnote compression .",
    "moreover , the laser frequency red - shifts towards the pulse tail .",
    "the red - shifted field components that form the compressed beatnotes in the tail move slower than those in the pulse head .",
    "thus , as seen in fig .",
    "[ grigsby](a ) , the beatnotes in the tail accumulate a considerable time delay ( about a quarter of the beat period ) with respect to the initial positions of their maxima .",
    "this time delay is in agreement with the frequency shift @xmath207 .",
    "the simulations presented in this subsection demonstrate the robustness of the emc in the conditions when the gvd is large , and the nonlinear processes of the relativistic self - phase modulation and the sfrs interfere the cascading process .",
    "slow variation of the beatwave pulse envelope is therefore helpful but not necessary for the cascade compression .",
    "equations  ( [ 2 ] ) admit the longitudinal transfer of electromagnetic energy in the co - moving frame .",
    "therefore , the laser amplitude modulation may result not only from the emc with concurrent compression of beatnotes but also as a consequence of the sfrs instability  @xcite ( also referred to as the 1d resonant modulational instability  @xcite ) .",
    "the sfrs is different from the emc .",
    "the latter is merely a phase modulation which may proceed in the absence of gvd .",
    "the sfrs is a resonant process seeded by the electron density perturbations oscillating at the plasma frequency @xmath89 .",
    "the instability bandwidth is much narrower than @xmath89 even in the case of relativistically strong pump , @xmath208 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . and , in the examples of figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig4 ] , the sfrs bandwidth is much lower than the absolute value of the beatwave frequency detuning @xmath117 .",
    "however , an electron plasma response to the laser beatwave _ always _ contains a component oscillating at @xmath89 .",
    "this component is due to the finite duration of the beatwave pulse , and its amplitude is governed by the product @xmath209 .",
    "these resonant density perturbations can be enhanced by the sfrs to a level comparable to that of a non - resonant plasma response , and can interfere the phase modulation process .",
    "hence , the effect of the sfrs is adverse and should be avoided by the judicious choice of laser and plasma parameters .",
    "the seed level for the sfrs can be reduced by taking @xmath189 .",
    "for example , parameters used in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig4 ] correspond to @xmath210 and reveal no sfrs manifestation : no considerable plasma wake is left behind the laser at @xmath149 .",

    "[ fig2 ] , reduction in the beatwave pulse duration by a factor of 2.5 ( @xmath212 ) produces visible enhancement of the plasma wake that can be attributed to the sfrs manifestation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] ) . at the plasma border ,",
    "the wake amplitude is @xmath213 .",
    "taking @xmath214 as the sfrs seed amplitude , we can theoretically evaluate the amplification factor by using the formula  ( 4.12 ) of ref .",
