    "black holes and singularities are certainly some of the most peculiar and interesting features of general relativity@xcite . from the perspective of fundamental theory their properties are far from completely understood , especially their relation to quantum theory@xcite ; from the perspective of astrophysics and observational astronomy they seem more and more to play a central role in the physics of objects ranging from stellar to cosmological size@xcite .",
    "most general relativity textbooks devote considerable space to discussing the simplest example of a black hole containing a singularity , the schwarzschild geometry@xcite , and some also discuss kerr s generalization to a rotating system , although only a few derive it@xcite .",
    "most also explain , at least qualitatively , why black holes should exist in the real world , based on the instability of neutron stars of more than about 4 solar masses ; even neutron degeneracy pressure is not sufficient to provide stability .",
    "a few texts also discuss schwarzschild s interior solution for a constant density star@xcite , which clearly illustrates some of the same instability features as more realistic neutron star models .",
    "but the actual dynamical process of collapse , whereby a massive body becomes a black hole , is a more complex dynamical problem , and is often either neglected or treated heuristically and qualitatively .    for a brief history of gravitational collapse see reference@xcite .",
    "the study of gravitational collapse dynamics began with the classic seminal work of oppenheimer and snyder@xcite , who set up the equations and gave a semi - quantitative discussion of the collapse of a spherical non - radiating star .",
    "they also found a complete analytic solution for the case of a uniform perfect fluid of zero pressure - now widely referred to as `` dust . ''",
    "this example is less artificial than it might appear since the effect of pressure in a more realistic treatment turns out to be not very critical ; but the treatment by oppenheimer and snyder involves some awkward algebra in its treatment of the boundary between the interior and exterior of the dust star .    some textbooks discuss collapse much like oppenheimer and snyder , notably landau and lifshitz@xcite and misner thorne and wheeler@xcite . in particular these texts use a novikov type coordinate system , in which the dust is co - moving in a bound orbit@xcite .",
    "this coordinate system is synchronous and co - moving , and is wonderfully simple conceptually , but almost equally awful algebraically . due to the algebraic difficulty , we believe , this is not the simplest way to treat the problem .",
    "most other texts give a heuristic but convincing analysis by comparing the motion of a dust particle just outside a collapsing dust sphere with the motion of the surface ; matching this motion is equivalent to matching the exterior and interior geometries , which is a rather obvious but important theorem@xcite .",
    "what we have tried to do in the present paper is to analyze dynamical collapse in as simple a way as possible by our choice of coordinates ; we use eddington - finkelstein@xcite type coordinates for infalling incoherent light or `` null dust , '' and painleve - gullstrand@xcite type coordinates for perfect fluids , including dust .",
    "these coordinates seem almost magically well suited to this purpose , as we hope will become apparent in sections 2 and 5 .",
    "we use zero energy fluid systems in contrast to negative energy bound systems as used in references [ 3 ] and [ 5 ] , largely because the algebra is much simpler@xcite .",
    "this choice seems to us well justified because the zero and nonzero energy systems have the same qualitative behavior as they approach the black hole state as seen from outside in terms of standard schwarzschild time , and have exactly the same behavior as they approach the singularity as seen in terms of the proper time of a falling observer .",
    "moreover the zero energy case does not have the awkward conceptual problem of the motion before the maximum size is reached , since the maximum size occurs at an infinite time in the past .",
    "we therefore believe the zero energy case is more illustrative and economical of effort .    almost needless to say we have treated only spherically symmetric collapsing systems .",
    "the birkhoff theorem guarantees that a spherically symmetric system does not emit gravitational radiation ; non - spherically symmetric collapse generally entails gravitational radiation , making the problem vastly more complex , though also more interesting .    to achieve our goal of simple textbook type examples of collapse , we must pay a price , which is some degree of artificiality .",
    "the main artificiality is the spherical symmetry ; also the in - falling shells of light or other massless material of sections 2 and 3 are not likely to be found in nature ; similarly we do not expect to find the perfect fluid sphere surrounded by an elastic shell of section 5 , or the zero pressure perfect fluid of sections 6 and 7 .    since our purpose in the present paper is overtly pedagogical , much of what we obtain here",
    "is known and available somewhere in the vast research literature , although obtained with different techniques and different coordinates .",
    "however we believe our treatment is the simplest , both conceptually and algebraically , mainly due to our coordinate choice .",
    "we do not know of any use of painleve - gullstrand coordinates in the present context , although they are becoming more widely used@xcite ; as will be seen in section 6 these coordinates combine a schwarzschild type radial coordinate and a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) type cosmological time coordinate to give a natural interpolating system for describing both the interior and exterior of a fluid sphere .",
    "while the eddington - finkelstein and painleve - gullstrand coordinates serve their mathematical purpose quite well , they have a number of drawbacks such as a  time `` marker that is not well - behaved everywhere in spacetime , and they are not synchronous ; we have therefore also treated the collapse of a thin shell of light by transforming to kruskal - szekeres coordinates , which are conformally flat and thus display the causal structure of the collapse process quite clearly@xcite . in kruskal - szekeres",
    "coordinates one has a nice picture for distinguishing real world black holes from ' ' eternal \" black holes , with their associated wormholes and white hole segments , none of which may be expected to actually exist in our universe .",
    "we use throughout this paper a rather novel technique for handling the boundary conditions between the fluid and the exterior , which we believe is physically clear .",
    "since the pioneering work of oppenheimer and snyder there has been an enormous amount of work on gravitational collapse and related topics , most directed to research rather than pedagogy .",
    "the present pedagogical paper originated from several research problems , one involving a formation mechanism for singularity - free black holes filled with heavy vacuum , and another involving a finite version of the standard or  concordance \" cosmological model .",
    "for these we needed analytic collapse models that were algebraically simpler and more explicit than we found in the literature .",
    "our hope is that our methods and models might also be of use to students and teachers in illustrating more standard gravitational collapse .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the first part ( sections 2 to 4 ) deals with collapsing shells of incoherent light or null dust , which is entirely characterized by its null 4-velocity and energy density ; the second part ( sections 6 and 7 ) deals with spheres of perfect fluid , including some with nonzero pressure and some with non - uniform density . in section 2",
    "we use eddington - finkelstein coordinates to obtain the metric for the collapse of a thin light shell onto a black hole to form a larger black hole , and the collapse of a thin light shell to form a black hole ab initio .",
    "the ab initio collapse is amusing in that it is almost certainly the simplest complete scenario for the formation of a black hole , albeit it a rather artificial one . in section 3",
    "we use the results of section 2 to obtain the metric for the collapse of a thick shell of light , layer by layer .",
    "the density profile of the shell is largely arbitrary , and we give one specific example . in section 4",
    "we transform the metric for the thin light shell collapse to conformably flat kruskal - szekeres coordinates in order to display the causal structure of the geometry in a clear way - nearly equivalent to a penrose diagram ; as already noted we use these coordinates to emphasize the difference between black holes formed by collapse and eternal schwarzschild black holes . in section 5",
    "we present our way of doing the classic problem of collapse of a uniform fluid sphere , using painleve - gullstrand coordinates for maximum simplicity .",
    "we also obtain an explicit solution for a nonzero pressure fluid with a linear equation of state : @xmath0 ; to balance the pressure gradient force at the surface we use the artifice of a thin elastic shell with tangential pressure instead of the slowly decreasing radial pressure of a real stellar system ; our model is essentially a balloon with uniform internal density and pressure .",
    "the stress energy tensor of the surface is described by the radius of the sphere , its energy density , and the parameter @xmath1 ; for @xmath2 we recover the standard results for the dust ball . in section 6",
    "we deal with zero pressure non - uniform dust spheres , with the density characterized by a largely arbitrary function ; again using painleve - gullstrand coordinates we build up the system layer by layer , to obtain the standard results of oppenheimer and snyder and landau and lifshitz etc . we do not allow the dust layers to cross , which could give rise to infinite densities and superficial singularities@xcite .",
    "we give one specific example of the metric of a non - uniform sphere ; the special case of uniform density agrees with the analysis of section 5 .",
    "since this paper is mainly pedagogical we have throughout sacrificed brevity and included considerable algebraic detail ; only elementary mathematical methods are used .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some simple and fairly obvious extensions of the present work can be made .",
    "first , by a reversal of time the collapse of light shells can be viewed as outgoing radiation , so we may easily obtain results like those of vaidya for the geometry of a radiating body@xcite .",
    "similarly the collapse of the perfect fluid can be time reversed to yield the metric for a black hole emitting matter , that is a type of white hole .",
    "also it is straightforward to include a cosmological constant term in the equations to obtain the metric for a collapsing system in an exterior schwarzschild de sitter geometry ; due to its somewhat more cumbersome algebra we have not included this in the present paper , and leave it as an exercise .",
    "( see reference@xcite . )",
    "we will say more about further extensions and applications in section 8 .",
    "the motion of light in schwarzschild geometry is algebraically awkward at and inside the schwarzschild radius when schwarzschild coordinates are used , but it becomes quite simple in eddington - finkelstein ( ef ) coordinates . in this section we use ef coordinates to study the motion of light , the growth of a black hole by absorption of light , and the ab initio formation of a black hole by a thin shell of light .",
    "the last process is most likely the simplest model for the formation of a black hole by gravitational collapse .",
    "the schwarzschild metric in schwarzschild coordinates is , with @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the black hole surface is a sphere at the schwarzschild radius ( twice the geometric mass ) @xmath7 .",
    "it is both an infinite redshift surface where @xmath8 and a null surface or one - way - membrane . in terms of the schwarzschild time",
    "coordinate both light and particles take an infinite time to reach the black hole surface from the exterior . specifically , for light falling radially from @xmath9 @xmath10 thus light never reaches the surface but approaches asymptotically with a characteristic time @xmath11 .",
    "it is for this reason that we introduce the ef time coordinate , in terms of which the surface is reached in a finite time .",
    "the ef time coordinate is obtained from the schwarzschild time by a radially dependent shift @xmath12 this leads to the ef form of metric , @xmath13 provided that we choose the transformation function @xmath14 to obey @xmath15 the solution to this is @xmath16 which has an infinite stretch at @xmath17 .",
    "henceforth we refer to the coordinates and metric form in eq.([ef ] ) as ef for any function @xmath18 .",
    "the ef form is extremely convenient because radially infalling light behaves quite simply if the plus sign in eq.([ef ] ) is chosen .",
    "for such light we set the line element equal to zero , to obtain @xmath19 so that @xmath20 thus the path of infalling light is independent of the metric function @xmath21 , and is the same as in flat space .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ thinlightshellef ] .",
    "conversely , outgoing light `` stalls '' where @xmath22 and @xmath8 , that is at the infinite redshift surface",
    ".        we will soon need the einstein tensor for the ef metric form eq.([ef ] ) .",
    "its nonzero components are easily calculated to be @xmath23 here a dot denotes a time derivative and a prime denotes a radial derivative .",
    "we define the stress energy tensor in terms of the einstein tensor by using the field equations @xmath24 for pure schwarzschild geometry the einstein tensor is everywhere zero , as is easily verified .",
    "we now study the formation of a black hole by a single thin shell of light , and in the next section we will consider a thick shell of light . for both purposes we begin with a thin shell of light falling into a schwarzschild black hole with radius @xmath11 to form a black hole with radius @xmath25 as shown in fig .",
    "[ thinlightshellef]a ; the light shell obeys @xmath26 everywhere .",
    "we may write the metric in all of spacetime using a step function @xmath27 and its complement @xmath28 , as @xmath29 which is of course time dependent . substituting this into eq.([pgg ] ) and eq.([einsteinequation ] )",
    "we obtain the stress - energy tensor for the thin light shell , which is singular due to the step function , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the null vector @xmath33 corresponds to infalling light . from the energy density",
    "@xmath34 we may calculate the energy or effective mass of the light shell by going to a time in the distant past when the shell was in asymptotically flat space , @xmath35 this verifies that the mass of the initial black hole plus the energy or effective mass of the light shell equals the mass of the final black hole .",
    "the above results hold for the special case when the initial black hole is replaced by flat space , or @xmath36 .",
    "note that everything above is consistent with the interior of a spherical thin light shell being flat minkowski space .",
    "this represents the formation of a black hole by the gravitational collapse of a single thin light shell ( or other massless material ) , as shown in figure 1b ; this would seem to be the simplest complete example of gravitational collapse .",
    "our results from the preceding section may be used to construct a model for the collapse of a thick light shell , layer by layer .",
    "the initial state is a sequence of concentric thin shells with a flat minkowski interior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ thicklightshellef]a .",
    "each region of spacetime has a schwarzschild geometry as discussed in the previous section .",

[ thicklightshellef]b .        a labeling scheme , which is convenient for both the present light shell and the fluid systems to be discussed later , is to take the energy inside the @xmath43 shell to be proportional to @xmath43 , @xmath47 the time at which the @xmath43 shell reaches the center may be chosen almost arbitrarily as a function of @xmath43 , subject to the constraints that it be 0 for the innermost shell @xmath48 and increase monotonically to the final time @xmath49 for the outermost shell @xmath50 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ thicklightshellef ] .",
    "we denote this function as @xmath51 , for reasons that will become apparent .",

    "thus @xmath57 serves as a density profile function , and the metric in the interior of the light shell may be written as @xmath58 the infinite redshift surface , defined by @xmath22 , is thus determined by @xmath59 inverting this we obtain for the infinite redshift surface @xmath60 this implies that if the total duration of collapse @xmath49 is sufficiently large then @xmath61 must be a positive monotonic function of @xmath62 .    using the metric function eq.([continuousu ] )",
    "we may calculate the einstein tensor and the stress - energy tensor from eq.([efg ] ) and eq.([einsteinequation ] ) .",
    "this gives for the light shell , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the derivative of @xmath57 with respect to its argument , and @xmath33 is the null vector defined in eq.([thinlightshelleft ] ) . from this",
    "we obtain the energy density and the total energy of the light shell as @xmath65 where the integral is again done in the asymptotically flat spacetime of the distant past , verifying that the energy of the light shell is equal to the final black hole mass .    our approach to boundaries and boundary conditions",
    "is somewhat unorthodox ; we do not impose boundary conditions per se on the metric function between regions of spacetime .",
    "instead we use the above solutions ( in vacuum and within the light shell ) to calculate the stress - energy tensor , which is defined by the field equations and eq.([efg ] ) .",
    "the resulting stress energy tensor must be zero in vacuum , correctly represent the stress energy within the light shell , and describe the stress on the boundaries .",
    "if it does , the solution makes physical sense . for the region near the inner and outer boundaries of the light shell we may write the metric function as @xmath66 calculating the stress energy tensor from eq.([efg ] ) and eq.([einsteinequation ] ) we find that there is no singular shell at these boundaries since the relevant singular derivatives cancel ; thus the stress - energy tensor associated with the boundaries is zero and the solution is thus physically reasonable .    as a specific example",
    "let us take the density profile function to be linear , @xmath67 this corresponds to a constant rate of energy impacting the center . from eq.([continuousu ] ) the metric function in the various regions is , @xmath68 the infinite redshift surface , from eq.([thicklightshellinfiniteredshiftsurface ] ) , is the linear function @xmath69 the slope of this is positive for @xmath70 , that is when the light shell thickness is greater than its schwarzschild radius . within the light shell the energy density is , from eq.([efg ] ) and eq.([einsteinequation ] ) , @xmath71 which is independent of time .    in fig .",
    "[ thicklightshellefhorizon ] we show a qualitative sketch of some outgoing light rays for a fairly general light shell .",
    "the sketch is made by noting that , from eq.([eflight ] ) : the slope of outgoing rays is 1 in the minkowski region and at large distances it approaches 1 ; the slope is 0 along the infinite redshift surface ; finally , the slope is -1 at the center of the black hole .",
    "there is a last - ray - out emitted from the origin to infinity , after which all outgoing rays ( as well as particles ) are trapped within the surface at @xmath11 and eventually fall into the singularity .",
    "the surface defined by the last - ray - out is thus a global horizon .",
    "this illustrates that the horizon and the infinite redshift surface are quite different inside the time dependent light shell , unlike the situation for the time independent schwarzschild geometry .        as a further application of our methods we note that our results can be reversed in time to describe radiation being emitted by a spherically symmetric system such as a star or black hole @xcite .",
    "to do this we use the minus sign for the metric in eq.(4 ) and turn the diagram in fig.2b upside down .",
    "it is then easy to modify our algebraic results to describe any reasonable light shell density profile .",
    "this may be useful in studying the final stages of black hole evaporation , when the gravitational field of the radiation becomes comparable to that of the black hole and can not be neglected @xcite ; it might help in determining if a black hole radiates entirely away to vacuum or leaves behind a remnant @xcite .",
    "the thin light shell discussed in section 2 is probably the simplest model of gravitational collapse . however in ef coordinates @xmath72 is negative for the interior of the black hole .",
    "this means that if one is at coordinate rest @xmath73 then the square of the proper time interval @xmath74 has the opposite sign of the square of the coordinate time interval @xmath75 , so that @xmath61 may not be interpreted as a good time marker in that region of spacetime .",
    "the same is true of schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "kruskal - szekeres ( ks ) coordinates , which are discussed in many texts , were developed to solve this problem@xcite . here",
    "we will obtain ks type coordinates for the thin light shell collapse of section 2 .    by ks coordinates",
    "we mean a system in which the @xmath76 part of the metric is conformal to flat minkowski space , with no singularities or zeroes .",
    "we first show how a metric in ef form , with @xmath77 , may be put into conformal form . the metric eq.([ef ] )",
    "may be factored as follows , with angular dependence suppressed , @xmath78 the quantities @xmath79 and @xmath80 are termed conformal null coordinates since the line element is zero along lines of constant @xmath79 or @xmath80 ; these thus represent radially moving light rays .",

    "] ) now becomes quite simple @xmath161 in the schwarzschild region this is the same as the classical newtonian equation for a radially falling test particle of zero energy .",
    "we will soon need the einstein tensor and the stress - energy tensor . from the pg metric form it is straightforward and only slightly tedious to calculate these .",
    "the nonzero components of the einstein tensor are @xmath162 as before we define the stress - energy tensor via the field equations @xmath163 ; in particular the energy density is @xmath164 thus the density is uniform , as expected .",
    "we now join the spacetime regions inside and outside the fluid by demanding that the metric function @xmath157 in eq.([uniformfluidpsi ] ) be continuous across the fluid surface boundary .",
    "this gives @xmath165 the geodesic equation for a zero energy falling particle in the schwarzschild exterior region is @xmath166 this agrees with the motion of the surface eq.([uniformfluidboundary ] ) only for the case of @xmath142 , that is dust .",
    "thus a freely falling particle may hover at the falling surface of a dust ball , as it should .",
    "however , if the pressure is nonzero and @xmath167 then the surface will fall more rapidly .",
    "this is due the stress in the surface layer , as we will see .",

    "the surface tension of a fluid sphere is related to its radius and pressure by @xmath170 ; in the present case this implies from eq.([frwsolution ] ) and eq.([uniformfluidt00 ] ) , @xmath171 which agrees with eq.([uniformfluidt22 ] ) .",
    "thus the stress - energy tensor indeed represents a surface tension that balances the internal pressure of the fluid to keep it stable .",
    "this is why the surface falls faster than a freely falling particle .    in summary the collapse of a uniform fluid sphere",
    "is described by the metric function in eq.([pg ] ) and eq.([uniformfluidpsi ] ) , the density in eq.([uniformfluidt00 ] ) , and the surface tension in eq.([uniformfluidt22 ] ) .",

    "the layers are prohibited from crossing to prevent superficial singularities due to the consequent infinite density@xcite .",
    "pg coordinates will again be used , with the metric form eq.([pg ] ) containing a single metric function @xmath172 .",
    "the einstein tensor for this is given in eq.([pgg ] ) , and we recall that in pg coordinates we may take proper time and coordinate time intervals to be equal along zero energy particle geodesics .        in analogy with section 3",

    "[ dustshellpg ] .",
    "the shell is assumed to be very light , so that @xmath173 and @xmath174 differ by a small @xmath175 , and the schwarzschild radii differ by @xmath176 . as in section 5 the metric function in the two schwarzschild regions",
    "is @xmath177 the equation of the thin dust shell is that of a geodesic for a zero energy particle in the schwarzschild geometry , given in eq.([pggeodesicsolution ] ) .",
    "it is important that coordinate and proper time intervals are equal along the geodesic , so that the equation for the boundary is a relation between the coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath61 .    to obtain the stress - energy tensor for the dust shell we write the metric in the vicinity of the boundary as @xmath178 where @xmath179 as before",
    "from the einstein tensor in eq(refpgg this leads , as in section 3 , to a singular energy density for the dust shell , @xmath180 from this we may calculate the mass of the shell by going to large negative times when the shell is in nearly flat space .",
    "@xmath181 we thus verify that the mass of the initial black hole plus the shell mass is equal to the mass of the final black hole .",

    "the time at which the @xmath43 shell impacts the center may be chosen rather arbitrarily , and we denote it by @xmath193 . for simplicity and to avoid density singularities",
    "it is important that the shells do not cross each other .",

    "thus we choose @xmath193 to increase monotonically from 0 to @xmath49 as @xmath43 runs from 0 to 1 .",
    "the equation for the @xmath43 shell is then the free fall equation for a particle of zero energy , with the particle reaching the origin at @xmath193 , or @xmath194 = 0 .",

    "if the function @xmath193 is specified we can use eq.([dustinfiniteredshiftsurface ] ) and eq.([mlambda ] ) and eq.([dustgeodesicequation ] ) to get a parametric expression for the infinite redshift surface ; the radius and time are given in terms of @xmath43 by @xmath195 in particular for the central shell with @xmath48 , which impacts the center at @xmath145 , and the outer shell with @xmath50 , which impacts at @xmath184 , we have for the infinite redshift surface @xmath196 thus the surface will move outward with time if @xmath197  that is if the mass impacts the origin sufficiently slowly .",
    "curiously the same expression occurred for the light shell collapse in eq.([thicklightshellinfiniteredshiftsurfaceexample ] ) .",
    "for the special case of zero total impact time , @xmath198 , all of the shells impact the center at @xmath145 .",
    "this is corresponds to the uniform density fluid sphere in the previous section , so @xmath199 clearly implies uniform density .",
    "we can explicitly see the relation between @xmath193 and the density by solving the shell equation eq.([dustgeodesicequation ] ) for the mass @xmath45 inside the shell @xmath43 at a large negative time @xmath200 , when @xmath201 , to get @xmath202 r^3 \\approx \\frac{2}{9t^2 } r^3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus in the distant past the mass is proportional to @xmath203 , meaning that the dust is asymptotically uniform .",
    "as time progresses to smaller negative values the density may deviate more and more from uniform , and may be quite non - uniform at @xmath145 .    to obtain the metric and other properties of a collapsing dust ball",
    "we first specify a function @xmath204 .",
    "then the shell equation eq.([dustgeodesicequation ] ) gives the shell parameter as a function of position , that is @xmath205 .",
    "this is consistent because we allow only one shell to pass through a given point . with the parameter known as a function of position the metric in the fluid",
    "is given by eq.([dustspherepsi ] ) .",
    "with this expression for the shell parameter the shell relation eq.([dustgeodesicequation ] ) is an identity in @xmath206 .",
    "a number of interesting properties of the dust region may be expressed in terms of the function @xmath193 .",
    "( later we will consider a specific @xmath193 to illustrate further . ) from the expression eq.([dustspherepsi ] ) for the metric function @xmath157 and @xmath207 we may calculate the einstein tensor from eq.([pgg ] ) , obtaining @xmath208 for the other components we need to relate the derivatives @xmath209 and @xmath210 to each other , which may be done using the shell relation eq.([dustgeodesicequation ] ) .",
    "differentiating eq.([dustgeodesicequation ] ) we find @xmath211 thus the ratio of derivatives is independent of the function @xmath204 . with the use of eq.([lambdadotprime ] ) it is only slightly tedious to show that , for any @xmath204 , @xmath212 thus the pressure terms of the stress - energy tensor are zero , as we expect for dust .",
    "moreover the energy density of the dust is @xmath213 from this we may verify that the total mass of the dust ball is the mass of the final black hole , which we do by again going to large negative times when the dust is in nearly flat space , @xmath214 finally the stress energy tensor on the dust ball surface is zero according to eq.([surfacetension ] ) with @xmath142 .",
    "there are two specific examples of the function @xmath193 for which eq.([pgg ] ) is easily solved .",

    "this is singular and thus quite different from the first example , and is not represented by fig.8b : it is singular for @xmath221 , meaning that the central dust layer collapsed to the center in the infinite past and the outer layer reached the center at time @xmath222 .",
    "we again leave it as an exercise to show that the metric function is @xmath223 and that the density is @xmath224 the singularity at @xmath107 is mild in the sense that the mass inside a sphere goes like @xmath225 . as @xmath226 the density approaches infinity as expected .",
    "thus this example represents a dust ball with a mildly singular central density in the distant past , which grows stronger with time until complete collapse , and represents a rather realistic and amusing system @xcite .",
    "finally , we briefly note some properties of light rays in the collapsing dust ball . from the pg metric eq.([pg ] ) we may write the coordinate velocity of light as @xmath227 we generally expect that @xmath157 will be zero at @xmath107 , except near @xmath145 , so @xmath228 there ; note that this is not true for the second example considered above . also , @xmath228 for asymptotically large distances . on the infinite redshift surface",
