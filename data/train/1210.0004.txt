    "the standard model of cosmology emerging from recent observations is a remarkable success of theoretical physics .",
    "it can explain the cosmological observations up to an extremely high precision using a handful set of parameters . however , there are some effects that seem to be anomalous in the standard cosmological model . one of such observational fact is the power anomaly at the low multipoles of the cmb power spectrum .",
    "it has been seen that the power at the low multipoles are lower then their theoretical predictions and there are possibly correlation between the orientations of the low multipoles .",
    "many researchers have tried to explain the phenomenon such as in @xcite , but the phenomenon is not satisfactorily explained . in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the effect of the non - circular beam as origin of cmb anomalies at low multipoles .    in most of the cmb experiments such as wmap ,",
    "the beam shape of the detectors are non - circular about the pointing direction .",
    "however in the data analysis techniques the beam is assumed to be circularly symmetric .",
    "the cmb dipole is almost @xmath0 times stronger than the quadrupole . therefore due to the non - circularity of the beam",
    "some power from dipole may leak to the quadrupole and immediate higher multipoles .",
    "however , assuming a circular beam in the data analysis technique , this leakage of the power from dipole will not be accounted for .",
    "therefore , the contribution of this effect will contaminate the resultant map , generated by this inadequate data analysis technique .",
    "different effects of non - circular beam have been discussed by different authors in @xcite . however",
    ", this particular effect of leakage from the dominant dipole has not been analyzed yet .    in this paper",
    ", analytical methods have been developed to calculate the amount of power leakage from dipole and simulations with the actual scan pattern of wmap have been carried out showing the order of power leakage for different wmap beams .",
    "our results show that the amount may not be sufficient to explain the anomalies , but the power transfer does have a measurable effect on the quadrupole . in anticipation , a similar simulation has also been carried out with planck scan pattern . as the data for planck beams are not available publicly we provide only upper limits to the beam non - circularity parameters beyond which the dipole leakage would cause detectable effect in the power spectrum .",
    "this section describes the formalism employed for measuring the power leakage from dipole to the quadrupole and higher multipoles during scanning the sky with a non - circular beam .",
    "the measured sky temperature in a cmb experiment is a convolution of the true sky temperature with the beam function .",
    "if the measured temperature along @xmath1 is expressed by @xmath2 , where as the sky temperature along @xmath3 is @xmath4 then    @xmath5    here @xmath6 is the noise in the scan procedure .",
    "since we deal with low multipoles , the noise is ignored in our analysis . here",
    "the beam function @xmath7 represents the sensitivity of the telescope around the pointing direction @xmath1 .",
    "this is a two point function and can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics as    @xmath8    since we intend to measure the power leakage from dipole to the quadrupole and it is convenient to consider only the sky dipole map and check the amount of power leakage from the dipole to higher multipole due to the non - circular beam .",
    "a dipole map @xmath4 can be written as a sum of all the spherical harmonics with @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 . however , its always possible to choose a coordinate system such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 modes vanish and the sky temperature can be expressed only as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant . in such a case",
    "the measured sky temperature along the @xmath1 direction can be expressed as    @xmath15t(\\gamma)d\\omega_{\\gamma}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & t_{0}\\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m =- l}^{l}b_{lm}(\\gamma_{i})\\int y_{l}^{m}(\\gamma)y_{1}^{0}(\\gamma)d\\omega_{\\gamma } =   t_{0}b_{10}(\\gamma_{i})\\label{eq : scanned temperature}\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above expression can not be directly used for measuring the sky temperature because it contains the beam harmonic coefficient @xmath16 , which is a function of @xmath1 .",
    "it is convenient to orient the beam along some fixed direction of the sky , say along the @xmath17 direction , and consider the multipole @xmath18 to characterise the beam @xcite .",
    "the spherical harmonic coefficients of the beam @xmath19 at any particular direction @xmath1 can obtained by using wigner - d functions as @xmath20    substituting explicit expressions in terms of trigonometric functions for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , in the above and using eq([eq : scanned temperature ] ) , the expression for the scanned temperature can be written as    @xmath24\\label{eq : temp}\\ ; .\\ ] ]    here @xmath25 is the orientation of the semi - major axis of the beam at the @xmath26 scan point .",
    "the function @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be defined as follows . in eq([eq : beam rotation ] ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 are complex quantities . since the beam is real , the beam spherical harmonic coefficients should satisfy the relation @xmath31 . here , @xmath32 and @xmath33 has been defined as @xmath34 , i.e. the real and the imaginary part of @xmath29 .    from eq([eq : temp ] ) we can calculate the power that gets leaked to the quadrupole or the higher multipoles .",
    "it can be seen from eq([eq : temp ] ) that the term with @xmath35 will not contribute to any power leakage from dipole .",
    "therefore the dipole to quadrupole power transfer is caused only by the terms multiplied with @xmath28 or @xmath27 .",
    "hence , if the experimental beam is designed in such a way that the @xmath28 or @xmath27 components of the beam are completely negligible than it is possible to completely eliminate the dipole to higher multipole power transfers .",
    "the wmap satellite follows a unique scan pattern , in which pixels near the two poles are scanned for large number of times , whereas those which are near the equator are scanned for least number of times .",
    "the satellite scans the sky temperature in five different frequency bands , named as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 in a differential measurements of a pair of horns . amongst them @xmath38 and @xmath39 band have two detectors each and @xmath40 band has four detectors .",
    "each of these detectors has a pair of horns , both of which are are about @xmath41 off the symmetry axis .",
    "it has a fast spin about the symmetry axis with the spin period of around @xmath42 minutes .",
    "along with this fast spin , the spacecraft has a slow precession , @xmath43 about the sun - wmap line .",
    "this precession period is about @xmath44 hour .",
    "the earth - sun vector rotates @xmath45 in a year .",
    "the simulation has been carried with a dipole map , similar to the known cmb dipole .",
    "we assumed that the shape of the two beams for a pair of horns of a detector are almost same , i.e. the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath46 are same for both the beams of a detector .",
    "all the simulations have been carried out on healpix map with @xmath47 resolution .",
    "the simulation gives us three independent maps from the three independent components of eq([eq : temp ] ) .",
    "the figures from the three maps are shown in the fig.[fig : wmap - simulation ] .",
    "all these maps are shown in ecliptic coordinate system .",
    "these maps can be multiplied with @xmath46 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and then summed up to get the final scanned map from a detector and hence the amount of power transfer can be calculated .",
    "the values of the beam spherical harmonic coefficients i.e. @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath46 along with the amount of power leakage are listed in the table [ tab : the - coefficients ] .",
    "the analysis shows that the temperature leaked into the quadrupole from the dipole is less than @xmath48 compared to the cmb quadrupole measured by wmap of @xmath49 . although the dipole power leakage is small , the amount of power leakage is sufficient to suggest a deeper analysis of the wmap data for this effect .",

    "the planck satellite has only one beam for each detector and thus instead of the differential measurement it measures the actual temperature of the sky .",

    "the precession rate is taken as one revolution per six month and the spin rate as @xmath86 .",
