    "nanotechnology has garnered much interest in the last few decades because of the wide range of applications that come out of it .",
    "nanoclusters , small clusters comprising tens to millions of atoms , are used in a variety of settings , such as tuning the optical  @xcite and electronic properties of materials  @xcite , biolabeling and imaging  @xcite , catalysis  @xcite , and chemical sensing  @xcite . the various structures to which nanoclusters solidify , as well as their surface properties , bear a strong impact on their function  @xcite .",
    "much attention has been paid to the size dependence of nanocluster structure .",
    "experimental work on argon clusters showed that for fewer than 50 atoms , polyicosahedral structure emerges  @xcite , for larger particles up to 750 atoms multilayer icosahedra are formed , while beyond this size the structure becomes fcc  @xcite .",
    "simulations with the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , a reasonable model for noble gases , as well as exhaustive searches of ground state structures confirmed this picture  @xcite .",
    "lj simulations generally reveal rather rich behavior , especially at finite temperature @xmath0 , in terms of local and global structures , transformations , size dependence and role of the surface  @xcite .",
    "our interest is how various structures form out of the liquid state on cooling .",
    "freezing of a liquid generally occurs through the process of nucleation .",
    "this is accomplished when one of the embryonic crystallites that appear as structural fluctuations in the liquid reaches a sufficient size to overcome the crystal - liquid surface tension that tends to shrink and eliminate small crystalline embryos .",
    "classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) forms the basis of understanding the process qualitatively and provides quantitative predictions for the rate of nucleation .",
    "central to cnt is @xmath1 , the reversible work required to form an embryo of size @xmath2 particles of the stable phase within the metastable bulk  @xcite .",
    "however , the predicted rate is highly sensitive to this work , and therefore to such considerations as the shape of the embryos , the nature of the interface and to the potentially @xmath0 and curvature dependent surface tension .",
    "the freezing of nanodroplets , i.e. , nanoclusters in their liquid form , is complicated by the fact that such small systems can often freeze into more than one structure , for example icosahaderal , decahedral or bulk - like fcc and hcp structures .",
    "and hence the nucleation process is potentially competitive in nanodroplets  @xcite .",
    "one wonders at what point during the freezing process does differentiation between structures occur and whether cnt provides a reasonable description of the rate at all .",
    "these are unresolved questions and their answers are likely system specific .",
    "one study employing simulations of gold nanoparticles found that at sufficient supercooling , cnt predicted a constant or decreasing freezing rate with further supercooling while direct simulations saw the reverse , namely an increasing rate with further cooling  @xcite .",
    "this peculiar result is connected to broader questions regarding the choice of reaction coordinate in describing the nucleation process and the resulting free energy landscape , the description of nucleation when barriers are low and the approach to a possible spinodal - like end to liquid metastability  @xcite .",
    "spinodal - like nucleation has been suggested to occur for bulk lj  @xcite , but this idea has been challenged  @xcite .    in the present study , we use molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to determine the freezing rate of a droplet consisting of 600 lj particles .",
    "we press into service the mean first - passage time ( mfpt ) formalism of reguera and co - workers  @xcite to determine the rate and critical cluster sizes over a broad range of @xmath0 .",
    "while generally for nanodroplets the surface may play a large role in determining the rate , since a large fraction of particles is near or at the surface of the droplet , crystallization for the present system occurs within the interior  @xcite .",
    "we thus expect cnt as formulated for bulk liquids to hold without the modifications often employed to describe nucleation occurring on the surface  @xcite .",
    "the previous study of this system  @xcite also revealed that several competing structures , some based on fcc tetrahedra of different sizes , exist as basins within the free energy landscape of the system .",
    "however , as the free energy was calculated as a function of global measures of surface and bulk crystallinity , little light was shed on the question of how these different structures arise .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review and discuss some aspects of cnt and mfpt , while we provide details of our simulations in section iii .",
    "we report our results in section iv , including a determination of the liquid - solid coexistence temperature , the freezing rate as a function of @xmath0 from md simulations , modelling the @xmath0 dependence of the rate through cnt , determining the free energy of crystallite formation , and an analysis of critical nuclei structure .",
    "section v provides a discussion of our results before summarizing our conclusions in section vi .",
    "according to cnt  @xcite , the rate of nucleation @xmath3 , that is to say the number of crystalline embryos that cross the critical size threshold and start to grow per unit time in the steady - state , is given by , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of molecules in the system , the zeldovich factor is @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the boltzmann constant , @xmath9 , the minimum work required to form an embryo of critical size @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the attachment rate of molecules to an embryo of size @xmath10 .",
    "we note that , at variance with eq .",
    "[ eqcntrate ] , the rate is often stated in terms of the number of nucleation events per unit time per unit volume .",
    "here we have absorbed the volume of the system into @xmath12 .",
    "the reversible work required to assemble an embryo of size @xmath2 is related to the distribution of embryo sizes in the system  @xcite , @xmath13 \\approx -\\ln \\left [ \\frac{n(n)}{n_p } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the equilibrium number of embryos of size @xmath2 in the system and @xmath15 is the total number of embryos ( including liquid - like particles ) in the system and is approximated by @xmath5 since we assume that the system is dominated by liquid - like particles , and @xmath16 is a constraint on the largest embryo size that is necessary to formally define the metastable equilibrium state .",
    "@xmath17 refers to the number of liquid - like particles in the system , while @xmath18 refers to the number of particles that are themselves crystal - like , but the neighbours of which are liquid - like . because of surface tension @xmath19 between liquid and crystal , @xmath1 is initially positively sloped and possesses a maximum at @xmath10 .",
    "the simplest model for the work of crystallite formation is  @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the difference between the chemical potentials for the bulk phase @xmath22 and the embryo phase @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a shape - dependent proportionality constant that assumes that embryos are compact , i.e. , for an embryo of volume @xmath26 , the surface area should be @xmath27 . for spherical embryos , @xmath28{36\\pi v^2}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the volume per particle in the embryonic phase . within this model , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    the simplest model for the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath12",

    "the simple modelling employed implies that the barrier to nucleation is , @xmath40 and therefore has a minimum at @xmath41 , which tends to maximize the rate , before diverging as @xmath0 approaches zero . in terms of the physical quantities @xmath33 , @xmath36 , @xmath42 , @xmath25 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the model are given by , @xmath45 @xmath46 the quantities @xmath43 , @xmath36 , @xmath44 and @xmath47 can , in principal , be obtained through fitting the rate as a function of @xmath0 with eq .",
    "[ eqstar ] .      in the present work ,",
    "as is now common in simulation studies of nucleation , we employ the size of the largest embryo in the system @xmath48 as a reaction coordinate .",
    "once an embryo definition is set , every system configuration can be uniquely assigned a value of @xmath48 , and hence the ( configurational part ) of a restricted partition function can be defined through  @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the potential energy of configuration @xmath51 , restricted to those configurations that have a largest embryo of size @xmath48 .",

    "so defined , @xmath56 is directly related to the probability that the largest cluster in the system is of size @xmath2 , given that the system is in the metastable liquid , @xmath58 , @xmath59 that is , the normalization is such that , @xmath60    for relatively large barrier heights , large embryos are rare , i.e. , there is only one large embryo in the system if there is one at all .",
    "this implies the equality of the following three quantities : the probability of there being an embryo of size @xmath2 in the system ; the probability that the largest embryo is of size @xmath2 ; and the average number of embryos of size @xmath2 .",
    "this becomes immediately obvious when constructing related histograms during the simulations . in this regime , @xmath61 ( and both are small ) .",

    "again , when barriers are high , the equalities @xmath67 and @xmath61 near @xmath10 imply that @xmath68 , and this is consistent when comparing eqs .",
    "[ eqcntrate ] and [ eqtstrate ] .",
    "however , there is no reason why this should hold when barriers become low .",

    "[ eqtstrate ] in terms of the free energy difference , @xmath71 = \\beta \\delta f^ * - \\beta \\delta f(n_{\\rm min})}.\\ ] ] this is incorrect in terms of rate prediction , as it fails to account for the phase space available in the free energy basin around @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "the identification of @xmath72 with a spinodal has been shown to be incorrect  @xcite , but it nonetheless marks the point at which the liquid system ceases to possess a basin in the free energy and has therefore lost formal metastability . for bulk systems of finite size , this marks the point at which phase change proceeds through the monotonic increase in size of the largest embryo in the system with time , i.e. , because the system is large enough , it becomes probable that it possesses an embryo of critical size as soon as diffusive particle attachment allows .",
    "phase transformation of the sample thus proceeds through growth - limited nucleation  @xcite .",
    "however , the metastable phase has not lost inherent metastability as work is still required to form an embryo . for systems such a our nanodroplets , it is perhaps not meaningful to distinguish between phase and system , but we nonetheless expect that the loss of metastability occurring at @xmath73 to be actualized through a growth - limited nucleation mechanism with a transformation rate given , at least approximately , by eq .  [ eqcntrate ] . a true kinetic spinodal , i.e. , a loss of stability on the particle level , should occur when @xmath74 vanishes .",
    "in recent times , reguera and co - workers reformulated the use of mean first - passage time from tst  @xcite in order to characterize the nucleation process in the regime where nucleation times are accessible by direct md simulations . in this mfpt formalism , when the time to crystallize is dominated by barrier crossing , the mean time at which the largest crystalline embryo in the system first reaches size @xmath2 is given by , @xmath75\\ } , \\label{eqmfpt}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 .",

    "the system consists of a single condensed droplet with a few particles at most detaching themselves from the droplet into the surrounding gas phase .",

    "part of the motivation for this work comes from previous studies on the interpretation of @xmath306 approaching zero , its relation to nucleation rates and liquid metastability and the appropriateness of using the largest embryo in the system as an order parameter .",
    "while previous work misidentified this barrier disappearance as a condition for a spinodal ( and the refutation of this pointed out its size dependence )  @xcite , it clearly signalled some sort of limit to metastability .",

    "@xcite , namely that it signals unavoidable crystallization achieved through growth - limited nucleation , is supported by our work .",
    "we add that in our case , growth - limited nucleation proceeds in an out - of - equilibrium liquid . by growth - limited nucleation",
    "we mean that with near certainty , somewhere in the system a critical nucleus will form through @xmath307 consecutive particle additions , and so crystallization is controlled by the rate at which liquid - like particles attach themselves to crystal - like ones .",

    "as formulated for homogeneous nucleation for bulk liquids works quite well .",
    "we see that a controlling factor , despite the presence of the surface , is the temperature @xmath36 at which @xmath121 in bulk systems , even though in our finite - sized system the coexistence temperature @xmath128 is significantly lower .",
    "we find that the simple modelling often used in cnt , such as constant @xmath19 , @xmath33 and @xmath25 , and arrhenius temperature dependence of @xmath11 is supported by our results in independently determining these quantities , at least for moderate supercooling .",
    "using these quantities as calculated allows us to fit the rate with a single value of @xmath222 convincingly well over a broad range of @xmath0 .",
    "there is very good consistency between thermodynamics and rates , at least for @xmath308 .",

    "this may indicate the liquid s inability to equilibrate because of sluggish dynamics , but may be at least partially driven by the weak @xmath0 dependence of @xmath10 that sets in below @xmath311 . that the system as a liquid does not reach metastable equilibrium",
    "is indicated by the potential energy time series at low @xmath0 .",
    "the ability for the liquid to undergo significant diffusive motion ( enough to form critical embryos ) while not equilibrating itself may be due to a decoupling of diffusive and collective relaxation time scales characteristic of glassy dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is slightly curious that the onset of glassy dynamics should coincide with the system size dependent @xmath311 .    as for the mc simulations , the constraint should allow for equilibration to occur since the size of the largest embryo is constrained .",
    "it is perhaps likely that relaxation of the metastable liquid requires significantly longer times than our mc of @xmath312 iterations ( @xmath313 displacement attempts per particle ) .",
    "questions about the relaxation of the liquid surrounding embryos are perhaps more easily addressed in bulk systems , where determining the dynamics of the system is somewhat more straightforward in the absence of a surface . while the increase in @xmath314 that we see at low @xmath0 may be viewed positively for the case of the spinodal scenario , the difficulties in discerning critical embryos precisely and questions regarding equilibrium must be carefully addressed .",
    "nonetheless , it is remarkable and slightly curious that the ( more ) equilibrated mc simulations at low @xmath0 should predict the rate so well through eq .",
    "[ eqcntrate ] when there is such a large difference in @xmath10 when comparing md and mc .    commenting on early work  @xcite , where the free energy was calculated as a function of @xmath97-based measures of the bulk and surface crystallinity , at @xmath96 the barrier separating",
    "the liquid from a low @xmath97 5-fold structure was @xmath315 or less ( as calculated by subtracting from the free energy of the saddle point the minimum value in the liquid basin ) , implying that the system as a liquid had ( practically ) lost stability at this @xmath0 .",
    "however , here we see that at @xmath96 , @xmath316 , which is considerably higher . thus , care must be taken when gauging phase stability from free energies based on @xmath97 , as there are crystal - like states with values of @xmath97 that overlap with those of the liquid .    in terms of structural differentiation that occurs in cluster crystallization ,",
    "the picture that emerges in our work is that pre - critical nuclei are layered hcp - fcc planes , but that ( at least ) two types of structures , with different @xmath97 values , leave the critical region .",
    "a small barrier in @xmath97 appears to separate the two , thus preventing md simulations from sampling the low @xmath97 states with twinned , five - fold structure until the embryo exceeds the critical size .",
    "it seems that small icosahedral nuclei are unfavourable , an observation that may find support in studies of small isolated lj clusters  @xcite .",
    "the lack of sampling of low @xmath97 critical states leads to disparity in determining @xmath10 in md and mc , and will make it more difficult to use the mfpt formalism to reconstruct the free energy landscape . as nucleation studied here",
    "occurs within the bulk of the cluster , perhaps a similar scenario occurs in bulk lj .",
    "we look forward to exploring these issues in more detail in the future .",

    ", the rate follows expectations from cnt under the simplest of assumptions , namely a constant ( ellipsoidal ) shape of crystallites , a constant enthalpy difference , arrhenius dependence of the attachment rate , a melting temperature following from the bulk and a constant surface tension . treating the surface tension as a fitting parameter to the rate while independently determining the other quantities results in excellent agreement from @xmath131 down to @xmath317 of the temperature dependence of the rate with cnt and of the work of forming critical nuclei with mc simulations . however , the value of the effective surface tension @xmath222 is smaller than expected .    near @xmath318 ,",
    "the rate starts approaching a maximum as the system loses its ability to maintain metastability .",
    "this is evidenced by a monotonically decreasing free energy that has as its argument the size of the largest embryo in the system . at and below this temperature ,",
    "crystallization proceeds through growth - limited nucleation in an unequilibrated liquid .",
    "the liquid phase is not inherently unstable itself , as there is a finite work required to form critical nuclei , but rather the barrier has become sufficiently small , as determined approximately by @xmath319 .",
    "this picture follows what was observed for the vapour - liquid transition  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly robust are the excellent predictions of the rate from mc - based calculations of @xmath113 , @xmath65 and @xmath11 .",
    "the predictions match the rate excellently above and below @xmath311 . above @xmath311 ,",
    "the free energy @xmath320 gives the same barrier heights as @xmath108 , given proper normalization .",
    "for our system , md and mc show discrepancies in @xmath55 , even at slight to moderate supercooling , because of the appearance of embryos with twinned structures exhibiting 5-fold symmetry .",
    "the differentiation between these and hcp - fcc stacked structures happens only in the critical region ; pre - critical nuclei do not seem to possess the 5-fold symmetry of the icosahedral structures to which lj clusters often freeze . in the critical region",
