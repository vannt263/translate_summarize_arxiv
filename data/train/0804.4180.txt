    "following the fundamental finding in @xcite that even chaotic systems can synchronize through coupling , synchronization phenomena in coupled oscillator systems have been studied extensively during the past few years , in the context of dynamical systems ( @xcite ) , control theory ( @xcite ) , complex networks ( @xcite ) , laser physics ( @xcite ) , etc . besides identical synchronization , studies have been carried out to describe other types of synchronization , such as generalized synchronization  @xcite , phase synchronization @xcite , and anticipated and lag synchronization @xcite .",
    "the simplest form of synchronization between two oscillators is the complete ( or identical ) synchronization , meaning that after a transient time , the difference between the two oscillators approaches zero .",
    "however , a more generalized form of synchronization can often occur between two non - identical systems .    in the combined state space of such systems , an invariant manifold consisting of the synchronized states , termed",
    "_ generalized synchronization manifold _ , is a central object of study in this context , and its form ( @xcite ) and stability ( @xcite ) are two important properties besides its existence .",
    "the former tells the relationship between corresponding dynamic variables in the synchronization state , and the latter determines whether a trajectory near the manifold evolves closer or farther away . while a great deal of work in synchronization focuses on identical synchronization , primarily",
    "because the synchronization manifold in this case is described simply by the identity function , much less work ( mainly on the detection of existence and stability of generalized synchronization , see @xcite ) has been carried forth on the ubiquitous generalized synchronization phenomenon , specifically because there has been little work to explicitly construct the corresponding synchronization manifold .",
    "one possibility , as reported in @xcite , is to approximate the manifold using orthogonal functions expansion .",
    "although one can simply run the system to find a portion of the generalized synchronization manifold that is covered by the attractor of the coupled system , the study of the entire manifold is still necessary and important .",
    "one reason is that the transformation from one state variable to the other that defines the manifold contains information on the correlation between the dynamics of the two systems in the whole state space , not just on the attractor",
    ". furthermore , the manifold outside the attractor may embed relevant unstable invariant sets , which can become stable as parameters change .",
    "our recent work strives to fill this gap . in this paper",
    "we present a pde ( manifold equation ) which describes the invariant manifold of generalized synchronization between two coupled oscillators as well as a variational equation regarding the transverse stability of the manifold .",
    "we also develop a time dependent pde whose stationary solution is a generalized synchronization manifold , and present straightforward numerical schemes to solve the equation .",
    "several examples , such as 1d and 2d coupled oscillators and coupled van der pol oscillators are used to illustrate our method of constructing the invariant manifold under generalized synchronization .",
    "the design of coupling in coupled system to achieve desired synchronization is also discussed by the use of the manifold equation .    in section",
    "ii , we give background regarding generalized synchronization , leading to the manifold equation together with discussion of stability of the manifold and perturbation analysis relative to the identical case . in section",
    "iii we show a specific form of the manifold equation regarding coupled oscillator system with almost the same individual dynamics and a time dependent pde used to solve for the original equation . in section iv we show some examples of invariant manifold . in section",
    "v we show how to use the manifold equation to design coupling function between two oscillators to obtain desired form of synchronization .",
    "for the discussion in this paper , consider the following equations to describe the dynamics of two non - identical oscillators @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath2 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( both @xmath9 and @xmath10 have continuous first order derivative ) .",

    "we will abbreviate this notation and just use the relationship @xmath17 to indicate the form of this manifold . to find the synchronization manifold of this coupled system , we mean to find some @xmath18 function @xmath17 ( @xmath19 ) such that @xmath20 suppose such @xmath17 exists .    then , along the synchronization manifold , @xmath21    using eq .",

    "we will leave it to the following to discuss some appropriate approaches in obtaining the solution .",

    "( [ vareq ] ) we again see the importance of the knowledge of the manifold @xmath30 . although there are approaches discussing the stability of the synchronization manifold without knowing explicitly the form of the manifold , it will be more natural and convenient to study the stability directly with the knowledge of the form of the synchronization manifold .    in this paper , we will focus on the form of the invariant manifold . the detailed discussion regarding the stability of the invariant manifold under generalized synchronization",
    "will be reported in the future work .",

    "[ nonidsys ] there is a small mismatch in the parameters : @xmath36 .",

    "we empirically expect the synchronization manifold to have the form @xmath38 the main interest will be to find @xmath39 and thus we will have a first order approximation for the synchronization manifold . following the similar procedure to the derivation of the manifold eq .",

    "in the previous section we derived the general equation for the synchronization manifold of non - identical oscillators as well as the corresponding variational equation for the study of stability of the manifold . we conclude that in order for such transformation @xmath15 to exist when @xmath41 , ( i.e. , @xmath17 is a stationary solution of eq .",
    "[ tdpde ] when @xmath42 is sufficiently large ) @xmath17 has to satisfy eq .",

    "so the problem of finding the invariant manifold reduces to finding the solution of the pde  ( [ mfeq ] ) with appropriate boundary conditions .    however , the boundary condition for eq .",
    "( [ mfeq ] ) is not easily attainable without actually solving the original ode system .",
    "there may exist more than one synchronization manifolds in general , if none of them is globally stable .",
    "our main interest in this paper is to use the perturbed manifold equation ( [ epmf ] ) to find the closest one to the identical manifold , which tells us how the form of synchronization changes if the two oscillators are not perfectly the same .      in order to develop a workable numerical scheme to solve the manifold equation ( [ mfeq ] ) ,",
    "we first derive an evolution equation for a mapping relating the coordinates @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the two systems obeying ( [ nonidsys ] ) .",
    "the idea is that if we start with a reasonable initial guess for the mapping and evolve it according to the dynamics of the coupled system , the mapping would approach the synchronization manifold , provided that the manifold is asymptotically stable .",
    "indeed , the synchronization manifold turns out to be a stationary solution of the evolution equation , whose stability mirrors exactly the stability of the synchronized systems .",

    "there is one issue for implementing the iteration ( [ 2ddisit ] ) : the values on the boundary of the domain is difficult to compute in general .",

    "start by assigning values at all points in a initial domain that is much larger than the domain of interest .",
    "then the iteration is defined properly at all interior points , but not on the boundary , so we make the domain smaller by discarding all boundary points for the next iteration . repeating this process , we produce a sequence of domains of decreasing size on which successively better approximation of the synchronization manifold is obtained . by taking the initial domain to be large enough so that the iteration converges before the domain becomes smaller than the original domain of interest , we obtain an approximate solution on the entire domain of interest",
    ".    intuitively , this method works by choosing the boundary of the computational domain to dynamically change with the propagation wave front of the effect of the boundary of the initial domain .",
    "since the solution at a given fixed point in the domain will not be affected by the choice of values on the boundary of the initial domain until this wave front reaches the point , any point that remains in our shrinking domain should not be affected by the choice boundary condition on the initial domain .",
    "the influence of the unknown boundary condition of the outer domain becomes progressively less important as time progresses and the inner domain shrinks .",
    "as we discussed in the previous sections , the manifold equation ( [ mfeq ] ) is important because it allows further study of the synchronization between coupled oscillators . in this section",
    "we show several examples of constructing a generalized synchronization manifold .",
    "in particular , we consider examples in which the dynamics of the two oscillators are different but only with minor difference .",
    "a motivation for the study of this special case is that in any real dynamical systems no oscillator is physically perfect in the sense that the parameters or even the structure we use to mold these oscillators bear some small error .",
    "one - dimensional examples provide an excellent starting point of investigation for studying invariant manifolds for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "consider a simple case where @xmath97 we couple this oscillator with another one , but with some perturbation function on it so that the two oscillators are not identical : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is any smooth function and @xmath100 denotes its derivative . here",
    "the @xmath101 term represents the one - way coupling from @xmath102 to @xmath103 and the @xmath104 term represents some small perturbation on the @xmath103 oscillator .",
    "note that when @xmath105 the synchronization manifold is @xmath106 , which is stable .",
    "this oscillator is designed to have @xmath107 as a stable invariant manifold , which can be checked by introducing an appropriate change of coordinates .",
    "this type of oscillator always results in an intrinsic relationship between @xmath102 and @xmath103 subcomponent , given by @xmath108 .",
    "for example , if let @xmath109 , then we have @xmath110 now for @xmath111 , the invariant manifold @xmath112 is determined by the manifold equation ( [ mfeq ] ) , which yields @xmath113 this equation is a simple ode that can be solved analytically using the multiplication factor method .",
    "the solution is @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a constant that is determined by the boundary condition . in this family of invariant manifolds , the only one that corresponds to the perturbation of the identical synchronization ( @xmath116 when @xmath37 )",

    "the manifold can also be obtained by using the iteration scheme we described in the previous section : suppose the form of the manifold @xmath121 . to find @xmath39 we look for the corresponding stationary solution of the pde described by ( [ pdeh ] ) .",

    "we expect the corresponding @xmath102 components to synchronize identically , while the form of synchronization of the @xmath103 component can depend on the choice of @xmath51 and @xmath99 .",

    "the coupled system becomes @xmath210 where @xmath39 is a coupling matrix ( known in advance ) and @xmath195 is the unknown coupling function of @xmath0 that needs to be determined . by eq .",
    "( [ cpddfos2 ] ) and ( [ cplfunc3 ] ) , we find that : @xmath211 here we see that only when @xmath209 we can allow @xmath212 and yield identical synchronization , otherwise the coupling form of @xmath102 and @xmath103 shall be different to compensate for the difference of the original dynamics on @xmath102 and @xmath103 respectively .",
    "the stability of the manifold is described by @xmath213 following eq .",
    "( [ vareq2 ] ) . in order for the synchronization manifold to be stable , we need @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the spectral radius of the matrix @xmath216 .",
    "eq.s  ( [ lncpl ] ) , ( [ lnvar ] ) and ( [ lnlmd ] ) gives us a way to easily manipulate the coupling functions in the non - identical linear systems to obtain stable identical synchronization . with minor modifications we can obtain similar results for two - way coupling , and with a few more modifications as well as more analysis we shall be able to control more complicated systems",
    "in this paper we have developed systematic methods for explicit construction of generalized synchronization manifolds in systems of coupled non - identical oscillators by means of the manifold equation , a pde that must be satisfied by the manifold , and the associated variational equation describing its stability .",
    "although the manifold equation gives necessary condition to determine the invariant manifold , it is not sufficient , mainly due to the fact that boundary conditions for this pde are not easily attainable . to obtain a solution of the manifold equation without knowing explicitly the boundary conditions , we have proposed a time dependent pde whose stably stationary solution is a solution of the manifold equation , and developed iteration schemes to solve it both symbolically and numerically .",
    "several examples of constructing synchronization manifolds have been given for systems of nearly identical oscillators ( considered as a perturbed version of identical oscillators , which correspond to complete synchronization ) with unidirectional coupling , where we obtained the first order approximation of the perturbed manifold . a general technique for using the manifold equation to design the coupling for the purpose of controlling the form and stability of synchronization has also been discussed and illustrated using the simple case of linear systems .",
    "our numerical algorithms used to obtain the stationary solution of the time dependent pde is analogous to the euler method in a functional space , whose convergence is not necessarily global .",
    "thus , finding a systematic method to choose an appropriate initial condition , as well as a detailed convergence analysis for the scheme , is an important problem that must be addressed in the future .",
    "as there exists a variety of different schemes to solve pdes in the literature , exploring and comparing with other numerical schemes for solving the manifold equation is another important topic of future research .",

    "in the coupld van der pol system ( [ cpdvanderpol1 ] ) , in order to obtain the first order approximation of the synchronization manifold in @xmath51 , we neglect higher order terms in @xmath51 and write @xmath217 thus , using eq .",
