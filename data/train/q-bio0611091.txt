    "mathematical models of predator - prey or parasite - host interaction and epidemiological models formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) share the same framework of modeling .",
    "the principles of these models , balance relations and decomposition of the rates of change into birth and death processes , which were applied since publications of lotka - volterra equations @xcite and ode @xmath0-model of kermack and mckendrick @xcite , have remained valid until today .",
    "modifications were limited to replacing growth , death , and transmission rates by more complex functions , other types of functional responses , density - dependent mortality rates , or modes of pathogen transmission other than mass action kinetics .    in a number of cases",
    "different population models possess a distinct similar feature that complicates the analysis of the models ; namely , a number of models are not defined at a singular point . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that this point is the origin @xmath1 .",
    "the models we consider in the present paper are formulated in such a way that this singularity is removable , for example , we can get rid of it by a time change . after the time change a topologically equivalent dynamical system in @xmath2 is obtained , where @xmath3 , which is a natural state space for biologically motivated models .",
    "the origin @xmath1 becomes a well defined equilibrium for this dynamical system .",
    "sometimes , however , the usual approach by linearization fails to infer the structure of a neighborhood of @xmath1 because the origin is a non - hyperbolic equilibrium for any parameter values ( i.e. , this point has both eigenvalues equal zero ) .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to describe completely the possible structures of a small neighborhood @xmath4 of non - hyperbolic equilibrium point @xmath1 in case of a particular class of differential equations that includes many biological models .",
    "we also present an algorithm to analyze such equations in @xmath4 and apply this algorithm to a number of mathematical models .",
    "in particular , we show that the models under consideration can possess a dynamical regime of deterministic extinction , which is crucially important from the biological standpoint .",
    "this regime corresponds to the presence of a family of homoclinics to the origin , so - called elliptic sector .",
    "we note that the fine structure of the phase plane containing the elliptic sector was sometimes overlooked in the analysis of these models .    more specifically , we analyze non - hyperbolic equilibrium @xmath1 of the following system of odes : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are homogeneous polynomials of the second order : @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e. , their taylor series start with terms of order three or higher .",
    "it is important to stress that many of the global properties of the models with the discussed peculiarity are determined by the properties of equilibrium @xmath1 , and , therefore , it is essential to know the exact structure of a neighborhood of this point and dependence of this structure on the model parameters .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : section 2 is devoted to examples of biologically motivated models , which , after a suitable time change , fall into the class of differential equations ; in section 3 we introduce the basic definitions and notations and state the main theorems that describe possible topological structures of the origin of system ; here we also present an algorithm to study the structure of @xmath4 of @xmath1 ; in section 4 , using the algorithm from section 3 , we analyze some mathematical models , mainly those introduced in section 2 ; section 5 contains discussion and conclusions ; finally , proofs of some mathematical statements are given in appendix .",

    "<S> a class of models of biological population and communities with a singular equilibrium at the origin is analyzed ; it is shown that these models can possess a dynamical regime of deterministic extinction , which is crucially important from the biological standpoint . </S>",
    "<S> this regime corresponds to the presence of a family of homoclinics to the origin , so - called elliptic sector . </S>",
    "<S> the complete analysis of possible topological structures in a neighborhood of the origin , as well as asymptotics to orbits tending to this point , is given . </S>",
    "<S> an algorithmic approach to analyze system behavior with parameter changes is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the developed methods and algorithm are applied to existing mathematical models of biological systems . in particular , we analyze a model of anticancer treatment with oncolytic viruses , a parasite - host interaction model , and a model of chagas disease .
