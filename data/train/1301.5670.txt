    "this work is motivated by the problem of understanding the topology of the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature ( _ psc - metrics _ ) on the sphere @xmath1 . this space is denoted @xmath2 and is an open subspace of the space of all riemannian metrics on @xmath1 , @xmath7 , equipped with its standard smooth topology .",
    "it is known that when @xmath8 , the space @xmath2 is contractible ; see @xcite . when @xmath5 , we know from a recent result of marques that this space is path connected ; see @xcite .",
    "in fact it is thought by experts that the space is contractible in this case also .",
    "when @xmath9 however , the space @xmath10 is usually not path connected ; see for example @xcite .",
    "furthermore for @xmath11 , the groups @xmath12 are often non - trivial ; see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we make the following contribution",
    ".    * main results . *    _ _    1 .   when @xmath0 , the space @xmath2 is homotopy equivalent to a subspace which admits a homotopy product ( i.e. is an @xmath3-space )",
    ". furthermore this product is homotopy commutative and homotopy associative .",
    "when @xmath5 or @xmath6 , the space @xmath2 is weakly homotopy equivalent to an @xmath4-fold loop space .",
    "definitions of the terms @xmath3-space and loop space are given in section [ hdefn ] .",
    "we will not discuss the topological implications of such structure on @xmath2 other than to point out that the condition that a topological space is an @xmath3-space , or especially an iterated loop space , imposes significant restrictions on its homotopy type . for more on this , see chapter 4 of @xcite .",
    "the main idea is as follows .",
    "we specify certain subspaces of @xmath2 consisting of psc - metrics which take a  standard form \" near a fixed base point @xmath13 .",
    "it is known from results in @xcite that these subspaces are all homotopy equivalent to the space @xmath2 .",
    "we then construct products on these spaces , in the case where @xmath0 , based on the gromov - lawson connected sum construction in @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , these products involve removing standard  caps \" around the point @xmath14 of the factor metrics and then taking a connected sum via some appropriate connecting metric .",
    "there is one important caveat .",
    "we need to ensure that the metric obtained by this product has a base point , something which the individual factors lose once we remove the standard caps .",
    "hence we use , as an intermediary metric , a psc - metric on the sphere containing @xmath15 such standard caps , two of which will be removed for the attachments and the third which will be a base point cap . in all cases , we will show that this determines a homotopy product ( i.e. makes the subspace an @xmath3-space ) which is homotopy commutative and homotopy associative .",
    "we then focus on one such subspace of @xmath2 : the space of psc - metrics which take the form of a round hemisphere of radius @xmath16 near a fixed base point @xmath14 , denoted @xmath17 . on this space",
    ", we show that the homotopy product generalises to an action of a certain operad .",
    "this operad is obtained via a process called the bar construction , from the _ operad of little @xmath4-dimensional disks _ ; see below for a description of this object and the bar construction .",
    "it follows from results of boardman , vogt and may that a space @xmath18 which admits such an action is weakly homotopy equivalent to an @xmath4-fold loop space , provided @xmath18 is group - like ( the induced multiplication on @xmath19 gives it the structure of a group . )    thus , to demonstrate that @xmath2 is weakly homotopic to an @xmath4-fold loop space , it remains to show that @xmath17 is group - like .",
    "although our action is defined when @xmath0 , we show that @xmath17 is group - like only when @xmath5 or @xmath6 . in proving this ,",
    "we make use of a recent theorem by botvinnik , theorem b. of @xcite , concerning isotopy and concordance of psc - metrics .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath5 or @xmath6 stems from the fact that botvinnik s theorem is false when @xmath20 . whether or not the same is true of our result is unknown .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . after recalling the defintions of an @xmath3-space and a loop space in section [ hdefn ] ,",
    "we proceed in section [ disksphere ] to describe two types of psc - metric on the disk which are well - behaved near the boundary .",
    "roughly , these are metrics which are either cylindrical or sphere - like near the boundary and may be appropriately combined to obtain psc - metrics on the sphere . in later sections we make use of this in specifying product structures on certain subspaces of psc - metrics on the sphere which are standard near a fixed base point . in particular , in section [ torpconn ] , we consider the most elementary of these subspaces : the space of psc - metrics on @xmath1 which have a  torpedo cap \" around some fixed base point @xmath13 .",
    "we denote this space @xmath21 . after specifying a multiplication map on this space ,",
    "we review the gromov - lawson connected sum construction as generalised in @xcite for compact families of psc - metrics .",
    "in particular , we show in lemma [ homequivspaces ] , that the subspace of psc - metrics on @xmath1 which have torpedo caps at a fixed base point is actually homotopy equivalent , when @xmath0 , to the space of all psc - metrics on @xmath1 . in section [ hspacethm3 ]",
    "we prove the first of our main results : the @xmath3-space theorem .",
    "this is theorem [ htheorem ] , where we show that the multiplication map discussed above gives the space @xmath21 the structure of an @xmath3-space .",
    "we also show that the product is both homotopy commutative and homotopy associative .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is homotopy equivalent to an @xmath3-space when @xmath0 .",
    "a minor consequence , corollary [ abfg ] , is that the fundamental group of @xmath2 , with base point the standard round metric , is abelian .    in section [ bulbsection ] ,",
    "we describe slightly more sophisticated subspaces of @xmath2 , consisting of psc - metrics which have the form of  bulbs \" and  heads \" near a base point @xmath13 .",
    "these spaces , denoted @xmath22 and @xmath23 are shown also to be homotopy equivalent to @xmath2 in lemma [ bulbdefret ] .",
    "we then define multiplication maps , analogous to the one above , which give these spaces an @xmath3-space structure . in the case of @xmath23 , there is a deformation retract down to the subspace @xmath17 , of psc - metrics which take the form of a round hemisphere of radius @xmath16 near @xmath14 . on this space",
    ", we will show that the homotopy product generalises nicely to a certain operad action . before doing this",
    ", we spend some time in section [ operadsection ] reviewing the various operads we will require . in particular , we consider the operad of little @xmath4-dimensional disks @xmath24 ( as well as a variant of this operad the round hemisphere ) and the bar construction for operads .",
    "we recall relevant results of boardman , vogt and may : theorems [ bvthm ] and [ bvm ] .",
    "these results allow us to conclude that the existence of an appropriate action of the operad @xmath25 , obtained from @xmath26 via the bar construction , on a group - like space @xmath18 implies that @xmath18 is weakly homotopy equivalent to an @xmath4-fold loop space . in section [ dspace ]",
    "we exhibit , for @xmath0 , precisely such an action on the space @xmath17 .",
    "this is lemma [ actionlemma ] .",
    "finally , in section [ grouplike ] , we demonstrate that @xmath17 is indeed group - like in the case when @xmath5 or @xmath27 ; see lemma [ pi0group ] . here",
    "we make great use of a recent theorem of botvinnik from @xcite concerning psc - concordance .",
    "this allows us to conclude the main result , theorm [ loopthm ] .",
    "i would like to thank boris botvinnik at the university of oregon for suggesting this problem , kirk lancaster and philip parker at wichita state university , david wraith at nui maynooth , ireland , and especially victor turchin at kansas state university , for some helpful conversations .",
    "a topological space @xmath18 is a _ @xmath3-space _",
    "if @xmath18 is equipped with a continuous multiplication map @xmath28 and an identity element @xmath29 so that the maps from @xmath18 to @xmath18 given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 are both homotopy equivalent to the identity map @xmath32",
    ". there are stronger versions of this definition where the above homotopies to the identity map are required to be homotopic through pointed maps @xmath33 or where multiplication by the identity is the identity map .",
    "it is well known that in the case when @xmath18 is homotopy equivalent to a cw complex , @xmath18 admits a product which agrees with one of these definitions if and only if it admits products agreeing with the other two ; see chapter 3.c of @xcite .",
    "moreover , it follows from the work of palais in @xcite that for any smooth compact manifold @xmath34 , @xmath35 is homotopy equivalent to a cw complex .",
    "thus , we feel justified in using the weaker definition .",
    "an @xmath3-space @xmath18 is said to be homotopy commutative if the maps @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the  flip \" map defined @xmath39 , are homotopy equivalent .",
    "finally , @xmath18 is a homotopy associative @xmath3-space if the maps from @xmath40 to @xmath18 given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 are homotopy equivalent .    given a topological space @xmath18 with a prescribed base point @xmath43 , we may consider the space of all loops based at @xmath44 .",
    "this is the space of all continuous maps @xmath45\\rightarrow z$ ] so that @xmath46 .",
    "this space is known as the _ loop space of @xmath18 _ , denoted @xmath47 , with base point the constant loop at @xmath44 . assuming the base point to be understood , we simply write @xmath48 . repeated application of this construction yields the k - th iterated loop space @xmath49 where at each stage the new base point is simply the constant loop at the old base point .",
    "we close by pointing out that a loop space is also an @xmath3-space with the multiplication determined by concatenation of loops . whether or not a given @xmath3-space has the structure of a loop space is a more complicated problem concerning certain  coherence \" conditions on the homotopy associativity of the multiplication .",
    "it is a theorem of stasheff that a space satisfies these conditions , is a so - called @xmath50-space , if and only if it is a loop space ; see theorem 4.18 in @xcite .",
    "the notion of an _ operad _ was constructed to more efficiently describe these coherence conditions , something we will return to in section [ operadsection ] .",
    "for a smooth @xmath4-dimensional manifold @xmath51 , possibly with non - empty boundary , we denote by @xmath52 the space of riemannian metrics on @xmath51 equipped with its standard @xmath53-topology ; see section 1.1 of @xcite for a description",
    ". contained inside @xmath52 as an open subspace is the space of psc - metrics on @xmath51 , denoted @xmath54 .",
    "a path in this space is known as a _ psc - isotopy _ while metrics which lie in the same path component are said to be _ psc - isotopic_. in the case when @xmath55 , it is common to consider only a subspace of @xmath54 of metrics which satisfy some constraint near the boundary .",
    "we will need such a constraint in this paper also and will return to this issue shortly .",
    "we will mostly focus on the case when @xmath51 is either @xmath56 or @xmath1 , the standard smooth disk or sphere of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "usually @xmath4 is assumed to be at least three .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 , the standard round metric of radius @xmath16 on @xmath1 . as smooth topological objects , we model the disk @xmath58 as the set of points @xmath59 and the sphere @xmath60 as the set @xmath61 . in constructing metrics on these spaces , we will often work on an underlying disk or sphere @xmath62 or @xmath63 where the radius @xmath64 .",
    "the re - scaling function @xmath65 gives a canonical way of pulling back metrics to the standard disk or sphere .",
    "thus , we will often declare a metric which has been constructed on a general @xmath62 or @xmath63 to a be a metric on @xmath56 or @xmath1 assuming the metric to be pulled back in this way .",
    "finally , we respectively denote by @xmath66 and @xmath67 the spaces @xmath68 and @xmath69 , i.e. the southern and northern hemispheres of @xmath1 .",
    "these hemispheres will be identified with the disk @xmath56 via the obvious map which sends geodesic rays emanating from the points @xmath70 to the corresponding ray on the flat disk @xmath71 followed by the above rescaling map .",
    "we now return to the question of boundary conditions on certain metrics .",
    "our various constructions will involve attaching riemannian disks along their boundaries to obtain new metrics on the sphere .",
    "on the smooth topological level , this involves gluing a pair disks together by identifying the boundary spheres via some diffeomorphism of @xmath72 . in our case ,",
    "the boundary sphere is canonically identified with the standard unit @xmath73-sphere in @xmath74 and we always assume that we are gluing with the identity diffeomorphism . of course",
    ", we need to ensure smooth attachment at the metric level .",
    "there are two ways of doing this which we will explore .",
    "the first is to work only with metrics which take the form of a round cylinder near or at least infinitesimally at , the boundary .",
    "the second is to consider metrics which , near their boundaries , agree with a geodesic ball from a round sphere ( for example a hemisphere ) near its boundary , at least infinitesimally ; see fig .",

    "we specify a subspace @xmath75 as follows .",
    "beginning with the disk @xmath56 , let @xmath76 and consider @xmath58 as a submanifold of the disk of radius @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",

    "we now consider a pair of psc - metrics @xmath86 .",
    "these metrics are very well behaved along the boundary .",
    "indeed the only obstruction to simply gluing them together in the usual way is that the radii of their boundary spheres may not agree .",
    "there are two obvious ways we might proceed .",
    "the simplest is to simply rescale one or both of these metrics ( multiplying the metric by an appropriate constant ) so that the boundaries are compatible . alternatively , one may wish to leave @xmath87 and @xmath88 unscathed and connect them via an appropriate warped round cylinder metric whose ends correspond to the respective boundaries .",
    "this second method seems a little cumbersome , but has the advantage that it does not require a global adjustment of @xmath87 or @xmath88 . for our purposes",
    "however , the rescaling method will suffice .",
    "we begin with an elementary fact . for any riemannian metric @xmath89 on a smooth @xmath4-dimensional manifold @xmath51",
    ", the scalar curvature @xmath90 of the metric @xmath91 obtained by multiplying @xmath89 by a constant @xmath92 is given by the formula : @xmath93 thus , rescaling a psc - metric by a positive constant results in another psc - metric .",
    "we now define the function @xmath94 , the _ radius measuring map _ as follows : @xmath95 let @xmath96 be any function @xmath97 .",

    "a related notion , which we will make use of shortly is the notion of _ psc - concordance_. in the case of metrics @xmath818 , we say that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are _ psc - concordant _ if there is a psc - metric @xmath819 on @xmath820 which near @xmath821 takes the form of a product @xmath822 and near @xmath823 takes the form @xmath824 .",

    "it is worth noting that the hypothesis that @xmath4 be at least five can not be removed as the above result fails to be true when @xmath20 ; see @xcite . in the case",
    "when @xmath5 , it is demonstrated by marques in @xcite that the space @xmath2 is path connected , and so botvinnik s theorem holds here for trivial reasons .",

    "it is an easy corollary of lemma [ bulblemma ] that this induces a well defined binary operation on @xmath764 .",
    "verifying that the various group axioms hold is mostly straightforward . in particular",
    ", it is clear that the class containing the standard round metric , @xmath828 $ ] , is the identity .",
    "the only difficult lies in verifying that each element has an inverse . to see this we briefly return to the notion of psc - concordance .",
    "gajer in @xcite shows that the set of concordance classes of @xmath2 , which we denote @xmath829 , forms a group also under the operation induced by connected sum .",
    "we wo nt reprove it here but it is worth briefly recounting gajer s method for showing that each concordance class has an inverse , as we will make good use of it .",

    "next , we use the gromov - lawson method to push out a torpedo cap away from this neighbourhood and preserve positive scalar curvature . by first removing the cap part , then removing the previously constructed",

    "we have a standard round metric of radius @xmath228 . at the other end",
    "we have the psc - metric @xmath835 obtained by taking a connected sum of @xmath89 and @xmath836 . here",
    "@xmath836 is isometric to @xmath89 but via an orientation reversing isometry . in theorem 2.2 of @xcite",
    ", we show in great detail how to adjust a psc - metric on a manifold with boundary in precisely this situation in order to obtain a psc - metric which has a product structure near the boundary .",
    "on performing such an adjustment we obtain a psc - concordance between @xmath837 and @xmath835 and thus between @xmath57 and @xmath835 .",
    "thus the classes containing @xmath89 and @xmath836 are inverses in the group @xmath829 .          to show that @xmath89 and @xmath836 represent inverse elements in @xmath817",
    ", we need only show that as well as being psc - concordant , the round metric and the connected sum of @xmath89 and @xmath836 are also psc - isotopic . that these metrics are indeed psc - isotopic when @xmath6 follows of course from the aforementioned theorem of botvinnik , theorem b. of @xcite .",
    "the inclusion @xmath840 gives a bijection between @xmath839 and @xmath764 .",
    "the corollary then follows from the fact that the intermediary metric @xmath293 , used in determining the product @xmath554 , is isotopic to the standard round metric .",
    "this means metrics resulting from this product are easily deformed by psc - isotopy to a regular gromov - lawson style connected sum , and so the two operations behave in the same way with regard to path components .          we know from lemma [ homequivspaces ] and lemma [ bulbdefret ] that when @xmath408 , the spaces @xmath2 and @xmath17 are homotopy equivalent .",
