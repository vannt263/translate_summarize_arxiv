    "in @xmath6cdm cosmology , galaxies like the milky way are formed through the stochastic accretion of smaller dark matter halos and the continuous accretion of gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "on the other hand , no model has yet self - consistently incorporated the gas dynamics , star formation , and feedback necessary to satisfactorily reproduce the formation of milky way analogs . in any case , an understanding of the statistical properties of the accretion histories of milky way analogs does not predict the unique formation history of the milky way . fortunately , the dynamical and chemical properties of the milky way s thin disk , thick disk , bulge , and halo provide strong constraints on the formation of our own galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the kinematics of the stellar halo of the milky way are simpler to describe than the kinematics of other galactic components . as a result , the stellar halo is the galactic component in which it is easiest to unambiguously identify the remnants of the smaller halos that the milky way has accreted through its history .",
    "for that reason , the substructures recently discovered in the halo provide a direct measure of accretion in the region of the galaxy that is far easier to model than the disk or the bulge .",

    "* ) ; these observed substructures are likely the remains of the stellar populations that formed as part of independent , bound structures that are now being disrupted and dispersed in the halo .    in the first paper in this series , @xcite hereafter  we identified elements of cold halo substructure ( echos ) as overdensities in the spatial and radial velocity distribution of the inner halo s stellar population . except for those echos identified along lines of sight",
    "known to host surface brightness substructure , none of our echos are detected as overdensities of stars in surface brightness substructure . as a result , they are distinct from surface brightness substructure and are likely the debris of more ancient accretion events .",
    "we used our detections to infer that as much as 10% of the inner halo by volume might have 30% of its stars in echos , and we used that measurement together with similar measurements for surface brightness substructure to suggest that the milky way s accretion history has been roughly constant over the last few gyr with no massive ( @xmath8 ) single accretion events in that interval .",
    "moreover , the distribution of echos in galactic coordinates is consistent with isotropy given the completeness limits of our search , possibly indicating an accretion origin for echos ( rather than an association with the galactic disk ) .",
    "the chemical composition of the milky way s stellar populations also illuminate their origin ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in general , since iron is introduced into the interstellar medium in supernovae ( sn ) explosions , the [ fe / h ] of a stellar population is correlated with the total integrated star formation that occurred in that population .",
    "qualitatively then , low [ fe / h ] indicates relatively little integrated star formation , while high [ fe / h ] indicates relatively more integrated star formation . if the initial mass function ( imf ) of stellar populations is not a strong function of environment or metallicity at [ fe / h ] @xmath9 ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , then a stellar population s abundances of the @xmath0-elements ( o , mg , si , ca , and ti ) relative to iron are related to the duration of the star formation that produced that population .",
    "core - collapse ( i.e. , type ii and type ibc ) sn result from the explosions of stars initially more massive than about @xmath10 and produce large amounts of the @xmath0-elements relative to iron .",
    "since stars that massive spend very little time on the main sequence , the enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by the ejecta from core - collapse sn occurs very quickly , within a few myr . in contrast , thermonuclear ( i.e. , type ia ) sn result from the explosion of white dwarfs as a result of runaway nuclear burning and produce large amounts of iron relative to the @xmath0-elements .",
    "the exact progenitor and therefore the characteristic timescale on which thermonuclear sn start to enrich the ism is still debated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ; nevertheless , the timescale is longer than the comparable time to ism enrichment through core - collapse sn . for those reasons ,",
    "a short burst of star formation will leave behind a stellar population with [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath11 , while a more extended star formation history will produce a population with [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath12 ( neglecting any differences in the imf ) . accordingly",
    ", a lower star formation rate will allow thermonuclear sn to reduce [ @xmath0/fe ] at relatively low [ fe / h ] , whereas a high star formation rate will produce many generations of stars before thermonuclear sn begin to reduce [ @xmath0/fe ] , pushing the  knee \" in the [ fe / h][@xmath0/fe ] plane to higher [ fe / h ] .",

    "since echos are likely the remains of recent accretion events ( @xmath16 gyr ) , their chemical composition constrains the properties of a more recently - disrupted class of contributors to the stellar population of the inner halo than the few massive progenitors that contributed the bulk of the inner halo s stellar population . if echos are the remains of disrupted dsph galaxies , then the dsph luminosity ",

    "we discuss the implications of our findings for the formation of the milky way .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) survey observed approximately 240,000 milky way stars with apparent magnitudes in the range @xmath19 with the fiber - fed sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spectrograph at moderate resolution .",
    "spectroscopic targets were selected from the combined 11,663 deg@xmath20 @xmath21 photometric footprint of the sdss and segue .",
    "the sdss telescope and spectrograph obtain @xmath22 spectra between 3900   and 9000   with high spectrophotometric accuracy .",
    "the segue instrumentation , data processing pipelines , survey strategy , along with radial velocity and atmospheric parameter accuracies are described in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the sdss - ii dr7 paper @xcite .",
    "the sdss survey is described in detail in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in we examined a sample of 10,739 metal - poor main sequence turnoff stars collected from 137 seven deg@xmath20 lines of sight .",
    "these metal - poor main sequence turnoff ( mpmsto ) stars have both the @xmath23 color and significant uv excess expected for the main sequence turnoff of a metal - poor population ( for a detailed description of the mpmsto sample see section 2 of ) .",
    "given the magnitude limits of the segue survey , the mpmsto sample was selected because mpmsto stars are the highest - density tracer of the inner halo . in , we defined the inner halo as the volume more than 10 kpc from the galactic center , within 17.5 kpc of the sun , and more than 4 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "though we found no reason to reject a kinematically smooth model for the inner halo on average , we discovered many radial velocity overdensities that we termed echos .",
    "we identified echos along individual lines of sight along which there was a very significant deviation from a kinematically smooth model of the inner halo .",
    "we gave these substructure the name echos to differentiate them from surface brightness substructure like tidal streams , as the only echos we could relate to surface brightness substructures were those echos discovered along lines of sight targeted at known surface brightness substructures .",
    "echos are also distinct in that they are likely related to more ancient accretion events than surface brightness substructure in the same volume ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the same time , echos are likely related to more recent accretion events than those substructures that will be discovered in the same volume using the 6d kinematic data that will become available from gaia and the lsst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the echos we discovered were preferentially bunched at the faintest apparent magnitudes of the segue spectroscopic sample ; indeed the 25% , 50% , and 75% percentile in @xmath24-magnitude and spectral signal to noise per 1   pixel ( abbreviated s / n hereafter ) were ( 19.0,19.5,19.8 ) and ( 7.6,10.4,15.4 ) respectively . as a result ,",
    "the spectra of individual mpmsto stars were generally at too low a s / n to precisely measure abundances .",
    "we coadd all stellar spectra kinematically associated with an echos in a narrow range of effective temperature and analyze the resultant coadded spectrum to determine the average abundance of the echos . at the same time",
    ", we use an equivalent coaddition process to determine the average metallicity of the mpmsto stars in the kinematically smooth inner halo population along the same line of sight .",
    "we use these measurements to compare the mean chemical abundance of the echos and smooth halo population .",
    "both calculations are subject to the same systematics , so any apparent chemical offset can only result from an underlying chemical difference or from random effects . to quantify the effects of randomness , we compute the precision and accuracy of our technique by analyzing two classes of objects with known composition .",
    "the first class of objects are individual mpmsto stars that have been observed both at high s / n during the segue survey and at high resolution by larger telescopes .",
    "the high s / n segue spectra can be degraded to arbitrarily low s / n by a detailed noise model so that we can test the coaddition process with data representative of the low s / n spectra available for mpmsto stars in echos .",
    "the second class of objects are mpmsto stars associated with the globular clusters m  13 and m  15 . using those two test cases ,",
    "we quantify the mean square error ( mse @xmath25 bias@xmath20 + variance ) of our metallicity estimates .",
    "we describe these steps in detail in the following subsections .      the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp - * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) uses sloan spectroscopy and @xmath21 photometry to infer the stellar atmosphere parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , [ fe / h ] , and [ @xmath0/fe ] ) of stars observed in the course of sdss and segue .",
    "the sspp implements a multimethod algorithm in which many different techniques are used to compute the stellar parameters .",
    "the sspp then averages the result of each method known to be valid in a given color and s / n range to determine the final @xmath26 , @xmath27 , [ fe / h ] , and [ @xmath0/fe ] reported for all stars observed in the sdss and segue surveys .",
    "@xcite determined the accuracy and precision of the sspp in three ways .",
    "first , they compared the atmospheric parameters determined by the sspp from high s / n segue spectra with the atmospheric parameters determined from high - resolution spectroscopy from hires and esi on the keck telescopes , hrs on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , and hds on the subaru telescope .",
    "their results suggest that including both systematic and random error , the sspp has a one - sigma precision of 141 k in @xmath26 , 0.23 dex in @xmath27 , and 0.23 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "the stars bright enough to be observed at high resolution all had s / n @xmath28 segue spectra , so direct comparison with high - resolution spectra can only be made for high s / n spectra .",
    "for that reason , they degraded these high s / n segue spectra with stellar parameters well characterized by high - resolution spectroscopy with a detailed noise model to create many thousand spectra at many values of s / n between 55 and 1 .",
    "they then ran the sspp on the noise - degraded spectra to determine the accuracy and precision of the sspp as a function of s / n and reported the result in in table 6 of @xcite .",
    "they found a [ fe / h ] precision of ( 0.5,0.2,0.1 ) dex at s / n of ( 5,10,15 ) and a [ @xmath0/fe ] precision of 0.1 dex at s / n greater than 20 @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite applied the sspp to stars associated with open and globular clusters , where they found that the sspp achieves a precision in [ fe / h ] of 0.13 dex over the range @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 [ fe / h ] @xmath32 .",
    "we include in the coadded spectra only those spectra that correspond to mpmsto stars with radial velocities that indicate membership in the population of interest .",
    "in addition , we include in the coadded spectra only those spectra that correspond to mpmsto stars in a finite range of effective temperature , as the strength of spectral lines is affected by temperature as well as [ fe / h ] .",
    "consequently , the @xmath26 range has to be small enough to ensure that the coadd gives an accurate [ fe / h ] that is representative of the population . in order to estimate the effective temperature of a mpmsto star from its @xmath23 color",
    ", we fit a linear model between @xmath23 color and @xmath26 in the range @xmath33 for all stars in sdss dr7 with segue spectroscopy at s / n @xmath34 and a sspp [ fe / h ] @xmath35 .",
    "we find that @xmath36 with about 500 k of scatter at constant @xmath23 color .",
    "we use @xmath23 color because the photometric accuracy of the sdss does not vary over the apparent magnitude range of our mpmsto sample , while the spectral s / n and therefore @xmath26 precision inferred from the spectra varies substantially . moreover , there are no reliable @xmath26 estimates for the half our mpmsto sample with s / n @xmath37 . for those reasons ,",
    "we use the simple relationship between @xmath23 color and @xmath26 at high s / n to ensure that we reliably include in each coadd spectrum only mpmsto star spectra in a narrow range of @xmath26 even at low s / n .",
    "likewise , the photometric selection and spectroscopic confirmation of mpmsto stars indicates that the stars in our sample have similar surface gravities . as a result",
    ", we ensure that each spectrum that enters into a coadd correspond to a star in a narrow range of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the only unconstrained stellar parameter is metallicity , and a sspp analysis of the coadded mpmsto spectrum will produce an unbiased estimate of the mean metallicity of the mpmsto population .",
    "we shift each mpmsto spectrum eligible for inclusion in a coadd to a heliocentric radial velocity @xmath38 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we then use natural cubic spline interpolation to interpolate both the spectrum and its inverse variance on to a common grid in wavelength .",
    "next , we numerically integrate the area under the curve defined by the spectrum and normalize both the spectrum ( by dividing by the normalization factor ) and the inverse variance ( by multiplying by the normalization factor squared ) to ensure that each spectrum that is to be included in the coadd has the same scale . for each population of interest , we then create an ensemble of realizations of the coadded spectrum by bootstrap resampling from the set of radial velocity zeroed , interpolated , and normalized spectra that belong to that population .",
    "each spectrum contributes to each wavelength bin in proportion to its inverse variance in that bin relative to the other spectra selected for coaddition .",
    "one danger to this approach is the possibility that the resultant coadded spectrum does not correspond to the spectrum of any physical star .",
    "this is unlikely in our analysis though , as we obtain good agreement between globular cluster metallicities produced by coaddition and their known metallicities from high resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we describe the coaddition process in detail in appendix a.    the sspp also uses sloan @xmath21 photometry in its parameter estimation routines , so we determine an equivalent @xmath21 photometric measurement for our coadd spectra by computing a weighted average of the @xmath21 photometric measurement of the individual stars in each bootstrap coadd , using the mean s / n between 3950   and 6000   as the weight .",
    "we then run the sspp on each of the bootstrap coadded spectra and average @xmath21 photometry to determine the mean of the sspp [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] estimates for that particular mpmsto population .      to determine the precision and accuracy of our coaddition algorithm as a function of s / n and population metallicity , we analyzed spectra created by coadding individual mpmsto star spectra that had been observed to very high s / n during the segue survey but that had been subsequently degraded with a detailed noise model .",
    "though this is the ideal case of uniform effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity , the result will reveal the amount of bias and variance in our measurements that can be attributed to noise and population metallicity .",
    "section 6 of @xcite describes the algorithm used to create the noise degraded spectra we use in this analysis and summarize here .",
    "each segue plate obtains spectra for stars that span a range of magnitudes from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , but is exposed to a fiducial s / n for the faint targets . as such , the noise properties of the segue spectra vary with the magnitude and color of the targets , with increasing fractional contribution from the sky for faint targets . because the observing criteria for the survey were homogeneous , it is possible to parametrize those variations and create a realistic model noise spectrum that can be used to create low s",
    "/ n realizations of high s / n spectra .",
    "randomly chosen residual spectra from the sky fibers are then added to complete each realization . this noise model was used in @xcite to test the accuracy of the sspp , and we use the same model here to test the accuracy of the sspp parameters of our coadds .",
    "we use a sample of 640 noise - added realizations of eight high s / n segue mpmsto stars with [ fe / h ] values from @xmath41 [ fe / h ] @xmath42 , which spans the metallicity range of our sample .",
    "we have 54 realizations at s / n values from 7.5 to 55 .",
    "we use this large sample of noise - degraded spectra for eight mpmsto stars to determine the precision and accuracy of our coaddition algorithm as a function of metallicity and s / n .",
    "the analysis of noise - added spectra allows us to examine the performance of the sspp and our coaddition algorithm over a range of metallicity and s / n that spans our entire sample .",
    "we plot the results of our analyses for [ fe / h ] in figure  [ fig01 ] and for [ @xmath0/fe ] in figure  [ fig02 ] .",
    "the mse of our sspp analysis of coadded spectra created from the coaddition of noise - degraded spectra of single mpmsto stars ranges from 0.05 dex in both [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] for the most iron - rich stars to 0.20 dex in both [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] for the most iron - poor stars . in both cases ,",
    "the range in effective s / n results because the coadded spectra are created by coadding from an ensemble of spectra with different s / n , and the range of s / n apparent in figure  [ fig01 ] and figure  [ fig02 ] is larger than the equivalent range of s / n in the echos . reassuringly , there is no obvious trend in the precision and accuracy of the bootstrap coaddition process with effective temperature .",
    "the outliers at low s / n in figure  [ fig01 ] and figure  [ fig02 ] are likely coadded spectra that include very low s / n spectra with large sky residuals , possibly taken from segue plates with below - average sky subtraction .",
    "the existence of outliers due to this effect is another reason why the bootstrap resampling from many spectra is important to determine the error distribution that results from the coaddition process . in the next subsection",
    ", we will use this analysis of the noise - added data to determine the mse of our coadditon analysis as function of metallicity and s / n .      in reality , the spectra in each echos coadd correspond to stars in a small but finite range of effective temperature , surface gravity , and composition . in order to determine the degree to which these spreads in properties affects our ability measure the mean metallicity of the echos and smooth halo populations by coadding spectra belonging to each , we analyzed spectra created by coadding individual mpmsto spectra corresponding to mpmsto stars that likely belong to the well studied galactic globular clusters m  13 and m  15 .",
    "the m  13 and m  15 data are representative of the range in @xmath26 and @xmath27 of a real mpmsto population as selected by the segue survey .",
    "it is exactly the fact that the globular cluster mpmsto stars occupy a narrow range in [ fe / h ] that makes the this globular cluster data so useful  we know the expected [ fe / h ] very well and can test whether or not we converge to the known value when coadding from a range of @xmath26 and @xmath27 . unfortunately , [ fe / h ] and @xmath26 are degenerate , so we optimize the @xmath23 range selected in order to produce coadded spectra with the maximum s / n and therefore the most accurate abundance estimate from the sspp in the following way . increasing the @xmath26 range of spectra that are coadded increases the number of spectra included in each coadd , increases the total signal in each coadd , and ultimately increases the precision of the abundance estimate .",
    "the trade off is that coadding spectra in too large a range in @xmath26 can decrease the accuracy of the abundance estimate .",
    "we find that coadding spectra that belong to stars in 250 k bins produces the same accuracy as the coaddition of stars in 500 k bins , as the scatter in the @xmath26@xmath23 relation at constant @xmath23 color is about 500 k. combined with the fact the coadd spectrum that results from coadding spectra in the 500 k bin always reaches higher s / n ( and therefore higher precision ) than the coadd spectrum that results from coadding spectra in the 250 k bin , we exclusively use the 500 k bin in our analysis of echos .",
    "we select those stars that have equatorial coordinates that place them within the tidal radius of each cluster ( as reported in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that have radial velocities consistent with cluster membership .",
    "given the precision of segue radial velocities at the s / n of the cluster spectra for cluster members that meet the segue turnoff sample criteria , that corresponds to 15 km s@xmath2 for m  13 and 25 km s@xmath2 for m  15 .",
    "we select for coaddition only those spectra that correspond to mpmsto stars with @xmath23 colors that place them within the 500 k bin in effective temperature that produces the highest s / n coadd .",
    "the median s / n of the mpmsto spectra that remain after applying these cuts is 22.9 from 12 spectra for m  13 and 9.0 from 11 spectra for m  15 .",
    "the number of spectra in each globular cluster coadd is approximately equivalent to the number of spectra included in each echos coadd .    from the @xmath7 mpmsto spectra that remain after",
    "the application of our cuts in equatorial coordinate , radial velocity , and @xmath23 color , we select with replacement @xmath43 spectra from the available data .",
    "we coadd the spectra and use the sspp to derive [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] for that bootstrap coadded spectrum , and save the result .",
    "we repeat that process 100 times for each of @xmath43 to build up the distribution of sspp [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] estimates for both globular clusters as a function of s / n .",
    "for m  13 , the sspp produces an estimate of [ fe / h ] @xmath44 and [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath45 .",
    "high - resolution measurements of m  13 by @xcite and @xcite yielded [ fe / h ] @xmath46 with [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath47 and [ fe / h ] @xmath48 with [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath49 respectively .",
    "likewise , for m  15 we find that [ fe / h ] @xmath50 and [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath51 . high - resolution measurements of m  15 by @xcite and @xcite yielded [ fe / h ] @xmath52 with [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath53 and [ fe / h ] @xmath54 with [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath55 respectively .",
    "we present the results for m  13 in figure  [ fig03 ] and the results for m  15 in figure  [ fig04 ] .",
    "this implies that at the resolution of the segue spectra and for the range of @xmath26 and @xmath27 included in the coadds , s / n is the dominant contribution to the mse in estimating the average metallicity of a population using the ensemble of bootstrap coadds . at the same time , these results compare favorably to those presented in @xcite and @xcite , as we measure the performance of the sspp on a subset of the segue data in a narrow range in @xmath23 color .",
    "we summarize the precision and accuracy of our sspp analysis of coadded spectra in figure  [ fig05 ] .",
    "the precision and accuracy of our sspp analysis is a function of metallicity ; consequently , our estimates are most precise and accurate ( @xmath56 dex in [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] ) for the most metal - rich populations , and least precise and accurate for the most metal - poor populations ( @xmath57 dex in [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] ) .",
    "moreover , we find that at equivalent metallicity , the mse we compute for m  13 and m  15 based on coadd spectra created by coadding mpmsto spectra in a finite range of effective temperature and surface gravity are in good agreement with the mse computed in the ideal case of constant effective temperature and surface gravity for coadds based on noise - degraded mpmsto spectra . as a result",
    ", we use the precision we derived for the sspp metallicity analysis of the noise - added spectra to characterize the precision of our echos metallicity measurements .",
    "for that reason , including both statistical and systematic effects , our sspp analysis of coadded segue mpmsto spectra produces estimates that are sufficiently precise and accurate to identify chemical differences between echos and the kinematically smooth inner halo mpmsto population on the order @xmath58 dex in both [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "we use the expected mse as a function of metallicity and s / n given in figure  [ fig05 ] to determine whether an echos is chemically distinct from the kinematically smooth halo mpmsto population along the same line of sight .      for each of the three classes of echos from , we consider for coaddition those spectra that correspond to stars within a radial velocity overdensity and therefore consistent with echos membership .",
    "as defined in , a radial velocity overdensity is a group of mpmsto stars observed with radial velocities within a narrow range such that the group is extraordinarily unlikely to be observed if the underlying population were kinematically smooth . for the bin detections , we coadd the spectra of stars in the 20 km s@xmath2 bin that contains the significant detection . for the peak detections , we coadd the spectra of stars within the measured width of the peak in the cumulative distribution function ( the @xmath59 statistic of ) .",
    "the width of the peak in @xmath59 is the same as the velocity dispersion quoted for each echos in tables  [ tbl-2 ] and  [ tbl-3 ] .    as before , we select those stars within the 500 k wide bin in effective temperature that produces the highest s / n in the resultant coadded spectrum .",
    "we shift each candidate spectrum to @xmath38 km s@xmath2 and interpolate the spectrum and its inverse variance on to a common wavelength grid , and rescale each spectrum and its inverse variance to a common scale . from the @xmath7 radial velocity selected ,",
    "temperature controlled , radial velocity zeroed , interpolated , and scaled mpmsto spectra , we sample @xmath7 with replacement and coadd the spectra to create a single bootstrap realization of the resultant coadded spectrum distribution . for each echos , we repeat the resampling process 100 times to create 100 bootstrap coadded spectra .",
    "we then run the sspp on all of the bootstrap coadded spectra to determine the distribution of measured [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] for the ensemble of realizations .    as a control , along the same line of sight as each echos",
    "we perform the same steps on all the mpmsto spectra that are associated with the kinematically smooth halo population . as a result ,",
    "the stars in the control sample are in the same volume , were observed at the same time , and have a similar range of magnitude and s / n as the stars in the echos . in that way , we can characterize the mean of [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] and estimate the error in our estimate of the mean for both the echos and the kinematically smooth population along the same line of sight . with that information ,",
    "any observed difference in composition is unlikely to result from systematic effects .",
    "consequently , any observed chemical offset between an echos and the kinematically smooth inner halo mpmsto population along the same line of sight likely results from genuine chemical differences .",
    "we report the results of these calculations for all of the echos discovered in in figure  [ fig06 ] through figure  [ fig11 ] and in tabular form in table  [ tbl-1 ] through table  [ tbl-3 ] . in figure  [ fig06 ] through figure  [ fig11 ] ,",
    "the precision of our sspp analysis is best characterized by the scatter apparent in results of the bootstrap coaddition process for both echos and the kinematically smooth halo .",
    "if the two clouds of points do not overlap , than the two populations are chemically distinct . we quantify this scatter and report the result in table  [ tbl-1 ] through table  [ tbl-3 ] . in all cases where the quoted metallicity of the smooth component is more iron - rich than typically associated with the smooth inner halo ,",
    "the reason is because the echos dominates the mpmsto population along that line of sight ( see figures 2 through 11 of ) . as a result",
    ", it is difficult to identify a large enough sample of stars in the kinematically smooth inner halo mpmsto population for the equivalent analysis , so the quoted metallicity of the smooth halo can be significantly influenced by the metallicity of the echos .",
    "we searched for correlations between the dynamical properties of echos from and the chemical properties determined in this analysis . for the rest of this section , we examine the properties of the 21 class ii peak echos from table 3 of . that sample of 21 echos is both the largest sample and the most representative sample of the inner halo echos population . in general , we find that echos that are iron - rich also have large radial velocity dispersions and are the most prominent echos in that they have high number densities and are fractionally the largest contributors to the mpmsto population along the line of sight where they were discovered ; we plot these relations in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "though large velocity dispersions are found only for the most metal - rich echos , small velocity dispersions are found at all metallicities .",
    "the prominence of metal - rich substructures was predicted by @xcite , as metal - rich substructures are preferentially produced by the most luminous progenitors .",
    "we find no significant correlation between [ fe / h ] or [ @xmath0/fe ] and distance .",
    "we initially identified echos because they are kinematically distinct from the kinematically smooth inner halo mpmsto population .",
    "as we showed in figure  [ fig06 ] through figure  [ fig11 ] , nearly all echos are also chemically distinct from the background smooth inner halo mpmsto population along the same line of sight .",
    "we summarize this chemical distinctiveness in figure  [ fig13 ] . as a population ,",
    "echos are more iron - rich but less @xmath0-enhanced than the kinematically smooth background inner halo mpmsto population .",
    "we showed in that 10% of the inner halo",
    "( by volume ) has 30% of its mpmsto population in echos .",
    "combined with the observation that echos are metal - rich , these facts suggest that the most likely metallicity for an accreted star in the inner halo is [ fe / h ] @xmath60 . at echos [ fe / h ] @xmath61 , the apparent correlation between the iron metallicity of echos and the iron metallicity of the smooth component of the halo results from the fact that iron - rich echos are also the most prominent echos ( see figure  [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "that is , since the iron - rich echos make up such a large fraction of the halo mpmsto population along the line of sight where they were discovered , it is difficult to isolate a sample of mpmsto stars in the kinematically smooth halo population .    to asses the statistical significance of the observation that the population of echos is more iron - rich but less @xmath0-enhanced than the kinematically smooth background inner halo mpmsto population",
    ", we used a monte carlo simulation .",
    "imagine that echos and the kinematically smooth component of the halo really did have the same chemical composition . in that case , in figure  [ fig13 ] the departure of the points from the line @xmath62 must result from imperfect observation , characterized by the error bars in the plot . under that null hypothesis",
    ", we sample each echos composition from a normal distribution centered on the line @xmath62 with standard deviation equal to the error in our measurement of the composition of the echos .",
    "likewise , we sample the composition of the smooth component along each line of sight from a normal distribution centered on the same point on the line @xmath62 with standard deviation equal to the error in our measurement of the composition of the smooth component .",
    "we compute the signed , cumulative euclidean distance of the entire population from the line @xmath62 , and save the result .",
    "we repeat this process 10@xmath63 times .",
    "we find that under the null hypothesis , in no instance does the monte carlo simulation produce a cumulative distance of each point from the line @xmath62 equal to the cumulative distance observed in the echos [ fe / h ] distribution .",
    "therefore the probability that the population of echos has the same [ fe / h ] as the smooth population along each line of sight in which we discovered an echos is less than 10@xmath64 .",
    "our [ @xmath0/fe ] estimates are much less precise than our [ fe / h ] estimates ; nevertheless , the probability that the population of echos has the same [ @xmath0/fe ] as the smooth population along each line of sight in which we discovered an echos is about 10@xmath65 .",
    "the fact that echos , as a population , are so chemically distinct from the smooth background inner halo mpmsto population along the same line of sight strongly supports the kinematic substructure identifications in .",
    "the stars in echos preferentially have apparent magnitudes that place them in the most distant half of our mpmsto sample @xcite . as a result , it is possible that the chemical distinctiveness of echos is the result of a metallicity gradient in the inner halo . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we considered only those lines of sight that were not targeted at a known element of substructure and for which we had no significant echos detection of any kind .",
    "in other words , those lines of sight which are dominated by the smooth component of the halo . for every mpmsto star in that sample , we very roughly estimate the distance to each star according to the procedure described in section 2 of .",
    "we then split the sample in half at about 14 kpc : the nearest 50% of the mpmsto population goes into the ",
    "close \" subsample and the farthest 50% of the mpmsto population goes into the  far \" subsample .",
    "then , for each subsample , we compute line of sight average metallicities by the same spectral coaddition process described in section 3 . in that way",
    ", we end up with two estimates for the average chemical composition of mpmsto stars in the smooth component along each line of sight where there is no significant substructure  an estimate for the  close \" subsample and estimate for the  far \" subsample .",
    "we find that the average metallicity for the  close \" subsample is [ fe / h ] @xmath66 while the average metallicity for the  far \" subsample is [ fe / h ] = @xmath67 .",
    "meanwhile , the average metallicity of our echos is [ fe / h ] = @xmath68 . for that reason ,",
    "the apparent chemical distinctiveness of echos is unlikely to be the result of a metallicity gradient in the inner halo . indeed , though the halo is potentially chemically inhomogeneous on large scales ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our analysis is confined to a relatively small region in the inner halo .",
    "echos are also chemically distinct from the other components of the milky way .",
    "the average level of star formation appears to have been more or less continuous in the thin disk for many gyr @xcite , so thermonuclear sn have had plenty of time to contribute to the chemistry of the ism .",

    "in figure  [ fig14 ] we plot our echos in the [ fe / h][@xmath0/fe ] plane along with [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath0/fe ] estimates for individual stars from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and presented in @xcite .",

    "[ fig15 ] , we plot the location of echos in the [ fe / h][@xmath0/fe ] plane along with the location of individual giant stars in eight dsph galaxies reported in @xcite .",

    "interestingly , there may be a hint in the @xcite compilation that those stars that are on retrograde orbits are the halo stars with [ @xmath0/fe ] most like the stars in the echos ( though the echos have higher iron metallicity ) .",
    "several studies using nearby halo star samples have found correlations between increased scatter or peculiar elemental abundance patterns and extreme kinematics @xcite .",
    "these studies find that metal - poor stars belonging to the distant , outer halo originated in a more varied and/or inhomogeneous environment , in support of the idea that the outer halo is assembled by more recent accretion of many low - mass systems .",
    "however , those studies are limited to [ fe / h ] @xmath72 , and our results demonstrate that for stars currently in the inner halo region of the galaxy , most stars accreted in the last 5 gyr are not metal - poor , but instead have [ fe / h ] @xmath60 .",
    "any comprehensive study of the halo accretion history must include stars over a broad range in metallicity .",
    "a direct comparison between our results and the metal - poor samples would require an analysis of selection biases in those samples that is beyond the scope of this paper ( for a discussion of the issues see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we note that the sample of halo stars in which the echos were identified was selected using ultraviolet excess , which would tend to bias our sample against metal - rich stars ( see for details ) .    in figure  [ fig16 ]",
    "we compare the velocity dispersions of echos from with the median radial velocity precision of the mpmsto stars in each echos . in this case , the radial velocity precision as a function of s / n we used in assumed a population metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath13 .",
    "segue radial velocity precision becomes better at higher metallicities , so the fact that echos have [ fe / h ] @xmath5 may indicate the actual radial velocity precision is somewhat better . in any case",

    "* ) implies the accretion of a progenitor with stellar mass @xmath77 and total mass @xmath78 , comparable to local group members ngc 147 or ngc 185 .",
    "radial velocity substructures persist for many crossing times , and because the typical crossing time in the inner halo is 50 myr echos should be observable for up to 5 gyr ( see section 5.1 of ) . as a result ,",

    "collisionless dynamics implies that as the position space component of the phase - space distribution of a tidally disrupted stellar system becomes hotter , the velocity component of its phase - space distribution must necessarily become colder ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the radial velocity dispersion of an element of cold halo substructure is a lower limit on the radial velocity dispersion of its progenitor . at the same time",

    "we argue that this is unlikely , however , as that would imply that the radial velocity dispersion within a single echos is a function of apparent magnitude , a trend not observed in echos ( see figures 2 through 11 in ) . with those caveats in mind , typical classical dwarf spheroidal ( dsph )",
    "galaxies have radial velocity dispersions @xmath82 km s@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one last possibility is that the stars in echos formed in the nascent disk of the milky way and were scattered into the inner halo during an accretion event .",
    "recent cosmological models of milky way formation by @xcite suggest that scattering into the inner halo does contribute to the stellar population in the inner halo .",
    "moreover , the accretion of dsph galaxies more massive then those suggested by the characteristic echos [ fe / h ] @xmath5 can scatter substantial numbers of disk stars into the inner halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "improved resolution and better treatments of star formation and feedback in theoretical models may yet determine whether scattering of disk stars into the inner halo by low - mass accretion events is a plausible origin of echos .",
    "the metal - poor main sequence turnoff stars in the elements of cold halo substructure in the inner halo of the milky way found to be kinematically distinct from the kinematically smooth inner halo population by @xcite are also chemically distinct from the smooth inner halo . as a population ,",

    "if echos are the result of the tidal disruption of an accreted dwarf spheroidal galaxy or galaxies , the high iron metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath5 , large velocity dispersion @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , and the lack of corresponding surface brightness substructure imply the accretion of a @xmath88 halo sometime in the last 5 gyr since @xmath89 .",

    "<S> we determine the average metallicities of the elements of cold halo substructure ( echos ) that we previously identified in the inner halo of the milky way within 17.5 kpc of the sun . as a population , we find that stars kinematically associated with echos are chemically distinct from the background kinematically smooth inner halo stellar population along the same sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> echos are systematically more iron - rich , but less @xmath0-enhanced than the kinematically - smooth component of the inner halo . </S>",
    "<S> echos are also chemically distinct from other milky way components : more iron - poor than typical thick - disk stars and both more iron - poor and @xmath0-enhanced than typical thin - disk stars . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , the radial velocity dispersion distribution of echos extends beyond @xmath1 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> globular clusters are unlikely echos progenitors , as echos have large velocity dispersions and are found in a region of the galaxy in which iron - rich globular clusters are very rare . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the chemical composition of stars in echos do not match predictions for stars formed in the milky way and subsequently scattered into the inner halo . </S>",
    "<S> dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are possible echos progenitors , and if echos are formed through the tidal disruption of one or more dsph galaxies , the typical echos [ fe / h ] @xmath3 and radial velocity dispersion @xmath1 km s@xmath2 implies a dsph with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our observations confirm the predictions of theoretical models of milky way halo formation that suggest that prominent substructures are likely to be metal - rich , and our result implies that the most likely metallicity for a recently accreted star currently in the inner halo is [ fe / h ] @xmath5 . </S>"
