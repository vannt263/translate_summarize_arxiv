    "the superkamiokande collaboration s zenith angle analysis of its data @xcite , may sway even a skeptic to the view that neutrino oscillations have been observed .",
    "the precise form of the neutrino mass matrix and the number of neutrino species remain undetermined , however .",
    "the confusing and complicated nature of the whole collection of neutrino data in laboratory and astrophysical settings makes for an exciting playing field for workers trying to establish a `` standard model '' of neutrino physics .",
    "vigorous efforts have been made to determine whether one needs only three flavors of neutrinos , mixed either two - by - two @xcite or with some form of full three- state mixing@xcite,@xcite or whether a fourth , sterile neutrino is needed in the mixture @xcite,@xcite . there is not yet a compelling phenomenological or theoretical case for any of these reasonable , and partially successful , approaches .",
    "direct violation in neutrino interactions is a feature of the flavor - mixing puzzle that has received relatively little attention .",
    "most models that predict the existence of neutrino mass and mixing , and consequently neutrino oscillations , also contain direct neutrino flavor- violating interactions .",
    "in fact , some interesting models have no neutrino masses at tree level , but flavor - violating interactions generate them in loop graphs@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover , with the help of resonant enhancement , massless neutrinos can mix in a non - trivial way in certain models and produce flavor transitions in flight@xcite .",
    "it seems natural to extend the phenomenological framework for oscillations of propagating neutrinos to include the effects of direct interactions in a way that allows one to survey all effects at once . a formalism to carry out this program",
    "is sketched and illustrated in@xcite , and we extend the range of applications and uncover several new features in the present paper .",
    "specific models are not discussed here , since we emphasize the model independent features of the oscillation - plus - direct flavor violation analysis .",
    "bounds on parameter combinations from a given model can be directly obtained from the coefficients of our effective four fermi lagrangian .    as in @xcite ,",
    "our primary concern is with the accelerator experiments @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the experimental constraints on muonium - antimuonium conversion are now so tight @xcite that a purely direct interaction explanation of the muon decay - at - rest ( dar ) signal reported in @xcite can be rather convincingly ruled out@xcite . here",
    "we emphasize effects that are significant when combined with the oscillation phenomenon .",
    "for example , we show in section iv that direct effects can kill oscillations in special circumstances .",
    "we also find that in high sensitivity experiments , where tight limits in regions of @xmath3-@xmath4 space are achieved , small , direct flavor violation can change a boundary by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we illustrate this by showing examples of the effects on the large @xmath4 , small @xmath3 boundary of the @xmath5 mixing set by the nomad collaboration@xcite . in another sensitive comparison ,",
    "we show the power of comparing the `` wrong flavor '' appearance signals from the clean @xmath0 and @xmath1 beams afforded by a @xmath2 collider .",
    "there are several studies where direct flavor violation is considered in the solar and atmospheric cases . in @xcite the combined oscillation and direct effects are applied to an analysis of the resonant conversion of electron neutrinos to other species as the explanation of the solar neutrino deficit@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , while in @xcite and @xcite , an explanation using resonantly enhanced direct lepton number violation of the zenith angle effect reported in @xcite was presented . in both cases significant effects",
    "were reported , though a complete explanation in terms of direct interactions is probably not possible in the solar case .",
    "the situation is not settled in the atmospheric case .",
    "a critique of alternatives to the large @xmath0- @xmath1 mixing solutions to the atmospheric neutrino data such as those presented in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite is given in @xcite .",
    "a model using @xmath0 decay that answers the objection in @xcite is described in @xcite .",
    "we encourage the reader interested in the impact of small , direct flavor violation on the analysis of experiments with high sensitivity to `` wrong flavor '' appearance to go straight to sec .",
    "the background is given in the next two sections .",
    "in the following section , the parameterization and notation are defined , and the notion of a generalized transition probability factor is explained . in sec .",
    "3 the experimental constraints on flavor violating parameters defined in sec . 2 are summarized . as just remarked , the formalism is applied to a number of examples drawn from current or future accelerator experiments in sec .",
    "we keep the constraints on flavor - violating parameters clearly in mind in the discussion of these applications .",
    "the formalism and results of its applications are summarized and several conclusions are drawn in secs . 5 and 6 . the general forms of the probability factors that apply to the case where @xmath6 decay provides the source of neutrinos are given in the appendix .",
    "in this section we develop a compact parameterization of direct interaction effects in neutrino flavor - changing processes . we represent the low - energy effective interactions involving neutrinos , charged leptons and first generation quarks by the four - fermi semileptonic ( s ) and leptonic ( l ) lagrangians play no direct role in our discussion , so they are suppressed in the notation . ]",

    "repeated indices are summed .",
    "the coefficients k and f , whose indices are i , j , k , ... , represent the coupling strengths for the different lepton flavor combinations , while the indices a , b , ... label the mass eigenvalues . the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath11 allow for different strengths for l and r couplings to the quark currents .",
    "the lorentz structure of the bilinear forms is labeled by a = s , v or t and @xmath12 denotes the left- and right - helicity projections .",
    "the expression in eq.(2 ) is a generalization of the generic muon - decay , four- fermi interaction to include lepton flavor violations of all types . by a fierz transformation",
    "one can show that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are both identically zero . restricting application of eq.(2 ) to muon decay and ( unobserved ) massless neutrinos , one can show that it is not possible to test lepton number conservation from the available observables @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the notation by applying it to the standard model ( sm ) effective , low - energy lagrangian .",
    "the leptonic neutral - current term ,    @xmath15 ( \\overline{\\nu_{j}}\\gamma^{\\mu}p_{l}\\nu_{j}),\\ ] ]    can be fierz transformed into an equivalent charged current form    @xmath16(\\overline{\\nu_{j}}\\gamma^{\\mu } p_{l}l_{i})-2[\\overline{l_{i}}2s_{w}^2p_{l}\\nu_{j}](\\overline{\\nu_{j}}p_{r } l_{i})].\\ ] ]    next we add the sm leptonic charged - current effective lagrangian    @xmath17(\\overline{\\nu_{j}}\\gamma^{\\mu } p_{l}\\l_{j})},\\ ] ]    and the semileptonic effective lagrangian    @xmath18(\\overline{l_{j}}\\gamma^{\\mu } p_{l}\\nu_{j})}+h.c.\\ ] ]    the f and k coefficients can now be read off from the sm effective low energy lagrangian :    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as fig .",
    "8 shows , the value of the ratio changes rapidly as a function of @xmath19 , and offers a possible method to directly constrain @xmath19 down to 0.01 or less by comparing the @xmath20 oscillation signal to its inverse",
    ". we can put this another way by comparing estimates of the number of @xmath21 events with the number of @xmath22 events detected downstream from @xmath23 s decaying in flight . in a purely oscillation picture , the @xmath21 result from @xmath0 oscillating to @xmath1 , while the @xmath22 result from @xmath24 oscillating to @xmath25 . in fig .",
    "9 we show a plot of the number of events expected vs. @xmath19 for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 values assumed , given the sm event rates estimated in the search experiment proposed in@xcite .    figure 9 .",
    "makes evident that interference between the oscillation and direct amplitudes greatly enhances the @xmath22 appearance rate estimate as @xmath19 grows , while there is little effect ( a factor @xmath26 ) on the @xmath21 rate .",
    "the numbers for @xmath19=0 correspond to the pure oscillation numbers given in@xcite , but decreased by the factor @xmath3= 0.003 for @xmath4=1@xmath27 , since the numbers there refer to @xmath3=1 .",
    "we see again that looking for new physics may be quite fruitful in the comparisons of appearance signals in `` pure '' neutrino beams provided by muon colliders",
    ". the current @xmath28 limit on @xmath29 can be extracted from the limit @xcite @xmath30@xmath31 , or @xmath32 0.22 . as figs . 8 and 9",
    "indicate , finding @xmath33 is sufficient to improve the bound roughly to @xmath34 , an order of magnitude better than the bound inferred from @xcite . allowing @xmath35= 0.025 has little effect on this statement .",
    "referring next to eq.(28 ) , let us consider what a proposed reach to @xmath36 at @xmath37 c.l.@xcite affects the impact of direct interactions on the @xmath4 vs. @xmath3 contour .",
    "specifically , how do @xmath38 and @xmath39 sources affect @xmath1 appearance from @xmath23 sources ( or @xmath24 appearance from @xmath22 sources ) . from ( 28 ) one can show that @xmath40 , which essentially means that @xmath41 for small @xmath42 .",
    "in particular for @xmath43 and @xmath44 = @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "this range is slightly less than the model - independent estimate , albeit on the generous side , of the bound @xmath47 that follows from the experimental limit on muonium - antimuonium transition@xcite .",
    "we show the @xmath48 contour in fig . 10 with several sets of values of @xmath29 and @xmath49 .",
    "the lack of sensitivity to @xmath29 with @xmath50 , already evident from eq.(28 ) and fig .",
    "9 is indicated in fig .",
    "10 by the pile - up of curves with @xmath51 .",
    "the situation changes drastically when @xmath52 , near its upper bound for solutions for @xmath53 to exist for some @xmath54 range of values .",
    "as noted in the introduction , possible direct interaction contributions are too small to affect the lsnd oscillation signal fits .",
    "if lsnd results are not confirmed and the limits drop to the level of @xmath55 , then the interpretation of those bounds should include the possible range of direct interaction strengths allowed by limits from other experiments .",
    "correlated limits on @xmath4 , @xmath3 and @xmath56 can then be studied with the new data .",
    "direct lepton number violating interactions and neutrino mass terms often go hand - in - hand in physics beyond the standard model . with this in mind we developed a general parametrization of lepton number violating interactions that fits smoothly with the usual description of neutrino oscillations in terms of mixing angles .",
    "we defined generalized `` probability factors '' and illustrated with a number of examples drawn from accelerator appearance experimental set - ups .",
    "we concentrated on the case where the structure of the effective four - fermion , charged current , flavor - violating operators is v - a .",
    "this is the cleanest situation and lends itself to a parameterization in terms of angles that makes the role of new interactions in the `` wrong - flavor '' appearance probability factors rather transparent .",
    "for example , in eq.(23 ) the direct effects are expressed in terms of a leading term that gives all of the appearance probability when there is no oscillation , a second term that gives the interplay between the oscillation and direct effects and shows that there is a special condition @xmath57-@xmath19 = integer@xmath58 where the usual oscillation term can be zero even when there is a neutrino mass difference and a mixing between flavors .",
    "the role of the cp - violating phase in the flavor - violating coupling is isolated in the last term , which is zero when the phase is a multiple of @xmath59 , so the entire expression can be decomposed into readily interpretable pieces .    because the limits on lepton flavor violation are generally tight , the impact on the oscillation picture of appearance and disappearance is limited to cases where the oscillation probabilities are small and sensitive to the precise values of the mixing angles .",
    "we illustrate such situations in detail in sec . 4 , where the sensitive dependence of the appearance probability on the relative values of the flavor - violating angle @xmath19 and the mass - mixing angle @xmath57 are shown in figs . 1 , 2 and 7 for the amplitude of the oscillation behavior ,",
    "are shown in fig . 3 for the the nomad , @xmath60 ,",
    "two - flavor mixing boundaries and are shown in fig . 6 for the corresponding three - flavor mixing boundaries in the one - mass - difference dominance model .",
    "the nomad experiment examples are carefully done within the limits imposed on the size of the flavor violations , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "we present similar considerations for the case where the source is @xmath6-decay , and the boundaries appropriate to a proposed @xmath6 storage ring environment are shown in fig .",
    "10 , again for realistic constraints on the flavor - violation strength .",
    "4 illustrates another new effect that shows that care must be taken in interpreting limits set by wrong - flavor appearance searches .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath44=@xmath61 boundaries for source - only and source - plus - detector are quite different as viewed in the @xmath57-@xmath19 plane .",
    "the former boundary is `` tilted '' and so the bound on @xmath62 set by the @xmath37 c.l .",
    "boundary is correlated with the value of @xmath57 so that , contrary to the usual expectation , the bound on @xmath19 is not obtained by setting @xmath57=0 .",
    "the boundary for the latter situation , however , does conform to the usual expectation .",
    "we show how the comparison of electron appearance and muon appearance experiments in a clean @xmath6 storage ring environment could be used to increase the sensitivity to direct , neutrino flavor violations by an order of magnitude in the discussion of figs 8 and 9 .",
    "these show the rather strong sensitivity of the muon appearance effects on the value of the violation parameter @xmath29 .",
    "a theme that recurs throught the analysis in sec.4 is that small , direct flavor violation can seriously complicate the picture of wrong - flavor appearance in a number of experimentally realistic situations . in short , the interpretation of a signal can be quite ambiguous . to sort out the complete picture ,",
    "a number of measurements at various values of l / e in a variety of different channels is needed .",
    "perhaps the cleanest and most flexible environment for such studies is provided by a @xmath22 @xmath23 collider with an associated facility for neutrino beams .",
    "studies such as those exemplified in@xcite can put much more stringent tests on direct neutrino flavor violation than currently exist , while at the same time allowing detailed oscillation analysis .",
    "direct flavor - violation effects in semileptonic processes require pion and kaon beams of course , and the boone experiment will provide exploration of a wide range of parameter space , for example .",
    "though the direct flavor - violating strengths are constrained to be small , the matter - enhancement effects can lead to large transition probabilities , as analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , and for small probabilities the `` vacuum '' effects in accelerator experiments can lead to important modification of the oscillation description .",
    "we conclude that the crucial role neutrinos play in our understanding of particle and astrophysics requires that data be analyzed with the relevant flavor violation included to properly interpret current and future experiments .",
    "the present work provides a framework for that task and provides vivid , realistic examples of its application .",

    "we gather the general formulas for appearance probabilities that apply when muon decay is the source of neutrinos .",
    "the presence of two neutrinos in the final state , only one of which is detected by a choice of lepton - flavor sensitive detector , makes the analysis slightly different from the situation when meson decay provides the source of neutrinos .            in all of the expressions ,",
    "the repeated indices within the absolute - square are understood to be summed . by choosing a given process , keeping the dominant flavor - transition terms and parameterizing the f amplitudes by angles , the @xmath6 decay source expressions in the text",
