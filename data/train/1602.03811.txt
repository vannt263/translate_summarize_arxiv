    "ever since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with ultracold alkali atomic vapors @xcite , attempts have been made to examine the role of various energy scales in the physics of quantum systems of interacting particles rotating in a trap @xcite . the decisive control over parameters such as density , effective dimensionality and the particle - particle interactions @xcite enables one to examine their effects on the quantum many - body states . with recent advances in bec on optical lattices",
    "@xcite and microchip traps @xcite , the few - body systems ( seem to be possible to reach ) have attracted particular attention of theorists @xcite .",
    "an understanding of the physics of few - body systems provide an insight into the beyond mean - field physics of macroscopic ensembles @xcite . for dilute gas systems at low - enough temperatures ,",
    "the interparticle interaction being short - ranged is usually described by zero - range ( @xmath11-function ) potential @xcite .",
    "this approach is useful in case of one dimensional system as the @xmath11-function interaction is well understood and easy to handle .",
    "unfortunately , such an interaction potential in 2d is not self - adjoint @xcite and can not be used in a manner analogous to its one dimensional counterpart . using configuration interaction , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a @xmath11-function is not suitable as a replacement for the two - body interaction in exact theories .",
    "indeed a regularized 2d contact potential is analytically tractable @xcite but harder to handle it numerically .",
    "further as the number of particles is increased beyond two , the complexity of the quantum states increases quickly and the analytical treatment becomes intractable , leaving one only with a numerical recourse .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in order to tackle the limit of zero - range interaction numerically @xcite , a prohibitively large hilbert space is required to obtain the many - body ground state of the system . for numerical many - body simulation ,",
    "one usually prefers a smooth , finite - range , model interaction potential .",
    "this leads us to use the finite - range gaussian potential as a model inter - particle interaction @xcite , in the trapped interacting few - boson system .",
    "more control over the inter - particle interaction with the variation of interaction range and being expandable within finite number of basis functions of the hilbert space , are few of the advantages of the gaussian potential over the usual @xmath11-function potential . besides , most of the mean field as well as the many - body calculations on harmonically confined interacting bose gas use only the lowest - landau - levels ( lll ) , in which bosons occupy single - particle states with radial quantum number @xmath12 and angular momentum quantum number @xmath13 taking positive sign .",
    "there are studies @xcite wherein it has been argued that for slow rotating  @xcite and moderately to strongly interacting  @xcite bosons , it becomes necessary to consider the single - particle states beyond lll approximation with @xmath14 , while @xmath13 is allowed to take positive as well as negative values in constructing the many - body basis states .",

    "the exact diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian matrix is carried out in given subspaces of quantized total angular momentum @xmath2 using davidson iterative algorithm @xcite to obtain the lowest - energy eigenstates of the system in the co - rotating frame .",
    "the whole study of the many - body ground state properties of the rotating bose - condensed gas is carried out beyond the usual lll approximation @xcite .",
    "we focus on quite small angular momentum regime @xmath16 and are mainly interested in exploring the vicinity of first central vortex ( @xmath7 ) state . to study the effect of the interaction potential range on the bose - condensed system , we used finite - range gaussian potential to avoid the mathematical difficulties of the contact ( @xmath11-function ) interaction in connection to the diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "we examine in detail the role of interaction potential range on the various quantities of interest which are experimentally accessible such as the ground state energy , degree of condensation , von neumann entanglement entropy and critical angular velocity @xmath6 of first vortex state @xmath7 .",
