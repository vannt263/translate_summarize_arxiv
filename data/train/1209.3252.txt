    "the situation has drastically changed with the discovery of the colored@xcite random tensor models .",

    "let @xmath11 be a covariant complex tensor of rank @xmath8 transforming under the external tensor product of @xmath8 fundamental representations of the unitary group @xmath12 , for some fixed dimensions @xmath13 . the tensor @xmath11 can be seen as a collection of @xmath14 complex numbers @xmath15 transforming as @xmath16 each unitary group @xmath17 acts independently on its corresponding index .",
    "in particular , as the dimensions @xmath18 might very well be different , @xmath11 has _ no symmetry properties _ under permutation of its indices .",

    "because the unitary group acts independently on each index , the contractions must preserve the color : the first index @xmath26 of a @xmath11 must always contract with the first index @xmath31 on some @xmath23 , the second index @xmath28 of @xmath11 with the second index @xmath32 on some @xmath23 and so on .",

    "one can visualize this pseudomanifold by gluing simplices .",

    "the @xmath62 colored graphs have lines of four colors @xmath60 , @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath73 .",
    "we associate a positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) oriented tetrahedron to every four valent white ( resp .",
    "black ) vertex .",
    "the triangles bounding the tetrahedron are dual to the lines emanating from the vertex ( see figure [ fig1.2](a ) ) and inherit their color . thus a tetrahedron is bounded by four triangles of colors @xmath60 , @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath73 . the coloring of the triangles induces colorings on all the elements of the tetrahedron : the edge of the tetrahedron common to the triangles @xmath27 and @xmath29 is colored by the couple of colors @xmath74 , and so on .",
    "similarly the apex of the tetrahedron common to the triangles @xmath27 , @xmath29 and @xmath73 is colored with the triple of colors @xmath75 .",
    "a line in the graph represents the _ unique _ gluing of two tetrahedra which respects _ all _ the colorings .",
    "thus ( see figure [ fig1.2](b ) ) we glue the triangle of color @xmath73 of one tetrahedron on the triangle of color @xmath73 of the other such that the edge @xmath76 ( @xmath77 resp .",
    "@xmath78 ) is glued on the edge @xmath76 ( @xmath77 resp .",
    "@xmath78 ) , and the apex @xmath75 ( @xmath79 resp .",
    "@xmath80 ) is glued on the apex @xmath75 ( @xmath79 resp .",
    "@xmath80 ) .",
    "the full cellular structure of the resulting gluing of tetrahedra is encoded in the colors .",
    "for instance an edge @xmath76 is represented by a subgraph with colors @xmath76 in the graph @xmath70 ( see figure [ fig1.2](c ) ) .",
    "we call the subgraphs with two colors of @xmath70 its _ faces_.          second , one can ask what is the topological interpretation of an initial trace invariants . as",
    "an invariant is a graph with @xmath73 colors ( see figure [ fig : polytope ] ) , it represents a surface . adding the lines of color @xmath60 comes to taking the topological cone over this surface ( and",
    "if the surface has non zero genus it leads to a conical singularity ) . the invariant represents a `` chunk '' of space , and the @xmath81 colored graph can be seem as the gluing of such chunks together .",
    "a chunk can alternatively be seen by associating tetrahedra to the vertices of the invariant ( decorated by external halflines of color @xmath60 ) and observing that the invariant represents the gluing of these tetrahedra along triangles of colors @xmath27 @xmath29 and @xmath73 , but not along the triangles of color @xmath60 . as in every tetrahedron the triangle of color zero is opposed to an unique vertex , this chunk is a gluing of tetrahedra ( along triangles ) around a vertex@xcite .",
    "we start by a technical prelude .",
    "the graphs of matrix models are ribbon graphs made of vertices lines and faces .",
    "consider a ( closed connected ) ribbon graph with an even number of trivalent vertices , @xmath82 , thus having @xmath83 lines .",
    "the number of faces of the graph can be expressed as a function of only the number of vertices and the _ genus _ @xmath84 of the graph @xmath85    a similar relation holds in higher dimensions for @xmath8 colored graphs . to every graph @xmath86 with @xmath8 colors we associate a _ non negative",
    "_ integer @xmath87 ( which we call its _ degree _ ) such that the number of faces ( subgraph with two colors ) of @xmath42 writes@xcite @xmath88 with @xmath89 is the half number of vertices of @xmath42 .",
    "naturally a similar relation holds for graphs with @xmath62 colors by shifting @xmath8 to @xmath62 .",
    "the crucial property of the degree is that , like the genus , it is non negative @xmath90 .",
    "it is an intrinsic integer number one can compute starting from the graph .",
    "however , contrary to the genus , the degree is _ not _ a topological invariant but it mixes information about the topology and cellular structure@xcite .",
    "the idea is that when counting faces one can identify ribbon graphs @xmath91 ( called jackets@xcite ) embedded in the colored graph .",
    "one can separately count the number of faces of each jacket in terms of its genus @xmath92 .",
    "summing over all jackets one gets a counting of the total number of faces of the colored graph in terms of the sum of these genera @xmath93 which is the degree of @xmath42 . some examples ( for graphs with @xmath81 colors )",
    "are presented in figure [ fig : degree ] .",
    "we now compute the amplitude of a graph .",
    "we fix the scaling of the invariants in the action eq . , @xmath87 , to be exactly there degree and evaluate eq .",
    "the non trivial part comes from counting the number of independent sums .",
    "recall that each solid line of colors @xmath94 represents the identification of one index , while the dashed lines of color @xmath60 represent the identifications of @xmath8 indices .",
    "it follows that an index , say @xmath26 , is identified once along a solid line of color @xmath27 , then along a dashed line @xmath60 , then along a solid line @xmath27 , the along a dashed line , and so on until the cycle of colors @xmath60 and @xmath27 closes .",
    "we thus get a free sum over an index , hence a factor @xmath7 , for every cycle ( i.e. face ) with colors @xmath95 .",
    "the total number of faces expresses in terms of the degree of @xmath70 and a short computation yields@xcite          all the results presented so far particularize when @xmath98 to the classical matrix models results .",
    "in particular @xmath99 colored graphs are ribbon graphs and the degree is the genus . at leading order only the @xmath62 colored graphs of degree",
    "zero contribute .",
    "the structure of the @xmath62 colored graphs of degree zero is very different for @xmath98 ( matrices ) and @xmath100 ( tensors ) .",
    "the @xmath62 dipole has @xmath29 vertices and @xmath101 faces ( one for each couple of colors",
    "@xmath102 ) hence degree @xmath60 ( figure [ fig : degree](a ) ) . for @xmath100",
    "all the graphs of degree zero with @xmath103 vertices can be obtained by inserting two vertices connected by @xmath8 lines arbitrarily on any line of a @xmath62 colored graph of degree zero with @xmath104 vertices@xcite .",
    "this of course does not hold for @xmath98 .",
    "we call these graphs _ melons _ ( see figure [ fig : melonsss ] ) .",
    "the graph with two vertices and @xmath62 lines represents the coherent identification of two @xmath8 simplices along their boundary , hence it represents a sphere in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "two vertices connected by @xmath8-lines represent a ball in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "the iterative insertion of balls into spheres preserves the topology , hence      as the melonic graphs are generated by an iterative insertion procedure , they can be mapped onto abstract ( colored , @xmath62-ary ) trees .",
    "the trees are a summable family , hence the melonic graphs are a summable family with a finite radius of convergence .",
    "the weight of a melonic graph depends on the coupling constants of the model and tunning to criticality tensor models undergo , like matrix models , a phase transition to continuous infinitely refined random spaces .",
