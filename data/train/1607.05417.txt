    "let @xmath5 be a simply connected bounded domain in @xmath6 with boundary @xmath7 , and let @xmath8 denote the outer normal to @xmath7 at the point @xmath9 .",
    "it is well known that the solution of various boundary value problems for the laplace equation can be reduced to solution of the integral equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 refer to the arc length differential and @xmath12 is a compact operator .",

    "this fact essentially simplifies the stability investigation of approximation methods for the equation .",
    "however , if @xmath7 possesses corner points , the situation becomes more involved .",
    "one of the simplest cases to treat is a polygonal boundary or a boundary with polygonally shaped corners and there are a number of works investigating approximation methods for the equation on such curves @xcite . for a comprehensive survey",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .    in the present work we consider spline galerkin methods for the double layer potential equation in the case of simple piecewise smooth curves .",
    "such methods are often used to determine approximate solutions of . however , for contours with corners , the stability analysis of the methods is not complete .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that for boundary integral equations the presence of corners on the boundary may lead to extra conditions required for the stability of the approximation method considered @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of spline galerkin methods .",
    "it turns out that stability depends on the invertibility of some operators associated with corner points of @xmath7 .",
    "these operators belong to an algebra of toeplitz operators and , at present , there is no tool to verify their invertibility . therefore , our second goal is to present an approach to check the invertibility of the operators mentioned .",
    "this approach is based on considering our approximation methods on special model curves , and it allows us to show that galerkin methods for double layer potential equations on piecewise smooth contours behave similarly to equations on smooth curves .",
    "thus , it was discovered that at least for the splines of degree @xmath2 and @xmath3 the corresponding galerkin method is always stable provided that all opening angles of the corner points are located in the interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "similar results concerning the spline galerkin methods for the sherman - lauricella equation have been recently obtained in @xcite .",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] is devoted to description of spline spaces and spline galerkin methods .",

    "however , here we would like to illustrate the efficiency of the method by a few examples .",
    "for simplicity , now we only consider equations with the operator @xmath62 .",
    "although special , this case is of the utmost importance .",
    "it occurs when reducing boundary value problems for partial differential equations to boundary integral equations .",
