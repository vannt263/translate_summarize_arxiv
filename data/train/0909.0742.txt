    "the prospects of detecting gravitational waves ( gws ) in the coming decade are looking ever more promising @xcite .",
    "there is currently a considerable experimental effort to detect gravitational waves in a wide range of frequencies . at high frequencies @xmath2 the ground based laser interferometric detectors , such as the currently operational ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite , especially in their  advanced \" configuration ,",
    "should be able to observe gws from a wide range of astrophysical sources .",
    "the planned space interferometer lisa @xcite would be able to observe gws in the region of frequencies @xmath3 . at intermediate range of frequencies",
    "@xmath4 pulsar timing measurements are a very strong tool for observing the gw signature .",
    "several pulsar timing array ( pta ) projects , such as ppta @xcite , epta @xcite and nanograv @xcite are collecting data and yielding an unprecedented and every increasing sensitivity in intermediate frequency range . furthermore , the implementation of the planned square kilometer array ( ska ) @xcite radio telescope would further improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing measurements to gravitational waves .",
    "finally , at the lowest frequencies @xmath5 considerable efforts are being made to measure the imprints of relic gravitational waves in the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we shall consider pulsar timing , in particular timing of millisecond pulsar ( msps ) , as a tool to study gravitational waves ( see @xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "a gw passing between the pulsar and the observer on earth will leave a modulating signature on the observed period of the pulsar .",
    "for this reason , the analysis of pulsar timing residuals gives a unique opportunity to observe gws @xcite .",
    "a particularly attractive method for detection is to cross - correlate the timing signal from different pulsars @xcite .",
    "this method led to the proposal for a pta @xcite , which is aimed at observing a number of pulsars distributed on the sky at regular time intervals over a long time span ( see @xcite for recent review ) .",
    "current pulsar timing observations are yet to detect gravitational waves . however , current upper bounds on the stochastic background of gws @xmath6 @xcite ( in terms of the ratio of energy density per unit logarithmic frequency interval to the cosmological critical density at frequency @xmath7 ) already place interesting limits on cosmic string models . moreover , in the near future , it is likely that the gw background of coalescing extragalactic supermassive black hole binaries and possibly the background of relic gravitational waves will be discovered @xcite .",
    "apart from the stochastic backgrounds , pulsar timing also has the potential to observe gws from individual sources . in particular , there has been considerable interest in gws emitted by massive black hole binaries systems @xcite .    in the present work we shall be interested with individual sources which emit gravitational waves of a particular class , namely gravitational wave bursts with memory ( bwm ) @xcite , and analyze the prospects for their detection in pulsar timing measurements . in general ,",
    "bwm are characterized by a rise in the gravitational wave field @xmath8 from zero , followed by oscillatory behaviour for a few cycles and settling down at a final non - zero value @xmath9 after a characteristic time @xmath10 known as the duration of the burst @xcite .",
    "the permanent change @xmath9 is usually referred to as the burst s  memory \" .",
    "bwms are produced in situations where there is a net change in the time derivatives of multipole moments characterizing the system , for example during flyby of massive bodies on hyperbolic trajectories or an asymmetric supernova explosion .",
    "a bwm where the net change of the moments is attributed to the gravitons released during the burst is known as the christodoulou effect @xcite .",
    "whatever the physical reason , the existence of the permanent offset @xmath9 in bwms makes them particularly interesting for pulsar timing studies .",
    "as we shall show below , the burst s memory leads to a characteristic signature in pulsar timing residuals which accumulates linearly with time .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sectionii ] with a simple order - of - magnitude estimation of the potential sources of bwm , and compare them with the expected sensitivity of pulsar timing measurements . in this section ,",
    "we study the typical amplitudes and possible event rates for potential signals .",
    "the simplistic analysis shows that , in the context of pulsar timing , the most observationally promising sources of bwm are extragalactic coalescing supermassive black holes binaries . in section  [ sectioniii ] , we study the observational prospects for the detection of the bwm signal in significant detail . using a simple analytical model for a bwm signal we calculate the pulsar timing residual . following this",
    ", we evaluate the expected signal - to - noise ratio , and the expected number of bwm events that could be observed in a typical pulsar timing experiment .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sectionv ] with an overview and discussion of the main results of this work .",
    "in an astrophysical context , bwm typically occur in burst events which are accompanied by considerable amount of mass or radiation ejected in an asymmetric fashion . a simple formula for estimating the characteristic amplitude of bwm @xcite reads : [ simpleformula ] h^mem~()^2 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the schwarzschild radius and velocity of aspherically ejected parts respectively , and @xmath13 is the distance to the source of the burst .",
    "the effect is maximal when the mass is ejected at maximal speed , i.e _ c _ , corresponding to ejection of photons or gravitons . in the evaluations below we",
    "shall work in units @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "an obvious source of gw bwm is a core - collapse supernova . in a typical scenario ,",
    "the value of asymmetrically radiated energy is @xmath15 ( inferred from the velocities of neutron stars , see e.g. @xcite ) , leading to an estimate @xmath16 , for the typical bwm strain for a core - collapse supernova at a distance of @xmath17 from the observer .",
    "in fact , these estimates are overoptimistic ( see @xcite ) . taking into account the expected event rate of core - collapse supernovae of a few per century in a milky way type galaxy",
    ", one can conclude that the sensitivity of pulsar timing measurements will not allow the detection of such a signal ( see section [ sectioniv ] for a discussion of the signal - to - noise ratio ) .    another interesting class of burst events",
    "are black hole ( bh ) mergers @xcite .",
    "depending on the angular momentum of the merging bhs , up to several percent of the total mass of the system can be radiated non - spherically during the burst @xcite .",
    "the masses of bhs range from stellar to several billion solar masses .",
    "however , from ( [ simpleformula ] ) , we conclude that the most interesting candidates in the present context are the mergers of super massive black hole ( smbh ) binaries , with typical masses @xmath18 . assuming that @xmath19 of the mass is radiated during the burst , for the bwm strain at a distance of @xmath20 due to a smbh merger with total mass @xmath21",
    ", we arrive at an estimate @xmath22 .",
    "as we shall show below , this strain is within the reach of pulsar timing measurements .",
    "this estimate can be made more precise .",
    "the bwm amplitude from smbh merger is given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) from @xcite : @xmath23 in the above expression , @xmath24 is the total mass of smbh , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the angle the binary angular momentum and the line of sight .",
    "this formula can be rewritten in the form : @xmath27 averaging over @xmath26 yields : @xmath28 estimates of @xmath29 can be obtained from calculations of @xcite which give @xmath30 from 3.6@xmath31 to 10@xmath32 . in the present work , we shall use the mean value of @xmath33 .",
    "for equal - mass smbh system with @xmath34 ) and zero orbital eccentricity at a distance of @xmath35 , we obtain : @xmath36    at this point it is instructive to compare the typical strain associated with the bwm signal from smbh merger with the strain amplitude associated with the inspiral phase prior to the smbh merger . the characteristic strain amplitude associated with the inspiral phase",
    "is given by @xcite [ inspiralh ] h^insp10 ^ -15 ( ) ( ) , for the inspiral of smbh of comparable masses .",
    "although the characteristic strains associated with the bwm and the inspiral have comparable amplitudes , they lead to different timing residual signatures . in a nutshell ,",
    "the qualitative difference in the residuals arises because the bwm signal is characterized by a permanent offset of gw field which leads to linear growth of the residuals with time , whereas the inspiral signal has a quasi - periodic time varying gw field and consequently does not lead to linear growth of the residuals ( see section [ sectioniii ] ) .    in order to gain further insight , it is helpful to present a heuristic argument for concentrating our effort on the signature of bwm signal in pulsar timing residuals instead of the inspiral signal although both have the comparable characteristic strains .",
    "we refer the reader to section [ sectioniv ] for a rigorous calculation , however for the purpose of order - of - magnitude estimation , it is reasonable to assume that the signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) associated with pta measurement of bwm and inspiral signal are related as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 are timing residuals associated with the bwm and inspiral signal , respectively .",
    "the bwm residuals grow linearly with time @xmath40 ( see section [ sectioniii ] ) , where @xmath41 is the total duration of observation . in the case of an inspiral signal due to its quasi - periodic nature",
    "the residuals oscillate with a characteristic amplitude @xmath42 , where @xmath43^{-1}$ ] is the characteristic frequency associated with the inspiral ( which is the frequency at the last stable circular orbit ) .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath44 , the expected ratio is : ~~t_obs _ insp~210 ^ 4 . for this reason , in what follows , we shall ignore the possible contribution to the pulsar timing signal coming from inspiral of the smbh binary .",
    "the crude estimation above shows that the amplitude of bwm from smbh mergers is within the expected reach of pulsar timing measurements .",
    "thus , the prospect of detecting the bwm signal from smbh binary mergers crucially depends on the expected event rate .",
    "a typical pulsar timing measurement lasts for a period of @xmath45 . for this reason ,",
    "if the event rate in a volume of @xmath46 is larger or comparable to @xmath47 , it is likely that a pulsar timing measurement would be able to detect such an event .",
    "the event rate of smbh mergers remains very uncertain .",
    "various theoretical models predict rates that differ by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the smbh merger rate primarily depends on two factors both of which need further study .",
    "the first factor is the number of merging galaxies that contain smbh in the mass range of our interest .",
    "the second factor is the fraction of galaxy mergers that leads to smbh mergers .",
    "the galaxy merger rate at redshifts @xmath48 is around one per year ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , simply assuming that each of the merging galaxies contains an smbh and that these smbh coalesce in each galaxy merger , the smbh merger rate should also be around one per year .",
    "although very crude , these estimates indicate that the smbh merger rate is in the right ball - park to be detected in pulsar timing measurements .",
    "the event rate for smbh mergers in the mass range @xmath49 was calculated to be @xmath50 in @xcite .",
    "these mergers occur for redshifts @xmath51 , with maximum event rate at @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , their calculations show that at least over @xmath53 of smbh mergers have mass ratios larger than @xmath54 . a concordant number for the expected event rate , of @xmath55 for smbh merger at redshifts @xmath48 with total mass @xmath56 comes from @xcite .",
    "moreover , as suggested by fig .",
    "6b in @xcite , the event rate for smbh mergers with masses @xmath57 can be about @xmath58 , albeit coming primarily from a larger redshift @xmath59 .",
    "along with the theoretical estimates of the smbh merger event rates , recent studies @xcite suggest @xmath60 for the rate of major galaxy mergers . assuming that each major galaxy merger is associated with smbh binary coalescence , both numerical estimations and observational data",
    "allows us to conclude that a rate of one event per ten years of observations within a redshift of @xmath61 is not unrealistic .",

    "a gw burst with memory with an amplitude of @xmath172 leaves the characteristic imprint in the pulsar timing residuals and can be detected in a 10-years run of pulsar timing array observations with the present - day characteristics at a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath127 .",
    "such a signal is expected to be produced by the coalescence of two smbh with equal masses around @xmath173 at a distance of 1 gpc .",
    "we estimate the rate of smbh coalescences producing the bwm with such an amplitude to be around a few hundredth per year .",
    "the number of detections of such gw bursts from smbh mergings by a pta array with given characteristics is given by eq .",
    "( [ number_of_detection ] ) that shows a strong dependence on the total time of observations and the noise level in pulsar timing residuals .",
    "it is expected that increase in the pta sensitivity in the near future will allow detection of bwm from coalescing smbhs at a signal - to - noise ratio more than three .",
    "future radiotelescopes , especially ska , will be able to increase the sensitivity several times due to the decrease in timing residual noise and the extension of number of pulsars in pulsar timing program , thus making this method complementary to the lisa space mission for detection of coalescing smbhs with masses @xmath174 to which the sensitivity of lisa is reduced .",
    "finally , it is worth pointing out that the analysis conducted in this paper is applicable for any source of bwm , not specifically restricted to gw signals from smbh mergers . as was mentioned above , bwm",
    "are a generic feature of gw sources that emit energy in an asymmetric fashion .",
    "these bwm events will leave an imprint in pulsar timing residuals as long as they are sufficiently bright @xmath175 .",
    "when this paper was already submitted , two studies dealing with the influence of bwm on pta appeared @xcite .",
    "results of @xcite are based on bayesian analysis method and give the same conclusions , results of @xcite with different treatment of background noise is somewhere more pessimistic .",
