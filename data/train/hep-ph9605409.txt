    "`` light - front field theory '' is an attempt to apply hamiltonian techniques to relativistic field theory ; the idea is to quantize a theory on a surface of constant @xmath0 and calculate eigenstates of the invariant mass squared operator @xmath1 . in order to partially regulate a theory , one can simply impose ( anti-)periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath2 coordinate ; this is known as `` discretized light cone quantization '' ( dlcq ) @xcite since the momenta conjugate to @xmath2 become discrete .",
    "one can use dlcq to construct a basis of states for use in numerical calculations .",
    "why would one want to use dlcq in a large scale numerical calculation ? ideally , one would employ a basis of polynomial - type wavefunctions to solve the bound state equation @xcite .",
    "with such a basis , convergence of the eigenvalues is typically exponentially fast .",
    "however , the practitioner faces several difficulties in applying this approach to a many particle calculation . in general , the resulting basis is not orthogonal and the resulting hamiltonian matrix is no longer very sparse .",
    "second , matrix elements become difficult to compute since they involve complicated integrals .",
    "it is not clear that the faster convergence of such a basis can compensate for these added difficulties .",
    "in contrast , a dlcq basis is orthogonal and the corresponding hamiltonian matrix is sparse .",
    "also , matrix elements are easily calculated ; no integrals need to be evaluated .",
    "this is important since the time required to calculate matrix elements is currently the limiting factor in large calculations .",
    "finally , as a regulator , dlcq has an appealing physical interpretation in terms of ( anti-)periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , dlcq has one distinct disadvantage : it converges quite slowly in the small mass limit .",
    "this is especially of concern for the transverse lattice @xcite where the continuum limit is precisely the small mass limit . in particular , the lowest eigenvalue and measurements of the string tension",
    "are strongly affected by this slow convergence . as we shall see",
    ", the source of this slow convergence comes from the end - point behavior of the wavefunction which is handled poorly by dlcq . using the t hooft equation as an example",
    ", we will study this behavior and suggest a solution that can be easily applied to other theories and large numerical calculations .",
    "the t hooft equation @xcite is the bound state equation for two quarks in the large @xmath3 limit of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional qcd : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the lorentz invariant mass eigenvalue associated with eigenfunction @xmath6 .",
    "a cauchy principle value prescription is assumed throughout . the spectrum is shown in fig .  [ spec ] .",
    "following t hooft , let us analyze the endpoint behavior of the wavefunction .",
    "assume @xmath7 for small @xmath8 , the bound state equation ( [ thooft ] ) becomes @xmath9 substituting @xmath10 , we obtain , in the @xmath11 limit , @xmath12 convergence of the integral ( [ int ] ) implies @xmath13 . for small mass @xmath14 @xmath15 in addition",
    ", one can derive an expression for the lowest eigenvalue in this limit @xmath16",
    "exact solutions of the t hooft equation ( [ thooft ] ) are not known and one must resort to numerical techniques . for the purpose of comparison , we will introduce a basis of wavefunctions of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some polynomial of order @xmath19 and @xmath20 is given by eqn .",
    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "such a basis provides very quick numerical convergence @xcite .",
    "later , when i quote `` exact eigenvalues , '' i will use results from such a calculation .",
    "alternatively , we can use dlcq to solve the bound state equation .",
    "we discretize the momentum fraction @xmath8 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 for integer - valued `` harmonic resolution '' @xmath23 .",
    "physically , this discretization corresponds to applying anti - periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath2 direction where @xmath24 is the continuum limit .",
    "the dlcq version of the bound state equation ( [ thooft ] ) is @xmath25 although a proof is lacking , numerical evidence suggests that the dlcq eigenvalues converge as @xmath26 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the lowest dlcq eigenvalue as a function of @xmath23 together with a numerical fit to @xmath27 where the `` exact eigenvalue '' ( from a polynomial basis calculation ) is @xmath28 .",
    "note that the dlcq bound state equation does not make use of our knowledge of the endpoint behavior of the wavefunction .",
    "this is , in fact , the source of the slow dlcq convergence .",
    "we can include the endpoint behavior by adding and subtracting a term from the t hooft equation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 the dlcq version of this equation is @xmath31 where we evaluate the integral @xmath32 exactly . based on the endpoint analysis , the integrand in eqn .",
    "( [ thooft2 ] ) should vanish when both @xmath8 and @xmath33 are near one of the endpoints .",
    "thus , the corresponding discretization ( [ improved ] ) should have small errors in this region .",
    "we will refer to this form of the bound state equation as `` improved dlcq . ''",
    "let us see how this affects convergence of the spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we see that the dlcq results converge slowly and , in fact , have an incorrect functional form for @xmath34 versus @xmath14 in the small @xmath14 limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the improved dlcq eigenvalues are nearly identical to the exact result .    however , this absence of finite @xmath23 corrections is the result of a fortuitous accident : for small @xmath14 , the lowest eigenfunction is @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the last term of eqn .",
    "( [ improved ] ) is almost zero for all @xmath36 and @xmath37 and _ all _ finite @xmath23 corrections vanish .",
    "examining an excited state , where the wavefunction has a more complicated form , will give us a better picture of what happens in the generic case .",
    "ordinarily , dlcq eigenvalues converge as @xmath26 due to the endpoint regions @xmath38 and @xmath39 plus @xmath40 errors due to the @xmath41 singularity  @xcite .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the dlcq eigenvalues of the second excited state are fitted to powers of @xmath26 plus powers of @xmath40 , @xmath42 while the improved dlcq eigenvalues are fitted to powers of @xmath40 , @xmath43 the exact result is @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to note that improved dlcq removes the errors associated with the endpoint regions but does not significantly affect the @xmath40 errors . finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we see how convergence behaves as a function of @xmath14 for the second excited state .    so far , we have discussed the two particle bound state equation .",
    "the generalization to a dlcq calculation with more particles is straightforward .",
    "for example , consider the following terms from the schwinger model hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath45 in the two particle sector , this hamiltonian produces the dlcq version of the t hooft equation ( [ dlcq ] ) . the improved dlcq version of ( [ relevant ] ) is @xmath46 where @xmath47 we have replaced the second term of ( [ relevant ] ) by a four - point interaction since the improved dlcq subtraction is sensitive to the momenta of both particles . the improved form ( [ imp2 ] )",
    "will remove the slow convergence from a many particle calculation .",
    "there have been some past attempts to quantify the errors associated with dlcq . the claim in ref .",
    "@xcite that the leading error is @xmath40 is certainly incorrect . in ref .",
    "@xcite , periodic boundary conditions were applied to a somewhat different theory . in that case , a leading error of @xmath48 seemed to explain the data .",
    "there are a large number of dlcq studies which have suffered from this slow convergence problem .",
    "this includes dlcq studies of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional qcd @xcite , studies of the schwinger model  @xcite ( as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , dimensionally reduced theories  @xcite , and the transverse lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , one should note that there are many cases where the slow convergence problem is not important : it is only of concern when @xmath14 is small but nonzero ( the dlcq subtraction is correct when @xmath49 ) and @xmath40 errors can dominate in a many particle calculation ( where the size of @xmath23 is somewhat limited ) .",
