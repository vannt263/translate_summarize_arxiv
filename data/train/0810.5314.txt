    "the motion of small particles in a gas disk has been investigated in detail since this is essential for planet formation theory . in a number of work ,",
    "an axisymmetric gas disk is assumed and the effects of the structure of the gas disk on particle orbit are investigated , neglecting the effects of planet s gravitational force ( adachi et al .",
    "1976 , weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "their results show that particles with stopping timescale of the order of kepler timescale migrate towards the central star rapidly , thereby imposing a serious barrier on the formation of planetesimals .",
    "although this poses a serious question on the formation of planetesimals , there is another aspect of this fact in the formation of gas giant core .",
    "gas giant core should reach the critical mass to accrete nearby gas rapidly ( mizuno et al . 1978 ) , and its formation timescale seems to be very long ( pollack et al .",
    "if the global pressure gradient exerted on the gas disk will force the particles to migrate towards the central star , the particles at outer disk may reach the orbit of an already formed core and may accrete onto it .",
    "kary et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have shown that this process seems to be possible but most of the particles may miss the planet since they migrate very rapidly .",
    "their discussion is based on the three - body problem including the effect of axisymmetric gas disk .",
    "the assumption of axisymmetric gas disk is a simplification in order to make the calculation tractable .",
    "the planet gravitationally interacts with the gas disk and changes the structure of the disk around it , producing the spiral density wave ( see e.g. , goldreich and tremaine 1979 ) .",
    "only recently does appear the investigation of particle motion around the planet embedded in a gas disk , which fully takes into account the structure around the planet ( paardekooper and mellema 2004 , 2006 , paardekooper 2007 , fouchet et al .",
    "2007 , lyra et al . 2008 ) .",
    "for instance , paardekooper and mellema ( 2004 , 2006 ) and paardekooper ( 2007 ) numerically calculated the particle motion around a high mass planet in the presence of a gas disk and discussed the accretion of the particles onto the planet and the formation of gap of particles of different size .",
    "they concluded that minimum mass of the planet that opens up a dust gap was @xmath0 , thereby indicating the possibility of detecting a low mass planet by future observations by observing a dust gap .",
    "many of such works involve numerical studies on particle motion . in this paper , we present an analytic investigation of the motion of particles around a low mass planet embedded in a gas disk , taking into account of the structure around the planet .",
    "this is the full analytic solution of a particle motion around the planet in which the structure of the gas disk is fully taken into account .",
    "we consider a vertically averaged disk and perform two - dimensional analysis for simplicity .",
    "we use the results of ( quasi-)linear calculation of the gas structure around the planet and calculate the distant encounter between a particle and a planet embedded in a gaseous disk .",
    "we derive a formula which describes the secular change of the semi - major axis of the particle caused by the encounter with the planet using hill s equations .",
    "it is not possible to describe the resonant capture discussed by weidenschilling and davis ( 1985 ) or kary et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; however , we take into account the structure of the gaseous disk that is modified by the planet , which is not considered in most of the previous analytic works .",
    "our paper is complementary with previous numerical studies in two respects .",
    "firstly , our analysis is focused on low mass planet , and secondly , our treatment is analytic .",
    "it is challenging to follow numerically the motion of dust particles embedded in a gas disk for long timescale ( e.g. , @xmath1 kepler time ) , solving gas and the motion of dust simultaneously .",
    "therefore , analytic treatment may be necessary in order to understand the secular motion of dust particles .",
    "moreover , basic physical processes in the problem become clear by analytic treatment .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ analytic ] , we show analytic treatment of the problem and derive the formula for the evolution of semi - major axis , equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) .",
    "this formula includes the effects of global pressure gradient of gas disk , steady , axisymmetric mass accretion flow of the gas , gravitational force from the planet , and the gas velocity structure modified by the planet .",
    "we then compare our results with numerical calculations in sections [ numerical ] and [ global ] , and the limitations of our analytic approach are discussed . in section [ dustgap ] , we discuss the conditions for dust gap formation and long - term behavior of dust particles whose orbits are close to an embedded planet .",
    "section [ summary ] is for summary and future prospects .",
    "we expect that our results , equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) , can be used as a tool for estimate radial motion of the particle in a disk around the planet , since this is written in an analytic form",
    ". it may be possible to calculate the radial distribution of particles of various sizes using this formula and derive , for example , the opacity of the disk .",
    "we recommend readers who need only the final results of the particle motion just to refer equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) directly and go to section [ discuss : dustdistribution ] where we demonstrate the calculation of radial dust distribution around a planet .    before proceeding to the details of calculations",
    ", we note that there are two relevant length scales in the problem at hand : pressure scale height @xmath2 of the gas disk and hill s radius of the planet , @xmath3 .",
    "pressure scale height is an important quantity for the structure of gas modified by the gravitational force of the planet , while hill s radius is important for the orbit of particles .",
    "pressure scale height that is given by sound speed of the gas @xmath4 divided by keplerian angular velocity and hill s radius of the planet are related by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the semi - major axis of the planet , @xmath7 is the mass of the planet , and @xmath8 is the mass of the central star . for low mass planets considered in this paper , @xmath9 is smaller than unity .",
    "in this section , we analytically investigate the particle motion under the influence of gravitational force by the protoplanet and gas drag using local approximation .",
    "we show that particles with friction time of the order kepler time will migrate towards the planet because of the gas drag , although gravitational scattering tends to repel the particle from the planet .",
    "this mechanism is different from the inward migration of dust particles caused by the velocity difference between the gas and dust [ see e.g. , adachi et al .",
    "( 1976 ) or weidenschilling ( 1977 ) ] . we also derive the effects of the modification of gas velocity due to the gravitational force of the planet .",
    "we use hill s approximation to investigate the encounter between the particle and the planet .",
    "we consider the motion only in @xmath10 plane where @xmath11 is in radial direction and @xmath12 is in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we assume the planet is fixed at the origin @xmath13 in this coordinate and neglect the mass of the particle .",
    "we write the velocity of the gas @xmath14 by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the keplerian angular velocity of the planet and @xmath17 is the unit vector in the @xmath12-direction .",
    "the first term represents the keplerian motion around the central star and the second term @xmath18 represents the deviation from this motion , which , for instance , may be caused by the global pressure gradient of the disk .",
    "the equations of motion of the particle are @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the drag coefficient .",
    "the quantity @xmath21 is a reciprocal of the stopping time of a particle .",
    "note that there are various notations for this parameter . in weidenschilling ( 1977 ) , stopping time is denoted by @xmath22 so @xmath21 in this paper is equal to @xmath23 . in adachi et al .",
    "( 1976 ) , stopping time corresponds to their @xmath24 times gas density times relative velocity .",
    "we write the sum of the force exerted by the planet and the part of the friction force caused by the non - keplerian motion of the gas by @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gravitational constant and @xmath7 denotes the mass of the planet .",
    "we give a brief note on the relationship between the dust size and drag coefficient . in this paper , we use the constant drag coefficient @xmath21 for mathematical convenience . the dust size @xmath28 and the drag coefficient @xmath21",
    "are related by @xmath29 for epstein law and @xmath30 for stokes law .",
    "simple relationship between the dust size and drag coefficient may be given by @xmath31      10 ^ 4 \\left ( { { \\displaystyle \\frac{d}{1\\mathrm{cm } } }   } \\right)^{-2 }    &      { { \\displaystyle \\frac{10^{-9 } \\mathrm{g / cm}^3}{\\rho_0 } }   } < { { \\displaystyle \\frac{d}{1\\mathrm{cm } } }   }    \\end{array }    \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the background density and @xmath28 is the size of the particle . figure [ fig : size_drag ] shows the relationship between dust size and drag coefficient given by this equation for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the assumption of constant drag coefficient is not true for large bodies whose drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity difference .",
    "however , we expect that the results are qualitatively similar even for large bodies .",
    "we neglect the effects of gravitational potential caused by gas disk .",
    "it is a good approximation for non - self - gravitating disk as shown in section [ subsec : db_spiral ] .    in the absence of the planet and the friction force ,",
    "the particle motion is the keplerian motion around the central star . in our setup , this is represented by four orbital elements @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath38 physically , @xmath39 is the difference of orbital semi - major axis between the planet and the particle , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are quantities related to the orbital eccentricity , and @xmath42 is related to the initial azimuthal position of the particle .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the orbital elements caused by the planet s gravitational force and the friction due to the gas .",

    "we derive the change of orbital semi - major axis @xmath47 by the encounter .",
    "the formal solutions of equations ( [ eq_h ] ) and ( [ eq_k ] ) are given by @xmath48 + 2f_y(t - u )      \\cos [ \\omega_{\\rm p } ( t - u ) ]   \\right\\ }    \\label{sol_h}\\ ] ] @xmath49 - 2f_y(t - u )      \\sin [ \\omega_{\\rm p } ( t - u ) ]   \\right\\ } ,    \\label{sol_k}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the location of the particle at time @xmath53 given by equations ( [ orbit_x ] ) and ( [ orbit_y ] ) and so for @xmath54 .",
    "substituting equations ( [ sol_h ] ) and ( [ sol_k ] ) into equation ( [ eq_b ] ) , we find @xmath55 changing the integration variable @xmath56 in the first integral of the second line and using the formula @xmath57 and @xmath58 we find @xmath59    this equation formally describes the amount of change of semi - major axis .",
    "we note that the integration with respect to @xmath53 must be performed along the particle s trajectory .",
    "the force @xmath25 consists of two parts [ see equation ( [ force_general ] ) ] .",
    "one is the gravitational force of the planet and the other is the non - keplerian motion of the gas velocity .",
    "we now see these effects separately .",
    "first , we consider the change of the semi - major axis caused by the planet .",
    "we assume that the trajectory of the particle is close to circular orbit .",
    "we approximate @xmath60 by @xmath61 with this approximation , we obtain @xmath62 for the integration of @xmath54 , we can use the well - known result of restricted three - body problem ( see e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1980 , hnon & petit 1986 , or hasegawa & nakazawa 1990 ) .",

    "the derivation of this equation is outlined in appendix [ app : fy_int ] .",
    "substituting equations ( [ fx_integral ] ) and ( [ fy_integral ] ) into equation ( [ deltab_integral ] ) , we obtain @xmath66 where @xmath3 is the hill s radius of the planet defined by @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a numerical factor @xmath69 ^ 2 = 30.094\\ ] ]    the second term of equation ( [ deltab_planet ] ) represents the effect of gravitational scattering .",
    "the particle and the planet tends to repel each other by mutual gravitational interaction , which is a well - known result of restricted three - body problem .",
    "this effect remains when drag force vanishes ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "when there is no drag force , the gravitational interaction between the planet and the particle results in the excitation of eccentricity and the difference in semi - major axes of the two increases since jacobi energy must be conserved in the absence of any dissipative force .    when friction force is large , gravitational scattering is ineffective since the gas drag enforces the particle to move with the fluid element .",
    "the first term of the equation ( [ deltab_planet ] ) shows that the orbits of the planet and the particle tend to attract each other and this is most efficient when @xmath71 .",
    "the intuitive explanation of this effect is as follows .",
    "when the particle feels the gravitational force of the planet , it is attracted towards the planet s position at first .",
    "then , when the gas drag is effective , the gas enforces the particle to stay at the kepler orbit at the location where the particle is attracted , resulting in the attraction of the semi - major axes of the particle and the planet . if the drag force is taken into account , the semi - major axis difference between the planet and the particle can shrink since jacobi energy is not necessarily conserved .",
    "since the attraction of the semi - major axes of the particle and the planet in the presence of drag force represented by the first term of equation ( [ deltab_planet ] ) is proportional to @xmath72 at large @xmath39 , this overwhelms the effect of scattering represented by the second term , which is proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that particles far away from the planet are attracted towards the planet when the gas velocity equals keplerian rotation velocity .    in the vicinity of the planet",
    ", it is expected that gravitational scattering is more effective since this effect increases as @xmath73 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 where these two effects are comparable is given by @xmath74 , that is @xmath75 this indicates that particles with @xmath76 may move towards the planet even in the absence of the global pressure gradient .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the change of the semi - major axis caused by the effect of non - keplerian rotation of the gas , which is due to the presence of global pressure gradient .",
    "the result of this section is already derived by previous studies such as adachi et al .",
    "( 1976 ) or weidenschilling ( 1977 ) , but we briefly show the results in this formulation for completeness .    we parameterize the degree of non - keplerian rotation by @xmath77 and write the velocity difference @xmath18 by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the rotation velocity of the planet around the central star , @xmath80 .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 is non - dimensional and its magnitude is the order of the square of the disk aspect ratio .",
    "this is negative for the disk with negative pressure gradient .    since @xmath18 is constant , it is easy to integrate ( [ deltab_integral ] ) to obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the time taken for the particle to cross the box . as is well - known , this effect is most efficient for the particle with @xmath83 .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider the change of the semi - major axis caused by the steady accretion ( or deccretion ) flow .",
    "this may be modeled by the constant axisymmetric radial velocity @xmath84 .",
    "we parameterize the radial velocity by non - dimensional factor @xmath85 as follows , @xmath86 the parameter @xmath85 denotes the ratio between the radial flow velocity and the kepler velocity . if the dissipation of the gaseous nebula is due to the gas accretion , the sign of @xmath85 is negative and its magnitude is the order of @xmath87 , which is indicated from observation ( see , e.g. , haisch et al . 2001 ) .",
    "drag force due to the gas is given by @xmath88 and therefore , using equation ( [ deltab_integral ] ) , we find @xmath89 we note that the steady accretion flow effect is important for small particles , which have large drag coefficient @xmath21 , since such particles move in the same way as the gas flow .      in this section , we consider the change of the orbital semi - major axis of the particle caused by the deviation of the gas velocity from keplerian rotation velocity due to the presence of the planet . in this section",
    ", @xmath18 is caused by the gravitational interaction between gas and the embedded planet , in contrast to the previous sections .",
    "we show that only axisymmetric structure of the disk causes the change of the semi - major axis of the particle .    in order to calculate the velocity perturbation caused by the planet , we solve vertically averaged euler equations using local shearing - sheet approximation : @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the surface density",

    "we assume that background surface density @xmath97 is constant and background gas is rotating with kepler velocity @xmath98 .",
    "we neglect the effect of the global pressure gradient or steady mass accretion since it is calculated separately in the previous subsections .    the first order perturbation of the flow is caused by the planet gravity .",
    "we denote the first order perturbation of physical variables by superscript @xmath99 .",
    "the linearization of equations ( [ eoc_hydro ] ) and ( [ eom_hydro ] ) are @xmath100 assuming that vorticity is not created by the formation of the planet , we have @xmath101 see , e.g. , narayan et al . ( 1987 ) .",
    "note that @xmath97 appears only in the form of @xmath102 and therefore , this value itself does not depend on the background surface density .",

    "we are now in the position to calculate @xmath115 due to the structure of the gas disk modified by the planet s gravity . using equation ( [ deltab_integral ] ) and drag force",
    "is given by @xmath88 , we have @xmath161 the integration must be performed along the path of the particle . the first term of equation ( [ deltab_deltav_int ] ) dominates when @xmath140 . in the perfect coupling limit ,",
    "since the particle traces the flow of the fluid element , this integral should vanish .",
    "we expect that this integral always remains small and set the first term of equation ( [ deltab_deltav_int ] ) to be zero .",
    "we expect that this approximation is valid since the second term that is proportional to @xmath162 dominates @xmath115 when @xmath21 is small .",
    "we later confirm this numerically .",
    "we then consider the second term of equation ( [ deltab_deltav_int ] ) .",
    "the leading order of this integration is obtained by approximating that the particle orbit is circular . since @xmath163",

    "we note that in deriving equation ( [ deltab_spiral ] ) , we have repeatedly used the assumption of no vorticity source , equation ( [ vorticity ] ) . in the presence of vorticity source",
    ", @xmath165 may be different and the mass flux may be present .      adding equations ( [ deltab_planet ] ) , ( [ deltab_nonkepler ] ) , ( [ deltab_accretion ] ) , and ( [ deltab_spiral ] )",
    ", we obtain the expression for the secular evolution of the orbital semi - major axis of the particle .",
    "we write in the form of the rate of the change by dividing @xmath115 by @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the box size of the @xmath12-direction of the coordinate system considered .",
    "time @xmath82 may be interpreted as the time interval between successive conjunctions between the particle and the planet .",
    "the result is @xmath168    { { \\displaystyle \\frac{\\nu \\omega_{\\rm p}}{\\nu^2+\\omega_{\\rm p}^2 } }   } ,    \\label{deltab_final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is hill s radius of the planet , the definitions of @xmath77 and @xmath85 are given by equations ( [ parameter_nonkepler ] ) and ( [ parameter_accretion ] ) respectively , and the value of @xmath68 is @xmath169 .",
    "if the planet mass is sufficiently small , the leading contribution comes from the first term , which is due to the global pressure gradient exerted on the gas disk . comparing the order of magnitude of the first and the third term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) , the third term becomes dominant for particles with @xmath170 where we have assumed @xmath171 , @xmath172 and all the numerical coefficients are neglected . for low mass planets which does not form a gap in the gas disk , hill s radius is generally smaller than the scale height .",
    "therefore , the motion of the particle is predominated by the effect of global pressure gradient . however , for large planets with mass of order jupiter , the effect of the global pressure gradient is small compared to the gravitational interaction between the planet , and equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) indicates that if the profile of the gas disk is neglected , the particles may be attracted towards the planet .",
    "this seems to be consistent with what is found by paardekooper ( 2007 ) .",
    "he found that when axisymmetric gas disk profile is considered , plants with the mass of the order of jupiter would accrete the particles with stopping time comparable to kepler time , while accretion of such particles around planets with 0.1 times jupiter mass would be inefficient ( see figures 7 and 11 of paardekooper 2007 ) .",
    "when global pressure gradient of gas disk drives the particles to migrate towards the central star , a part of particles with @xmath83 may pass the orbit of the planet without accumulating onto it , since the particle migration rate is very fast and the perturbation of the orbital elements of the particles is not related to the planet location ( kary et al .",
    "if the third term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) dominates over the global pressure effect , on the other hand , particles will accumulate onto the planet since their orbital elements are strongly perturbed at the location of the planet .    if the disk model with flat pressure profile is considered , the behavior of the particle around the planet is complicated .",
    "figure [ fig : db_contour ] shows the contour plot of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) for the planet mass @xmath173 , flat pressure profile ( @xmath174 ) , and no mass accretion onto the central star ( @xmath175 ) . for small particles ( @xmath140 ) , there is no secular motion of particles since all the terms of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) vanishes if @xmath175 .",
    "the motion of small particles is determined by the strength of accretion of the background flow . for large particles ( @xmath176 ) , on the other hand , the fourth term , which is the gravitational scattering by the planet , is dominant and the particles are always repeled away from the planet . for particles with intermediate size ( @xmath83 ) , all the terms must be considered .",
    "particles located sufficiently far away from the planet are scattered away because of the contribution from the last term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) , which is due to the axisymmetric mode of the perturbed flow structure caused by the planet gravity .",
    "particles at the intermediate distance ( @xmath177 ) , on the other hand , are attracted towards the planet because of the third term .",
    "if the particles are close to the planet , they are again scattered away because of the contribution from gravitational scattering .",
    "the equilibrium distance between the third and fourth term is given by equation ( [ b_eq_grav ] ) , and this becomes close to the planet with increasing @xmath21 , and it eventually becomes smaller than the hill s radius , where we expect that the particle motion is largely dominated by the planet s gravity and our treatment of distant encounter breaks down .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the particles with intermediate but still smaller drag coefficient , on one hand , will accumulate around the planet , but not fully accrete onto the planet . on the other hand , particles with larger drag coefficient",
    "will accrete onto the planet since gravitational scattering is ineffective in this case . equating the equilibrium distance given by equation ( [ b_eq_grav ] ) to hill s radius ,",
    "the critical drag coefficient separating these two regimes is of order @xmath178 .",

    "we perform a numerical calculation of hill s equations and investigate the validity of assumptions in the derivation of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) .",
    "it needs to be checked whether particles will really accrete onto the planet when they approach towards the planet . for close encounter",

    "this is indicated by the mismatch between the locations of the resonances .",
    "it is also indicated that the local calculations reproduce the results of global calculations most efficiently for small particles , such as @xmath288 .",
    "local approach that is used in section [ analytic ] is valid when semi - major axis difference @xmath39 is much smaller than the scale of the semi - major axis of the planet : @xmath289 which is equivalent to @xmath290 note that in the usage of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) there is another limitation of close encounter , which has already been addressed in section [ subsec : limitation_local ] .",
    "paardekooper and mellema ( 2004 , 2006 ) showed that dust gap may be opened up even if the planet mass is too small to open up a gap in a gas disk using numerical calculation .",
    "we reconsider this result from the analytical point of view in this section .    since there is no long - term radial motion of fluid elements , it is essential in dust gap formation that gas and dust moves in a different velocity .",
    "terms that are important in equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) are therefore those proportional to @xmath291 for small particles .",
    "we first consider the disk without global pressure gradient . in this case , the motion of small dust particles are mainly dominated by the third term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) when they are as close to the planet as @xmath292 and by the last term when @xmath39 is larger .",
    "the third term is the attraction of particles by the planet s gravity and they migrate towards the planet .",
    "the last term on the other hand originates from the axisymmetric flow structure around the planet .",
    "this term causes dust particles migrate away from the planet . in either case ,",
    "dust particles around the planet with @xmath293 forms a gap around the planet . taking @xmath294 , very rough order - of - magnitude estimate ( neglecting numerical coefficients of order unity ) gives the migration timescale of dust particles as @xmath295 where @xmath296 denotes the kepler timescale and @xmath8 is the mass of the central star .",
    "this is the timescale of dust particles changing its orbit by the order of scale height and gives the timescale of the formation of dust gap with width of the order of the scale height .",
    "if there is global pressure gradient , the first term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) may dominate over the terms considered above . since global pressure gradient causes systematic inward or outward motion of particles , dust gap around the planet",
    "is not expected to form if this term dominates .",
    "the timescale of orbital change of dust particles by the order of scale height due to the first term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) is @xmath297 if the magnitude of @xmath77 is of order @xmath298 , which is a standard value , dust gap may not appear around the planet since @xmath299 .",
    "however if @xmath77 is as small as @xmath300 , dust gap formation may be possible .",
    "the value of @xmath77 depends on disk model and can take values of wide range . from theoretical point of view ,",
    "small value of @xmath77 is preferable in order for meter - size particles to survive in a minimum mass solar nebula .",
    "one mechanism of decreasing @xmath77 around ice line is suggested by kretke and lin ( 2007 ) .    comparing the first and the third term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] )",
    ", we obtain the criterion of dust gap formation . again , for @xmath294 , and neglecting numerical coefficients of order unity , we have , for the gap formation criterion , @xmath301 we note that this criterion does not depend on drag coefficient of the particles .",
    "however , the implicit assumption is that gravitational scattering , which is the fourth term of equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) , is ineffective , which is proportianl to @xmath302 .",
    "therefore , this condition applies to particles with @xmath303 .",
    "taking @xmath304 and @xmath305 , this gives @xmath306 , which explains the condition obtained by paardekooper and mellema ( 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "timescale constraint of dust gap formation may be obtained by comparing the above obtained timescale with the timescale of planet migration or gas dispersal timescale .",
    "timescale of the type i planet migration of the radial distance comparable to the scale height is given by tanaka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as @xmath307 therefore , comparing this with @xmath308 , we have @xmath309 dust gap formation is efficient at late stage of planet formation when gas starts to dissipate and type i migration timescale becomes long .",
    "if @xmath255 and @xmath310 , this criterion gives @xmath311 . if there is no type i migration , on the other hand , this constraint is relaxed and dust gap formation constraint is given by the timescale of disk gas dispersal , @xmath312 . if @xmath312 is of the order of @xmath189 years , gap of particles with @xmath313 may be opened up .      in order to investigate the qualitative behavior of dust particles around the planet in long time , we model the motion of particles in the disk by one - dimensional advection equation @xmath314 = 0    \\label{dustadvection_eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath315 is the radial velocity of the dust particles whose semi - major axis difference with the planet is @xmath39 and @xmath316 is the appropriately normalized number of the particles with semi - major axis difference @xmath39 at time @xmath53 .",
    "we use equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) for @xmath317 and solve ( [ dustadvection_eqn ] ) for @xmath318 for particles with various drag coefficients .",
    "we have used second - order scheme with monotonicity condition ( van leer 1977 ) .",
    "we fix @xmath2 and @xmath4 for simplicity in our computational domain and a planet with @xmath319 is fixed at the origin .",
    "planet mass corresponds to @xmath320 for @xmath211 and @xmath210 .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath321 and dust particles are homogeneously distributed initially : @xmath322 in this region .",
    "we have assumed that there is no dust particle out of this domain .",
    "for @xmath82 that appears in equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) , we have assumed @xmath323 where @xmath324 is keplerian angular velocity and @xmath325 is the location of the planet .",
    "figures [ fig : advection ] shows the snapshots of the distribution of dust particles of various drag coefficients at @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 for @xmath174 .",
    "the gap of particles with @xmath329 has been opened up after several @xmath1 kepler time .",
    "the gap of particles @xmath330 may be the artefact of boundary condition , since the radial velocity of particles at the nearest edge of the planet is positive but we have assumed there is no dust particles outside the calculation domain .",
    "however , there is no boundary effect for small particles with large drag coefficient , since radial velocity of dust particle is negative at the inner edge and positive at the outer edge .",
    "we note that since it takes about @xmath1 years for dust gap formation for the planet with @xmath320 , this effect is small if the gas pressure gradient is significantly large , @xmath331 .",
    "however , for larger mass planets , planet perturbation on the dust motion is large and dust gap formation is possible even in the presence of pressure gradient , as seen in the order - of - magnitude estimate provided in the previous section .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the observational implication of dust gap in the disk with zero pressure gradient .",
    "the width of the dust gap that forms around a low mass planet is several times the scale height .",
    "therefore , it might be challenging to detect a low mass planet embedded in a gas disk at @xmath332 .",
    "however , if there is a planet at several tens of au , the width of the gap can be of the order of several au , which can be resolved in near future .",
    "the gap formation timescale in this case is of order @xmath333 years , which might be comparable to disk life time .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to find a low mass planet by observing a dust gap in a gaseous nebula , even if the planet itself is too small to be observable .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the motion of particles embedded in a gas disk in the presence of a small mass planet .",
    "this is the full analytic calculation of the particle motion including the gas disk and the planet considering the non - axisymmetric pattern of the gas around the planet produced by the gravitational interaction between the planet and the gas .",
    "our main result is equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) which describes the change of the particle semi - major axis , which has been in circular motion initially , after one distant encounter with the planet .",
    "in addition to well - known particle migration towards the central star due to the pressure gradient ( the first term ) and the gravitational scattering by the planet ( fourth term ) , we have derived ( 1 ) the effect of steady mass accretion ( the second term ) , ( 2 ) attraction of particles towards the planet due to the planet s gravity ( the third term ) , and ( 3 ) contribution of the structure of the gas disk produced by the planet s gravity ( the fifth term ) .",
    "we find that only the axisymmetric structure of the gas contributes to the semi - major axis evolution of particles and the spiral structure is ineffective in the absence of vorticity source .",
    "all the terms considered , in the absence of the global pressure gradient and steady accretion flow towards the central star , we find that ( see figure [ fig : db_contour ] ) ( 1 ) particles with @xmath334 will migrate towards the planet if they are close to the planet because of the gravitational attraction by the planet , but they migrate away from the planet if they are far away , primarily due to the effect of the gas structure , ( 2 ) large particles with @xmath267 will be scattered away from the planet because of the gravitational scattering , and ( 3 ) there is a parameter range where particles are scattered away from the planet when they are close to the planet while attracted towards the planet if they are located at far away , thereby particles are accumulated at an equilibrium distance from the planet ( i.e. , shepherding by gas drag and gravitational scattering ) .",
    "this shepherding mechanism acts for particles in both interior and exterior orbits as long as the radial pressure gradient of the gas is negligible .",
    "we have checked the validity of our formula by solving three - body problem with and without hill s approximations .",
    "our main assumptions in deriving equation ( [ deltab_final ] ) are ( 1 ) initially circular orbit , ( 2 ) distant encounter , and ( 3 ) local approximation .",
    "validity of the first assumption is justified when the eccentricity of the particle is damped within the time taken for each synodic encounter that is given by equation ( [ condition_e ] ) .",
    "the valid region for the second assumption is shown by the contour of small deflection in figure [ fig : size_deflection ] .",
    "the condition for the third assumption is simply given by equation ( [ condition_local ] ) .",
    "hill s approximation is good as long as we consider the orbits in the vicinity of the planet . in short ,",
    "our formula is especially useful in predicting the motions of dust particles with stopping time @xmath335 . for particles with smaller drag ,",
    "our treatment predicts only quantitative behavior of non - resonant orbital evolution of particles whose semi - major axis is close to that of the planet .",
    "we also note that since we have made use of linear calculation for the flow , our treatment is restricted to low mass planets with the mass up to the orders of several tens of earth mass . using equation ( [ deltab_final ] )",
    ", we have discussed the criterion for dust gap formation .",
    "the condition depends on the value of global pressure gradient , mass of the planet , and disk scale height .",
    "it is possible to derive the condition suggested by paardekooper and mellema ( 2004 , 2006 ) , and we have derived more general criteria . we have calculated the qualitative long - term behavior of dust particles around a planet with @xmath320 .",
    "it is indicated that the gap of small dust particles with width of the order of several scale height may be opened up after several @xmath1 kepler time .",
    "this long timescale has not been reached by full numerical simulations yet .",
    "we have simplified the description of the drag force by assuming the force proportional to relative velocity with the gas . for large particles ,",
    "however , the drag force is proportional to the square of the relative velocity , which is not treated in our calculation .",
    "we have also made a simplification by considering two - dimensional problem . in considering the vertical motion of particles ,",
    "it is necessary to do three - dimensional calculations .",
    "the effects of magnetic field , self gravity , and turbulence of the disk will be the subjects in this line of analytical study .",
    "it is also of interest to extend our formulation to include the finite box size and investigate how the resonance effect is described in hill s system .",

    "in this section , we show that the right hand side of equation ( [ dx_calc ] ) vanishes up to second order perturbation and prove equation ( [ dx_vanish ] ) .",

    "in this section , we demonstrate that the sound wave that propagates in a homogeneous , non - rotating medium carries mass flux , and therefore , show that the vanishing mass flux given by equation ( [ massflux_vanish ] ) is not a general conclusion but specific to the problem in consideration .",
