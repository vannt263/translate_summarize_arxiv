    "constant means that the infrared behavior of gravity is well - described by the classical limit , but also implies that its ultraviolet behavior is nonrenormalizable by power - counting arguments .",
    "thus , at the quantum level gravity should presumably be regarded as only an effective low - energy limit of some more fundamental theory , such as string theory .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting to examine more carefully the quantum ( loop ) behavior of gravity , and its connection with gauge theory .",
    "the scattering amplitudes of gravitons and of gluons that have been investigated to date have proven to be quite closely related .",
    "classical ( tree - level ) amplitudes for gravity obey a ` squaring relation ' , derived by kawai , lewellen and tye ( klt ) from string theory , in which each graviton amplitude is given , roughly speaking , by the sums of products of pairs of gluon amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0-point tree - level klt relations , in conjunction with the unitarity of the @xmath13-matrix , have recently led to similar relations between four - point amplitudes at the multi - loop level , for the maximally supersymmetric versions of gravity and gauge theory , @xmath14 supergravity and @xmath15 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite .",
    "such relations have led to an improved understanding of the ultraviolet behavior of @xmath14 supergravity in various dimensions .",

    "these ` all - plus ' gravity amplitudes are closely related to the previously computed one - loop all - plus gauge amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "these self - dual theories are only defined as full quantum theories in four - dimensional space - times with an even number of time dimensions , i.e. signatures @xmath22 ( euclidean space ) and @xmath23 ( complex time ) , where the above self - dual constraint lacks an ` @xmath24 ' and is compatible with the reality of the fields . however",
    ", a self - dual sector of the full theory can be defined in signature @xmath25 ( four - dimensional minkowski space ) . at the linearized level ,",
    "the classical solutions are circularly polarized plane waves , corresponding to superpositions of states of identical helicity ( which may have different momenta ) . for such solutions in gauge theory ,",

    "the gravitational analogs of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; they similarly satisfy @xmath33 for circularly polarized gravitational waves .",
    "it is nontrivial that the connection between positive helicity amplitudes and self - duality survives the full nonlinear interactions , as demonstrated for gauge theory by duff and isham  @xcite .",
    "more recently , several authors  @xcite have shown that various sdym lagrangians  @xcite ( whose classical field equations all solve the sdym constraints ) could be used to compute the tree - level matrix elements for an off - shell gauge current to produce @xmath34 identical - helicity on - shell gluons in the full gauge theory .",
    "the tree - level scattering amplitudes that result from putting the current on - shell actually vanish for all @xmath0 by a supersymmetry ward identity ( swi )  @xcite , @xmath35 where the external states , labeled by their helicity , may be either gauge bosons or gravitons .",

    ", identical - helicity amplitudes in non - supersymmetric theories do not vanish .",
    "they are known explicitly for pure yang - mills theory for all @xmath0  @xcite .",

    "the result for the cs lagrangian , @xmath36 \\ , , \\equn\\label{cssdym}\\ ] ] where two - component spinor notation has been used , agrees with the pure - yang - mills result including the factor of two .",

    "thus the one - loop all - plus amplitudes for yang - mills theory ( gravity ) are the _ only _ nonvanishing scattering amplitudes in the cs version of sdym ( sdg ) .    to construct an ansatz for the @xmath0-point one - loop all - plus graviton amplitudes , @xmath41 ,",
    "we have used a combination of explicit computation ( for @xmath42 ) , and general analytic properties ( to infer the all-@xmath0 result ) .",
    "the analytic properties are very similar to those of the all - plus gauge amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "first of all , the unitarity cuts for the amplitudes are identically zero in four dimensions : each one - loop cut is a product of two tree amplitudes , one on each side of the cut ; but every possible assignment of helicity to the two gravitons crossing the cut leads to the vanishing of at least one of the two tree amplitudes , via .",
    "similar reasoning shows that the one - loop all - plus amplitudes do not contain multi - particle poles , of the form @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the only permitted kinematic singularities are those where one external momentum becomes soft , or two momenta become collinear .",
    "these singularities have a known universal form , which will be described in more detail below .",
    "finally , the loop - momentum integration does not generate any infrared nor ultraviolet divergences . in summary ,",
    "@xmath41 is a finite rational function of the momenta , totally symmetric in the @xmath0 arguments , with only soft and collinear singularities .    for the explicit computation , we first used the swi  ( [ vanishswi ] ) to replace the one - loop amplitude with a graviton in the loop by that with a massless scalar in the loop  @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the cuts for this scalar loop in an arbitary dimension @xmath1 , where they are nonvanishing . from the @xmath1-dimensional cut information , one can extract the @xmath45 amplitude  @xcite .",

    "to motivate the ansatz for the one - loop all - plus graviton amplitudes , we briefly describe the only other known nontrivial infinite sequence of graviton amplitudes .",
    "these are the tree amplitudes with maximal helicity violation ( mhv ) , consistent with , for which exactly two gravitons have opposite helicity from the remaining @xmath47 .",

    "in fact it is symmetric under exchange of all labels @xmath62 , as required by an @xmath14 swi  @xcite .",
    "bgk also checked the behavior of their expression as a graviton momentum becomes soft , and found the expected universal behavior  @xcite , @xmath63 where the gravitational soft factor for @xmath64 is ( for positive helicity ) @xmath65 momentum conservation can be used to show that the soft factor is also symmetric under the interchange of legs @xmath66 and @xmath67 with the others .    in general , one might expect the one - loop generalization of to contain an additional term on the right - hand side , proportional to a one - loop correction to the soft factor  ( [ gravtreesoftfactor ] ) multiplied by @xmath68 .",
    "however , @xmath68 vanishes for the all - plus helicity configuration , so such a term can not appear and the soft behavior of the one - loop all - plus amplitudes is identical to that of the tree amplitudes , @xmath69 more generally , for any helicity configuration one can show that @xmath70 has no loop corrections to all orders of perturbation theory ; this will be discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    for the one - loop ansatz",

    "here @xmath83 is the sum of the massless momenta in the set @xmath52 , @xmath84 .",
    "we refer to @xmath73 as a ` half - soft ' function , because it satisfies @xmath85 where the half - soft factor @xmath86 is analogous to the full soft factor  ( [ gravtreesoftfactor ] ) , but its sum is restricted to the set @xmath52 .",

    "the half - soft functions also solve a recursion relation  @xcite , @xmath91 where the sum is over ` distinct nontrivial partitions ' of @xmath92 into two subsets : @xmath52 and @xmath93 must both be non - empty , and @xmath94 is not distinct from @xmath95 .",

    "one may therefore numerically separate the terms with phase singularities , by evaluating the amplitude for @xmath154 and @xmath155 almost collinear , and subtracting the same expression but with the two collinear momenta rotated by a large angle about @xmath156 ; the non - universal terms will then cancel .",

    "although the analytic requirements that we have imposed on the amplitudes should be sufficiently stringent to uniquely fix them , it would still be useful to have a complete proof that the expression  ( [ allplussimple ] ) is correct .",
