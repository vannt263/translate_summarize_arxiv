    "in recent years there is an increasing interest in using continuous variable ( cv ) systems in applications of quantum information processing , communication and computation @xcite .",
    "the realization of quantum information processing tasks depends on the generation and manipulation of nonclassical entangled states of cv systems .",
    "a full characterization of the nonclassical properties of entangled states of cv systems exists , at present , only for the class of gaussian states . in this special case there exist necessary and sufficient criteria of entanglement @xcite and quantitative entanglement measures @xcite . in quantum information theory of cv systems , gaussian states , in particular two - mode gaussian states , play a key role since they can be easily created and controlled experimentally .",
    "implementation of quantum communication and computation encounters the difficulty that any realistic quantum system can not be isolated and it always has to interact with its environment . quantum coherence and entanglement of quantum systems",
    "are inevitably influenced during their interaction with the external environment . as a result of the irreversible and uncontrollable phenomenon of quantum decoherence ,",
    "the purity and entanglement of quantum states are in most cases degraded .",
    "practically , compared with the discrete variable entangled states , the cv entangled states may be more efficient because they are less affected by decoherence .",
    "due to the unavoidable interaction with the environment , any pure quantum state evolves into a mixed state and to describe realistically cv quantum information processes it is necessary to take decoherence and dissipation into consideration .",
    "decoherence and dynamics of quantum entanglement in cv open systems have been intensively studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "when two systems are immersed in an environment , then , in addition to and at the same time with the quantum decoherence phenomenon , the environment can also generate a quantum entanglement of the two systems and therefore an additional mechanism to correlate them @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study , in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the dynamics of the cv entanglement of two uncoupled modes ( two uncoupled harmonic oscillators ) interacting with a common thermal environment .",
    "the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the quantum dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state .",
    "we have studied previously @xcite the evolution of the entanglement of two identical harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment , characterized by general diffusion and dissipation coefficients .",
    "we obtained that , depending on the values of these coefficients , the state keeps for all times its initial type : separable or entangled . in other cases , entanglement generation , entanglement sudden death or a periodic collapse and revival of entanglement take place .",

    "2 we write the markovian master equation in the heisenberg representation for two uncoupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment and the evolution equation for the covariance matrix . for this equation",
    "we give its general solution , i.e. we derive the variances and covariances of coordinates and momenta corresponding to a generic two - mode gaussian state . by using the peres - simon necessary and sufficient condition for separability of two - mode gaussian states",

    "3 the dynamics of entanglement for the considered subsystem .",
    "we show that for all values of the temperature of the thermal reservoir , an initial separable gaussian state remains separable for all times . in the case of an entangled initial gaussian state , entanglement suppression ( entanglement sudden death )",
    "takes place , for non - zero temperatures of the environment . only for a zero temperature of the thermal bath the initial entangled state",
    "remains entangled for all finite times , but in the limit of infinite time it evolves asymptotically to an equilibrium state which is always separable .",
    "we analyze also the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity , which characterizes the degree of entanglement of the quantum state . a summary is given in sec .",
    "we study the dynamics of the subsystem composed of two non - interacting oscillators in weak interaction with a thermal environment . in the axiomatic formalism based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the irreversible time evolution of an open system",
    "is described by the following general quantum markovian master equation for an operator @xmath0 in the heisenberg representation ( @xmath1 denotes hermitian conjugation ) @xcite : @xmath2+{1\\over 2\\hbar}\\sum_j(v_j^{\\dagger}[a , v_j]+[v_j^{\\dagger},a]v_j).\\label{masteq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 denotes the hamiltonian of the open system and the operators @xmath4 defined on the hilbert space of @xmath5 represent the interaction of the open system with the environment .",
    "we are interested in the set of gaussian states , therefore we introduce such quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve this set during time evolution of the system and in this case our model represents a gaussian noise channel . consequently @xmath3 is taken to be a polynomial of second degree in the coordinates @xmath6 and momenta @xmath7 of the two quantum oscillators and @xmath8 are taken polynomials of first degree in these canonical observables .",

    "the signature of this non - physicality , and thus of quantum entanglement , is the appearance of a negative eigenvalue in the eigenspectrum of the partially transposed density matrix of a bipartite system .",
