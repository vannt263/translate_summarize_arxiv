    "quantum mechanics has opened up new possibilities for representing the bit states making use of quantum mechanical states , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 along with their superpositions .",
    "this brings computational theory to a new horizon , since new algorithms have proved to be able to solve problems that are believed to be unsolvable classically @xcite . at the same time , it has also revolutionized information theory in that new communication protocols can reach unprecedented security level that is classically impossible [  ] .    in standard approaches to quantum",
    "computing and quantum information processing , one adopts two orthogonal basis states , denoted @xmath2 and @xmath3 to encode the logical states of the quantum bits ( qubits ) , which can be two orthogonal spin states of electrons or nuclear moments , or two orthogonal polarization states of single photons @xcite . in recent years , however , there has been a rapid growth of interest in an alternative approach which encodes quantum information using continuous ( quantum ) variables @xcite . since",
    "unconditional quantum operations can be achieved in this scheme , it has the merit of significantly reducing the resource overhead for quantum information processing ( though with non - ideal fidelities ) . for optical implementations , the continuous - variable approach has the additional advantage of experimental accessibility @xcite .",
    "typically , in optical implementations the quantum information is encoded using the quadrature variables ( for instance , the  position \" and the  momentum \" operators ) of the electromagnetic fields which have continuous spectra .",
    "the experimental detections of the quantum states can then be achieved using homodyne detections with high efficiency and accuracy . moreover , various quantum optical techniques are available for quantum state manipulations necessary for gate operations .    along with these developments , jeong and kim @xcite , and ralph _ et al . _",
    "@xcite propose to encode the logical states of qubits using two coherent states with unequal amplitudes , for example , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are coherent states with ( complex ) amplitudes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , respectively , for an optical mode .",
    "the coherent states are defined as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the annihilation operator for the optical mode , and @xmath10 the number state with @xmath11 photons , so that @xmath0 represents the vacuum state .",
    "although coherent states with finite amplitudes are not exactly orthogonal to each other ( thus causing errors in quantum computing tasks and reduced fidelity in quantum information processing ) , the coherent - state approach has several advantages . among them , due to the continuous spectra of coherent states , this scheme is thus a  hybrid \" of the discrete - variable and the continuous - variable approaches .",
    "it therefore inherits merits from both approaches , so that unconditional single - qubit gate operations can be implemented via offline resource states , linear optical networks , photon counting , and classical feedforward @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that based on this scheme efficient quantum gates can be implemented @xcite and fault - tolerant quantum computation can be achieved with experimentally accessible amplitudes for the coherent states @xcite . at the same time , quantum error - correcting codes have also been developed for the coherent - state logic [  ] .",
    "experimentally , the resource states for this scheme ( the  cat states \" ) can be generated using photon subtractions [  ] , making the scheme a promising candidate for realistic quantum computing and quantum information processing .    as with other realizations for quantum computing and quantum information processing , coherent - state qubits are inevitably exposed to environment noises . for instance ,",
    "when an optical coherent - state passes through an optical element ( e.g. , a beam splitter ) that is part of a quantum gate , photon loss can occur due to finite absorption coefficient of the element . in any realistic analysis , it is therefore essential to take into account such effects .",
    "earlier works in this regard have primarily focused on the limit of weak qubit - environment interactions and/or negligible environment - noise coherence time compared with the time scale for the qubit dynamics , so that the born - markov approximation can be invoked @xcite . in recent years , however , it has been recognized that such considerations are not satisfactory for most realistic conditions . in particular , for full scale quantum computing it may be necessary to integrate optical systems with , for instance , solid - state systems @xcite . at the interface between these systems , more complicated decoherence mechanisms may arise compared with those in all - optical settings .",
    "the study of non - markovian dynamics for open quantum systems has therefore become a key issue [  ] . in the present work",
    ", we aim to study the exact open - system dynamics for coherent - state qubits making use of a formulation based on coherent - state path integrals developed by zhang and collaborators [  ] .",
    "this formulation will allow us to study non - perturbatively the dynamics of coherent - state qubits in the presence of strong environment noise .",
    "in particular , we will consider a noisy quantum channel , which consists of two entangled qubits that are interacting with their local environments , and examine the time evolution of its entanglement and teleportation fidelity .",
    "surprisingly , we find that at strong coupling , due to feedback effects from the environment noise , it is possible to preserve at long time the entanglement of the two qubits and achieve better - than - classical teleportation fidelity if an appropriate error - correcting code is applied .",
    "this demonstrates that it is feasible to establish a robust coherent - state quantum channel even in the presence of environment noise .",
    "we will start in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] by introducing a model for dissipation which allows exact solutions via coherent - state path integral formulation .",
    "we will then examine the exact dynamics of a single coherent - state qubit subject to such environment noise . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2qb ] the analysis will be extended to two entangled qubits that constitute a quantum channel .",
    "we will look into the time evolution of the entanglement and teleportation fidelity of the quantum channel in the presence of dissipation . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : ec ] we will study how error - correcting codes can help recover the entanglement and teleportation fidelity of the pair of coherent - state qubits at long time . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : fin ] we summarize our findings and offer brief discussions over related issues .",
    "to study decoherence of the coherent - state qubits , let us suppose the optical mode ( henceforth the  cs mode \" ) adopted for coherent - state encoding undergoes dissipation due to photon loss to its environment .",
    "this dissipation has previously been modeled with a beam splitter which deflects photons from the cs mode into an environment mode @xcite .",
    "since the dissipation is characterized solely by the transmissivity of the beam splitter , it has no dynamics in this simple model @xcite .",
    "although one could phenomenologically ascribe an exponentially decaying time - dependence to the transmissivity , the dynamics would invariably be markovian for which no memory effect from the environment coupling can arise @xcite . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "let us consider a generic model in which the cs mode interacts with an environment that consists of a collection of simple harmonic oscillator modes .",
    "the total hamiltonian thus reads ( we set @xmath12 throughout ) @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cs mode frequency and @xmath9 the corresponding annihilation operator , @xmath15 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath16-th environment mode with frequency @xmath17 , which is coupled to the cs mode with amplitude @xmath18 . in this model , the cs mode exchanges energy with each environment mode through a beam - splitter interaction hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "these environment modes can correspond to , for instance , phonon modes in a solid or other photon modes .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) therefore provides a generic model for photon loss which may be relevant for interfacing between optical and solid - state systems , for instance in integrated quantum optical circuits @xcite . in the limit of weak coupling",
    ", it reduces to a beam - splitter model with transmissivity that decays exponentially with time ( see later in this section ) @xcite . for general coupling ,",
    "this generic model can exhibit richer dynamics than that of the beam - splitter model , as we will see in the following @xcite .",
    "in particular , memory effects due to environment feedback at strong coupling can lead to novel dynamics for the coherent - state qubits .    in the context of",
    "damped harmonic oscillators , the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) has previously been studied under the born - markov approximation @xcite . in order to examine feedback effects from the environment noise , it is necessary to go beyond this limit .",
    "this has been achieved by zhang and coworkers [  ] using coherent - state path integrals applied to the feynman - vernon influence functional formalism @xcite .",
    "in essence , one starts from the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath19 for the total system ( including the cs mode and the environment ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the initial time and the hamiltonian @xmath22 is given by ( [ h ] ) . in the coherent - state representation , one has the completeness relation @xcite @xmath23 where the integral extends over the entire complex @xmath6-plane and @xmath24 with re , i m indicating the real and imaginary parts , respectively ; the coherent state @xmath25 are defined earlier in ( [ cs ] ) , and @xmath26 is the identity operator . utilizing ( [ completeness ] ) , one can express ( [ rho_tot ] ) in terms of coherent - state basis for the cs mode and the environment modes . by integrating out all environment degrees of freedom , one",
    "can then arrive at an effective equation for the time evolution of the cs mode which is encoded with the full environment effects .",
    "let us suppose the cs mode and the environment modes are completely decoupled initially , and the environment starts off in the vacuum state at zero temperature .",
    "the initial total density matrix is thus @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the initial density matrix for the cs mode and @xmath29 denotes vacuum state for the environment modes . using ( [ rho_tot_t0 ] ) in ( [ rho_tot ] ) and tracing out all environment modes in the coherent - state basis , one can derive a path - integral representation for the time evolution of the reduced density matrix for the cs mode @xcite . expressing the reduced density matrix for the cs mode at time @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath6 and @xmath33 , one finds in the influence functional formulation the time evolution for the matrix elements of the reduced density matrix @xmath34 where the kernel @xmath35 now incorporates the entire environment effects in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "the kernel is given by @xcite @xmath36 with @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 follows the equation of motion @xmath39 subject to the initial condition @xmath40 .",
    "as we will notice in the following , @xmath38 plays an essential role in the dynamics of coherent - state qubits . in ( [ ut_eom ] )",
    "we have introduced the noise correlation function @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the spectral function for the cs mode - environment coupling in ( [ h ] ) @xmath43 namely it is the density of the environment modes weighted with the modulus square of the coupling amplitude . for explicit calculations of the problem",
    ", one must have an explicit expression for the spectral function .",
    "we will defer such calculations to later and focus for the moment on establishing general formulations for the problems that will concern us .",
    "let us now apply the formulation above to study the decoherence dynamics of a single coherent - state qubit . in the coherent - state encoding , the initial density matrix for a single qubit has the general form @xmath44 where @xmath45 are time - independent coefficients and @xmath46 take values at the encoding amplitudes . throughout this work we will adopt coherent states with opposite phases as the encoding basis .",
    "therefore , for instance , with the encoding basis @xmath47 , one would have in the equation above @xmath48 . from ( [ rho_general ] ) ,",
    "it is clear that the time evolution of the density matrix is entirely delegated to the elements @xmath49 .",
    "our first task is therefore to work out the time evolution of such an element .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary element @xmath50 . in the coherent - state representation ,",
    "its matrix elements are @xmath51 the time evolution of the matrix element ( [ ab_mx ] ) can be found using ( [ rho_red ] ) , with @xmath52 here in place of the reduced density matrix @xmath53 .",
    "the integrals over @xmath54 and @xmath55 are gaussian integrals which can be dealt with easily and yield @xmath56 substituting ( [ ab_t ] ) back into ( [ rho_t ] ) and , as above , replacing @xmath53 with @xmath52 , one can carry out the integrals over @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and arrive at the following prescription for the exact dynamics for the element @xmath59 in the presence of environment noise @xmath60 where the arrow indicates time evolution . equipped with ( [ elm ] ) , we are now able to find the exact time evolution for a coherent - state qubit with any initial density matrix",
    ". we will therefore refer to this result repeatedly in the rest of this paper .",
    "as an example , let us consider a coherent - state qubit initially in the  cat state \" in the basis @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a normalization factor ( note that it depends on @xmath65 , @xmath66 and thus can not be absorbed into them ) . following the prescription ( [ elm ] ) , the time evolution of the state ( [ cat ] ) subject to dissipations due to the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be obtained easily @xmath67 \\ , .",
    "\\label{rho_t_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , for brevity here we have denoted @xmath68 which will also be used in the rest of this paper . since the absolute value of @xmath38 turns out to be always less than 1 for @xmath69 , the environment noise thus causes amplitude reduction in the coherent - state qubit @xcite and induces phase damping through the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix . in the limit of weak coupling , or",
    "when the coupling has a broad spectrum , the spectral function @xmath42 would have weak frequency dependence , so that the noise correlation function ( [ gt ] ) becomes a sharp function in time .",
    "taking @xmath70 , one can find from ( [ ut_eom ] ) in this limit @xcite @xmath71 with @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes principal value of the integral .",
    "therefore , in this limit the coherent - state amplitude decays exponentially with time and eq .",
    "( [ rho_t_1 ] ) reduces to the markovian result obtained in ref .  .",
    "for general coupling strength , however , @xmath38 can have quite different time dependence and novel qubit dynamics can emerge , as we will soon discover .",
    "it is interesting to note that the result ( [ rho_t_1 ] ) can be expressed in the form of an operator sum @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the state @xmath77 of ( [ cat ] ) with @xmath47 replaced by @xmath78 ( the factor @xmath79 remains the same ; thus @xmath76 is not normalized ) , and we have introduced the ",

    "it follows immediately from ( [ k_sum ] ) that the dynamical map induced by the environment noise consists of two parts : the mapping of @xmath77 to @xmath76 ( or damping of @xmath83 to @xmath84 ) and the random application of the pauli-@xmath80 operator .",
    "we therefore recognize that the decoherence due to the interaction hamiltonian in ( [ h ] ) has a two - fold effect over the coherent - state qubit @xcite : @xmath85 as we shall find out , this is a crucial observation , since it suggests the appropriate error - correcting code to be employed when one wishes to recover the coherence of the qubit @xcite , which we shall discuss in sec .",

    "more errors can be corrected similarly when more encoding ancilla modes are added . in general ,",
    "an @xmath11-bit encoding in the present scheme can correct up to @xmath152 phase - errors ( @xmath11 must be odd number ) and the probability for an error - free transmission is @xcite @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the probability for one phase - flip error in each mode . note that when @xmath155 , the success probability @xmath156 can be made arbitrarily close to 1 with sufficiently large @xmath11 .    to incorporate the error - correcting scheme above into our calculation for the exact dynamics of the noisy quantum channel ( [ rho_t_ctecs ] ) ,",
    "we note that the probability @xmath154 for phase - flip errors in our calculation is given by that in ( [ k_sum ] ) .",
    "thus , according to ( [ ps ] ) , with an @xmath11-bit error - correcting code implemented the error probability becomes @xmath157 .",
    "this corresponds to changing the previously defined @xmath158 in ( [ rho_t_ctecs ] ) into @xmath159 the time evolution for the concurrence and the fully entangled fraction for the error - corrected noisy quantum channel can now be obtained from ( [ conc ] ) and ( [ fmax ] ) by simply replacing @xmath158 with @xmath160 above .",

    "one can notice immediately that at weak coupling the concurrence for all three cases have now attained longer life spans , and the teleportation fidelity can go above the classical limit after error correction is applied .",
    "these gains , however , do not seem to be very impressive as even with a 101-bit encoding , the enhancement in the teleportation fidelity is still rather limited ( @xmath161 at large time for all three cases )",
    ". such limited gain at so high cost does not seem practical .    at strong coupling",
    ", however , the situation turns out quite different .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : pf : ctft05 ] that in this case , error correction can improve the concurrence and the teleportation fidelity quite significantly . for super - ohmic coupling , with",
    "3-bit encoding the noisy channel can maintain a non - zero concurrence ( @xmath162 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : pf : ctft05](c ) ) and a better than classical teleportation fidelity ( @xmath163 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : pf : ctft05](f ) ) at long time . with 9-bit encoding ,",
    "we find that the concurrence for all three classes of spectral functions attain finite steady values and the teleportation fidelity are all raised above the classical value at long time . in the limit of large @xmath11 encoding ( illustrated with @xmath164 here ) , even for the sub - ohmic case ( which would induce the strongest environment coupling due to its small detunning ) , the concurrence can be recovered to 0.796 , and the teleportation fidelity to 0.958 .",
    "therefore , at strong coupling , the phase - flip error - correcting code can recover the noisy channel significantly and result in a robust quantum channel at long time .    to understand the results above ,",
    "let us recall from ( [ effects ] ) the two effects ( a ) amplitude reduction , and ( b ) random phase - errors due to the environment noise . as noted above , for error probability @xmath165 the present error - correcting code can correct phase - flip errors very efficiently . for coherent - state qubits , from ( [ k_sum ] ) , since @xmath165 always , the error - correcting code can protect the noisy channel against effect ( b ) very well .",
    "the difference between the weak - coupling and the strong - coupling results , therefore , is primarily due to effect ( a ) . at weak coupling , since @xmath140 decays with time monotonically to zero ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ut](a ) ) , effect ( a ) persists all the way until the qubit is completely damped away . at strong coupling",
    ", however , @xmath140 saturates at long time and thus effect ( a ) is entirely removed when this steady is reached .",
    "therefore , for strong coupling , when the phase - flip error - correcting code is implemented , both effects from the environment noise can be accounted for and a robust quantum channel can persist at long time .      in the preceding subsection , we have seen that when @xmath38 becomes non - dissipative in the long - time limit , applying phase - flip error - correcting code can help preserve the quantum channel . as a comparison , here we shall consider a different encoding scheme for coherent - state qubits . in ref .",

    "following ref .  , an @xmath11-bit encoding in this scheme yields for the state ( [ ctecs ] ) @xmath166 where the normalization factor @xmath167 and as in ( [ ctecs ] ) @xmath88 ; here @xmath168 etc denote direct products of @xmath11 coherent states . since each basis state @xmath169",

    "figure [ fig : bf : ctft05 ] illustrates our results for the above calculations with the cs mode frequency @xmath146 and initial amplitude @xmath145 at strong coupling ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the bit - flip encoding turns out to further degrade the quantum channel .",
    "with increasing bit redundancy in the encoding , the concurrence tends to have shorter life spans and the teleportation fidelity drops further below the classical value , despite the non - decaying @xmath38 at long time .",
    "the bit - flip encoding here thus not only would not help recover the quantum channel , but would actually further disrupt it .    in order to see the reason for",
    "the deterioration caused by bit - flip encoding , let us apply this encoding to the cat state ( [ cat ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath181 where @xmath182 . using the prescription ( [ elm_n ] ) for the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath183 and expressing the result as an operator sum similar to ( [ k_sum ] )",
    ", one finds the phase - error probability after the bit - flip encoding becomes @xmath184 it is then clear that with increasing bit redundancy @xmath11 in the encoding , the phase error actually increases . in other words ,",
    "the bit - flip encoding would in fact enhance effect ( b ) in ( [ effects ] ) for coherent - state qubits .",
    "therefore , instead of reducing environment noises , the bit - flip encoding induces additional sources for phase errors , which further corrupt the noisy channel .",
    "in summary , we have studied the exact dynamics of optical coherent - state qubits when they are exposed to environment noises .",
    "the environment is modeled with a collection of simple harmonic oscillators which interact with the qubit by exchanging energies . making use of a coherent - state path integral formulation for this model @xcite",
    ", we are able to study non - perturbatively feedback effects on the qubit dynamics due to strong environment coupling . in particular , we examine the dynamics of a noisy quantum channel that consists of two entangled qubits which are coupled independently to their local environments . due to feedback from the qubit - environment interaction at strong coupling ,",
    "the time evolution of the qubit can become non - dissipative at long time .",
    "we study the concurrence and teleportation fidelity of the noisy channel and show that , by incorporating a phase - flip error - correcting code , a robust quantum channel can be achieved when the qubit - environment interaction is strong . as a comparison",
    ", we also consider a bit - flip encoding scheme , which turns out to further degrade the noisy channel .",
    "in addition to demonstrating an approach for studying the exact dynamics of coherent - state qubits subject to environment noise , a key finding of this work is the possibility for achieving a robust quantum channel despite strong qubit - environment interactions .",
    "this relies not only on applying appropriate error - correcting code , but also occurrence of the non - dissipative dynamics of @xmath38 at long time , which depends strongly on the structure of the spectral function @xcite .",
    "for instance , for a lorentzian spectral function , @xmath38 would not exhibit non - dissipative dynamics in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case even when phase - flip error - correcting code is implemented for the noisy channel , its concurrence can not have a non - zero steady value , and its teleportation fidelity always stays below the classical value at long time @xcite .",
    "although the robust quantum channel discovered in this paper has been demonstrated for a specific initial state ( [ ctecs ] ) , we believe that the result should be fairly general .",
    "this is because the robust quantum channel would emerge as long as one can deal with both amplitude reduction and phase errors due to the environment noise properly .",
    "since the dynamics of @xmath38 depends solely on the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , and not on the initial state , whenever @xmath38 attains non - zero steady value at long time , amplitude reduction would cease to exist . for phase errors , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : pfc ] , the phase - flip error - correcting code can work efficiently since the error probability @xmath154 here is always less than 1/2 , irrespective of the initial state .",
    "therefore , a robust quantum channel can survive in the long - time limit for any initially entangled states for suitably chosen parameters ( e.g.  the coupling strength ) .",
    "of course , the quality of the quantum channel would certainly depend on the specific initial state , the essence of our conclusions should remain valid in general .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that it would be interesting to try to understand the deeper reason underlying the emergence of the robust quantum channel .",
    "for instance , can we understand it in terms of the interplay between different dynamical maps ? and",
    "if so , can we extend these results to more general settings ?",
