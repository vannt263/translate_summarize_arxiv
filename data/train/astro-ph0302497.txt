    "this work is motivated by the wealth of recent observational discoveries of the strong morphological , chemical , and dynamical evolution of galaxies in clusters .",
    "transformations of luminous galaxies , the existence of separate massive dark objects , and the evolution of cluster substructure intensify the need for theoretical understanding .",
    "several different phenomena have been proposed as the `` likely '' explanation ( see  [ sec : scenarios ] ) .",
    "while all of them take place in one form or another , it has eluded our understanding which process is primarily responsible for the evolution .",
    "i argue that tidal interactions with neighboring galaxies and with the dark cluster halo are the favored scenario .",
    "tides operate even before the cluster dynamically relaxes and affect both stars and gas in the infalling galaxies .",
    "tidal effects add enough random motion to transform thin galactic disks into the kinematically hot thick - disk configurations characteristic of s0 galaxies .",
    "tidal disruption of low density galaxies may provide a large fraction of the diffuse intracluster light .",
    "the relative importance of tides depends on the cosmological context . in an @xmath5 universe ,",
    "gravitating structures assemble late and the tidal effects are only now starting to play a role in shaping the galaxies , whereas in an open universe , @xmath6 , galaxies have formed early and experienced a substantial metamorphosis .",
    "the currently fashionable model , a flat universe with @xmath7 and a cosmological constant , provides the intermediate case . in order to incorporate these effects into the galactic dynamics self - consistently ,",
    "i perform numerical simulations of the evolution of a medium - size cluster of galaxies in the three cosmologies .",
    "the choice of a numerical scheme is very important here , as the required dynamical range of simulation is huge : from hundred parsecs to model the galactic dynamics to tens of mpc to derive the cluster tidal field correctly . in order to achieve such a range with the existing codes ,",
    "i introduce a new scheme of separating the cluster tidal field from the galactic model .",
    "first , i run a lower resolution cosmological simulation that captures the details of cluster formation and its time - varying potential . at some early redshift , @xmath8",
    ", i identify the probable galactic halos and follow their trajectories until the present . along each trajectory , i calculate and store the components of the tidal shear tensor .",
    "then , i resimulate individual galaxies with a very high resolution applying the cluster tidal field as an external perturbation . the results of the stellar dynamical galaxy simulations are presented in a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "no single simulation of a cluster of galaxies (  [ sec : prev ] ) has been able to achieve comparable resolution on the galactic scale .",
    "i describe a careful procedure to extract the tidal field from the grid pm simulation .",
    "because of the particle noise , it is necessary to apply a smoothing filter extending over a range of several grid cells . also , large halos contribute significantly to the tidal field around their centers .",
    "since we are interested only in the external tidal force on the galaxy , this self - contribution needs to be removed .",
    "special care is taken to evaluate the contribution of the galactic particles and subtract it from the total tidal tensor .    also , the resulting tidal field depends on the correct calculation of the galactic trajectories .",
    "i use two independent methods to follow the trajectories : in one , the galactic centers of mass are assumed to be test particles following the overall cluster potential ; in the other , the center of mass is calculated using the densest subset of particles constituting an actual halo .",
    "the sampling of halos at each time step provides an excellent time resolution of the tidal field , of order @xmath9 yr .",
    "finally , the distribution of halos and their relative velocities enable us to estimate the contribution of close encounters to the external tidal force .",
    "in  [ sec : scenarios ] , i review the present observational status of galaxies in clusters at various redshifts and the theoretical mechanisms connecting pieces of the puzzle . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] , i describe the numerical method used to simulate the self - consistent evolution of the three clusters starting with the primordial fluctuations . in  [ sec : galaxies ] , i identify the galactic halos and calculate their trajectories . in  [ sec : gal_distr ] , i study the possible mergers and close encounters between galaxies , including the effects of halo clustering . finally in ",
    "[ sec : tidal ] , i calculate the tidal field along the galaxy trajectories and use it in  [ sec : heating ] to estimate the amount of tidal heating of galaxies .",
    "the idea that the environment plays a role in the evolution of galaxies has been recognized long ago .",
    "@xcite suggested that collisions between galaxies might be responsible for transforming spirals into the gas - free s0s .",
    "@xcite advocated a merger of two spirals to produce an elliptical .",
    "@xcite argued for the truncation of dark matter halos of galaxies by the tidal field of the cluster .",
    "@xcite proposed the stripping of gas by the ram pressure of the intracluster medium .",
    "finally , @xcite and most recently moore at al .",
    "( 1998,1999 ) considered tidal interactions between the galaxies and the dense cluster core and between the galaxies themselves .",
    "i review the observational picture and then discuss briefly the pros and cons of each of these scenarios .",
    "the hubble space telescope has been instrumental in shaping our current understanding of distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "the unique resolving power of the hst brings us exquisite details of the distorted profiles of the otherwise normal disk galaxies .",
    "strongly depleted in nearby clusters , spirals make up to 50% of the galaxies in clusters at redshift @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these results are similar to the @xcite effect , an abundance of blue irregular galaxies at an intermediate redshift .",
    "spectroscopic evidence @xcite suggests bursts of recent , or even current , star formation .",
    "this picture is drastically different from the rich present - day clusters , populated mostly by featureless elliptical or s0 galaxies which follow the local morphology - density relation @xcite .",
    "it is well established now that a strong chemical and morphological evolution has taken place in clusters of galaxies .",
    "what are the options ? did the @xmath11 spirals become the @xmath12 ellipticals ? on the contrary ,",
    "the hst data show that the fraction of elliptical galaxies _ increases _ with redshift , although not as strongly as that of spirals . both of these effects occur at the expense of s0s .",
    "their population is depleted by a factor of two or three at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that star formation has ceased in the ellipticals by @xmath13 , but continued in the s0s at least until @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the ellipticals must have exhausted their supply of fresh gas at an earlier time , as indicated also by their very high central densities @xcite .    even at low redshift",
    "the situation is far from being smooth @xcite .",
    "new ground - based imaging of the coma and five other nearby clusters reveals a variety of distorted , tailed , `` line '' , and dwarf galaxies .",
    "these are indicators of the ongoing dynamical evolution .",
    "many galaxies are disturbed and some show blue colors .",
    "also , individual groups of dwarf galaxies have been found in coma .",
    "these results were not expected for the smooth and regular clusters .",
    "a new observational puzzle has been presented by the discovery of massive dark objects in the cluster cl 0024 + 1654 , through the technique of image reconstruction of gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the dark objects are not associated with any of the luminous galaxies in the cluster and may contain as much mass as @xmath15 .",
    "one of the possible explanations is that these objects are just `` failed '' galaxies , in which gaseous dissipation was insufficient to form stars .",
    "alternatively , they can be stripped dark matter halos of other galaxies . analytical arguments and previous studies (  [ sec : striphalos ] ) suggest that extended galactic halos may be effectively swept away by the tidal field of the cluster .      collisions of galaxies are assisted by the dense environment of the cluster .",
    "however , in a virialized cluster , galaxies move with the relative velocities of the order 1000 km s@xmath16 and even on a head - on trajectory will pass through each other without doing much harm to the stellar disks .",
    "the gas can be shocked and stripped away in such a collision @xcite , which would leave two gas - free galaxies . but",
    "a simple estimate argues that close encounters are very infrequent ( however see  [ sec : gal_distr ] and appendix [ sec : app_merger ] ) .",
    "consider a virialized cluster of galaxies with a one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath17 km s@xmath16 and a virial radius @xmath18 mpc .",
    "assuming that the cluster contains @xmath19 galaxies uniformly distributed inside this radius , the number of close encounters a given galaxy of size @xmath20 kpc will experience in a hubble time ( @xmath21 yr ) is @xmath22 here i have neglected gravitational focusing and assumed the relative velocity to be @xmath23 .",
    "thus a galaxy is expected to encounter one other galaxy over the course of its evolution .",
    "however , the probability of a merger of two galaxies is much smaller : @xmath24 for the galactic velocity dispersion @xmath25 . here",
    ", three powers of @xmath26 come from the phase space density and another power of @xmath26 comes from the limitation of the velocity that leads to a merger @xcite .",
    "also , ellipticals usually have much higher central densities than spiral galaxies .",
    "so if two spirals merge , it seems hard to close the gap in density without strong dissipation @xcite .",
    "as jim gunn once said @xcite , `` i do not think you can make rocks by merging clouds . ''",
    "thus the merger scenario appears unlikely to dominate the dynamics of galaxies , although mergers could be important for the formation of the central giant cd galaxy @xcite and the ultraluminous infrared galaxies and agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others , have investigated the truncation of dark galactic halos by the tidal field of the cluster . in the simplest case , where both the cluster and the galaxy halos have singular isothermal distributions , the tidal radius is approximately @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance of closest approach to the center of the cluster .",
    "real clusters are not perfectly smooth .",
    "any substructure left after the hierarchical formation of the cluster will amplify the truncation effect .",
    "it is expected to control the amount of dark matter , and therefore , the mass of the galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", tidal truncation should not significantly affect the dynamics of the galactic disks which are much more compact .",
    "morphological evolution of luminous galaxies must be due to something else .",
    "@xcite argued that the ram pressure of the intracluster medium ( icm ) might sweep away gas from the galactic disks .",
    "x - ray observations show the presence of a significant amount of hot gas at the virial temperature , contributing as much as 10% of the total cluster mass .",
    "while the stars move freely through this media , the gas is subject to the ram pressure @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the density of the icm and @xmath31 is the velocity of the galaxy . in order to strip the gas",
    ", the ram pressure should exceed the restoring gravitational force per unit area of the disk : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface density of the stars , and @xmath34 is the surface density of the gas . for example , if the gas with an average density 1 @xmath35 is distributed over a scale height of 100 pc and the stellar density is typical of the solar neighborhood , @xmath36 pc@xmath37 , the icm needs to be as dense as @xmath38 @xmath35 . such densities are observed in the cores of rich clusters , and numerical experiments @xcite show that a typical spiral there may lose most of its atomic gas .",
    "spiral galaxies in clusters have long been known to be deficient of atomic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "these `` anemic '' galaxies @xcite have normal molecular hydrogen abundances but lack the atomic component in the outer parts of their disks .",
    "since the h@xmath39 gas resides in dense molecular clouds , it is more able to withstand the external pressure ; on the other hand , the  gas is usually distributed much more smoothly at lower densities and is susceptible to the ram pressure stripping . but @xcite noticed an interesting feature in three rich abell clusters and the virgo cluster : the  deficiency is stronger for larger galaxies . since bigger spirals ( excluding the lsbs ) usually have a higher surface density , they should be able to protect their gaseous component better .",
    "the observed trend is the opposite .",
    "having considered various possible mechanisms of gas removal , valluri and jog conclude that the  deficiency can only be explained by tidal interactions .",
    "tides _ are _ a critical factor of the cluster environment .",
    "tidal effects depend on relative sizes of the system and the perturber .",
    "consider stellar systems from smallest to largest scales : stars are @xmath40 times smaller than star clusters and experience almost no tidal effects ( except in close binaries ) .",
    "star clusters are @xmath41 times smaller than galaxies and experience significant tidal effects , which however operate on a long time scale @xcite .",
    "in contrast , galaxies are just 30 to 100 times smaller than clusters of galaxies .",
    "there tidal effects ought to be important !",
    "semi - analytic models of galactic encounters @xcite predict the segregation of galaxies by mass and the formation of a central cd galaxy .",
    "the giant cd grows by swallowing other massive galaxies in a process that widens the gap between the first and the second ranking galaxies @xcite .",
    "mass segregation in clusters is also supported by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite confirmed that the central galaxy , rising by mergers of its neighbors , follows a de vaucouleurs profile and would be classified as a giant elliptical .",
    "restricted numerical simulations of @xcite and @xcite show that tidal compression by the cluster halo produces spiral arms and tidal tails in some of the representative models of disk galaxies .",
    "more recently , moore at al .",
    "( 1996b,1998 ) simulated the dynamics of galaxies in a fixed , isothermal cluster .",
    "they found that fast close encounters with massive galaxies tend to destroy many dwarfs , and even large galaxies lose their thin disks .",
    "so the spiral galaxies are essentially transformed into the ellipticals or dwarf spheroidals .",
    "however , the potential of a real cluster grows in time , which leads to two competing effects : ( 1 ) galaxies enter the cluster at a later epoch and have less time to interact ( depending on cosmological model ) , and ( 2 ) the time - varying cluster potential gives rise to large - scale perturbations in the tidal field and causes tidal shocks comparable to those from massive galaxies .",
    "new simulations by @xcite include the hierarchical cluster formation and show weaker evolution of galaxies . whether the galaxy  galaxy or the cluster ",
    "galaxy interactions dominate has not yet been understood .",
    "similar tidal effects operate on smaller scale in the local group and may lead to the morphological evolution of the dwarf satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "i use a particle - mesh code @xcite to simulate the formation and evolution of three clusters of galaxies in the critical ( @xmath1 ) , open ( @xmath2 ) , and flat ( @xmath42 ) cosmological models described in table [ tab : cosmo ] .",
    "the code solves poisson s equation using fft on a rectangular grid and evaluates the density field using the cloud - in - cell ( cic ) method .",
    "the code runs fast in parallel , allowing a large simulation with @xmath43 particles distributed on a @xmath44 grid .",
    "some of the pm results have been tested with the adaptive mesh refinement code @xcite .",
    "specifically , i checked galaxy trajectories and the calculation of the tidal force .",
    "the comoving size of the simulation box is @xmath45 mpc and the grid cell size is @xmath46 kpc .",
    "this is a compromise between the desire to reach a reasonably high resolution in the cluster center and the need to have enough computational volume to include late infall .",
    "the latter is important because a very strong initial density perturbation may lead to more mass being bound to the cluster than is available in the whole box , @xmath47 , causing the cluster to `` under - form '' .",
    "tests with different amplitudes of the power spectrum , @xmath48 , show that the dark matter velocity dispersion artificially saturates for @xmath49 in the low @xmath4 models .",
    "therefore , i adopt @xmath50 for these models , in rough agreement with the relation derived from the comparison of large scale -body simulations with the all - sky survey of x - ray clusters , @xmath51 @xcite",
    ". then the virial mass of the simulated clusters is about @xmath52 , or 7% of the total mass within the computational box .",
    "the actual amount of mass bound to the clusters may be a factor of 23 higher , up to 20% of the total mass . in the critical density model , the normalization @xmath53",
    "is chosen such that the cluster velocity dispersion is the same as in the other two models .",
    "the simulations start at redshift @xmath54 .",
    "the time step is determined by the requirement that no particle crosses more than a half of the grid cell , @xmath55 .",
    "also , it limits the expansion parameter @xmath56 to grow by no more than @xmath57 .",
    "i have checked that increasing the time step by a factor of two does not change noticeably the structure of the resulting cluster .",
    "the look - back time as a function of redshift ( @xcite , p. 314 ) can be calculated analytically in each of the three models . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the standard result is @xmath58 . for @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath42 , @xmath61 the hubble constant",
    "is assumed to be @xmath62 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 ( @xmath63 ) , according to the time delay measurements in a gravitational lens system 0957 + 561 @xcite and other independent methods @xcite .    on 16 processors of sgi origin 2000 ,",
    "the full simulation with a @xmath44 grid runs for about 36 hours .",
    "a large fraction of the time is spent on the calculation of the tidal field due to and around the identified halos .",
    "all simulations presented in this paper were done using the 64-processor sgi origin 2000 supercomputer at the princeton university observatory .",
    "the cluster simulations use the constrained gaussian random initial conditions , generated using the method of @xcite .",
    "the actual realization is taken from the cluster comparison project of @xcite .",
    "in that work the initial density perturbations were chosen to produce a @xmath64 peak with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath65 mpc . retaining the same random phases from the original realization",
    ", i have renormalized the perturbations according to the power spectrum of the chosen cosmological models .",
    "for each of the three models , i evaluate the power spectrum @xmath66 , including the effects of baryons , using the fitting expressions of @xcite and @xcite . on the cluster and sub - cluster scales ,",
    "the power spectra follow approximately a power law @xmath67 .",
    "then i transform the initial displacements @xmath68 into the fourier space and renormalize their amplitudes according to the new power spectrum : @xmath69 where the old power spectrum , @xmath70 , is from @xcite . both power spectra are normalized to the corresponding value of @xmath71 at the initial redshift @xmath72 .",
    "finally , i transform the perturbation field back to real space and obtain the initial displacements for the dark matter particles .",
    "the parameters of the resulting clusters are given in table [ tab : clusters ] .",
    "the virialized region is taken to be a sphere originating at the cluster center , with a mean overdensity @xmath73 .",
    "the average mass of the clusters is @xmath74 , and the one - dimensional velocity dispersion is 660 km s@xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig : den_z0 ] shows the projected surface density of the three clusters at the present epoch .",
    "the @xmath1 cluster has not yet relaxed and still continues to accrete matter .",
    "note a large infalling group of galaxies to the upper right from the center on the enlarged panel .",
    "in contrast , the two low @xmath4 clusters appear more spherical and regular , and also very similar to each other ; the cosmological constant does not seem to affect the cluster properties .",
    "figure [ fig : clden ] shows that the density profiles of the three clusters are very similar , with a slight excursion of the @xmath1 cluster at @xmath75 mpc due to the infalling group .",
    "this group is clearly visible on the velocity dispersion plot , figure [ fig : cldisp ] .",
    "the decrease of the velocity dispersion at small distances from the center is partly real and partly numerical .",
    "the high resolution dark matter simulations in @xcite show a similar decrease ; therefore our models should exhibit the trend .",
    "also , such a decrease exists in the popular nfw model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "present simulations lack resolution in the cluster core and can not be trusted at small radii . to illustrate the resolution effects , i have repeated the simulations of cluster iii on smaller grids , @xmath43 and @xmath76 cells ( table [ tab : clusters_res ] ) , with the correspondingly fewer particles , @xmath77 .",
    "figure [ fig : clcomp ] shows that the density profile is reproduced well to the resolution limit of each simulation , but the velocity dispersion starts to decline much earlier in the lower resolution runs . nevertheless , the difference between the @xmath44 and the @xmath43 runs is small and confirms the accuracy of the larger simulation .",
    "the simulated clusters are similar to the virgo cluster in size and velocity dispersion .",
    "rosat results @xcite indicate that virgo s x - ray mass is @xmath78 , while the optical velocity dispersion of galaxies is between 581 and 721 km s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these values are quite common for the nearby clusters , as shown by the optical and x - ray survey of @xcite . often cited in theoretical work , the coma cluster is much larger , with the one - dimensional velocity dispersion about 1000 km s@xmath16 @xcite and the virial mass of order @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "our models , therefore , represent modest but more common clusters of galaxies .",
    "their velocity dispersion is characteristic of the abell richness class 1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the definition of a galaxy in the cluster simulation is not trivial . while at high redshift dark matter halos are significantly denser than the surrounding media , at low redshift the density contrast effectively disappears .",
    "this effect is known as overmerging of halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) due to the insufficient mass resolution .",
    "therefore , it is difficult and , to some extent , uncertain to try to identify the galaxy halos from the particle distribution at all times . instead , i have implemented the following simple procedure , which can be extended to a higher degree of sophistication .",
    "i identify the dark matter halos at a time early enough that the density contrast is large , but late enough that galaxies are known to exist .",
    "a fiducial epoch at which the central parts of large galaxies are assumed to have formed is taken to be @xmath8 .    in order to obtain a statistically significant sample , i choose 100 most massive halos identified by the group finding algorithm .",
    "then , i add 100 massless particles to the pm simulation with the coordinates and velocities of the halo centers of mass .",
    "these new `` galactic '' particles do not affect either the density or the potential calculation but rather act as test particles .",
    "i follow the motion of these particles and output the tidal field along their trajectories at each time step .    by not using real particles to calculate galaxy trajectories",
    ", we effectively avoid the overmerging problem : the test particles will not merge even if they come very close to each other .",
    "the drawback is that due to a finite time step the test particles may gradually depart from the bulk of the galactic particles . to guard against this effect ,",
    "i have also implemented another scheme .",
    "the second scheme involves real particles constituting the halo .",
    "i calculate the halo density at each particle s position using the same cic kernel that is used in the main pm calculation .",
    "then i take the densest subset of particles , 1/8 of the total , to calculate the center of mass directly .",
    "these dense particles presumably lie deep in the potential well of the halo and serve as robust indicators of the center . in case of the two galaxies merging , their centers defined this way would clearly indicate it .",
    "however , i do not attempt to resolve the internal structure of galaxies in these simulations and only trace their centers of mass .",
    "dark matter halos are identified using the coordinate - free algorithm hop proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is similar in spirit to denmax @xcite but uses densities at the particle positions instead of the regular grid .",
    "i have extended hop by including a procedure for the removal of particles which are not gravitationally bound to the group .",
    "this procedure , similar to the skid algorithm @xcite , is outlined below .",
    "the gravitational energy of the particles in a group is calculated by direct summation of the plummer potentials with a smoothing length corresponding to one grid cell of the cluster simulation .",
    "the kinetic energy includes the hubble expansion term .",
    "the total energy per unit mass is @xmath80 ^ 2        - \\sum_j { g m_p \\over ( ( { \\mbox{\\bf r}}_i-{\\mbox{\\bf r}}_j)^2 + \\epsilon^2)^{1/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 are the particle mass , physical coordinate , and velocity , respectively , and @xmath84 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath8 .",
    "the index `` com '' refers to the center of mass of the group .",
    "the particles are unbound as follows .",
    "i find particle @xmath85 with the maximum energy and discard it , if @xmath86 .",
    "i recalculate the center of mass using the remaining particles and update the potential energy .",
    "then , i find a new highest energy particle and repeat the procedure . in the end , all remaining particles are bound or else the group is dispersed .    a straightforward implementation of the unbinding procedure works well ,",
    "although somewhat slowly for groups containing more than @xmath41 particles . in the longest case ,",
    "the unbinding algorithm took about 40 minutes on a single sgi r10000 processor .",
    "the second part of the hop algorithm , regroup , uses three different overdensity parameters to define the outer boundary of the group ( @xmath87 ) , the saddle point for merging two groups together ( @xmath88 ) , and the minimum density of a viable group ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "after some experimenting , i have chosen the following parameters to produce the reasonable - size halos : [ @xmath90 = [ 15,45,50 ] for the @xmath1 model , and [ 20,55,60 ] for the low @xmath4 models .",
    "the different sets of parameters are necessary because of the different masses of particles ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "figures [ fig : gal_om1][fig : gal_om.4l ] illustrate the location of particles in the identified halos . notice the filamentary structure of bound particles indicating the directions along which the halos continue to assemble .",
    "most galaxies in the central part of the simulation volume ( shown on the figures ) fall eventually into the forming cluster .",
    "because of the difference in particle masses , the @xmath1 halos contain significantly fewer particles than the @xmath2 halos .",
    "the mass function of the identified halos can be compared with the prediction of the press - schechter theory @xcite .",
    "i have calculated the expected number density of galaxies at @xmath92 using equations ( a4-a9 ) of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mf_all ] shows the halo mass functions in the three clusters .",
    "note the relative depletion of low mass halos in the simulations .",
    "this is partly due to the truncation of the input power spectrum at the nyquist frequency , which effectively prevents the formation of small - scale objects . for comparison ,",
    "the lower right panel shows the mass function obtained in the lower resolution , @xmath43 simulation of cluster iii . as expected , the smaller halos are depleted more strongly than the larger ones .      figures [ fig : traject_om1][fig : traject_om.4l ] show the trajectories of two selected halos in each cluster .",
    "these galaxies are used for the high resolution simulations in paper ii , representing a large spiral and a dwarf spheroidal , respectively .",
    "their trajectories are quite irregular .",
    "in the @xmath1 case , the galaxies are just entering the cluster at the present epoch , although not on a free - fall path .",
    "the orbits are similar to those shown in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the low @xmath4 cases the galaxies have enough time to move around the cluster center several times , more so in the open model .",
    "these differences will have major effects on the dynamical evolution of the galaxies .",
    "in general , there is a good agreement between the trajectories calculated using two different methods , especially for the less massive galaxies . for the very massive halos",
    ", the `` test particle '' motion occasionally tends to oscillate around the trajectory determined by the densest particle subset .",
    "i have therefore decided to use the latter as the more reliable trajectories .",
    "the hierarchical formation of clusters and the survival of substructure lead to more frequent collisions of galaxies and lower relative velocities at early epochs .",
    "preferentially radial infall implies that the final distribution of galaxies is very dense .",
    "most of the galaxies lie close to the cluster center , while the rest form a scarcely populated halo .",
    "the number density of massive galaxies ( @xmath93 ) can be fitted by a power law with a central core : @xmath94 normalized to the total number of galaxies @xmath95 within the virial radius of the cluster , @xmath96 .",
    "not all initially identified halos end up in the clusters , so with @xmath97 trying to estimate the core radius @xmath98 and the slope @xmath99 by fitting a histogram of galaxy positions yields highly uncertain results .",
    "instead , i use a maximum likelihood ( ml ) method analogous to that in @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 are to be determined by searching for the maximum of the ml function , @xmath100 . requiring the two partial derivatives of @xmath101 to vanish gives a system of two integral equations , which have been solved numerically using the software package maple .",
    "the resulting parameters are given in table [ tab : gal ] .",
    "the slopes of the density profile are steep , @xmath102 .",
    "the massive galaxies are more concentrated in the inner parts of the clusters than the dark matter which follows an approximately isothermal profile , @xmath103 . also , the core radii in all three clusters are very small , below the force resolution scale . at such small distances from the center",
    "the distribution of galaxies can be affected by the giant cd galaxy which may swallow its neighbors . to check this ,",
    "i have repeated the ml analysis excluding all galaxies within one resolution element , @xmath104 , from the center .",

    "the effect is mainly due to the concentration of galaxies at the center of the cluster , implying a smaller effective volume .",

    "note that the peaks of the tidal force are not always correlated with closest approach to the cluster center .",
    "the galaxies are being tidally `` shocked '' at 1 mpc from the center as often as at 400 kpc .",
    "even though the center of the cluster has been moving slowly in the simulation box , it is still likely that close encounters with massive galaxies or groups of galaxies happen relatively far from the center . as the cluster grows",

    "since large peaks of the tidal force dominate the total amount of heating ( see  [ sec : heating ] ) , i conclude that the tidal effects are produced primarily by the interaction of galaxies with the remaining substructure in clusters .",

    "the tidal force has many peaks of variable duration .",

    "the double derivatives , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , are calculated at the mesh points @xmath244 as @xmath245 where @xmath104 is the mesh size .",
    "the mixed derivatives , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 , are calculated using the smoothing in both directions : @xmath249 the coefficients are chosen such that the 4th derivative ( the smoothing order ) of the field is preserved .",
    "i take @xmath250 , which corresponds to the effective smoothing of the tidal field on the scale of @xmath251 kpc .",
    "the accuracy of the above smoothing has been tested against the analytic nfw model @xcite with the parameters of the cluster ii simulation : @xmath252 for the virial radius @xmath253 mpc and the `` concentration '' relation @xmath254 , the scale radius is @xmath255 mpc . in the @xmath44 simulation",
    "the grid cell size is @xmath256 kpc , so that @xmath257 .",
    "the exact tidal force in the nfw model is readily calculated using equation ( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : testderiv ] shows that our method reproduces well the mixed derivative @xmath246 down to 3 cell sizes from the center , and somewhat worse the double derivative @xmath241 . in the case of the mixed derivative , the filter may seem to be less accurate than the straightforward two - point finite difference . but in real simulations with numerical noise the smoothing filter becomes more effective and removes small - scale artifacts .      as another check of accuracy of the calculation of the tidal field ,",
    "i have run a test simulation of a one - dimensional zeldovich s pancake .",
    "the initial conditions are set up as described in @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the sine wave perturbation equals the size of the simulation box ; the maximum displacement is in the center .",
    "the simulation is run until a caustic of infinite density forms . from poisson",
    "s equation it follows that the only non - zero component of the tidal tensor is @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the density perturbation .",
    "i have run two simulations , with the high ( @xmath44 grid ) and low ( @xmath76 grid ) resolution .",
    "the density profile in both simulations is reproduced accurately .",
    "the calculated tidal force matches the exact solution in the beginning while the perturbation is small , but deviates at later times .",
    "the smoothing filter can not resolve a very narrow caustic .",
    "as expected , the higher - resolution simulation departs from the exact solution later than the lower - resolution one , at 70% vs 20% of the total simulation time .",
    "a similar effect of the resolution loss in high density regions in real simulations is emphasized again in the next section .",
    "large halos may contribute significantly to the amplitude of the local tidal field .",
    "if the halo extends over more than a couple of cells , it will contaminate the calculation of the _ external _ tidal force .",
    "it is therefore necessary to correct for the galactic self - contribution .    for this purpose ,",
    "i have implemented a potential solver for an isolated galaxy . on a rectangular grid of @xmath260 cells ,",
    "the density of the galactic particles is assigned using the cic method .",
    "then , the potential is obtained by the fft method with isolated boundary conditions . applying the same procedure for calculating the tidal tensor as above , i evaluate and subtract the halo self - contribution .",
    "the fft solver for poisson s equation with isolated boundary conditions is implemented following @xcite .",
    "the density grid is doubled in all three directions and padded with zeros in the added space .",
    "green s function is translated correctly to the new sections in real space and then fourier transformed and stored for the potential calculation .",
    "the trick with extending the grid is necessary in order to avoid the multiple images which appear in the usual fft with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting green s function @xmath261 differs from the usual form , @xmath262 , by cutting off the high frequency tail .",
    "afterwards the algorithm proceeds as usual : fourier transforming the density field , multiplying by @xmath261 , and transforming back to real space .",
    "the isolated fft procedure has been tested on the same @xmath260 grid , using @xmath263 particles distributed in the central cell according to the @xcite model : @xmath264 with a tiny core radius , @xmath265 .",
    "essentially , this is a point mass represented by particles .",
    "the algorithm reproduces the exact potential with very high accuracy , all the way to the edge of the simulation box .",
    "( for comparison , the periodic fft produces large errors on most of the grid . )",
    "the force calculation is limited in the center at @xmath266 , as in any grid - based method , but behaves perfectly well at larger radii . the force calculated with",
    "the periodic fft shows much more noise .",
    "another test has been applied to make sure the procedure works in a real simulation .",
    "the @xmath260 density field was calculated using the particles from a large galaxy , which were all located within a single grid cell and resembled a smoothed point source .",
    "although with increased scatter , the new method is still in a good agreement with the exact potential and force .",
    "figure [ fig : testtidal ] shows the self - contribution of a large galaxy in the cluster iii simulation . for the ease of comparison ,",
    "i plot the trace of the tidal tensor ( @xmath267 ) which is generally proportional to the density of galactic particles , in accord with poisson s equation .",
    "the smoothing filter misses the extreme variations of the density , but otherwise the amplitude of the tidal force is calculated correctly .",
    "also , figure [ fig : testtidal ] shows the scaling @xmath268 , which corresponds to a constant comoving density .",
    "the halo density follows this scaling quite closely indicating that the galaxy expands in real space .",
    "this numerical artifact is due to the loss of force resolution within a grid cell .",
    "the particles can not collapse below 1 @xmath104 , and therefore in comoving coordinates the galaxy continues to occupy the same volume .",
