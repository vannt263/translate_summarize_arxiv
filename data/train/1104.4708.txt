    "observation of quantum degeneracy of @xmath1k atoms @xcite in harmonically trapped geometry made the study of ultracold fermions an hunting ground to the experimentalists and theoreticians within the last ten years @xcite . in an initial remarkable experiment , demarco and jin measured the energy of harmonically trapped weakly interacting @xmath1k atoms for different temperatures ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "they plotted the deviation of the average energy of a single @xmath1k atom from its classical part ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this deviation ( excess energy ) particularly below the fermi temperature ( @xmath4 ) clearly indicates that @xmath1k atoms obey fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "they also compared their experimental data with the ideal gas prediction .",
    "although this prediction matches well with the experimental data yet the measured energy is a little higher , and it maintains a systematic narrow gap with it in particular for @xmath5 .",
    "it is obvious that smaller confinement and repulsive interparticle interaction increase the average energy of a particle .",
    "since the thermodynamic limit is not well satisfied for our system as its size ( @xmath6 ) and number ( @xmath7 ) of particles are small @xcite , finite size effect may contribute in removing the narrow gap between the theory and experiment .",
    "demarco and jin produced a nearly ideal fermi gas @xcite but the interparticle interaction can not absolutely be neglected @xcite , and it may also contribute in removing the gap .",
    "besides the study of strongly correlated electron ( fermi ) gas , weak interaction effects on fermi gas have also been studied for a long time @xcite . finite size effect on an ideal fermi gas",
    "was also studied a few decades ago @xcite . while the fermi gas for those cases are essentially homogeneous",
    ", the fermi gas of our interest is inhomogeneous being trapped by an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "finite size effect was explored for such a system by the authors of ref.@xcite in a way grossmann and holthaus did for bose gas @xcite .",
    "they considered the finite size effect on our system by adding the zero point energy of oscillation and a surface contribution to the bulk density of states @xcite .",
    "they showed that these two corrections cancel each other in the energy expression to the first order in angular frequency .",
    "consequently , they did not get considerable finite size correction at all .",
    "however , apart from these , finite size effect may also be there in measuring temperature @xcite , and in calculating the chemical potential as well .",
    "incorporationg this fearure one can get considerable finite size correction to the first order in angular frequency . along with the finite size effect we also consider the effect of weak interparticle interaction effect in energy for entire range of temperature .",
    "although the interest of exploring the thermodynamic behavior of an ultracold fermi gas has been moved to strongly correlated regime @xcite yet the same for weakly interacting regime has not surprisingly been studied except that for @xmath8 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we incorporate the temperature dependence of finite size and weak interaction effects on a harmonically trapped ultracold fermi gas in a perturbative manner .",
    "our calculation begins with a mean field hamiltonian where we consider short ranged interaction among the particles @xcite .",
    "we write the average occupation number for the interacting fermions in a self consisted way giorgini , pitaevskii and stringari wrote for an interacting bose gas @xcite .",
    "we obtain a considerable shift in chemical potential due to the interparticle interaction .",
    "then we incorporate finite size effect by considering shifts in temperature and chemical potential apart from the previous treatment @xcite .",
    "we eventually get the excess energy in a closed form of fugacity ( or chemical potential ) .",
    "then we obtain an approximate chemical potential in a closed form of temperature .",
    "we justify it to be good in fig .",
    "1 . this approximate chemical potential makes the excess energy in a closed form of temperature , and gives a plausibility in an analytic theory .",
    "then we replot the experimental data for evaporation ramp indicating the temperature dependence of the number of particles @xcite .",
    "we fit the data points in fig .",
    "2 . then we plot this excess energy for spin @xmath9 and @xmath10 particles in fig .",
    "3 considering the evaporation of particles from the trap , and compare our analytic result with the experimental data @xcite . then we also compare the interaction energy with the oscillator energy in fig .",
    "4 . as a corollary , we obtain a considerable shift in fermi energy due to the interparticle interaction .",
    "finally we compare the interaction and finite size effects in fig .",
    "let us consider a weakly interacting trapped fermi gas of @xmath11 number of 3-d anisotropic harmonic oscillators each having spin @xmath12 .",
    "each single particle state @xmath13 is described by a specific momentum ( @xmath14 ) and a specific position ( @xmath15 ) from the center of the trap , and each state of course has @xmath16 spin degeneracy ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we consider unequal number of particles in the two spin states .",
    "it is convenient to begin with an isotropic trap .",
    "we will consider the anisotropic trap later .",
    "expectation of the effective hamiltonian operator for our system ( in the mean field level ) is @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the mass of each particle , @xmath21 is the angular frequency of oscillations , @xmath22 is the coupling constant for the interparticle interaction ( @xmath23 @xcite ) , @xmath24 is the s - wave scattering length , @xmath25 is the complementary of spin @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the averaged number density of spin @xmath26 particles in equilibrium , and @xmath28 is the average number of spin @xmath26 particles in equilibrium at the single particle state @xmath13 .",
    "this number according to the fermi - dirac statistics is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the chemical potential for the weakly interacting fermions , @xmath31 is the mean field energy per particle , @xmath32 is the effective mean field potential for a spin @xmath26 particle in the harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "it is to be mentioned that zero point energy can not alter the number distribution of particles as any constant shift in @xmath33 can always be absorbed by @xmath30 .",
    "it is also to be mentioned that we can write eqn.(2 ) only in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 , where @xmath38 stands for total averaged number of particle having spin @xmath26 . in this limit",
    "any integral over the discrete levels @xmath39 ( of the oscillator energy : @xmath40 ) is the same as that over the phase space ( @xmath13 ) . integrating @xmath41 in eqn.(2 )",
    "we get @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the fugacity and @xmath44 is a fermi function ( or integral ) . in mathematics literature",
    "it is known as polylog function ( @xmath45 ) of order @xmath46 .",
    "the chemical potential ( or fugacity ) is to be obtained from the constraint that @xmath47 in an ideal situation ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath41 and @xmath49 in eqn.(2 ) become @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "thus for @xmath52 eqn.(4 ) becomes @xmath53      let the shift in chemical potential due to interaction is given by @xmath54 .",
    "this shift can now be obtained by the taylor expansion of @xmath55 in eqn.(3 ) about @xmath48 by considering @xmath56 an implicit function of @xmath57 .",
    "now , to the first order in @xmath57 and @xmath58 we can write @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number density for @xmath48 . for a given @xmath38 ,",
    "integrations of @xmath55 and @xmath60 in eqn.(6 ) over @xmath15 are the same .",
    "thus we get @xmath61f_{1/2}(z_\\sigma\\text{e}^{-\\frac{m\\omega^2r^2}{2kt}})d^3\\textbf{r}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , to the first order in @xmath57 and @xmath62 this shift is given by @xmath63 up to the first order in @xmath57 and zeroth order in @xmath21 . from eqn.(8 ) we can also say that fermi energy decreases due to the repulsive interparticle interaction among the particles .",
    "apart from introducing the zero point energy in eqn.(1 ) , finite size correction may also arise from the conversion of the summation over the discrete levels ( @xmath39 ) to the integration over ( @xmath39 ) or that over the phase space ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "this conversion would impose a correction in density of states , such that the surface part ( by name ) @xmath64 up to the first order in @xmath21 is to be added with the bulk part ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the bulk and surface parts correspond respectively to the first and second terms of the degeneracy ( @xmath66 ) of the @xmath67th level with energy @xmath68 .",
    "macrostate of our system in thermodynamic equilibrium can be described by the set @xmath69 , where @xmath2 and @xmath70 ( according to the zeroth law ) are characteristics of an heat and particle reservoir . for our finite system",
    ", temperature is not measured directly @xcite .",
    "it is measured from the momentum distribution of atoms obtained after free expansion switching the magnetic trap off @xcite .",
    "the measured distribution is fitted with the momentum distribution formula @xmath71 obtained from the fourier transform of @xmath55 in eqn.(3 ) @xcite .",
    "this fitting formula is true only in the thermodynamic limit , and in the classical limit , the width is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "effect of zero point motion , however , has not been included in this fitting formula .",
    "inclusion of this would certainly increase the width and the temperature as well .",
    "chemical potential on the other hand , is not usually measured , but obtained from eqn.(5 ) which is true only in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "now , we propose that actual temperature @xmath73 and chemical potential ( @xmath74 ) of a finite system are different from the measured and calculated value respectively , and they must be the same in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it should be mentioned that interparticle interaction may also change the momentum distribution , and we have already considered it as a shift in fugacity ( eqn.(8 ) ) only .",
    "we expect that @xmath75 would be positive for smaller confinement , and @xmath76 would be negative for a given @xmath38 . for @xmath48 , eqn.(4 ) along with the surface part of the integration now becomes @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the actual fugacity .",
    "let us further assume that @xmath79 only at the absolute zero . comparing eqns.(5 ) and ( 9 ) we get the finite size correction in chemical potential at @xmath80 as @xmath81 .",
    "henceforth we assume that @xmath82 is the same in all temperature .",
    "this implies that @xmath83 . thus keeping @xmath38 fixed in eqn.(9 )",
    "we get the shift in temperature in terms of @xmath84 as @xmath85 for bose gas , below @xmath86 , @xmath84 as well as @xmath87 has been assumed to be zero for obtaining a sharp condensation point ( @xmath86 ) and a considerable @xmath86 shift @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite also assumed the same for fermi gas , and eventually did not get any considerable finite size correction in energy .",
    "however , in reality a finite system of bose gas should not have a sharp condensation point @xcite , and energy of a fermi gas shows deviation from its bulky behavior @xcite .",
    "that is why we have assumed @xmath84 as well as @xmath87 to be nonzero .",
    "our assumption does not give a sharp condensation point of a bose gas , and on the other hand , it may considerably improve the ideal gas prediction for ultra - cold fermi gas @xcite .",
    "let us now obtain the total energy of the system .",
    "in an ideal situation ( @xmath48 ) , eqn.(1 ) along with the surface part of the integration gives the energy of spin @xmath26 particles up to the first order in @xmath21 as @xmath88.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so far we have considered our system to be isotropic ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the prescription for including anisotropy is to replace @xmath21 in the bulk part by its geometric mean ( @xmath90 ) , and in the finite size correction part by its arithmetic mean @xmath91 .",
    "thus we recast eqn.(11 ) along with eqns.(10 ) and ( 5 ) , and get energy per particle in terms of measured temperature as @xmath92.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "interaction energy per particle up to the first order in @xmath57 can be obtained from eqn.(1 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "it is however difficult to evaluate for the presence of different @xmath93 and @xmath94 in @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively . at this level",
    "we give an @xmath97 that @xmath98 .",
    "now , we get interaction energy per spin @xmath26 particle as @xmath99 where @xmath100 ^ 2\\text{x}^2\\text{d}\\text{x}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to check that for @xmath101 , the integral representation of @xmath102 in eqn.(14 ) can be approximated by the closed form @xmath103 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "energy per particle ( @xmath104 ) to the first order in @xmath91 and @xmath57 can be obtained as a summation of its two parts in eqn.(12 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "it is easy to check that its classical part is @xmath105 .",
    "thus we get excess energy per particle ( @xmath106 ) for our anisotropic system as @xmath107 - 1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 gets the value @xmath109 .      however , if we want to plot the excess energy with respect to @xmath2 we need to know the temperature dependence of @xmath70 from eqn.(5 ) .",
    "but it is impossible to know in a closed form as the inverse of a polylog function does not exist .",
    "there is no other way but to get @xmath70 in a closed form without approximation .",
    "however , whether an approximate @xmath70 is good can be justified from the exact graphical solutions which might have been used by demarco and jin @xcite . in the following we prescribe an approximate method for obtaining a good @xmath70 in a closed form relevant for the entire range of temperature .",
    "let us first investigate the approximate @xmath110 in the degenerate regime ( @xmath111 ) . for @xmath112 , fermi functions follow sommerfeld s asymptotic formula @xcite @xmath113^j}{\\gamma(j+1)}\\bigg[1+\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\frac{j(j-1)}{[\\mu^{(0)}_\\sigma / kt]^2}+ ...",

    "let us also investigate the approximate @xmath110 in the classical regime ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "taking only the first term of the taylor series expansion of @xmath118 we get the approximate chemical potential as @xmath119 although the approximate @xmath120 in eqn.(18 ) is valid for @xmath121 yet one can check that it is reasonably good even for @xmath122 .",
    "however , in demarco and jin s experiment @xcite , observation of quantum degeneracy was highlighted for @xmath123 .",
    "for this regime none of the above approximations is good . in the next",
    ", we present a calculation of obtaining a more accurate form of the chemical potential relevant not only for @xmath123 but for the entire range of temperature .",
    "classical result in eqn.(18 ) can be improved by considering the first three terms of the taylor series expansion of @xmath118 .",
    "real root for the cubic eqn . of @xmath51 now leads to @xmath124,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125^{1/3}$ ] and @xmath126 .",
    "sommerfeld s result ( eqn.(17 ) ) and the improved classical result ( eqn.(19 ) ) matches for @xmath127 .",
    "thus approximate chemical potential for @xmath128 can be written from eqns.(17 ) and ( 19 ) as @xmath129 comparing with the exact graphical solutions in fig .",
    "1 we can say that approximate @xmath120 in eqn.(20 ) is reasonably good for the entire range of temperature .",
    "however , for comparing our analytic result with the experimental data , we need to know the temperature dependence of number of particles that arises due to evaporation of particles during the experiment demarco and jin @xcite .",
    "although the average number of particles is not a constant yet they compared their experimental data with the ideal gas prediction . ideal gas prediction for a fixed @xmath38 remains unaltered if @xmath38 changes quasi - statistically with temperature .",
    "thus temperature dependence of @xmath38 in our theory would come only in the corrections parts in eqn.(15 ) .",
    "demarco and jin showed temperature dependence of @xmath130 in a figure keeping @xmath131 unchanged within @xmath132 error during the evaporation ramp @xcite .",
    "we replot their data in fig .",
    "2 , and a possible fitting for these data points is obtained with the help of wolfram mathematica , and is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 . from fig .",
    "2 we can see that @xmath130 varies from @xmath140 to @xmath141 as @xmath142 decreases from 2.7 to 0.5 .",
    "multiplying the right hand side of eqn.(21 ) by @xmath143 we get @xmath144 as well .",
    "have been adapted from ref.@xcite .",
    "solid line represents a possible fitting ( eqn.(21 ) ) for the data points . ]",
    "we put the temperature dependence particles only in the correction parts in eqn.(15 ) and plot the excess energy ( with the approximate chemical potential in eqn.(20 ) ) in fig . 3 for spin @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 particles .",
    "in the same figure we also plot the ideal gas prediction putting @xmath145 and @xmath48 in eqn.(15 ) . from this figure we can say that our analytic result matches better with the experimental data .     and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "several experimental points have been adapted from ref.@xcite . here",
    "we take @xmath146 , @xmath147 hz , @xmath148 hz , @xmath131 @xcite , and @xmath149 @xcite . ]",
    "as a consistency check and for showing plausibility of our theory , let us now compare the interaction energy and potential energy for different temperatures .",
    "it is easy to understand from eqn.(13 ) that @xmath150 is the total interaction energy ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "we can also say from the virial theorem that @xmath152 is the total oscillator energy ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "thus from eqn.(15 ) , we get their ratio for @xmath154 as @xmath155 we plot the right hand side of eqn.(22 ) for a fixed number of particles in fig .",
    "however , to obtain @xmath156 for @xmath8 , we must need to know the asymptotic expansions of @xmath157 and @xmath102 . while the first one is followed from eqn.(16 )",
    "second one is to be obtained from eqn.(14 ) . in the integral representation of @xmath102 ,",
    "the fermi function contributes essentially for @xmath158 .",
    "now , from eqns.(14 ) and ( 16 ) we get the desired asymptotic expansion as @xmath159.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this form has been used in fig . 4 in particular for @xmath160 .",
    "thus for @xmath8 , eqn.(22 ) gives @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the confining length scale for a harmonically trapped particle at the ground state .",
    "one can check that eqn.(24 ) is consisted with the thomas - fermi result for @xmath8 @xcite . as a corollary of the asymptotic expansion",
    ", we can also calculate the shift in fermi energy ( from eqn.(8 ) ) due to interaction as @xmath163    .",
    "solid and dashed lines represent the ratio of interaction and finite size corrections ( in eqn.(15 ) ) for spin @xmath9 and @xmath10 particles respectively . ]",
    "it is not clear from fig .",
    "3 how big is the finite size correction with respect to the interaction correction . dividing @xmath164 by @xmath165 in eqn.(15 )",
    "we get the ratio of the interaction and finite size correction , and plot it in fig . 4 for spin @xmath9 and @xmath10 particles with the experimental parameters used in fig 3 . from fig .",
    "4 we can say that interaction and finite size corrections are comparable within the temperature range of our interest .",
    "this comparison for @xmath166 , however , is ill defined as the temperature dependence of @xmath38 is insensitive for @xmath116 in fig .",
    "we have presented an analytic calculation for exploring thermodynamic behavior of a harmonically trapped weakly interacting fermi gas through the temperature dependent energy .",
    "our result for @xmath112 and @xmath167 , reproduces the standard thomas - fermi @xcite and classical results @xcite respectively , and of course matches better with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "since the number density of the fermions in the trap is reasonably low ( @xmath168 ) one may expect ladder approximation as a better choice with respect to our choice for the mean field ( hartree - fock ) approximation @xcite .",
    "however , we can not get any contribution from the ladder diagrams if we consider short ranged interaction ( @xmath23 ) among the particles .",
    "hence , hartree - fock approximation is reasonably good even for the low dense gas considered by us .",
    "finite size and interaction corrections scheme prescribed here is general to both the fermi gas and bose gas . for bose gas ,",
    "fermi functions ( @xmath169 ) are to be replaced by the bose - einstein functions ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "we also have obtained an approximate chemical potential in a closed form of temperature so that theoretical study of weakly interacting fermi gas has been made plausible in the entire range of temperature .",
    "our main new result is the finite size correction part in eqn.(15 ) which although seems obvious yet nobody got that even for bose gas before us by assuming shifts in temperature and chemical potential as finite size corrections .",
    "for these assumptions , we are the first to get finite size correction in energy to the first order in @xmath171 which before us was believed to be of @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "this first order correction along with interparticle interaction in eqn.(15 ) may considerably improve the ideal gas prediction .",
    "excess energy in other experiments also found to be a little larger with respect to the ideal gas prediction @xcite .",
    "our result ( for the finite size and interaction corrections ) are somewhat uncertain at the present level of accuracy @xcite , and compelling the experimental evidences for its presence .",
    "future experiment with reduced error may confirm our prediction .",
