    "clusters of galaxies are the largest objects in the universe , and consist of several tens or more galaxies that are bound together by gravity @xcite .",
    "they consist of galaxies , an intracluster medium ( icm ) which is a high - temperature plasma gas , and dark matter .",
    "numerical simulations show that many clusters of galaxies grow by merging during the formation of large - scale structures ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "investigations of merging clusters are necessary not only to understand the evolution of clusters of galaxies , themselves , but also to tracing the structure formation of the universe .",
    "merging clusters that violently come into collision are well studied because they exhibit interesting features , such as extreme variations in the temperature and the density distributions of icm ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , such intensely merging clusters are very few , and mostly giant cluster cannibalize small clusters or groups of galaxies . therefore , it is important to investigate such a general type merging clusters .",
    "drastic heating of icm by shock wave is not expected in such cases , and the early stage of merging occurs in the outer region with low x - ray luminosity .",
    "therefore , highly accurate temperature determinations and photon - collecting power are required for investigating of such merging clusters .    as a result of recent advances in x - ray observations ,",
    "it is possible to find local high - temperature icm regions that reveal the existence of merging in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , even more accurate x - ray observations are required to investigate in detail the shock heating by merging .",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : @xcite ) and x - ray telescope on board the x - ray observatory suzaku have a low background in the high - energy band and a large collecting area , respectively .",
    "suzaku is currently the best x - ray observatory for observing general merging clusters because its instruments are very effective in detecting hot , diffuse regions , such as shocked regions .",
    "the abell 85 cluster ( hereafter , a 85 ) is a nearby ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) typical merging cluster in which a giant cluster is cannibalizing small clusters .",
    "a 85 has been observed so far by many x - ray observation satellites ( e.g. , rosat , @xcite ; asca , @xcite ; chandra , @xcite ; xmm - newton , durret et al . 2003 , 2005 , hereafter d05 ) and in other wavelength regions ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations have revealed a bright subcluster located about south of a 85 .",
    "figure 3 in d05 showed that a high - temperature region was found between the main part of a 85 and the subcluster , and they argued that this `` impact region '' might be thermalized by merging with the subcluster .",
    "however , this map did not cover the wide surrounding regions of the subcluster because of low signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "based on the high statistics temperature map obtained from suzaku observations , we investigated the merging situations and the motion of the subcluster .",
    "the suzaku observations and data reduction are described in  2 , and the results of data analysis are given in  3 .",
    "we discuss for the impact direction , velocity and motion of the subcluster in  4 .",
    "finally , the findings of the present study are summarized in  5 . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume that @xmath8 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . at the cluster redshift , @xmath7 ,",

    "all quoted errors are at the 90@xmath12 confidence level unless otherwise stated .",
    "we observed a 85 located at ( ra , dec ) @xmath13 ( , ) @xcite in equatorial coordinates using suzaku @xcite on january 2007 with a net exposure time of 99.2 ks .",
    "the suzaku pointing position is @xmath0 south from the center ( the peak of x - ray surface brightness distribution ) of a 85 , which is ( ra , dec ) @xmath13 ( , ) in equatorial coordinates .",
    "this position has been termed the `` impact region '' in d05 .",
    "the xis field of view ( fov ) is presented at the left side of figure [ fig : xmm - img ] on the x - ray image taken by xmm  newton .",
    "we obtained the xis and the hard x - ray detector ( @xcite ; @xcite ) data , but the xis data are used only in this paper because we perform a spatially resolved spectral analysis .",
    "the xis is an x - ray ccd camera that consists of one back - illuminated ( bi ) sensor ( xis1 ) and three front - illuminated ( fi ) sensors ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) .",
    "each ccd covers a field of view of @xmath14 , and has a spatial resolution of about in half power diameter ( hpd ) .",
    "the bi sensor has a higher quantum efficiency in the soft energy band , whereas the fi sensors have lower instrumental non x - ray background ( nxb ) in the hard energy band .    in this observation ,",
    "the xis2 data are not available because of the xis2 anomaly .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal clocking and 3 @xmath14 3 or 5 @xmath14 5 editing modes , and the `` spaced - row charge injection '' ( sci : uchiyama et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) option was applied .",
    "energy resolutions ( full width at half maximum ; fwhm ) of fi and bi data in this observation are 5.9 kev of @xmath0 150 ev and @xmath0 170 ev , respectively .",
    "we used reprocessed , unfiltered xis event files ( version 2.0 ) using heasoft v6.5.1 ( suzaku software v10.0 ) and the calibration database ( caldb ) released on 2008 september 5 .",
    "the energy correction was performed by using `` xispi '' , and events were selected by using `` grade@xmath130:0 2:4 6:6 '' and `` status@xmath130:65535 '' .",
    "good time intervals ( gti ) were determined by the standard criteria referred to `` updated gain calibration for sci - on data nov 15 , 2007 . '' to remove hot / flickering pixels , we applied `` cleansis '' to the event file . the x - ray image generated from the cleaned event file",
    "is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : xmm - img ] .    for spectral analysis ,",
    "redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) were made by using `` xisrmfgen '' and `` xissimarfgen '' @xcite .",
    "the xmm mos1 image of a 85 was used as the source distribution , after subtracting the background , but not correcting the vignetting effect . using a different source image",
    ", we confirm that the vignetting correction is insignificant in spectral analysis compared to the statistical errors on the results .",
    "the background components , the nxb and the extragalactic cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , were estimated by the following procedure .",
    "the nxb images and spectra were made by using `` xisnxbgen '' @xcite .",
    "for the cxb spectra , we referred to a method described in @xcite .",
    "the arf of a one - degree - radius uniform sky and the rmf were used to construct a cxb spectrum with the `` fakeit '' command of xspec ( version 12.4.0ad ) .",
    "the spectrum model of the cxb was a power - law model with photon index @xmath15 and @xmath16[210 kev]@xmath17 , where @xmath16[210 kev ] is the x - ray surface brightness in the 210 kev energy band @xcite , and @xmath18 was adopted as the hydrogen absorption column density @xcite . using the same requirement ,",
    "the cxb events were created by `` xissim '' command to make the cxb images .",
    "a bright point source was detected at the position of ( ra , dec ) @xmath13 ( , ) in the xmm image .",
    "we call this source dfl2005 - 17 , since it is named `` source 17 '' in table 1 of d05 .",
    "the contribution of this point source in spectral analysis is insignificant because the flux in the 210 kev energy band obtained from xmm - newton data is less than 10% of the flux in suzaku hpd , indicated by the black circle in the right panel of figure [ fig : xmm - img ] .",
    "therefore , we neglect its contribution for spectral analysis hereafter . based on the rosat all - sky survey image ( snowden et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) , the surface brightness of the galactic soft x - ray diffuse background around a 85 is relatively low",
    ". therefore , we apply a simple model for estimating this component .",
    "in this subsection , we generate an x - ray hardness ratio map and examine the overall temperature structure of the cluster .",
    "the two fi ccd data ( xis0 and xis3 ) are added together to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the bi data was not used in this analysis because of their higher backgrounds at high energy above 5 kev . after subtracting the background components ( nxb and the power - low cxb ) , we made hard ( 310  kev ) and soft ( 0.52  kev ) x - ray images .",
    "figure [ fig : hard ] shows the obtained hardness ratio and its relative error maps .    between the main cluster and the subcluster ,",
    "there is a hard region that was reported previously ( d05 ) .",
    "moreover , we found a much harder spot on the east side of the subcluster .",
    "note that this is @xmath0 away from the point source , dfl2005 - 17 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this spot as the hot spot .",
    "although a part of this hot spot may have been seen in the xmm - newton results , main parts of the spot are not included in the analysis region of d05 ( see figure 3 in d05 ) .",
    "the relative error map indicates that the detection of the hot spot has statistical significance ( with a relative error @xmath19 15% ) .",
    "therefore , the suzaku observation detected this hot spot robustly for the first time .",

    "the energy range of the anomalous response around the si k - edge ( 1.8251.840 kev ) has been excluded in both cases . to describe the cluster emission",
    ", we used a collisional ionization equilibrium model ( apec ; @xcite ) modified by the galactic photoelectric absorption ( wabs in the xspec ) , using xspec .",
    "the galactic hydrogen column density was fixed to the reported value , 2.80 @xmath20 @xcite . to model the galactic soft x - ray background ,",

    "this high - temperature region ( hot spot ) has not been reported so far . from the location of the hot spot , we consider that a postshock region produced by the infall of the subcluster from the southwest , in contrast to previous studies , which have recognized that the subcluster is infalling from the southeast .    by using the rankine ",
    "hugoniot jump conditions for shocks , mach number and the infall velocity of the subcluster are estimated to be @xmath1 and @xmath2 km s@xmath3 , respectively . on the other hand , by using the redshifts of the subcluster s member galaxies obtained from optical observations , the radial ( line - of - sight ) velocity difference between the subcluster and a 85 was found to be @xmath105 km s@xmath3 , in excess for the subcluster .",
    "these velocities yield the conclusion that the angle between the line of sight and the direction of the motion of the subcluster is @xmath4 degrees .",
    "the present kinetic energy of the subcluster and the energy loss by the icm heating are roughly estimated to be @xmath5 and @xmath6 erg , respectively .",
    "this means that the subcluster is scarcely decelerated by icm heating .",
