    "@xmath0ne has been known as a typical example of a nucleus which has @xmath1 cluster structure .",
    "there have been numerous works based on the cluster model , which explain the observed doublet rotational band structure .",
    "in addition to the ground @xmath7 band , the negative parity band ( @xmath8 ) starting with the @xmath9 state at @xmath10 mev has been observed , and existence of this `` low - lying '' negative parity band is the strong evidence that simple spherical mean field is broken .",
    "these bands are well explained by the picture that @xmath1 cluster is located at some distance from the @xmath2o core @xcite .",
    "recently `` container picture '' has been proposed to describe the non - localization of the @xmath1 cluster around @xmath2o @xcite .    however , according to the shell model , four nucleons perform independent particle motions around the @xmath2o core , which has doubly closed shell of the @xmath11 shell , and the spin - orbit interaction acts attractively to them .",
    "if we apply simple @xmath1 cluster models , we can not take into account this spin - orbit effect . in traditional @xmath1 cluster models ,",
    "@xmath1 cluster is defined as @xmath12 configuration centered at some localized point , and the contributions of non - central interactions vanish .",
    "if we correctly take into account the spin - orbit effect , @xmath1 cluster structure competes with the @xmath3-coupling shell model structure .",
    "previously we have investigated this competition in @xmath0ne based on the antisymmetrized quasi - cluster model ( aqcm ) @xcite .",
    "aqcm is a method that enables us to describe a transition from the @xmath1 cluster wave function to the @xmath3-coupling shell model wave function @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the cluster - shell transition is characterized by only two parameters ; @xmath4 representing the distance between @xmath1 cluster and core nucleus and @xmath5 describing the breaking of the @xmath1 cluster . by introducing @xmath5",
    ", we transform @xmath1 cluster to quasi cluster , and the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction , very important in the @xmath3-coupling shell model , can be taken into account .",
    "it was found that the level structure of the yrast states of @xmath0ne strongly depends on the strength of the spin - orbit interaction in the hamiltonian .    in this article",
    "we apply aqcm again to @xmath0ne and introduce @xmath2o plus one quasi cluster model .",
    "particularly we focus on the effect of cluster - shell competition on the @xmath6 transition .",
    "the @xmath6 transition operator has the form of monopole operator , @xmath13 , and this operator changes the nuclear sizes .",
    "however , changing nuclear density uniformly requires quite high excitation energy . on the other hand ,",
    "clusters structures are characterized as weakly interacting states of strongly bound subsystems .",
    "thus it is rather easy for the cluster states to change the sizes without giving high excitation energies ; this is achieved just by changing the relative distances between clusters .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 transitions in low - energy regions are expected to be signatures of the cluster structures , and many works along this line are going on @xcite .    in our preceding work for @xmath2o @xcite",
    ", we found that the ground state has a compact four @xmath1 structure and is almost independent of the strength of the spin - orbit interaction ; however the second @xmath14 state , which has been known as a @xmath15c+@xmath1 cluster state , is very much affected by the change of the strength . with increasing the strength ,",
    "the level repulsion and crossing occur , and the @xmath16 cluster part changes from three @xmath1 configuration to the @xmath17 subclosure of the @xmath3-coupling shell model .",
    "the @xmath6 transition matrix elements are strongly dependent on this level repulsion and crossing , and they are sensitive to the persistence of @xmath18 correlation in the excited states . here , `` larger cluster '' part of binary cluster system ( @xmath15c part of @xmath15c+@xmath1 ) has been changed into quasi cluster .",
    "the present study on @xmath0ne is different from the preceding work on @xmath2o in the following two points .",
    "one is that we focus on the change of `` smaller cluster '' part of the binary cluster system , and in this case , we change @xmath1 cluster around the @xmath2o core to quasi cluster .",
    "another difference is that this change influences very much the ground state ( in the case of @xmath2o , the second @xmath14 state with the @xmath15c+@xmath1 configuration is affected by the spin - orbit interaction ) .",
    "since other higher nodal states are determined by the orthogonal condition to the ground state , this change also has influences on the wave functions of the excited states .",
    "naturally @xmath6 transition matrix elements are also affected by this change .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formulation is given in sect .",
    "[ model ] . in sect .",
    "[ results ] , the results for @xmath0ne are shown . finally , in sect .  [ summary ] we summarize the results and give the main conclusion .",
    "the wave function of the total system @xmath19 is antisymmetrized product of these single particle wave functions ; @xmath20 the projection onto parity and angular momentum eigen states can be numerically performed .",
    "the number of mesh points for the integral over euler angles is @xmath21 .      for the single particle orbits of the @xmath2o part",
    ", we introduce conventional @xmath1 cluster model .",
    "the single particle wave function has a gaussian shape @xcite ; @xmath22 \\eta_{i } , \\label{brink - wf}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 represents the spin - isospin part of the wave function , and @xmath24 is a real parameter representing the center of a gaussian wave function for the @xmath25th particle . for the width parameter",
    ", we use the value of @xmath26 fm , @xmath27 . in this brink - bloch wave function , four nucleons in one @xmath1 cluster share the common @xmath24 value .",
    "hence , the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction vanishes .",
    "we introduce four different kinds of @xmath24 values , and four @xmath1 clusters are forming tetrahedron configuration .",
    "when we take the limit of the relative distances between @xmath1 cluster to zero , the wave function coincide with the closed @xmath11 shell configuration of the shell model @xcite , and this limit is called elliot su(3 ) limit @xcite . in our model , the relative distance is taken to be a small value , 0.1 fm .",
    "we add one quasi cluster around the @xmath2o core based on aqcm . in the aqcm",
    ", @xmath1 clusters are changed into quasi clusters . for nucleons in the quasi cluster ,",
    "the single particle wave function is described by a gaussian wave packet , and the center of this packet @xmath28 is a complex parameter ; @xmath29 \\chi_{i } \\tau_{i } ,   \\label{aqcm_sp}\\ ] ] @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "represent the intrinsic spin and isospin part of the @xmath25th single particle wave function , respectively . in eq",
    ", @xmath33 is a unit vector for the orientation of the intrinsic spin @xmath31 .",
    "here , @xmath5 is a real control parameter describing the dissolution of the @xmath1 cluster .",
    "the width parameter is the same as nucleons in the @xmath2o cluster ( @xmath26 fm , @xmath27 ) .",
    "as one can see immediately , the @xmath34 aqcm wave function , which has no imaginary part , is the same as the conventional brink - bloch wave function .",
    "the aqcm wave function corresponds to the @xmath3-coupling shell model wave function when @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the mathematical explanation is summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "gaussian center parameters for the four nucleons in the quasi cluster ( @xmath37 ) are given in the following way .",
    "we place quasi cluster on the @xmath38 axis , and the real part of the gaussian center parameters ( @xmath39 ) are given as @xmath40 here @xmath4 is a parameter , which describes the distance between quasi cluster and the @xmath2o cluster , and @xmath41 is the unit vector in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "next , we give the imaginary parts . here",
    "we quantize the spin of the nucleons along the @xmath42 axis , and in order to satisfy the condition of eq .",
    ", we must give the imaginary parts in the @xmath43 direction as , @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are unit vectors in the @xmath38 and @xmath50 direction , respectively .",
    "the gaussian center parameter @xmath51 is for a proton with spin up ( @xmath52 direction ) , @xmath53 is for a proton with spin down ( @xmath54 direction ) , @xmath55 is for a neutron with spin up ( @xmath52 direction ) , and @xmath56 is for a neutron with spin down ( @xmath54 direction ) .",
    "when @xmath5 is set to zero , the wave function consisting the quasi clusters agrees with that of an @xmath1 cluster . if we take the limit of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , four nucleons in the quasi cluster occupy @xmath59 orbits of the @xmath3-coupling shell model .      for the hamiltonian , we use volkov no.2 @xcite as an effective interaction for the central part with the majorana exchange parameter of @xmath60 . for the spin - orbit part , g3rs @xcite , which is a realistic interaction originally determined to reproduce the nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shift ,",
    "is adopted ; @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is a projection operator onto a triplet odd state .",
    "the operator @xmath66 stands for the relative angular momentum and @xmath67 is the spin ( @xmath68 ) . in the present work ,",
    "the strength of the spin - orbit interaction , @xmath69 , is a parameter as in ref .",
    "@xcite and we compare the results by changing the value .",
    "in this section , we apply our aqcm wave function introduced in the previous section to @xmath0ne and discuss the @xmath69 ( strength of the spin - orbit interaction ) dependence of energy levels and @xmath6 transition probabilities .",
    "the @xmath69 value is changed from 0 mev to 3000 mev , and reasonable value of around @xmath70 mev has been suggested in our preceding work @xcite .",
    "we prepare aqcm wave functions with different @xmath4 and @xmath5 values as basis states of generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "the adopted values are @xmath71 fm and @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath14 energies of these basis states are presented in table  [ basis ] , and here , we show the values for two extreme cases for the strengths of the spin - orbit interaction ; ( a ) @xmath73 mev and ( b ) @xmath74 mev .",
    "the @xmath14 energies of the gcm basis states corresponding to other @xmath69 values can be estimated just by interpolating these values linearly .    in table",
    "[ basis ]  ( a ) , we find that @xmath34 basis states give lower energies than @xmath5 finite basis states .",
    "this is because of the absence of the spin - orbit interaction ; introducing imaginary part for the gaussian center parameters does not work for the spin - orbit interaction and that simply increases the kinetic energy of four nucleons in the quasi cluster . here",
    "the basis state with @xmath75 fm ( @xmath34 ) gives the lowest energy of @xmath76 mev .    on the contrary",
    ", table  [ basis ]  ( b ) is the case of @xmath74 mev , and basis states with finite @xmath5 values get much lower , since the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction can be taken into account by transforming the @xmath1 cluster to quasi cluster . the basis state which gives the lowest energy has the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 fm ( @xmath79 mev ) .",
    "this result suggests that when the spin - orbit interaction is switched on , the @xmath4 value of the optimal basis state becomes smaller and the @xmath5 value increases .",
    "this means that not only the @xmath1 cluster dissolutes into quasi cluster , the relative distance between the cluster and the @xmath2o core decreases .",
    "( a )    .the @xmath14 energies of gcm basis states for the cases of different strengths of the spin - orbit interaction ; ( a ) @xmath73 mev and ( b ) @xmath74 mev .",
    "the @xmath14 energies of the gcm basis states with other @xmath69 values can be estimated by linearly interpolating these two . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sqol-1- ]",
    "we have applied aqcm , which is a method to describe a transition from the @xmath1-cluster wave function to the @xmath3-coupling shell model wave function , to @xmath0ne .",
    "@xmath0ne has been known as a nucleus which has @xmath2o+@xmath1 structure , and we investigated how the @xmath1 cluster structure competes with independent particle motions of these four nucleons by changing the strength of the spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "we focused on the @xmath6 transition matrix element , which was found to be sensitive to @xmath69 .",
    "based on aqcm , @xmath0ne is characterized by only two parameters ; @xmath4 representing the relative distance between @xmath2o and @xmath1 and @xmath5 describing the breaking of @xmath1 cluster . when the spin - orbit interaction is switched off ( @xmath73 mev )",
    ", the ground @xmath14 state has the squared overlap of 0.92 with the gcm basis state which has @xmath75 fm and @xmath34 .",
    "the second @xmath14 state is a higher nodal state and it has 0.74 with @xmath80 fm and @xmath81 .",
    "the third @xmath14 state also has large @xmath2o-@xmath1 distance , and the fourth @xmath14 state has overlaps with basis states with finite @xmath5 values .",
    "when the spin - orbit interaction is switched on , we found that the decrease of the energy for the fourth @xmath14 state at @xmath73 is much steeper than other states .",
    "eventually the wave function of the fourth @xmath14 state at @xmath73 mev strongly mixes in the ground and second @xmath14 states at @xmath74 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the wave function of the second @xmath14 state at @xmath73 mev almost stays at this energy .",
    "similar thing can be found for the third @xmath14 state at @xmath73 mev .",
    "these two states correspond to the third and fourth @xmath14 states at @xmath74 mev , and @xmath1 cluster structure becomes important again there .",
    "the @xmath6 transition matrix elements from the ground state to the second @xmath14 state is calculated as 10.0 @xmath82 @xmath83 at @xmath73 mev , which is slightly larger than the experimental value ( 6.914 @xmath82 @xmath83 ) . with increasing @xmath69 value ,",
    "the mixing of basis states with finite @xmath5 values becomes important in both the ground and second @xmath14 states , and the @xmath6 transition matrix decreases .",
    "the value agrees with the experimental one around @xmath84 mev .",
    "this deduced strength is consistent with our preceding work on the level structure of this nucleus .    at @xmath84 mev , which is the spin - orbit strength deduced from the present analysis on the @xmath6 transition matrix element , the ground state has the squared overlap of 0.78 with the basis state which has @xmath75 fm and @xmath81 , and the character at @xmath73",
    "mev still remains .",
    "however the largest squared overlap of 0.82 is with the basis state which has @xmath85 fm and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 breaking effect due to the spin - orbit interaction is also important in the ground state .",
    "the second @xmath14 states has squared overlap of 0.40 with the basis state which has @xmath87 fm and @xmath34 ; however , it has also components of the basis states with finite @xmath5 values .",
    "the third and fourth @xmath14 states are @xmath1 cluster states and contain the components of basis states with large @xmath4 values .",
    "the presence of low - lying negative parity band starting with the first @xmath9 has been the key evidence for the @xmath1 cluster structure .",
    "we also investigated the @xmath9 states and found that the energy of the first @xmath9 state is almost constant even if the spin - orbit interaction is switched on and @xmath1 breaking basis states are introduced .",
    "the @xmath1 cluster structure is really important in this state .",
    "there have been discussions that the @xmath15c+@xmath1+@xmath1 cluster states appear in this energy region of the third @xmath14 state , and inclusion of this configuration can be done by applying aqcm to the three @xmath1 clusters in the @xmath2o core .",
    "also , here we transformed an @xmath1 cluster to four independent nucleons , in which the spin - orbit interaction acts attractively .",
    "however , in principle it is possible to introduce other shell model configurations , for instance configurations where the spin - orbit interaction acts repulsively , or one of the nucleon is excited from @xmath88-upper orbit to @xmath88-lower orbit .",
