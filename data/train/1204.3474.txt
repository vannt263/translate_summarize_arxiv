    "low dimensional quantum spin systems have been active subjects in quantum many - body physics for many years .",
    "owing to strong quantum fluctuations and competitions between various interactions in these systems , a number of exotic and fascinating quantum emergent phenomena are expected to occur , which thus arouses persistently considerable interest not only in condense matter physics but also in other fields such as quantum information and quantum computation @xcite .    among others ,",
    "the spin-1 bond alternating heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain ( bahafc ) in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields is of particular interest , for a series of materials , such as nenp @xcite , nmoap @xcite , ndoap @xcite , and ntenp @xcite can be well described by the spin s=1 bahafc , and the ideal model compound ni(c@xmath3h@xmath4n@xmath5)(no@xmath6)clo@xmath5 ( ntenp ) has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically in recent years [ ] , where the effects of magnetic field and the bond alternating ratio on low - lying magnetic excitations , spin correlations and low - temperature specific heat of the compound ntenp have been investigated .",
    "it is known that in a magnetic field the one - dimensional ( 1d ) heisenberg quantum spin chains with periodic ground states would exhibit a topological quantization of magnetization according to the necessary condition @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the period of the system , @xmath9 is the spin and @xmath10 is the magnetization per site .",
    "such magnetic plateau states have been addressed in some polymerized heisenberg antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic spin chains ( e.g. refs . [ ] ) .",
    "high - field magnetization measurements on ntenp also revealed that a @xmath11 magnetization plateau appears around 700 koe @xcite ; the neutron scattering experiments indicated that the spin dynamics of ntenp quite differs from that of a haldane spin chain @xcite ; and the low - temperature specific heat measurement showed a tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) behavior in ntenp in a longitudinal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "although the experimental studies on ntenp gain obvious advances , some ambiguities still remain on further understanding its physical properties .",
    "for instance , the compound ntenp was experimentally studied under both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields , but only the data in a longitudinal field have been fitted by quantum monte carlo simulations ; no direct numerical evidence of low - temperature specific heat of this material was reported to verify the tll behavior ; the sharp peaks of the specific heat in the ntenp were observed experimentally in both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields , where the peak positions move to high temperature side with the increase of the transverse field , while retain almost intact with increasing the longitudinal field ; and so on .",
    "the remaining issues are very worthy to address .    apart from that the spin-1 bahafc with a single - ion anisotropy [ eq .",
    "( [ eq - hamiltonian ] ) below ] is believed to be a pertinent model in describing the physical characters of ntenp , which has been studied previously @xcite , this model itself has also fascinating properties that deserve to investigate .",
    "when the bond alternating ratio @xmath12 , it reduces to the singlet dimers ; when @xmath13 , it becomes a spin-1 uniform chain ( haldane chain ) . in these two special cases ,",
    "the system shows an excitation gap from the singlet dimer or haldane ground state to the triplet excited state .",
    "the latter uniform chain under both longitudinal ( @xmath14 ) and transverse ( @xmath15 ) magnetic fields has been extensively discussed ( e.g. refs . [ ] ) .",
    "however , the overall phase diagrams in @xmath16 plane for the s=1 bahafc with a single - ion anisotropy are still absent .",
    "therefore , it is really necessary to tackle these above questions .    in this paper , by means of jointly the infinite time evolving block decimation ( itebd ) @xcite , the linearized tensor renormalization group ( ltrg ) @xcite , and the density matric renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods @xcite , we shall study systematically the ground state phase diagrams , magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the s=1 bahafc with a single - ion anisotropy in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields .",
    "the itebd , ltrg and dmrg methods are the numerical algorithms with very good accuracy and high efficiency that were recently developed for low - dimensional quantum lattice systems , which allow for calculating with nice precision the critical properties and the extremely low temperature behaviors of quantum many - body lattice systems .",
    "these methods can assist us to fit well the experimental data on the ntenp with the accurately calculated results , thereby capable of reasonably determining the material parameters and better understanding the fundamental features of the ntenp in both longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields .",
    "let us start with the model hamiltonian given by @xmath17 , \\label{eq - hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the coupling constant , @xmath19 ( even ) is the number of lattice sites , @xmath20 is the spin operator at @xmath21th site , @xmath22 is the single - ion anisotropy , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the land g - factors , @xmath25 is the bohr magneton , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields , respectively .    in the following calculations , @xmath26 is assumed unless the fittings to experimental data are concerned , and @xmath18 is taken as the energy scale .",
    "the ground state properties were studied by utilizing the itebd @xcite imaginary time projection scheme along with dmrg method @xcite , and the thermodynamic properties and fittings to the experimental data of ntenp were performed by invoking the ltrg approach @xcite . in itebd calculations",
    "we take the smallest trotter step @xmath27 .      , where three magnetization plateaux ( @xmath28 , 1/2 , and 1 ) are observed .",
    "the inset shows the singularities of the susceptibility as a function of magnetic field , which signal the occurrence of quantum phase transitions .",

    "( [ eq - hamiltonian ] ) in the longitudinal magnetic field for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the bond dimension @xmath34 of a matrix product state is presumed . when @xmath32 , it is clear to see that there are three magnetization plateaux occurring at @xmath10=0 , 1/2 and 1 in some regions of @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath10=0 plateau suggests that a gap remains in the absence of magnetic field , implying that the system is in the singlet - dimer phase , as it should be in the same phase as @xmath12 .",
    "based on the valence - bond solid picture , the @xmath11 plateau corresponds to that one of the two bonds in each coupled spin-1 dimer is broken @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 plateau is in the spin fully polarized state . near the critical fields",
    ", the magnetization per site @xmath31 depends on the magnetic field in a square root behavior , similar to the case of spin-1 hafc in a magnetic field . in the ranges between the plateaus",
    ", the spin correlations should be in a power law decay , indicating a quasi long - range order .",
    "the critical magnetic fields for closure of the gap can be accurately determined by the field dependence of the susceptibility , where the sharp peaks appear , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "when @xmath36 , the three magnetic plateaux still remain , but the width of @xmath2 plateau decreases , indicating that the corresponding gap becomes narrower . for the spin-1 bahafc ,",
    "as the ground state period is @xmath37 , the topological quantization condition @xmath7 is satisfied by @xmath10=0 , 1/2 and 1 , i.e. , there should exist at most three plateaux in the longitudinal field for @xmath38 , which is well confirmed in fig .",
    "at the special case of @xmath13 , @xmath8 becomes 1 , and there should be two plateaus at @xmath10=0 and 1 .    for @xmath39 , we have calculated the magnetization curves and the corresponding susceptibilities in the ground state , and collected all critical values of magnetic fields at which the susceptibility exhibits obvious singularities , which allows us for readily obtaining a global ground state phase diagram in @xmath40 plane for the spin-1 bahafc with a single - ion anisotropy @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "there are six phases , including the singlet - dimer ( sd ) phase , haldane phase , two tll phases separated by the @xmath11 magnetic plateau phase , and the spin fully polarized phase . at a critical bond alternating ratio @xmath41 , there exists a quantum phase transition from the gapped sd state into the gapped haldane phase .",

    "2(a ) for @xmath44 and 0.45 .",
    "three steps around @xmath45=0 , 1/2 and 1 in magnetic curves ( @xmath45 _ vs. _ @xmath15 ) are observed for @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding susceptibility @xmath47 is illustrated in the lower inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) , where one may notice that , due to the non - conservation of total @xmath48 , at these three steps @xmath47 does not exactly vanish although it is negligibly small .",
    "thus , we call these steps as quasi magnetic plateaus . in the regions between the quasi plateaus , @xmath46 has large values as shown in the upper inset of fig .",
    "the reason is that the existence of the single - ion anisotropy makes the spins tend to arrange in @xmath49 plane , and when the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath50 direction , the staggered magnetization @xmath46 is induced to form a canted ising order .",
    "in addition , for @xmath44 we observed from the upper inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) that with increasing @xmath15 the staggered magnetization @xmath46 first is negligible small , and then exhibits a sharp valley structure , which illustrates a reentrant behavior of the staggered magnetization @xcite . for @xmath32 ,",
    "only two steps appear in the magnetic curve , and the quasi @xmath11 step disappears . in this case , @xmath46 has even larger values in the region between the two steps . for other larger @xmath29 ,",
    "the magnetic curves in the transverse field @xmath15 have the behaviors similar to that of @xmath32 .    utilizing the method similar to fig .",
    "1(b ) and sweeping various values of @xmath29 , we can collect all critical magnetic fields by finding the singular positions of susceptibility , and then obtain the whole ground state phase diagram in @xmath51 plane for the system under investigation , as depicted in fig .",
    "it can be seen that there are five phases , namely , the sd , haldane , quasi @xmath11 magnetic plateau , z@xmath0 symmetry breaking ( or spin canted ) and the quasi spin polarized phases .",
    "the quantum critical point @xmath41 is recovered here .",
    "in contrast to the case under a longitudinal field where the @xmath11 plateau phase persists into the whole region of @xmath52 and separates two tll phases , the quasi @xmath11 plateau phase sets only in a small region ( @xmath53 ) . starting from the sd and haldane phases , when we increase the field @xmath15 , the gap is gradually closed at the phase boundaries . if one continues to increase the magnetic field @xmath15 , another gap opens because of the breaking of the discrete symmetry , giving rise to a z@xmath0 symmetry breaking phase , which displays a long range behavior .",
    "as a function of the number of kept states @xmath54 for different phases , where @xmath55 . ]    this present system demonstrates quite different behaviors in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields . to gain further insight into the underlying physics behind this character , we have studied the conformal anomalies of this system at the critical regimes . the conformal field theory ( cft )",
    "tells us that the conformal invariance at the critical point sets useful constraints on the critical behaviors of two - dimensional classical or 1d quantum systems @xcite , and the universality class can be characterized by the conformal anomaly or central charge @xmath56 of the virasoro algebra . for a system with a continuous symmetry",
    "@xmath57 , if g = su(n ) , the possible conformal central charge is given by @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "for the spin - s uniform antiferromagnetic quantum chains , g = su(2 ) , @xmath60 .",
    "for s=1/2 , @xmath1 ; s=1 , @xmath61 . for the present spin-1 bahafc with a single - ion anisotropy , the su(2 ) symmetry",
    "is not satisfied , and the conformal central charge should be calculated via other ways .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath9 , defined by @xmath62 offers a possible way to get the central charge of quantum spin chains , where @xmath63 is the reduced density matrix ( dm ) of system ( environment ) . in critical and noncritical regimes , the entanglement entropy has different asymptotic behaviors @xcite . in critical regimes ,",
    "the cft predicts @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath19 is the number of spins for a block embedding in an infinite chain , @xmath56 is the central charge and @xmath65 is a non - universal constant . in noncritical regimes ,",
    "@xmath9 vanishes for all l or grows monotonically with l until saturation . in the following",
    ", we shall invoke the itebd method to study the entanglement entropy for the case in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "because of the nearly unitary evolution , the itebd algorithm gives the canonical form of infinite matrix product states ( imps ) .",
    "we can make a schmidt decomposition on the ground state wave function such that @xmath66 on each bond , where @xmath67 is the orthonormalized basis states ( schmidt bases ) for two parts @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the infinite chain , and @xmath70 is the schmidt coefficient ( sc ) .",

    "the reason is that there does not have an excitation gap and the itebd algorithm can not project the right ground state wave function . in order to calculate the central charge in the tll phase ,",

    "[ fig - central - charge ] , where the fitting result gives the central charge @xmath1 in this tll phase @xcite .",
    "consequently , this implies that the critical behaviors of the spin-1 bahafc with a single - ion anisotropy in transverse fields quite differ from those in longitudinal fields , and the universality falls into two distinct classes with conformal central charges @xmath91 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of this system were explored by using recently proposed ltrg algorithm @xcite that allows for accurately calculating the thermodynamic quantities at very low temperature . in the following ltrg calculations we keep the trotter step @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig - mag - sus ] gives the temperature dependence of susceptibilities of the spin-1 bahafc in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields , where the fittings to the experimental data of ntenp under both fields are also included .",
    "one may see that the theoretical results are nicely fitted to the experimental data , generating a set of material parameters of ntenp : @xmath32 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",

    "the magnetization curves of ntenp were measured at t=1.3 k up to 700 koe in ref . [ ] , which are well fitted to our ltrg calculated results , giving the same set of fitting parameters as those obtained from the data of susceptibility except that @xmath97 here , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - mag - curv ] . considering that the two sets of experimental data from susceptibility and magnetic curves are independent",
    ", a slight difference on @xmath24 is reasonable .",
    "thus , @xmath24 of ntenp should be around 2.24 @xmath98 2.27 .",
    "the high - field magnetization curve is also well fitted with our ltrg results ( inset of fig .",
    "( [ fig - mag - curv ] ) ) using the same parameters .    .",
    "]      the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath99 of the s=1 bahafc in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields is obtained by the ltrg method down to very low temperatures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - spec - heat ] for @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in a transverse field , there are one round peak and a low temperature shoulder in @xmath99 , while in a longitudinal field the specific heat exhibits only one broad peak .",
    "it appears that at low temperature the specific heat displays distinct behaviors . to show this point clearly",
    ", we have carefully calculated the specific heat of this model at extremely low temperatures by the ltrg algorithm that is very powerful and efficient for calculating the low - temperature properties than other numerical methods @xcite .",
    "shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - spec - heat ] , two different behaviors in both fields at low temperature are clearly demonstrated , where in a longitudinal field , the specific heat displays a linear t - dependent character , showing a tll behavior , while in a transverse field , @xmath99 exhibits an exponential decay ( the fitting curve is given in the upper inset of fig . [ fig - spec - heat ] ) , that can be ascribed to the @xmath102 symmetry breaking with an open of an ising gap .     and the bond alternating ratio @xmath32 are taken . ]",
    "the specific heat @xmath99 of ntenp was also measured experimentally @xcite , where the linear t - dependence of @xmath99 at low temperature in a longitudinal field above the critical field @xmath103 t was observed , which was identified as a tll behavior .",
    "our low temperature ltrg calculations at @xmath100 ( @xmath104 ) on the s=1 bahafc model strongly supports this experimental observation . in a transverse field , the experiment on ntenp gives a distinct nonlinear low - temperature behavior of @xmath99 from that in a longitudinal field , which is also backed up by our ltrg results .",
    "we should remark here that the sharp peaks in the temperature dependent specific heat of ntenp were observed in both fields , which can not be explained by using this spin-1 bahafc model , as revealed by our present studies , because we do not find any field - dependent sharp peaks of @xmath99 in this 1d model .",
    "those sharp peaks may signal the field - induced long - range orders from the 3d effect of inter - chain interactions in ntenp .",
    "it is this reason that makes us not directly fit our ltrg results with the experimental data of specific heat of ntenp .",
    "nevertheless , our present studies on the spin-1 bahafc model may give a possible clue to understand the experimentally observed low - temperature sharp peaks of @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "in a longitudinal field , as long as the magnetic field is higher than the critical field ( @xmath105 ) , the system will enter the tll phase that has a quasi lro , and the true lro can be established only by interchain couplings . thus the peak position is almost determined by the strength of interchain interactions and hardly moves with the increase of the magnetic field . in a transverse field , in the range that the experiment was performed , the staggered magnetization that could enhance the interchain couplings increases monotonously with increasing the magnetic field , so the low - temperature sharp peak moves to the high temperature side with the increase of the transverse field .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the spin-1 bahafc model with a single - ion anisotropy in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields by employing the itebd and ltrg methods .",
    "the ground state phase diagrams in the plane of field versus the bond alternating ratio under both fields are obtained , where various phases are identified for two cases . from the entanglement entropy ,",
    "the conformal central charges in both critical longitudinal and transverse fields are determined to be @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , suggesting that the universality in critical regimes falls into different classes for both fields .",
    "the tll behavior at low @xmath106 observed experimentally in ntenp is verified via our accurate calculations , while an exponential decay of low - temperature specific heat is uncovered in a transverse field .",
    "the experimental data of the model material ntenp are well fitted with our ltrg results , and the parameters for characterizing ntenp are determined .",
