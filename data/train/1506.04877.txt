    "however , these approaches fail in the intermediate regime , and the only simple approach that provides a qualitatively correct description throughout is the bond - operator mean - field theory  @xcite .    in the presence of strong anisotropy ,",
    "as is the case in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , the excitation spectrum is always gapped ( fig .  [ fig1](e ) ) , and it is impossible to know just from the excitation spectrum in which regime the system lies .",
    "however , on general grounds the excitation spectrum of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2  revealed by rixs is incompatible with linear spin - wave theory .",
    "indeed linear spin - wave theory predicts two modes , which have dispersions related to each other by @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the in - plane momentum transfer ) , implying that the spectrum should be symmetric around @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , which is clearly not the case .",
    "we therefore developed a description of sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2  in terms of coupled dimers . in this approach ,",
    "the parameter that controls the center of the main band is the interlayer coupling @xmath4 , which must then be of the order of 100 mev .",
    "the fact that the dispersion is approximately degenerate at ( 1/2,1/2 ) points to a dominant intra - plane ferromagnetic diagonal inter - dimer coupling .",
    "finally , hund s rule exchange and the staggered rotation of the ir - o octahedra are known to induce anisotropic pseudo - dipolar and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions  @xcite .",

    "is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . in principle , due to the staggered rotation of iro@xmath40 octahedra , all bonds connecting opposite sublattices have anisotropic exchange contributions , but one can gauge away some of them@xcite , e.g. that on the interlayer coupling @xmath4 , which we have chosen to do .",
    "in single layer sr@xmath1iro@xmath7  the angle @xmath41 can be inferred directly from the canting of the in - plane ordered moment  @xcite . in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2  the moments order along the c - axis , and @xmath41 is a just a measure of the relative strength of the anisotropic interactions .",
    "this model has been treated using bond - operator mean - field theory introduced by sachdev and bhatt @xcite , which has proved to be an accurate method for many bilayer spin systems and was especially applied to spin ladder systems @xcite . in this formalism , first of all , a close - packed dimerization of the lattice is chosen . in the case of our bilayer system , we designate interlayer bonds on the sites @xmath42 , where the first coordinate refers to the layer and the second one to the position inside the layer .",
    "the four states @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 on each rung @xmath47 in the hilbert space can be combined to form one singlet state @xmath48 and three triplet states @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "to do so , singlet and triplet creation operators that create the states out of the vacuum @xmath51 are introduced @xmath52 on each rung , the operators must fulfill a local hard - core constraint @xmath53 .",
    "the action of the spin operators on the singlet and triplet states is then equivalent to @xmath54      to implement the mean - field approximation , one has to make assumptions about the ground state .",

    "when anisotropy in spin space becomes important , as in systems with strong spin - orbit coupling such as sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , a new paradigm arises where the quantum critical point is replaced by a simple transition between a gapped antiferromagnet and a gapped quantum dimer system , as sketched in fig .",

    "<S> our results contrast with those of an earlier study which reported the existence of a single dominant branch . while these earlier results were interpreted as two overlapping modes within a spin - wave model of weakly coupled iridium - oxide planes , our results are more reminiscent of those expected for a system of weakly coupled dimers . in this latter approach </S>",
    "<S> the lower and higher energy modes find a natural explanation as those corresponding to transverse and longitudinal fluctuations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore developed a bond - operator theory which describes the magnetic dispersion in sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2  in terms of quantum dimer excitations . in our model dimerisation </S>",
    "<S> is produced by the leading heisenberg exchange , @xmath4 , which couples iridium ions in adjacent planes of the bilayer . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian also includes in plane exchange , @xmath5 , as well as further neighbour couplings and relevant anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> the bond - operator theory provides an excellent account of the dispersion of both modes , while the measured @xmath3 dependence of the rixs intensities is in reasonable qualitative accord with the spin - spin correlation function calculated from the theory . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results in the context of the quantum criticality of bilayer dimer systems in the presence of anisotropic interactions derived from strong spin - orbit coupling . </S>"
