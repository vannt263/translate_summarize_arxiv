    "according to the standard theory of planet formation , planets form from planetesimals , which are kilometer - sized solid bodies . however , the process of planetesimal formation is still controversial .",
    "the inward migration of meter - sized bodies due to gas drag is very rapid ; its timescale is only @xmath4 yr @xcite .",
    "the growth of dust to planetesimals due to particle adhering seems difficult in the standard disk model .",
    "the gravitational instability scenario is an alternative scenario for this stage @xcite .",
    "dust particles settle into the midplane of a protoplanetary disk owing to the gravitational force from the central star if the gas flow is laminar . as the sedimentation of dust particles proceeds , the density at the midplane exceeds the critical density and the dust layer finally becomes gravitationally unstable .",
    "the gravitationally unstable dust layer rapidly collapses by its self - gravity , forming km - sized planetesimals @xcite . the rapid migration of meter - sized bodies can be avoided because the timescale of the gravitational instability is only on the order of a kepler period .",
    "however , the gravitational instability scenario has a critical issue . as the sedimentation of dust grains toward the midplane proceeds , the vertical velocity shear increases and gives rise to the kelvin - helmholtz instability , which makes the dust layer turbulent .",
    "the turbulence prevents dust particles from settling .",
    "a lot of studies have been carried out on this issue @xcite .",
    "however , problems concerning the gravitational instability still remain unsettled .",
    "although many studies have been conducted on the condition of gravitational instability or its linear regime , there has been little study of the nonlinear regime of gravitational instability .",
    "here we concentrate on the formation process of planetesimals assuming the gravitational instability .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations of a gravitationally unstable particle disk . in their simulation ,",
    "the optical depth is very small , and the particle disk is unstable , even initially .",
    "if we consider the formation of planetesimals through gravitational instability at @xmath5 , the optical depth is high , and the initial velocity dispersion must be large owing to turbulent flow driven by the kelvin - helmholtz instability or magnetorotational instability @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we will take a close look at initially stable disks with large optical depth . @xcite performed simulations using a code that solves the magnetohydrodynamic equations with a three - dimensional grid and includes particles with self - gravity .",
    "they mapped the particle density on the grid and solved the poisson equation using a fast fourier transform method .",
    "they included collisions among particles as damping the velocity dispersion of the particles within each grid .",
    "they found that particles collapse in an overdense region in the midplane and the gravitationally bound objects form with masses comparable to dwarf planets .",
    "@xcite performed a set of simulations in the self - gravitating collision - dominated particle disks without gas components ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the point - to - point newtonian mutual interaction was calculated directly .",
    "they adopted the hard and soft sphere models as collision models , and examined parameter dependencies on the size of computational domain , restitution coefficient , optical depth , hill radius of particles , and the duration of collision . in the hard sphere model ,",
    "penetration between particles is not possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the velocity changes in an instant at collisions . in the soft sphere model",
    ", particles can overlap if they are in contact ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "they found that the formation process of planetesimals is qualitatively independent of simulation parameters if initial toomre s @xmath6 value , @xmath7 .",
    "the formation process is divided into three stages : the formation of non - axisymmetric wake - like structures @xcite , the creation of aggregates , and the rapid collisional growth of the aggregates .",
    "the mass of the largest aggregates is larger than the mass predicted by the linear perturbation theory ( hereafter linear mass @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "however @xcite could not find the saturation of the growth of the planetesimals in paper i. the mass of the planetesimal formed in the simulation depends on the size of the computational domain .",
    "almost all mass in the computational domain is absorbed by a single planetesimal , and thus the mass of the planetesimal is determined by the total mass in the computational domain .    in this paper",
    ", we use the alternative model of collisions , ` accretion model ' . in physical terms",
    ", the accretion model corresponds to the more dissipative model than the hard and soft sphere models . in the accretion model , when two particles collide , if the binding condition is satisfied , the two particles are merged into one particle .",
    "efficient energy dissipation occurs when two particles merge into one particle . in the soft and hard sphere models ,",
    "since large aggregates consist of a lot of small particles and the number of particles does not decrease , the calculation is time - consuming .",
    "if we are not interested in internal states of planetesimals such as rotation or internal density profile , we can treat a large aggregate as one large particle .",
    "we expect that the final mass or spatial distribution of planetesimals can be estimated by the accretion model .",
    "the accretion model has an advantage from the viewpoint of calculation .",
    "the number of particles decreases as the calculation proceeds ; thereby this model enables us to perform simulations of larger numbers of particles than that in the previous work . taking this advantage",
    ", we can examine the large computational domains .    in this study",
    ", we neglect the effect of gas for the sake of simplicity .",
    "as many authors investigated , the effect of gas is very important .",
    "the solid particles drift radially due to gas drag @xcite , gas friction helps gravitational collapse @xcite , gas turbulence prevents and helps concentration of solids @xcite , and clumps of solid particles form due to streaming instability @xcite .",
    "but once gravitational instability happens and large aggregates form , as a first step , we may be able to neglect gas drag because they are so large that they decouple from gas .",
    "therefore our gas - free model may be applicable to the stages of gravitational instability and subsequent collisional growth . in section [ sec : method ] , we explain the simulation method .",
    "our results are presented in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "we compare the accretion model with the soft and hard sphere models and investigate the models of large computational domain . in section [ sec : summary ] , we summarize the results .",

    "the growth of planetesimals continues until most of the mass in the computational domain is absorbed by the largest planetesimal .",
    "we expect to find the saturation of growth because the accretion model enables us to perform a wider simulation with a large number of particles .",
    "first we assume that the ratio of the length of the computational domain in the @xmath10-direction to the @xmath11-direction is unity , in other words , the shape of the computational domain is a square .",

    "the shape of the computational domain is rectangular .",
    "we vary the length in the @xmath11-direction , @xmath68 , from 3 to 24 fixing the length in the @xmath10-direction , @xmath66 , ( the left panel in figure [ fig : gi2dep_x_dir_all.eps ] ) ( models 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ) , and we vary @xmath66 from 3 to 24 fixing @xmath68 ( the right panel in figure [ fig : gi2dep_x_dir_all.eps ] ) ( models 14 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ) .",

    "@xmath6 value increases with @xmath68 because of the scattering of field particles by the large bodies .",

    "here we estimate the final mass of a planetesimal , @xmath175 , in the computational domain in a similar way to estimate the isolation mass of protoplanets in the oligarchic growth picture @xcite .",
    "we assume that particles whose orbital radii are within @xmath176 of the planetesimal are finally absorbed by the planetesimal though they are not in the hill sphere of the planetesimal initially , where @xmath177 is a non - dimensional factor and @xmath178 is the hill radius of the planetesimal .",
    "therefore , the planetesimal absorbs particles in the rectangle of @xmath179 in width and @xmath2 in length .",
    "the hill radius of the planetesimal is @xmath180 , and we define @xmath181 the planetesimal with the mass @xmath175 can absorb the mass @xmath182 , and @xmath182 increases as the planetesimal grows .",
    "when @xmath183 , the growth becomes slow .",
    "we estimate the mass of the planetesimal by this condition . in this case",
    "the number of planetesimals is about @xmath184 .",
    "we obtained the mass of the planetesimal @xmath185 where @xmath186 are the total mass in the computational domain .",
    "the number of the planetesimals is @xmath187 is @xmath188 the mass of the planetesimals is equal to the total mass in the computational domain and the number of the planetesimal is unity if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath189    the comparisons between the analytical estimation and the simulations are shown in figures [ fig : plamax.eps ] and [ fig : plamaxxy.eps ] . if we assume @xmath190 , the analytical estimation agrees with the simulation results .",
    "the parameter @xmath190 indicates that the mean orbital separation of planetesimals is @xmath191 .",
    "this is narrower than @xmath192 , which is the typical orbital separation of protoplanets caused by oligarchic growth @xcite .",
    "this narrow orbital separation is possible for a dissipative system .",
    "we will discuss this issue later .",
    "for instance , figure [ figz.eps ] shows the final state in model 18 . in this figure , there are 9 planetesimals in the computational domain whose length in the @xmath10-direction is @xmath193",
    ". thus the mean orbital separation is about @xmath194 .",
    "the hill radius of the mean planetesimal ( @xmath195 ) is about @xmath196 .",
    "therefore the separation is estimated to about @xmath197 , which is consistent with figure [ figz.eps ] .",
    "our analytical estimation gives good agreement with the numerical results in each model .",
    "figure [ fig : plamax.eps ] shows the mean mass and the number of planetesimals as a function of the size of the computational domain in the model where the domain is square .",
    "the mean mass of planetesimals increases with the size of the computational domain . from the equation ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) , when @xmath198 , the number of planetesimals is equal to unity and the mass of the planetesimal is approximately equal to the total mass in the computational domain .",
    "the slope of the line of the mean mass of planetesimals changes at @xmath199 and the number of the planetesimals is larger than unity if @xmath200 .",
    "figure [ fig : plamaxxy.eps ] shows the result for the model of the rectangular computational domain . in the models of @xmath201 ,",
    "the mean mass of planetesimals is constant and the number of planetesimals is larger than unity if @xmath202 . in the models of @xmath203 ,",
    "the slopes of the lines change at @xmath204 .",
    "the growth of planetesimals can not be saturated although @xmath68 is large . in these models ,",
    "the hill radius of the planetesimal is longer than the size of the computational domain in the @xmath10-direction . the only one planetesimal forms , and",
    "it absorbs most mass in the computational domain .",
    "it should be remembered that the local calculation of planetesimal formation has the domain - size dependence .    if we assume that the surface density of dust is @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a scaling factor , the linear mass @xmath8 is given by @xmath207 and from equation ( [ eq : planetesimal_mass ] ) the estimated planetesimal mass @xmath175 is given by @xmath208 where we assume @xmath209 .",
    "the factor @xmath210 roughly corresponds to the minimum mass solar nebula model inside the snow line @xcite . from equation ( [ eq : planetesimalmass ] ) , the estimated planetesimal mass becomes larger than the linear mass if the feeding zone is large , @xmath211 .",
    "the estimated and linear masses exhibit the same dependencies on @xmath206 , @xmath13 , and @xmath23 , and the estimated planetesimal mass is on the same order of the linear mass when @xmath212 .",
    "these results are explained as follows .",
    "here we rewrite the hill radius by the most unstable wavelength : @xmath213 where the most unstable wavelength for @xmath137 is @xmath214 the most unstable wavelength of the gravitational instability and the hill radius of the linear mass are on the same order .",
    "the condition @xmath137 corresponds to the balance between the self - gravity and the effect of the rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "the hill radius is determined by the balance between the self - gravity and the tidal force .",
    "thus , @xmath178 and @xmath215 are on the same order , and the planetesimal mass is on the order of the linear mass only if @xmath212 . in general , because @xmath216 , the planetesimal mass is larger than the linear mass",
    ".    collisions among planetesimals are more frequent than the realistic case in the present simulations since the bulk density of super - particle is much smaller than the realistic value .",
    "therefore the orbital separation of large planetesimals is different from that of the standard oligarchic growth derived by @xmath0-body simulations of planetesimals @xcite .",
    "if the number density is low , the orbital separation is determined by the balance between the orbital repulsion and their growth @xcite .",
    "but if the number density is high , and the collisional dissipation is effective , the orbital repulsion is relatively weak . thus , in the collisional oligarchic growth , the orbital separation can be narrower than @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "we performed local @xmath0-body simulations of planetesimal formation through gravitational instability and collisional growth without a gas component using a shearing box method .",
    "the accretion model was adopted as the collision model . in the accretion model , when particles collide , if the binding condition is satisfied , two particles merge into one .",
    "the number of particles decreases as the calculation proceeds , thus this model enables us to perform the long - term and large - scale calculations .",
    "we compared the results of the accretion model with those of the hard and soft sphere models used in paper i.    the formation process of planetesimals is the same as that of the hard and soft sphere models .",
    "it is divided into three stages : the formation of non - axisymmetric structures , the creation of planetesimal seeds , and the collisional growth of the planetesimals .",
    "the velocity dispersion of particles decreases gradually due to the inelastic collisions .",
    "the gravitational instability occurs when the velocity dispersion of particles becomes a critical value determined by @xmath218 .",
    "the non - axisymmetric structures form and fragment into planetesimal seeds , the masses of which are on the order of the linear mass . in this paper",
    ", we consider the formation of non - axisymmetric structures and planetesimal seeds as gravitational instability .",
    "planetesimal seeds grow rapidly by coagulation and the large planetesimals form . most of the mass in the computational domain is absorbed by a few large planetesimals .",
    "we studied the effect of physical parameters on planetesimal formation : the restitution coefficient @xmath28 , the initial optical depth @xmath51 , the dependence of planetesimal formation on the ratio @xmath219 , and the initial toomre s @xmath6 value .",
    "we found no qualitative differences among the collision models . in the accretion model ,",
    "the merged particles can not split , thus the growth of particles is more efficient than in the hard and soft sphere models .",
    "if the restitution coefficient @xmath28 is smaller than the critical value , the time evolution is similar to the standard model .",
    "if @xmath51 is large , the collision frequency is high , and the dissipation of the kinetic energy is efficient .",
    "thus , the gravitational instability occurs more quickly for larger @xmath51 . in this narrow parameter range @xmath220",
    ", there is no remarkable dependence on @xmath56 .    by the long - term and large - scale calculations using the accretion model",
    ", we found that the mean mass of the planetesimals depends on the size of the computational domain .",
    "we found that the mean mass of planetesimals is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "however , this mass is independent of @xmath3 if @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "the mean mass of planetesimals is estimated by equation ( [ eq : planetesimal_mass ] ) .",
    "large planetesimals sweep small planetesimals in the rotational direction .",
    "if the orbital separation of planetesimals is sufficiently large , the planetesimals can not collide .",
    "the typical orbital separation is about @xmath191 in the present simulation the dependence of the planetesimal mass on the size of the computational domain indicates that we can not simply discuss the realistic mass of the planetesimal using the local calculation .",
    "the effect of gas was neglected in our simulation in order to study the physical process of gravitational instability of dust particles and subsequent collisional evolution as a first step .",
    "once gravitational instability happens and large aggregates form , we may be able to neglect gas drag because they are so large that they decouple from gas .",
    "so our gas - free model may be applicable to the stages of gravitational instability and subsequent collisional growth .",
    "the simple gas - free model provides thorough understanding of the gravitational instability and collisional growth of planetesimals .",
    "however , it is necessary to include gas drag so as to investigate the realistic formation process of planetesimals since the stopping time of small dust particles is shorter than the kepler time .",
    "we will investigate the gravitational instability of a particle disk embedded in a laminar gaseous disk in the next paper ."
