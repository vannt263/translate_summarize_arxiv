    "the reduction of mechanical control systems to kinematic systems is very interesting and useful for solving control problems such as optimal control problems @xcite and for designing suitable control laws ( see @xcite , chapter 8 in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for instance , the planning motion for the associated kinematic system determines trajectories of the mechanical control system .",
    "thus the methodologies to find these trajectories have been simplified because the kinematic reduction gives rise to a first - order control - linear system defined on the configuration manifold .",
    "hence in general it is easier to solve or to analyze the kinematic system . if the mechanical control system is reducible to a kinematic one , then the controlled trajectories of this kinematic system under reparametrization define solutions of the original second - order problem on the phase space .",
    "an interesting particular case is the one defined by kinematic reductions of order @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of reductions define a decoupling vector field .",
    "unfortunately , there is not a systematic procedure for finding such kinematic reductions .",
    "the philosophy of kinematic reductions of order 1 seems , in a first approach , quite similar to the standard hamilton - jacobi theory .",
    "this theory , that appeared with the dawn of analytical mechanics , is a valuable tool for the exact integration of hamilton s equations , for instance using the technique of separation of variables ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in many cases ,",
    "the hamilton - jacobi theory allows us to simplify the integration of hamilton s equations or , at least , to find some particular solutions . to be more precise ,",
    "consider a configuration manifold @xmath1 and a hamiltonian function @xmath2 .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi equation can be written as @xmath3 for some function @xmath4 .",
    "if we find such a function @xmath5 , then the integration of the associated hamilton s equations ( with initial conditions along @xmath6 ) is reduced to knowing the integral curves of a vector field @xmath7 on @xmath1 .",
    "this vector field is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the canonical projection and @xmath10 is the hamiltonian vector field associated to @xmath11 .",
    "hence , from the integration of a vector field on the configuration space it is possible to recover some of the solutions of the original hamiltonian system .",
    "recent developments in hamilton - jacobi theory are described in @xcite .",
    "of course , the possible similarities with the theory of kinematic reductions are now clearer .",
    "one of the main objectives in our paper is to carefully study the underlying geometry of the kinematic reduction theory by showing the close relation with the classical hamilton - jacobi theory .",
    "moreover , advantage of recent developments in hamilton - jacobi theory for nonholonomic systems on skew - symmetric algebroids @xcite even with external forces will be really useful to obtain a full novel theory of kinematic reduction for this type of systems .",
    "it is important to highlight this is not an arbitrary generalization since the mechanics on algebroids @xcite is particularly relevant for the class of lagrangian systems invariant under the action of a lie group of symmetries including as a particular case nonholonomic dynamics ( see @xcite for a survey on the subject ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarized in the following points :    * a description of nonholonomic mechanics in terms of the levi - civita connection associated to a fibered riemannian metric defined on the vector subbundle determined by the nonholonomic constraints . * a deduction of the hamilton - jacobi equation for nonholonomic systems in terms of the induced levi - civita connection . *",
    "an affine connection approach in presence of control forces . * a description of hamilton - jacobi equation with controls .",
    "* relationship between hamilton - jacobi equation and kinematic reductions by decoupling vector fields .",
    "it is interesting to observe that our approach allows us to extend the theory of kinematic reduction to controlled system with symmetries as for instance , nonholonomic lagrange - poincar equations , etc .    in the sequel ,",
    "all the manifolds are real , second countable and @xmath12 .",
    "the maps are assumed to be also @xmath12 .",
    "sum over all repeated indices is understood .",
    "in this section we introduce the notion of a skew - symmetric algebroid on a vector bundle @xmath13 .",
    "it is known that this geometric structure covers many interesting cases in mechanics , as for instance , nonholonomic mechanics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similarly to the intrinsic definition of the euler - lagrange equations for a lagrangian function @xmath14 obtained by the canonical structures on it ( standard lie bracket , exterior differential ... ) , it is possible to determine the motion equations for a lagrangian @xmath15 using the differential geometric structures naturally induced by the skew - symmetric algebroid structure .",
