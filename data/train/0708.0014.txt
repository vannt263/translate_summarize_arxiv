    "<S> the design of a 671 nm diode laser with a mode - hop - free tuning range of 40 ghz is described . </S>",
    "<S> this long tuning range is achieved by simultaneously ramping the external cavity length with the laser injection current . </S>",
    "<S> the external cavity consists of a microscope cover slip mounted on piezoelectric actuators . </S>",
    "<S> in such a configuration the laser output pointing remains fixed , independent of its frequency . using a diode with an output power of 5 - 7 mw </S>",
    "<S> , the laser linewidth was found to be smaller than 30 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> this cover slip cavity and feedforward laser current control system is simple , economical , robust , and easy to use for spectroscopy , as we demonstrate with lithium vapor and lithium atom beam experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> external cavities are often used to control the frequency of a laser . </S>",
    "<S> early investigations with a plane mirror reflecting light back into a laser ( the design in figure 1 ) showed that optical feedback can  pull \" the laser frequency and influence which laser - cavity mode is active @xcite . instead of a mirror a reflective grating </S>",
    "<S> can be used , as in the popular littrow @xcite or littman - metcalf @xcite configurations with diode lasers . however , scanning the cavity alone offers a limited mode - hop - free tuning range with red diode lasers . </S>",
    "<S> this was reported by @xcite , and confirmed in our laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> we found that 2 ghz was the maximum single - mode tuning range we could achieve when using only optical feedback to control the frequency of a 671 nm diode laser . </S>",
    "<S> we tried seven different diode laser models @xcite , and found the same limited tuning range with either a grating or a mirror forming the external cavity . </S>",
    "<S> adjusting only the diode laser current also resulted in a limited ( 2 - 3 ghz ) mode - hop - free tuning range . </S>",
    "<S> this scan range is limited by the overlap of the modes for the laser diode and external cavity . a substantial increase in the tuning range </S>",
    "<S> was caused by modulating _ both _ the external cavity and the diode laser current together .        </S>",
    "<S> here we describe a diode laser system in which the laser current and the external cavity length are simultaneously ramped to achieve a 40 ghz mode - hop - free tuning range operating near the lithium atom 2s-2p transition wavelength of 671 nm . </S>",
    "<S> a microscope cover slip mounted on a piezoelectric transducer serves as the external cavity and output coupler , hence we refer to this as a _ </S>",
    "<S> cover slip cavity _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . surprisingly , the modest reflectivity of the glass cover slip surface with no coating ( r @xmath0% ) is sufficient to force single - mode operation while the laser frequency scans continuously over 40 ghz . since either end of this mode - hop - free tuning range </S>",
    "<S> can be extended by adding ( or subtracting ) an offset to the cavity length , this mode - hop - free tuning range appears to be limited by non - linearity in the required diode laser current or cavity length adjustments .    </S>",
    "<S> it was found empirically that the laser current affects the frequency with the slope for the sanyo model dl3149 - 057 diode laser . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity length affects the frequency with the slope . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the relationship @xmath1 for our cavity ( length @xmath210 mm ) and red light ( @xmath3=447 thz ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as the cavity length increases by 22 nm , the laser current should be increased by 250 @xmath4a to anticipate the -1 ghz shift in laser frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this `` feedforward '' procedure increases the tuning range of the cover slip cavity laser . as a feedforward system </S>",
    "<S> , there is no feedback loop connecting the laser current and cavity length adjustments ; they are just commensurately scanned in a predictable fashion using analog electronics . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the laser mounting block was also stabilized to within 0.1   because temperature was seen to affect the laser frequency with the slope @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> = -0.03/ghz ( i.e. a wavelength shift of 1 nm per 20 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the laser current is modulated by an input voltage @xmath6 that can be provided by a function generator . </S>",
    "<S> a resistor in series with the laser keeps the current linearly related to the input voltage [ @xmath7 to first order above the diode knee ] . </S>",
    "<S> the same input voltage is also used to control the cavity length . to accomplish this , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 is added to an offset ( @xmath8 ) , amplified with a gain factor @xmath9 , and then directly applied to the piezoelectric actuators to adjust the cover slip cavity length . </S>",
    "<S> hence the cavity length [ @xmath10 is also linearly related to the input voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the length - to - voltage multiplier ( @xmath11=4 @xmath4m/150 v ) of the piezoelectric actuators @xcite makes the required piezo - voltage to laser current slope -3.3v / ma for mode - hop - free laser scanning as illustrated in figure 2 .    ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same voltage is shifted ( by adding @xmath8 ) then amplified by gain ( g ) and applied to the piezoelectric actuator ( p ) . </S>",
    "<S> not shown : laser protection circuitry . </S>",
    "<S> ( right ) the predicted linear relation between the laser current and the cavity actuator voltage and the resulting shift in laser frequency . </S>",
    "<S> ( the laser frequency is centered on 447,000 ghz for the wavelength 671 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinearities in the laser current as a function of @xmath6 , nonlinearities in the piezo - voltage as a function of @xmath6 or nonlinearities in the relationship of these quantities to laser frequency limit the mode - hop - free scan range of the system.,title=\"fig:\",width=408 ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> this was also used to enhance the tuning range for the various diode laser systems which utilized an external cavity grating @xcite . however , our cover slip cavity with feedforward current control has the advantages of simplicity , economy , and stability . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss these advantages after explaining the mechanical construction .    </S>",
    "<S> mechanical views of the cover slip cavity , collimating optics , and temperature - stabilized laser mount are shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the physical layout has two principle parts : a mounting block , and a kinematic mount . </S>",
    "<S> the laser diode is mounted in a 0.6-diameter tube with collimating optics @xcite and the tube is clamped in a 2x1x1 aluminum block pictured in figure [ layout ] . a temperature sensor ( ad590 ) and heaters ( a 5 ohm resistor and 2 transistors ) </S>",
    "<S> are also mounted on the block .    </S>",
    "<S> the stock 1-square kinematic mount @xcite is disassembled and a 0.7-square hole is milled in one plate ( as shown in figure 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a 0.3-diameter hole is drilled in the other plate to transmit the output beam . </S>",
    "<S> two piezoelectric actuators are mounted on either side of this output hole , and a 0.5 diameter glass cover slip is attached to the actuators with epoxy . </S>",
    "<S> the cover slip is thus positioned within the kinematic mount so that it can form a short external cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic mount is attached to the aluminum block with epoxy so that the cover slip and output hole are centered on the laser beam . </S>",
    "<S> the mount enables coarse alignment of the cover slip after the initial construction . during feedforward operation , the system s only moving parts are the cover slip and the piezoelectric actuators </S>",
    "<S> . the cavity length can be coarsely adjusted ( from 10 mm to 20 mm ) by relocating the collimating tube , and with care the kinematic mount can be taken apart ( to replace the cover slip ) and reassembled while the plate with the 0.7 hole remains attached to the mounting block .    </S>",
    "<S> the block and cavity assembly is mounted on a standard optics post and positioned in a thermally stable enclosure ( with a hole for the output beam ) . </S>",
    "<S> to reduce vibrations , the entire system is mounted on a 1 kg brass plate and placed on top of sorbathane pads .        </S>",
    "<S> one advantage of the cover - slip cavity is simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> if a grating were used for the external cavity there are two mechanical design criteria that must be considered because both the cavity length as well as the grating angle affect the laser frequency . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> our cover slip cavity has only one important dimension : cavity length . </S>",
    "<S> the laser beam always points in the same direction with the cover slip cavity ( whereas some grating cavities shift the beam direction as the frequency is scanned ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cover slip transmits @xmath12 of the laser beam so it offers a high output efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we avoided anti - reflection coating the diode ( as was done in @xcite ) , we avoided removing the diode can ( which has glass surfaces ) and we avoided coating either side of the cover slip ( either to increase or decrease reflectivity ) in order to keep the design simple . </S>",
    "<S> the entire laser system was constructed from parts that cost $ 1500 , and a lithium heat - pipe vapor cell was constructed for a cost of $ 800 . </S>",
    "<S> the parts are listed in appendix i.    if the temperature of the mounting block drifts by even 0.1   then the offset voltage @xmath8 needs to be adjusted , but this is the only intervention needed to keep the system scanning across the lithium atom resonance features for days at a time . </S>",
    "<S> this stability and long tuning range makes the red light particularly useful for instructional laboratories and atomic physics research . </S>",
    "<S> we operated individual sanyo dl3149 - 057 lasers for over 6 months with the current ramping in the range 35 to 45 ma . </S>",
    "<S> the laser is typically scanned by applying a triangle waveform to @xmath6 that varies from 8 to 10 volts and cycles at 100 hz . </S>",
    "<S> for some applications we also locked the laser frequency to a saturated absorption feature by connecting @xmath6 to the output of a locking circuit .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of experiments were done to test the performance of the cover slip cavity system . </S>",
    "<S> lithium atom absorption spectra demonstrating a 40-ghz mode - hop - free frequency scan are shown in figure 4 . the vapor cell absorption features ( fig 4 upper left ) each have a 3 ghz doppler width due to thermal motion of the lithium atoms . in this plot , </S>",
    "<S> data are shown ( lower left ) for two vapor cell temperatures with correspondingly different optical depths . </S>",
    "<S> the flat - bottomed absorption features with the higher optical depth allowed us to measure the amount of off - mode light in the laser output beam . </S>",
    "<S> this was seen to be 7 @xmath13 2 % . </S>",
    "<S> the laser intensity is modulated from 5 to 7 mw in accord with the laser current , but the laser beam pointing remains stable during the scan . </S>",
    "<S> a fabry - perot transmission spectrum is shown in figure 4 ( lower left ) confirming the scanning range of 40 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> saturated absorption spectra shown in figure 4 ( upper right ) were obtained using the two - probe method described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also shown is an atom beam deflection signal ( bottom right ) obtained by shining the cover slip cavity laser beam at a highly collimated atom beam . </S>",
    "<S> ( see @xcite for a description of this technique ) . </S>",
    "<S> both types of doppler - free spectra show the large 803 mhz hyperfine splitting due to the f=1,2 levels of the ground @xmath14 state of @xmath15li . </S>",
    "<S> the atom beam deflection spectrum also shows a smaller but clearly resolved splitting due to the f=1,2 levels in the excited @xmath16 state of @xmath15li .     </S>",
    "<S> radians , the deflection spectrum has essentially zero doppler width . </S>",
    "<S> power broadening , transit time broadening , and the laser linewidth all contribute to the four observed 55-mhz ( fwhm ) dips due to deflection . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the 803 mhz spacing due to the ground state hyperfine splitting , the atom beam deflection signal shows the 92 mhz hyperfine splitting due to the @xmath16 excited state of @xmath15li.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   radians , the deflection spectrum has essentially zero doppler width . </S>",
    "<S> power broadening , transit time broadening , and the laser linewidth all contribute to the four observed 55-mhz ( fwhm ) dips due to deflection . in addition to the 803 mhz spacing due to the ground state hyperfine splitting , the atom beam deflection signal shows the 92 mhz hyperfine splitting due to the @xmath16 excited state of @xmath15li.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   radians , the deflection spectrum has essentially zero doppler width . </S>",

    "<S> this upper limit on the linewidth is consistent with the atomic deflection spectra and the saturated absorption spectra shown in figure [ 4fig ] . in additional tests we modulated the laser current at 800 mhz ( to add sidebands to the laser spectrum ) as described in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> this did not reduce the tuning range . </S>",
    "<S> we also used this laser to study faraday rotation in vapor @xcite , the hanle effect in vapor @xcite , and optical pumping of an atom beam . </S>",
    "<S> we thus demonstrated that the cover slip cavity diode laser serves for several atomic physics experiments .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have described a diode laser system that uses a cover slip cavity and feedforward operation to achieve a mode - hop - free scanning range of 40 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency can be scanned over the lithium atom 2s-2p resonances near 671 nm , with the entire system being simple , economical , stable and robust . </S>"
