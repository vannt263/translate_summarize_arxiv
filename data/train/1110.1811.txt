    "the sugeno integral ( introduced by sugeno  @xcite ) remains as one of the most noteworthy aggregation functions , and this is partially due to the fact that it provides a meaningful way to fuse or merge values within universes where essentially no structure , other than an order , is assumed . even though primarily defined over real intervals , the concept of sugeno integral can be extended to wider domains , namely , distributive lattices , via the notion of lattice polynomial function ( i.e. , a combination of variables and constants using the lattice operations @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) . as it turned out ,",
    "idempotent lattice polynomial functions coincide with ( discrete ) sugeno integrals ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the sugeno integral has been generalized via the notion of quasi - polynomial function ( see @xcite ) originally defined as a mapping @xmath10   on a bounded chain @xmath11 and which can be factorized as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a polynomial function and @xmath14 is an order - preserving map .",
    "this notion was later extended in two ways .    in @xcite ,",
    "the input and output universes were allowed to be arbitrary , possibly different , bounded distributive lattices @xmath11 and @xmath2 so that   @xmath15 is factorizable as in ( [ eq : quasi1 ] ) , where now @xmath16 and @xmath17 . these functions appear naturally within the scope of decision making under uncertainty since they subsume overall preference functionals associated with sugeno integrals whose variables are transformed by the utility function @xmath18 .",
    "several axiomatizations for this function class were proposed , as well as all possible factorizations described .    in @xcite and @xcite",
    "a different extension was considered , now appearing within the realm of multicriteria decision making .",
    "essentially , the aggregation model was based on functions @xmath0 for bounded chains @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which can be factorized as compositions @xmath19 where @xmath16 is a sugeno integral , and each @xmath20 is an order - preserving map .",
    "such functions were referred to as sugeno utility functions in @xcite .",
    "pseudo - polynomial functions were defined as functions of the form ( [ eq : pseudo1 ] ) , where @xmath4 is an arbitrary ( possibly non - idempotent ) lattice polynomial function , and each @xmath6 satisfies a certain boundary condition ( which is weaker than order - preservation ) .",
    "note that every quasi - polynomial function ( [ eq : quasi1 ] ) can be regarded as a pseudo - polynomial function , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , pseudo - polynomial functions naturally subsume sugeno utility functions , and  several axiomatizations were established for this function class in @xcite .",
    "the question of factorizing a given sugeno utility function into a composition ( [ eq : pseudo1 ] ) was addressed in @xcite , where a method for producing such a factorization was presented .    in the current paper",
    "we extend the previous results by letting @xmath1 to be arbitrary sets and @xmath2 to be an arbitrary finite distributive lattice , thus subsuming the frameworks in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we develop general tools which allow us to produce all possible factorizations of a given pseudo - polynomial function into compositions ( [ eq : pseudo1 ] ) of a lattice polynomial function @xmath23 with maps @xmath24 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sect preliminaries ]",
    "we introduce the basic notions and terminology needed throughout the paper , and recall some preliminary results . for further background on aggregation functions and their use in decision",
    "making , we refer the reader to @xcite ; for basics in the theory of lattices , see @xcite . in section  [ sect characterization ]",
    "we develop a general framework used to derive an axiomatization of pseudo - polynomial functions of somewhat different nature than those proposed in  @xcite , and which will provide tools for determining all possible factorizations of given pseudo - polynomial functions in section  [ sect factorization ] .",
    "these results are then illustrated in section  [ sect example ] by means of a concrete example , and in section  [ sect chains ] we show how this new procedure can be applied to derive the algorithm provided in @xcite .",
