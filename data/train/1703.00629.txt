    "it is believed that the formation of galaxies in dark matter halos led to emission of uv radiation that gradually ionized the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the igm is almost fully ionized at lower redshifts , and nearly all the neutral hydrogen in the universe is to be found in the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies .",
    "this allows us to model the distribution of neutral gas in terms of assignment schemes that apportion the neutral gas in halos of dark matter .",
    "such a model can then be constrained by observations of damped lyman @xmath7 systems ( dlas ) seen as strong absorption in the spectra of quasars at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the observations of dlas indicate that at redshifts @xmath8 , the neutral hydrogen content of the universe is almost constant with a density parameter @xmath9 .",
    "clustering of dlas has been used to constrain the _",
    "bias _ for these objects @xcite and it appears that these objects are strongly clustered when compared with the matter distribution at these redshifts .",
    "several upcoming radio telescopes can be used to detect neutral hydrogen at high redshifts using the redshifted @xmath0  cm radiation using intensity mapping @xcite .",
    "the focus of the present study is at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "a number of telescopes can potentially detect redshifted @xmath0  cm from neutral hydrogen at high redshifts : gmrt ( giant meterwave radio telescope ) , ugmrt ( upgraded gmrt ) , owfa ( ooty wide field array ) , mwa ( murchison widefield array ) , chime ( canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment ) and ska - low .",
    "the focus of the present study is @xmath1 .",
    "thus we discuss the feasibility of detecting redshifted @xmath0  cm radiation using the gmrt , mwa , ska and owfa as these instruments can target this redshift range .",
    "the analysis is not meant to be exhaustive but a broad brush comparison of these instruments .    in this paper",
    "we use the model suggested by @xcite for populating dark matter halos with neutral hydrogen .",
    "we then proceed to compute the expected signal and compare this with the sensitivity of several radio telescopes .",
    "this comparison is done using the approach used in @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the foregrounds in this paper , readers may refer to @xcite for a discussion and references .",
    "the observables in the context of the hi intensity mapping are visibility correlations and these have been shown to be related to the redshift space power spectrum of hi fluctuations @xcite in the limit of a small field of view .",
    "a physically motivated scheme to populate dark matter halos with neutral hydrogen has been used in the past for modelling the hi power spectrum @xcite and similar results for clustering are obtained in the halo model with a similar approach @xcite .",
    "this model is able to reproduce the column density distribution of dlas @xcite , though it seems to under - predict the bias for dlas as compared to recent observational determination @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use a fitting function for the hi power spectrum in order to estimate the signal in redshifted @xmath0  cm radiation from the large scale distribution of hi at @xmath1 .",
    "this approach uses the linearly evolved matter power spectrum and a fitting function for a scale dependent bias and non - linear evolution , where the fitting function is obtained from n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows the power spectrum for the hi distribution as obtained from n - body simulations . for ease of computation , we do not use the conventional bias but work instead with the offset between the hi power spectrum and the linearly extrapolated power spectrum for dark matter : thus it gives the combined effect of non - linear growth of perturbations as well as a scale dependent bias .",
    "one immediate benefit of this approach is that we are not limited to the scales resolved in simulations used to derive the hi power spectrum .",
    "there is a need to excercise caution when extrapolating to smaller scales as we know little about the scale dependence of bias at these scales from n - body simulations .",
    "however , in this work we are analyzing signal primarily at large angular scales and hence the effect of errors in modelling scales smaller than those resolved in simulations can be shown to be minimal .",
    "the hi content of galaxies at very low redshifts can be estimated directly from observed emission of @xmath0  cm radiation .",
    "this radiation arises from the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen @xcite and if the spin temperature is much higher than the temperature of the cmbr ( cosmic microwave background radiation ) then the emission is proportional to the amount of neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the spin temperature in turn is determined by coupling with atoms , electrons and lyman-@xmath7 line radiation @xcite . at intermediate redshifts , techniques such as co - adding and cross - correlation @xcite have been used to detect neutral hydrogen . as we get to even higher redshifts , statistical detection is the only viable approach for observing the large scale distribution of hi .",
    "the collective emission from the undetected regions is present as a very faint background in all radio observations at frequencies below @xmath11  mhz .",
    "the fluctuations in this background radiation carry an imprint of the hi distribution at the redshift @xmath12 where the radiation originated .",
    "hi emission from the post - reionization era can be used as a probe of the large scale structure and can also be used to constrain cosmological paramters @xcite .",
    "it should be noted though that the possibility of direct detection of extreme objects @xcite should not be discounted , particularly in the light of very high bias at small scales @xcite .    realizing the potential for constraining cosmological parameters , the majority of the existing and upcoming radio - interferometric experiments such as lofar , mwa , ska , paper , etc .",
    "are aimed at measuring the hi 21 cm signal statistically and map out the large scale hi distribution at high redshifts with the primary focus on the epoch of reionization .",
    "similarly chime is an experiment for detecting post - reionization distribution of hi at large scales .",
    "the ooty wide field array ( owfa ) @xcite is the upgraded ooty radio telescope where the collecting area and the primary receivers remain the same but the entire backend has been changed .",
    "owfa has a much larger field of view and a much larger bandwidth as compared to the earlier configuration .",
    "a new programmable backend has been added to the existing capability . for details , please see @xcite .",
    "owfa has the potential of detecting hi at @xmath10 and also measuring the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "owfa consists of a parabolic cylindrical antenna which is @xmath13  m long in north - south direction and @xmath14  m wide in east - west direction .",
    "it is an equatorially mounted phased array of @xmath15 dipoles placed along the focal line of the reflector .",
    "the east - west steering ( ra ) is done by the mechanical rotation of the telescope about its n - s axis and steering of beam in north - south direction ( declination ) is achieved by introducing appropriate delays between the dipoles .",
    "the array possesses huge redundancy ( different antenna pairs correspond to same baseline ) due to its linearity and uniform spacing of the antenna elements @xcite .",
    "this redundancy is very useful for precision experiments , since it allows for model independent estimation of both the element gains as well as true visibilities @xcite .",
    "the array has been upgraded to improve sensitivity and the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "it can now be used as an interferometer and has multibeaming feature .",
    "owfa has @xmath16 antenna elements and each element can be approximated as a rectangular aperture dimensions(_b @xmath17 d _ ) equal to @xmath14  m @xmath17 @xmath18  m. the primary field of view is about @xmath19  in e - w direction and @xmath20  in n - s direction with a resolution of @xmath21 .",
