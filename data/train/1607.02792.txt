    "a common theme occurring in all these proofs is that they rely on the _ partite construction _ introduced in  @xcite . generally speaking ,",

    "_ partite amalgamations_.    in both  @xcite and  @xcite the partite lemma essentially says that the result to be proved holds whenever @xmath16 is @xmath0-partite and it is proved by an application of the hales - jewett theorem discussed in subsection  [ subsec : hj ] below .",
    "the partite amalgamations were straightforward in  @xcite but in the case of steiner systems  @xcite some arguments were needed to show that no pairs of distinct edges intersecting in @xmath52 or more vertices were created .",

    "when one attempts to base a proof of theorem  [ thm : main - a ] on the same ideas , there arises the following problem : while it is perfectly possible to use the hales - jewett theorem again for proving a partite lemma ( see the `` preliminary partite lemma '' in subsection  [ subsec : ppl ] below ) it turns out that its intersection properties are not strong enough for enabling us to perform partite amalgamations in sufficiently general situations . our way of coping with",
    "that difficulty is that we run the partite construction twice .",
    "the first time we just aim at getting a better partite lemma , called the `` clean partite lemma '' in subsection  [ subsec : pl ] below . owing to its more useful intersection properties this lemma",
    "can then be applied in a second partite construction that proves theorem  [ thm : main - a ] ( see subsection  [ subsec : apc ] below ) .    for experts on the partite method it might also be interesting to observe that while our proof of the clean partite lemma uses a special feature of the hales - jewett cube ( see clause  [ it : ppl2 ] of lemma  [ subsec : ppl ] below )",
