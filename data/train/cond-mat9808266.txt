    "in this paper , we reexamine a model of crystal surfaces in three dimensions @xcite , which is inspired by the terrace - ledge - kink ( tlk ) @xcite ideas of kossel and stransky @xcite . by careful specification",
    ", an isomorphism can be established between our system and an extension of the six - vertex models @xcite , which allows an exact discussion at a thermodynamic level of the different types of phase transitions which take place .",
    "we complement this with recent relevant deductions from conformal field theory , which give microscopic insight .",
    "we shall return to this six - vertex isomorphism after the next few paragraphs , in which we describe the model and outline the results .",
    "consider a vicinal section of a crystal surface , that is one which on average is tilted by a small angle from a closed packed plane .",
    "let this underlying plane have normal @xmath0 and let the normal to the mean vicinal surface lie in the plane containing @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "following kossel and stransky @xcite , we give the vicinal surface a microscopic structure by regarding it as the upper surface of a set of unit cubes , each of which representing a molecule or atom , which are stacked vertically with no voids , thereby covering the basal plane @xmath2 with columns of cubes .",
    "we shall make a somewhat eccentric choice of lattice structure , which is described in detail below , and which will turn out to be of crucial importance in the statistical - mechanical modelling of the short - ranged interactions between ledges .",
    "we now impose the vicinal condition by making the height on the left extremum of the surface equal to zero , and the height on the right one equal to some constant positive integer .",
    "these extrema intersect the lines @xmath3 and @xmath4 of @xmath5 as zig - zags or zippers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "connected components of the upper surface having the same height are termed terraces and are separated from other terraces by ledges , which can have bends through an angle of @xmath6 : these are termed kinks .    in this paper",
    ", we shall make two further restrictions : firstly , there are no adatoms or pits on the terraces ; and secondly , ledges can not separate adjacent terraces with a height difference greater than unity .",
    "this means that different ledges can never coincide and that no ledge can form a closed loop : each ledge begins at the bottom of the lattice and exits at the top .",
    "we emphasize that the above construction is not the only way of generating exactly solvable models .",
    "other routes are the bcsos @xcite and the surface deconstruction @xcite model .",
    "there is also the hamiltonian limit type of approximation proposed by jayaprakash et al .",
    "@xcite and by burkhardt and schlottmann @xcite , together with other work by villain et al .",
    "@xcite and by bartelt et al .",
    "there is a general review of morphology of vicinal surfaces in @xcite . for small tilt angles",
    "@xmath7 , a polynomial approximation is given to the surface free energy @xmath8 where f()=f(0)+a+b^3 [ approx ] in which @xmath9 is related to the kink energy and @xmath10 comes from ledge - ledge interactions which can be entropic in character , elastic ( although the distinction between these two is not entirely clear ) or coming from electrostatic dipolar interactions in metals .",
    "we scrutinize from our exact solution and also analyse the ledge - ledge interaction from first principles in appendix e.    our model shows the formation of a crystal facet at half - filling , which we can regard as at a tilt angle of @xmath11 . in the low - temperature phase , the surface height fluctuations about the @xmath11 tilted plane are of order one , but above the faceting temperature there is power - law decay of ledge - ledge correlation functions , making kosterlitz - thouless @xcite behaviour extremely likely .",
    "as we shall see , for a certain _ nonzero _ repulsion between ledges we get a free - fermionic structure of the transfer matrix , and in this case the height fluctuations are shown to be of kosterlitz - thouless type .    finally , we note that our model is closely related to a lattice regularization of the anisotropic principal chiral field @xcite .",
    "we consider a square lattice tilted by 45 degrees ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) ) , and define a configuration by declaring each link between two lattice sites to be occupied ( state up , denoted 1 ) or empty ( state down , denoted 2 ) .",
    "we then impose the six - vertex constraint or ice rule : at each vertex ( centered at lattice sites ) the number of occupied links must be conserved between top and bottom .",
    "an example of an allowed configuration is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](a ) , where the occupied links are drawn as thick lines .",
    "= 0.4 = 0.4    every such allowed configuration can now be mapped onto a configuration of terraces , ledges and kinks defining a surface .",
    "we first introduce _ ledges _ by drawing short vertical lines through the middle of each occupied link ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) ) .",
    "these segments are then connected by horizontal lines representing _ kinks _ , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2c](a ) .",
    "treating ledges and kinks as steps on a surface , the above procedure then defines _ terraces _ , which are indicated by different shades of grey in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2c](b )",
    ". figure  [ fig : fig1 ] explicits the three - dimensional structure .",
    "= 0.4 = 0.4    the above procedure leads to a number of restrictions on the allowed configurations of terraces , ledges and kinks .",
    "for example ledges can not form closed loops , and there can not be multiple kinks .",
    "= 0.4 = 0.4    this last restriction can be effectively removed by a slight modification of the ledge representation . stretching the lattice by @xmath12 in the horizontal direction",
    "we can introduce a lattice of regular hexagons , and use the sides of these hexagons to define the ledges and kinks as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fighex2c ] . in this case",
    "the restrictions on multiple kinks are built into the lattice structure .",
    "= 0.45 = 0.45    we therefore end up with two slightly different geometrical representations for the configurations : in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( a ) the underlying lattice is square , although there are restrictions in the allowed configurations which involve the tiling of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2c ] ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) the terrace - ledge - kink structure is placed on a hexagonal lattice .",
    "we now associate a weight with each configuration .",
    "= 0.9    in terms of the underlying six - vertex model we associate a boltzmann weight according to the rule shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figver ] with each vertex .",
    "the weight @xmath13 is a kink fugacity , and lower values of @xmath13 correspond to stiffer ledges .",
    "the weights also depend on the interaction energy @xmath10 between neighbouring ledges and the ledge stiffness ( note that in our model only neighbouring ledges interact and that by construction ledges can never cross each other ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is a ledge fugacity or chemical potential , which controls the number of ledges , or equivalently the slope of the crystal surface .",
    "= 0.9    we now discuss the relationships between the three weight assignments shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : figweights ] .",
    "some aspects of the bethe ansatz for ( ii ) have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz generates eigenvectors for the @xmath14 transfer matrix with fixed fraction of up arrows , corresponding to a given vicinal section angle .",
    "the solution gives the limiting free energy per unit area , in principle for all angles , but in closed form by fourier methods only for the half - filled case .",
    "it was argued that there are two quite distinct types of phase transition , which occur at the solutions of @xmath15 .    for @xmath16 ( attraction between ledges ) , there is a reconstructive phase transition at a temperature @xmath17 to a state with zero limiting entropy for @xmath18 .",
    "as the temperature approaches @xmath17 from above , the specific heat diverges as @xmath19 ( cf .",
    "end of appendix e ; this is similar to @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the transition at @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , implying repulsion between the ledges .",
    "this problem was discussed in the fixed vertical polarization case with the @xmath14 transfer matrix in @xcite .",
    "there it was found that at half - filling the system displays an infinite - order phase transition similar to the kosterlitz - thouless one @xcite , or the van beijeren one in the bcsos case @xcite .",
    "we consider the weight assignment ( i ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : figweights ] and we use a legendre transform with respect to the variable @xmath9 , with no fixing of the polarization , in order to go to the physical situation of case ( ii ) with fixed polarization .",
    "notice that neither ( i ) nor ( ii ) is equivalent to the usual @xmath22 field scenario in the six - vertex model ( iii ) : new results are needed .",
    "we note that the model ( i ) is not the same as ( ii ) because the chemical potential @xmath9 is not always an invertible function of the ledge number .",
    "in other words , the model @xcite contains phases that are not accessible by tuning @xmath9 in the model considered here .",
    "the situation is analogous to the six - vertex model in a vertical field or equivalently the heisenberg xxz chain in a magnetic field @xmath23 . if we consider the ferromagnet in the sector with fixed magnetization the ground state is rather complicated @xcite .",
    "this phase is not accessible by tuning the magnetic field and considering the absolute ground state ( i.e. the minimal energy state in the grand canonical ensemble where the number of up / down spins is variable ) as the ground state will always be the saturated ferromagnetic state with all spins up or down .",
    "we use the quantum inverse scattering method , which is reviewed in @xcite , to derive new results , as well as the old ones in a formulation which may be more familiar for most readers .",
    "we calculate : e(a , b)= _ z_(a ; b , w ) where z_(a ; b , w)=trace_j=1^|| e^bn_1e^a(n_1-n_2)w^n_3+n_4 where the trace is taken over all ice - rule - compliant configurations on @xmath24 points for a @xmath25 lattice ; @xmath26 is the number of vertices of type @xmath27 in the lattice configuration .",
    "the free energy for fixed polarization is then given by f(m ; b , w)=_a(e(a , b)-ma ) .",
    "[ legendre ] correlation functions may be calculated in either ensemble by appropriately relating @xmath28 and the optimal @xmath29 in , which is unique provided that @xmath30 exists at @xmath29 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section iii , we give the bethe ansatz equations and expressions for the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix . a detailed derivation of these results , as well as the classification of the model in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method , appears in appendix a. in section iv we discuss the phase diagram and calculate explicitly the free energy . in section",
    "v we give a precise definition of height and height - difference correlation functions .",
    "sections vi and vii are concerned with the determination of the large - distance behaviour of these correlation functions .",
    "finally we summarize our results and discuss their relevance in relation to other theoretical and experimental work .",
    "there are several further appendices discussing some technical aspects of our work : the free - fermion case is solved explicitly in appendix b , and appendix c deals with the analysis of the bethe ansatz equation in the case of negative kink energy , where novel peculiarities concerning the distribution of roots in the complex plane are encountered .",
    "appendix d gives the second - quantized form of the transfer operator , and in appendix e we discuss effective interactions between ledges and some low - angle expansions .",
    "denoting the weight matrix by @xmath31 we have in case ( i ) : @xmath32    the vertex model defined by ( [ weights ] ) is exactly solvable by bethe ansatz . in @xcite a particular parametrization of the bethe ansatz equations ( for the case @xmath33 )",
    "was derived using coordinate space techniques . in appendix",
    "a we show that the model ( [ weights ] ) can actually be embedded into a family of commuting transfer matrices and derive a parametrization of the bethe ansatz equations in terms of entire functions . in the language of the quantum inverse scattering method @xcite the model ( [ weights ] )",
    "is simply a particular case of an inhomogeneous asymmetric 6-vertex model @xcite .",
    "as is shown in appendix a , it is convenient to introduce parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that @xmath37 eigenstates of the transfer matrix ( with @xmath38 ledges ) are parametrized in terms of rapidity variables @xmath39 , which are subject to the following set of coupled algebraic equations , called bethe ansatz equations @xmath40 the eigenvalues of the operator of translation by two sites are given by @xmath41 and the eigenvalues @xmath42 of the diagonal - to - diagonal transfer matrix @xmath43 are @xmath44",
    "the parametrization ( [ para ] ) is such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 can not always chosen to be real .",
    "furthermore , due to the fact that @xmath9 and @xmath10 must be real and @xmath13 must be real and between @xmath45 and @xmath46 there are restrictions on the regions of `` physical '' @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "as @xmath9 and @xmath10 are real so is @xmath36 , and by exchanging up and down spins in the bethe ansatz solution ( see appendix a ) we can restrict ourselves to the case @xmath47 .",
    "the permitted values of @xmath10 and @xmath13 are covered by the following three regimes of @xmath34 and @xmath35 :    *   @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; *   @xmath48 and @xmath49 are real with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; *   @xmath48 and @xmath49 are purely imaginary .",
    "it is convenient to choose a parametrization obtained from ( [ para ] ) and ( [ baeq ] ) by taking @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which leads to the following set of equations + @xmath57 + where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath61 *   @xmath49 and @xmath62 are purely imaginary .",
    "a convenient parametrization is then @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "we substitute @xmath65 .",
    "the bethe ansatz equations become @xmath66 the eigenvalues of @xmath67 are @xmath68    by analysing the bethe ansatz equations in the various regions we can determine the largest eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and thus establish the phase diagram of the model .      as in the case of the symmetric six - vertex model the phase structure of the tlk model for vanishing vertical field @xmath69",
    "is closely related to the parametrization of the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "we find that there are three different phases corresponding to the three different regimes in @xmath34 and @xmath35 discussed above .",
    "phase  1 is a critical ( rough ) phase whereas phase  2 and phase  3 correspond to massive phases ( smooth surfaces ) .",
    "they are the analogs of the ferro ( 2 ) and antiferroelectric ( 3 ) phases in the symmetric six - vertex model .",
    "the resulting phase diagram for @xmath69 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "= 0.4    the precise parametrization of the phase boundaries for @xmath69 is as follows : the boundary between region  ( 1 ) and region  ( 2 ) corresponds to @xmath34 and @xmath35 small with @xmath70 finite , and @xmath71 the boundary between region  ( 1 ) and region  ( 3 ) is for @xmath72 and @xmath35 small with @xmath73 finite @xmath74      we now discuss the phase diagram as a function of @xmath36 for various points in the @xmath75 plane .",
    "the situation is analogous to the one for the xxz heisenberg chain in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "as far as the parametrization of the bethe ansatz equations is concerned , the @xmath75 plane is divided into regions  ( 1)-(3 ) as discussed above . at @xmath69 the phase structure of the model exactly",
    "reflects this division of the @xmath75 plane .",
    "* let us consider a fixed point @xmath76 in region  ( 1 ) . at @xmath69",
    "the model is thus critical .",
    "as @xmath36 is decreased the phase boundary between phase  1 and phase  2 moves in negative @xmath10 direction and eventually encompasses @xmath77 : the model is then massive and we are in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "@xmath77 remains in phase  2 as @xmath36 is decreased further .",
    "* next we consider a point @xmath78 in region  ( 2 ) . for any value of @xmath79",
    "the model is in phase  2 .",

    "as @xmath36 is decreased further , @xmath81 finally enters into phase  2 .",
    "the above picture , together with the precise parametrization of the phase boundaries for @xmath47 , follows from the analysis of the largest eigenvalues of @xmath43 , which is outlined in the next subsection .",
    "the change of the phase boundaries under a decrease of @xmath36 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "the corresponding ledge chemical potential tends to decrease the number of ledges in the system and as a result the transition to the state with no ledges ( phase  2 ) occurs at a smaller value of ledge attraction @xmath10 for fixed @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    "the critical regime extends to stronger ledge repulsion .",
    "= 0.4      let us now turn to the distribution of rapidities @xmath82 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath43 in the three phases .",

    "thus for sufficiently large negative @xmath36 we are in the ferroelectric phase  2 .",
    "we exclude this case from the following discussion .",

    "note however that , contrary to the statement implied there , @xmath385 and @xmath386 do not commute , because the `` hopping '' terms do not allow it .",
    "but , if we take @xmath10 and @xmath387 so small that only linear terms can be retained , where @xmath387 is defined by @xmath388 , then the transfer matrix t=_1^n t_2j_1^n t_2j-1 can be approximated by @xmath389 with h = b_1 ^ 2nn_j n_j+1 + ^*_1 ^ 2n ( _ j^+_j+1 ^ -+_j^-_j+1^+ ) .",
    "[ ham ] this is the xxz model in a field . we emphasize that is an uncontrolled approximation which is not needed in our solution .",
    "the interaction between two ledges may be investigated by considering the incremental free energy per unit cylinder length with @xmath390 ledges ( the @xmath390-particle sector , that is ) on a cylinder having finite circumference @xmath107 , length @xmath225 and joined along the cylinder axis to form a torus .",
    "we define the incremental free energy by f^(2p , n)=_l where @xmath391 is the partition function on the torus for @xmath390 particles .",
    "this is evaluated by giving the momenta their lowest values @xmath392 consistent with .",
    "asymptotically for large n , in that part of the parameter space with no ledge binding , this equation becomes e^ik_jn=-1 for @xmath393 with minimal solutions k_j=(2j-2p-1)/n . from , we have f^(2p , n)2pw + ( ) _ p_0=0 _ 1^p k_j^2 . [ f2pn ]",
    "we assume that the second term above is made up of @xmath390 equal ledge - ledge pair interactions and that the ledges are on average equally spaced at a distance @xmath394",
    ". then this asymptotic pair interaction @xmath395 is given by : u(p , l)&= & ( ) _ p_0=0 _ 1^p(2j-1)^2 & = & .",
    "[ upl ] notice firstly that @xmath395 is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "it depends on the sector @xmath396 ; this is an example of the effect mentioned by fisher @xcite in the wetting context .",
    "much interest attaches to the case with a small density @xmath108 of ledges , which is the same as that given by in the @xmath397 limit . in this regime",
    "the following approximation can be used : d=2x_f(0)+^(2)(0)+o(x_f^5 ) [ appe : d ] where ( 0)=(1-k(0))^(-1)_0(0 ) + o(x_f^3 ) and ^(2)(0)=_0^(2)(0 ) + ( ) ^2k^(2)(0)_0(0)+o(x_f^4 ) it is natural to define @xmath398 by y_f = x_f(1-k(0))^-1 [ appe : dressed ] so that @xmath399 , a dressing of the fermi level . thus d=2_0(0)y_f+y_f^3+o(y_f^4 ) which is readily inverted , giving y_f(d)=d- d^3+o(d^4 ) the free energy is obtained from by approximating the small integral for small @xmath400 and then inserting , leading to e&=&2a + 2y_f_0(0)_0(0 ) + ( _ 0^(2)_0(0)+_0_0^(2)(0 ) ) + o(y_f^4 ) + & = & 2a+_0(0)d + + o(d^4 ) now = 2 ^ 2 w giving e=2a+_0(0)d++o(d^4 ) .",
    "a similar expansion can be used near the transition between the massless and ferromagnetic phases .",
    "this transition can be driven either by the chemical potential or by temperature . in both cases",
    "the analytic behaviour near the transition can be studied using the parameter @xmath401 , which is equal to @xmath402 if the relevant parameter is the chemical potential @xmath9 , and @xmath403 if using the temperature . the fermi level is obtained by expanding the left - hand side of @xmath404 : to leading order @xmath405 and @xmath406 , therefore @xmath407 .",
    "it follows that the free energy has a @xmath408 singularity , and thus that the specific heat diverges like @xmath409 .",
