    "an interesting new idea started emerging a decade ago ( see , e.g. , treu et al .",

    "; but also see futamase & yoshida 2001 ) to use individual lensing galaxies in order to measure cosmological parameters . in principle , the deflection of quasar light by the intervening galaxy is known precisely from general relativity as long as one has a good model for the mass distribution within the lens ( bartelmann & schneider 1999 ; refregier 2003 ) .",
    "the einstein radius , inferred from the deflection angle , then provides a measure of the angular - size distance , which may be used to discriminate between competing cosmological models .",
    "the key , of course , is how well we understand the distribution of matter within the lens , and this appears to be the principal source of error in this type of measurement . as of today",
    ", the observation of some 70 or so lensing galaxy systems has provided the data that , in principle , can be used to carry out this kind of study .",
    "the results thus far are consistent with the standard ( @xmath0cdm ) model , though the precision with which model parameters may be determined with this appoach is not yet as good as that available in other studies , e.g. , using type ia sne as standard candles ( see , e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .    in recent years ,",
    "the application of model selection tools in one - on - one comparisons between @xmath0cdm and a cosmology we refer to as the @xmath1 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) has shown that the data actually tend to favor the latter over the former .",
    "these include the use of cosmic chronometers ( melia & maier 2013 ) , high-@xmath5 quasars ( melia 2013 ) , gamma ray bursts ( wei et al . 2013 ) and , most recently , the type ia sne themselves ( wei et al .",
    "the simplest way to view this cosmology is to start with @xmath0cdm and then apply the additional constraint @xmath6 on its total equation of state , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the total pressure and energy density , respectively . with these other kinds of data , @xmath1",
    "is favored over @xmath0cdm with a likelihood of @xmath9 versus only @xmath10 .",
    "the principal goal of this paper is to broaden the comparison between @xmath1 and @xmath0cdm by now including strong gravitational lenses in this study . in   2 of this paper ,",
    "we describe the method , and then assemble the catalog of suitable lensing systems in   3 .",
    "we discuss our results in   4 .",
    "we will find that the current strong lensing sample is not yet large enough to differentiate between these two competing models , and we show in   5 how large the source catalog needs to be in order to rule out one or the other expansion scenarios at a 3-sigma confidence level .",
    "we present our conclusions in   6 .",
    "the lens model often fitted to the observed images is based on a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ; ratnatunga et al .",
    "1999 ) , in which the projected mass distribution ( at redshift @xmath11 ) is elliptical , with semi - minor axis @xmath12 and semi - major axis @xmath13 . in this paper",
    ", we will adopt the simpler version , using a singular isothermal sphere instead . for generality",
    ", we will describe the approach using semi - major and semi - minor axes , though we will later set the two angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 equal to each other .",
    "the source lensed by this system is a quasar at redshift @xmath14 .",
    "the key expression in strong gravitational lensing theory is the lens equation ( schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) , which gives the mapping between positions @xmath15 in the source plane and @xmath16 in the image plane , according to @xmath17 the lensing potential of the singular isothermal ellipsoid may be written ( kormann et al .",
    "1994 ) @xmath18 where the einstein radius @xmath19 is defined below in terms of the ( one - dimensional ) velocity dispersion , @xmath20 , in the lensing galaxy , and the angular diameter distances , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , between lens and source and between source and observer , respectively .",
    "the ` ellipticity ' @xmath23 is related to the eccentricity @xmath24 of the critical line by @xmath25 in addition , the semi - major and semi - minor axes are related to the einstein radius @xmath26 where @xmath27 via the relations @xmath28 as noted , earlier , we will here consider the simpler case of a single isothermal sphere ( sis ) , for which @xmath29 .    in principle , equation  ( 4 ) can be used to test cosmological models in a rather unique way because , unlike other kinds of comparisons that rely on the optimization of the hubble constant @xmath30 , this particular analysis is completely independent of @xmath30 . directly using strong gravitational lensing , but only when time delays are measured between the various images of a given source ( see , e.g. , paraficz & hjorth 2009 ; suyu et al . 2013 ; wei et al .",
    "] nonetheless , even though knowledge of @xmath30 is not necessary for this type of test , fits to the data do depend on the reliability of lens modelling ( e.g. , via the assumption of a singular isothermal sphere , or a singular isothermal ellipsoid ) and the measurement of the velocity dispersion .",
    "when using these expressions , @xmath20 ( the total velocity dispersion of stellar plus dark matter ) can not be obtained directly from the surface - brightness weighted average of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion that is actually measured . in practice",
    ", the central velocity dispersion @xmath31 is estimated from the _ stellar _ velocity dispersion within @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the optical effective radius ( see , e.g. , treu et al .",
    "2006 ; grillo et al .",
    "2008 ) , and is then used to represent the velocity dispersion @xmath34 for the corresponding singular isothermal sphere or ellpisoid ( for the total mass present ) .",
    "this works rather well because inside one effective radius , massive elliptical galaxies are kinematically indistinguishable from an isothermal ellipsoid ( koopmans et al .",
    "2009 ) , which is quite remarkable considering the fact that @xmath34 and @xmath31 need not be the same .",
    "one reason is that dark matter halos appear to be dynamically hotter than the luminous stars ( based on x - ray observations ) , so the former must necessarily have a greater velocity dispersion than the latter ( white & davis 1996 ) .",
    "still , when one introduces the sis equivalent value @xmath34 obtained from modelling the lens as a singular isothermal sphere , these two measures of velocity dispersion agree very closely .",
    "treu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used the large and homogeneously selected sample of lenses identified by the sloan lenses acs survey ( slacs ; bolton et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) to study in detail the degree of homogeneity of the early - type galaxies by measuring the ratio between stellar velocity dispersion and @xmath34 that best fits the geometry of the corresponding multiple images .",
    "they found that the ratio @xmath35 is very close to unity ; specifically , they inferred a sample average value @xmath36 , with a relatively small scatter of @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , van de ven et al .",
    "( 2003 ) examined this ratio for a range of anisotropy parameters and found that @xmath38 .",
    "the conclusion from such studies is that on average the approximation @xmath39 works surprisingly well , due perhaps to some as yet unknown mechanism that couples stellar and dark mass , sometimes referred to as a bulge - halo ` conspiracy ' .",
    "a possible resolution of this parity may be that since the nfw ( navarro et al . 1997 ) and observed stellar mass profiles are nearly isothermal , the more concentrated mass profiles for the baryon component than for dark matter may simply be a consequence of dissipative star formation",
    ". the observation of @xmath40 may therefore not be so mysterious .",
    "nonetheless , significant departures from this are seen in individual cases , so one can not ignore the scatter in any discussion concerning the propagated measurement error for @xmath41 .    in this paper",
    ", we will follow cao et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , and put @xmath42 with @xmath43 we will keep @xmath44 as a free parameter to be optimized in the fits , since it mimics at least several effects that apparently give rise to the observed scatter in the individually measured ratio @xmath45 for each system .",
    "these include : ( 1 ) systematic errors in the rms deviation of @xmath34 from @xmath31 ; ( 2 ) an rms error associated with the assumption that the sis model allows the translation from observed image separation to @xmath19 ; and ( 3 ) a softened isothermal sphere potential , which tends to decrease the typical image separations ( narayan & bartelmann 1996 ) . in the analysis we describe below , we will adopt a dispersion @xmath46 , based on the rms scatter of @xmath47 found from the work of treu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and van de ven et al .",
    "note , however , that @xmath48 may be as big as @xmath49 according to cao et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , though one might have expected such a large value to have emerged directly from the aforementioned survey by treu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "the overall uncertainty associated with @xmath50 ( calculated from equation  7 ) is estimated through the propagation equation involving errors in @xmath19 , @xmath31 , and @xmath44 . according to grillo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the error in measuring the einstein radius @xmath19 is @xmath51 , so we will assume a dispersion @xmath52 for this quantity . in principle ,",
    "any optimization of the model parameters ( and @xmath44 ) carried out while fitting the data should also include the dispersion @xmath53 in the measured redshifts @xmath11 and @xmath54 ( since the theoretical values @xmath21 and @xmath22 directly depend on these ) .",
    "however , a careful analysis of sdss quasar spectra shows that @xmath55 over a broad range of redshifts ( hewett & wild 2010 ) .",
    "this error is so small compared to the other three uncertainties that we will ignore it .",
    "so in total , we will calculate the dispersion @xmath56 in @xmath50 using the expression @xmath57^{1/2}\\;.\\ ] ] note that since the uncertainty in @xmath31 also appears to be @xmath51 ( grillo et al .",
    "2008 ) , the average dispersion in the measured value of @xmath58 is expected to be @xmath59 .",
    "now , in principle , only the range @xmath60 is physically meaningful , but such a value of @xmath56 can result in at least some measurements @xmath61 .",
    "a quick inspection of equation  ( 5 ) shows that the measurements most at risk for this type of outcome involve lenses much closer to the observer than the source . as we shall see below , several of the sources in our complete sample have @xmath61 .",
    "though unrealistic , such values are consistent with the quoted error , so we will include them in our analysis . but to demonstrate their negative impact on the optimization of the model fits , we will also carry out the analysis for a reduced sample omitting these sources .",
    "as the measurements become more precise , and the sample of strong lensing sources grows , it may be possible to avoid systems with @xmath61 altogether .    from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", one must assume a cosmological model in order to calculate the angular diameter distances @xmath21 and @xmath22 , once the redshifts @xmath11 and @xmath54 for a particular lensing system are known .",
    "in @xmath0cdm , this distance depends on several parameters , including @xmath30 and the mass fractions @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , defined in terms of the current matter ( @xmath65 ) , radiation ( @xmath66 ) , and dark energy ( @xmath67 ) densities , and the critical density @xmath68 .",
    "assuming zero spatial curvature , so that @xmath69 , the angular diameter distance between redshifts @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) is given by the expression @xmath73^{-1/2}\\;dz\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the dark - energy equation of state .",
    "as noted earlier , @xmath30 cancels out when we divide @xmath75 by @xmath76 to form the ratio @xmath77 , so the essential remaining parameters in flat @xmath0cdm are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if we further assume that dark energy is a cosmological constant with @xmath80 , then only the parameter @xmath78 is available to fit the data .    in the @xmath1 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) , the angular diameter distance depends only on @xmath30 , but since here too the hubble constant cancels out in the ratio @xmath81 , there are actually no free parameters left for fitting the gravitational lensing data . in this cosmology ,",
    "our sample is drawn from a compilation of 69 strong lensing systems ( listed in table i ) , with good spectroscopic measurements of the central velocity dispersion , using the slacs ( _ sloan lens acs _ ) survey ( first introduced by bolton et al .",
    "2006 ; treu et al .",
    "2006 ; and koopmans et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the lsd ( _ lenses structure and dynamics _ ) survey ( see , e.g. , bolton et al . 2008 ; newton et al .",
    "some original contributions to these data sets may be found in young et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , huchra et al . ( 1985 ) , lehr et al . ( 1993 ) , fassnacht et al . (",
    "1996 ) , tonry et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , koopmans & treu ( 2002 , 2003 ) , and treu and koopmans ( 2004 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath31 and its uncertainty ( with the aforementioned average value of @xmath51 ) were obtained from the _ sloan digital sky survey database_. the slacs and lens surveys complement each other rather well , with the former comprised primarily of lens galaxies at redshift up to @xmath83 , while the latter includes systems beyond @xmath84 .    it has already been noted before ( see , e.g. , biesiada et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; cao et al . 2012 ) that some of these lenses produce 2 images , while others produce 4 .",
    "both 2-image and 4-image lens systems are usually affected by external shear .",
    "this effect degenerates with the ellipticity of the sie component , which introduces some uncertainty in estimating the einstein radius of a given lens . for 2-image systems this can be more problematic due to a lack of observational constraints . on the other hand ,",
    "4-image systems are better constrained observationally , so both their ellipticity and external shear may be determined for a more accurate measurement of the einstein radius . to gauge whether there are any systematic effects associated with one category or the other",
    ", we will here track the results using both sets of lens system .",
    "there is an additional drawback to the measurement of @xmath58 with strong gravitational lenses that we must carefully consider here . by its very definition , @xmath58",
    "is confined to a very compact range of values @xmath85 , regardless of the lens ( @xmath11 ) and quasar ( @xmath54 ) redshifts .",
    "in addition , there is no monotonic progression from low to high values of @xmath58 as the sequence of gravitational lenses approaches or recedes from us , since the sources may lie anywhere beyond them .",
    "fortunately , @xmath58 does not depend on @xmath30 , so a comparison between theoretical values of this ratio and @xmath86 is not inhibited by any uncertainty in the expansion rate itself .",
    "however , the tight range in @xmath58 and its lack of correlation with @xmath5 make it difficult to optimize parameters such as @xmath78 , which produce only slight changes in @xmath77 even when they increase by a factor of 2 or more . in this paper",

    "it is quite evident from these figures that the scatter in @xmath86 about the theoretical curves ( the straight dashed lines in these plots ) increases significantly as @xmath113 . in other words",
    ", it appears that measuring @xmath58 becomes progressively less precise as the distance to the gravitational lens becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of the distance to the quasar source .",
    "this may simply have to do with the fact that @xmath19 changes less and less for large values of @xmath114 so , for the same error in the einstein angle , one gets less precision in the measurement of @xmath115 .",
    "the principal results of this paper are summarized in tables  2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "the first two show how well the 4 models considered here fit the complete sample of 69 lens systems in table 1 ( for all values of @xmath86 ) , whereas the latter two give the corresponding results for the reduced sample with @xmath105 .",
    "based on the general trends emerging from these numbers , it is safe to draw the following conclusions : ( 1 ) even though the power of @xmath58 to discriminate between different values of @xmath78 in @xmath0cdm is quite limited , this analysis indicates that values larger than @xmath88 probably do nt work as well as those below it , though the differences in @xmath112 are still too small to draw any firm conclusions . and ( 2 ) , the @xmath1 fits the strong gravitational lens data at least as well as @xmath0cdm .",
    "still , the differences between @xmath1 and @xmath0cdm are small enough that one can not choose one model over the other based solely on this analysis , using the current sample of strong gravitational lens systems .",
