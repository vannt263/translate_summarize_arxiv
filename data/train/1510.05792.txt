    "quadratic eigenvalue problems appear in various engineering disciplines .",
    "often they are the result of finite element modeling rather than established partial differential equations .",
    "a classical example is a damped vibrating structure . for a spatially discretized structure",
    "we have , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the finite element stiffness matrix , @xmath2 is the damping matrix , @xmath3 is the mass matrix , @xmath4 is the eigenvalue , and @xmath5 is the corresponding eigenvector . assuming all matrices to be real there are @xmath6 finite eigenvalues ( @xmath7 being the dimension of the matrices ) that are real or complex conjugate .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath5 is a right eigenvector of @xmath4 then @xmath8 is a right eigenvector of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath2 is also symmetric the left and right eigenvectors are equal .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed discussion on how the spectrum and eigenspaces depend on properties of the matrices , and for an extensive overview of applications see @xcite .",
    "we will use a specific finite element realization of the more general formulation presented in equation   as a starting point for this work .",
    "we seek an eigenvalue @xmath9 and eigenfunction @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a finite element space , such that , @xmath12 where the three bilinear forms in the left hand side corresponds to the three matrices @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 in equation  .",
    "in particular we are interested in problems where the coefficient @xmath13 varies rapidly in space modeling , e.g. , rapid material data variation .",
    "it is well known that in order to capture the correct behavior of the solution , the finite element space @xmath11 has to be large enough to resolve the data variations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will not question the properness of this model .",
    "we assume that the parameter @xmath14 was carefully chosen in an earlier modeling or discretization step .",
    "there are various models for the damping .",
    "the simplest one is proportional damping where @xmath15 with @xmath16 using the matrix notation . in this case",
    "the eigenmodes actually coincide with the eigenmodes of the linear generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath17 but with different eigenvalues .",
    "if a structure is made up of different components ( or materials ) each of the parts may be modeled using proportional damping with different constants .",
    "the full structure will then have spatially varying damping parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the damping will therefore not be proportional . in this work",
    "we will treat a general abstract damping bilinear form @xmath20 but in the numerical experiments we will focus on mass and stiffness type damping with spatially varying parameters .    numerical algorithms for solving quadratic eigenvalue problems",
    "are often based on linearization @xcite .",
    "this technique results in a linear , possibly non - symmetric , generalized eigenvalue problem . in this approach , the size of the system gets doubled which , in the presence of multiscale features ( since the initial finite element space has to be very large ) is a drawback .",
    "another drawback might be that the underlying structure of the quadratic eigenvalue problem can be lost .",
    "there are also numerical schemes that can be applied directly to the quadratic eigenvalue problem without linearization , e.g. , @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will work with the linearized system .    while the literature in this context of numerical linear algebra is rich ,",
    "results on error analysis and convergence of finite element approximations to quadratic eigenvalue problems are rather limited @xcite . to our best knowledge ,",
    "the literature on gfems or multiscale methods for eigenvalue problems is limited to @xcite which treats the linear case . since linearization is a natural approach",
    "also when analyzing finite element approximations to quadratic eigenvalue problems , the literature on non - symmetric generalized eigenvalue problems is very relevant .",
    "standard references include @xcite and for non - compact operators @xcite .",
    "these works gives a mathematical foundation for the convergence analysis presented in this paper .",
    "this paper neither aims to improve existing linear algebra techniques for solving quadratic eigenvalue problems nor to invent new ones .",
    "the aim is to reduce the size of the system before applying any of the standard solvers and , thereby , to speed - up the overall computation significantly .",
    "this will be achieved by constructing a computable low dimensional subspace of @xmath11 , based on the framework of localized orthogonal decomposition ( lod ) @xcite .",
    "the space captures the main features of the eigenspaces and , in particular , the effect of the rapid oscillations induced by the rough diffusion coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "given this low dimensional space we can solve the quadratic eigenvalue problem at a greatly reduced computational cost while the accuracy is largely preserved . under weak assumptions on the damping",
    ", the error analysis shows that the gfem approximation is very accurate ( in the sense of super convergence ) when compared to the reference finite element solution , independent of the variations in the multiscale data .",
    "the proofs are based on the classical theory for non - symmetric eigenvalue problems presented in @xcite .",
    "numerical examples confirm our theoretical findings .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ s : fem ]",
    "we present the model problem and its linearization .",
    "section  [ s : lod ] is devoted to the proposed numerical method . in section  [",
    "s : error ] , we will derive a convergence result for the approximation .",
    "section  [ s : num ] shows numerical experiments and section  [ s : conclusion ] presents some final conclusions .",
    "in this section we introduce finite element spaces , formulate the discrete model problem , linearize , and finally arrive at a detailed problem formulation .",
    "let @xmath21 denote regular finite element meshes of a computational domain @xmath22 , @xmath23 , into closed simplices with mesh - size functions @xmath24 .",
    "if no confusion seems likely , we use @xmath14 and @xmath25 also to denote the maximal mesh sizes .",
    "the first - order fine and coarse conforming finite element spaces are @xmath26 we assume that @xmath27 .",
    "by @xmath28 and @xmath29 we denote the set of interior vertices of the meshes . for every vertex @xmath5 ,",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the corresponding nodal basis function to @xmath32 and @xmath11 respectively .    while the nestedness of spaces @xmath27 is rather essential for our theory , the nestedness of the underlying meshes is not .",
    "the coarse finite element space @xmath33 could be any subspace of @xmath11 that admits a local basis @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , and possibly further conditions such as a partition of unity property ; see @xcite .",
    "the method is then also applicable in cases where the resolution of characteristic microscopic geometric features of the model requires a highly unstructured fine mesh",
    ". a prototypical construction for this scenario can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.2 and 7.3 ) .",
    "we will use a clment - type interpolation operator to restrict the reference mesh functions to the coarser mesh @xmath38 .",
    "the interpolant is defined in the following way .",

    "the damping can be kept in the left hand side and the relation given by variations over @xmath67 can be done using other bilinear forms or expressed in matrix wording , by any invertible matrix .",
    "our choice is common in the literature and fits our error analysis . for further discussion",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
