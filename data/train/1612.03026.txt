    "a non - equilibrated state of matter triggered by an ultrashort light pulse is acquiring great interest from both fundamental and application points of view  @xcite .",
    "the impact by the pulse can induce a variety of phenomena including coherent oscillations , ultrafast phase transitions , and femtosecond laser ablations that are applicable to micromachining  @xcite , thin film growth  @xcite , and clinical surgery  @xcite . the pulse may drive a solid state into warm - dense matter  @xcite , the extreme temperature and pressure of which mimic the conditions in the core of planets and stars  @xcite .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium phenomena can be studied by femtosecond pump - and - probe methods  @xcite , in which a probe pulse snapshots the sample impacted by a pump pulse .",
    "time - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( trpes ) has become a powerful tool to investigate the non - equilibrium properties of solid state matter from an electronic perspective  @xcite . in trpes ,",
    "a probing pulse has the photon energy that exceeds the work function , so that it can generate photoelectrons through a one - photon process : the distribution of the photoelectrons in energy and angle carries the information of the electronic structures .",
    "nowadays , the investigations are mostly done at the pump fluence @xmath1 of @xmath310  @xmath4j / cm@xmath2 based on ti : sapphire pulsed lasers  @xcite operating at 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7  khz repetition .",
    "these include : ultrafast perturbation / melt of charge - density waves accompanying coherent oscillations  @xcite ; ultrafast modification  @xcite and phase transition  @xcite of correlated insulators ; investigations into graphene  @xcite , graphitic materials  @xcite , semiconductors  @xcite , and cuprate superconductors  @xcite ; disclosure of novel states  @xcite , dynamics  @xcite , and functions  @xcite in topological insulators ; and others  @xcite .",
    "one of the natural pathways to understand the far - from - equilibrium phenomena is to approach them from the near - equilibrium , or mildly non - equilibrated states induced by a weak pump pulse . besides",
    ", dynamics induced by a low pump fluence can be interesting on its own  @xcite . in order to discern the small variations induced by the low - fluence pump in trpes ,",
    "it becomes practical to achieve higher repetition rate , or increase the number of pump - probe events per unit time , and improve the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the dataset .",
    "note , there is a limit in improving s / n by increasing the probe intensity .",
    "when too intense , the probe pulse generates a bunch of photoelectrons that repel each other through space - charge effects , thereby resulting in an undesired broadening in their distribution .",
    "fiber lasers have emerged as a powerful high - repetition femtosecond light source  @xcite .",
    "optical fibers doped with rare - earth ions can be a lasing medium  @xcite , and oscillators made thereof can be mode locked  @xcite to generate pulses as short as sub-30  fs  @xcite at the typical repetition rate higher than @xmath020  mhz  @xcite .",
    "amplification for generating high - photon - energy pulses can also be done by doped fibers  @xcite as well as by others such as external cavities  @xcite .",
    "the amplified pulses can be strong enough to be non - linearly converted up to 108  ev at 78  mhz  @xcite .",
    "the fiber lasers thus foresee the high - repetition - rate ultrafast spectroscopy in the deep - to - extreme ultraviolet region  @xcite ; already , they have been nourishing the ultrafast spectroscopy in the low - photon - energy regions such as thz  @xcite and multi - photon - photoemission methods  @xcite .",
    "besides , fiber lasers are compact because of the flexibility , stable due to the all - solid nature , and cost effective owing to the economics scale of the telecommunications industry .",
    "the paper describes what we believe is the first trpes apparatus based on a fiber laser system .",
    "one of the design concepts was to achieve a high repetition by utilizing yb - doped fibers .",
    "we adopted a mode - locked yb : fiber oscillator and a yb : fiber amplifier for generating 1.2-ev pump and 5.9-ev probe pulses at the 95-mhz repetition .",
    "non - linear crystals were used for generating the deep - ultraviolet probe , so that the laser system is all solid in nature .",
    "the repetition rate thus achieved is higher than the @xmath880  mhz of the ti : sapphire - based trpes apparatus  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energy resolution of 11.3  mev is comparable to 10.5  mev achieved in a 250-khz trpes apparatus  @xcite which took considerations into the uncertainty principle ; that is , to our knowledge , the yb : fiber - based apparatus is the second to demonstrate the sub-20-mev resolution in trpes .",
    "we show that the combination of the high repetition and high energy resolution is advantageous in detecting the subtle spectral changes induced by a weak pump fluence . besides , the yb : fiber laser system is compact and transportable , so that it can be easily installed into an existing trpes apparatus , as we shall demonstrate herein .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the present introduction ( section [ intro ] ) , we describe the setup and performance of the apparatus in section [ setup ] : the yb : fiber laser system is sketched in [ layout ] ; the energy ( 11.3  mev ) and time resolutions ( @xmath9310  fs ) are described in [ spacemirror ] and [ timer ] , respectively .",
    "the mitigation of the space - charge effects is also described in [ spacemirror ] . in section [ trpes ] ,",
    "we present trpes datasets of bismuth ( bi ) : trpes at @xmath1 as small as 30  nj / mm@xmath10 is demonstrated in [ polybi ] for a polycrystalline bi film ; in [ bifilm ] , we show the results of a highly - oriented bi film grown on graphite , the pump - and - probe response of which turned out to be useful for cross - correlating the pump and probe beams in real time even at the low pump fluence .",
    "finally , discussions are presented in section  [ conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "[ appendix_spacemirror ] , we present discussions of the mirror - charge effects that manifest when the fluence of the probe is low ; in appendix  [ appendix_bi ] , we describe the method to fabricate the highly - oriented bi thin films .",

    "the oscillator delivers pulses with a central wavelength of 1062  nm , a bandwidth of 22  nm , and an average power of @xmath020  mw .",
    "the seeding pulses are amplified in a yb - doped double - clad fiber pumped by a 976-nm diode laser .",
    "note , the fiber amplification is done without any reduction in the repetition rate , which is contrasted to the regenerative amplifications often adopted in ti : sapphire laser systems .",
    "we amplify the seed up to @xmath03  w , or up to @xmath030  nj / pulse , in order to generate sufficiently high flux of the fifth - harmonics probe ; see later .",

    "the analyzer chamber is shared by a trpes apparatus based on a ti : sapphire laser system delivering 1.5-ev pump and 5.8-ev probe pulses at 250-khz repetition  @xcite . because the probe beam of the yb : fiber and ti : sapphire systems happens to fall into the same photon energy region , the probe beam line is also shared by both systems .",
    "the arrival of the pump and probe pulses at the sample position is controlled by a delay stage inserted in the pump beam line .",

    "the space - charge broadening is an unwanted effect in photoemission spectroscopy , and has to be taken care of particularly when the probe light is pulsed .",
    "the flux of the probe beam has to be lowered until the spectral broadening becomes sufficiently small . here ,",
    "taking advantage that the apparatus is equipped with both 95-mhz yb : fiber and 250-khz ti : sapphire laser systems , we demonstrate that , when using the same amount of the probing photons per second , the 95-mhz system is less prone to the space - charge effects compared to the 250-khz system .",

    "first of all , the probing photon energy of the fiber - based system is higher only by 0.08  ev than that of the ti : sapphire system .",
    "therefore , the variations between the two setups in the matrix element , propagation velocity of the photoelectron bunch , and spectral window between the fermi cutoff and work - function cutoff ( appendix  [ appendix_spacemirror ] ) can be regarded as marginal . in both setups ,",
    "the spot diameter @xmath26 at the sample position was tuned to 130  @xmath4 m by utilizing the pin hole attached next to the sample  @xcite .",
    "we also quickly switched the system from ti : sapphire to yb : fiber during the measurement in order to minimize the change of the condition of the sample surface as well as that of the analyzer .",
    "the whole dataset to be presented in figure  [ fig_sc ] was acquired within one day . under these settings , we regarded the photoemission count rate from the gold sample as the measure of the probe - beam power , or the number of the probing photons per second , although in arbitrary units ; see below .",
    "the data were acquired in a normal - emission geometry .",

    "figures  [ fig_sc](a ) and [ fig_sc](b ) respectively show the fermi edge of polycrystalline gold recorded at various probe power values by the 250-khz and 95-mhz systems .",
    "we took the photoemission count rate at 50 @xmath23 15  mev below the fermi level ( @xmath28 ) as a measure of the probe power that was typically in the sub - mw range . the edge recorded by the 250-khz system [ [ fig_sc](a ) ] broadened and shifted into higher kinetic energy upon increasing the power because of the space - charge effects",
    "apparently , such a shift - and - broadening is small in the dataset recorded by the 95-mhz system [ [ fig_sc](b ) and [ fig_sc](c ) ] .",
    "the results demonstrate that the space - charge effects are less pronounced in the high - repetition 95-mhz system .",
    "the probe - power - dependent shifts of the fermi edge recorded by the 250-khz and 95-mhz systems are summarized in figure  [ fig_sc](d ) : the shifts were estimated by fitting the edge by fermi - dirac functions convoluted with gaussian functions .",
    "we here note that the low probing photon energy of @xmath06  ev is advantageous for reducing the space - charge effects when the number of the photoelectrons consisting the bunch is concerned . at @xmath06",
    "ev , only the electrons bound near the valence - band maximum can be emitted as photoelectrons , because the spectral cutoff due to the work function is located in the valence - band region ; see appendix  [ appendix_spacemirror ] .",
    "therefore , the number of the valence electrons that can be photo - emitted is intrinsically small at @xmath06  ev compared to the cases for higher photon energies .",
    "qualitatively , the suppression of the space charge effects at low probing photon energy is acknowledged in time - resolved multi - photon photoelectron spectroscopy  @xcite , although quantitative comparison to the present results is difficult because the photon energy of the pulses as well as other conditions is different in general .",
    "looking closer into the dataset recorded by the 95-mhz system [ [ fig_sc](c ) ] , we observe that , upon increasing the probe power , the edge initially shifts into low kinetic energies before shifting into high kinetic energies . when the spot diameter @xmath26 was reduced from 130 to 90  @xmath4 m ,",
    "the magnitude of the initial shift into lower kinetic energies was increased , as shown in figure  [ fig_sc](d ) .",
    "the shift into low kinetic energy upon increasing the probe power is most likely attributed to mirror - charge effects  @xcite that manifested when the space - charge effects were reduced . for further discussion , see appendix  [ appendix_spacemirror ] .",

    "the energy resolution [ fwhm of the gaussian ] was estimated to be 11.3 @xmath23 0.3  mev .",
    "the energy resolution is comparable to that of the 250-khz ti : sapphire - based system ( 10.5  mev )  @xcite , whose design concept was to achieve a high energy resolution by considering the uncertainty principle : a compromise has to be done in the time resolution when pursuing the energy resolution .",

    "these include : the pin - hole method for directing the pump and probe beams to the sample position at a controlled beam size ; the method to visualize the infrared pump and ultraviolet probe beams simultaneously ; the know - hows to stabilize the laser , temperature , and sample position ; the repetitive delay scanning during the data acquisition ; and to use not - too - short pulses to keep a fair resolution in energy . a method developed uniquely for yb : fiber trpes was to use bi(111)/hopg as a reference sample .",
    "the giant response of the surface states on bi(111 ) enabled us to cross - correlate the pump and probe pulses at the sample position in real time even when the pump fluence was as low as @xmath42 30  nj / mm@xmath2 .",

    "the shift and broadening of the spectrum as a function of the probing photon flux occur due to the combination of the space- and mirror - charge effects  @xcite .",
    "the effects depend on a variety of parameters such as  @xcite : ( 1 ) the number of the photoelectrons @xmath43 forming a bunch ; ( 2 ) the pulse length ; ( 3 ) the size and shape of the probe beam ; ( 4 ) the energy distribution of the photoelectrons that depends on the valence band structure of the sample and photon energy of the probe ; and ( 5 ) the conductivity of the sample . concerning the shift , the space - charge and mirror - charge effects , respectively , cause an upward and downward shift of the fermi cutoff in kinetic energy ; the latter occurs because the photoelectron bunch is effectively attracted by its own mirror charge induced in the metal sample .",
    "the dominance of the downward shift of the cutoff in the low - flux region , as seen in figures  [ fig_sc](c ) and [ fig_sc](d ) , can be understood by considering @xmath43 @xmath44 1 : in the limiting case , there is no space - charge effects but only the mirror - charge effects . to date , however , only upward shifts have been reported when the duration of the probing pulses are in the femtoseconds  @xcite ; downward shift is reported only when the pulse duration is @xmath060  ps  @xcite .",
    "thus , the observation of the downward shift resolves the mystery why the signatures of mirror - charge effects were not observed for the trpes probe in the femtoseconds .",
    "the successful observation presumably owes to the followings : ( 1 ) the photon energy of the probe is as low as 5.9  ev , so that only the electrons bound near @xmath28 can contribute to the photoelectrons ; that is , @xmath43 is intrinsically small compared to the cases when the probes have higher photon energies ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_photoneng ] .",
    "( 2 ) the high energy resolution of @xmath920  mev and high s / n facilitated us to discern the downward shift as small as 1  mev .",
    "the observation of the downward shift in femtosecond trpes nicely connects into the regime of mutli - photon photoelectron spectroscopy where the mirror - charge effects dominate over the space - charge effects  @xcite because it usually deals with very low - kinetic - energy photoelectrons generated by the low - fluence pulses .",
    "density of states , photon energy of the probe @xmath45 , and spectral cutoff due to the work function .",
    "the work - function cutoff occurs in the valence - band region when @xmath45 is low and fulfills the condition @xmath46 ( upper two panels ) . here , @xmath47 ( @xmath05  ev ) is the work function , and @xmath48 ( @xmath010  ev ) is the width of the valence band in energy . as @xmath45 is increased ( from top to bottom ) ,",
    "the gray shaded energy window @xmath49 expands , and the fermi cutoff shifts away from the work - function cutoff in the valence - band spectrum .",

    "we describe the method to obtain the highly - oriented bi(111 ) micro - crystalline thin film .",
    "vacuum - evaporated bi on cleaved surface of hopg forms micro - crystals with the 111 face oriented normal to the surface  @xcite .",
    "because hopg consists of micron - sized graphite sheets randomly oriented in plane as shown in figure  [ fig_bigrowth](a ) , the bi micro - crystals grown on hopg also have random in - plane orientation , as we describe below .",
    "first , we obtain a clean surface of hopg by using the scotch - tape method  @xcite . the tape attached on hopg",
    "is peeled off in the vacuum chamber for sample preparation .",
    "the vacuum can be at the level of @xmath05 @xmath12 10@xmath54  torr . in figure  [ fig_bigrowth](b )",
    ", we show the snapshots taken during the removal of the tape .",
    "note , the demonstration is done in air . to our experience ,",
    "the tape is compatible to ultrahigh vacuum unless baked .",
    "the scotch - tape method nicely works as long as the cleaving is done around the room temperature . at cryogenic temperatures",
    ", the tape hardens , so that it becomes less successful to have a good cleave .",
    "next , we evaporate bi on the exposed surface of hopg .",
    "the evaporator consists of an alumina crucible heated by a tungsten filament , and is equipped in the preparation chamber .",
    "the typical thickness of the film , after @xmath030-min evaporation , is more than 1000   , as judged by the color of the copper sample holder deposited by bi .",
    "the vacuum level can be of the order of @xmath05 @xmath12 10@xmath54  torr during the deposition ; that is , an ultra - high vacuum of @xmath5510  @xmath56  torr is not necessary .",
    "subsequently , the sample is transferred into the analyzer chamber without exposure to air . here , we anneal the sample following a procedure described in figure  [ fig_bigrowth](c )",
    ". the sample is heated by using a ceramic heater , whose main usage is to control the temperature of the sample during arpes measurements . in figure  [ fig_bigrowth](d ) , we show arpes images monitored during the heating - and - cooling sequence .",
    "the image recorded on the as - deposited sample [ the left - most column in figure  [ fig_bigrowth](d ) ] already shows bands typical to bi(111 ) surface , although some other features also exist ; see later . upon raising the temperature across @xmath0340  k ,",
    "the bands in the image become sharp , indicating that the film is annealed .",
    "similar annealing occurs around 340  k in a bi film deposited on si(111)-7@xmath127 surface  @xcite .",
    "we heat the sample up to 365  k to ensure a homogeneous annealing .",
    "then the sample is cooled down to 305  k. one can see that some features in the image are removed after the annealing , such as the band occurring near @xmath28 around the normal emission ( emission angle around 0@xmath57 ) . as the sample is further cooled down to 5  k , the bands in the image become even more sharp [ right - most column of figure  [ fig_bigrowth](d ) ] .    in figure  [ fig_bigrowth](e ) , we show constant - energy maps of the angular distributions of the photoelectrons emitted from the bi film grown on hopg . a debye - ring - like distribution is observed in the maps .",
    "this shows that the film consists of bi micro - crystals whose 111 faces are oriented normal to the surface , while their orientations being random in plane .",
    "the highly oriented structure is similar to that of hopg , as shown in figure  [ fig_bigrowth](a ) .",
    "the hexagonally - warped band dispersions of bi(111 ) are thus averaged out in the azimuth to result in the ring - shaped photoelectron distributions in the maps .",
    "we find that the surface of the bi film thus obtained is extraordinary stable .",
    "the bands in the arpes image were observable even after the sample had been kept in the preparation chamber for two months .",
    "even when the surface had acquired residual gas in the vacuum chamber at cryogenic temperatures , the sharp bands in the arpes image were recovered after raising the sample temperature to 300  k. however , once the sample was exposed to air , the bands were not observable any more .    the high stability of the surface , besides the ease in the sample preparation , make the highly - oriented bi(111)/hopg a convenient reference sample for trpes .",
    "we use the tarpes signal of the film when searching for and fine - tuning the spatio - temporal overlap of the pump and probe pulses at the focal point of the electron analyzer , as described in sec .",
