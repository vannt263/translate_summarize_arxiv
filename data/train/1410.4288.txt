    "stars and brown dwarfs in the immediate solar neighborhood ( @xmath11  pc ; @xcite ) are ideal targets for detailed investigations of the structural , atmospheric and populative properties of these objects .",
    "this is particularly true for the very lowest - mass ( vlm ) and lowest - luminosity dwarfs  the late - m , l , t and y dwarfs  whose recent discovery has been facilitated by wide - area red and infrared imaging surveys ( e.g. , 2mass , denis , sdss , ukidss , wise ) and multi - epoch red and infrared astrometry ( e.g. , lspm , supercosmos , allwise ) . yet , despite their apparent brightness and high proper motion , up to @xmath1020% of our nearest ( @xmath1220  pc ) vlm neighbors remain `` missing '' , particularly toward the galactic plane @xcite , as exemplified by the very recent discovery of the third ( luhman  16ab ; @xcite ) and fourth ( wise j085510.83 - 071442.5 ; @xcite ) closest systems to the sun , comprised of l , t and y dwarfs .",

    "brown dwarf companions to late - m primaries consistently outnumber stellar companions in our simulation ; in contrast , only @xmath109% of systems with mid - m ( m4m7 ) primaries host t dwarf companions .",

    "even with the prevalence of t dwarf companions to late - m primaries , the incidence of finding 2 or more t dwarf companions in the nearby sample  and only t dwarf companions  remains low , plateauing around 1.4% for a total binary fraction 10% @xmath12 @xmath84 @xmath12 25% . the local sample would seem to be an anomaly if the underlying multiplicity distributions are accurately characterized .",
    "it is possible that more ( and less ) massive companions to other late m dwarfs in the nearby sample have yet to be found , and may be uncovered astrometrically with the current gaia mission .",
    "we also note that while this specific configuration is rare , there are roughly 10@xmath85 10-pc `` bubbles '' in the 312  kpc galactic disk , making our sample of m dwarfs one of a million .",
    "finally , we note that the peak probability of exclusively t dwarf companions to late m dwarfs occurs in a range of @xmath84 consistent with previous determinations of the vlm binary fraction @xcite .",
    "this is significant , as the decline in frequency at high fractions is caused by increased contamination by earlier - type secondaries .",
    "the lack of such companions in the nearby sample may be a consequence of the low binary fraction of vlm dwarfs compared to more massive stars .",
    "the companionship of late - m dwarfs appears to be determined by the confluence of four key statistics of vlm dwarfs : the mass function across the substellar limit , the cooling rate of brown dwarfs , the mass ratio distribution of vlm dwarfs , and the underlying multiplicity fraction .",
    "the importance of these statistics for brown dwarf formation and interior theories motivates a complete assessment of the multiplicity properties of late m dwarfs in a much larger volume .",
    "we have conducted a detailed investigation of the recently identified , nearby vlm dwarf wise  j0720@xmath00846 . from optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopic investigations , we have determined the optical and near - infrared classifications of this source , improved its astrometry , measured its spatial kinematics and rotational velocity , identified persistent and flaring magnetic activity , and found evidence for a brown dwarf companion .",
    "the reduced level of activity in this source compared to other late - m dwarfs , and its old disk kinematics , both suggest that this is a relatively mature system .",
    "the putative t dwarf companion , identified in combined - light spectroscopy and possibly resolved at 1  au projected separation , will aid in constraining the age , as astrometric and radial velocity monitoring over the next few years should allow us to map the orbit of the system and extract individual component masses .",
    "remarkably , this is one of only two binaries among late m dwarfs in the immediate vicinity of the sun , and both have t dwarf companions .",
    "we argue that , while rare , this may reflect a combination of the proximity of the primary to the hbmm , the evolutionary properties of brown dwarfs , and the underlying binary fraction , making multiplicity studies of late m dwarfs a potentially useful window into brown dwarf formation and evolution theories .",

    "we examined 1081 periods in the period range 4  hr @xmath89 16  hr , sampled evenly in frequency space in steps of @xmath90 . for each period , we phase - folded the lightcurve , computed a mean curve sampled at @xmath91 = 100 linearly - spaced phase points , then computed the @xmath39 deviation of the phased data relative to the mean curve .",
    "the statistic of merit is the ratio @xmath92 where @xmath93 is measured from the unphased lightcurve , and @xmath94 = 5895 is the total number of data points .",
    "following @xcite , we assessed the significance of minima in @xmath95 using the regularized incomplete beta function @xmath30 : @xmath96^{1/n_f}\\ ] ] here , pr@xmath97 is the false - alarm probability when @xmath71 is less than some value 0 @xmath98 1 by chance ; 1-pr gives the significance of a period corresponding to a minimum in @xmath71 .",

    "periods with 1-pr @xmath32 90% were deemed significant , but no features in the cleaned and normalized light curve satisfied this limit .",
    "to quantify the companion detection limits from our radial velocity observations , and determine whether the candidate companion identified in nirc2 imaging data is consistent with these limits , we performed a pair of monte carlo orbit simulations .",
    "the first simulation aimed to determine the range of orbital semimajor axes that would have been detected given the radial velocity measurement uncertainties and sampling .",

    "we then solved for the maximum radial velocity amplitude of the primary component ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath108 with component masses m@xmath78 and m@xmath23 estimated from the evolutionary models of @xcite , system ages of 0.5 , 1 , 5 and 10  gyr , and component t@xmath58s of 2300  k and 1100  k for wise  j0720@xmath00846a and b based on the t@xmath58/spectral type relation of @xcite ( table  [ tab : rvsim ] ) .",
    "the observed radial motion of the primary at each nirspec or hamilton epoch @xmath109 ( these datasets were modeled separately ) was then calculated as @xmath110 where @xmath111 relates the true anomaly @xmath88 to the eccentric anomaly @xmath112 , which is in turn related to the mean anomaly through kepler s equation : @xmath113 here , @xmath114 is the period of the orbit , determined from the estimated masses , input semimajor axis , and kepler s period law ; and @xmath115 is the time since periastron passage . setting @xmath116 = 0 and @xmath117 = 0 ( the time of the nirc2 image ) , we can set @xmath118 and solve for the primary velocities numerically .    for each simulated orbit , we calculated @xmath39 for the radial velocity epochs relative to their mean , using the corresponding observational uncertainties .",
    "we then determined the fraction of orbits that exceeded our measured @xmath39 as a function of semi - major axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvsim ] displays the results of this calculation for the nirspec data and a system age of 1  gyr . due to inclination variations and sampling , detection probabilities never reach 100% ; we therefore use 50% and 80% probabilities of detection as our thresholds .    to add in the constraint of a possible detection of the companion at a projected separation of @xmath119",

    "we performed another monte carlo simulation to assess the likelihood of finding two or more t dwarf companions ( exclusively ) in the sample of 13 m7m9.5 dwarfs within 10  pc of the sun ( table  [ tab : latem ] ) .",
    "we started with a sample of @xmath94 = 10@xmath38 primaries with uniform ages spanning 0.57  gyr ( corresponding to the typical ages of disk stars ) and masses 0.013  m@xmath55 @xmath129 m @xmath129 0.2  m@xmath55 distributed as a power - law mass function @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "for each system we assigned a secondary mass using the power - law mass ratio distribution of @xcite , @xmath131 , based on bayesian analysis of vlm imaging samples ; this distribution favors equal - mass systems .",
    "the component masses and system ages were transformed to bolometric luminosities using the evolutionary models of @xcite , and these converted into spectral types by combining the spectral type / absolute @xmath15-band magnitude relation of @xcite with the spectral type/@xmath15-band bolometric correction relation of @xcite .",
    "systems with component spectral types outside the range m5-t9 were rejected .",
    "we selected a subset of m7-m9.5 sources ( 4626 systems ) and used these as the primaries for our random - draw experiment .",
