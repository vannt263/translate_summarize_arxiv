    "the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electroweak interactions is being tested by present high - energy colliders for energies @xmath2 200 gev and proved to describe the corresponding interactions with great accuracy . by the same token",
    "those experiments are putting limits on the scale of new physics , suggesting thus that extra matter , if it exists , is only relevant in the tev scale range .",
    "in particular these limits do apply to the best motivated of the phenomenological low - energy extensions of the sm , its minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) , putting bounds around the tev on the mass of the supersymmetric partners . on the other hand , the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism remains as the missing building block of the sm , or any low energy extension thereof , given the fact that the higgs field has been shown so elusive in all experiments to the present day . in the context of the mssm the problems of the origin and stability of the ewsb scale are alleviated because the latter is related to the scale of supersymmetry breaking , and it is further protected against radiative corrections by supersymmetry : the sensitivity of the higgs squared - mass to the high scale is not quadratic ( as in the case of the sm ) but only logarithmic .",
    "however the origin of supersymmetry breaking remains as the big unsolved problem in these theories .",
    "the presence of supersymmetry in the low - energy extension of the sm is further supported by the fact that consistent fundamental theories aiming to unify gauge and gravitational interactions at high scales ( string theories ) are supersymmetric .",
    "a common feature of these theories is the presence of ( compactified ) extra dimensions .",
    "if all dimensions are small , of the order of the planck or gut length , their detectability is outside the scope of present or future accelerators . however if some radii are larger , they might have a number of theoretical and phenomenological implications  @xcite-@xcite .    from the fundamental point of view the presence of large extra dimensions",
    "has been proved to be essential to describe the strong coupling regime of certain string theories  @xcite , while tev scale superstrings have been constructed  @xcite . from the more phenomenological point of view",
    "the presence of large dimensions can play a prominent role for gauge coupling unification  @xcite , for neutrino mass generation  @xcite , to provide possible alternative solutions to the hierarchy problem  @xcite-@xcite , and as a transmitter of supersymmetry breaking between different boundaries  @xcite . on the other hand theories with a tev higher dimensional planck scale predict modifications of gravitational measurements in the sub - millimeter range  @xcite , while some features of tev - scale quantum gravity theories have recently been worked out  @xcite .",
    "finally experimental detection of tev radii in future accelerators has been proposed as an unambiguous signature of large extra dimensions  @xcite .    in the above theoretical constructions ,",
    "where compactification scales are in the tev range , it is therefore tempting to assume that both the compactification scale of large dimensions and the scale of supersymmetry breaking have a common origin .",
    "this is the case if supersymmetry is broken by a continuous compactification along the compact dimension by means of the so - called scherk - schwarz ( ss ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the ss mechanism has been recently used to break supersymmetry in sectors with which we only share gravitational  @xcite interactions ( gravity mediated scenarios ) and also in sectors that share gauge interactions with the observable sector  @xcite-@xcite ( gauge mediated scenarios ) .    in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the latter scenarios , where both the compactification and the supersymmetry breaking scales are in the tev range and can then leave a characteristic signature in the present or next generation of high - energy colliders : these scenarios will in this way be testable in the near future .",
    "in particular we will concentrate in simple five - dimensional ( 5d ) models where ss compactification acts on the fifth dimension , as those presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the main features of electroweak and supersymmetry breaking already appear . in this sense",
    "our approach will be a bottom - up one , but keeping in mind that it might possibly appear in compactifications of some more fundamental higher dimensional theory .",
    "however , as we will see the resulting low energy theory will show very little sensitivity to the physics at the high scale ( cutoff ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will present the simplest mssm extension in 5d , compactified on @xmath6 , along the lines of the model analyzed in refs .",
    "all non - chiral matter ( the gauge and higgs sectors ) will be placed on the bulk of the fifth dimension while chiral matter ( chiral fermion supermultiplets ) live on the 4d boundaries .",
    "the corresponding 5d and 4d tree - level lagrangians and their interactions are explicitly written in subsections 2.1 and 2.2 , including contact interactions , between fields in the bulk and the boundary , which are necessary for the consistency of the theory .",
    "supersymmetry is broken by the ss mechanism in the bulk , using the @xmath7 @xmath0-symmetry of the @xmath8 supersymmetry algebra .",
    "the resulting massless spectrum contains just the sm particle content plus the sfermions living on the boundary that do not have excitations along the fifth dimension and thus do not receive any mass from the ss mechanism . one - loop radiative corrections will be studied in section 3 for the bulk , subsection 3.1 , and the boundary , subsection 3.2 . in the bulk the one - loop effective potential , in the background of the higgs field zero - mode , is computed and found to have a closed analytic form in terms of polylogarithm functions .",
    "the higgs squared - mass at the origin is computed by diagrammatic methods and shown to agree with that obtained from the effective potential : it is positive definite in the minimal mssm extension , which asks for radiative corrections on the boundary to trigger electroweak symmetry breaking ( a common procedure in theories where supersymmetry breaking is gauge mediated to the squark and slepton sector ) .",
    "radiative corrections on the boundary are computed in subsection 3.2 by using diagrammatic methods .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gauge and yukawa interactions from the bulk to the boundary .",
    "explicit expressions are given for soft - breaking terms .",
    "in particular soft masses for sfermions and trilinear soft - breaking couplings are computed . due to the presence of the fifth dimension",
    "the breaking is extremely soft and does not depend at all on the details of the ultraviolet physics .",
    "the soft masses can then be predicted as a function of a unique @xmath0-charge .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is analyzed in section 4 .",
    "it is triggered ( as in gauge mediation ) by two - loop corrections induced on the higgs mass at the origin from sfermion soft masses on the boundary .",
    "these corrections are numerically relevant , due to the smallness of the bulk - generated positive higgs squared - mass , and must be the leading two - loop corrections to the effective potential .",
    "minimization of the whole effective potential leads to electroweak symmetry breaking at the correct scale with a light sm - like higgs and very heavy supersymmetric particles .",
    "the rough features of the mass spectrum are as follows : the higgs mass is bounded by @xmath2 110 gev , squarks and sleptons have masses @xmath9 1 tev while heavy higgses , gauginos and higgsinos weigh @xmath9 10 tev .",
    "the model does not have any @xmath3-problem in the sense that the ss mechanism provides an effective @xmath3-parameter @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "it predicts a light higgs , which means that it can be probed in lep , and a right - handed slepton as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which can generate a cosmological problem unless @xmath0-parity is broken or there are light right - handed neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "other alternative models with heavier higgses and a neutralino as lsp have been discussed in section 5 .",
    "the most obvious possibility is having the chiral and gauge sector living in the bulk of the fifth dimension and the higgs sector on the boundaries .",
    "these models suffer from the @xmath3-problem and present some experimental peculiarities .",
    "finally the issue of unification in the presence of ss supersymmetry breaking has been studied in section 6 .",
    "we have shown that gauge coupling running for the theory with ss supersymmetry breaking proceeds as in supersymmetric theories .",
    "in particular we have shown that the dependence of the gauge coupling running on the ss breaking parameters is extremely tiny , and corresponds to one part in @xmath11 .",
    "section 7 contains our conclusions and appendices a and b are devoted to present some technical details corresponding to the problem of gauge - fixing in the 5d theory and the calculation of the effective potential .",
    "in this section we present a simple model based on an @xmath12 5d theory compactified on @xmath6 .",
    "the gauge sector and the non - chiral matter live in the bulk of the fifth dimension . in the minimal model",
    "the non - chiral matter consists on the higgs sector . in non - minimal models",
    "we could add any vector - like extra matter , as e.g. @xmath13 triplets or complete @xmath14 representations plus their anti - particles . in what follows",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the minimal model .",
    "4d chiral multiplets , with well defined renormalizable interactions with themselves and with the bulk fields , live on the 4d boundaries ( fixed points of the orbifold @xmath6 ) .",
    "the reason for having the chiral matter on the boundary is not chirality , that can be preserved by the @xmath15-projection , but the fact that chiral fermions in the bulk would not receive any mass from the electroweak breaking mechanism due to the underlying @xmath8 4d symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "the gauge fields in the 5d bulk belong to the vector supermultiplet @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are the generators in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath18 and @xmath19 the corresponding gauge couplings .",

    "the higgs fields belong to the hypermultiplets @xmath27 ( an @xmath13-doublet with hypercharge @xmath28 ) whose superindex @xmath29 transforms as the doublet of a global group @xmath30 .",

    "upon compactification of the theory on @xmath6 the 5d fields are classified under the @xmath15 parity into even and odd fields .",
    "the even fields are the vector multiplet @xmath36 and the chiral multiplets @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "the @xmath15 parity projects out half of the states .",

    "] this model predicts a rather heavy spectrum of supersymmetric particles with the characteristic feature that the lsp is the right - handed selectron , due to the fact that supersymmetry breaking is transmitted via gauge interactions .",
    "having the right - handed selectron as the lsp presents some cosmological difficulties .",
    "a possible way out is that r - parity is violated , so as the lsp is not stable .",
    "other possibilities were discussed in ref .",
    "we must remark that the results on the light higgs mass are quite sensitive to the value of @xmath43 in eq .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] nevertheless , this model is phenomenologically problematic since in the limit @xmath47 the theory has a residual symmetry that does not allow for an @xmath51 mixing term ( i.e. , @xmath52 in the mssm language ) and therefore the vev of @xmath53 is zero . to see that notice that for @xmath47 the higgsino @xmath54 kk - mode ( in table  [ masas ] ) is degenerated with the @xmath55 kk - mode , and the @xmath56 kk - mode with the @xmath57",
    "therefore the theory in the bulk and the boundary is invariant under the discrete transformation @xmath58 this symmetry implies @xmath59 and @xmath60 and consequently no mixing - mass term between the mssm higgses can be generated at any loop order .",
    "note also that in the limit @xmath47 the theory has also an @xmath0-symmetry , since the two majorana gauginos @xmath61 and @xmath62 can combine to form a dirac fermion .",
    "consequently the trilinear terms ( [ at ] ) are not generated in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "in this section we want to present a different possibility from the model studied above .",
    "we will assume quarks and leptons live in the bulk but the two higgs supermultiplets live on the boundary .",
    "this possibility , although it suffers from the @xmath3-problem , presents a different and interesting phenomenology .",

    "we can again use the ss - mechanism to break supersymmetry .",
    "taking @xmath67 , the squarks and sleptons get masses at the tree - level equal to @xmath68 , and the massless sector in the bulk corresponds to the sm fermions and ( as in the model above ) to the sm gauge bosons .",

    "the higgsinos are the lsps .",
    "since the gaugino mass is very large , the charged higgsino will be slightly heavier than the neutral higgsino , with a mass difference of few gevs @xcite .",
