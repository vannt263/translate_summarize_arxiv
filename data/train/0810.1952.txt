    "despite the success of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics in describing electroweak physics below @xmath1 100 gev in terms of a non - abelian gauge theory with spontaneously broken @xmath2 gauge group , the gauge symmetry does not predict the precise mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) . indeed , up to this moment , there is no direct experimental signal of the mechanism of ewsb , being its search one of the main goals of the lhc .",
    "the ewsb mechanism plays an important role in the high energy electroweak gauge boson scattering which violates partial wave unitarity or becomes strongly interacting at energies of the order of @xmath3 tev , if there is no new state to cut off its growth  @xcite . in the context of the sm , as well as in its supersymmetric realization ,",
    "electroweak symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value of some weakly coupled neutral scalar state(s ) , the higgs boson(s ) , which will contribute to electroweak gauge boson scattering , preventing the unitarity violation of the process .    alternatively , _",
    "extensions of the sm  @xcite have been proposed in which the electroweak symmetry is broken without involving a fundamental higgs field . generically on these models ,",
    "the electroweak symmetry is broken by boundary conditions in a higher dimensional space .",
    "the originally proposed higgsless models gave large contributions to precision electroweak observables , in particular to the @xmath4 parameter  @xcite ( @xmath5  @xcite )  @xcite .",
    "such problems could be overcome , for example , by appropriate modifications of the fermion sector . in this way",
    ", a variety of higgsless models have been constructed  @xcite which ensure agreement with electroweak precision data .    from the point of view of unitarity ,",
    "all higgsless models share the common feature that new weakly interacting spin-1 gauge bosons particles with the same quantum numbers as the sm gauge bosons appear and they are responsible for the partial restoration of unitarity in vector boson scattering and for rendering a theory weakly coupled to energies well above 2 tev  @xcite .",
    "this property allows for an almost model independent search for the lightest charged resonance @xmath6 at the lhc through @xmath7 or via weak boson fusion @xmath8",
    "@xcite , as long as @xmath6 remains a narrow resonance .",
    "the lhc experiments will be able to unravel the existence of the charged state via these processes with modest integrated luminosities of 1060 fb@xmath0 .",
    "on the contrary , the corresponding search for the neutral vector resonance in gauge boson fusion is expected to be very difficult , since a generic feature of this class of models is the absence of coupling between the neutral resonance and @xmath9 pairs .",
    "reconstructing the heavy neutral vector resonance decaying into @xmath10 requires at least one hadronic @xmath11 decay , posing the challenge to dig it out from the large sm backgrounds .    once a clear signal of the charged resonance is observed in the above channels , it is mandatory to study its spin to confirm that the new state is indeed a vector particle . in this work ,",
    "our goal is to probe the @xmath6 spin via the study of weak boson fusion production of @xmath6 with its subsequent decay into leptons , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 or @xmath15 , considering final states where the @xmath11 s and @xmath16 s decay into different and same flavor charged leptons . to determine the spin of the state decaying into @xmath17 we contrast the final state distributions arising from the production and decay of the vector charged state with the ones stemming from the decay of a scalar state ;",
    "_ i.e. _ we work in the framework commonly used to analyze the spin of supersymmetric particles  @xcite . here",
    "we show that it is possible to determine the spin of a new heavy resonance decaying into @xmath17 at the lhc with 99% cl for luminosities of @xmath1 150560 fb@xmath0 , depending on the particle mass and the method used in the analysis .",
    "the restoration of partial wave unitarity in higgsless models is due to new kaluza ",
    "klein resonances @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the couplings @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) have the same lorentz structure of the sm @xmath22 vertex with a coupling constant @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . in order to cancel the dangerous terms in the scattering @xmath25 that depend on @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy of the incoming @xmath11 and @xmath16 in the center  of - mass system",
    ", the new vector state coupling constants must satisfy the following constraints : @xmath29\\;. \\label{const2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eqs .",
    "( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ const2 ] ) constrain the couplings of the lightest charged kaluza - klein state to @xmath30 pairs , @xmath31 in our analysis we assume that this bound is saturated @xcite , which leads to the largest allowed value for @xmath32 , and we evaluate the quartic coupling @xmath33 using eq .",
    "( [ const1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we assume that the @xmath6 couplings to fermions are small and that the @xmath6 s mainly decay into @xmath30 pairs .",
    "this hypothesis is , in fact , realized in some higgsless models  @xcite .",
    "our study of the @xmath6 spin was carried out by comparing the kinematic distributions of its decay products with the predictions for the production of a spin-0 resonance .",
    "since the signal for the new charged state is characterized by peak in the @xmath30 invariant mass distribution , we use as template the kinematic distributions in a model which is the sm without a higgs plus a scalar charged state , @xmath34 , with an interaction @xmath35 .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath36 vertex is chosen such that the @xmath34 production cross section is equal to the one for @xmath6 after all cuts .",
    "we also set the @xmath34 width equal to the @xmath6 one .",
    "we performed a parton level study using the full tree level amplitude for the final state processes in order to keep track of spin correlations .",
    "the matrix elements were generated using the package madgraph  @xcite , where we included the higgsless ( and template ) model particles and interactions .",
    "we employed the cteq6l parton distribution functions  @xcite with the factorization scale @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the transverse momenta of the tagging jets . for the qcd backgrounds we chose the renormalization scale @xmath39 . in order to have a crude simulation of the detector performance we smeared energies , but not directions , of all final state partons with a gaussian error .",
    "for the jets , we assumed a resolution @xmath40 , if @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , if @xmath43 ( @xmath28 in gev ) , while for charged leptons we used a resolution @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , we considered the jet tagging efficiency to be @xmath45 , while the lepton detection efficiency is taken to be @xmath46 .",
    "we analyzed the process @xmath47 which contains the contribution of the vector boson fusion production of new charged resonances decaying into leptons ; see eq .",
    "( [ eq : procsignal ] ) .",
    "this process possesses a significant irreducible background originating from electroweak and qcd @xmath48 production .",
    "moreover , the production of @xmath49 pair in association with a jet exhibits a large cross section after we demand the presence of two tagging jets  @xcite and can lead to trilepton events when both @xmath50 s decay semi - leptonically and the decay of one of the @xmath51 s leads to an isolated lepton is smaller than 10 gev ] .",
    "initially we imposed the following jet acceptance cuts designed to enhance events produced by vector boson fusion , @xmath52    we also applied lepton acceptance and isolation cuts @xmath53    .sm background and signal cross sections after different set of cuts in fb . in the last column the top / bottom results is obtained applying the top / bottom cut in eq .",
    "( [ cuts3 ] ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see from table  [ tab : disc ] the sm background is still quite large after these cuts with the @xmath54 production being the dominant contribution . in order to reduce this background we explore two features of the signal and backgrounds .",
    "first of all , in the @xmath55 production the lepton coming from the @xmath51 semi - leptonic decay is quite soft , therefore , it can be reduced by imposing an additional lepton transverse momentum cut : @xmath56 moreover , two of the leptons in the signal come from a @xmath16 decay , consequently we also required that the events present a pair of same flavor opposite charge leptons ( sfoc ) with an invariant mass in a window around the @xmath16 mass .",
    "thus we further demanded @xmath57    the presence of just one neutrino in the signal final state , eq .",
    "( [ eq : procsignal ] ) , allows for full reconstruction of the neutrino momentum  up to a twofold ambiguity on its longitudinal component  by imposing the transverse momentum conservation and requiring that the invariant mass of the neutrino@xmath58 pair , where @xmath13 is the charged lepton not identified as coming from the @xmath16 decay , is compatible with the @xmath11 mass : @xmath59 p_l^l \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\pm   \\sqrt{\\big[m_w^2 + 2(\\vec{p_t^l } \\cdot \\vec{{/\\!\\!\\!p_t}})\\big]^2 |\\vec p^l|^2 - 4 ( p_t^l e^l{/\\!\\!\\!\\!e_t})^2}\\bigg\\ } \\label{eq : plnu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , there are two distinct estimates for the @xmath30 invariant mass which we label @xmath60 and @xmath61 the maximum and minimum reconstructed values , respectively .",
    "we show in left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mwz ] the @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as well as the true @xmath62 invariant mass distributions for @xmath63 gev . as seen in the figure , both reconstructed distributions present a clear peak associated to the presence of a new charged resonance .",
    "moreover , the maximum ( minimum ) reconstructed @xmath30 invariant mass is a reasonable estimator of the true distribution for @xmath30 invariant masses smaller ( larger ) than the position of the resonance .    in order to isolate the contribution of the new charged states , we imposed a cut on @xmath61 @xmath64 the effect of these cuts on the @xmath30 invariant mass spectrum can be seen in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mwz ] for @xmath63 gev and 700 gev . as",
    "seen in the figure after these cuts , a good fraction of the peak signal events are retained .    the predicted cross sections for the signal and sm backgrounds after cuts ( [ cuts1])([cuts3 ] ) are listed in table  [ tab : disc ] . from these numbers we conclude that the above cuts lead to a good signal to background ratio of @xmath65 ( 1.5 ) for @xmath66 ( 700 ) gev .",
    "thus , a clear observation ( @xmath67 ) of the new charged resonances @xmath6 with a 500 ( 700 ) gev mass in the leptonic channel requires a modest integrated luminosity of 15 ( 66 ) fb@xmath0 , which can be achieved in the low luminosity run of the lhc or in the early stages of the high luminosity run .",
    "similar sensitivity could be obtained by cutting , instead , on @xmath68 , though in general the cuts have to be chosen tighter and dependent on the @xmath69 mass .",
    "this is so because the sm background is a decreasing function of the @xmath30 mass , therefore when cutting on the maximum reconstructed @xmath30 mass , the number of miss  reconstructed background events in the signal region tends to be larger .",
    "after the new state coupled to @xmath30 is discovered , it is important to probe its spin . the best way to accomplish that is to study angular correlations of the final state particles . in principle , useful information on the spin could be also extracted from the production cross section , however , at the lhc one measures the production cross section times the decay branching ratio , requiring additional information to disentangle these quantities . here",
    "we employ two methods to unravel the spin of the new charged state based exclusively on the kinematic distribution of the final state particles . in the first method , we contrast the kinematic distributions of the charged leptons produced in the decay of vector and scalar charged states , much in the spirit of the analysis carried out to study the spin of supersymmetric particles at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "a virtue of this method is that it does not rely on the reconstruction of the neutrino momentum ( besides the invariant mass cut ) . in our second analysis",
    ", we used the reconstructed neutrino momentum to obtain the polar angle of the produced @xmath16 s in the @xmath30 center  of  mass system .    in order to contrast the spin-0 and spin-1 resonances , we focused on the leptons whose momenta can be well determined . in previous studies",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that a convenient variable for such analysis is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the rapidity difference between the same charge leptons .",
    "notice that this quantity is invariant under longitudinal boosts .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : barr ] the expected @xmath72 distributions for the sm background and the production of scalar and vector resonances with mass 500 ( 700 ) gev in the left ( right ) panel after cuts ( [ cuts1])([cuts3 ] ) . in obtaining this figure",
    ", we imposed that the cross section for the production of spin-0 resonances is the same of the one for spin-1 states .",
    "we also display the sm background alone to show its impact on the distributions .",
    "these figures clearly show that the @xmath73 distribution for spin-1 and and spin-0 resonances are quite different and they can be used to quantify the required integrated luminosity needed to discriminate between them at a given cl . a simple @xmath74 analysis of the distributions shown in fig .  [ fig : barr ] yields a 99% cl discrimination between spin-0 and spin-1 resonances of mass 500 ( 700 ) gev for an integrated luminosity of 170 ( 215 ) fb@xmath0 , considering only the statistical errors .",
    "in order to eliminate possible normalization systematics in the angular distributions , we have also estimated the integrated luminosity needed to decipher the spin of the new charged state by constructing an angular asymmetry @xmath75 considering only the statistical errors , this asymmetry allows a @xmath76% cl distinction between spin-0 and spin-1 resonances of mass 500 ( 700 ) gev for an integrated luminosity of 440 ( 560 ) fb@xmath0 . with these choices of integrated luminosities , we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 , for @xmath79 gev , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 , for @xmath82 gev , where we have quoted only the statistical errors .",
    "we also studied the resolving power of the reconstructed @xmath16 polar angle ( @xmath83 ) distribution evaluated in the @xmath30 center  of  mass frame .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : wz ] the @xmath84 distribution for spin-1 charged states after cuts ( [ cuts1])([cuts3 ] ) . since the reconstructed neutrino momentum has a twofold ambiguity , there is also a twofold ambiguity in the reconstructed @xmath16 polar angle in the @xmath30 center  of  mass frame which lead to the two distributions shown in the figure .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) lines correspond to the reconstructed @xmath16 polar angle distribution using the neutrino momentum that leads to the maximum ( minimum ) @xmath30 invariant mass .",
    "as we can see , the two distributions differ appreciably for @xmath84 close to zero",
    ". however , as shown in the figure , the average of the two distributions has a better behavior in the central region of the detector and resembles the true distribution .",
    "consequently , we have considered the average of the two reconstructed distributions as discriminating observable .",
    "[ fig : coswz ] depicts such averaged distributions for charged vector and scalar resonances , where we are included the sm background prediction for assessment of its impact on the spin determination .",
    "clearly , the production of @xmath6 leads to more @xmath30 pairs produced at small polar angles while the scalar resonance leads to more central events , as expected .",
    "as above , in order to quantify the discriminating power between the scalar and vector productions we constructed the asymmetry @xmath85 we find that for the new state mass of 500 ( 700 ) gev , it is necessary 400 ( 550 ) fb@xmath0 to separate the two possibilities at 99% cl . with these choices of integrated luminosities",
    ", we have @xmath86 and @xmath87 , for @xmath79 gev , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 , for @xmath82 gev , where we have again quoted only the statistical errors .",
    "furthermore the use of a @xmath74 analysis of the @xmath84 distribution is able to reveal the spin of the new state at 99% cl for an integrated luminosity of 150 ( 220 ) fb@xmath0 , for @xmath90 ( 700 ) gev .",
    "the observation of new charged vector resonances in higgsless models decaying into @xmath30 pairs can be carried out via weak boson production at the lhc and their subsequent decays into charged leptons  @xcite . here",
    "we show how the lhc will be able to determine the spin of these new states using two different methodologies . in the first method , only the observed charged leptons are used to discriminate between spin-0 and spin-1 resonances using the variable defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : barr ] ) . in this case , an integrated luminosity of 170 ( 215 ) fb@xmath0 is needed to establish the spin of the 500 ( 700 ) gev resonance at 99% cl via a @xmath74 analysis of the @xmath72 distribution . on the other hand , the use of the asymmetry given by eq .",
    "( [ asym : emu ] ) requires 440 ( 560 ) fb@xmath0 to determine the new resonance spin for a mass 500 ( 700 ) gev .",
    "the second method is based on the two  folded reconstruction of the escaping neutrino momentum to obtain the @xmath30 polar angle distribution in its center  of  mass frame .",
    "this procedure requires a good understanding and calibration of the hadronic calorimeters , therefore , being subject to larger systematic uncertainties .",
    "we determined that the later method can distinguish between spin-1 and spin-0 states at 99% cl for integrated luminosities of 150 ( 220 ) fb@xmath0 for @xmath79 ( 700 ) gev , respectively , when we perform a @xmath74 fit of the @xmath84 distribution .",
    "if we use the asymmetry defined in eq .",
    "( [ asym : wz ] ) to perform the analysis , the integrated luminosities are 400 and 550 fb@xmath0 , respectively . all results above only account for statistical errors and the inclusion of systematic uncertainties may render the efficiencies of the two methods rather similar .",
