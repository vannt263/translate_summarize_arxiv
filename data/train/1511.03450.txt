    "the optical spectrum of iras22272 + 5435 is more complicated than is generally seen in stars of approximately solar temperature .",
    "a number of lines of heavy elements from weak transitions are visible which are due to the strong enhancement of neutron - capture elements , and these s - process lines are significantly blended with the lines of another species throughout the spectrum .",
    "in addition , a numerous weak and sharp @xmath1 and cn lines are present in the spectrum originated probably in the agb shell . moreover , broader in comparison with the shell lines and variable features of carbon bearing molecules are visible in some of the observed spectra ( see figures  [ c2_5635_5 ] and  [ cn_51_5 ] ) .",
    "we inspected a number of lines from the blue to near - infrared wavelength region and concluded that most of the absorption features are variable in a timescale of a month to a few years . a smaller number of spectral features seem to be variable in a timescale of a week .",
    "a correlation of the intensity of the @xmath1 bandheads with the phase of the light variation is clearly visible in the spectra - the swan system bandheads are weak near light maximums ( e.g. on september 2010 and february 2008 ) and strong near light minimums ( e.g. on november 2011 and october 2006 ) .",
    "a shift of wavelengths is clearly seen for the @xmath1 bandheads relative to the photospheric radial velocity , the later of which was measured on the basis of weak and symmetrical atomic lines .",
    "the intensity variation of cn red system lines in general follows the intensity variation of @xmath1 swan system lines ( see figure  [ cn_51_5 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the cn ( 5,1 ) red system lines seem display weak emission near the observed light maximums .",
    "the profiles of strong atomic lines are broad and split into two or three components that are partly resolved at this resolution ( figure  [ split ] ) .",
    "comparison of seven spectra observed during the set of observations on september 2010 revealed only minor spectroscopic variability , which is seen only in some strong lines ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "therefore , we combined these spectra , observed in a time span of 12 days , with the goal of increasing the s / n ratio ( especially in blue wavelength region ) .",

    "5435 is at its light maximum on september 2010 and at its light minimum on november 2011 .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the spectroscopic variability was performed using the combined spectra observed at these two light extrema .",
    "the value of effective temperature for the central star of iras22272 + 5435 was determined from the constraint that the relation between iron abundances ( from individual lines ) and the excitation potential have a zero slope , resulting in @xmath12 = 5600 @xmath13 250  k @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using the same method , obtained a similar value within the uncertainty of @xmath12 = 5750  k. the best - fit model of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for iras22272 + 5435 gives @xmath14 5800  k for the central star @xcite .",
    "the interstellar extinction was found to be @xmath15 = 2.5 mag for this best - fit model , which is larger than the observed value along the line of sight towards iras22272 + 5435 for the adopted distance of 1.6 kpc @xcite .",
    "the determination of the effective temperature on the basis of color indices entails many complicated problems for the post - agb stars .",
    "chemical peculiarity and the presence of dust are responsible for the continuum depression in the blue and excess in the infrared wavelength regions , both affecting the observed colors .",
    "the central star of iras22272 + 5435 is a pulsating star with time - varying color indices .",
    "this pulsation leads to temperature variation in the photosphere of the star where most of the absorption lines are formed .",
    "thus these changes of @xmath12 during the pulsation cycle should contribute to the observed spectroscopic variability .",
    "a crude estimation of the temperature variation for the central star was performed using the color index @xmath16 , which is less affected by the continuum anomalies than is @xmath17 .",
    "a maximal variation of the color temperature was estimated using the @xmath16 observed at the light maximum on september 2010 and that at the light minimum on november 2011 , when two sets of high - resolution spectroscopic observations were gathered . assuming a color temperature relationship for iras22272 + 5435 similar to that for a typical supergiant , the color variation of @xmath18 0.12 mag translates into the temperature variation of about 500  k for the star with @xmath12 = 5750  k @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind the published values of effective temperature for iras22272 + 5435 and the probable temperature variation in the atmosphere due to pulsation , two final temperatures were adopted for the modeling of spectrum for the central star , @xmath19 = 5750 and 5250  @xmath20 ( the hotter and cooler atmospheric models , respectively ) .",
    "the surface gravity was adopted to be @xmath21 = 0.5 ( cgs ) for the final models , which is a typical value for the cool post - agb stars @xcite and agrees well with the gravity determined for iras22272 + 5435 using a ionization balance for iron . in addition",

    "weak and narrow @xmath1 swan system ( 0,0 ) and cn red system ( 2,0 ) lines identified in the spectra at the light maximum on september 2010 are blueshifted by @xmath38.3  km s@xmath23 relative to the systemic velocity , and are attributed to formation in the agb shell with the expansion velocity in range between 7.5 to 9.0  km s@xmath23 estimated using co emission lines by @xcite .",
    "the site of formation of the @xmath1 ( 0,0 ) band head at light maximum , which is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity by about 17  km s@xmath23 , is uncertain .",
    "the @xmath1 swan system band heads and lines of the system ( 0,1 ) are extremely strong and blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity in the spectra observed at light minimum .",
    "the spectrum calculated with the atmospheric model for effective temperature suitable for the central star of iras22272 + 5435 at the light minimum ( @xmath19 = 5250  @xmath20 ) , when the star is the coolest , has not reproduced the intensity of the band heads  a lower effective temperature is needed .",
    "a blueshift measured using less blended @xmath1 lines was found to be @xmath41rv",
    "= 7.0  km s@xmath23 relative to the systemic velocity , which is slightly lower in comparison with that measured at the light maximum ; however , agrees still within uncertainty with the expansion velocity of the agb shell .",
    "notice that the expansion velocity of the agb remnant estimated using a number of @xmath1 and cn absorption lines by @xcite and @xcite ranges between 6.5 to 11.4  km s@xmath23 relative to the the systemic velocity accepted in this paper , @xmath7 = -40.8  @xmath2 .",
    "notice , too , that @xcite introduced two circumstellar expanding structures for their iras22272 + 5435 model with the expansion velocities of 7.5 and 10.5  @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "thus , the strong @xmath1 lines observed at light minimum could be attributed to formation in the agb ejecta according to the measured blueshift .",
    "however , the observed intensity variation in time and phase dependence reject to attribute them to formation in the agb shell which is located at the distance of about @xmath50 cm from the star @xcite .",
    "we concluded instead that the strong @xmath1 features observed at light minimum were formed in a cool outflow triggered by pulsation .",
    "for the measured cn lines our conclusion is similar .",
    "the cn red system lines at light minimum are strong and the spectra calculated with the cool atmospheric model ( @xmath19 = 5250  @xmath20 ) and with the extra cool model ( @xmath19 = 4750  @xmath20 ) have not reproduced the intensity of the observed lines .",
    "in addition , the observed cn lines are more narrow than would be expected in the atmosphere of the star and they are blueshifted .",
    "the blueshift value for the cn lines is the same within uncertainties at both the light minimum and at the light maximum .",
    "the strong and blueshifted cn lines are apparently formed near the star , e.g. in the cool outflow , with an expansion velocity similar to that measured for the agb ejecta of iras22272 + 5435 . thus the molecular lines which are formed in the pulsationally - triggered cool outflow and those formed in the agb shell are overlapping .",
    "spectra of higher resolution are needed to confirm such an interpretation .",

    "<S> a time series of high - resolution spectra was observed in the optical wavelength region for the bright proto - planetary nebula iras22272 + 5435 ( hd235858 ) , along with a simultaneous monitoring of its radial velocity and @xmath0 magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the object is known to vary in light , color , and velocity due to pulsation with a period of 132 days . </S>",
    "<S> the light and color variations are accompanied by significant changes in spectral features , most of which are identified as lines of carbon - bearing molecules . according to the observations , the @xmath1 swan system and cn red system lines are stronger near the light minimum . </S>",
    "<S> a photospheric spectrum of the central star was calculated using new self - consistent atmospheric models . </S>",
    "<S> the observed intensity variations in the @xmath1 swan system and cn red system lines were found to be much larger than expected if due solely to the temperature variation in the atmosphere of the pulsating star . </S>",

    "<S> the site of formation of the strong molecular features appears to be a cool outflow triggered by the pulsation . </S>",
    "<S> the variability in atomic lines seems to be mostly due variations of the effective temperature during the pulsation cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles of strong atomic lines are split , and some of them are variable in a time scale of a week or so , probably because of shock waves in the outer atmosphere . </S>"
