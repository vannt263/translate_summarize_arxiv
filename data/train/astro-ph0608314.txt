    "it has been believed for over forty years that oscillatory motions play an important role in the outer solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true of the wide variety of perturbations that are possible within the chromosphere , as this is the atmospheric layer which spans the transition from the domination of gas pressure to that of the magnetic field",
    ". these oscillations may be the signature of wave energy carried outward from the photosphere and deposited in the chromosphere , hence resulting in heating of the outer atmosphere . as such , spatial variations in oscillatory behaviour",
    "could yield information on the local topology of the magnetic environment ( , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that hydrodynamic , high ",
    "frequency waves in the range @xmath0  mhz do not contribute sufficient energy to heat the atmosphere in a region of weak magnetic field . also , @xcite found that electric currents in the chromosphere above a sunspot do not show a substantial spatial correlation with regions of either high temperature or large temperature gradient .",
    "hence , it appears entirely plausible that differing forms of magnetoacoustic waves could supply some portion of the excess energy input through their existence in both extremes of the chromospheric environment .",
    "previous work on chromospheric oscillatory behaviour has reported on differences between spatial regions such as `` cell boundary '' and `` cell interior '' ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the ( equally as ambiguously defined ) magnetic `` network '' and non  magnetic `` internetwork '' ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the findings of these authors are generally discussed in relation to the magnetic environment , spatial distinctions were often not based upon any magnetic field measurements , but instead on the magnitude of time  averaged emission within some spectral line or passband .",
    "this arbitrary form of classification may give the false impression that some sharp transition occurs when moving from the weak  field regime to that of higher field strengths .",
    "in reality , the observed distribution of solar magnetism shows a continuous variation of field strengths @xcite , suggesting that forms of oscillatory behaviour which are ( in any manner ) magnetically related should vary continuously as well @xcite .    the comparison of chromospheric oscillations to surfaces of constant plasma@xmath1 , as determined by potential",
    " field extrapolations from photospheric longitudinal magnetic fields @xcite has shown the spatial distribution of oscillatory power and propagation characteristics .",
    "we note that @xmath1 , the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure , is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the sound speed ( = @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 is the ratio of specific heats ( = @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the gas pressure , @xmath8 is the mass density , @xmath9 is the alfvn speed ( = @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "however , the above studies mainly report upon the co  spatiality of oscillation behaviour with a chosen plasma@xmath1 level ( usually the unity surface ; @xmath12 ) without yielding qualitative diagnostic feedback on the local atmospheric environment .",
    "in addition , the complicated two  dimensional characteristics of chromospheric wave propagation , both hydrodynamic @xcite and magnetoacoustic @xcite in nature , are only now beginning to be successfully explored through careful modeling .",
    "the results of such work are decidedly sobering , indicating a veritable plethora of interacting wave modes propagating at different speeds , sometimes in differing directions .",
    "another consideration apparent from the simulations is the importance of knowing the plasma environment ( , gas or magnetic domination ) in which the waves exist .",

    "magnetic field data were obtained by the michelson doppler interferometer (; * ? ? ?",

    "these data consist of longitudinal magnetic field measurements recorded with a spatial sampling of 0.6  arcsec  pixel@xmath23 , as  was operating in high  resolution mode .",
    "the  magnetograms were processed to level1.8 by the standard data pipeline and compensated for the roll angle of the   spacecraft as well as the difference in image scales due to the differing observing positions of the satellites . in the case of set 2 , magnetograms were co  aligned in the same manner as the uv datacubes before taking the temporal mean . finally ,  pixels corresponding to the time  rotated   field  of  view ( fov ) were re  sampled to the  pixel size .",
    "the correlation of the co  spatial portions of the two data sets is shown by the contours in figure  [ fig : context ] .",
    "this form of to  alignment was verified by spatially cross correlating the magnetic field magnitude to the intensity of the  1700    mid  image , achieving sub  pixel accuracy .",

    "@xcite have shown , through direct comparison to the more reliable spectropolarimetry of the advanced stokes polarimeter ( ) , that  systematically underestimates the true longitudinal flux when operated in full  disk mode .",
    "however , we choose to report raw  values because our work makes use of  data obtained in high  resolution mode and the berger & lites correction factors may not be accurate  the difference in pixel sampling , and thus spatial flux averaging , should affect the slope of the  flux  flux relation .",
    "a magnetic field binning scheme was used in order to study oscillatory parameters in the  uv data as a function of the absolute  magnetic field .",
    "initially intervals of equal size were used , but the number of pixels decreases rapidly with increasing field strength . to counteract this , pixels with field strength values above @xmath24  g were instead separated into bins of systematically increasing size ( listed in the first column of table  [ tab : all_g_per ] ) . the lower limit to the  magnetic field strength intervals",
    "is directly based on the instrumental noise level being reported as @xmath25@xmath24  g @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of pixels used in our work is illustrated for the case of set 1 in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : pixel_dists ] , while the lower panel depicts the percentage of pixels that contain wavelet oscillation detections .",
    "one of the most prevalent tools that has been recently used in observational studies of oscillatory behaviour is the technique of wavelet analysis ( see the excellent introduction provided by torrence & compo 1998 and its application to solar data in , , de moortel et al .",
    "2000 , mcateer et al .",
    "2004 , and mcintosh & smilie 2004 ) .",
    "this multiscale analysis is better suited than fourier analysis to both the spatial and temporal non  stationarity exhibited by oscillations in the solar atmosphere . for our study of oscillatory signals we chose the standard morlet wavelet , a gaussian  modulated sine wave which has an associated fourier period , @xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the wavelet scale .",
    "the wavelet transform is a convolution of the time series with the analyzing wavelet function whereby the complete wavelet transform is achieved by varying the wavelet scale , which controls both the period and temporal extent of the function , and scanning this through the time series .",
    "regions exist at the beginning and end of the wavelet transform where spurious power may arise as a result of the finite extent of the time series .",
    "these regions are referred to as the cone of influence ( coi ) , having a temporal extent equal to the @xmath28folding time of the wavelet function . for the case of the morlet wavelet it has the form , @xmath29 .",
    "this time scale is effectively the response of the wavelet function to noise spikes and is used in our detection criteria by requiring that oscillations have a duration greater than @xmath30 outside the coi .",
    "this imposes a maximum period above which we can not accept detections , since we are dealing with finite time series of duration @xmath31 . at this maximum period",
    "it follows that @xmath32  for set 1 @xmath31 is 2032  s and @xmath33 is 493  s , while @xmath31 is 7060  s and @xmath33 is 1714  s for set 2 .",
    "the form of automated wavelet analysis carried out on these data has previously been presented in @xcite , although some revisions have been carried out for our work .",
    "firstly , no filtering was applied to data set 1 because the duration of observation presented here ( 34  min ) is small compared to that of the  spacecraft orbital period ( @xmath25@xmath34  min ) .",
    "therefore , long  period variations due to changes in earth upper  atmospheric transmission are of small amplitude when compared to shorter periods of solar origin .",
    "secondly , the more stringent statistical criterion of oscillations being at least 99% confident is employed rather than previous values of 95% . finally , all power in the transform is retained , even that in the coi . any detection having power above the 99% level for at least @xmath30 outside the coi has the entire duration recorded , including any portion which falls in the coi .",
    "this modification helps somewhat to circumvent previous limits on durations of detections .",
    "not only does the upper limit to the possible number of cycles decrease with increasing oscillatory period ( since analyzing finite duration time series ) , but removing the coi decreases this upper limit more drastically as the coi both increases with period and occurs at the start and end of the wavelet transform . after a complete analysis , carried out on the time series of each spatial pixel in all three  passbands , the output comprises the duration in oscillatory cycles and the period of every detection .",
    "a fourier phase difference analysis was used to further study possible propagation characteristics of waves between the co  spatial 1700    and 1600    time series .",
    "these passbands were chosen based on the proximity of their peak formation heights @xcite .",
    "this form of fourier analysis is a technique which allows investigation of the difference in waveforms between two time series . using the phase information contained within the complex fourier transform , via the equations discussed in detail by @xcite , the difference in cyclic phase , @xmath35 , can be determined for each fourier frequency component , @xmath36 , with the quality of the values represented by the phase coherence .",
    "the pairs of 1700    and 1600    time series in this study are extracted from the same ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) pixel location , but the signals remain separated in the direction normal to the solar surface . in this scenario ,",
    "phase differences can be interpreted as delays caused by the finite propagation speed of waves traveling between the formation heights .",
    "the 1700    data were linearly interpolated to the 1600     ( equally  separated ) times to compensate for timing offsets that result from the  uv data acquisition (   [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "these offsets require removal as they produce drifts in phase difference spectra with frequency @xcite .    at those frequencies over which a wave has a real solution to its dispersion relation , and may thus propagate ,",
    "phase difference spectra between emission signals formed at two separate heights are expected to have the form , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the separation distance of the emitting regions , @xmath41 is the phase speed of the wave , and @xmath36 is the oscillation frequency . in a method similar to @xcite , phase difference gradients ( @xmath42 ) were extracted over the frequency range @xmath43  mhz ( periods @xmath44  s ) .",
    "this range was chosen because it encompasses the majority of our oscillation detections (   [ subsec : per_bmdi ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : fft_exam ] , phase difference gradients were achieved by applying a weighted least  squares fit of a first ",
    "order polynomial to the phase difference spectra obtained from all time series originating from pixels in a particular range of field strengths .",
    "the contribution of each phase difference point to the fit was weighted by both the fourier cross  power and coherence values .",
    "wavelet results are presented only for set 1 to avoid repetition , since set 2 displays similar behaviour with longer ",
    "period detections due to the increased duration of observation and more short  period detections from flare surges in the time series .",
    "however , fourier results from both data sets are provided and discussed .",
    "detections in each  field strength interval were sampled in terms of their period with uniform @xmath45  s binning .",
    "the resulting 1700   , 1600   , and 1550    pdfs are shown in figure  [ fig : perbmagall ] , where the individual distributions are self ",
    "normalized to their peak number of detections to highlight changes between pdfs by compensating for the decreased number statistics at increased field strengths ( figure  [ fig : pixel_dists ] ) .",
    "fitting profiles which consisted of a single gaussian and a linearly increasing first  order polynomial ( as most distributions showed a tail of detections at high periods ) were applied to each pdf .",
    "although the distributions are not ideally gaussian , the variation of fitted centroid period ( @xmath46 ; displayed as central bar marks in figure  [ fig : perbmagall ] and detailed in table  [ tab : all_g_per ] ) with  field strength and uv passband formation height should at least qualitatively describe these data .",
    "bars extend over the @xmath471@xmath48 width of the gaussian fit in figure  [ fig : perbmagall ] , representing pdf spread and not error in the fit . for each uv",
    "passband the symbols are plotted at the mean absolute field strength of the pixels which show oscillations in that passband . for",
    "a particular range of  field strengths the mean value will vary between each of the three uv passbands , a direct result of the differing pixel numbers which contribute to the different uv passband oscillation distributions ( lower panel of figure  [ fig : pixel_dists ] ) .",
    "period pdfs in the range @xmath49  g shift to higher values of @xmath46 when moving to larger  field strengths .",
    "this progression of periods in the low chromosphere from 4 to 5 min agrees with the findings of @xcite who analyzed 3    wide passband observations of  k line intensity in the quiet ",
    "sun ( inter)network .",
    "although the k@xmath50 portion of the  k line profile is formed at least somewhat above the temperature minimum ( , above these  data ) , close agreement may still be expected with this work because the k@xmath51 wing emission also contained in their broad passband is formed around the temperature minimum @xcite .",
    "lawrence et al .",
    "attribute the period change to their passband being formed below the @xmath52 level at low field strengths and above it for higher fields , without offering a physical reason for the change .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that the periods detected are incompatible with standard mhd theory , where waves can only propagate at periods below the acoustic cutoff ( @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is temperature ) . as such , waves up to @xmath255  min period can propagate into the photosphere ( , @xmath55 modes ) but the temperature decrease with height in the low chromosphere acts to decrease the cutoff period and previously propagating long  period waves become evanescent .",
    "we extend the hypothesis of @xcite by proposing that wave propagation may be permitted and the period behaviour explained using both the direct dependence that @xmath56 has on the magnetic field strength @xcite and the inclination , @xmath57 , which arises through the effective gravity , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 , where @xmath60  m  s@xmath23 ; * ? ? ? * ) . as shown by @xcite , regions of increased magnetic field experience the @xmath52 level at lower altitudes .",
    "this intuitively suggests that the `` magnetic canopy '' , where the field spreads nearly horizontally , will be formed lower . if for low field strengths a hof lies significantly below the `` canopy '' level it will experience near  vertical field lines .",
    "however , as the photospheric flux increases , the @xmath52 and `` canopy '' levels will be pulled down toward the hof such that it samples increasingly inclined fields .",
    "the larger inclination acts to reduce the effective gravity , which in turn increases the cutoff period allowing for `` tunneling '' of evanescent wave modes @xcite . over the range @xmath61  g , increasing values of @xmath46 are recorded when moving upward through the uv passband hofs , agreeing with this picture of sampling field lines of increasing inclination with height .",

    "the large degree of similarity between the behaviours of these two sets of distributions strongly implies that both uv passbands are formed in essentially the same physical environment .",

    "the oscillation durations then shorten to @xmath148  cycles for nearly all higher field strengths .",
    "it appears that , if these oscillations are indeed waves , below @xmath149  g some portion of the wave energy budget has been lost between the formation heights of 1600    and 1550   , since the 1550    data exhibit durations shorter than both the 1700    and 1600    data .",
    "by contrast , the wavelet detection durations are conserved in the stronger  field range @xmath150  g which , in turn , indicates that the effective `` boundary '' previously lying between the 1600    and 1550    hofs has been lowered in altitude to below the 1700    hof . incorporating a potential  field extrapolation , @xcite interpret their change from 4 to 5 min periods at field strengths of @xmath25@xmath151  g as resulting from the lowering of the @xmath1unity surface below the formation height of their  k line emission",
    "this is very close to our wavelet duration transition field strength of @xmath152  g , while the disparity may be explained by the difference in passband formation heights and/or the assumption of the static , spatially  averaged val c model atmosphere @xcite in the extrapolation .",
    "although highly versatile and a powerful tool for studying oscillatory behaviour , the wavelet analysis performed up to now has not been able to distinguish whether the detected oscillations are the signatures of propagating waves in the solar atmosphere .",
    "it is for this reason that fourier phase difference analysis was applied to the same data .",
    "the results of the analysis , outlined in ",
    "[ subsec : fft_phdiff ] , are presented in figure  [ fig : fft_grad ] for both data sets as the weighted  fit values of phase difference gradient between the 1700    and 1600    time series pairings .",
    "if a spatially  invariant atmosphere is assumed , the vertical separation of uv hofs will not vary when moving into regions of increased magnetic field .",
    "as a result , @xmath40 is constant and equation  [ eqn : ph_grad ] informs us that a change in fourier phase difference gradient denotes the inverse of the change that has occurred in the wave phase speed . in the past , such forms of atmosphere have been used to implement potential  field extrapolations ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , these act to oversimplify the complexity of the magnetic atmosphere and the application of 1d models that take account of the differences between regions of differing magnetic field will yield more appropriate results .    from consideration of equation  [ eqn : ph_grad ] ,",
    "it is possible that the initial decrease of gradient values in figure  [ fig : fft_grad ] could result from waves having the same phase speed but the hof separations are reduced with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this suggests that @xmath153 should continue decreasing for even stronger fields , but we detect a switch in behaviour to increasing @xmath153 in the range @xmath139  g which requires increasing separations between the hofs .",
    "this change in separation behaviour does not make qualitative sense , so we proceed by assuming a spatially  invariant atmosphere that yields increasing wave phase speeds up to @xmath86  g and a subsequent decrease in speeds up to @xmath154  g. a decrease in  uv phase difference gradient with increasing magnetic field has been previously observed by @xcite with no turnaround reported .",
    "the deviation of our results can be explained by their quiet ",

    "the observed wave speed behaviour over low to moderate magnetic fields may be interpreted as resulting from a change in physical environment within our pixel sampling rather than merely a variation of magnetic field . in regions spatially removed from the large flux concentrations of sunspots and plage ,",

    "magnetoacoustic waves will propagate at @xmath3 ( since @xmath162 ) while fast modes propagate between @xmath9 and @xmath159 .",
    "if these flux concentrations satisfy certain requirements they may be thought of as `` thin flux tubes '' @xcite , in which slow modes propagate at the tube speed .",
    "values of @xmath163 are typically used for plasma@xmath1 in the modeling of flux tubes ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yielding tube speeds of @xmath25@xmath164 and fast  mode speeds between @xmath25@xmath165 and @xmath25@xmath166 . in this picture ,",
    "the lowest field strengths arise from small values of @xmath158 so the measured speed is dominated by the `` flux  external '' sound speed , while for higher field strengths the filling factor increases and the contribution from the `` flux  associated '' speeds becomes more important .",
    "eventually , a filling factor of unity is reached and the passbands are formed in an homogeneously distributed magnetic environment for greater field strengths .",
    "the change from inhomogeneous to homogeneous environments ends the `` flux tube '' supported wave scenario . when @xmath167 , the magnetic field has expanded to fill the entire pixel area , creating a `` magnetic canopy '' over the previously `` flux  external '' plasma .",
    "this marks the transition from mixed high and low @xmath1 to entirely low@xmath1 environment ( , the @xmath168 level ) and is signaled by the change in trend of phase difference gradient at fields of @xmath86  g. although kilo ",
    "gauss magnetic elements have been mentioned and field strengths of @xmath86  g are reported for filling factors of unity , field values are measured at the photosphere while @xmath158 corresponds to the region of the chromosphere where waves are detected and field lines have expanded into a greater spatial area .    inside the subsequent homogeneous low@xmath1 atmosphere , the fast  mode propagates at @xmath169 , tending to @xmath170@xmath3 when @xmath171 . the initial fast  mode speed in the homogeneous situation ( , when @xmath52 ) is expected to be at most @xmath25@xmath172 , yielding a phase difference gradient which differs from the field  free case by a factor of @xmath25@xmath173 ( within the error bars of the ratio between our values recorded at @xmath174  g and @xmath175  g ) .",
    "the slow mode is again quasi  longitudinal and propagates at @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the sound speed should not change between field strengths since it depends only on temperature ( @xmath176@xmath177 ) and the wave behaviours reported here occur between the same two uv passbands , which are formed over the same range of temperatures irrespective of magnetic field .",
    "the gradual decrease of wave speeds in the range @xmath139  g is taken as a signature of both modes existing within our signal , with the measured value of @xmath153 resulting from averaging between the two speeds .",
    "the increase of phase difference gradient with increasing magnetic field towards a similar value as detected over field strengths in the small filling factor range of @xmath175  g implies that the wave speeds are tending toward the sound speed , and slow  mode waves become dominant in our stronger field regions of plage and umbrae .",
    "an implication of slow ",
    "mode dominance in regions of stronger field is that slow modes propagate higher into the atmosphere than fast modes @xcite  the `` magnetic canopy '' occurs at lower altitudes when moving to higher field strengths , the uv passbands are formed progressively further above the @xmath1unity level , and we detect only the speeds of modes which propagate higher into the atmosphere . the disclosure of these waves as slow modes provides a direct , and necessary , link to coronal studies @xcite , where propagating intensity variations at 3 and 5 min periods are interpreted as slow ",
    "magnetoacoustic waves in loops anchored in umbrae and plage , respectively .",
    "we note a disparity between the abundance of wave signatures in the low chromosphere and the sparse detection of slow ",
    "mode associated phenomena in the transition region @xcite and corona @xcite .",
    "some mechanism is clearly required to quench most of these lower atmospheric waves with one possibility being slow  mode driven pedersen current dissipation @xcite , theorised to be highly efficient in the chromosphere .",
    "the non  uniformity observed in the upper atmosphere may highlight other selection effects at work on wave transmission , possibly based on @xmath55mode interference with complex field orientations .",
    "field inclinations affected by @xmath55modes may also help explain the temporal intermittency of waves by only providing suitable propagation conditions over short , repeating timescales .",
    "it should be noted that some penumbral pixels may be misinterpreted as weaker field regions from of the los nature of  and the existence of highly  inclined , outer  penumbral magnetic fields , , field strengths of @xmath178  g inclined 80  to the vertical @xcite will be recorded as @xmath179  g. however , pixels misclassified as such will not greatly modify the phase difference gradients , as the true weak  to  moderate field pixels ( @xmath180  g ) dominate the number statistics .",
    "instead they contribute to greater error  bar magnitudes at higher field strengths , alongside the decrease in pixel numbers .",
    "larger errors associated with gradient values above @xmath154  g may arise from averaging between the sunspot @xmath253 and 5 min distributions , if propagating at different speeds . decreased gradient values over @xmath181  g from those at fields both above and below complements this interpretation , as period pdfs exhibit widening toward and the detection of 5min penumbral oscillations over this range . hence , by causing decreased phase difference gradients , penumbral waves appear to either travel faster than those in umbrae and plage or experience a reduction in the hof separations , distinctly possible for a penumbral atmosphere stratified along field lines at inclinations of @xmath182  @xcite .",
    "chromospheric intensity variations have been studied using both time  localized wavelet and fourier analysis .",
    "investigation of the oscillation behaviours has identified three regimes with distinctly differing properties .",
    "the increase of wavelet period with  field over @xmath49  g marks the modification of the magnetoacoustic cutoff period by field inclination effects .",
    "this arises from the `` magnetic canopy '' being pulled progressively closer to the sampled hofs so that they experience more inclined fields .",
    "wavelet durations show a decrease in the 1550    data over those in the 1600    and 1700    data , indicating a loss of wave energy .",
    "this can be explained by waves undergoing mode conversion or reflection at the @xmath1unity surface @xcite .",
    "fourier analysis indicates that wave phase speeds increase with magnetic field between the 1700    and 1600     formation heights .",
    "it is proposed here that this is due to an increase in magnetic filling factor within the pixel sampling , yielding a greater contribution to the observed wave speed from the low@xmath1 `` flux  associated '' fast  mode speed over the slower sound speed of the surrounding high@xmath1 plasma .",
    "the similarity of wavelet periods and durations over field strengths in the range @xmath183  g implies that waves in this regime do not experience a drastic change in their environmental topology as evidenced by the weaker  field case .",
    "the @xmath1unity surface is believed to lie below the formation height of 1700    emission , no transitional interface exists between the passbands , and wave energy ( , wavelet duration ) is conserved with altitude .",
    "in contrast to the weak  field regime wave speeds decrease , which may be a signature of a change from dominant fast  mode magnetoacoustic waves to slow ",
    "mode waves when moving from network into plage .    wavelet period distributions broaden and display a doubly  distributed nature over @xmath184  g , marking the sampling of sunspot regions .",
    "interpretation of the 5min component as being of penumbral origin is given strong support by the virtual disappearance of these higher  period components when sampling field strengths @xmath157@xmath185  g ( , umbrae ) .",
    "the decrease of phase difference gradient values over the mixed penumbral / umbral field strength range ( @xmath184  g ) suggests that either penumbral waves travel at greater speeds than those in plage and umbral regions or the formation heights of the 1700    and 1600    passbands are closer in altitude ( , because of inclined fields ) in the penumbra .    in the future",
    ", we will be able to better determine the intricate relationship between magnetic topology and propagating waves using high  resolution , vector magnetic field information .",
    "such data will soon be obtained by the full  stokes spectropolarimeter in the instrument suite of the solar optical telescope ( ) focal plane package ( ) on board _ solar ",
    "b_. coordinated observations between this instrument , , and the multi ",
    "wavelength tunable filters also contained in the / will yield diffraction  limited , high  cadence imaging at multiple heights through the outer solar atmosphere unparalleled by previous observations . the combination of these forms of data with a range of atmospheric models taking into account the differences in atmospheric stratification for differing magnetic fields will yield a powerful diagnostic suite for studies of solar wave phenomena .",
