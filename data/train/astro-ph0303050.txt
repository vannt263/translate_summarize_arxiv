    "recently , the magnetic coupling of a rotating black hole ( bh ) with its surrounding disc has been investigated by certain authors ( blandford 1999 ; li 2000 , li 2002a , b , hereafter li02a and li02b , respectively ; li & paczynski 2000 ; wang , xiao & lei 2002 , hereafter wxl ) .",
    "this coupling can be regarded a variation of the blandford - znajek ( bz ) process , proposed two decades ago ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) . with closed magnetic field lines connecting a rotating bh with the disc , energy and angular momentum",
    "can be transferred from the bh to the disc and henceforth this energy mechanism is referred to as the magnetic coupling ( mc ) process .",
    "the load in the mc process is the surrounding disc , which is much better understood than the remote astrophysical load in the bz process .",
    "energy and angular momentum are always transferred from the bh to the unknown remote load in the bz process , while the transfer direction of energy and angular momentum in the mc process depends not only on the angular velocity of the bh but also on that of the disc where each closed field line penetrates .",
    "usually , the transfer of energy and angular momentum in the mc process is stated as follows : if a bh rotates faster than its surrounding disc , it exerts a torque on the disc and energy and angular momentum are extracted from the bh and transferred to the disc , and vice versa. however , this statement is rather vague and only applicable to the case that the closed magnetic field lines are attached to the inner edge of the disc . in a more realistic model",
    "the closed field lines are assumed to connect the bh horizon with the disc by attaching a ring with inner and outer boundary as shown in fig.1 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the radii of the inner and outer boundary of the mc region , respectively , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the corresponding angular coordinates on the bh horizon .",
    "it is shown in wxl that the width of the mc region should not be given at random , which can be determined by conservation of magnetic flux in the context of general relativity . in this paper",
    "the mapping relation derived in wxl between the angular coordinate on the bh horizon and the radial coordinate on the disc is modified by a boundary condition on the closed field lines connecting the two loops in the equatorial plane of the bh .",
    "it turns out that the transfer direction of energy and angular momentum is determined by the position of the co - rotation radius relative to the mc region , and ultimately depends on the bh spin eventually .",
    "in addition , other mc effects , such as bh entropy change , efficiency of releasing energy , disc radiation and emissivity , also appear to be related intimately to the bh spin .",
    "in particular , as argued in li02b , the mc effects on emissivity are consistent with the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "we find that a variety of mc parameters are suitable for the above observation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the basic evolution equation of a bh in mc process , and derive a modified mapping relation between the angular coordinate on the bh horizon and the radial coordinate on the disc . in section 3",
    "the evolution characteristics of a rotating bh in the mc process without disc accretion are depicted in terms of the bh spin in a parameter space , and a series of values of the bh spin are given to indicate the evolution features .",
    "the sequence of these values are related to the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the bh and the disc , and guaranteed by the second law of bh thermodynamics ( wald 1984 ) . in section 4 the efficiency of bh - disc systems in converting accreted mass into radiation energy",
    "is discussed in terms of the coexistence of disc accretion and the mc process .",
    "in addition , we discuss mc effects on disc radiation and emissivity index that are consistent with the recent _ xmm - newton _ observation of the nearby bright seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 . finally in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize our main results .    in order to facilitate the discussion of the correlation of bh spin with mc effects in an analytic way",
    ", we make the following assumptions :",
    "\\(i ) the disc is both stable and perfectly conducting , and the closed magnetic field lines are frozen in the disc .",
    "\\(ii ) the disc is thin and keplerian , and lies in the equatorial plane of the bh with the inner boundary being at the marginally stable orbit .",
    "\\(iii ) the magnetic field is assumed to be weak , and the effect of instabilities of the disc and the magnetic field are ignored ; the magnetosphere is stationary , axisymmetric and force - free outside the bh and the disc;.    \\(iv ) the magnetic field is assumed to be constant on the horizon , and to vary as a power law with the radial coordinate of the disc .    throughout this paper the geometric units @xmath4 are used .",
    "as argued by macdonald & thorne ( 1982 , hereafter mt ) , the magnetic field on the horizon is brought and held by the surrounding magnetized disc .",
    "so both disc accretion and the mc process should be taken into account in our model for bh evolution .",
    "based on conservation of energy and angular momentum , the basic equations for bh evolution with the coexistence of disc accretion and the mc process are written as    @xmath5    @xmath6    combining equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) we have the evolution of bh spin :    @xmath7    now we give a brief explanation for the quantities in equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are mass and angular momentum of the bh , respectively .",
    "@xmath10 is the dimensionless angular momentum of the bh , and referred to as the bh spin . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are specific energy and angular momentum corresponding to the inner edge of the thin disc , i.e. the last stable circular orbit , respectively ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",
    "@xmath13 is the accretion rate . at first sight ,",
    "@xmath13 will be affected by the mc process owing to angular momentum transferred between the rotating bh and the disc .",
    "we derived the mc correction on @xmath13 by considering the conservation law of angular momentum and the angular momentum transferred at the inner edge of the disc ( see appendix a in wxl ) .",
    "unfortunately , the modification to @xmath13 , equation ( [ eq41 ] ) in wxl , is incorrect , since accretion rate can not depend on radius in a stationary flow , and the validity of the following results of sections 5 and 6 in wxl is doubtful . in this paper",
    "the mc effects on the accretion rate are not considered for the following reasons .",
    "\\(i ) a constant accretion rate is required by the conservation of mass in a stationary disc .",
    "\\(ii ) from equations ( [ eq58 ] ) and ( [ eq59 ] ) we find that the viscous torque related to disc radiation can regulates itself everywhere to counteract the effects of angular momentum transferred into the disc on the accretion rate .    in the basic evolution equations",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the rates of extracting energy and angular momentum from the rotating bh by the mc process , and henceforth are referred to as the mc power and the mc torque , respectively .",
    "we have derived the expressions for @xmath14 and @xmath15 in wxl as follows :    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the angular coordinate on the horizon varying from @xmath2 to @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are defined as    @xmath22    and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are @xmath25 and @xmath8 in the units of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is defined as the ratio of the angular velocity on the thin disc to that on the horizon , and we have the following expressions :    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the radius of the horizon of a kerr bh .",
    "@xmath32 is the angular velocity of the closed field line connecting the bh and the disc , and @xmath33 arises from the freezing - in condition in the disc ( mt ) .    in order to calculate @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "we should first determine the mapping relation between the bh horizon and the disc .",
    "considering the flux tube consisting of two adjacent magnetic surfaces `` @xmath34 '' and `` @xmath35 '' as shown in fig.1 , we have @xmath36 required by continuum of magnetic flux , i.e.    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the normal components of magnetic field at the horizon and the disc , respectively , and    @xmath40    @xmath41    where    @xmath42    in equation ( [ eq12 ] ) @xmath43is a dimensionless radial parameter defined in terms of the radius @xmath44 of the last stable circular orbit . following blandford ( 1976 ) we assume that @xmath39 varies as    @xmath45    * table 1 . _ some quantities related to @xmath46 _ *    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab6 ]    inspecting fig.6",
    ", we have the following results on the transfer of angular momentum :    \\(i ) the value of @xmath47 is negative for very low bh spin as shown in fig.6(a ) , and its value is positive for a very high bh spin as shown in fig.6(c ) .",
    "\\(ii ) as shown in fig.6(b ) , positive @xmath48 coexists with negative @xmath49 for bh spin , such as @xmath50 , which is consistent with the value for the coexistence of the omcr and the imcr as shown in table 3 .",
    "\\(iii ) as shown in fig.6b and 6c , the flux of angular momentum transferred decreases as @xmath51 approaches @xmath52 .    by using equations ( [ eq50 ] ) , ( [ eq51 ] ) and ( [ eq56 ] ) we have the curves of @xmath53 and @xmath54 versus @xmath55 as shown in fig.7 , where @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57",
    "combining equations ( [ eq51 ] ) , ( [ eq52 ] ) and ( [ eq56 ] ) , we have the curves of the emissivity index @xmath58 versus @xmath59 as shown in fig.8 .    from fig.7",
    "we find that @xmath60 varies much more steeply with @xmath61 than @xmath62 does .",
    "it is found in fig.8 that we can adapt the emissivity index arising from @xmath63 to the observations of the observations by the curves in the shaded region , while the index of a standard accretion disc ( sad ) is far below the shaded region .",
    "this result is one of the observational signatures of the magnetic coupling between a rotating bh and its surrounding disc .",
    "compared with the model given in li02b we have more parameters to choose for adapting the emissivity index to the observations . considering both the mapping relation ( [ eq19 ] ) and the observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15",
    ", we have the values of the power - law index @xmath64 corresponding to the different values of @xmath2 and @xmath65 as shown in table 6 .    from table 6",
    "we find that the values of @xmath64 adapted to the observations are generally less than those given in li02b , if @xmath2 is not close to @xmath19 .",
    "this result implies that the concentration of the magnetic field on the disc could be relaxed in our model .",
    "it has been proved in pt74 that the internal viscous torque per unit circumference @xmath66 is related to the radiation flux @xmath67 by    @xmath68     versus @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 in dotted , dashed and dot - dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the emissivity index of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6 - 30 - 15 inferred from the observation of _ xmm - newton _ is shown by the shaded region .",
    "the emissivity index of a standard accretion disc ( sad ) is plotted in solid line .",
    "( upper panel ) @xmath73 , ( lower panel ) @xmath74.,width=207 ]    ( a )     versus @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 in dotted , dashed and dot - dashed lines , respectively .",

    "( upper panel ) @xmath73 , ( lower panel ) @xmath74.,width=207 ]    ( b )    equation ( [ eq58 ] ) was derived based on the three laws of conservation , and it is proved to be valid for the mc process in li02a . combining equations ( [ eq49 ] ) and ( [ eq58 ] ) , we can express the contribution to @xmath66 as follows :    @xmath75         \\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the contribution due to disc accretion and the mc process , and are related to @xmath78 and @xmath79 by equation ( [ eq58 ] ) , respectively . since the flux of angular momentum transferred away from the disc by radiation ( henceforth famfd ) is @xmath80 , and that transferred from the bh into the disc by the magnetic field ( henceforth famfh ) is @xmath81 , the ratio of the two can be expressed as    @xmath82    from equations ( [ eq60 ] ) we obtain the curves of @xmath83 versus @xmath51 for the given values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 as shown in fig.9 .    combining figs.6 and 9 , we obtain the following relations between famfd and famfh :    ( i)as shown in fig.9(a ) , we have @xmath84 , which means that the absolute value of famfd is less than that of famfh , i.e. @xmath85 , for a bh with low spin such as @xmath86 .",
    "( ii)as shown in fig.9(b ) , we have @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and @xmath83 approaches infinity at the place where @xmath81 changes its sign .",
    "so we infer that @xmath89 holds in the whole mc region @xmath90 by considering the sign of @xmath81 in fig.6(b ) .",
    "( iii)as shown in fig.9(c ) , we have @xmath84 for @xmath91 , where famfd is dominated by famfh .",
    "and we have @xmath92 for @xmath93 , where famfd dominates over famfh .",
    "it is easy to obtain that the radial coordinate @xmath94 indicating @xmath95 is equal to 1.498 , 1.552 and 1.857 for @xmath961.1 , 1.5 and 3.0 , respectively .    from the above discussion",
    "we find that both famfd and famfh are related intimately not only to the bh spin but also to the disc location .",
    "in this paper the transfer of energy and angular momentum between a rotating bh and its surrounding accretion disc is discussed in detail by considering mc effects .",
    "our discussion is given for two cases : ( i)the mc process without disc accretion , ( ii)the mc process with disc accretion .",
    "in the first case only the two conservation laws of energy and angular momentum are used , while in the second case the conservation of accreted mass is used in addition .",
    "compared with li02a and li02b , the mapping relation ( [ eq19 ] ) is used to depict the mc process throughout this paper , and the correlation of some parameters with mc effects is discussed , where the bh spin @xmath65 , the power - law index @xmath64 and the radial coordinate @xmath51 are involved .    compared with the bz process we find that the mc effects do not increase monotonically as the bh spin .",
    "for example , in figs . 4 and 5 both @xmath97 and @xmath98 attain their maxima and then decrease very rapidly as @xmath65 approaches unity .",
    "these results can be explained by the equations ( [ eq39 ] ) and ( [ eq48 ] ) with the behavior of @xmath52 as @xmath65 approaches unity . from fig.2",
    "we find that the outer radius of mc region approaches the inner edge of the disc very closely as @xmath65 approaches unity , and accordingly the ratio @xmath99 approaches unity along as @xmath44 approaches the horizon radius @xmath31 .",
