    "close binary star systems ( separation comparable to the stellar radii ) are often accompanied by a third star .",
    "such triple - star systems may be stable for long times if the system is hierarchical , that is , if the system consists of an `` inner '' binary ( masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) in a nearly keplerian orbit with semi - major axis @xmath9 , and an `` outer '' binary in which @xmath10 orbits the center of mass of the inner binary , with semi - major axis @xmath11 .",
    "if the formation of the inner binary is independent of the formation of the outer binary , then the probability that a close binary has a distant companion should be the same as the probability that an individual star has a companion in such an orbit .",
    "it is well known that the latter probability is substantial , about @xmath12 for nearby systems whose brightest component is a g - dwarf @xcite .",
    "recent studies suggest that a similarly large fraction of contact binaries have a third component @xcite .",
    "the data show , however , that characteristics of the inner and outer binary in hierarchical triples are _ not _ independent : the probability of having a third component turns out to be a function of the period of the inner binary .",
    "@xcite found that 96% of a sample of spectroscopic binaries with periods less than @xmath3  d had a tertiary component , compared to only 34% of binaries with periods greater than @xmath13  d. this sample was not carefully selected to control biases , however such biases are unlikely to change the basic result , since the authors observe that _ all _ of the five binaries with period less than @xmath4  d in the volume - limited sample of @xcite have at least one additional companion .",
    "a closely related observation is that the period distribution of inner binaries in triple systems is quite different from the period distribution of isolated binaries .",
    "@xcite found a significant peak at about @xmath3  d in the logarithmic period distribution of inner binaries of triple systems , a peak that is not present in isolated binaries .",
    "because of this feature , the period distributions for binaries with and without a third component are different with a significance of 0.999 @xcite .",
    "the period distribution from time domain surveys of eclipsing binaries also peaks at a few days @xcite , but it remains unclear whether this may be attributed to a selection effect : binaries with large orbital periods have a lower probability of eclipsing and fewer eclipses per unit time which diminishes the signal @xcite .",
    "these observational results are surprising . in particular , the median semi - major axis of the outer binary in systems with inner binary period @xmath14  d ( @xmath15  au ) is @xmath16  au @xcite , similar to the median for all binaries in the @xcite sample . why are the processes of star formation correlated over a range of three orders of magnitude in scale ? in this paper we explore the possibility that in some circumstances the distant companion enhances tidal interactions in the inner binary , causing its period to shrink to the currently observed value .",
    "the study of the long - term behavior of three point masses interacting only through gravity has engaged physicists and mathematicians since the time of newton . in most cases",
    ", long - term stability requires that the system is hierarchical ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "an additional requirement for a stable hierarchical triple system is that the eccentricity @xmath18 of the outer binary can not be too large , so that @xmath10 can not make close approaches to @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "an equivalent statement is that the gravitational perturbations from @xmath10 on the inner binary must always be weak .",
    "however , even weak perturbations from the outer body can have important long - term effects on the inner binary .",
    "the simplest of these is precession of the orbital plane , which occurs if the orbital planes of the inner and outer binary are not aligned .",
    "if the inner and outer binary orbits are circular , this precession is analogous to the precession of two rigid rings with the same mass , radius , and angular momentum as the binary orbits : both the mutual inclination and the scalar angular momenta of the rings remain fixed , while the two angular - momentum vectors precess around the direction defined by the total angular - momentum vector of the triple system .",
    "an unexpected aspect of this behavior was discovered by @xcite .",
    "suppose the inner binary orbit is initially circular , with the initial mutual inclination between inner and outer binaries equal to @xmath19 .",
    "kozai found that there is a critical angle @xmath20 such that if @xmath19 is between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then the orbit of the inner binary can not remain circular as it precesses : both the eccentricity of the inner binary @xmath22 and the mutual inclination @xmath23 execute periodic oscillations known as kozai cycles .",
    "the amplitude of the eccentricity and inclination oscillations is independent of the strength of the perturbation from the outer body , which depends on @xmath10 , @xmath24 , and @xmath18 , but the oscillation amplitude does depend on @xmath19 : for initial circular orbits with @xmath25 or @xmath21 , the maximum eccentricity is @xmath26 , but if @xmath27 the maximum eccentricity is unity ; i.e. , the two inner bodies collide .",
    "kozai cycles can be investigated analytically by averaging over the orbital phases of the inner and outer binaries @xcite ; this averaging , usually called the secular approximation , is justified because the precession time is generally much longer than the orbital time of either binary . in the averaged problem",
    "the semi - major axes of the inner and outer binary are both conserved .",
    "the analysis is simplest in the limiting case when @xmath11 ( so that the perturbing potential of the outer body can be written in the quadrupole approximation ) and the angular momentum of the outer binary is much greater than that of the inner binary ( so that the orientation of the outer binary is a constant of the motion ) . with these approximations ,",
    "the following results hold .",
    "( i ) the averaged quadrupole potential from the outer binary is axisymmetric relative to its orbital plane .",
    "( ii ) the averaged problem can be described by a hamiltonian with one degree of freedom .",
    "( iii ) the eccentricity of the outer binary is constant .",
    "( iv ) the critical inclination is @xmath28 .",
    "( v ) if the inner orbit is initially circular the maximum eccentricity achieved in a kozai cycle is @xmath29^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "( vi ) depending on the initial conditions , the argument of pericenter @xmath30 ( the angle measured in the orbital plane between the pericenter of the inner binary and the orbital plane of the outer binary ) can either librate ( oscillate around @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) or circulate .",
    "the system may remain at a fixed point with @xmath33 or @xmath32 and @xmath34^{1/2}$ ] if @xmath35 .",
    "( vii ) the only property of the kozai oscillation that depends on the masses of the three bodies , their semi - major axes , or the eccentricity of the outer binary is the period of the oscillation , which is of order the timescale @xcite : @xmath36 small - amplitude libration about the fixed point takes place with a period @xmath37 ( viii ) octupole and higher - order terms in the perturbing potential introduce a narrow chaotic zone around the separatrix between circulating and librating solutions as determined by the quadrupole approximation @xcite .    consider a sequence of triple systems in which the semi - major axis @xmath24 of the outer binary becomes larger and larger , while its mass , inclination , and eccentricity remain the same .",
    "the maximum eccentricity of the inner binary in the kozai cycle will remain fixed , but the period of the kozai cycle will grow as @xmath38",
    ". this behavior will continue so long as the perturbation from the outer body is the dominant cause of apsidal precession in the inner binary orbit .",
    "thus , weak perturbations from distant third bodies can induce large eccentricity and inclination oscillations .",
    "however , small additional sources of apsidal precession in the inner binary  general relativity , tides , the quadrupole moments of the two members of the inner binary , planetary companions , etc.can completely suppress kozai oscillations caused by a distant third body if they dominate the apsidal precession .",
    "the dissipative forces due to tides on the stars of the inner binary are only significant if the two stars are separated by less than a few stellar radii .",
    "thus the tidal friction on an inner binary with a semi - major axis of ( say ) @xmath39  au , corresponding to an orbital period of @xmath40  d if @xmath41 , is normally negligible .",
    "however , if the amplitude of the eccentricity oscillation during a kozai cycle is sufficiently large , the pericenter distance of the inner binary may become sufficiently small at some phase of the cycle that tidal friction drains energy from the orbit , reducing the semi - major axis and thereby enhancing the friction , until the inner binary settles into a circular orbit with a semi - major axis of only a few stellar radii .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to this process as kozai cycles with tidal friction ( kctf ) .",
    "@xcite first suggested that kctf might be an important evolutionary mechanism for triple stars .",
    "@xcite showed how the long - period perturbations of a third body could reduce the inner binary s separation on the tidal dissipation timescale .",
    "@xcite used kctf to constrain the strength of tidal dissipation in stars and focused on the possibility that the inner binary of the algol system might have shrunk significantly by this mechanism .",
    "@xcite presented the differential equations that we use here to model kctf , which parametrize the extra forces ( tidal friction , quadrupole from a distant companion , etc . ) acting on a binary orbit .",
    "kozai cycles have also been studied in the planetary context .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all suggested that the large eccentricities observed in many extrasolar planet orbits could be explained by kozai cycles if the host star were a member of a binary system ; however , this hypothesis leads to two predictions that are not verified @xcite : ( i ) high - eccentricity planets should mostly be found in binary systems ; ( ii ) multi - planet systems should have low eccentricities , since their mutual apsidal precession suppresses the kozai cycle .",
    "also , @xcite argued that even if every extrasolar planet host has an undetected companion , kozai cycles alone can not explain the distribution of observed eccentricities .",
    "( they found that too many planets remained on nearly circular orbits , but that result is sensitive to the initial eccentricity assumed since the time spent near the unstable fixed points at @xmath42 , @xmath43 dominates the period of the kozai cycle , and this time depends strongly on the initial eccentricity ; see @xcite . )",
    "@xcite speculated that kctf might explain the presence of massive planets on orbits close to their parent stars ( `` hot jupiters '' ) , a possibility that we re - examine in this paper .",
    "@xcite elaborated the speculation of @xcite for the orbit of the planet hd 80606b , which is unusual because of its very large eccentricity ( @xmath44 ) and small pericenter distance ( @xmath45  au ) .",
    "@xcite have examined a process similar to kctf for triple black - hole systems that might be found in the centers of galaxies ; here the dissipative force is gravitational radiation rather than tidal friction but much of the formalism is the same .",
    "a major difference is that tidal friction vanishes in a binary with a circular orbit and synchronously rotating stars , while gravitational radiation does not .",
    "therefore the end - state of a black - hole triple subject to the analog of kctf is a merger , leaving a binary black hole ( which may become unbound by the gravitational radiation recoil of the merger ) . in the present application , however , gravitational radiation is negligible .",
    "therefore the stellar and planetary cases offer opportunities to compare the orbits of the observed systems to the distributions predicted by the theory , which this paper quantifies .      in this paper",
    "we shall model kctf using ( i ) the secular approximation for orbital evolution ; ( ii ) the quadrupole approximation for the tidal field from the outer body ; ( iii ) a simple model for apsidal precession that includes the dominant general relativistic precession term and the quadrupole distortion of the stars of the inner binary due to tides and rotation ; ( iv ) a simple model for orbital decay due to tidal friction ; ( v ) the assumption that the outer binary contains most of the angular momentum in the system .",

    "a rotational equilibrium was reached which matched the spin angular velocity to that of the instantaneous orbit angular velocity when tides were the strongest , i.e. , for pericenter passage during the high - eccentricity part of kozai cycles . as dissipation shrunk the semi - major axis ,",
    "pericenter precession became gradually dominated by relativity rather than by the third body .",

    "after @xmath9 equilibrates , a large amount of misalignment will generally remain for the main - sequence lifetime of the star , although slight movement towards alignment occurs because of dissipative tides being raised on the star by the planet .",

    "otherwise , we assumed it disrupted , resulting in an unbound binary and single star ( we do not include those binaries in the following results ) .",

    "we used the following procedure to deduce the final state without a costly integration .",
    "the largest such group is triples whose kozai cycle does not cause pericenter passages close enough for tidal dissipation to be effective . for these we integrated the equations until the first eccentricity maximum and computed the eccentricity damping timescale @xmath222 ( eq .

    "therefore we stopped the integration once the kozai timescale was more than @xmath223 times the pericenter precession period , and evolved the system to @xmath4  gyr by the equations for eccentricity damping neglecting the third body ( see  [ sec : isobin ] ) . in real systems , the third body actually continues to have a modest effect which is not modeled by the orbit - averaged equations of motion @xcite , which we neglect . as long as this timescale criterion was satisfied",

    "these systems either reached the end of their allotted time , which was scaled down from 10 gyr in proportion to the scaling of the viscous time , or stopped oscillating , which allowed the neglect of the third body in integrating the further evolution as above .",
    "figure  [ period_dist ] shows the relation between the initial and final period distributions for the inner binary .",

    "the main result is the strong peak in the distribution of periods near @xmath225  d. the great majority of these systems have evolved onto circular inner binary orbits for which the perturbation of the third star no longer causes interesting effects . as an aside , we note that the initial period distribution of inner binaries ( fig .  [",
    "period_dist]a ) is peaked towards lower values than the initial period distribution of isolated binaries displayed in figure  [ period2body]a ; the latter is simply the @xcite distribution .",
    "this difference is a consequence of the definition of an inner binary , which biases inner binaries to lower periods and outer binaries to higher periods .",
    "let us pause to compare the final period distribution to the observed systems .",
    "in figure  [ compare_tokov ] we plot the fraction of spectroscopic binaries determined to have a tertiary by @xcite .",
    "we also plot a theoretical distribution determined by our integrations .",
    "this distribution was constructed by taking a linear combination of the final period histograms for isolated binaries ( fig .",
    "[ period2body]b ) and for inner binaries of triples ( fig .",
    "[ period_dist]b ) .",
    "two free parameters were determined by fitting the data from @xcite : ( a ) the relative number of triple systems to all systems  both binaries and triples  and ( b ) the primordial cutoff to the period distributions .",
    "the best - fitting proportion of triple systems to all systems is @xmath39 , and the best - fitting primordial cutoff period is @xmath226  d.     and  [ mc - calc ] .",
    "two free parameters were varied to achieve best fit with the observational results : ( a ) the overall fraction of triples relative to all systems ( binaries plus triples)0.25 was best - fit  and ( b ) the cutoff period of the primordial distribution6 d was best - fit , corresponding to histograms in figures  [ period2body]b and [ period_dist]b including only the two darkest shades . ]",
    "these parameters are consistent with independent estimates .",
    "the observations of additional components to binary stars are quite incomplete , but approximately one - third of visual binary stars have an additional component @xcite , consistent with our estimate .",
    "a complication is that the observed mutual inclination distribution of triple stars with long - period inner binaries shows moderate correlation between the inner and outer orbits @xcite .",
    "recent data suggests @xmath227 @xcite , and the distribution can be reasonably represented by the sum of an isotropic distribution ( @xmath218 uniform in @xmath219 $ ] ; 75% of systems ) and a strongly correlated distribution ( @xmath23 uniform in @xmath228 $ ] ; 25% of systems ) .",
    "the former are the systems we have simulated , and the latter do not evolve substantially by kctf .",
    "therefore , due to this correlation , our overall tertiary fraction of @xmath39 may need to be augmented by a factor of @xmath229 , in which case it is still consistent with the triple frequency estimated by tokovinin .",
    "similarly , our best - fitting period cutoff is consistent with the size of protostars , once they become dynamically stable , only contracting on the kelvin - helmholtz timescale .",
    "for example , a solar mass star at an age of @xmath212  yr has a radius of @xmath230 @xcite ; a binary consisting of two such stars in marginal contact would have a period of @xmath231  d.    the comparison with the observed frequency of tertiaries as a function of period is an encouraging confirmation of the importance of kctf for modifying the period distribution of binaries .",
    "we turn now to predictions of the mutual inclination distribution , which can be tested by future observations .",
    "the relationship between initial and final inclinations is illustrated in figure  [ inclination_dist]a for systems with @xmath232 between 3 and 10  d. during kozai cycles , the inclination tends to move away from @xmath31 .",
    "tidal dissipation at maximum eccentricity seals in these more moderate inclinations .",
    "the most interesting feature in the distribution of @xmath233 ( fig .",
    "[ inclination_dist]b ) is the spikes that appear near @xmath234 and @xmath127 .",
    "the shaded histograms show the result broken down by initial inner binary period .",
    "triple systems that start with @xmath235 between 3  d and 10  d , but do not evolve by kctf , contribute a rather isotropic distribution ( lightest shading )",
    ". therefore the spikes are fractionally much stronger if the primordial inner binary period distribution is cut off at a large period .",
    "this inclination distribution is a distinctive feature of kozai cycles , as predicted by the simple model of  [ analsect ] ( see fig .",
    "[ contoureoi]b ) , and therefore would provide unambiguous observational evidence for kctf .     during the high eccentricity phase of a kozai cycle ,",
    "so tidal dissipation during that phase tends to lock in a more moderate mutual inclination .",
    "( b ) histogram of final mutual inclination for these systems .",
    "the strong spikes correspond to the most probable mutual inclinations at the high eccentricity portion of kozai cycles ( compare to fig .",
    "[ contoureoi]b ) .",
    "these spikes are strongest for binaries that have shrunk dramatically by kozai cycles ; e.g. , if primordial binaries with @xmath236  d are rare , about twice as many systems per @xmath237 increment of @xmath23 are expected to inhabit the spikes relative to other configurations . ]    in a small fraction of triples , the third star is close enough ( @xmath238  au ) so that its strong perturbation causes alignment of the inner and outer binaries even after the inner binary s orbit has circularized .",
    "such systems generally evolve to either @xmath239 or @xmath240 ( see fig .  [ inclination_dist]a , but the majority of systems that undergo this process have @xmath241  d ) .",
    "the physical mechanism is that the spins of the stars of the inner binary can not come into alignment with the orbit normal , because of nodal precession due to the third body .",
    "therefore tidal dissipation continues , draining energy from the inner orbit .",
    "here @xmath110 is still approximately conserved ( only a small amount of angular momentum is transfered to the spins ) , so orbit shrinkage requires that the mutual inclination decreases .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed description of this process .",
    "if coplanar triple systems are found with @xmath242 , they might also be interpreted as resulting from fragmentation of a rather thin disk , but an observation of the purely retrograde case ( @xmath243 ) would seem to require this dissipation mechanism .",
    "our simulations yield equal numbers of systems with @xmath244 and @xmath245 , but this is an artifact of our assumption of isotropic initial conditions , which is probably not valid for such compact systems .",
    "now we step back from these small periods to survey the whole range of periods affected by kctf . in figure  [ fig : pvsi ]",
    "we plot the distribution of systems as a function of both @xmath246 and @xmath232 .",
    "the spikes of figure  [ inclination_dist]b are prominent at low periods , but there is another striking feature : a deficit of long - period inner binaries with @xmath247 .",
    "these systems have evolved to lower periods by kctf . here",
    "it is clear that kctf can remove a significant fraction of near - perpendicular systems to small periods , over a wide range of inner binary periods , from @xmath248  d to @xmath2  d. for comparison , consider an initially circular inner binary that undergoes eccentricity growth by the kozai mechanism , then is tidally circularized from @xmath119 at constant orbital angular momentum . by this prescription ,",
    "the locus of initial systems that produce binaries with @xmath249  d is indicated by dashed lines on figure  [ fig : pvsi ] .",
    "systems between those lines may be expected to evolve significantly by kctf , if other sources of pericenter precession are negligible .",
    "the deficit of triple systems with perpendicular orbits was identified by @xcite in the first theoretical paper on kctf , and this effect should be tested by determining the mutual inclination distribution of triple stars .     and",
    "@xmath85 in @xmath246 , which is the same resolution as the tick marks .",
    "the striking paucity of systems with @xmath250 and @xmath251 is due to attrition : systems that started with these values have been removed by kctf to smaller periods .",
    "many of these systems inhabit the spikes of figure  [ inclination_dist]b , which are clear enhancements in this plot .",
    "the region between the dashed lines corresponds to initial values of systems that may lose enough angular momentum by kozai cycles , and enough orbital energy by tidal friction , to circularize to final periods less than 10  d ( see text ) . ]",
    "the final product of kctf is a triple system with a very large period ratio @xmath252 , a circular inner orbit , and a mutual inclination that is often near the critical one . since the distinctive inclination distribution that results from kctf ( fig .",
    "[ inclination_dist]b ) may ultimately provide the strongest observational evidence for this process , it is important to ask whether the inclination persists from the end of kctf to the present .",
    "we point out three mechanisms for changing the mutual inclination but argue that each has a negligible effect .",
    "first , the galactic tide may cause the outer binary to precess .",
    "the precession period for a binary with period @xmath253 is roughly @xmath254 , where @xmath255 is the vertical oscillation period of the star in the galactic disk , with a local value of @xmath256^{1/2 } \\approx 10 ^ 8 { \\rm yr } [ \\rho / ( 0.1 m_\\sun { \\rm pc}^{-3})]^{1/2}$ ] . for the precession period of the outer binary to be less than the age of the galaxy , @xmath257  gyr , we require @xmath258  myr .",
    "that is , the galactic tide can change the orientation of the outer binary substantially only if @xmath259  au .",
    "pericenter precession of the inner binary due to such a distant third body will likely to be overwhelmed by relativistic precession ; equation  ( [ emax_gr ] ) implies that @xmath260 must be @xmath238 for substantial eccentricity oscillations , so kozai cycles will be suppressed unless @xmath261 is very large . for example , an inner binary with an initially circular orbit can only satisfy this constraint if @xmath262  au , given @xmath263 au . for an orbit with @xmath264  au , the pericenter distance @xmath265  au required for substantial tidal friction requires a maximum eccentricity in the kozai cycle given by @xmath266 , and this can only be achieved if the orbits are initially almost exactly perpendicular ( @xmath267 ) .",
    "larger or smaller values of @xmath261 have an even stricter requirement . therefore the number of systems for which kctf yields a close binary , after which the galactic tide reorients the outer binary , is negligibly small .",
    "second , individual passing stars will perturb the outer orbit , changing its orbital elements . the timescale for changing",
    "the outer binary s angular momentum is similar to the timescale of changing its energy , which corresponds to the disruption timescale . for the typical density ( @xmath268 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath269  km / s ) of stars in the disk ,",
    "this timescale is shorter than @xmath4  gyr only for binary semi - major axes above @xmath270  au .",
    "as above , such distant third bodies will not produce short - period inner binaries via kctf with any reasonable frequency , so mutual inclination change by passing stars is also ineffective .",
    "finally , let us specialize to a planet that has migrated by kctf .",
    "generally its orbit will not lie in the host star s equatorial plane , since tidal dissipation in the star will be too weak to align the stellar spin with the planetary orbit ( see  [ rmeffect ] ) .",
    "therefore , the planet induces a spin precession of its host star with a period of @xmath271  yrs . as the stellar spin precesses , the planet s orbit must also precess to conserve angular momentum .",
    "however , the magnitude of the associated change in @xmath23 is @xmath272 , since the orbit of a hot jupiter usually has more angular momentum than the spin of its host , so this effect is unlikely to change the inclination distribution significantly . the thick appearance of the line in the final state in figure  [ kctf_wm]c is this type of oscillation .",
    "stars are born by the fragmentation of molecular clouds .",
    "planets , however , are believed to form in protostellar accretion disks , after material has settled around a star . in binary star systems",
    ", it might be expected that the angular momentum of the disk around each star would come into alignment with the angular momentum of the binary orbit .",
    "the star accretes high angular momentum material from this orbit - aligned disk , so the spin of the host star of the planetary system would likely be in alignment with the companion orbit as well . thus we might expect that both stellar spin angular momenta , the stellar orbital angular momentum about the system barycenter , and the planetary orbital angular momentum around its host star are all aligned if the binary semi - major axis is not too large .",
    "@xcite has measured inclination to the line of sight of the spins of stars in binaries by comparing the rotational period of starspots to the @xmath273 values of rotationally - broadened lines .",
    "if the stellar spins are aligned with each other , they will have zero difference in inclination to the line of sight .",
    "the converse is not true , but the prevalence of alignment can still be assessed statistically .",
    "thus @xcite inferred that binaries are spin - aligned for @xmath274  au , but become randomly oriented for larger orbits .",
    "therefore , for nearly the entire exoplanet sample in binaries , it is likely that the protoplanetary disk was not aligned with the companion s orbit",
    ". therefore planets arising from these non - aligned disks may have a high inclination with respect to the binary companion , so kctf may cause substantial evolution to the orbital distributions of planets in binary systems .",
    "an alternative , but rarer , mechanism to produce non - aligned planets in binary star systems is to form a planetary system around a single star , to which is later added a binary companion through a dynamical interaction in the birth cluster @xcite .    in the past decade",
    ", about 200 giant planets have been discovered , of which about 20% have orbital periods short enough so that tides are important .",
    "the high frequency of close - in planets was a surprise , since planet formation theory suggested that giant planets can only form beyond several au , consistent with the current structure of the solar system .",
    "therefore , a migration mechanism is needed to reduce the angular momentum of these planets by a factor of @xmath275 .",
    "the leading candidate is disk migration , in which torques between the planet and the remnant protoplanetary nebula transfer angular momentum from the planet to the gas @xcite .",
    "there is some statistical evidence that planets orbiting close to one member of a wide binary have different properties  and hence a different formation or migration history  from planets orbiting isolated stars . among short - period radial velocity planets ( @xmath276  d )",
    ", the most massive planets ( @xmath277  jupiter masses ) are preferentially found in binaries @xcite , and these binary companions are close enough ( @xmath278  au ) that kctf may operate @xcite . these short - period , massive planets in binary stars also have lower eccentricities than short - period planets orbiting single stars @xcite . for these systems , kctf provides an alternative migration mechanism to interactions with the protoplanetary nebula .",
    "the predictions of the previous sections for the period and mutual inclination distributions should still apply in the planetary case , and there is an additional prediction of kctf regarding the alignment of the orbital plane with the stellar equatorial plane ( see  [ rmeffect ] below ) .      in the solar system ,",
    "apsidal precession is dominated by the gravitational perturbations from other planets ; in multi - planet systems that are hosted by one member of a binary star , precession from other planets will compete with the precession due to the companion star @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the kozai mechanism could be suppressed by small , undetected masses in the hd 80606 system , since its companion star is distant so the tidal field and precession rate from it are small . @xcite",
    "have investigated the instability of the solar system s giant planets that would be caused by a companion star in an inclined orbit , as a function of inclination and companion mass . @xcite",
    "have investigated how a close ( @xmath279  au ) binary companion , coplanar with the planets , affects their scattering .",
    "the kozai mechanism , in systems in which it operates , may also lead to planet - planet scattering @xcite .",
    "the key to why massive , short - period planets are preferentially found in binaries may lie in the competition between mutual planetary precession and precession due to the companion star , but this is a complicated process and the sign of the predictions is not clear .",
    "take , as an example , an ensemble of planetary systems in which the total mass of the planets is always the same , but the mass assigned to individual planets varies randomly . consider a case in which one planet is substantially more massive than the others .",
    "initially the mutual perturbations of the planets suppress kozai oscillations in all of them .",
    "once moderate eccentricities and inclinations are built up in the planetary system , perhaps by mutual perturbations rather than the kozai mechanism , the small planets become destabilized and are ejected . these ejected bodies",
    "no longer suppress kozai cycles , so now kctf may cause migration for the largest planet . since the kozai cycles depended on the planet ejecting its neighbors , this argument suggests that kctf migration is more effective for more massive planets .    as a foil ,",
    "consider an ensemble of planetary systems in which the total mass of the planets varies randomly , but is always divided into some number @xmath280 of planets of equal mass .",
    "if the total planetary mass is small enough , kozai cycles will proceed unhindered , and one or more planets may migrate by kctf",
    ". the presence of the small planets that failed to suppress kozai cycles may not be detectable with radial velocity surveys , but the planet that migrated may be detected due to the larger reflex velocity that it induces in the star .",
    "this argument suggests that kctf migration is more effective for less massive planets .    since these two arguments yield opposite conclusions , at this time we can make no prediction regarding whether kctf migration favors high or low mass giant planets .",
    "the period distribution produced by kctf ( figure  [ period_dist ] ) is quite similar to the `` pile - up '' of hot jupiters near @xmath3  d @xcite .",
    "we have conducted the following statistical test to look for direct evidence of kctf in the period distribution of the exoplanet sample .",
    "we split the radial velocity planets into two groups : ( 1 ) single planets in a system with multiple stars according to @xcite , and ( 2 ) planets orbiting single stars and planets in multiple - planet systems .",
    "group ( 1 ) contains the systems that could exhibit kozai cycles , now or in the past , since a third body is known and there are not other planets that could suppress kozai cycles .",
    "group ( 2 ) are the planets for which kozai cycles are less likely to be present ( assuming that multiple planetary systems are roughly coplanar and that they suppress kozai cycles driven by a stellar companion ) . there may be systems with single planets and an _ undetected _ third body that causes kozai cycles @xcite , but this possibility simply reduces the power  and should not bias  the statistical test . in figure  [ pcum ]",
    "we plot the cumulative distributions of planetary period for these two groups .",
    "we employ a kolomogorov - smirnov test to assess whether they are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "the biggest gap between the distributions lies at @xmath281  d , actually in the direction opposite from the expectation of kctf ; it is @xmath282 . for @xmath283 and @xmath284 , the probability of having a gap",
    "at least this large is @xmath285 @xcite .",
    "therefore , there is no statistical evidence for kctf in the period distribution of exoplanets .",
    "as noted earlier , @xcite have employed the same test , finding different period distributions for isolated binaries and binaries in triples with a probability of @xmath286 , which supports kctf in triple star systems .",
    "the energy associated with a hot jupiter s orbit is about 10 times its binding energy .",
    "if the planet has a high eccentricity and small pericenter distance , then its radius will inflate from tidal heating as the orbit circularizes @xcite .",
    "for instance , for hd 80606b , which may be undergoing kctf migration currently , @xcite estimate a tidal luminosity of @xmath287  erg  s@xmath288 . for its minimum mass of @xmath231 times that of jupiter , energy deposition at this rate would inflate the radius by about @xmath289 @xcite .",
    "the increased radius will shorten the circularization timescale by a factor of @xmath290 , so the planetary radius should be included in self - consistent integrations of kctf migration .",
    "since the timescale for circularizing is a very strong function of the radius of the planet , the maximum semi - major axis out to which planetary orbits are circularized will be diagnostic of the planetary radius at migration .",
    "there are three massive ( @xmath291  jupiter mass ) exoplanets in binaries whose orbits are circular , two of which ( gl 86b and hd 195019b ) have larger periods ( @xmath292  d and @xmath293  d , respectively ) than exoplanets with circular orbits about single stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that tidal circularization is ineffective at these large periods , but we suggest that this observation , if confirmed in a larger sample , not only supports the kctf hypothesis but also may constrain the amount of inflation that is produced during kctf migration . for this explanation to hold ,",
    "the circularization timescale must remain shorter than the gravitational contraction timescale as the eccentricity tends towards zero .",
    "in the planetary case , the lower limit for the pericenter distance resulting from kozai cycles is set by roche lobe overflow .",
    "if a highly eccentric planetary orbit is circularized , conservation of angular momentum implies that the final radius of the circular orbit is twice the initial pericenter ; thus we expect that the minimum radius of circular orbits produced by kctf is twice the roche limit ( this conclusion is supported by hydrodynamic simulations ; see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the observed semi - major axis distribution of hot jupiters appears to cut off at twice the roche limit @xcite .",
    "this simple argument does not account for the tidal inflation instability of @xcite .",
    "the planet may inflate enough to overflow its roche lobe , then lose mass and increase its semi - major axis . according to @xcite , starting from a large semi - major axis before inflation ( which is natural for migration by kctf ) ,",
    "the planet will not be disrupted but mass loss will eventually halt , leaving the planetary orbit with a period of 1 - 3 weeks and possibly with residual eccentricity .",
    "some of the mass lost from the planet may be accreted onto the host star , leading to pollution of the star s photosphere with metals .",
    "two stars that form a binary are likely to have the same bulk metallicity , so enhanced photospheric metallicity in the star hosting a hot jupiter is evidence for accretion of planet material after the pre - main sequence stage . furthermore , if isotopes that are known to be destroyed in stars ( e.g. , @xmath294li ) are found in large abundance , a constraint on when the planetary material accreted can be given @xcite .    these effects may be tested for the planet hat - p-1b @xcite , a transiting planet in a binary stellar system .",
    "it could be in the final stages of circularization after kctf migration , which would lead both to some residual eccentricity and to an inflated radius ; the latter is securely observed .      in close binary star systems , including those brought close by kctf",
    ", the spins of the stars are expected to align with the orbital angular momentum in a timescale short compared to the circularization timescale . however",
    ", a star s spin probably does not align with the orbital angular momentum of a hot jupiter it hosts because of the small mass of the planet ( see table  [ table : spins ] ) .",
    "a measurement of @xmath87 , the angle between the stellar spin angular momentum and the planet orbital momentum , can therefore constrain the history of the system .",
    ".expected alignment properties of most triples after kctf .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : alignment ]    alternatively , the timing of migration can be strongly constrained by the precise alignment of the transiting planet hd 189733b @xcite . according to @xcite",
    "there is an m - dwarf companion at a projected distance of 219 au , and preliminary measurements exclude coplanarity between the inner and outer orbits at the @xmath295 level .",
    "if the outer orbit s misalignment is confirmed , it may be possible to constrain the timescale of formation and disk migration to less than about @xmath296  myr , assuming the planet formed with a period of about @xmath4  yr and migrated before torque from the companion caused misalignment .",
    "further , the precession of a planet s orbital plane due to its host star s rotational bulge may be detectable through a changing transit duration @xcite .",
    "large misalignment , which is common according to figure  [ fig : spinorbit ] , causes a large observable effect .",
    "we have described the evolution and final orbital element distribution of binary stars resulting from the combined effects of the gravitational influence of a tertiary companion star and tidal friction . in particular , we show that kozai cycles plus tidal friction ( kctf ) can strongly enhance the number of binary stars with periods in the range 0.1 d to 10 d ; briefly , the distant companion induces strong eccentricity oscillations ( kozai cycles ) in systems in which the inner and outer binary orbital planes are nearly perpendicular , and these eccentric orbits are circularized near pericenter by tidal friction .",
    "the logarithmic period distribution of inner binaries produced by kctf shows a peak near 3  d and declines from 3  d to 10  d. these features are consistent with the empirical period distribution of inner binaries of hierarchical systems found by @xcite , and we confirm these authors interpretation that kctf is the cause of this feature",
    ". therefore kctf appears to produce most close binaries .",
    "the dominance of kctf for producing close binaries may be confirmed by testing our prediction of a modified mutual inclination distribution .",
    "we expect an enhancement of systems with mutual inclination close to the critical values of @xmath126 or @xmath127 if @xmath66 is in the range @xmath3-@xmath4  d. interferometric measurements have been determining the mutual inclination in triple stars with inner periods small enough for tides to be important @xcite , and with improvements in limiting magnitude and precision they will be able to measure enough systems to test this theoretical prediction .",
    "planetary inclination angles relative to a stellar companion will in some cases be measurable by _",
    "sim planetquest_.    as the observations improve , the present theory should be augmented to refine the predictions .",
    "in particular , most of the systems in the spikes in the inclination distribution ( fig .",
    "[ inclination_dist]b ) have @xmath297 , so our assumption that the outer binary dominates the angular momentum is only marginally valid . a more accurate model for the known three - body gravitational dynamics may also have some effect on the period distribution produced by kctf .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that including octupole terms in the interaction hamiltonian causes kozai cycles to be quasi - periodic , and some pericenter approaches can be much closer than those computed with quadrupole terms alone ( their fig . 5 ) .",
    "these closer approaches may lead to smaller final periods after circularization than we have predicted .",
    "another aspect of the present theory that could be improved is modeling dynamical tides as well as , or instead of , the equilibrium tide .",
    "this more sophisticated tidal theory follows how the tidal force excites free modes of oscillation in each star and how these modes are damped",
    ". it may be useful in the present application , in which high eccentricities are common and the timescale of pericenter passage is comparable to the periods of oscillation modes .",
    "however , the natural first step to refine the present analysis is to improve the model of point - mass gravitational interactions ( which are completely understood ) before attempting to improve the model of tidal interactions ( which are quite uncertain ) .",
    "we have investigated the period distribution that is produced by kctf alone and found that it preferentially produces detached binaries with @xmath298  d. however , over a timescale of a few billion years , magnetic winds may be able to extract enough angular momentum from such a binary so that its components come into contact or even merge @xcite .",
    "a combination of kctf and magnetic braking could therefore increase the space density of _ contact _ binaries .",
    "kctf and magnetic winds have often been regarded as competing theories of angular momentum loss for close binaries . however , both are simple additions of an extra star to well - grounded empirical relations : angular momentum loss by magnetic winds adds a binary companion to the spin - down process of single stars , and kctf adds a third star to the circularization process of close binary stars .",
    "therefore we believe both mechanisms must be operating at some level , and their relative contribution to the orbital evolution of close binaries is an interesting subject for future work .",
    "we have considered hierarchical triple systems in the field of the galaxy , where the space density of stars is small enough that the triples are presumably dynamically isolated ( see , for instance ,  [ finali ] ) .",
    "of course , triples could exhibit kctf while embedded in a cluster of stars , where the dynamics would be much richer .",
    "the outer binary of a primordial triple would be susceptible to disruption or reorientation by , or exchange with , passing stars during kctf . also , dynamical interactions may _ add _ a third body to primordial binaries ( at least temporarily )",
    ", in which case the uncorrelated orientations of inner and outer binaries will be above the critical inclination @xmath299  77% of the time , so kozai oscillations will be the norm . some of these effects have been captured by the integrations of @xcite , who added tidal dissipation to an n - body simulation of a star cluster .",
    "a prime target for theorists is to explain the period distribution of binaries in the young , nearby hyades cluster .",
    "its period distribution ( for all binaries , not just inner binaries of hierarchical systems ) shows a secondary peak at a few days that has eluded explanation @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "angular momentum loss by magnetic winds can not account for this feature  it tends to reduce the number of binaries at such periods , whereas a mechanism is needed to pile binaries up there .",
    "we suggest that kctf may be that mechanism . to evaluate this hypothesis quantitatively , the above effects would need to be taken into account , as well as the cluster s young age which implies that kctf has not yet progressed to completion in all cases .",
    "kctf should first establish binaries with periods less than 3 d in only a few kozai cycles , then slowly add longer - period binaries over tens to hundreds of kozai cycles ( as an example , see the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : spinorbit ] ) .",
    "this prediction may be tested by surveying clusters of different ages .",
    "although kctf appears to produce most close binary stars , kctf may produce some but not most hot jupiters , for two reasons .",
    "first , systems with one planet orbiting a star of a binary system ( i.e. , those for which kozai cycles are likely ) have a planetary period distribution that is statistically indistinguishable from other planetary systems  see  [ sec : planetperiods ] and figure  [ pcum ] .",
    "second , the limited information on spin - orbit alignment for the four stars in table  [ table : alignment ] suggests that most host spins and planetary orbits are aligned , contrary to the prediction of kctf  see  [ rmeffect ] and figure  [ fig : spinorbit ] . for an individual binary star system that hosts a transiting planet , however",
    ", large misalignment detected by the rossiter - mclaughlin effect would constitute strong evidence for kctf in that system .",
    "@xcite have shown that massive , short - period planets also tend to have binary companions within a few hundred au , but those authors do not favor kctf migration because two of those planets have periods apparently too long for tidal dissipation to be important .",
    "however , during the period of extreme eccentricity set up by kozai cycles , the planet s radius would expand due to the heat generated by tides , enhancing tidal friction .",
    "perhaps this effect can circularize planetary orbits to greater periods . to evaluate this suggestion theoretically ,",
    "planetary radius inflation must be modeled during calculations of kctf .",
    "another worthwhile theoretical investigation would be the the suppression of kozai cycles by mutual planetary perturbations .",
    "we conclude by reviewing the predictions of kctf : ( 1 ) period distributions for hot jupiters and close binaries in systems with stellar companions have a peak at a few days and a minimum at longer periods ( @xmath248  d ) for which tidal circularization becomes ineffective .",
    "( 2 ) for triples in which the inner binary has a period between @xmath3 and @xmath4  d , there is an enhancement of systems whose mutual inclination between inner and outer binaries is near @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; for triples with longer inner periods , there is a paucity of systems with nearly perpendicular orbits . ( 3 ) hot jupiters resulting from kctf migration generally have orbital angular momentum misaligned with the stellar spin axis by large angles , frequently even larger than @xmath31 , and they may have orbits circularized to greater periods than for hot jupiters orbiting single stars due to inflation of the planetary radius during migration .",
    "the role of kctf in the formation of close binary stars and hot jupiters can be tested by measurements of the following quantities in carefully defined samples of stars : ( 1 ) the period distribution of close binaries that have a tertiary component ; ( 2 ) the mutual inclination distribution of triples , in order to detect the enhancement of systems near the critical angles ( these measurements will normally require interferometry ) ; ( 3 ) the angle between stellar spin angular momentum and planetary orbital angular momentum for planets hosted by stellar binaries , using the rm effect , transit timing , or determination of the orbit of the outer binary for transiting planets ; ( 4 ) differential measurements of metallicity in stars in binary systems that host planets , to detect stellar pollution from overflow of the roche lobe of the planet ; ( 5 ) the distributions of mass , eccentricity , and period for hot jupiters .",
