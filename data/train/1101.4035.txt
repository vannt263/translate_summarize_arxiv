    "<S> we derive relations between polarized transverse momentum dependent distribution functions ( tmds ) and the usual parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the 3d covariant parton model , which follow from lorentz invariance and the assumption of a rotationally symmetric distribution of parton momenta in the nucleon rest frame . using the known pdf @xmath0 as input </S>",

    "<S> there is some similarity to @xmath29 which also changes sign , and is given in the model by @xcite @xmath30 the @xmath31function implies that , for our choice of the light - cone direction , large @xmath1 are correlated with large and negative @xmath32 , while low @xmath1 are correlated with large and positive @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath33  changes sign , because the integrand in ( [ sp11 ] ) changes sign between the extreme values of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark , that the calculation of @xmath33 based on the relation ( [ sp11 ] ) well agrees @xcite with the experimental data .    the other tmds ( [ eq : all - tmds ] ) can be calculated similarly and differ , in the limit @xmath34 , by simple @xmath1-dependent prefactors @xmath35 the resulting plots are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ff4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we do not plot @xmath36 since this tmd is equal to @xmath37 in our approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us remark , that @xmath14 is the only tmd which can change sign . </S>",
    "<S> the other tmds have all definite signs , which follows from ( [ eq : all - tmds ] ,  [ e5 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note also that pretzelosity @xmath38 , due to the prefactor @xmath39 , has the largest absolute value among all tmds . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , pretzelosity is related to quark orbital angular momentum in some quark models @xcite , including the present approach @xcite .    to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that an experimental check of the predicted tmds requires care . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , tmds are not directly measurable quantities unlike structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> what one can measure for instance in semi - inclusive dis is a convolution with a quark fragmentation function . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally dilutes  the effects of tmds , and makes it difficult to observe for instance the prominent sign change in the helicity distribution , see fig . </S>",
