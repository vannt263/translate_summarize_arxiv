    "wigner function was originally introduced to provide a phase - space representation of the state of a quantum - mechanical system described in a continuous hilbert space @xcite .",
    "wigner function is termed a  quasi - distribution \" , as it may become negative in some portions of phase space @xcite .",
    "indeed , as is well known , quantum mechanics ( qm ) precludes a proper joint probability distribution of position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 .",
    "however , in many respects wigner function plays a role similar to the phase space distribution function in classical statistical mechanics @xcite ; therefore , we find it natural to inquire whether one can relate it to appropriate measurements involving the position and momentum of the system .",
    "the idea we shall develop is to introduce the first stage of the measurement , or  pre - measurement \" , explicitly in the qm description , by coupling , successively in time , the system observables we wish to study to auxiliary degrees of freedom , or _  probes \" _ , and detect the probes , not the system itself .",
    "this procedure represents a generalization of von neumann s model of measurement @xcite . specifically , we shall couple projectors associated with the system position and momentum to two independent probes , at times @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that one can relate wigner function to correlations of observables each belonging to one of the two probes which , being distinct degrees of freedom and external to the system , _ are compatible _ and admit a joint probability distribution .",
    "these probe correlations are thus experimentally accessible",
    ".    we shall first relate wigner s function to the so - called kirkwood joint quasi - probability distribution of position and momentum @xcite which is , in general , a complex quantity .",
    "it is then kirkwood s distribution which can be expressed in terms of the above mentioned probe correlations , in the limit in which the coupling becomes very weak .    in a historical context",
    ", it is interesting to mention that kirkwood introduced the joint quasi - probability distribution in phase space that bears his name a year later than wigner introduced his , and with similar motivations related to statistical mechanics applications . in the next decade",
    "dirac introduced essentially the same joint quasi - probability distribution for non - commuting observables , with the aim of  discussing trajectories for the motion of a particle in qm \" .",
    "we should remark that in the field of quantum optics , wigner function has been related to a set of measurable quantities different from the ones considered in the present paper , namely , quadrature distributions which are experimentally available , a method that constitutes an application to qm of the computer - aided tomography scan @xcite .",
    "other quasi - distributions have been proposed in the literature : e.g. , ref .",
