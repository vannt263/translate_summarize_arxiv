    "point like off nuclear x - ray sources with luminosities well in excess of the eddington limit for a stellar mass black hole , have been discovered in a large number of nearby galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . these ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are too dim to be low luminosity agns and too bright to be normal x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) emitting below the eddington limit . in this paper",
    "we define a ulx as a source with bolometric luminosity in excess of the eddington limit for a stellar mass black hole of @xmath0 and less luminous than a few @xmath1 .",
    "this definition implies that a galactic xrb radiating isotropically at or below the eddington limit can not be a ulx .",
    "in spiral or starburst galaxies ulxs turn out to be associated with star forming regions , emission nebulae and stellar clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these facts along with , in some case , the detection of stellar optical counterparts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) strongly indicate an association between ulxs and young massive stars , although the nature of the accreting compact object remains unclear .    a certain number of ulxs , however , appear as isolated x - ray sources with no obvious counterpart at any wavelength ( @xcite ) and without a clear association with star forming regions or emission nebulae .",
    "some low - luminosity ulxs may possibly be present also in elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) , but their nature and the actual evidence for their existence is not well established ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the ulxs in spiral galaxies is less controversial .",
    "different models have been proposed to explain the large luminosities reached by these sources .",
    "one of the favored models consists of an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) with a mass in the range @xmath2 , accreting from an high mass donor star .",
    "the presence of an imbh can account for most of the observational properties of ulxs in a rather straightforward way .",
    "for instance , the observed cool disc spectra of some ulx can be explained with the fact that the innermost stable circular orbit of an imbh is larger than that of a stellar mass black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of a @xmath350 - 160 mhz quasi periodic oscillations in the power density spectrum of m82 x-1 and ngc5408 x-1 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the very high luminosity of some ulxs ( @xmath4 ) along with their cool discs , and the energy content and morphology of the nebulae around some of them ( @xcite ) all suggest an imbh interpretation .",
    "the main problem with this interpretation resides in the formation mechanism of such an extreme object .",
    "in fact , if imbhs with masses in excess of @xmath5 exist , they will require a new formation root with respect to the stellar black holes in our galaxy and to the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei . until now two scenarios have been proposed to form a black hole in the intermediate mass range : the runaway collision of massive stars in dense open clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the primordial collapse of a very high mass star with zero metallicity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both the mechanisms however suffer of a certain degree of uncertainty related to the incomplete knowledge of the behavior of very massive stars .",
    "therefore we have no final evidence that an imbh can really form .",
    "furthermore , the interpretation of the soft components observed in some ulxs in terms of cool accretion discs is not univocal ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "other interpretations in terms of stellar ( or quasi - stellar ) mass black holes have been proposed .",
    "a mechanical ( @xcite ) or a relativistic beaming ( @xcite ) can reproduce the observed luminosities of ulxs up to a few @xmath6 with a beaming factor around @xmath7 at most , as suggested by @xcite , accretion from helium rich matter from a geometrically thick disc can generate luminosities up to @xmath8 .",
    "however , luminosities in excess of @xmath9 ( @xmath10% of the ulx population ) and the isotropy of the ionized nebulae around some ulxs can not be easily explained in terms of beaming models . on the other hand , photon bubbles disc instabilities ( @xcite , @xcite ) and emission from a slim disc ( @xcite , @xcite ) can produce genuine isotropic super - eddington luminosities around 10 times the eddington limit .    as shown by @xcite , a normal binary with a stellar mass black hole and a donor star with initial mass @xmath11 ,",
    "can in principle explain a large sample of ulxs if a super eddington luminosity around @xmath12 is allowed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the typical temperature of a slim disc in this regime ( @xmath3 12 kev ) is inconsistent with the observation of some cool disc sources which are , at the same time , the most luminous ulxs .",
    "furthermore , luminosities in excess of a few @xmath6 are not attainable with slim discs around stellar mass black holes . on the other hand",
    ", the photon bubble instability model makes no predictions on the observable accretion disc temperature and therefore can not be compared directly with observations .",
    "thanks to the high precision astrometry of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , we know that some ulxs have optical counterparts which match with the x - ray source position ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of them are suspected to be main sequence ( ms ) high mass stars or supergiant stars of uncertain spectral type .",
    "the ambiguity arises because , until now , optical spectra of these stars either are not available , or they are too noisy and with peculiar spectral features ( @xcite ) , or there is more than an optical counterpart in the x - ray error box ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present the evolutionary tracks of binary systems with high mass companion stars and stellar - through - intermediate mass bhs and compare them with the properties of the donor stars in ulx binary systems . in ",
    "2 we present the model adopted to evolve the binary system . in  3 , we summarize the properties of the four ulxs considered and their optical counterparts .",
    "our results are presented in  4 and compared with the properties of ulx counterparts in  5 .",
    "conclusions follow in  6 .",
    "we consider a binary system with a stellar mass bh ( 10 @xmath13 ) or an imbh ( @xmath14 ) and a companion star that is orbiting around it and eventually transferring matter onto it .",
    "the evolution of the binary is computed using an updated version of the eggleton code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation follows that presented in @xcite .",
    "we assume a population i chemical composition ( y=0.28 , z=0.02 ) and allow for non - conservative stellar evolution , taking into account wind loss from luminous stars ( ) . the adopted mixing length parameter and overshooting constant",
    "are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "loss of angular momentum is also accounted for through emission of gravitational waves ( see e.g. @xcite ) and particles in winds ( @xcite ) .",
    "if accretion occurs via roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) , we assume that an accretion disc will form . in this work",
    "we adopt an efficiency @xmath17 for the conversion of gravitational potential energy into radiation in a disc .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the x - ray source is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the average mass transfer rate from the donor as computed from the numerical code .    in case accretion",
    "occurs via mass loss from a stellar wind ( wind - fed accretion ; wfa ) , the situation is somewhat different if one considers stellar mass bhs or imbhs , as the latter are bigger and have a stronger gravitational potential well .",
    "hence , owing to the larger gravitational capture radius , a comparatively larger fraction of the wind emitted by the donor star can be captured at corresponding orbital separations .",
    "furthermore , a large fraction of the accreting particles have a significant orbital angular momentum .",
    "this might be sufficient to form an accretion disc even in a wind - fed system with a imbh , although further investigations are required to completely understand the geometry of these discs . in the following",
    "we will limit our analysis only to wfa systems with imbhs . for the wfa model",
    "we adopt a modified version of the rlof model , adding an equation to compute the wfa accretion rate ( as described in @xcite ) .",
    "an accretion disc is assumed to form also in this case but , unless the donor is very massive ( @xmath20 , not considered in this work ) , the accretion rate is essentially negligible .",
    "the evolution of a binary system containing a bh / imbh depends on the initial orbital separation .",
    "the companion star can fall in three different zones , defined in terms of the zero - age / terminal - age main sequence ( zams / tams ) radius of the donor @xmath21/@xmath22 , the tidal radius of the system @xmath23 and the roche lobe radius of the companion @xmath24 .",
    "the expressions of these radii are ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to the donor star , @xmath28 is the black hole mass , @xmath29 is the mass ratio , and @xmath30 is the orbital separation .    in a reference frame centered on the bh / imbh ,",
    "the * first zone * lies between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if the companion star enters in the first zone , it is disrupted by the strong tidal forces of the bh , likely resulting in an outburst of short duration ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . this possibility is not considered in the present work",
    ".    the * second zone * is defined as the interval of orbital separations where the stellar surface can reach contact with the roche lobe radius @xmath24 sometime during ms . in the following",
    "we will refer to the binaries whose donor falls in the second zone as `` case a '' systems . in order for the initial orbital separation to be in this range , either the companion star is tidally captured by the bh / imbh ( @xcite , @xcite ) or the binary system undergoes an exchange interaction with another star ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    if the initial orbital separation @xmath30 is such that @xmath33 , the companion is in the * third zone*. in this zone , mass transfer occurs through rlof only when the donor is in the h - shell phase ( case b ) or during the he - shell burning ( case c ) .",
    "if the star falls in this zone , during the main sequence the only possible accretion mechanism is the gravitational capture of wind particles .",
    "wfa imbhs systems can reach ulx luminosities even if the orbital separation is a few astronomical units , thanks to the enhanced gravitational focusing effect of the imbh . however , for larger separations , the source is fainter and has a mean luminosity typical of bright galactic xrbs ( see @xcite for an extended discussion ) . if the initial separation is very large ( usually several tens of astronomical units ) , neither rlof nor wfa are possible , and the system evolves essentially as a detached , non - interacting binary .",
    "the accretion disc around a bh is steadily fueled if the mass transfer rate from the donor exceeds the critical mass transfer rate ( @xcite ) : @xmath34 the critical mass accretion rate given above takes already into account the stabilizing effect of the increase in temperature due to the disc self - irradiation . in our model ,",
    "all the imbh systems accreting through rlof turn out to be persistent if the donor mass is higher than @xmath35 , in agreement with the findings of @xcite and @xcite . for a stellar mass bh the stability of the disc",
    "is guaranteed down to donor masses @xmath36 .",
    "assuming that equation  [ [ crit ] ] holds also for wfa discs around imbhs , thermal instabilities are likely to arise .",
    "in fact , the mass transfer rate in wfa systems is smaller than that in rlof systems .",
    "all the imbh wfa systems with a donor star lighter than 30@xmath37 might experience transient accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "stars heavier than 30@xmath38 likely produce a transient phase during the early ms ( when the mass transfer rate is small ) and a persistent phase during the late ms ( when the mass transfer is higher than the critical mass transfer rate ) .",
    "so we expect rapid outbursts and quiescent states ( similar to those observed in galactic transient xrbs ) in low mass companion wfa systems and , in general , during the early evolution of wfa systems .",
    "the recurrence time and duty cycle are difficult to estimate . as in a dynamical exchange interaction",
    "it is highly probable that the companion star falls in the * third zone * , wfa systems might be rather common .",
    "thus , a significant population of imbh binaries that appear as transient ulxs or even transient xrbs might exist in external galaxies or even in our own galaxy .",
    "some sources of this transient ulx population start to be identified ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an important effect to consider when assessing the properties of ulx counterparts is the possible strong optical - uv contamination caused by the emission of the accretion disc itself and , in case of isotropic emission , also by the reprocessed x - ray radiation .",
    "the main reprocessing sites are the outer part of the accretion disc and the donor surface .",
    "we follow the evolution of the optical luminosity and colors of the binary system taking irradiation effects into account .",
    "our calculation relies on the same assumptions discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a standard shakura - sunyaev disc ( e.g. @xcite ) is assumed and both the x - ray irradiation of the companion and the self - irradiation of the disc are accounted for . however , in order to keep our treatment simple , the companion star is taken to be spherical and at uniform temperature , neglecting the effects produced by the roche lobe geometry and also those related to the ( possible ) deformation induced by radiation pressure .",
    "we adopt a simplified description of radiative transfer for the interaction of the x - rays with the disc and donor surfaces ( a x - ray illuminated plane - parallel atmosphere in radiative equilibrium ) and do not include limb and gravity darkening .",
    "the shadowing of the disc on the star is continuously monitored during the whole evolution and never overcomes @xmath3 15% .",
    "the computed luminosity and colors depend on the masses of the donor and bh , the binary period ( or orbital separation ) , the accretion rate and the ( unirradiated ) temperature of the donor , in addition to the inclination angle @xmath39 and the orbital phase @xmath40 that are kept fixed at @xmath41 ( disc face - on ) and @xmath42 ( superior conjunction ) .",
    "the accretion efficiency and the albedo of the donor surface layers were chosen to be 0.17 and 0.9 respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we took the hardness ratio @xmath43 .",
    "the absorption parameters in the same two spectral bands were selected as @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the r , v and b magnitudes of the ( irradiated ) disc plus donor have been computed using the output values of the parameters provided by the binary evolution code . in particular ,",
    "the accretion rate is instantaneously taken to be equal to the mass transfer rate from the companion . when the accretion rate overcomes @xmath46 , we impose @xmath47 and assume that the excess mass is expelled from the system .",
    "the purpose of our work is to provide a tool for comparing the observational properties of ulxs with identified optical companions with those predicted for the donors of our bh / imbh binary model . as reference cases , we consider four ulxs for which sufficient information on the optical counterparts are available to allow a meaningful comparison .",
    "they are : ngc1313 x-2 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , holmberg ii x-1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ngc4559 x-7 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and m81 x-9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "none of the ulxs considered have a unique optical counterpart . in the case of ngc1313 x-2 , there are two optical counterparts in the _ chandra _ error box , identified on _ vlt _ and _ hst _ images .",
    "photometry and modeling of the donor emission are consistent with the following interpretation : an early b ms star of @xmath48 and a red / yellow supergiant of @xmath49 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for the three other ulxs , only optical photometry is available , and the nature of the donor star is still uncertain .",
    "fits of the x - ray spectra of these ulxs have been carried out by several authors .",
    "parameters of the best fit obtained with different models are listed in table  [ tab1 ] and are used to obtain an estimate of the total x - ray luminosity of the system , extrapolating the flux in the energy range @xmath50 using the web interface to pimms ( webpimms v. 3.9c ) . for m81 x-9 we adopt the bolometric luminosity reported by @xcite .

    "is @xmath17 .",
    ", width=321 ]      when the donor star starts a case b or c mass transfer , the evolution of the binary may be completely different with respect to what reported above .",
    "if the contact phase sets in at the beginning of the hertzsprung gap , when the donor radius is still relatively small ( e.g. @xmath51 for a 15@xmath37 donor ) , the contact phase is extremely short lived ( a few @xmath52 ) and @xmath19 can reach a few @xmath53 ( in some cases up to @xmath54 ) .",
    "the tracks on the cm diagram are similar to those calculated for case a , with a turnoff during the h - shell burning at the point where the system becomes detached .",
    "if the contact phase sets in at the end of the hertzsprung gap ( @xmath55 for a 15@xmath37 donor ) or later ( case c mass transfer ) , @xmath19 is comparable to that of a case a mass transfer binary during h - shell burning , but now the donor enters the region of the single giant stars on the cm diagram and the differences with the case a tracks become sharp .    in this situation all the previously excluded optical counterparts of ngc4559 x-7 ( objects 2 , 3 and 4 ) become good candidates , while objects 1 , 5 , 6 and 8 are ruled out . in the case of ngc",
    "1313 x-2 , both counterparts can be excluded . in particular ,",
    "object c2 can be definitively ruled out as its position is not consistent with any irradiated or non - irradiated track . also",
    "the counterparts of holmberg ii x-1 and m81 x-9 are not consistent with any case b or c binary system",
    ". finally , the most massive donors ( m@xmath5630@xmath38 ) are too bright at this stage to be proposed as candidate counterparts regardless of the compact object mass .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the effects of the binary evolution on the optical properties of a donor star in a ulx binary system can significantly alter its colors and evolution .",
    "we included also the contribution of the optical emission of the accretion disc and the x - ray irradiation of the donor and disc surfaces .",
    "the evolutionary track of a donor in an accreting binary on the cm diagram is very different with respect to that of a single isolated star .",
    "these important differences can not be overlooked when trying to identify the donor mass of a ulx .",
    "we calculated tracks for stellar and intermediate mass black holes , and demonstrate the brighter nature of the imbh as an intrinsic phenomenon produced by the low mass ratio in the binary .",
    "the photometric data of four ulx counterparts have been compared with the evolutionary tracks of massive donors on the cm diagram .",
    "we find that the counterparts 2 , 3 and 4 of ngc 4559 x-7 are consistent only with donors of @xmath12@xmath57 undergoing a case b or c mass transfer episode .",
    "the only possibility for objects 5 and 8 is a very massive ( @xmath58 ) ms donor or a h - shell burning donor with mass between 10 - 15 and 30@xmath38 .",
    "finally , object 1 is compatible only with a very massive ( @xmath59 ) donor in a h - shell burning phase .",
    "our results are quite different with respect to what obtained in previous analysis .",
    "@xcite compared theoretical evolutionary tracks of single stars between 9 and 25@xmath38 with the position in the cm diagram of the counterparts of ngc4559 x-7 .",
    "they find that the colors and luminosity of six out of seven stars are consistent with the tracks of main sequence , blue or red supergiant with masses in the range 10 - 15 @xmath13 and ages @xmath60 myr .",
    "their favored counterpart , object 1 , was identified with a main sequence or blue supergiant of @xmath61 and an age of @xmath62 myr , although @xcite recognize that x - ray irradiation may affect its colors and hence its classification .",
    "irradiation effects were taken into account by @xcite , giving a donor mass of 5 - 20@xmath37 for object @xmath63 . in their work , however , @xcite considered irradiation on single stars and did not take into account the effects of the markedly different evolution of a donor star in a binary system .    as far as ngc1313 x-2 is concerned , we definitely rule out the candidate counterpart c2 and identify c1 as a h - shell burning donor of 10@xmath64m@xmath6515@xmath38 around a stellar mass black hole or a @xmath66 donor undergoing rlof during ms ( or the h - shell burning phase ) in an imbh binary system . on statistical grounds alone , it is then more likely that ngc1313 x-2 hosts a @xmath67 bh rather than a stellar mass bh as the h - shell burning phase is much shorter than the ms phase . our result for object c2",
    "leaves only c1 as the likely counterpart of ngc 1313 x-2 , in agreement with the evidence coming from the refined x - ray astrometry of the field recently reported by @xcite . on the basis of single star isochrone fitting of the parent stellar population , @xcite and @xcite estimate a maximum ms mass of 89@xmath38 for object c1 .",
    "@xcite find consistency with either a @xmath68 star of very low metallicity or an o spectral type , solar metellicity star of @xmath69 .",
    "our estimated range of donor masses for object c1 appears more in agreement with the value ( 10 - 18@xmath38 ) reported by @xcite , probably because they also included the contribution of the disc and irradiation effects . in holmberg",
    "ii x-1 there are several possibilities , and we can only rule out stars with m@xmath6510@xmath38 ( @xcite give a lower bound of 5@xmath38 ) , while for m81 x-9 we are left with the unique possibility that the donor is a @xmath70 star in the h - shell burning phase .",
    "we conclude therefore that in all previous work where the binary evolution and/or irradiation effects ware not taken into account , the donor mass has been systematically overestimated .",
    "we find that mass transfer occurring at late stages is very unlikely , not only for the short timescale of the contact phase ( @xmath71@xmath72yrs ) but also for the incompatibility of the optical colors with the majority of the observed counterparts . if mass transfer sets in during ms , two contact phases occur ( segments a  b and c  d ) .",
    "the mass transfer timescales are @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( depending on the donor mass ) . therefore assuming a flat distribution of periods between 1 and @xmath310 days , as during ms the contact phase is reached for @xmath75days",
    ", we expect a factor @xmath76@xmath77 more main sequence systems than h - shell burning donors .",
