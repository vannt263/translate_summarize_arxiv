    "high - precision experiments on cold atoms , such as spin - polarized @xmath0rb , in traps have provided powerful methods for the study of quantum phase transitions  @xcite , e.g. , the transition from a superfluid ( sf ) to a bosonic mott - insulator ( mi ) in an optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "this transition was predicted by mean - field studies  @xcite and obtained in monte - carlo simulations  @xcite of the bose - hubbard model before it was seen in experiments  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have investigated a heteronuclear degenerate mixture of two bosonic species , e.g. , @xmath0rb and @xmath1k , in a three - dimensional optical lattice ; such mixtures have also been studied theoretically  @xcite and by monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "systems of alkali atoms with nuclear spin @xmath2 have hyperfine spin @xmath3 ; examples include @xmath4na , @xmath5k , and @xmath0rb ; these spins are frozen in magnetic traps , so these atoms are treated as spinless bosons ; however , in purely optical traps , such spins can form spinor condensates  @xcite .",
    "thus , we consider the following three types of bose - hubbard ( bh ) models : ( 1 ) a bh model for spinless interacting bosons of one type ; ( 2 ) a generalization of the spinless bh model with two types of bosons ; and ( 3 ) a spin-1 generalization of the spinless bh model with bosons of one type .",
    "we study these models by developing extensions of an inhomogeneous mean - field theory  @xcite , which has been used for the bose - glass phase in the disordered bh model .",
    "in addition to the optical - lattice potential , a confining potential , which is typically quadratic , is present in all experiments .",
    "this inhomogeneous potential leads to inhomogeneities in the phases that are obtained : simulations  @xcite of the bose - hubbard model with this confining potential and experiments  @xcite on interacting bosons in optical lattices with a confining potential have both seen alternating shells of sf and mi regions in the single - species , spinless case .",
    "we explore such shells via the inhomogeneous mean - field theory , first for single - species , spinless bosons and then for the two - species and spin-1 generalizations mentioned above .",
    "mean - field theories for the bose - hubbard model were first developed for the homogeneous case  @xcite ; these theories were then extended to the inhomogeneous case  @xcite to develop an understanding of the bose - glass phase in the disordered bose - hubbard model .",
    "we show that bh models with confining potential can be treated , at the level of mean - field theory , as was done in the bose - glass case  @xcite ; in particular , we provide a natural framework for understanding alternating sf and mi shells , which are seen in simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite on interacting bosons , trapped in a confining potential , and in an optical lattice .",
    "though other groups  @xcite have studied such shell structure theoretically , they have not obtained the quantitative agreement with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  @xcite that we obtain , except in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our theory yields results in good agreement with a variety of experiments ; and it can be generalized easily to ( a ) two species of interacting bosons and ( b ) the spin-@xmath6 case , as we show explicitly for @xmath7 ; in both these cases we provide interesting predictions that will , we hope , stimulate new experiments .",
    "our inhomogeneous mean - field calculations can be carried out with experimentally realistic parameters , so we can make direct comparison with experiments . in particular , we obtain in - trap density distributions of alternating sf and mi shells ; these show plateaux in certain regions , which can be understood on the basis of simple geometrical arguments .",
    "furthermore , we obtain the radii of sf and mi shells from in - trap density distributions and demonstrate how the phase diagram of the homogeneous bose - hubbard model can be obtained from these radii . we also obtain results that are of direct relevance to recent atomic - clock - shift experiments  @xcite . with two species of bosons",
    "we obtain phase diagrams in the homogeneous case over a far wider range of parameters than has been reported hitherto .",
    "we find rich phase diagram with phases that include ones in which ( a ) both types of bosons are in sf states , ( b ) both types of bosons are in mi phases with different or the same densities , and ( c ) one type of boson is in an sf phase whereas the other type is in an mi phase .",
    "we show that each of these phases appear in shells when we include a quadratic confining potential ; and we also obtain in - trap density distributions that shows plateaux as in the single - species case . in the case of the spin-1 bose - hubbard model",
    "we show , in a representative case , that the system can display alternating shells of polar sf  @xcite and mi phases ; the latter have integral values for the boson density .",
    "our inhomogeneous mean - field theory leads to interesting predictions for atomic - clock - shift experiments in systems with spin-1 bosons in an optical lattice with a confining potential .    the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the models we use and how we develop an inhomogeneous mean - field theory for them .",
    "section 3 is devoted to our results ; subsection 3a contains the results of our inhomogeneous mean - field theory for the single - species , spinless bose - hubbard model ; subsection 3b is devoted to the results , for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases , for the spinless bh model with two types of bosons ; subsection 3c is devoted to our results for the single - species bh model for spin-1 bosons .",
    "section 4 contains our conclusions , a comparison of our work with earlier studies in this area , and the experimental implications of our results .",
    "we begin by defining the three bose - hubbard models that we study .",
    "we then develop inhomogeneous mean - field theories that are well suited for studying the spatial organization of phases in these models with confining potentials .",

    "we set the scale of energies by using @xmath36 in the bose - hubbard model  [ eq : bh0 ] ; for comparisons with experimental systems we should scale all energies by @xmath29 .    for a mixture with two types of bosons , we use the following bose - hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath37",

    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath45 , and , to set the scale of energy , we use @xmath46 .",
    "the third and fourth terms account for the onsite interactions of bosons of a given type , with energies @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , whereas the fifth term , with energy @xmath49 , arises because of the onsite interactions between bosons of types @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "the model  ( [ eq : bhspin1 ] ) includes , in addition to the onsite repulsion @xmath68 , an energy @xmath69 for nonzero spin configurations on a site .",
