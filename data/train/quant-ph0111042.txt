    "the preparation of ultracold ions as well as the production of nonclassical motional states of these ions plays a central role in ion trap experiments@xmath0}$ ] . as the trapped ion system is in nearly perfect isolation , immune from the violation of the environment , and meanwhile the electric - dipole forbidden transition is usually introduced for avoiding the dissipation of the ion , the decoherence in the preparation and preservation of nonclassical states can be effectively suppressed .",
    "consequently , the ion trap system is also being considered to be a promising tool for the quantum computing@xmath1}$ ] .",
    "the various theoretical schemes for generating the nonclassical states of motion of the trapped ions and achieving quantum computing with trapped ions are based on the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model@xmath2}$ ] , in which the ion is simplified to be of two levels , the trap s potential is quantized as a harmonic oscillator , and the radiating lasers are supposed to be classical forms of standing or travelling waves . the general consideration is taken for the case of lamb - dicke limit ( ldl ) under the weak excitation regime ( wer ) , which corresponds to the actual case in present ion trap experiments@xmath3}$ ] .",
    "the ldl means the ions moving within the region of the space much smaller than the effective wavelength of the laser wave , and the wer means the laser - ion interaction much smaller than the trap frequency . for this case",
    ", some techniques developed in the framework of cavity qed based on jc model can be immediately transcribed to the ion trap system by taking advantage of the analogy between the cavity qed and ion trap problem . in the case of motion of ions exceeding the ldl , we can use the technique proposed in ref.[8 ] for a treatment . in a word , under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , the problem of trapped ions interacting with lasers is solvable .",
    "however , the strength of the coupling between the ions and lasers can be conveniently adjusted simply by changing the intensity of lasers . if the coupling strength is much larger than the trap frequency , called the strong excitation regime ( ser ) , then the rwa is no longer applicable since the rapidly oscillating ( i.e. , counter - rotating ) terms also make significant contribution in the interaction , which is much different from the case in cavity qed@xmath4}$ ] .",
    "it has been reported that the ser is useful for preparing nonclassical motional states of a trapped ion and implementing quantum computing with trapped ions@xmath5}$ ] .",
    "for example in ref.[10 ] , schrdinger cat states could be prepared readily in simple way in the ser . based on that work",
    ", a proposal was made for motional state engineering and endoscopy in the ser@xmath6}$ ] .",
    "as the quantum state is sensitive to decoherence , the manipulation of trapped ions in the ser is of importance to the experimental implementation and measurement because of the great reduction of the operation time . due to the same reason",
    ", a scheme for the hot - ion quantum computing also requires the condition of the ser@xmath7}$ ] .",
    "in contrast to the theoretical studies , the ion - laser interaction in the ser has not yet been reported experimentally since the high - laser intensity produces increased off - resonant excitation of carrier transitions which limits the final ground state occupation of the cooling process@xmath8}$ ] , and the strong laser also modifies the original electronic levels of the ions@xmath9}$ ] , making the problem somewhat complicated . in a numerical study of the strong raman sideband excitation driving the vibrational ground state of the trapped ion@xmath10}$ ] , it is shown that the non - rwa interaction terms produce some limitations for two strong laser beams detuned by the vibrational frequency to be used as raman motional displacement beams , whereas the interaction is useful for the preparation of the schrdinger cat state .    generally speaking ,",
    "as the rwa is invalid , the ion trap problem in the ser can not be solved analytically with jc model .",
    "so some approximations have to be introduced in refs.[10,11 ] and the studies in refs.[12,15 ] are resorted to numerical calculations .",
    "in fact , as shown in ref.[16 ] , even if the ions are governed in the wer , in which the rwa is valid , the deletion of the rwa can also present some interesting results much different from those under the rwa . in that work ,",
    "some particular analytical solutions have been obtained in the absence of the rwa for large detuning cases , and schrdinger cat states could be readily prepared .",
    "however , that work is too simple .",
    "we hope to investigate the raman configuration which has been extensively applied in actual ion trap experiments@xmath3}$ ] , instead of the simple case in ref.[16 ] .",
    "we also hope to exclude the assumption related to both the wer and ldl .",
    "therefore , in this contribution , we will try to undertake a more general and complete investigation on the trapped ion under the raman process .",
    "moreover , a comparison of our results with those under the rwa will be made .",
    "besides , we will propose a scheme for preparing the schrdinger cat state beyond the wer .",
    "we study the single ultracold ion radiated by lasers in raman-@xmath11-type configuration , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the electronic structure is employed with two lower levels @xmath12 and @xmath13 coupled to a common upper state @xmath14 , and the two lasers with frequencies @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively are assumed to propagate along opposite directions . for a sufficiently large detuning to the level @xmath14 , @xmath14 may be adiabatically eliminated , and what we have to treat is an effective two - level system , in which the lasers drive the electric - dipole forbidden transition @xmath13@xmath17 .",
    "the dimensionless hamiltonian of such a system in the frame rotating with the effective laser frequency @xmath18@xmath19 can be written as@xmath20}$ ] @xmath21 where the detuning @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the optical resonance frequency , i.e. , the transition frequency of two levels of the ion , and @xmath24 the frequency of the trap .",
    "@xmath25 is the dimensionless rabi frequency and @xmath26 the effective lamb - dicke parameter given by @xmath27 with subscripts denoting the counterpropagating laser fields .",
    "@xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are pauli operators , @xmath30 is the dimensionless position operator of the ion with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being operators of creation and annihilation of the phonon field , respectively .",
    "the notations + and - in front of @xmath33 indicate the absorption of a photon from one beam followed by emission into the other beam and vice versa , respectively .",
    "@xmath24 is generally supposed to be much greater than the atomic decay rate , called the strong confinement limit , for neglecting the effect of the atomic decay . in general",
    ", one may expand @xmath34 in eq.(1 ) to the first - order terms of @xmath35 and neglect other higher - order terms by supposing the ion governed under the wer ( @xmath36 ) and within the ldl ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "however , as we hope to treat the problem more exactly and generally , we first perform following unitary transformations on eq.(1 ) , that is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . actually , the unitary transformation @xmath44 made above is identical to that in [ 17 ] .",
    "but for coinciding with the standard form of non - rwa model , @xmath45 is performed .",
    "comparing with the standard non - rwa jc model@xmath4}$ ] , there exist an additional driven term and an additional constant term in eq.(2 ) , and the optical resonance frequency is replaced by the rabi frequency . in what follows , we will adopt the coherent state representation@xmath46}$ ] , by which the non - rwa jc models have been analytically treated@xmath47}$ ] . thus eq.(2 )",
    "is rewritten as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a complex number , and @xmath50 with the relation between the coherent state and fock state @xmath51 using the same idea as in refs.[16,19 ] , we assume the eigenfunction of the schrdinger equation of eq.(3 ) to be the series form @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants determined later . taking @xmath56 into the schrdinger equation of eq.(3 ) will yield two recurrence relations @xmath57,\\ ] ] @xmath58\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the trial solution of the eigenenergy of eq.(3 ) . as the procedure of solution is similar to that in ref.[16 ] , in what follows , we just list the results :    \\(1 ) @xmath60 for @xmath61 , we have two solutions .",
    "one is @xmath62 with @xmath63 the eigenenergy of the system in this case , corresponding to @xmath64 and a restricted relation of @xmath65 .",
    "the other is @xmath66 , with @xmath67 and a restricted relation of @xmath68 .",
    "the eigenfunctions for above two cases are respectively @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 can be set to be 1 for normalisation .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath60 for @xmath77 , the two solutions are @xmath78 corresponding to @xmath79 and two independent restricted conditions , which can be solved from the following equation , respectively @xmath80 @xmath81}\\ ] ] the eigenfunctions at this moment in the unit of @xmath82 are , respectively , @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 $ ] , @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88c_{0 } \\}$ ] , @xmath89 , @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 $ ] , and @xmath92c^{'}_{0 } \\}$ ] ;    \\(3 ) when above technique is extended to the case of @xmath60 for @xmath93 , the series solution becomes very complicated .",
    "however the eigenenergy of the system is still of the simple form , that is , @xmath94 , corresponding to @xmath79 and two independent sets of much complicated expressions of restricted conditions which we have to omit here , respectively .",
    "as limitations for both the rabi frequency and lamb - dicke parameter as well as the rwa are excluded in the present treatment , the results we obtained above are more exact and general than those depending on the rwa or the approximate expansion of small values of @xmath26 and @xmath25 . however , as the problem involving the counter - rotating terms is non - integrable@xmath95}$ ] , the present solutions obtained by the termination of the series of the trial solution @xmath56 are some particular ones , along with some restricted conditions related to some parameters of the system . nevertheless , with the present solutions",
    ", we can investigate some cases in a wide range of parameters , particularly for the case beyond the wer and ldl .",
    "it is also of interest to make a comparison of our results with those under the rwa .",
    "let us first consider a special case with both @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "in such a case , eq.(3 ) is reduced to @xmath98 repeating the above procedure of the series solution for the simplest case , i.e. , @xmath60 for @xmath61 , we can find @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we can easily find that the eigenenergy @xmath104 is in good agreement with the solution in a fock state representation for @xmath105 .",
    "however , to make a comparison for eigenfunctions with former solutions , we have to return to the original representation before eq.(2 ) .",
    "the eigenfunction in the original representation is @xmath106 @xmath107 where we have used the fact@xmath108}$ ] that @xmath109 in a coherent state representation corresponds to the displaced fock states @xmath110 by means of eq.(4 ) and baker - campbell - hausdorff formula .",
    "therefore , in the case of @xmath111 but @xmath112 , we have from eq.(8 ) @xmath113 or @xmath114 , which means no transitions existing in the large detuning case .",
    "if we assume @xmath115 and @xmath25 being arbitrary positive real number , we have @xmath116 , which corresponds to the carrier excitation .",
    "both solutions above are also in good agreement with the solutions in a fock state representation@xmath117}$ ] . however , from eq.(8 ) we can know that , different from former solutions for the wer case , the probability amplitudes of up and down states of the ion are different and complicated in the case of the ser with large detunings .",
    "this is a new result which has not been obtained before by general approaches made in a fock state or dressed state representation .    for a more general comparison",
    ", we should first present the solutions under the rwa .",
    "as referred to in sec.i , eq.(1 ) can be treated to be a nonlinear jc model with the approach proposed in ref.[8 ] under the rwa .",
    "however , to make the comparison more easy and clear , we start our rwa treatment from eq.(2 ) . by performing a unitary transformation",
    "@xmath118 $ ] on eq.(2 ) with @xmath119 , we can obtain @xmath120 corresponding to the resonance conditions of @xmath121 under the rwa , and the eigenenergy in a fock state representation is of the form @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "meanwhile , performing a unitary transformation of @xmath124 $ ] on eq.(2 ) with @xmath125 , under the rwa resonance conditions of @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 whose eigenenergy in a fock state representation is of the form @xmath128 with @xmath123 .    as shown in the last section ,",
    "although our method can in principle present all series solutions , we merely present the specific forms of the non - rwa solution for two simplest cases . here",
    "we will use those two cases for a comparison with eqs.(10 ) and ( 12 ) . for the case",
    "( 1 ) , we find that the two solutions for @xmath129 , along with two different restricted relations respectively , actually correspond to the same expression @xmath130 however , for the case ( 2 ) , the situation is somewhat complicated .",
    "the direct algebra shown in appendix presents us four solutions of e for this case , whereas the specific calculation shows that the solutions of eqs.(a3 ) and ( a4 ) are actually identical .    in figs.2 and 3 ,",
    "the solutions under the rwa are compared with those for the non - rwa treatment in the case of @xmath1310.5 and 3.0 .",
    "we can find that , in the case of small values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , some of the solutions under the rwa can approach those without the rwa .",
    "it is physically reasonable because the rwa is only valid for the wer and ldl .",
    "however , although the solutions without the rwa are exact , only a few of these solutions can be obtained for a certain termination of the series solution .",
    "we can not obtain all the particular solutions of the system unless we make the termination of the series solution for almost infinite times up to the case with infinite series terms .",
    "in contrast , the rwa treatment can present general solutions , like eqs.(10 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as it merely retains some resonance terms in the hamiltonian , a specific solution under the rwa only corresponds to a specific value of @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , the figures tell us that , only when the value of @xmath26 is not taken to be larger than 0.1 , can we consider that the solutions under the rwa and without the rwa are in good agreement in the case of the wer .",
    "the rwa description is obviously inaccurate for the case beyond the ldl although @xmath25 is less than 1.0 in this case . when the value of @xmath25 is larger , the difference between the rwa case and non - rwa one becomes great , as shown in figs.3 .",
    "it is difficult to find any correspondence for the two cases .",
    "however , there are some crossing points between the rwa solutions and non - rwa ones .",
    "it means at certain values of @xmath26 , the solutions for eigenenergies in these two cases can be the same . in physics",
    ", it can be considered that the non - rwa solutions are some isolated ones , merely corresponding to those of up internal levels of the ion .",
    "one may not expect to obtain the general eigenenergies with our non - rwa treatment .",
    "however , the demonstration of above series solutions means the existence of the finite dimensional invariant subspace of some operators . particularly from the simple forms of the eigenenergies",
    ", one may expect that the quantum kam theorem should be applicable for the ser problem@xmath132}$ ] .    before ending our discussion of the usefulness of non - rwa solutions ,",
    "it is also of interest to present a practical example of preparing the nonclassical motional states of the ion with our solutions . as referred to in sec.i",
    ", there is a considerable interest in investigating the ser , particularly for rapidly preparing nonclassical motional states of the ion .",
    "in fact , with the results in the present paper , one can also generate some particular nonclassical states through suitable adjustment of the rabi frequencies and proper measurements .",
    "for example , consider the simplest case , i.e. , the case ( 1 ) in sec ii .",
    "for the case of the resonance ( @xmath133 ) , we have @xmath134 with the same @xmath25 and double degenerate eigenfunctions @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "transforming our results into the schrdinger representation will yield the states @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively . in the case of the ldl(@xmath139 ) , the rabi frequency @xmath25 would be @xmath140 .",
    "so we have @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . by controlling the evolution time @xmath145 , and measuring the excited state of the ion",
    ", we can obtain a displaced even coherent state , a kind of schrdinger - cat states @xmath146 where the relation between the coherent state and fock state has been used . as the rabi frequency approaches 2 ,",
    "such a preparation is obviously outside the wer .",
    "as @xmath109 corresponds to the displaced fock states @xmath110 , the eigenfunctions of the system we obtained are infinite superposition of displaced fock states .",
    "therefore , it is understandable that we can not obtain similar analytical results by general fock state expansion .",
    "the obvious advantage of our approach is the possibility to obtain some relations between parameters of the system corresponding to certain nonclassical states by truncating the series expansion step by step .",
    "so as long as we can reach these conditions experimentally , the different nonclassical states predicted by our theory would be obtained .    in summary",
    ", the raman interaction between a trapped ultracold ion and two travelling wave lasers has been treated analytically in an interaction representation , without consideration of the rwa and the limitation for both the ldl and wer .",
    "although the coherent state expansion technique was used previously for treating a similar problem , and the solutions we presented here are some isolated ones under certain conditions related to @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath147 , the present investigation is more general and exact so that we can study the ion trap problem in a wide range of parameters and compare our results with other approximate works or numerical solutions in this respect as we did in the present paper and for the cavity - atom problem@xmath148}$ ] .",
    "more importantly , the raman process has been widely used for the laser - cooling in current ion trap experiments , and the work outside the wer is attracting much interest of experimentalists .",
    "one possible way@xmath20}$ ] to experimentally realizing the ser is that the ion is first cooled within the ldl and under the wer , and then the trap frequency is decreased by opening the trap adiabatically so that the ratio of the rabi frequency to the trap frequency is increased to a large number . therefore , we believe that the difficulties in realizing the ser will soon be overcome , and our work would be helpful for any possible future exploration of the quantum properties of the ion - trap system outside the wer .",
    "the author sincerely thanks m.a.kornberg for his carefully reading the manuscript . the work is partly supported by national natural science foundation of china .",
    "for obtaining a more specific expression of the eigenenergy for the case ( 2 ) in sec.ii , we can suppose @xmath149 for the case of @xmath150 and @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "direct algebra on eq.(7 ) can present us following two second - order differential equations @xmath153 and @xmath154 with @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 $ ] .",
    "so we can obtain the eigenenergies @xmath158 for the case of @xmath150 and @xmath159 for the case of @xmath152 .",
