    "2 ) . if @xmath221 , the system dynamics additionally depends on the values of @xmath69 and @xmath197 . it may furthermore depend on the initial condition , if @xmath33 and @xmath39 ( see figs .",
    "3 + 4 ) .     and/or",
    "@xmath69 are varied and interaction between populations as well as self - interactions are considered .",
    "the representation and grey shades ( colors ) are the same as in fig .",
    "3 . , width=340 ]    while our previous analysis has been formal and abstract , we will now discuss our results in the context of social systems for the sake of illustration .",
    "then , the entities are _ individuals _ , and the states represent _ behaviors_. without loss of generality , we assume @xmath222 ( determining the numbering and meaning of behaviors ) and @xmath198 ( determining the numbering of populations such that the power of population 1 is the same or greater than the one of population 2 ) .",
    "moreover , we will use the following terminology : if two interacting individuals show the _ same _ behavior , we will talk about _ `` coordinated behavior''_. the term _ `` preferred behavior '' _ is used for the preferred _ coordinated _ behavior , i.e. the behavior which gives the higher payoff , when the interaction partner shows the _ same _ behavior .",
    "this payoff is represented by @xmath223 , while the non - preferred coordinated behavior results in the payoff @xmath224 .",
    "furthermore , if a focal individual chooses its preferred behavior and the interaction partner chooses a different behavior , the first one receives the payoff @xmath225 and the second one the payoff @xmath226 . in the so - called prisoner s dilemma , @xmath223 usually stands for `` reward '' , @xmath226 for `` temptation '' , @xmath224 for `` punishment '' , and @xmath225 for `` sucker s payoff '' .",
    "the payoff - dependent parameter @xmath227 may be interpreted as gain of coordinating on one s own preferred behavior ( if greater than zero , otherwise as loss ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath228 may be interpreted as gain when giving up coordinated , but non - preferred behavior .    the conflict of interest between two populations",
    "is reflected by the fact that _ `` cooperative behavior '' _ is a matter of perspective : a behavior that appears cooperative to a focal individual is cooperative from the viewpoint of its interaction partner only , if belonging to the same population , otherwise it is non - cooperative from the interaction partner s viewpoint . in the model studied in this paper , population 1 prefers behavior 1 , population 2 behavior 2 .",
    "moreover , behavior 1 corresponds to the cooperative behavior from the viewpoint of population 1 , but to the _ non - preferred _ behavior of the interaction partner , i.e. it is _ non - cooperative _ from the point of view of population 2 .",
    "moreover , if two interacting individuals display the _ same _ behavior , their behavior is coordinated .",
    "finally , we speak of a _ `` behavioral norm '' _ or of _ `` normative behavior '' , _ if all individuals ( or the great majority ) show the same ( coordinated ) behavior @xcite , independently of their behavioral preferences and the ( sub-)population they belong to .",
    "it should be stressed that this requires the individuals belonging to one of the populations to act against their own preferences .",
    "@xcite for the related social science literature .    within the context of the above definition ,",
    "the four types of system dynamics distinguished above are related to four types of games discussed in the following :    1 .",
    "for @xmath229 we have a _ multi - population prisoner s dilemma ( mpd ) _ , which corresponds to the case @xmath33 and @xmath34 . according to the results in sec .",
    "[ main ] , this is characterized by a breakdown of cooperation .",
    "accordingly , individuals in both populations will end up with their non - preferred behavior .",
    "this is even true , when the non - negative parameter @xmath84 in the generalized replicator equations ( [ gen1 ] ) and ( [ gen2 ] ) is different from 1 . 2 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath230 we have a _ multi - population harmony game ( mhg ) _ with @xmath36 and @xmath39 . in this case , all individuals end up with their preferred behaviors , but the behavior of both populations is not coordinated . considering this coexistence of different behaviors , one could say that each population forms its own `` subculture '' .",
    "3 .   for @xmath231 , which implies @xmath33 and @xmath39",
    ", we are confronted with a _ multi - population stag - hunt game ( msh)_. for most initial conditions , the system ends up in the stationary states ( 1,0 ) or ( 0,1 ) . in the first case ,",
    "both populations coordinate themselves on the behavior preferred by population 1 , while in the second case , they coordinate themselves on the behavior preferred by population 2 . in both cases , all",
    "individuals end up with the same behavior .",
    "in other words , they establish a commonly shared behavior ( a `` social norm '' ) . however , there are also conditions under which _ different _ behaviors coexist , namely if ( 1,1 ) or ( 0,0 ) is a stable stationary point ( see yellow and red basins of attraction in fig . 4 and in the msh section of fig .",
    "3 ) . under such conditions , norms are _ not _ self - enforcing , as a commonly shared behavior may not establish .",
    "this relevant case can occur only , if both populations have interactions _ and _ self - interactions .",
    "it should also be noted that norms have a similar function in social systems that forces have in physics .",
    "they guide human interactions in subtle ways , creating a self - organization of social order .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of these issues .",
    "if @xmath232 , corresponding to @xmath36 and @xmath34 , we face a _ multi - population snowdrift game ( msd)_. in this case , it can happen that individuals in one of the populations ( the stronger one ) do not coordinate among each other . while some of their individuals show a cooperative behavior , the others are non - cooperative .",
    "we consider this fragmentation phenomenon as a simple description of social polarization or conflict .",
    "note that , in the multi - population snowdrift game with @xmath36 and @xmath34 , the stationary point @xmath159 exists for @xmath233 , and the point @xmath164 for @xmath234 . if @xmath235 and @xmath200 , @xmath159 is a stable fix point for @xmath236 , while @xmath164 is a stable fix point for @xmath237 , which implies a discontinuous transition at the `` critical '' point @xmath238 , when @xmath179 is continuously changed from values smaller than @xmath178 to values greater than @xmath178 or vice versa .",
    "this transition , where all individuals in the weaker population suddenly turn from cooperative behavior from the perspective of the stronger population to their own preferred behavior , may be considered to reflect a `` revolution '' . in the history of mankind",
    ", such revolutionary transitions have occured many times @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be insightful to determine the _ average _ fraction of cooperative individuals in _ both _ populations from the perspective of the stronger population 1 .",
    "when @xmath159 is the stable stationary point , it can be determined as the fraction of cooperative individuals in population 1 times the relative size @xmath69 of population 1 , plus the fraction @xmath239 of non - cooperative individuals in population 2 ( who are cooperative from the point of view of population 1 ) , weighted by its relative size @xmath240 : @xmath241 similarly , if @xmath164 is the stable stationary point , the fraction of cooperative individuals from the point of view of the stronger population 1 is given by @xmath242 as for @xmath243 , everybody in population 2 behaves non - cooperatively from the perspective of population 1 .",
    "surprisingly , the average fraction of cooperative individuals in both populations from the point of view of the stronger population corresponds exactly to the fraction @xmath37 of cooperative individuals expected in the one - population snowdrift game @xcite .",
    "however , this comes with an enormous deviation of the fraction @xmath68 of cooperative individuals in the _ weaker _ population 2 from the expected value @xmath244 ( as we either have @xmath245 or @xmath246 ) , and also with _ some _ degree of deviation of @xmath67 from @xmath244 in the stronger population 1 .",
    "that is , although the stronger population in the multi - population snowdrift game causes an opposition of the weaker population and a polarization of society @xcite , the resulting distribution of behaviors in both populations finally reaches a result , which fits the expectation of the stronger population  1 ( namely of having a fraction @xmath244 of cooperative individuals from the point of view of population  1 ) .",
    "one could therefore say that the stronger population controls the behavior of the weaker population .",
    "in this paper , we have used multi - population replicator equations to describe populations with conflicting interactions and different power .",
    "it turns out that the system s behavior is much richer than in the one - population case or in the two - population case without self - interactions .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to distinguish four different types of games , characterized by a qualitatively different system dynamics : the harmony game , the prisoner s dilemma , the stag - hunt game and the snowdrift game . when applied to social systems , the latter three describe social dilemma situations .",
    "however , in the presence of multiple populations , we may not only have the dilemma that people may choose _ not _ to cooperate .",
    "their behaviors in different populations may also be _ un_coordinated .",
    "accordingly , the establishment of cooperation is only _",
    "one _ challenge in social systems , while the establishment of commonly shared behaviors ( `` social norms '' ) is another one .",
    "note that the evolution of social norms is highly relevant for the evolution of language and culture @xcite . according to our model",
    ", it is expected to occur for multi - population stag hunt interactions .",
    "interestingly , compared to the multi - population games _ without _ self - interactions , we have found several new subclasses , depending on the power @xmath69 of populations and the quotient @xmath197 of the payoff - dependent parameters @xmath173 and @xmath174 . the same is true for multi - population snowdrift games .",
    "considering the simplicity of the model , the possible system behaviors are surprisingly rich .",
    "besides the occurrence of phase transitions when @xmath173 and @xmath174 change their sign , we find additional transitions when @xmath221 and the quotient @xmath197 crosses the values of 1 , @xmath247 , or @xmath248 .",
    "we expect an even larger variety of system behaviors , if the model parameters are not chosen in a homogeneous way .",
    "for example , one could investigate cases in which both populations play _ different _ games .",
    "our model can also be extended to study cases of migration and group selection .",
    "this will be demonstrated in forthcoming publications .",
    "it will also be interesting to compare the behavior of test persons in game - theoretical lab experiments @xcite with predictions of our model for interacting individuals with conflicting interests .",
    "depending on the specification of the interaction payoffs , it should be possible to find the following types of system behaviors : ( 1 ) the breakdown of cooperation , ( 2 ) the coexistence of different behaviors ( the establishment of `` subcultures '' ) , ( 3 ) the evolution of commonly shared behaviors ( `` norms '' ) , and ( 4 ) the occurence of social polarization . in the latter case , one should also be able to find a `` revolutionary transition '' as @xmath249 crosses the value of 1 . while there is empirical evidence that all these phenomena occur in real social systems , it will be interesting to test whether the above theory has also _ predictive _ power .",
