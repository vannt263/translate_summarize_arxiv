    "arguments have been put forward that we live in a spatially flat low matter density universe which is currently undergoing a period of accelerating expansion .",
    "if the observational evidence upon which these claims are based are rainforced and strengthened by future experiments , the implications for cosmology will be incredible .",
    "it could then appear that the cosmological fluid is dominated by some sort of fantastic energy density , which has negative pressure and has just begun to play significant role today .",
    "recent years have witnessed the emergence of the idea of an accelerating universe . therefore , due to some observational results @xcite@xmath1@xcite it is now established that universe is accelerating .",
    "this signifies a remarkable shift in cosmological research from expanding universe to accelerated expanding universe .",
    "now , the problem lies in detecting an exotic type of unknown repulsive force , termed as dark energy .",
    "the detection of dark energy would be a new clue to an old puzzle : the gravitational effect of the zero - point energies of particles and fields .",
    "the total with other energies , that are close to homogeneous and nearly independent of time , acts as dark energy .",
    "the paramount characteristic of the dark energy is a constant or slightly changing energy density as the universe expands , but we do not know the nature of dark energy very well @xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "dark energy ( de ) has been conventionally characterized by the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath2 which is not necessarily constant .",
    "the simplest de candidate is the vacuum energy @xmath3 , which is mathematically equivalent to the cosmological constant @xmath4 .",
    "the other conventional alternatives , which can be described by minimally coupled scalar fields , are quintessence @xmath5 , phantom energy @xmath6 and quintom ( that can across from phantom region to quintessence region ) as evolved and have time dependent eos parameter .",
    "some other limits obtained from observational results coming from sn ia data @xcite and sn ia data collaborated with cmbr anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics @xcite are @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "however , it is not at all obligatory to use a constant value of @xmath0 . due to lack of observational evidence in making a distinction between constant and variable @xmath0 , usually the equation of state parameter",
    "is considered as a constant @xcite with phase wise value @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for vacuum fluid , dust fluid , radiation and stiff fluid dominated universe , respectively .",
    "but in general , @xmath0 is a function of time or redshift @xcite@xmath1@xcite .",
    "for instance , quintessence models involving scalar fields give rise to time dependent eos parameter @xmath0 @xcite@xmath1@xcite . also some literature is available on models with varying fields , such as cosmological model with variable equation of state parameter in kaluza - klein metric and wormholes @xcite . in recent years",
    "various form of time dependent @xmath0 have been used for variable @xmath13 models @xcite .",
    "recently ray et al @xcite , akarsu and kilinc @xcite and yadav et al @xcite have studied dark energy model with variable eos parameter .",
    "spatially homogeneous and anisotropic cosmological models play a significant role in description of the large scale behaviour of universe .",
    "bianchi type iii cosmological model in presence of dark energy have been studied in general relativity by numerous authors .",
    "lorentz @xcite has presented a model with dust and cosmological constant .",
    "chakraborty and chakraborty have given a bulk viscous cosmological model with variable @xmath14 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "singh et al @xcite have investigated a model with variable @xmath14 and @xmath13 in presence of perfect fluid by assuming a conservation law of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "recently , tiwari @xcite has studied a model in presence of perfect fluid and time dependent @xmath13 with constant deceleration parameter .",
    "bali and tinkar @xcite have investigated a model in the presence of bulk viscous borotropic fluid with variable @xmath14 and @xmath13 . unlike robertson - walkar metric",
    ", bianchi type iii can admit a dark energy that yields an anisotropic eos parameter according to their characteristics .",
    "the cosmological data from the large scale structure @xcite and type ia supernova @xcite observations - do not rule out the possibility of anisotropic dark energy either @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated the anisotropic de models with variable @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the metric and field equations are described .",
    "the solution of field equations are presented in section 3 and section 4 concludes the findings .",
    "we consider bianchi type iii metric in the form @xmath15 where a , b and c are the function of t only .",
    "+ the simplest generalisation of eos parameter of perfect fluid may be to determine the eos parameter separately on each spatial axis by preserving the diagonal form of the energy - momentum tensor in a consistent way with the considered metric .",
    "thus , the energy momentum tensor of fluid is taken as @xmath16\\ ] ] then , one may parametrize it as follows , @xmath17   = diag\\left[1 , -\\omega_{x } , -\\omega_{y } , -\\omega_{z}\\right]\\rho\\ ] ] @xmath18\\rho\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the energy density of fluid , ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the pressures and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the directional eos parameters along the x , y and z axes respectively .",
    "@xmath0 is the derivation - free eos parameter of the fluid .",
    "we have parametrized the deviation from isotropy by setting @xmath26 and then introducing skewness parameter @xmath27 and @xmath28 that are deviation from @xmath0 along y and z axis respectively .",
    "+ the einstein field equations , in gravitational units ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , are @xmath31 where the symbols have their usual meaning . + in a comoving co - ordinate system , einstein s field equation ( [ eq4 ] ) , for the anisotropic bianchi type iii metric ( [ eq1 ] ) , in case of ( [ eq3 ] ) , lead to the following system of equations @xmath32 @xmath33",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 here , the sub indices 4 in a , b , c and elsewhere denote differentiation with respect to t. + integrating equation ( [ eq9 ] ) , we obtain @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the positive constant of integration .",
    "we substitute the value of equation ( [ eq10 ] ) in equation ( [ eq7 ] ) and subtract the result from equation ( [ eq6 ] ) , we obtain that the skewness parameter on y - axis is null i.e. @xmath39 thus system of equations from ( [ eq5 ] ) - ( [ eq9 ] ) may be reduce to @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 now we have three linearly independent equations ( [ eq11 ] ) - ( [ eq13 ] ) and five unknown parameters @xmath43 . two additional constraint relating these parameters",
    "are required to obtain explicit solutions of the system .",
    "+ ( i ) the law of variation of hubble s parameter that yields a constant value of deceleration parameter . such type of relation have already been considered by berman @xcite for solving frw models .",
    "later on many authors ( singh et al @xcite and references therein ) have studied flat frw and bianchi type models by using the special law of hubble parameter that yields constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "+ ( ii ) we assume that the expansion @xmath44 in the model is proportional to the shear ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this condition leads to @xmath46 where n is proportionality constant .",
    "the motive behind assuming condition ( ii ) is explained with reference to throne @xmath47 @xcite , the observations of the velocity red - shift relation for extragalatic sources suggest that hubble expansion of the universe is isotropy today within @xmath48 percent ( kantowski and sachs @xcite ; kristian and sachs @xcite ) . to put more",
    "precisely , red - shift studies place the limit + @xmath49 on the ratio of shear @xmath45 to hubble constant h in the neighbourhood of our galaxy today .",
    "collin et al @xcite have pointed out that for spatially homgeneous metric , the normal congruence to the homogeneous expansion satisfies that the condition @xmath50 is contant .",
    "+ the average scale factor of bianchi type iii metric is given by @xmath51 we define , the generalised mean hubble s parameter @xmath52 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the directional hubble s parameter in the direction of x , y and z respectively .",
    "+ equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , may be reduces to @xmath57 since the line - element ( [ eq1 ] ) is completely characterized by hubble s parameter h. therefore , let us consider that mean hubble parameter h is related to average scale factor @xmath58 by following relation @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are constant .",
    "+ the deceleration parameter is defined as @xmath62 from equations ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) , we get @xmath63 @xmath64 using equations ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) , equation ( [ eq17 ] ) leads to @xmath65 the sign of @xmath66 indicates whether the model inflates or not .",
    "the positive sign of @xmath66 corresponds to standard decelerating model where as the negative sign of @xmath66 indicates inflation .",
    "however the current observations of sn ia and cmbr favour accelerating models i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "+ from equation ( [ eq19 ] ) , we obtain the law of average scale factor r as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the constant of integration . + from equation ( [ eq22 ] ) , for @xmath71",
    ", it is clear that the condition for expansion of universe is @xmath72 i.e. @xmath73 . therefore for expansion model of universe the deceleration parameter ( q ) should be greater than @xmath9 .",
    "equations ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) lead to @xmath75 equation ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) lead to @xmath76 from equations ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) , we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the constant of integration and @xmath79 ,   @xmath80 ,   @xmath81 ,   @xmath82 . +",

    ". the redshift dependence of @xmath0 can be linear like @xmath97 with @xmath98 @xcite or nonlinear as @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the sn ia data suggests that @xmath7 @xcite while the limit imposed on @xmath0 by a combination of sn ia data ( with cmb anisotropy ) and galaxy clustering statistics is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "so , if the present work is compared with experimental results mentioned above then , one can conclude that the limit of @xmath0 provided by equation ( [ eq32 ] ) may accommodated with the acceptable range of eos parameter .",
    "also we see that for @xmath100 , the @xmath0 vanishes .",
    "thus for this particular value of s , our model represents dusty universe .",
    "+    the variation of equation of state parameter @xmath101 with cosmic time ( t ) is clearly shown in fig .",

    "the earlier real matter later on converted to the dark energy dominated phase of universe . + in absence of any curvature , matter energy density ( @xmath102 ) and dark energy density ( @xmath103 ) are related by the equation @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 + thus equation ( [ eq34 ] ) , reduce to @xmath107 using equations ( [ eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) , in equation ( [ eq35 ] ) , the cosmological constant is obtained as @xmath108 measurements of redshift of ia supernova sn 1997 ff indicate the present acceleration of universe .",
