    "a particular class of experiments employs neutrons with energy lower than the neutron optical potential of typical materials , i.e.  in the order of up to @xmath2 nev .",
    "these so - called ultracold neutrons ( ucns ) can be emprisoned for many hundreds of seconds in well - designed `` neutron bottles '' . by virtue of the neutron magnetic moment of @xmath3 nev / t magnetic trapping",
    "is feasible too , and also the gravitational interaction with a potential difference of @xmath4 nev per meter rise can play its role in ucn storage and manipulation @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most prominent application of ucns is the search for a non - vanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron . finding a finite value or",
    "just improving current limits is a way of investigating new mechanisms of cp violation beyond the standard model s complex phase of the weak quark mixing ckm matrix , and the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe pospelov/2005 .",
    "latest experimental results were published in refs .",
    "similarly long standing are the experimental efforts to determine the neutron lifetime with high accuracy .",
    "its value enters the calculations of weak reaction rates in big - bang nucleo - synthesis and stellar fusion @xcite , and it is also crucial for deriving the weak axial - vector and vector coupling constants of the nucleon needed to calculate many important semi - leptonic cross sections .",
    "discrete energy levels of ucns in the earth s gravitational field were proposed by lushikov and frank in 1978 @xcite , and demonstrated experimentally in the past decade nesvizhevsky/2002,nesvizhevsky/2005,westphal/2007 .",
    "precise measurements of the energy levels , that are not equi - distant , offer an interesting tool for tests of various new scenarios of particle physics .",
    "the range of effects investigated is determined by the characteristic size , several tens of micrometers , with which the neutron wave functions are bound in one dimension .",
    "deviations from the newton s gravity law at small distances can for instance be interpreted as a signal of large extra dimensions at the sub - millimeter scale @xcite or as a hint for dark - energy `` chameleon '' fields @xcite . a recent development ,",
    "called gravity resonance spectroscopy ( grs ) , where transitions between levels are induced by vibrating the mirror , has paved a way towards sensitive tests of such scenarios @xcite ( note , however , a strong competition from atomic physics in the chameleon search @xcite ) . a competing , alternative",
    ", method will employ oscillating magnetic field gradients @xcite . the grs experiment described in ref .",
    "@xcite has already set stringent limits on chameleons .",
    "it has also constrained axion - like particles , improving the result of an analysis of the non - resonant gravity experiment described in ref .",
    "a method not relying on spatial quantum states of the neutron employs spin precession of trapped ucns close to a heavy mirror zimmer/2010a .",
    "the sensitivity of the grs experiment was almost as good as a first search of that latter type @xcite and recently much improved @xcite , still with potential for large further gains in sensitivity . for the gravity experiment too , a large gain is still to be expected , notably once an adaptation of ramsey s molecular beam technique of separated oscillatory fields to grs is implemented @xcite .",
    "in addition , a search for a non - zero neutron charge based on the latter technique has been proposed @xcite .",
    "all current experiments on gravitational quantum states of the neutron employ highly polished quartz mirrors .",
    "these are expensive , limited to sizes of several tens of centimeters , and they have to be horizontally levelled by some active means . in this respect , using a liquid surface as a mirror might initiate a qualitatively new approach . on one hand it may furnish a remedy to the aforementioned limitations . on the other hand , the interactions of neutrons prepared in gravity states with excitations or structural decorations of the liquid surface could enlarge the applications of these states to investigations of the surface physics .",
    "the present article provides a theoretical investigation of the possibility to store ucns in the lowest gravitational energy states on the liquid helium surface , by analysis of scattering by helium atoms in the gas phase and by various excitations in both the bulk and at the surface of the liquid helium . obviously , a long storage time constant is a necessary condition for conducting experiments using a mirror made of this quantum liquid .",
    "a separate section sketches some experimental concepts addressing issues arising in real studies employing those neutrons , notably population , trapping and detection .",
    "properties of neutrons on the liquid helium surface are , in several aspects , similar to those of electrons .",
    "the two - dimensional electron gas on a surface of dielectric media has for many decades been a wide subject of research ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the gravitational force in the neutron case , the electrons are attracted to the boundary by the electric image forces through which they become localized in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the surface of superfluid helium has no solid defects ( like impurities , dislocations , etc . ) and offers a unique opportunity to create an extremely pure 2d electron gas .",
    "the mobility of electrons in this gas usually exceeds more than thousand times that of electrons in 2d quantum wells in heterostructures .",
    "the system thus simulates a solid - state 2d quantum well without disorder .",
    "many fundamental properties of a 2d electron gas have been studied with the help of electrons on the surfaces of liquid helium .",
    "various electronic quantum objects can be experimentally realized on the liquid helium surface , such as quantum dots @xcite , 1d electron wires @xcite , quantum rings quantumring , and others .",
    "the electrons on the liquid helium surface may also serve for an experimental realization of a set of quantum bits with very long decoherence time @xcite .",
    "if neutrons can be made to rest in surface states in sufficient densities we can hope for comparable studies using neutrons rather than electrons , and possible new states of quantum matter .",

    "flow - through '' scheme of current experiments neutrons enter a mirror table with an absorbing ceiling from one side and are detected on the other side .",
    "this might also be technically feasible for the liquid mirror , where neutrons will then however have to enter and exit the lake through a thin , weakly absorbing foil with low ( or negative ) neutron optical potential .",
    "application of magnetic fields might offer more attractive , novel experimental possibilities which we sketch below .",
    "considering first a technique for state population , we note that one may employ a magnetic field gradient for deceleration of neutrons moving from above towards the horizontal mirror located at @xmath59 .",
    "neutrons with magnetic moment @xmath329 in a magnetic field with modulus @xmath330 have a potential energy of @xmath331 , with sign depending on the spin state with respect to the field direction .",
    "the upper ( lower ) sign refers to those neutrons which become repelled ( attracted ) by a positive gradient of magnetic field modulus .",

    "a magnetic field modulus @xmath332 , for instance with constant ( positive ) gradient @xmath333 overcompensates gravitation for the high - field seeking neutrons .",
    "those with vertical kinetic energy @xmath334 at height @xmath335 will thus have lost this energy entirely when arriving at the mirror .",
    "this situation is analog to a neutron rising in the earth s gravitational field to its apogee ( after which it will fall back down ) .",
    "if alternatively , one wants to deccelerate the low - field seeking neutrons , the gradient has to be inverted and hence the strongest field needs to be located at the surface . while the neutron is close to the lowest point of its trajectory , the magnetic field gradient nearby the mirror needs to be switched off .",
    "for limitation of the spatial region where the field needs to be provided , one may employ a vertical , straight neutron guide , ending above and close to the mirror .",
    "a circular absorber with a central hole for the neutron - feeding pipe and mounted with variable distance of some tens of @xmath336 above the lake may serve for preparation of low neutron quantum states as used in the first experiments @xcite .",
    "an obvious benefit of the magnetic population method is a possible neutron detection acceptance angle of the full @xmath337 . using a helium lake offers the additional advantage that the presumably nearly perfect mirror can be made much larger than the quartz mirrors employed in current experiments .",
    "compared with a flow - through experiment the sensitivity of the energy state determination may be drastically improved using lateral ucn trapping prior to detection , ideally for many hundreds of seconds .",
    "this might be possible using a magnetic fence , consisting of a multipolar magnetic field arrangement similar to the system described in ref .",
    "@xcite . for our purpose the multipole of high order has to be oriented such as to provide only field components within the plane defined by the helium surface , i.e. , with current - carrying rods parallel to the gravity field .",
    "this will keep low - field seeking neutrons away from the liquid meniscus at the container wall , thus keeping the vertical neutron state unaffected .",
    "note that , if one populates the lake with high - field seeking neutrons , their spin has to be flipped after arrival at the surface and prior to arrival in the region of strong multipolar field , which can be done , e.g. , using standard magnetic resonance techniques .",
    "detection can still be done through the side walls of the helium container , requiring switching - off of the magnetic fields ( or better a spin flip to turn the trapped low - field seeking neutrons into high - field seekers to accelerate them through gaps in the magnetic fence ) .",
    "alternatively , one may let them rise back to the entrance of the neutron guide by switching on again the magnetic field gradient used for lake population .",
    "next , we discuss a possible further improvement of the lake population technique , noting first that a vertical straight and specularly reflecting guide with constant cross section does not mix the vertical with the horizontal components of neutron velocity . as a result ,",
    "the closer a typical neutron approaches the mirror , the larger will be the number of reflections per length unit of the guide .",
    "even a small non - specularity in the reflection will then become an issue .",
    "in addition , a typical neutron from a typical ucn source will , after removal of its kinetic energy in the vertical direction , still have a typical final speed parallel to the surface of several meters per second .",
    "a lower neutron speed would however be beneficial for both the flow - through mode and for trapping .",
    "for the former it increases the time a neutron spends on the mirror , while for the latter a lower magnetic field strength is sufficient for lateral ucn confinement on the lake .",
    "a non - imaging neutron optical device proposed by hickerson and filippone offers an interesting remedy for the aforementioned deficiencies of a straight guide @xcite .",
    "they describe a compound parabolic concentrator ( cpc ) for neutrons rising from a lambertian horizontal disk source upwards against the gravitational field .",
    "its neutron - optical properties are based on the `` neutron fountain '' @xcite valid for constant force fields along the symmetry axis of a parabolic reflecting surface . using a constant magnetic field gradient that overcompensates the effect of gravitation",
    ", neutrons approaching the lake from above will experience a constant deceleration @xmath338 .",
    "we may thus apply the cpc inverted in space with the neutron source ( an aperture with radius @xmath339 ) located at height @xmath335 above the lake . according to the formulas given in ref .",
    "@xcite , neutrons starting there at time @xmath340 and with speed @xmath341 will , after a time @xmath342 ( where @xmath343 ) and with typically fewer than two reflections , arrive within a narrow band of heights @xmath344 above the horizontal mirror .",
    "the spread of total kinetic energy within the ensemble of ucn is then only @xmath345 and independent of @xmath341 .",
    "after switching off the field gradient , the neutrons close to the mirror will thus move with much reduced lateral velocities compared to the traditional beam method . hence , even without lateral trapping , state population via a cpc will lead to much increased interaction times with the mirror and a corresponding gain in accuracy of measurements .",
    "a cpc will be most beneficial at a pulsed ucn source , preferably in combination with a rebunching technique as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and hence works best in combination with a ucn trapping experiment .",
    "we note that the very low lateral neutron velocities allow for quite modest magnetic trapping fields , which makes it easy to provide large openings for neutron detection in the magnetic fence .",
