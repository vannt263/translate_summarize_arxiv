    "[ fig : k ] with the @xmath257-axis , gives the @xmath272 of the @xmath182 excitation .",
    "\\ii ) high temperature region @xmath273 : eq .",

    "however , we do not adopt this solution since it implies that the @xmath182 excitation is tachyonic .",
    "] therefore the system is realized in the ordered phase with @xmath277 .",
    "the noether current of @xmath278 , @xmath279 ( @xmath280 ) , is coupled to the nambu - goldstone mode irrespectively of the direction of the expectation value @xmath235 .",
    "the above results are summarized as follows .",
    "when @xmath281 , our @xmath115 model is in the disordered phase for all the boundary conditions @xmath125 .",
    "when @xmath282 , the models with @xmath189 in the range @xmath283 ( @xmath5 is the inverse function of @xmath105 ) are in the nambu - goldstone phase , while the models in the other range of boundary conditions are in the disordered phase .",
    "the range of the boundary conditions corresponding to the ordered phase increases as we increase the temperature @xmath260 . translating this result back to the original @xmath4 pgm in 3 + 1 dimensions obtained as the vanishing @xmath196 limit of yang - mills theory , the ko confinement condition is satisfied at low temperature @xmath281 , however it breaks down at high temperature @xmath282 due to the contribution of the twisted boundary condition sectors in the average ( [ eq : vevinpgm2 ] ) with @xmath284 .",
    "the green s function ( [ eq : limna ] ) develops a massless pole when @xmath282 .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "first , we should comment on the compatibility of our result ( i.e. , that the nambu - goldstone phase is realized when @xmath273 for the twisted sectors ) with coleman s theorem which forbids the nambu - goldstone bosons in two dimensions . the origin of the absence of the nambu - goldstone bosons is that the ( ordinary ) massless scalar propagator in 1 + 1 dimensions @xmath285 does not exist because of infrared divergence . in the present case of the @xmath115 model with a twisted boundary condition , the massless propagator in momentum space ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dab ] ) ) takes in the infrared @xmath286 the following form : @xmath287 where @xmath288 denotes the principal part .",
    "coleman s theorem is evaded since the fourier transform of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : d - ir ] ) does exist : @xmath289 where @xmath290 is the step function , @xmath291 . an intuitive reason why the deconfining transition occurs in our model is that the infrared singularity ( in the perturbative ordered phase ) which caused the disordered phase at zero temperature is weakened by the twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the effect of the boundary condition becomes stronger as we raise the temperature and hence triggers the transition to the ordered phase .",
    "our second comment is on the imaginary - time formalism . in this paper",
    "we have employed the real - time formalism of finite temperature field theory since our interest is in the ko confinement condition , which needs continuous four - momentum and can not be discussed in the imaginary - time formalism .",
    "forgetting this fact for the moment , let us consider what happens if we adopt the imaginary - time formalism defined by the straight vertical time contour @xmath75 $ ] ( cf .",
    "[ fig : c ] ) in the above analysis of the @xmath115 non - linear @xmath116-model . then , for the exactly periodic sector with @xmath227 we get the same conclusion that @xmath292 and @xmath293 for all @xmath164 . for the twisted boundary condition sector , however , we get a completely different result from the real - time formalism : the disordered phase with @xmath293 is realized for all @xmath164 .",
    "this is because in the imaginary - time formalism with a twisted boundary condition , @xmath182 has no zero - mode to develop an expectation value . in particular",
    ", expanding @xmath182 into modes , @xmath294 ( @xmath295 ) for the anti - periodic boundary condition sector ( @xmath228 ) , the large @xmath117 analysis shows that no modes @xmath296 can develop expectation values .",
    "the expectation value @xmath297 is a monotonically decreasing function of the temperature @xmath260 and becomes negative for @xmath282 .",
    "note that a negative @xmath297 is not a trouble in this case since the effective @xmath298 is given by @xmath299 , which is seen to be always positive .",
    "the discrepancy between real - time and imaginary - time formalisms in the case of twisted boundary conditions may seem strange , but it is not a problem since the twisted sector is not an ordinary statistical mechanics system .",
    "this discrepancy , however , is disappointing for an attempt to analyze the original chiral model by the monte carlo simulation since it is possible only in the imaginary - time formalism .",
    "in this paper , as a first step toward the understanding of the deconfining transition in yang - mills theory in the sense of the breakdown of the color confinement condition of kugo and ojima , we have studied the model obtained by taking the limit of vanishing gauge coupling constant .",
    "this model at zero temperature is known to satisfy the ko confinement condition . adopting a special gauge - fixing function ,",
    "the system in 3 + 1 dimensions in the real - time formalism is reduced to a `` sum '' of chiral models in 1 + 1 dimensions with various boundary conditions concerning the time contour . as a qualitative approximation to the @xmath4 chiral model we analyzed the equivalent @xmath115 non - linear @xmath116-model using the large-@xmath117 like analysis .",
    "we found that the @xmath115 model with a twisted boundary condition undergoes a transition to nambu - goldstone phase because the infrared singularity is softened by the boundary condition .",
    "this implies the breakdown of the ko confinement condition in the 3 + 1 dimensional model .",
    "the pure - gauge model we considered in this paper , namely the vanishing @xmath196 limit of the yang - mills theory , is physically trivial , and the transition we have found is not the singularity of the free energy for the 3 + 1 dimensional pure - gauge model .",
    "however , since the confinement mechanism of ko has an intimate relationship with the gauge field disorder in the direction of local gauge transformation @xcite , the breakdown of the ko confinement condition we observed should suggest the deconfining transition in the real yang - mills theory .",
