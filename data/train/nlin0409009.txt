    "a sequence of ( time evolving ) harmonic oscillators which interact only with their immediate neighbors is described by the discrete schrdinger equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance between the oscillators and @xmath4 is the lattice of points @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , @xmath6 and the equation describing the system is given by @xmath7 as @xmath8 , one obtains the continuous model . + for @xmath9 , the above equation becomes the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the latter is one of the prototypical differential - difference models that is both physically relevant and mathematically tractable .",
    "perhaps , the most direct implementation of this equation can be identified in one - dimensional arrays of coupled optical waveguides @xcite .",
    "these may be multi - core structures created in a slab of a semiconductor material ( such as algaas ) , or virtual ones , induced by a set of laser beams illuminating a photorefractive crystal .",
    "in this experimental implementation , there are about forty lattice sites ( guiding cores ) , and the localized , solitary wave structures that this model is well known to support @xcite may propagate over tens of diffraction lengths .",
    "photonic lattices @xcite have recently provided another application of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger class of models . in this case , the refractive index of a nonlinear medium changes periodically due to a grid of strong beams , while a weaker probe beam is used to monitor the localized waves .",
    "this has created a large volume of recent activity in the direction of understanding discrete solitons in such photonic lattices .    finally , besides its applications in nonlinear optics ,",
    "the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation is a relevant model for bose - einstein condensates trapped in strong optical lattices ( formed by the interference patterns of laser beams ) @xcite . in this context",
    ", the model can be derived systematically by using the wannier function expansions of @xcite .",
    "these applications render the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation a particularly relevant dynamical lattice for a variety of physical applications .",
    "another example of a differential - difference equation that arises in many physical contexts consists of the nonlinear klein - gordon models .",
    "perhaps the simplest possible implementation of such a lattice arises for an array of coupled torsion pendula under the effect of gravity @xcite",
    ". however , such models are also relevant in condensed matter physics ( e.g. , describing the fluxon dynamics in arrays of superconducting josephson - junctions ) @xcite , as well as biophysics ( e.g. , describing the local denaturation of the dna double strand @xcite ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that nonlinear klein - gordon models are intimately related to their schrdinger siblings since the latter are the natural envelope wave reduction of the former @xcite .",
    "the klein - gordon model is of the form @xmath10 where we take @xmath11 and the nonlinearity will in general be assumed to be of the form @xmath12 . in this work ,",
    "we examine such schrdinger and klein - gordon models as follows : in section 2 , we give a priori energy and decay estimates for the free propagation in these lattices , which we subsequently prove by means of strichartz estimates in section 3 . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we use these estimates to examine solutions in the presence of nonlinearity for the schrdinger and klein - gordon cases respectively . as an application",
