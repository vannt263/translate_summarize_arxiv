    "interference alignment was first considered in @xcite as a coding technique for the two - user multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) x channel , where it was shown to achieve multiplexing gains strictly higher than that of the embedded mimo interference channel ( ic ) , multiple - access channel ( mac ) , and broadcast channel ( bc ) taken separately .",
    "while requiring perfect channel knowledge , this coding technique is based only on linear precoding at the transmitters and zero - forcing at the receivers .",
    "the degrees of freedom region for the x channel was analyzed in @xcite for an arbitrary number of antennas per user .",
    "this transmission technique was later generalized to the @xmath2-user interference channel @xcite , where it was shown to achieve almost surely a sum - rate multiplexing gain of @xmath3 per time , frequency and antenna dimension . in comparison , independent operation of @xmath2",
    "_ isolated _ point - to - point links would incur a sum - rate multiplexing gain of @xmath2 per dimension .",
    "this indicates that interference alignment allows virtually interference - free communications at the cost of each user exploiting only half of the available degrees of freedom .",
    "thanks to the alignment of all interfering signals in the same subspace from the point of view of all receivers simultaneously , interference can be removed simply through zero - forcing filtering .    in @xcite , an explicit formulation of the precoding vectors achieving interference alignment",
    "is presented for single - antenna nodes with time - varying channels . in the multiple - antenna case ,",
    "no such closed - form solution is known , although achievability results on multiplexing gains are available . in @xcite , an inner bound and an outer bound on the total number of degrees of freedom for the mimo case",
    "are presented .",
    "achievability results on the total number of achievable degrees of freedom are also presented in @xcite .",
    "an iterative algorithm was introduced in @xcite to find numerically the precoding matrices achieving interference alignment .",
    "little results have been obtained regarding _ constant _ mimo interference channels .",
    "some results concerning the @xmath2=3 user case are presented in @xcite .",
    "+ the goal of this contribution is to give a constructive proof of the achievability of interference alignment in the @xmath2-user constant mimo interference channels , for certain dimensions of the channel matrices .",
    "the proof in section [ section_novel_alignment_method ] deals with the case where the number of transmit antennas equals the number of receive antennas @xmath4 , the number of transmitter - receiver pairs equals @xmath1 . for those channel dimensions ,",
    "if the channel coefficients are drawn independently from a continuous distribution , we show that one degree of freedom is achievable per user with probability 1 .",

    "this article is organized as follows : the system model , interference alignment , and the iterative algorithm are introduced in section [ section_sysmodel ] .",

    "section [ section_unfeasible_network_setting ] describes an interference channel setting where interference alignment is unfeasible and section [ section_conjecture ] gives further insights obtained by the proposed method .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the system model for arbitrary ( non - square ) channel dimensions , and introduce the concept of interference alignment .",
    "we consider a @xmath2-user mimo interference channel with transmitters equipped with @xmath5 antennas and receivers with @xmath6 antennas .",
    "the mimo channel is assumed to be frequency - flat and the channel coefficients are drawn independently from a continuous distribution .    we focus our attention on the @xmath7 receiver @xmath8 , which receives interference from other transmitters @xmath9 in addition to its intended signal . the discrete - time channel model at a given time instance is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a vector representing the signals from transmitter @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the precoding matrix at transmitter @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 matrices representing the mimo channels of the link between intended communication pairs and the interfering link between transmitter @xmath17 and unintended receiver @xmath12 , respectively , experienced by user @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath18 accounts for the thermal noise generated in the radio frequency front - end of the receiver and interference from sources other than the interfering transmitters .",
    "+ interference alignment ( ia ) is achieved with degrees of freedom @xmath19 ( each @xmath20 corresponds to the multiplexing gain achieved for a transmitter - receiver pair , i.e. @xmath20 streams per transmitter are spatially pre - coded at transmitter @xmath12 ) iff there exists @xmath21 truncated unitary matrices ( precoding matrices ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 truncated unitary matrices ( zero - forcing interference suppression matrices ) @xmath24 such that , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 an iterative algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* algorithm 1 ) , which is based on the minimization of an interference leakage metric ( zero leakage is equivalent to the system of equations in and ) , was introduced to find the precoding matrices and to verify the achievability of interference channel settings . at every iteration ,",
    "the algorithm from @xcite involves the computation of @xmath2 eigenvalue problems .",
    "furthermore , depending on the interference channel setting the convergence speed can vary significantly .",
    "nevertheless , the iterative algorithm provides numerical insights into the feasibility of ia for the @xmath2-user @xmath27 mimo interference channel with any ia multiplexing gains .",
    "if a solution to the system and is found , the received signal of user @xmath12 after interference suppression yields @xmath28 where we used the fact that the interference term in is perfectly suppressed , due to .",
    "note that the energy of the signal part that lies in the interference subspace is lost .",
    "however , this power loss does not matter in the context of the degrees of freedom analysis .",
    "in this section , we focus on the case where the number of transmit antennas equals the number of receive antenna ( @xmath0 ) and the number of transmitter - receiver pairs @xmath1 . furthermore , and conversely to the achievability schemes of @xcite where only the total number of degrees of freedom is considered , we assume that each user gets one interference - free degree of freedom , i.e. , @xmath29 . throughout the paper , if @xmath29 , we will denote the @xmath30 s as the @xmath31 unit norm precoding vectors @xmath32 and the @xmath33 s as the @xmath31 unit norm interference suppression vectors @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : systemmodelk3_2x2 ] depicts the ia solution for a @xmath35 mimo interference channel that incorporates three transmitter - receiver pairs .",
    "the precoding leads to the following situation in the @xmath36-dimensional receive signal space at receiver @xmath12 : the interference from transmitter @xmath17 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , aligns perfectly in a one - dimensional subspace .",
    "we observe that every transmitter has to sacrifice in the number of signal streams compared to the case where only a single transmitter - receiver pair is present , where @xmath39 streams could be transmitted over the eigenmodes of the mimo channel .    in the following ,",
    "we describe a novel alignment method that provides a solution to the ia conditions and by reformulating as an eigenvalue problem .",

    "is invariant under left multiplication with a matrix @xmath56 that shifts rows .",
    "thus , we get a nonzero block diagonal @xmath57 @xmath58 in @xmath59 , with the permutation matrix @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , since all channel matrices are of rank @xmath36 with probability 1 and if we assume that @xmath61 , we can pre - multiply the permuted matrix @xmath59 with the inverse of the block diagonal and define a matrix @xmath62 with the free parameter @xmath63 , which turns into the standard eigenvalue equation @xmath64 it is clear from - that any @xmath65 associated to a nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath66 fulfills , for any choice of the @xmath67 for which @xmath68 is not singular . that is , if we define @xmath69 with @xmath70 , it is sufficient to choose the @xmath71 s such that @xmath66 has at least one non - zero eigenvalue , to solve the interference alignment problem .",
    "note that due to the structure of @xmath66 ( depicted in eq .",

    "note that the above technique achieves a total of @xmath2 degrees of freedom over the @xmath2-user constant interference channel with @xmath75 matrices .",
    "while for @xmath76 some methods achieving more degrees of freedom are known @xcite , we are not aware of similar constructive results for the case @xmath77 .      in order to illustrate the proposed method",

    "clearly , the eigenvalue problem can be reformulated in terms of the characteristic equation as follows : @xmath83 interestingly , in the @xmath76 user @xmath35 mimo interference channel , we can further exploit the structure of @xmath66 and rewrite as @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 . here , we used the fact that @xmath87 and that the channel matrices are full rank with probability 1",

    "we proceed along a shortcut in our proposed method by introducing a `` loop equation '' deduced from .",
    "the interference suppression vectors @xmath88 define subspaces of codimension one in the two dimensional receive signal spaces .",
    "therefore , the space spanned by the interfering signals @xmath89 must be one dimensional , i.e. , the interference signals are collinear .",

    ", we can write @xmath91 thus , leads to a similar eigenvalue problem like .",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 are obtained from eqs . and , respectively .",
    "again , the full solution to eq . is found by normalizing the precoding vectors @xmath94 and @xmath92 , and by choosing the @xmath40 s in the orthogonal complement of the interference subspace , which is guaranteed to be of dimension at least 1 .",
    "note that for even @xmath36 , the result presented here for the three user interference channel matches that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix iv ) ( in terms of the achieved degrees of freedom and of the expressions of the precoding vectors ) , while for the case of odd @xmath36 , the solution proposed here does not require to consider channel extensions , conversely to ( * ? ? ? * appendix v ) .",

    "* theorems 1 and 3 ) available for the time - varying case do not apply here , since we consider the constant channel case , and it is therefore not possible to conclude a priori about the existence of a solution . we will now show that interference alignment with one degree of freedom per user is not achievable in this case .",
    "let us consider receiver @xmath12 .",
    "the interference suppression vectors @xmath88 define subspaces of codimension one in the two dimensional receive signal spaces .",
    "therefore , the space spanned by the interfering signals @xmath98 must be one dimensional , i.e. , here , the three interfering signals must be collinear at each receiver .",

    "no general condition for the achievability of interference alignment in constant mimo interference channels has been found so far . using the iterative algorithm from @xcite",
