    "superconductivity is characterized by two prominent properties@xcite : persistent currents in vanishing electric field and the meissner effect@xcite , which highlights the rapid decay of an applied magnetic field within bulk matter in a superconductor of type i or ii , provided the field is lower than the critical fields @xmath0 or @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "some insight into the meissner effect could be achieved thanks to london s",
    "assumption@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 stand for the magnetic permeability of vacuum , the persistent current , induced by the magnetic induction @xmath4 and london s length , respectively . eq.([lon ] ) , combined with newton and maxwell s equations , entails@xcite that the penetration depth of the magnetic field is equal to @xmath5 , inferred@xcite as @xmath6 where @xmath7 stand for the charge , effective mass and concentration of superconducting electrons .",
    "the first one to question the validity of eq.([lon ] ) was pippard@xcite who investigated the effect of impurities on the absorption of electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies in superconducting @xmath8 and favored a phenomenological interpretation , based on the anomalous skin effect@xcite .",
    "this has resulted in interesting but inconclusive debates , regarding the validity of eq.([lon ] ) :    * some authors@xcite have attempted to justify eq.([lon ] ) by a classical treatment , whereas another school claimed that the meissner effect stemmed from some unknown quantum effect@xcite , possibly related to the bcs theory@xcite and cooper pairs@xcite ; * when a superconducting material is cooled in a magnetic field @xmath9 , starting from its normal state , the latter is expelled@xcite from the bulk material , while crossing the critical temperature @xmath10 at which superconductivity sets in .",
    "this additional manifestation of the meissner effect has generated an inconclusive debate over the distinction between a real material superconductor and a fictitious perfect conductor@xcite .",
    "however , nowadays all measurements of microwave energy absorption , carried out in superconducting materials@xcite , are intended at assigning the skin depth@xcite , which describes the finite penetration of the electromagnetic field . as the skin depth is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 stand for the conductivity of superconducting electrons and the microwave frequency , it is widely accepted that all superconductors display a finite conductivity at @xmath13 , which however is consistent with the observation of persistent currents at vanishing electric field .",
    "meanwhile a recent work by hirsch@xcite deserves a special mention , because it seems to be the first one challenging the well - entrenched claim that the london - bcs theory@xcite accounts satisfactorily for the whole physics of the meissner effect .",
    "it also makes a prediction , to be validated hereafter , that electron charge might pile up at the outer edge of a superconducting sample , embedded in a magnetic field .",
    "the present work takes advantage of hirsch s study in order to work out a theory of the meissner effect , resorting solely to classical tools , and to assess the validity of eq.[lon ] .",
    "the outline is as follows : sections ii and iii deal with the meissner effect .",
    "the validity of london s assumption , expressed by in eq.[lon ] , is analyzed in section iv .",
    "the case of the field cooled superconductor is addressed in section v. an experiment , enabling one to assess the validity of this theoretical approach is detailed in section vi , and the hall effect is dealt with in section vii .",
    "the experimental measurement of @xmath5 is described in section viii .",
    "the conclusions are given in section ix .     and",

    "the material contains superconducting electrons of charge @xmath23 , effective mass @xmath24 and concentration @xmath25 .",
    "it is subjected to a time @xmath26 dependent electric field @xmath27 only during @xmath280,t_0[$ ] , which defines a transient regime @xmath29 and a permanent one @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath33 induces a current @xmath34 along the field direction , as given by newton s law @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively proportional to the driving force accelerating the conduction electrons and a generalized friction term , which does not vanish in a superconductor , only if @xmath38 .",
    "however the physical sense of @xmath39 in eq.([newt ] ) for superconductors may be quite different from that given by the drude model for a normal metal@xcite . to understand this difference and to account for the new @xmath39 , we shall next work out the equivalent of ohm s law for a superconductor , submitted to an electric field .",
    "the superconducting state , carrying no current , is assumed to comprise two subsets of equal concentration @xmath40 , moving in opposite directions with respective mass center velocity @xmath41 , which ensures @xmath42 , where @xmath43 refers to the average electron momentum .",
    "the driving field @xmath33 causes @xmath44 of electrons to be transferred from one subset to the other , so as to give rise to a finite current @xmath45 , where @xmath46 stands for the electron momentum variation .",
    "the generalized friction force is responsible for the reverse mechanism , whereby electrons are transferred from the majority subset of concentration @xmath47 back to the minority one ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "it ensues from flux quantization and josephson s effect@xcite that the elementary transfer process involves a pair rather than a single electron .",
    "hence if @xmath49 is defined as the transfer probability per unit time of one electron pair , the net electron transfer rate is equal to @xmath50 . by virtue of newton s law ,",
    "the resulting generalized friction term is equal to @xmath51 , which validates eq.([newt ] ) , and permits to retrieve from it the equivalent of ohm s law for the superconducting state as @xmath52 whenever the inertial term @xmath53 in eq.([newt ] ) is negligible .",

    "given that @xmath110 m , the inequality @xmath111 holds for any @xmath112 under typical experimental conditions @xmath113 mm , @xmath114 .",
    "using eq.([jr ] ) and @xmath115 to integrate eq.([max2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath116 where the sum is performed for @xmath86 and @xmath117 .",

    "it is important to note that unlike @xmath5 , the @xmath106 length depends on experimental conditions via @xmath121 and @xmath122 s , and is hence not an intrinsic property of a superconductor .",
    "eq.([lon ] ) was assumed@xcite , starting from the following version of newton s equation @xmath123 which is identical to eq.([newt ] ) in case @xmath124 . integrating both sides of eq.([newt1 ] ) from @xmath125 up to @xmath126 yields for for @xmath127",

    "it has thereby been shown that london s equation is valid in the limiting case @xmath134 , which entails moreover that the penetration depth @xmath135 is @xmath85 independent .",
    "however the measured@xcite skin depth @xmath136 , being indeed @xmath137 , as expected theoretically@xcite , confirms that @xmath39 is finite for @xmath138 .",

    "responsible for the meissner effect to occur in a superconductor , cooled inside a magnetic field . since no paramagnetic contribution has ever been observed in the superconducting state@xcite , it has been concluded that the latter is always in a macroscopic singlet spin state .",
    "consequently the only contribution to @xmath139 is of macroscopic origin and can thence be calculated using maxwell s equations .",
    "we begin with writing down the @xmath26-averaged density of kinetic energy @xmath141 associated with the current @xmath142 , flowing along the @xmath33 direction ( this latter induces in turn a magnetic field @xmath143 , parallel to the @xmath16 axis ) .",
    "the second maxwell equation simplifies into @xmath144 because the term @xmath145 in the third equation in eqs.([fou2 ] ) shows up negligible with respect to that @xmath146 for practical @xmath147 . as",

    "actually this identity reads in general @xmath155 , where @xmath156 represents the helmholz free energy@xcite ; however the property that a superconducting state carries no entropy@xcite entails that @xmath157 . equating this expression of @xmath158 with that inferred from eq.([k2 ] ) yields finally @xmath159 as expected , @xmath139 is found diamagnetic @xmath160 and @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath163 proceeds along the same lines , except for the second maxwell equation reading @xmath164 and @xmath106 showing up instead of @xmath136 , whence @xmath165 note that our definition of @xmath166 , where @xmath167 refer to local field and magnetization at @xmath15 , differs from the usual@xcite one @xmath168 with @xmath169 being external field and total magnetization .",
    "while the sample is in its normal state at @xmath170 , the applied magnetic field @xmath171 penetrates fully into bulk matter and induces a magnetic induction @xmath172 where @xmath173 designates the magnetic susceptibility of conduction electrons .",
    "it comprises@xcite the sum of a paramagnetic ( pauli ) component and a diamagnetic ( landau ) one and @xmath174 in general .",
    "moreover the magnetic induction reads for @xmath175 @xmath176 with @xmath177 . because of @xmath178 , the magnetic induction undergoes a finite step while crossing @xmath179 @xmath180 where @xmath181 refers to the time needed in the experimental procedure for @xmath182 to cross @xmath179 . due to the first maxwell equation ( see eq.([bz ] ) ) , the finite @xmath183 induces an electric field @xmath33 such that @xmath184 , giving rise eventually to the persistent , @xmath171 screening current , typical of the meissner effect , as detailed hereabove .",
    "noteworthy is that , though @xmath171 remains _ unaltered _ during the cooling process , the magnetic induction @xmath4 is indeed _ modified _ at @xmath140 , as shown by eq.([dbt ] ) .",
    "this @xmath4 variation arouses the driving force , giving rise to the screening current @xmath14 , and ultimately to @xmath171 expulsion , in accordance with newton and maxwell s law , as shown by eq.([newt ] ) and eq.([max2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "an experiment , enabling one to check the validity of this work , will be presented now .",
    "it consists of inserting the superconducting sample into a cylindrical coil of radius @xmath21 , flown through by an oscillating current @xmath185 .",
    "the coil is made up of a wire of length @xmath186 and radius @xmath18 ( see fig.[bzr ] ) .",
    "applying ohm s law to the coil yields @xmath187 where @xmath188 are the applied and induced electric fields , both normal to the @xmath189 axes , the voltage drop throughout the coil and its resistance , respectively @xmath190 . besides @xmath191 is obtained from eq.([fou2 ] ) as @xmath192 where @xmath193 . working out @xmath194 in eq.([eth ] ) requires to solve the second maxwell equation for @xmath195 inside a cross - section of the coil wire @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are both assumed to be @xmath15-independent . moreover integrating eq.([coil ] ) for @xmath199 $ ] with the boundary condition @xmath200 ( see fig.[bzr ] ) , while taking advantage of eq.([ohm ] ) , yields @xmath201 combining eqs.([ohm],[eth],[bzt ] ) leads finally to @xmath202 inserting the measured value of @xmath203 into that equation and checking that it is fulfilled for any @xmath85 , would eventually ensure the validity of this analysis .",
    "in addition eq.([eth ] ) predicts that @xmath204 , where @xmath205 are the voltage drop amplitude , measured in the normal state , and the ratio of conductivities@xcite pertaining to the superconducting and normal state , respectively .",
    "as already noted by hirsch@xcite , during the transient regime @xmath206 , the magnetic induction @xmath57 exerts on the conduction electrons a radial lorentz force @xmath207 , pushing the electrons outward , so that a charge distribution builds up , which in turn gives rise , via poisson s law , to a radial electric field @xmath208 , typical of the hall effect .",
    "it is noticeable that this lorentz force arouses also a transient radial current but the latter , responsible for the charge distribution building up , vanishes in the permanent regime @xmath100 , and is thence irrelevant to the meissner effect .",
    "moreover for @xmath100 , equilibrium is secured by the radial centrifugal force @xmath209 , exerted on each electron making up the persistent current @xmath210 , being counterbalanced by the sum of the lorentz force and an electrostatic one @xmath211 , with @xmath212 given by @xmath213 owing to the second maxwell equation @xmath214 , @xmath212 can be recast as @xmath215 because of @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , the approximation @xmath219 can be used for significant @xmath220 . for the hall effect to be observed ,",
    "a sample in shape of a cylindrical crown of inner and outer radius @xmath221 , respectively , is needed ( see fig.[bzr ] ) .",
    "finally the hall voltage reads , for @xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224 ( @xmath225 is the static current flowing through the coil for @xmath226 ) is worked out by integrating eq.([max2 ] ) under the same conditions used to integrate eq.([coil ] ) . as in normal metals@xcite , measuring @xmath227 gives access to @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath227 is independent of @xmath228 .",
    "moreover poisson s law implies that a bulk charge density @xmath229 piles up , which reads @xmath230 this result validates hirsch s prediction@xcite .",
    "finally charge conservation requires a further superficial charge density @xmath231 to build up at @xmath21 all over the outer surface of the sample @xmath232",
    "most experiments@xcite have consisted of measuring complex impedances at frequencies @xmath233 $ ] , which is tantamount to assessing @xmath136 . because of @xmath108 in that frequency range , there is @xmath234 .",
    "however whereas @xmath54 can be measured by several methods , there is no experimental way to determine @xmath39 , so that the exact value of @xmath5 is not known and thence nor that of @xmath235 .",
    "therefore it is suggested to work at higher frequencies , such that @xmath236 , because @xmath237 is independent from @xmath39 in that range .",
    "typical values @xmath238 would imply to measure light absorption in the ir range . then for an incoming beam being shone at normal incidence on a superconductor of refractive index @xmath239 , the absorption and reflection coefficients @xmath240 read@xcite @xmath241 the refractive index @xmath242 and the complex dielectric constant @xmath243 , conveying the contribution of conduction electrons , are related@xcite by @xmath244 at last we get @xmath245 where @xmath246 refers to light velocity in vacuum .",
    "the same procedure could be applied in normal metals too ; however due to @xmath247 , the available frequency range would be much narrower : @xmath248 $ ] versus @xmath249 $ ] in a superconductor .",
    "this explanation of the meissner effect resorts solely to macroscopic arguments .",
    "the applied , time - dependent magnetic field excites transient eddy currents according to newton and maxwell s equations , which turn to persistent ones , after the magnetic field stops varying and the induced electric field thereby vanishes .",
    "those eddy currents thwart the magnetic field penetration .",
    "were the same experiment to be carried out in a normal metal , eddy currents would have built up the same way .",
    "however , once the electric field vanishes , they would have been destroyed quickly by joule dissipation and the magnetic field would have subsequently penetrated into bulk matter . as a matter of fact",
    ", the meissner effect shows up as a mere outcome of _ persistent currents _ , the very signature of superconductivity .",
    "it is thence unrelated to any microscopic property of the superconducting wave - function@xcite .",
    "the common physical significance of the meissner and skin effects , both stemming from @xmath250 for @xmath251 , has been unveiled too . a hall effect has been predicted .",
    "prediction@xcite , regarding an electron charge build up at the outer edge of a superconducting sample , has been confirmed quantitatively .",
