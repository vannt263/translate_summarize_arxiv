    "despite the spectacular success in developing , applying and even anticipating applications of quantum correlations , the study of multipartite entanglement remains an odd subject that often challenges our current understanding on the subject .",
    "while the structure of quantum states in the bipartite scenario is well understood and several measures of entanglement have been firmly established , the multipartite setting remains still quite unexplored @xcite .",
    "one very useful approach in the study of bipartite entanglement comes from the so - called best separable approximation ( bsa ) of a density matrix @xcite .",
    "the bsa approximation of any state @xmath1 acting on a bipartite system @xmath2 is its convex decomposition as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a separable density matrix , @xmath5 an entangled one and the weight @xmath6 of the separable part is maximal .",
    "the state @xmath4 is then called the bsa of @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to remark that although there exist many different decompositions of the form given above , the bsa is always unique , i.e. there exist a unique decomposition with maximal @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this uniqueness has been exploited to demonstrated important separability criteria in @xmath7 systems as well as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "further , it has been shown that when @xmath1 acts in @xmath9 , the bsa of any generic entangled state @xmath1 always leads to @xmath10 , that is , to a single projector into a pure entangled state @xcite .",
    "thus , for a qubit pair , the bsa provides trivially a measure of entanglement which can be expressed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 measures the entanglement of @xmath13 via the von neumann entropy of any of its subsystems .",
    "later on , a remarkable connection between the bsa and the concurrence @xmath14 was presented in @xcite namely , if @xmath1 has full rank ( i.e. rank 4 ) , then @xmath13 is maximally entangled , and the bsa measure coincides with that of the concurrence i.e. @xmath15 . in this case , the bsa generates a pure - state decomposition of @xmath1 that minimizes the average concurrence , since the decomposition consists of a single pure state with @xmath16 and weight @xmath17 , together with other states all having @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "more recently , a connection between the bsa and the max- relative entropy defined as @xmath19 , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 has been found @xcite .",
    "the max- relative entropy , @xmath22 , can be interpreted as the maximal probability in which a state @xmath4 appears in the convex decomposition of @xmath1 . clearly , maximizing over the set of separable states",
    "is by definition the _ separability _ @xmath6 of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "the max- relative entropy plays the role of a parent entropy for some relevant quantum relative entropies @xcite . +",
    "our aim here is to study if there exist a bsa in the multipartite case .",
    "that is , given a state @xmath1 acting on @xmath24 we inquire if there exist a unique decomposition @xmath25 with maximal @xmath6 . notice that generically , such a decomposition can not be determined due to the presence of entangled states that are positive under partial transposition ( ppt entangled)@xcite .",
    "here we focus on @xmath0-qubit symmetric states , whose separability conditions are less stringent due to the underlying symmetry . we demonstrate that in some cases it is possible to derive analitically the bsa for an arbitrary number of subsystems @xmath0 . + the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we",
    "first review the notion of best separable approximation to a given state . in section iii ,",
    "we introduce the subspace of symmetric n - qubit states , in particular the diagonal symmetric . in section iv , we prove constructively the existence of the bsa for n - qubit diagonal symmetric states assuming the state is full npt .",
    "we provide also the explicit expressions for the first non trivial case , namely @xmath26 . in section v we conclude and list the open questions .",
    "the bsa approach of a given state @xmath1 is based on subtracting maximally projectors onto product states contained on its range such that the remainder remains positively defined .",
    "formally that can be expressed as : given a bipartite quantum system @xmath1 acting in a hilbert space , @xmath27 of finite dimension , and a set @xmath28 of product vectors contained on its range , i.e. @xmath29 , there exists a separable state @xmath30 , called the optimal separable approximation ( osa ) of @xmath1 , and a decomposition @xmath31 , where @xmath5 does not contain any product vector on its range and @xmath32 , where the tilde over a density matrix means it is not normalized .",
    "if the set @xmath28 includes _ all product vectors _ in @xmath33 then @xmath4 is called the best separable approximation ( bsa ) of @xmath1 , and it is _ unique _ for every density matrix @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the conditions that a separable state @xmath4 has to fulfill in order to be the bsa of a given entangled state @xmath1 were given and proved in @xcite .",
    "they reduce to find the conditions for subtracting maximally ( i ) a projector @xmath34 onto a product state @xmath35 as well as ( ii ) a pair of projectors @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 onto product vectors @xmath38 , @xmath39 . for the easiness of our results we have included these maximality conditions in appendix [ app : appendixa ] of the manuscript .",
    "general @xmath0-qubit symmetric states @xmath1 are defined as states lying in a subspace @xmath40 of the hilbert space @xmath41 and fulfilling the relationship @xmath42 for any permutations @xmath43 over the @xmath0-element set , and where the operator @xmath44 is defined as @xmath45 , for @xmath46 @xcite . the normalized vectors that span @xmath40 are @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes @xmath49 .",

    "the elements of the basis , also known as dicke states , have many applications for quantum information processing @xcite . if we consider the partition with @xmath56 , it is straightforward to see that @xmath57 , and our multipartite symmetric state can be thought as a bipartite one . within this partition ,",
    "the elements of the basis can be rewritten as @xmath58 which using the substitution @xmath59 can be readily expressed as @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "+ in this paper we will focus on a particular subset of the symmetric states : the diagonal symmetric . let us denote by @xmath62 the projector space onto @xmath40 , which is spanned by @xmath63 , for @xmath61 . hence ,",

    "the characterization of entanglement in @xmath40 has been extensively addressed in recent years . despite substantial progress ( see @xcite and references therein ) full characterization of entanglement even in this simple case has still not been achieved .",
    "the difficulty arises from the existence of ppt entangled states that are shown to exist for all n - qubit symmetric spaces with @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "+ it is also known that if @xmath1 is ppt , supported on @xmath78 and has rank @xmath79 , then the state is separable @xcite . here",
    "we assume the generic case in which all probabilities @xmath80 , so that @xmath1 has full rank , i.e. @xmath81 . moreover , in order to ensure the state is entangled we impose that @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) is not definite positive . expressing @xmath1 in @xmath84",
    "the conditions under which it happens are given by a set of inequalities @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "+ the fulfillment of each of them imposes one negative eigenvalue for @xmath82 up to @xmath87 values , which is the maximum number of negative eigenvalues the partial transpose of a @xmath7 state can have @xcite .",

    "further we look for generic product vectors in the range of @xmath1 .",
