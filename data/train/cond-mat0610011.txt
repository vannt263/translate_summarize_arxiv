    "bec - bcs crossover is a field attracting lots of attention recently ajl1,nsl1,rand1,oh1,cross1 .",
    "the simplest systems to study the crossover are dilute fermion systems with attractive interactions , for which the effective range for two - body scattering is much less than the inter - particle spacing . at zero temperature ,",
    "such systems are characterized by a dimensionless number @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the two - body scattering length , and @xmath4 is the corresponding fermi momentum in non - interacting systems .",
    "for @xmath11 large and negative ( weak attraction ) one finds the bcs solution with pairing and superfluidity . with @xmath11 large and positive ,",
    "corresponding to strong attraction with a two - body bound state well below threshold , the bound pairs will bose - einstein condense ( bec ) .",
    "experimentally , @xmath11 can be changed between the bec and bcs limits at will using the technique of feshbach resonance ohara , jin , grimm , ketterle , thomas , salomon , thomas05 theoretically , physical quantities are expected to be a smooth function of @xmath11 , since there is no phase transition between the bec and bcs limits . in each of these limits",
    "the behavior is nonperturbative , however , the effective interaction is weak ; the system can be successfully described in a mean field approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "dilute fermion systems near the unitarity limit ( the @xmath12 limit ) require treatments beyond the mean field approximation such as numerical simulations qmc1,qmc2,jwk1,wingate",
    ", cr1,bdm1,lee .",
    "recently , nishida and son have proposed an analytical approach called @xmath0 expansion  to deal with problems near the unitarity limit @xcite . in this approach one",
    "computes physical quantities in @xmath13 spacial dimensions , then treats @xmath14 as a small expansion parameter , and then sets @xmath15 at the end to obtain the three dimensional physics .",
    "it is similar to the dimensional expansion method used by wilson to study critical exponents of second order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "nishida and son s idea was inspired by the observation of nussinov and nussinov @xcite that the ground state of a two - component fermion system in the unitarity limit is a free bose gas for @xmath16 ( also see refs .",
    "@xcite for simplification of certain diagrams with @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is because the two fermion bound state ( with zero binding energy ) wave function behaves as @xmath18 , where  @xmath19 is the separation between the two fermions .",
    "the probability integral @xmath20 has a singularity at @xmath21 when @xmath16 .",
    "thus the bound state has zero size and will not interact with each other .",
    "this feature was explicitly implemented in the theory set up near the unitarity limit in refs . @xcite .",
    "as we will see , away from the unitarity limit , one also expects the localization of the bound state wave function all the way to the bec limit but not to the bcs limit .",
    "now the @xmath0 expansion has been applied to few - body scattering rup1 , polarized fermions ( i.e. , with uneven chemical potential between two fermion species ) in the unitarity limit @xcite , and near the unitarity limit @xcite to identify the splitting point  in the phase diagram where three different phases meet  @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature in the unitarity limit has also been computed @xcite .",
    "recently , the first next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculation in the @xmath0 expansion was carried out for @xmath1 in the unitarity limit , where @xmath22 is the fermion chemical potential and @xmath23 is the fermi energy in non - interacting systems @xcite .",
    "contrary to the nice convergence seen previously at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , the nnlo of @xmath24 is as large as the leading order ( lo ) with an opposite sign .",
    "even so , it is still premature to claim that the large nnlo correction can not be tamed through reorganizing the series . thus , we consider it is still worth while to explore the @xmath0 expansion at lower orders .    in this work",
    ", we apply the @xmath0 expansion to nlo to study the bec - bcs transition with an arbitrary @xmath11 . in the bec side , an interesting relation between @xmath22 and the two fermion binding energy @xmath25",
    "is implemented : @xmath26this comes from the chemical equilibrium between two fermions ( with chemical potential @xmath27 ) and one boson ( with chemical potential @xmath28 ) in a 4-d system where the bosons do not interact with each other .",
    "we also perform the resummation of the @xmath29 terms arising from @xmath30 .",
    "these logarithms are formally higher order in @xmath0 but numerically important near the unitarity limit  ( @xmath15 , @xmath31 ) , and near the bec and bcs limits ( @xmath15 , @xmath32 ) . for example",
    ", this resummation gives the linear term in @xmath1 when @xmath31 : @xmath33without this resummation , physical quantities are always even in @xmath11 which would prevent us from reaching the bcs side .",
    "we are interested in a two - component fermi gas with zero range attractive interactions characterized by the scattering length @xmath3 . in nambu - gorkov formalism , the two - component fermions are denoted as @xmath35 .",
    "after the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , the lagrangian of the system is @xmath36where @xmath37 is the fermion mass , @xmath38 is the pauli matrix acting on the spin space , and the coupling @xmath39 depends on the two - body scattering length @xmath3 .",
    "the ground state is a superfluid state with a condensate @xmath40 , whose phase is chosen to be zero .",
    "@xmath41 is then expanded around @xmath42 , @xmath43the lagrangian will be further decomposed into perturbative and non - perturbative parts .",
