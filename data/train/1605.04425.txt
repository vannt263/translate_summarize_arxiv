    "since the theoretical explanation of the photoelectric effect  @xcite , quantum optics has developed into a main field of modern physics .",
    "a major focus is on the theoretical description of quantized radiation fields and the characterization of genuine quantum effects  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , quantum light is applied , for example , to perform secure communication protocols  @xcite .",
    "a fundamental feature of the quantum optical description of light is the representation in phase space .",
    "employing such a representation , a single - mode light field can be characterized and evolves formally in the same same way as a classical harmonic oscillator .",
    "such a semi - classical approach connects a quantum state , given by a density operator @xmath0 , with a corresponding phase - space distribution .",
    "prominent examples are the wigner distribution  @xcite , the husimi distribution  @xcite , and the glauber - sudarshan ( gs ) or @xmath1 distribution  @xcite , which yields a diagonal expansion in terms of coherent states @xmath2 : @xmath3    the gs distribution even defines the notion of nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "namely , for nonclassical states , it can not be interpreted in terms of a classical probability , which refers to as a quasiprobability distribution .",
    "such distributions can have negative contributions in two forms . if the gs distribution is regular , i.e. , a continuous function , the negativities",
    "can be directly observed : @xmath4 for some @xmath5 .",
    "if the @xmath1 distribution is singular , we have negativities in the sense of distributions , which will be studied in this work .    in general ,",
    "there exist a number of techniques to reconstruct phase - space distributions ; see  @xcite for reviews .",
    "however , the gs function is , in general , not accessible because of its singularities .",
    "therefore , some regularization methods have been proposed  @xcite . among others , the @xmath6-parametrized quasiprobabilities  @xcite",
    "have been mostly reconstructed in experiments . however , due to convolution , some of the nonclassical effects can not be detected with such phase - space functions ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "for example , the wigner function ( @xmath7 ) has the properties of a classical probability density for squeezed states and the husimi function ( @xmath8 ) is a classical probability distribution for any state . to overcome this deficiency , non - gaussian filter methods",
    "have been proposed  @xcite , which regularize the @xmath1  distribution for any state and exhibit negativities for any nonclassical state  @xcite . applying this approach in experiments",
    ", one can even directly uncover the nonclassicality of squeezed states  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above attempts to regularize the singularities of the gs distribution , one can alternatively study its fourier transform .",
    "this so - called characteristic function is regular for any state and it can be directly sampled in experiments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a hierarchy of necessary and sufficient nonclassicality conditions has been proposed on this basis  @xcite .",
    "similarly to nonclassicality tests in terms of moments , e.g. , in  @xcite , the characteristic function allows one a full characterization of the nonclassicality of a quantum state of light .",
    "recently , the moment - based and characteristic function nonclassicality conditions were even unified  @xcite .",
    "the gs distribution has been further generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite to capture time - dependent quantum effects .",
    "moreover , it inspired the introduction of optimized entanglement quasiprobabilities that are negative if and only if the a state is entangled  @xcite . in this context , it is also worth mentioning that an entangled state of light requires a nonclassical gs distribution .",
    "additionally , the regularization of single - mode quasiprobabilities has been extended to multipartite systems to verify quantum correlations beyond entanglement  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the singularities of the gs distribution are characterized . applying the technique of sudarshan",
    ", it is demonstrated that the representation of the @xmath1 distribution is not unique . using the characteristic function ,",
    "the singularities of the gs distribution are bounded and a maximally singular gs distribution is established .",
    "this exponential function of second - order derivatives of the dirac @xmath9 distribution is shown to present , in some sense , a strict bound to the irregularities for all quantum states of light .",
    "based on this finding , the regularization and the dual space of the gs distributions are considered .",
    "a number of examples are given .",
    "thus , these rigorous and analytical studies give a deeper insight into the gs quasiprobability and the related characterization of nonclassical states in optical systems .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",

    "a summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : snc ] .",
    "the question of nonclassicality has been completely solved for pure states  @xcite . the classical and pure states are exclusively coherent ones  @xcite , @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the displacement operator , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator , and @xmath14 denotes the vacuum state .    for mixed states ,",
    "the question of weather or not a system is classical is a more involved problem , due to the singularities of the gs distribution .",
    "an example of a nonclassical and singular gs distribution is @xmath15 which describes a single - photon state that is mixed ( @xmath16 ) with vacuum  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1 distribution is clearly highly singular due to the second - order derivative of the dirac @xmath9  distribution . for regular ( smooth ) gs functions",
    ", the nonclassicality can be directly visualized .",
    "for instance , the following @xmath1 distribution is negative for @xmath17 ( for any @xmath18 ) : @xmath19\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\alpha|^2}{\\bar n}\\right ) .",

    "these examples justify that a rigorous analysis of the singularities of the gs distributions is indispensable for a profound understanding of the nonclassical features of mixed quantum states of light .",
    "apart from those particular examples and to characterize the distribution of general quantum states , let us study the fourier transform of the gs distribution @xmath20 which is referred to as characteristic function and where the normally ordered displacement operator reads @xmath21 . the inverse fourier transform is @xmath22 any quantum state @xmath23 may be also described by its density operator in the fock basis @xmath24 in the first step , the distributions that describe the basis elements @xmath25 will be considered .",
    "rigorously speaking , we adopt the approach of sudarshan  @xcite , who showed that for any quantum state the representation   exists , in fourier space . note that this work is restricted to single - mode considerations only .",
    "however , a generalization to multimode scenarios is straightforward .",
    "the characteristic function   of @xmath25 reads @xmath26 applying the inverse transformation , one gets the corresponding @xmath1 distribution as @xmath27 thus , we can formally write for any fock basis element @xmath28 . using the fock expansion   of @xmath0 , we obtain the @xmath1 function in the form @xmath29 we will discuss this decomposition in detail later on .      the unitary displacement and the normally ordered displacement operators are related via the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula @xmath30 . as the modulus of any unitary operator is bounded by one , one finds with the above relation for the characteristic function  @xcite @xmath31 let us also emphasize that it has been shown in  @xcite that for all classical states @xmath32 holds .",
    "moreover , one should recall that the asymptotic behavior in fourier space is closely related to the regularity in the original space .",
    "that is , in terms of sobolev s lemma  @xcite , if @xmath33 is an integrable function , @xmath34 , then @xmath35 is continuous .",
    "conversely , the maximal increase in inequality   bounds the maximal singularity of the gs distribution . as",
    "the phase @xmath36 does not affect this bound , one may write the characteristic function of the worst - case distribution as @xmath37 applying the inverse fourier transform , the corresponding @xmath1 distribution is consequently @xmath38 the discussion of this distribution will be done in the following sections . in the rest of this work , we will refer to a distribution that is at most as singular as @xmath39 as a gs distribution .",
    "combining eqs .   and  , one directly observes that any gs distribution , which describes a quantum state , has the formal structure @xmath40 here let us already mention that the sum yields , in general , an infinite order of derivatives of the dirac @xmath9  distribution , which is substantially different from any finite order , as we will observe in detail later on . in this section",
    ", we will further characterize these types of distributions properly .",
    "examples will underline the features of gs distributions .",
    "in addition , some representations of @xmath41 are also considered .",
    "let us study some properties of the elements @xmath42 in eq .   and their combinations in eq .",
    "the symmetry @xmath43 is a direct consequence of the relations @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the normalization reads @xmath46 by using the integral @xmath47 and with @xmath48 denoting the kronecker symbol . combining both results with the properties of the fock matrix elements @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    ", we find the well known facts that the @xmath1 distribution in the form   is real - valued ( in the sense of distribution theory ) , @xmath51 , and normalized , @xmath52  @xcite .",

    "being the fock representation to the distribution @xmath41 with an infinite rank , we can see that @xmath57 is neither normalized , @xmath62 , nor a positive operator ( negative eigenvalues for odd @xmath63 values ) .",
    "therefore , it does not represent a valid quantum state .",
    "however , the operator @xmath64 represents a valid quantum state , that is , a thermal state with a mean thermal photon number @xmath65 .",
    "it should be stressed that the thermal state , which is defined in eq .",
    ", will be used for comparing different distributions later on .",
    "the characteristic functions of @xmath6-parametrized quasiprobabilities @xmath66 and the one of the @xmath1 distribution ( @xmath67 ) can be related  @xcite , @xmath68 thus , we have for the maximal gs distribution an @xmath6-parametrized characteristic function @xmath69 and its fourier transform @xmath70 see also appendix  [ app : exponentiallaplace ] for further details on exponential operators of @xmath71 . in the form  , it can be seen for the wigner representation ( @xmath7 ) that the maximally singular wigner distribution is a dirac @xmath9  distribution @xmath72 this supports the result that the wigner function is regular for any quantum state , as @xmath73 of the maximally singular distribution @xmath41 has `` only '' the singularity of a dirac @xmath9  distribution .    for any @xmath74",
    ", it can be also observed that the fourier transform is not unique for general gs distributions .",
    "namely , we have @xmath75 in this case , which also has the inverse fourier transform : @xmath76 in the following we discuss the relation between eqs .   and   on the basis of an example .",
    "we may consider a thermal state described by the density matrix @xmath77^m$ ] for a mean thermal photon number @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath78 its characteristic function is @xmath79 .",
    "inserting the fock expansion   into relation   yields @xmath80 in contrast , it was shown for thermal states that we have a regular gaussian @xmath1 distribution  @xcite @xmath81 similarly to the previous discussion of the @xmath6-parametrized @xmath1 representation for @xmath74 .    the mathematical interpretation of the ambiguity of eqs .   and   is simple .",
    "the same distributions can be represented in different forms ; see also  @xcite .",
    "however , in many papers one can read statements similar to the following : ` a nonclassical state is described by a negative @xmath1 function or a distribution which is more singular than the dirac @xmath9  distribution . '",
    "considering the example of a classical thermal state at hand [ eq .",
    "] , one can see that such a statement is incorrect",
    ". having a closer look at the original definition of nonclassicality , it is stated that classical states are those `` ... fields which have a positive - definite @xmath82 ... '' distribution  @xcite .",
    "that is , independently of the representation , if a clearly non - negative @xmath1 representation exists [ for example , in eq .",
    "] , the state is classical .",
    "moreover , the definition relates to the distribution as a linear map on test functions @xmath83 , e.g. , @xmath84 for classical @xmath82 , which is independent of the representation of @xmath1 ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : dual ] ) .",
    "finally , let us make another remark .",
    "the confusion with the singularities of the @xmath1 distribution in the literature is due to the fact the general decomposition   and those in ref .",
    "@xcite require a sum of all orders of derivatives of the dirac @xmath9  distribution , which are typically not taken into account . in the case of finite distributions @xmath85 for @xmath86",
    ", we can apply the result in  @xcite to see that , indeed , the corresponding states are necessarily nonclassical if finite orders of derivatives of @xmath87 are involved .",
    "as the characteristic function @xmath88 in such a finite case is a polynomial [ cf .  ] , which is not constant , it will necessarily exceed the classical limit for some large @xmath89 value , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "previously , we have shown that the operator @xmath57 does not represent a physical quantum state . here",
    ", however , it is shown that @xmath41 can be considered as a bound to any quantum state .",
    "in particular , one can demonstrate that the upper bound in eq .   can be approached by physical states for any direction in phase space .    for this aim ,",
    "we consider , up to a rotation and a displacement in phase space , a general pure squeezed state @xmath91 which is characterized by the squeezing parameter @xmath92 .",
    "compared to the variance of the field fluctuations of the vacuum state , this squeezed state has a noise reduction ( amplification ) of a factor @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) in the squeezed ( antisqueezed ) direction of phase space  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic function of this squeezed state reads @xmath95 choosing the particular direction @xmath96 , we have @xmath97\\frac{1}{2}|\\beta|^2\\right ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , for @xmath98 , we approach the rising behavior of @xmath99 . a rotation in phase space , @xmath100 ,",
    "allows us to make the same statement for any direction .",
    "however , this can not be done for all directions simultaneously , as we have for our specific example   in the direction @xmath101 a decaying characteristic function , which reads @xmath102|\\beta|^2/2)$ ] .",
    "finally , we can conclude from the fourier transform of eq .",
    ", see also  @xcite or appendix  [ app : exponentiallaplace ] , that any direction of @xmath41 in phase space can be considered as the limiting distribution of an infinitively squeezed state in this phase - space direction .",
    "this also relates to our earlier observation that the wigner function of the maximal gs distribution [ eq .  ]",
    "is described by a dirac @xmath9  distribution , which resembles a `` state '' with an infinite squeezing in all phase - space directions .      in this section",
    ", the characterization of singular gs distributions has been performed .",
    "first , the state representation in terms of a sum over all derivatives of the dirac @xmath9  distribution has been studied .",
    "we showed that such a representation is ambiguous in the sense that a regular and a highly singular distribution may describe the same state .",
    "this was discussed on the basis of the @xmath6-parametrized quasiprobabilities as well as the example of a thermal state .",
    "second , the features of the most singular gs distributions @xmath41 have been considered .",
    "in particular , the fock expansion and the @xmath6 parametrization of such a distribution have been established .",
    "based on the example of a squeezed state , we showed that for any direction in phase space , this maximally singular distribution can be approached .",
    "thus , it represents a strict bound to the singularities of any @xmath1 representation .",
    "the approximation of a singular phase - space distribution with regular ones has always been a subject of many investigations .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that any @xmath1 distribution can be retrieved in the limit of smooth  @xcite or square integrable  @xcite functions .",
    "a general method to access regular phase - space functions was formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite and further specified in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "the regularization of @xmath1 distributions is done such that it can unconditionally uncover the nonclassicality of light via regular , so - called , filtered quasiprobabilities .",
    "moreover , it was shown that , for certain filter functions , these filtered quasiprobabilities are not only continuous , but also smooth functions  @xcite .    here",
    "we aim at applying this filter approach to characterize the distribution @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we briefly recapitulate the approach in  @xcite with slightly different notation . the filtered quasiprobability is the convolution @xmath103 where @xmath104 represents , for any parameter @xmath105 , a sufficiently well - behaved positive - semi - definite probability density that has a limit @xmath106 .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that these requirements are fulfilled if @xmath104 is the inverse fourier transform of a function @xmath107 with a function @xmath108 that decays sufficiently fast for @xmath109 .",

    "in such a case , we can bound @xmath153    moreover , in appendix  [ app : convr ] it is shown that the taylor series   of our considered class of test functions , which satisfy  , converges for any @xmath5 . thus , the taylor series describes @xmath55 globally and not only in the neighborhood of @xmath17 .",
    "this also confirms that the expression in eq .   is not only depending on local properties of @xmath55 .",
    "in addition to the finite derivative scenario in eq .  , the taylor series discussed here completely describes the function . again",
    ", this underlines that @xmath41 addresses global properties , which is in contrast to distributions with a finite order of derivatives of the dirac @xmath9  distribution .",
    "the latter ones are the typically discussed examples in the context of singular gs distributions .",
    "however , the general complexity of irregular distributions in quantum optics can be studied with our maximally singular gs distribution @xmath41 .",
    "let us also mention that the constraint   is stronger ( more restrictive ) than the constraint  .",
    "thus , the family of test functions that fulfill the former conditions are at least analytic and thus smooth functions . as final remark , note that the functions @xmath55 , satisfying condition  , are certainly in the desired class of suited test functions of gs distributions .",
    "however , there might be other test functions that do not fulfill that requirement , although any expectation value   for any gs distribution is finite .",
    "thus , proving that condition   is also necessary requires further investigation .      in this work",
    ", we focused on the singular behavior of the @xmath1 distribution in terms of derivatives of the dirac @xmath9  distribution .",
    "however , one can define other notions of singularities that are connected to other aspects of a distribution that is applied to general test functions .",
    "let us consider such an example .",
    "we may study a family of regular and classical @xmath1 functions .",
    "those are @xmath154 for @xmath155 .",
    "the form of singularity considered here is given by the asymptotic behavior @xmath156 for large coherent amplitudes @xmath157 .",
    "let us compute the expectation value of test functions @xmath83 being @xmath152th - order polynomials .",
    "it is sufficient to consider monomials @xmath158 that yield ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) @xmath161 where the latter asymptotic form takes a finite value if @xmath162 .",
    "for @xmath163 the integral diverges .    a nonclassical state with such a type of asymptotic behavior is @xmath164 with @xmath165 .",
    "the state is constructed in analogy to the discussion in ref .",
    "the corresponding density operator @xmath23 is diagonal in the fock basis [ @xmath166 does not depend on the phase @xmath167 and it has no vacuum contribution , @xmath168 . as for any classical state @xmath169 holds , this is a nonclassical state  @xcite .",
    "let us briefly discuss these results .",
    "the given family of states   and   can not be completely characterized by their moments , as most of them do not exist . due to their asymptotic behavior",
    ", these functions could also be considered as singular distributions . in particular , the example @xmath170 is interesting from the physical point of view .",
    "quantum states that are described by this classical cauchy - lorentz distribution , @xmath170 in eq .  , have an infinite energy , because of an infinite photon number [ @xmath171 , i.e. , @xmath172 in eq .  ] . despite the fact that the @xmath1 function is a regular and classical one , they can not be generated by a realistic physical process with a finite energy . moreover , the nonclassicality of the state in eq .   for @xmath170",
    "can not be confirmed with the matrix of moments nonclassicality criteria  @xcite . instead , its nonclassicality can be inferred , for example , with the nonclassicality tests in ref .",
    "this means that the asymptotic behavior and the requirement of physical processes for the state preparation gives another form of singular behavior and restricts the set of possible distributions , respectively .",
    "in summary , a characterization of the singularities of phase - space distributions has been performed with a special emphasize on the maximally singular glauber - sudarshan distribution .",
    "different regular and irregular phase - space representations beyond the glauber - sudarshan distribution have been studied . a sufficient criterion for the dual space , i.e.",
    ", the family of sufficiently smooth test functions for identifying nonclassicality , has been presented for this physically relevant class of distributions .",
    "this treatment is relevant from the fundamental point of view as singular distributions describe many physically relevant scenarios in quantum optics . from the experimental point of view",
    ", measurements with experimentally generated quantum states are typically described by singular glauber - sudarshan distributions , e.g. , squeezed or fock states .    in this work ,",
    "the general expansion of any quantum state of light was considered in terms of distributions that contain all orders of derivatives of the dirac @xmath9  distribution .",
    "the difference between a finite order of derivatives and an infinite order was elaborated .",
    "namely , it was shown that a finite order necessarily yields a nonclassical state , whereas an infinite order does not allow such a conclusion , which was further supported with the example of a thermal state .",
    "hence , a statement that a highly singular glauber - sudarshan distribution describes a nonclassical state is not always true .",
    "a maximally singular glauber - sudarshan distribution was established and its properties have been studied . along with other aspects",
    ", it was demonstrated that such a distribution does not describe a quantum state of light .",
    "however , it can be approached with , for example , squeezed states for any fixed direction in phase space .",
    "thus , the maximally singular distribution can be formally considered as a `` state '' with an infinite squeezing in any phase - space direction , which violates the uncertainty principle .",
    "we also showed that methods that can regularize the singularities of this maximally singular distribution are automatically applicable to any physical quantum state of light .",
    "therefore , this single maximally singular distribution serves as a benchmark for any physical state .",
    "moreover , a suitable class of test functions ( dual space for the considered class of distributions ) was derived .",
    "it has been shown that such test functions have to be even more regular than typically assumed to overcome the singularities of the glauber - sudarshan distribution . finally , other types of irregularities have been discussed .",
    "let us formulate some additional conclusions .",
    "the glauber - sudarshan representation is a key notion in quantum optics for discerning classical from nonclassical light .",
    "thus , it is required to have a profound knowledge of the irregularities that might occur in this phase - space distribution , e.g. , for performing an experimental quantum state reconstruction .",
    "in particular , the given simple examples and counter - examples underline the fact that an intuition of singularities might lead to incomplete or even incorrect interpretations of the quantum nature of the system under study .",
    "thus , the present work might lead to a deeper understanding of the nonclassical effects in quantized radiation fields .",
    "this work has received funding from the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no 665148 .",
    "this work is dedicated to professor werner vogel , universitt rostock , who is contributing to the field of theoretical quantum optics for more than 40 years .",
    "i want to thank werner for all the enlightening discussions and for supporting me .",
    "i also acknowledge helpful comments by e. agudelo .",
    "in quantum optics , we have a particular mathematical analysis with coherent amplitudes @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is a complex number that may be decomposed into its real part @xmath173 and imaginary part @xmath174 . in order to avoid confusion with complex analysis and for our rigorous analysis ,",
    "let us recall some known but important aspects of this treatment .",
    "for example , the function @xmath175 is not differentiable in complex analysis , but in quantum optics we have : @xmath176 or @xmath177 .",
    "we may identify a quantum optical function @xmath83 with a function of two real - valued variables @xmath178 the dirac @xmath9  distribution takes the form @xmath179 with @xmath180 .",
    "the derivatives can be written correspondingly as @xmath181 which follows from eq .   or the identification @xmath182/2,-i[\\alpha-\\alpha^\\ast]/2)$ ] .",
    "furthermore , the fourier transform is @xmath183 where we used @xmath184 . in the following",
    "we will apply this formulation in terms of two real values rather than the complex coherent amplitude . in this sense",
    "one can see that , e.g. , @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) is properly retrieved .",
    "throughout this work , we encountered derivatives of the form @xmath71 .",
    "such an operator can be identified with the two - dimensional laplace operator @xmath185 , as we have @xmath186 where we applied eq .  .",
    "the operator @xmath187 is a positive - semi - definite operator . from the bounded eigenfunctions , we get the non - negative eigenvalues @xmath188 with real values @xmath189 and @xmath190 [ cf . also eq .  ] .",
    "this means that the exponential laplace operator @xmath191 has for @xmath155 ( @xmath192 ) the eigenvalues @xmath193)$ ] , which are greater ( less ) than one . for @xmath194",
    ", one can set @xmath195 .",
    "this means that the exponential laplace operator   describes the identity for @xmath194 , a contractive map for @xmath192 , and an expansive map for @xmath155 .",
    "note that this relates to the classical or nonclassical features of @xmath196 for different @xmath197 values .",
    "further , let us formulate the @xmath1 distribution of the pure squeezed state with the characteristic function in eq .  .",
    "the identification @xmath198 allows one to compute @xmath199k_x - i[2{\\rm re}\\alpha]k_p\\right)\\nonumber          \\\\&\\times\\exp\\left(-\\frac{e^{2\\xi}-1}{2}k_x^2+\\frac{1-e^{-2\\xi}}{2}k_p^2\\right)\\nonumber          \\\\=&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi\\left(e^{2\\xi}-1\\right)}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2[{\\rm im}\\alpha]^2}{e^{2\\xi}-1}\\right)\\label{eq : antisqp }          \\\\&\\times\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1-e^{-2\\xi}}{2}\\frac{\\partial_{{\\rm re}\\alpha}^2}{4}\\right)\\delta({\\rm re}\\alpha)\\label{eq : sqp}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this form , the third line   represents the antisqueezed direction @xmath137 , which is described by a regular gaussian distribution , and the fourth line   corresponds to the squeezed direction @xmath136 , which resembles an exponential second derivative of the one - dimensional dirac @xmath9  distribution .",
    "for the considered considered in fig  [ fig : regpexamples ] , let us derive analytic expressions for the filtered and regular phase - space representation @xmath200 .",
    "in a compact form , the definition reads  @xcite @xmath201 let us take the first example of a function @xmath202 that was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath203 for @xmath204 and @xmath205 , and otherwise @xmath206 .",
    "this yields @xmath207 , where the triangular function is given by @xmath208 in particular , this is a real - valued function with @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "moreover , the examples of gaussian characteristic functions can be written as @xmath211 with @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and real numbers @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "note that a displacement and rotations in phase space could also be included .",
    "now , eq .   reduces to @xmath216    we may evaluate the following function : @xmath217          \\\\\\nonumber=&{\\rm re}\\left[\\frac{e^{-g+2 i y}-1}{\\pi   g}\\right .",
