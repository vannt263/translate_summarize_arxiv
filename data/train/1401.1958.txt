    "the central region of the galaxy has a dense population of visible stars and most likely , also of compact objects , such as black holes , neutron stars and intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) . in combination with the supermassive blackhole ( smbh )",
    "sgr a * , these bhs or imbh can make their presence felt e.g. , by gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "the laser interferometric gravitational observatory will attempt to detect gw by change of baselines ( the  strains \" or the fractional changes ) between two arms of an interferometer .",
    "the alternate idea of detecting gws by monitoring the arrival times of radio pulses from neutron stars ( pulsar timing ) was proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the formulation in terms of an array of pulsars and their correlations of pulse arrival time residuals was given by @xcite .",
    "while ligo and advanced ligo are sensitive to a frequency range 10hz -100 khz , the pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) probe gws typically in the 300 picohz to 100 nanohz . in this frequency band , the strongest gravitational waves are likely to be from binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another resulting from galaxies merging with one another . for the gw source in the central part of our own galaxy , the prospects of resolving individual objects through gw measurements improve closer to sgr a * even if the number density of objects steeply increases inward , quite unlike the case of imaging by electromagnetic techniques . in this paper",
    "we discuss future prospects of detecting gravitational waves from the galactic center by accurate timing of pulsars which may be discovered in the galactic center with sensitive telescope arrays in the future ( we refer to @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the central region of the galaxy , very likely , has a dense population of compact objects , including about 20,000 stellar mass black holes ( bhs ; @xcite ; @xcite and perhaps a few imbh of mass @xmath0 imbhs ( @xcite ) may be created by the collapse of pop iii stars in the early universe ( @xcite ) , runaway collisions of stars in the cores of globular clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) , or the merger of stellar mass black holes ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the globular clusters can be tidally stripped when they sink to the galactic nucleus as a result of dynamical friction , leaving their imbhs behind in the galactic nucleus .",
    "@xcite predict that the inner @xmath1pc of the gc hosts 50 imbhs of mass @xmath2 .",
    "these objects as also the stellar mass bhs are much more massive than regular stars populating the gc and they segregate and settle to the core of the central star cluster . for a circular binary of an object ( @xmath3 ) e.g. an imbh or a bh , orbiting around a smbh of mass @xmath4 the orientation averaged rms strain generated at distance @xmath5 from the source in one gw cycle is @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 with the gw frequency @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the orbital radius around smbh and the index 0 on h stands for zero eccentricity .",
    "the total gw signal with frequency @xmath12 ( the  characteristic spectral amplitude \" @xmath13 ) from a population of sources ( with a number in a shell @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number density of objects ) is : @xmath16\\,.\\ ] ] the gw signal generated by a population of objects ( the  foreground \" ) is smooth if the average number per @xmath17 frequency bin satisfies @xmath18 .",
    "the gw spectrum becomes spiky ( with @xmath19 ) above a critical frequency @xmath20 that depends on the number of objects within 1pc of the gc and on the timing observation span .",
    "sources within @xmath21 generate distinct spectral peaks above frequency @xmath20 .",
    "these sources are _",
    "resolvable_. the gw spectrum transitions from continuous to discrete at higher frequencies inside the pta band and there may be a number of resolvable sources ( @xcite ) .     vs. gw frequency @xmath12 for detection by a pulsar at 1pc ( left ) and 0.1pc ( right ) from the galactic center .",
    "dotted white lines show the orientation - averaged @xmath22 for fixed timing residuals .",
    "yellow and cyan dashed lines show respectively the orientation - averaged timing residuals caused by individual stellar bhs and imbhs on circular orbits in a 10 yr observation , assuming 1 object per frequency bin .",
    "green lines ( histogram ) show the timing residuals for a random realization of @xmath23 stellar bhs in the cluster ( 20,000 bhs within 1 pc with number density @xmath24 ) . at high @xmath12 ,",
    "only few bins are occupied , generating a spiky signal .",
    "magenta dashed lines show the cosmological rms stochastic gw background .",
    ", width=403 ]",
    "if pulsars are observed repeatedly in time for an observation span @xmath25 yr and with @xmath26 week , the range of gw frequencies is : @xmath27 .",
    "the cosmological gw background from the whole population of mbhbs is actually an astrophysical `` noise '' for the purpose of measuring the gws of objects orbiting sgra*. the characteristic gw amplitudes ( either of a stochastic background or of a resolvable source ) can be translated into into a ",
    "characteristic timing residual \" @xmath28 corresponding to a delay in the time of arrivals of pulses due to gws , after averaging over the sky position and polarizations . the timing signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) is proportional to @xmath29 which incorporates the @xmath30 factor that accounts for the residual built - up over the number of gw cycles , @xmath13 being the characteristic spectral amplitude .",
    "the distance within which a pta could measure the gws of an individual source with a fixed timing precision @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "the expressions for the strain amplitudes ( see eq . ( 13 ) and ( 16 ) of @xcite ) for a resolved binary source and that for the stochastic gw background ( dominated by smbhb inspirals ) show that the gws from an individual bh in the gcs rises above the stochastic gw background within a distance @xmath33 .",
    "thus a pulsar within @xmath34 and @xmath35 to the gc could be used to detect gws from individual objects in the gc .",
    "prospects of gw detection from the gc depends upon future discoveries of pulsars near the gc and timing them with sufficient accuracy .",
    "active radio pulsars/ ms psrs may segregate to the outer parts of the gc as heavier objects sink inward ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite examined the expected timing accuracy of pulsars in the gc and found that the @xmath36 timing accuracy of ska is expected to be between @xmath37@xmath38 for regular pulsars .",
    "our results summarized in fig . 1 indicate that the necessary accuracy to detect timing variations associated to individual @xmath39 bhs within 1mpc requires much higher timing accuracy , which might be prohibitively difficult even with msps with a factor of 1001000 better timing accuracy .",
    "however , the net variations caused by a population of these objects is detectable between 25 mpc at these accuracy levels .",
    "as seen from fig 1 , a @xmath37@xmath38 timing accuracy is sufficient to individually resolve or rule out the existence of @xmath40 imbhs within 5 mpc from sgra*. as a point of reference , the parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) project aims to time 20 pulsars , with an rms of 100 ns over five years ( @xcite ) .",
    "a large population of pulsars may reside inside the gc ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite predict as many as 100 canonical psrs and a larger population of ms psrs in the central parsec of the gc .",
    "the discovery of gc magnetar sgr j1745 - 29 with nustar and subsequently in the @xmath41 ghz radio bands ( @xcite , @xcite ) shows that the source angular sizes are consistent with scatter broadened size of sgra * at each radio frequency .",
    "this demonstrates that the two sources , separated by 3 \" ( 0.12 pc in projection ) are both located behind the same hyperstrong scattering medium , e.g. a  thin \" screen at  6 kpc from the gc . the pulse broadening timescale at 1 ghz ( @xcite ) is several orders of magnitude lower than the scattering predicted by ne2001 model .",
    "the scattering in the gc is lower than previously thought .",
    "the scattering material could be patchy at small angular scales ( @xcite ) and it may be possible to peer through such  keyholes \" in the radio bands for a region around gc .",
    "@xcite using monte carlo simulation estimate an upper limit of  950 potentially observable radio loud pulsars in gc .",
    "however , @xcite point out that despite several deep radio surveys , no ordinary pulsars have been detected very close to the gc and suggest an intrinsic deficit in the ordinary pulsar population .",
    "this analysis does not constrain the millisecond pulsar population significantly as yet . since it now appears that they can be observed at somewhat lower frequencies because of the nature of the scattering , deeper surveys at @xmath42 ghz",
    "may be able to discover them .",
    "future discovery of such pulsars in the gc may facilitate the long term timing and search for gravitational waves due to imbhs .",
    "bhs in orbit around smbh sgra * generates a continuous gw spectrum with @xmath43 nhz .",
    "individual bhs within 1 milliparsec to sgra * stick out in the spectrum at higher frequency .",
    "gws can be resolved by timing psrs located within this region .",
    "a 100 ns - 10 @xmath44s timing accuracy with ska will be sufficient to detect imbhs ( @xmath45 ) , if they exist , in a 3 yr observation if the psrs are @xmath46 pc away from sgra*. unlike electromagnetic imaging , resolving individual binaries via gws detected by pulsar timing will improve as one probes the region closer to sgra*."
