    "matrix equations , which in the most general form can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are some fixed matrices , @xmath2 are unknowns , @xmath3 is an associative noncommutative polynomial , and the solutions must belong to a certain class of matrices , constitute a vast research domain , with spectacular applications well beyond algebra , say , in areas such as differential equations and mathematical physics .",
    "noncommutativity brings lots of counter - intuitive phenomena , which can be observed even when asking deceptively simple questions about solvability of the equation or about the number of its solutions , even within the class of innocently looking quadratic matrix equations , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( of course , the reader coming from differential equations and familiar , say , with riccati matrix equations will not be too much surprised by the difficulty of the question . )    to simplify the problem , one can limit oneself to considering equations of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the only allowed constant matrix , and only scalar constants are permitted to appear as coefficients of the polynomial @xmath3 . even in this limited form , the question about solvability of is far from being settled though it has been extensively studied since the 1970 s when kaplansky asked about the existence of polynomials whose value sets consist of the scalar matrices .",
    "such polynomials ( called central ) were discovered by formanek @xcite and razmyslov @xcite ; naturally , if @xmath3 is central and the matrix @xmath5 is not scalar then equation has no solutions .",
    "the same happens in the case where the value set of @xmath3 consists of matrices with zero trace ( say , when @xmath3 is a lie polynomial ) and @xmath6 ( and , of course , in the trivial case where @xmath3 is identically zero on the algebra m@xmath7 of @xmath8-matrices with coefficients from the field @xmath9 ) . however , there are subtler obstacles to the solvability of , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "even a very special case where @xmath3 is a lie polynomial is not yet settled though some cases where is solvable as well as some obstacles to solvability were discussed in @xcite .",
    "further simplification is essential for the present survey : we focus our attention on the case where the solutions to the equations under consideration must belong to a certain _ multiplicative group _ of matrices .",
    "this naturally leads to the next modification : instead of considering polynomials @xmath3 as in , which can be viewed as elements of the free associative algebra @xmath10 , we consider monomials @xmath11 , which can be regarded as elements of the free @xmath12-generated group @xmath13 .",
    "thus our main object is the following equation ( where we shorten our previous notation for @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a fixed element of a group @xmath17 , and we are looking for solutions among @xmath12-tuples @xmath18 of elements of @xmath17 .",
    "by @xmath19 we understand the element of @xmath17 obtained after substituting the @xmath20 instead of the @xmath21 and performing all multiplications and inversions in @xmath17 .",
    "we define @xmath22 as the set of values of @xmath14 in @xmath17 .",
    "although equation ( henceforth called a word equation ) makes sense in the case where @xmath17 is not necessarily a group of matrices , we make emphasis on the matrix case .",
    "the reason is two - fold .",
    "first , main applications we are going to discuss refer to the cases where @xmath17 has nice natural matrix representations .",
    "second , our main goal is to stress the strength of algebraic - geometric methods in treating problems related to word equations .",
    "more specifically , our viewpoint can be described as follows : let us regard all matrix entries of the @xmath21 as indeterminates , then , after clearing denominators arising because of determinants , we reduce equation to a system of @xmath23 polynomial equations in @xmath24 variables over the ground field @xmath9 ( all matrices are assumed to be of size @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus we managed to go over from a noncommutative problem to a commutative one , but the paid price is high : the resulting system may be huge and unaccessible to computer algebra systems .",
    "however , in certain cases such an approach may turn out to be fruitful , and several instances of successful implementation of this idea will follow .",
    "once equation is proclaimed as the main object of our investigation , the first natural question one should ask oneself is the following : what is the most natural class of groups @xmath17 to start with ? a strong hint is given by a theorem of borel @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which states that if @xmath17 is the group of rational points of a connected semisimple algebraic group defined over an infinite field , then for any @xmath25 equation is solvable when its right - hand side is , roughly speaking , a `` typical '' element @xmath26 ; see section [ borel ] for a precise statement and some details .",
    "thus the most substantial part of the present survey is devoted to the case where @xmath17 is a finite simple group .",
    "although in this case borel s theorem does not give any direct indication which elements should be thought of as `` typical '' , we shall try to convince the reader that there are several ways out which make some sense .",
    "in particular , larsen @xcite showed that for every nontrivial word @xmath14 and @xmath27 there exists a number @xmath28 such that if @xmath17 is a finite simple group with @xmath29 then @xmath30 , see section [ sec : image ] .",
    "one should note that there is not much hope for positive results of borel s flavour for groups @xmath17 which are too far from those singled out in his theorem ; see the discussion in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) and relevant references therein ( to which one should add a recent paper by myasnikov and nikolaev @xcite ) . therefore , as mentioned above , we restrict ourselves to considering the case where @xmath17 runs within a family of finite non - abelian simple groups . moreover , since most of the problems will be of asymptotic nature , we shall usually ignore the sporadic groups .",
    "being even more restrictive , we focus our attention to the case of the family @xmath31 ( sometimes extending it to all groups of lie rank 1 , thus adding the family of suzuki groups @xmath32 ) .",
    "this case is , on the one hand , typical enough , and sufficiently rich to have interesting applications . on the other hand ,",
    "it allows one to use some additional efficient tools ( such as trace maps ) and get more precise results .",
    "details can be found below , in sections [ wai ] , [ ad ] and [ sl2 ] .",
    "one can ask various questions on equation .",
    "first , one can fix a concrete group or a family of groups @xmath17 ( say , @xmath33 ) , a concrete element @xmath16 of @xmath17 ( say , @xmath34 ) and a concrete word @xmath14 , and ask whether equation is solvable ( or has a non - identity solution , if @xmath34 is chosen ) .",
    "even in such a restrictive setting , some spectacular applications can be obtained , in particular , to a long - standing problem of characterization of finite solvable groups by recursive identities , see section [ wai ] .",
    "a variation of this approach , where one proves solvability of a countable system of equations @xmath35 ( with @xmath17 fixed as above ) , or , particularly , of the system @xmath36 with @xmath37 obtained after the @xmath38 iteration from certain initial data , can be reformulated in the language of periodic points .",
    "this viewpoint was ( implicitly ) taken in @xcite , where another sequence of words characterizing finite solvable groups was constructed , and made explicit in @xcite . in the latter paper",
    "this machinery has been further developed which led naturally to some new concepts in arithmetical dynamics .",
    "another impressive application of arithmetical dynamics to a hard group - theoretic problem has been demonstrated by borisov and sapir @xcite , @xcite , see section [ sapir ] .",
    "further , one can consider more general questions .",
    "first , still fixing some `` interesting '' word @xmath14 , one may vary @xmath26 and ask about the solvability of for all @xmath16 , or , at least , for `` most of @xmath16 s '' . in the language of word maps , where we denote by @xmath39 the map given by @xmath40 ,",
    "this means that we are asking whether the word map is surjective or , at least , has a `` large '' image .",
    "ore s conjecture @xcite on representing every element of a finite simple group as a commutator is a fabulous instance of such a setting . due to",
    "immense work spread over more than 50 years , it is now known that the commutator word @xmath41 \\in { \\mathcal{f}}_2 $ ] satisfies @xmath42 for any finite non - abelian simple group @xmath17 ( see @xcite , the references therein and section [ sect.comm ] below ) .",
    "it was therefore conjectured by shalev that a similar result also holds for iterated commutator ( so - called engel words ) .",
    "the study of this case started in @xcite ( for @xmath33 , see section [ sect.bg.bgg ] ) .",
    "the words of the form @xmath43 have also attracted special interest .",
    "larsen , shalev and tiep @xcite proved that any such word is surjective on sufficiently large finite simple groups . by further recent results of guralnick and malle @xcite and of liebeck , obrien , shalev and tiep @xcite , some words of the form @xmath44 are known to be surjective on _ all _ finite simple groups .",
    "the particular case of surjectivity of these words on @xmath31 was studied in @xcite ( see section [ sect.bg.bgg ] ) .",
    "a ramification of this sort of questions , where one asks whether any element @xmath26 ( or `` most '' of them ) can be represented as a product of at most @xmath45 values of @xmath14 ( @xmath45 is a fixed natural number ) , has been christened `` a waring - type problem '' by shalev ( by analogy to a celebrated problem on representing a natural number as a sum of @xmath45 powers ) , and a number of impressive results has been obtained .",
    "the most conclusive one , due to larsen , shalev and tiep , says that for every nontrivial word @xmath14 there exists a constant @xmath46 such that if @xmath17 is a finite simple group satisfying @xmath47 then @xmath48 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and section [ sect.waring ] below .",
    "note that a naive question whether @xmath42 for any nontrivial word @xmath14 and all sufficiently large finite simple non - abelian groups @xmath17 is clearly answered in the negative : indeed , it is easy to see that if @xmath17 is a finite group and @xmath49 is an integer which is not relatively prime to the order of @xmath17 then for the word @xmath50 one has @xmath51 . hence , if @xmath52 is any word , then the word map corresponding to @xmath53 can not be surjective . a natural question , suggested by shalev ,",
    "is whether these words are generally the only exceptions for surjectivity of word maps in finite non - abelian simple groups .",
    "yet another type of problems , first introduced in @xcite , arises when one asks about the behaviour of the fibres of the word map rather than about its image .",
    "namely , shalev asked ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 2.10 ) whether ( the cardinalities of ) these fibres are equidistributed ( or close to be equidistributed ) when @xmath16 varies in some `` large '' subset of the image of @xmath14 and @xmath17 runs over some family of finite groups .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the word @xmath54 , the commutator word @xmath41 \\in{\\mathcal{f}}_2 $ ] , as well as the words @xmath55 \\in { \\mathcal{f}}_d$ ] , @xmath12-fold commutators in any arrangement of brackets , are almost equidistributed on the family of finite simple non - abelian groups .",
    "the case @xmath33 was studied in some more detail in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see section [ sl2 ] .",
    "we do not pretend that the present overview of word maps is comprehensive .",
    "as one can see from the title , shamelessly plagiarized from manin s book @xcite , it was conceived for emphasizing the role of various tools lying outside group theory , particularly , of algebraic - geometric and arithmetic - geometric nature , in solving hard group - theoretic problems ( note , however , that the role of the `` algebra  geometry ",
    "arithmetic '' triad in manin s setting was somewhat different : his focus was on systematic use of algebraic , mainly galois - cohomological , methods in relating arithmetic phenomena , such as counter - examples to local - global principles , to geometric ones , such as non - rationality ; our viewpoint is different : a typical target is a group - theoretic question whereas algebraic and arithmetic geometry provide an efficient machinery ) .",
    "the reader inclined to purely algebraic approaches to word equations is referred to an excellent exposition given in a monograph by segal @xcite and a more recent survey by nikolov @xcite .",
    "vast literature on equations and system of equations in free ( and close to free ) groups is left aside ; see , e.g. , @xcite , particularly the introduction , for a comprehensive bibliographical survey of this theory .",
    "in this section we shall briefly describe some common machinery used while treating word matrix equations , leaving details , which may vary from one problem to another , for subsequent relevant sections ( note , in particular , that the problems discussed in section [ sec : word ] require lots of other techniques ) .",
    "our general setting is as follows .    1",
    ".   [ as.1 ] we view a matrix group @xmath17 as an algebraic variety @xmath56 embedded into an affine space , where the entries of a matrix @xmath57 play role of its coordinates @xmath58 ( though this is not the case if @xmath17 is a suzuki group , @xmath17 then has a `` large '' subset meeting this condition ; see section [ wai ] ) .",
    "[ as.2 ] group product @xmath59 is a polynomial morphism @xmath60    changing @xmath61 if necessary , we can guarantee that the inversion will also be a polynomial map ; in most cases , however , this is not needed because usually we work with matrices of determinant 1 .",
    "let @xmath62 be an integer , and let @xmath63 be a nontrivial element of the free group @xmath64 on @xmath12 letters @xmath65 this means that it is a reduced word in @xmath21 and @xmath66 with nonzero exponents .",
    "then , given a group @xmath67 the word @xmath14 defines a map @xmath68 ,    @xmath69    when no confusion may arise , we will shorten @xmath70 to @xmath14 .",
    "provided ( [ as.1 ] ) and ( [ as.2 ] ) , we may interpret an endomorphism of a group as a polynomial morphism @xmath71 and a word @xmath72 as a morphism @xmath73 similarly , for a word map @xmath74 and an element @xmath26 , a solution of the equation @xmath75 corresponds to an affine subvariety @xmath76    if @xmath17 is a _ finite group _",
    "( and this is the case in most applications considered in the present survey ) , we can choose the ground field to be a _ finite field _",
    "if the problem under consideration requires a study of a family of finite matrix groups @xmath78 , each defined over its own ground field @xmath79 , it is convenient to view @xmath78 as a fibre of a group @xmath80-scheme @xmath81 then solutions to the equation @xmath82 are described by points @xmath83    this leads to the following local - global approach : instead of solving equations in an infinite family of groups @xmath78 , one has to study a single @xmath80-scheme @xmath84 and then look at its fibres at every @xmath85      once the initial group - theoretic problem is reduced to an arithmetic geometry problem of proving the existence of a rational point on a variety defined over a finite field , a natural tool to use is the lang ",
    "weil inequality @xcite .",
    "it says that if @xmath86 is an @xmath87-dimensional _ absolutely irreducible _ variety over @xmath88 , then asymptotically ( i.e. , for @xmath89 large enough ) , the number of its rational points @xmath90 does not differ too much from the number @xmath91 of points of the @xmath87-dimensional projective space ( which is @xmath92 ) .",
    "namely , the difference is @xmath93 .",
    "if one can make this inequality _ effective _ , i.e. , compute or at least estimate @xmath94 and @xmath95 , one can guarantee the existence of an @xmath88-point on @xmath86 for @xmath89 large enough .",

    "the classical weil estimate gives an expression of the remainder term via the genus of the curve .",
    "one should not forget another difficulty related to checking absolute irreducibility of @xmath86 , which may be a highly nontrivial task in concrete examples .",

[ cremona ] it would be interesting to find more classes of infinite simple ( or close to simple ) groups admitting some analogue of borel s statement in the sense that the image of the word map is `` large '' , at least for a generic word .",
    "some such classes were discussed in the literature : infinite symmetric groups @xcite ( surjectivity of the commutator word was established by ore @xcite ) , groups of automorphisms of trees @xcite and of random graphs @xcite .",

    "[ profinite ] in light of the previous remark , one can note that analogues of borel s theorem may look differently at the first glance when one considers other classes of groups .",
    "say , a certain analogue of borel s theorem for profinite groups is provided by the following deep theorem by nikolov and segal @xcite , @xcite : let @xmath17 be a finitely generated profinite group , let @xmath14 be a non - commutator word , and let @xmath864 denote the corresponding verbal subgroup ( i.e. , the subgroup generated by the set @xmath865 ) ; then @xmath864 is open in @xmath17 .",
    "the original proof in @xcite went through the solution of the restricted burnside problem @xcite .",
    "an alternative proof in @xcite does not rely on zelmanov s theorem ( and , as pointed out to us by the referee , implies the statement of the restricted burnside problem ) .    to prevent the reader from an overoptimistic view on borel s theorem",

    "moreover , the image of the word map may be very large in the zariski topology ( according to borel s theorem ) but very small in some natural topology .",
    "see @xcite where such word maps are constructed for real compact lie groups .",
    "note that the behaviour of engel word maps on such groups is much better : they are all surjective @xcite .      regarding the image of the word map , we can recall here thompson s and shalev s conjectures [ conj.thompson ] , [ conj.surjall ] and [ conj.engel.shalev ] discussed in section [ sect.comm ] . in particular , one can ask whether the following variant of shalev s conjecture [ conj.surjall ] , for the family of groups @xmath574 , holds :      in particular , this conjecture holds for engel words and for words of the form @xmath577 ( see section [ sect.bg.bgg ] and @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one can therefore attempt to use the trace map method described in section [ tm ] to find more words satisfying the above conjecture .",

    ", it would be interesting to compare , in the general case , the properties of having large image and being equidistributed , in the spirit of corollary [ surj ] .",
    "we dare to formulate the following conjecture .",

    "they also ask whether their results on measure preservation can be extended to the class of compact lie groups ( with respect to the haar measure ) .",
