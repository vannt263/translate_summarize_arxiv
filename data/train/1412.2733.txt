    "since their discovery by @xcite and @xcite the giant gamma - ray structures also known as ",
    "fermi bubbles  located above and below the galactic center remain as one of the most attractive astrophysical events . despite their nature",
    "is still enigmatic the location of these objects indicates their connection with past or present activity in the center of our galaxy .",
    "different models relate the bubbles to starburst activity @xcite , single @xcite or multiple @xcite energy release events on a central black hole .",
    "fermi bubbles also are observed in other wavelengths .",
    "in particular observations in microwave band show a very good correlation of so - called  wmap haze  with gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "there are some indications on the hot plasma inside the fermi bubbles observed by a _",
    "rosat _ as a narrow envelope with very sharp edges @xcite .",
    "this structure is explained as a fast wind with a velocity @xmath0 cm / s driving a shock into the halo gas .",
    "however subsequent observations of fermi bubbles edges by _ suzaku _ did not find any evidences of a strong shock there @xcite .",
    "since fermi bubbles are very faint structures it is impossible to observe exactly the same phenomena in other galaxies .",
    "however some much more powerful objects with similar properties and probably similar nature are observed in some galaxies with active nuclei .",
    "for example even more giant structures are clearly seen in the direction of cen - a in ghz radio @xcite , gev @xcite and tev @xcite gamma - ray ranges .",
    "giant x - ray and radio lobes ( bubbles ) were found also in the galaxies ngc 3801 @xcite , mrk 6 @xcite and circinus galaxy @xcite .",
    "taking all facts together one can conclude that fermi bubbles are indeed real structures . since they enclose huge energy @xcite and",
    "their volume is comparable to that of the galactic disk fermi bubbles have a potential to affect the distribution of the cosmic rays ( crs ) in the galaxy .",
    "in particular in our paper @xcite we showed that fermi bubbles may be responsible for the formation of the cr spectrum above the  knee  .",
    "below we will briefly recapitulate the major points of this model and also discuss some consequences .",
    "it is generally accepted that supernova ( sn ) explosions in our galaxy can provide enough energy to produce the observed total luminosity of the cr ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover diffusive shock acceleration naturally explains power - law spectrum of cr @xcite and taking into account propagation effects their spectral index .",
    "however many fundamental questions related to the assumption of snrs being the sources of the galactic cr are still open .",
    "one of them is the maximum energy of cr which can be estimated from the age of a typical snr @xmath1 expanding with velocity of @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the magnetic field strength at the shock and the term @xmath6 in this case can be interpreted as an effective electric field .    for the parameters of the standard galactic snr and for reasonable values of the galactic magnetic field the maximum energy of cr protons can not exceed @xmath7 ev . in more complex models outside quasi - linear approximation",
    "it was shown that the magnetic field at the shock can be amplified . as a result for the conservative set of parameters maximum energy reaches the value of about @xmath8 ev .",
    "the important point of the cr spectrum is sudden steepening around @xmath9 ev which indicates on the change of the acceleration or propagation mechanism .",
    "smooth attachment of the spectra above and below this energy and sharpness of the transition indicates that we are dealing with sole spectrum rather than with sum of two distinct components .",
    "the review of different models suggested to explain this phenomenon can be found in the original paper @xcite .    in summary",
    ", it is generally agreed that sn shocks can only accelerate particles to energies @xmath10ev .",
    "however fermi bubbles with age and size exceeding that of typical snr by 4 orders of magnitude can easily accelerate particles to much higher energies . using eq .",
    "( [ eqemax ] ) one can estimate that the bubbles have a potential to form the spectrum of cr in between @xmath9 ev and @xmath11 ev .",
    "we do not consider the possibility that fermi bubbles can form a whole spectrum of cr both below and above @xmath9 ev .",
    "the reason for this is that the total power needed for the luminosity of crs in our galaxy @xmath12 erg / s @xcite and the average energy release toward the fermi bubbles is also @xmath13 erg / s @xcite .",
    "to explain the origin of cr by acceleration in the fermi bubbles one require the acceleration efficiency to be close to 100% which is unlikely .",
    "on the other hand the sudden change of the slope of the spectrum around the  knee  can be naturally explained due to change of the acceleration properties .",
    "thus our model can be described in the following way : snr in the disk accelerate particles with power - law distribution up to energies of @xmath9 ev and fermi bubbles further re - accelerate this particles up to @xmath11 ev .    in the model of fermi bubbles",
    "origin we suggested that the activity responsible for the formation of the bubbles was due to stellar capture and tidal disruption by a central black hole @xcite .",
    "the average time between two successive captures in the galaxy is between @xmath14 yrs and @xmath15 yrs @xcite .",
    "thus the activity is periodic and characteristic period between two event is shorter than the characteristic lifetime of the fermi bubbles .",
    "periodic energy releases in the galactic center should form series of shock propagating through the halo .",
    "we note that from the numerical simulations it appears that only very powerful events expected in the case of capture of massive stars can form shocks .",
    "thus the amount of shocks inside the fermi bubbles should not be very large .    in the exponential atmosphere of the halo with the scale @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17",
    ", an analytic solution of shock propagation was obtained by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : komp ] illustrates the process of shock propagation .",
    "this figure is meant to be illustrative only since it is valid only for cold homogeneous atmosphere with exponential density profile .",
    "environment of the galactic halo is expected to be more complex especially if it is affected by strong outflows from the galactic center .",
    "thus in reality the distribution of shocks should be far more complicated .",
    "however this simplified picture is able to explain the shape of the bubbles as well as their characteristic size .",
    "explosion energy was taken as @xmath18 erg , @xmath19g/@xmath20 and @xmath21 kpc are used for illustration purpose.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the separation between shocks can be estimates from their velocity @xmath22 and characteristic period of captures @xmath23 as @xmath24 however the exact separation between two consecutive shocks depends on the actual time separation of two consecutive capture events and their energy releases .",
    "there is another important spatial scale which characterizes processes of particle acceleration by a single shock , i.e. the acceleration length scale in a single shock @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the spatial diffusion coefficient near a shock whose value depends on particle interaction with small scale magnetic fluctuations and @xmath22 is the shock velocity .",
    "the problem of particle acceleration in conditions of supersonic turbulence ( multi - shock structure ) was extensively analyzed before . in series of papers by @xcite as applied to acceleration processes in ob associations , which is quite similar to the structure of the bubble , they introduce a nondimensional parameter characterizing acceleration regime as @xmath27 the corresponding energy @xmath28 that separates different regimes can be estimated from the condition @xmath29 or @xmath30 which for the conditions of the fermi bubble is @xmath31 in the case of @xmath32 or @xmath33 analyzed in @xcite , there is a combined effect of a fast particle acceleration by a single shock , which generates the spectrum @xmath34 and relatively slow transformation of this spectrum due to interaction with other shocks ( stochastic fermi acceleration ) into a hard @xmath35 spectrum in the intershock medium at relatively low energies .",
    "however it is unclear if such slow transformation can be completed within the life time of the shocks in the bubble .",
    "furthermore the hard @xmath35 spectrum requires significantly higher power to be formed in comparison with softer spectrum with the slope of @xmath34 .",
    "thus the transformation of the spectrum requires the power which significantly exceeds @xmath13 erg / s which the bubbles as we mentioned above can not supply .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that fermi bubbles do not affect the spectrum of cr below @xmath28 .",
    "this statement is in agreement with our initial assumption that snrs are the major contributors for crs with energies @xmath10ev and the exact particle spectrum generated from the bubble is unimportant in the energy range of @xmath36 .    for @xmath37 or @xmath38 the acceleration regime changes to a pure stochastic acceleration by a supersonic turbulence . in the stationary case",
    "the equation for accelerated crs can be presented in the form @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the cylindrical spatial coordinates , @xmath42 is the particle momentum , @xmath43 is the spatial diffusion coefficient and @xmath44 is the momentum diffusion coefficient .",
    "proton acceleration in the bubble depends sensitively on the acceleration parameters and structure of the bubble . in the following",
    "we present a detailed analysis .",
    "we present the bubble region as a cylinder extending above and below the galactic plane from @xmath45 to @xmath46 with a radius @xmath47 . as the boundary conditions we put the density of particles",
    "@xmath48 equaled zero at the galactic halo surface @xmath49 the diffusion coefficients inside and outside the bubble are supposed to be different @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the coefficient inside the bubble due to interactions with a supersonic turbulence and @xmath52 is the average diffusion coefficient in the galaxy defined e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the momentum diffusion coefficient is @xmath53 .",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath48 can be presented by a power - law function , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 should be determined from eq.([dif_bubble ] ) and approximately is @xmath56 thus a proper choice of @xmath57 allows to form a power - law distribution with a certain value of a spectral index .",
    "to consolidate this idea , we work out a concrete numerical model . essentially , we solve the stationary state cr transport equation  ( [ dif_bubble ] ) in our galaxy with two fermi bubbles ( one on each side of the galactic plane ) .",
    "we modeled our galactic halo as a cylinder of radius @xmath58 kpc , and the top and bottom at @xmath59 kpc from the mid - plane .",
    "each fermi bubble is also a cylinder of the same height @xmath59 kpc , but with a radius @xmath60 kpc .",
    "the spatial diffusion coefficient are different inside and outside the bubble as described by equation  ( [ spatialdiff ] ) .",
    "since we expect the average separation between shock in the fermi bubbles to be of order of 100 pc @xcite we consider a constant spatial diffusion coefficient and adopt @xmath61 @xmath62 s@xmath63 . outside the bubble , we take into account the energy ( or momentum ) dependence of the spatial diffusion coefficient and adopt @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath62 s@xmath63 ( cf .",
    "we assume that there is little or no stochastic acceleration outside the bubble ( see eq .",
    "( [ spatialdiff ] ) ) , and adopt @xmath66 ( i.e. , @xmath67 s@xmath63 or the corresponding acceleration time scale is @xmath68 myr ) .    for galactic snrs",
    "adopt the distribution suggested by @xcite and modified it with a gaussian thickness profile @xmath69 here we take @xmath70 pc , @xmath71 kpc .",
    "we adopt the idea that snrs inject energetic particles in the form of a power law with a high - energy cutoff at @xmath72 ev .",
    "therefore , together with the snr distribution ( equation  ( [ snrdist ] ) ) , the source function is @xmath73    finally , the appropriate boundary conditions for the momentum coordinate are @xmath74 where the energy of the lower momentum boundary is @xmath75 ev , and the upper momentum boundary is @xmath76 ev .",
    "the condition at the lower momentum ensures that the spectral index matches that of low - energy crs ( say @xmath77 ev ) .    the spatial boundary conditions are @xmath78 and @xmath79    the spectrum evaluated at earth s position is the solid line shown in figure  [ fig : dif+fermi2 ] .",
    "the model fits the data reasonably well and it is not coincident that the spectra join smoothly at the knee . the value of the parameter @xmath28 based on eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is not reliable . to check how the result depends on this parameter we estimated the spectrum for different values of @xmath28 ( see eq .",
    "( [ spatialdiff ] ) ) .",
    "it turns out that the shape of the spectrum does not depend on @xmath28 as long as @xmath80 ev .",
    "@xmath62 s@xmath63 inside the bubbles and @xmath81 @xmath62 s@xmath63 outside , @xmath66 , and the injection spectrum from snr @xmath82 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : q ] ) ) . ,",
    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we should note that in the estimations above we assumed that cr spectrum consist only of protons .",
    "this assumptions is for illustrative purposes only . to obtain the spectrum of different elements",
    "one should note that propagation and acceleration parameters depend only on rigidity .",
    "thus the spectra of all elements should have the same shape but should be shifted along the energy axis in accordance to their charge @xmath83 ( see e.g. fig . 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* for the details ) .",
    "due to the same shape of the spectrum one should expect several  knees  in the spectrum corresponding to different elements at the energies of @xmath84 ev . according to @xcite there is a knee - like structure in the heavy component of cr spectrum at about @xmath85 ev ( apparently corresponding to iron ) that strengthen this idea .    in this case spectrum of particles above the knee",
    "should be slightly softer than the one estimated by us for proton - only case .",
    "but as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) the value of the spectral index can be easily adjusted by a proper choice of the acceleration parameters .",
    "propagation of charged particles in the galaxy is mainly determined by their energy losses .",
    "since relativistic protons spend most of their time in the galactic halo their energy losses are insignificant and can be neglected .",
    "the same conclusion is also valid for electrons with energies below hundred gev . indeed in the galactic halo environment",
    "the density of soft photons and magnetic field strength are low allowing electrons to diffuse to more than 10 kpc before losing energy due to synchrotron and inverse - compton losses .",
    "since propagation of electrons is similar to that of protons one can expect that fermi bubbles should also affect the population of cr electrons near the earth .",
    "the effect of reacceleration should appear as a ",
    "bump  in the spectrum of electrons at energies of about 10 - 100 gev .",
    "however even before the influence of the fermi bubbles can be detected in the spectrum of cr electrons the effect of the reacceleration should be visible in the gamma - ray background . this phenomenon should appear as a gamma - ray image of the fermi bubbles .",
    "we note that in the frame of multi - shock model @xcite with the parameters described in the previous section electrons do not  feel  multiple shocks and their acceleration should be described as ordinary diffusive shock acceleration ( since @xmath32 , see the previous section ) .",
    "even if one assume that the separation between shocks is very small and @xmath86 becomes less than unity even for electrons with energy less than 1 tev the spectrum of re - accelerated electrons would be too soft and thus the overall spectrum of the electrons would not be affected .    in that sense reacceleration of electron responsible for gamma - ray emission from fermi bubbles and reacceleration of",
    "cr hadrons have generally speaking different nature .",
    "however we think that it is important to mention the possible difficulties which can appear in all models of fermi bubbles origin based on direct ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or indirect ( e.g. in * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* via bow shock ) acceleration of electrons .",
    "the reacceleration process can be roughly described as a smooth attachment of a power - law tail to the background distribution function i.e. the reaccelerated spectrum looks like @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the initial spectrum of particles before the reacceleration and @xmath89 is determined from the continuity of the particle flow in the energy space . in most cases",
    "@xmath89 can be estimated from the continuity of the derivative @xmath90 . in the case of galactic cr electrons",
    "the spectrum @xmath88 have a sharp spectral brake near 2.2 gev so it is reasonable to assume that @xmath91 gev .    in order to estimate the gamma - ray emission from",
    "the fermi bubbles one should integrate the spectrum of electrons over the line of sight . assume for simplicity that all reaccelerated electrons reside in the shell of thickness @xmath92 and introduce an  averaged  spectrum : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the distance along line of sight .",
    "since electrons at gev energies are weakly affected by losses and the distribution of them within the fermi bubble is almost constant @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the average spectral index of the reaccelerated particles along the line of sight . generally speaking @xmath97 from eq .",
    "( [ reacc1 ] ) due to effect of energy losses .",
    "the value of @xmath96 may weakly depend on energy but in this analysis we assume it constant for the sake of simplicity .    the intensity of the inverse compton emission can be estimated in the following way @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 is energy of the electrons corresponding to maximum and minimum energy of gamma - ray photons accordingly and @xmath101 are inverse compton energy losses . using for simplicity",
    "non - relativistic approximation @xmath102 and assuming that @xmath103 one can obtain that @xmath104 according to the one of the publicly available galprop simulations @xmath105 @xcite the density of electrons at 2 gev is @xmath106 @xmath107mev@xmath63 . the cut - off in the gamma - ray spectrum requires @xmath108 tev @xcite then @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the energy density of the soft photons .",
    "if we assume that @xmath111 as it is required by radio observations @xcite we obtain that the thickness of fermi bubble walls is only @xmath112 pc .",
    "this value is much smaller than the value of 1 - 2 kpc required to reproduce the spatial shape of the bubble and also require an extremely small spatial diffusion coefficient to confine relativistic electrons in a thin shell .",
    "a finer @xmath113 relations based on the correct expressions for the gamma - ray and radio emission together with some restriction from observation data are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddx ] .     necessary to produce observed gamma - ray flux ( thick line ) depending on the spectral index of relativistic electrons inside the bubble @xmath96 .",
    "vertical dashed line marks the expected spectrum of electrons based on radio data @xcite .",
    "horizontal dashed line marks the expected thickness based on the spatial structure @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ddx],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one can conclude that reacceleration process overproduces relativistic electrons .",
    "this effect does not depend on the nature of the reacceleration mechanism as long as it produces power - law spectrum of electrons . to avoid this problem",
    "it is necessary to introduce another kind of losses which should be effective in gev energy range .",
    "one of the possible solutions is introduction of adiabatic losses . indeed",
    "if the plasma flow in the galactic halo in the vicinity of fermi bubbles is non - uniform particles start to lose energy with a rate @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the flow velocity . according to @xcite the velocity of the galactic wind",
    "can be described as linear function of the altitude @xmath116 and the gradient value @xmath117 can be as high @xmath118s@xmath63 . with this",
    "rate adiabatic losses become essential in gev energy range and are able to significantly reduce the value of @xmath119 in ( [ thickness_f ] ) and soften the restrictions on @xmath92 and @xmath96 .",
    "we suggested a model of cr origin in energy range @xmath9 ev @xmath120 ev . in the model we assumed that cr with energies below @xmath9 ev",
    "are produced by snr in the galactic disk .",
    "this particles diffuse out to the galactic halo and then are reaccelerated in the fermi bubbles . for a proper choice of the acceleration parameters it is possible to reproduce the right value of the spectral index in energy range above the  knee  .",
    "the spectrum below the  knee  remains undisturbed .",
    "this model also naturally explains the smooth attachment of the spectra near the  knee  .",
    "it also explains the change of chemical composition of the cr at high energies if the rigidity dependence of the acceleration and propagation is taken into account .",
    "we also estimated the possible effect of the reacceleration of the cr electrons in the fermi bubbles .",
    "we showed the reacceleration process is very effective and it overproduces the expected gamma - ray flux from the fermi bubbles .",
    "this effect does not depend on the reacceleration mechanism as long as it produces power - law spectrum of electrons .",
    "however this restriction can be softened by introduction of the adiabatic losses caused by non - uniformity of the plasma flow inside the fermi bubbles .",
