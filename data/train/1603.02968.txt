    "manipulating quantum states of atomic ensembles opens interesting possibilities for storage and , potentially , processing of quantum information @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting are long - lived atomic states that can be used to trap an optical excitation ( a photon ) for a time @xmath0 much exceeding the lifetime @xmath1 of the excited state of an isolated atom . a very efficient way to trap a photon in an atomic medium is based on the use of the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite that is accompanied by a very slow or even vanishing group velocity of a weak probe pulse in a medium manipulated by a strong control beam @xcite .",
    "another phenomenon that can substantially delay a photon in an atomic medium is dicke subradiance @xcite .",

    "the lifetimes of the latter grow _ exponentially _ with the sample size @xmath2 and under realistic conditions , can be many orders of magnitude longer than the lifetimes of both the subradiant states and the states that build up in the regime of diffuse light scattering .",
    "there is a price to pay , however , since the disorder - induced localization of light in three dimensions turns out to be difficult to achieve @xcite and was predicted to be even impossible in an atomic ensemble in the absence of external fields @xcite .",
    "localized states may appear only in dense atomic systems under sufficiently strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this additional complication can be turned into advantage because the field can be used to tune the spatial localization of atomic states and their decay with time thus providing an efficient means of control over the trapping of light .",

    "our theory can be applied for short and intermediate times but needs to be extended by including doppler broadening and recoil effects to describe the long - time regime ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the two main difficulties on the way towards experimental realization of the control scheme proposed in the present work  the doppler broadening of the pulse and the atomic recoil effect  can be avoided or , at least , softened to a considerable extent by using a different , solid - state experimental realization of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in which atoms are replaced by quantum dots ( `` artificial atoms '' ) embedded in a transparent solid matrix or suspended in a viscous liquid .",

    "an analogous calculation for a transition with larger @xmath174 , @xmath175 ( like , e.g. , the transitions of rb atoms widely used in cold - atom experiments @xcite ) would be much more involved",

    "we illustrate this result by considering the limit of a very strong field but similar conclusions hold in weaker fields as well .",
    "most of our calculations were performed for a moderate number of atoms @xmath87 .",

    "we therefore believe that our conclusions apply to larger systems as well .",
    "our theoretical results can be verified in experiments and constitute an important step towards creation of controllable optical elements for future photonic devices to be used for quantum information storage and processing .",
