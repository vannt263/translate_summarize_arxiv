    "the goal of the present study is to impact some progress in understanding interplay between reactions and transport in structured spaces .",
    "there are many questions one could ask .",
    "this study focuses on one : how strongly the geometry of the system ( e.g. , topology and shape of the boundaries ) influences the particular reaction schemes it harbors ?",
    "this question can be asked in two ways .",
    "first , assuming that spatial structure is fixed , which reaction scheme would draw most benefit from it , for example , in terms of speed ( smaller execution time ) or better timing ( reduction of noise level ) ? second , given the chemical reaction , what is the topology that is mostly suited for it ? in order words , in which ways should one alter geometry of the system ( without altering reactants or influencing reaction mechanisms in any other way ) in order to speed up chemical reaction encapsulated inside ?",
    "answers to these questions are relevant to a number of topics ranging from understanding of physio - chemical processes in the living cell , biological evolution , towards chemical engineering and biotechnology .    taking the living cell as an example .",
    "the living cell exhibits large degree of spatial organization .",
    "various compartments sustain different chemical reactions and transport reactants among themselves , with a high degree of spatial and temporal synchronization .",
    "reactants and products of reaction are transported where they are needed , exactly at the right place and at the right time .",
    "there is no need of excessive storage of molecules . for reviews on these topic",
    "see  @xcite , and refs .",
    "@xcite for other interesting work .",
    "the topics related to temporal and spatial synchronization of the cellular machinery are still hotly debated and present work might offer some understanding of these phenomena .",
    "furthermore , thinking from evolutionary perspective , one wonders what is that cells try to optimize by adopting highly structured geometry ?",
    "evolutionary process occurred in two stages : the chemical evolution  @xcite , which lead to emergence of organic molecules necessary for synthesis of proteins and anything alive , followed by biological evolution  @xcite , a process which started after emergence of the first living cell .",
    "fairly little has been done in understanding the role of geometry and spatial organization played in the evolution process .",
    "there is already some pioneering work in this area  @xcite .",
    "present study could impact some progress in this direction .",
    "besides the topics discussed , the question of interplay between geometry and reaction scheme is relevant to a number of disciplines .",
    "the chemical engineering and biotechnology are typical examples . in general",
    ", there is a tendency to move away from bulk situation where volumes are large and reactants many , towards more exotic regime where reaction volumes are small and structured and number of reactants relatively few .",
    "the interesting experimental work on these topics can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first set of references deals with reactions in liposome networks , and second set addresses the situation where a number of perfectly stirred reactors is connected by tubes .",
    "the exchange of chemicals through tubes is driven by pumps .",
    "the work done in here is relevant to both of these studies .    the particular model proposed here is influenced by several lines of research .",
    "the setup of the reaction schemes is inspired by the work done on prebiotic evolution , genome - based evolution and random reaction networks  @xcite , and diffusion - controlled reactions in bulk phase  @xcite and in restricted geometries  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical setup of the model is motivated by the experimental studies given in  @xcite and theoretical study of reaction - diffusion neuron and enzymatic neuron  @xcite .",
    "the situation considered here is radically different from the bulk studies .",
    "the goal is to mimic particular aspect of the cell environment where reactions happen in the specific regions of space and reactants move among these regions .",
    "the simplest way of achieving such a setup is to consider chemical reactions in containers that are connected by tubes .",
    "figure  [ network ] shows one possible example .",
    "reactants can move from container to another along tubes .",
    "thus , the compartmentalization is build into the model in the simplest possible way .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that containers are small in size so that the number of reactants in each container is also small .",
    "such setup inevitably leads to fluctuations , and chemical kinetics becomes noisy , as is usual the case in the living cell .    for simplicity reasons , the details , both of the chemical reactions and transport , are neglected to a large extent .",
    "it is assumed that reactants are point like objects with no structure .",
    "what is studied here can be classified as artificial chemistry  @xcite .",
    "the two most important time scales are traced in the model .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath1 describes how fast molecules react in containers .",
    "the transport rate @xmath2 governs exchange of chemicals among containers .",
    "it is assumed that diffusion is the dominant mechanism of particle transport and this is reasonably good approximation for the living cell .",
    "@xcite naturally , there are exceptions to this rule , e.g. transport of molecules by kinesin along microtubule in the cell , but such cases are not going to be considered here . for discussion of reaction - diffusion systems in biology",
    "please see ref .",
    "@xcite .    how to compare chemical reactions in a compact and structure geometries depicted in fig .",
    "[ network ] [ panels ( a ) and ( b ) ] ? naturally , the most obvious way would be to run chemical dynamics directly on structures depicted in panels ( a ) and ( b ) and try to trace differences .",
    "however , it will be shown that this can also be done by studying kinetics in network like geometry depicted in panel ( c ) , but such strategy has to be implemented carefully .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ network ] is a very rough representation of structured geometry in panel ( b ) .",
    "however , there is no apparent similarity between structures shown in panels ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "nevertheless , the network structure in ( c ) contains ( a ) and ( b ) as special cases .",
    "for example , when @xmath3 the reaction dynamics occurring in the network depicted in panel ( c ) should exhibit roughly the same features as the reaction dynamics running in the structured geometry depicted in panel ( b ) .",
    "furthermore , when transport rate dominates all other processes in the system , @xmath4 , same should hold for ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "also , in such a case , @xmath2 should be much larger than any other reaction rate that might enter due to the effects of catalysis .",
    "thus , in order to gain some understanding of differences between ( a ) and ( b ) one simply has to study variations of a reaction dynamics in the network like structure ( c ) as transport rate changes from @xmath3 towards @xmath4 .",
    "the type of the analysis used is largely static .",
    "to understand in which ways particular shape of the reaction volume influences chemical kinetics ( and vise versa ) a large number of chemical reactions will be analyzed and their performance compared .",
    "the set of reactions and geometries chosen form an ensemble @xmath5 where elements in ensemble are pairs @xmath6 .",
    "the element @xmath7 will be referred to as an _",
    "organism_.    two ensembles are distinguished .",
    "in the first case , the reaction scheme is kept fixed , while the geometry of the network is allowed to change .",
    "this type of ensemble will be referred to as the geometry on the ( fixed ) reaction ensemble ( gore ) .",
    "the geometries are different and they are sampled by changing size of the containers and length of the tubes . in the second case",
    "the geometry of the network is kept fixed , while the reaction scheme is subject to a change .",
    "this type of the ensemble will be referred to as the reaction on the ( fixed ) geometry ensemble ( roge ) . in this work",
    "most of the attention is on the roge ensemble .    what is the measure of the good performance for a chemical reaction ?",
    "in here , focus will be on the time related issues such as the length of catalytic cycles .",
    "the importance of the timing in the intra cellular process has been discussed by volkenstein @xcite : ` the most important role in ontogeny is played by time factors , i.e. the time relations in the synthesis of various proteins and the formation of various cells and tissues .",
    "even small changes in the timetable lead to considerable morphological alternations ... ' .",
    "the setup presented here allows for consideration of other performance criteria but these are omitted due to the simplicity reasons .",
    "the time needed for a reaction to finish , @xmath8 , is a stochastic variable and for a given reaction scheme and topology it will have well defined distribution function @xmath9 : the probability that reaction finished within the time interval @xmath10 $ ] is given by @xmath11 . all information",
    "about reaction timing is hidden in the distribution function @xmath9 . in practise , it is very hard to find @xmath9 for general reaction scheme and geometry . also , amount of information contained in @xmath9 is too large .",
    "it is more fruitful to characterize @xmath9 in terms of few variables and in this work we use two : the average time needed for reaction to complete @xmath12 and the variance @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "in such a way it is possible to asses how _",
    "fast _ reaction happens and how _ noisy _ it is .",
    "once performance criteria are quantified one faces optimization problem of finding the best performer in a given ensemble @xmath15 . in principle",
    ", the best performer will be the organism that exhibits smallest value for @xmath16 .",
    "two strategies are used to find such organism .",
    "first , one simply generates full ensemble , measures performance of each element , and sorts performance at the end . however , when number of elements in such ensemble is large another optimization method has to be used .",
    "for example , when there is a need for that , one can use a method described in refs .",
    "this optimization method mimics process of evolution and belongs to the class of genetic optimization algorithms .",
    "the terms evolution and optimization will be used interchangeably through out the text .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] the reaction - diffusion model is defined in detail , and in section  [ sec : dynamics ] overview of the methods for solving the master equation is given .",
    "the method of doing a computer simulation is reviewed first .",
    "the method of finding moments of the time length of the catalytic cycles is discussed in detail in the next section  [ sec : moment_method ] .",
    "few simple reactions are discussed in section  [ sec : roge1 ] where it is shown how to compare vastly different reaction schemes .",
    "section  [ sec : roge2 ] contains analysis of roge ensemble made from two container network , two particle types , all possible reactions , and full set of inject - task patterns .",
    "conclusions and outlook are given in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the reaction - diffusion model is defined as follows .",
    "consider the set of containers @xmath17 connected in a particular way by tubes with lengths @xmath18 ; @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible that some containers are not connected .",
    "example of such structure is given in fig .",
    "the containers harbor molecules @xmath20 ; @xmath21 .",
    "molecules are allowed to react only when in the same container ( provided there is a reaction they participate in ) .",
    "molecule @xmath20 moves from the container @xmath17 to the container @xmath22 with a rate @xmath23 .",
    "please note that the expression for the transport rate is diagonal in the particle index @xmath24 ( there is no change of particles while being transported ) .",
    "this assumption could be easily relaxed . for simplicity reasons it is assumed that @xmath25 if the link between container @xmath26 and @xmath27 exists , otherwise @xmath28 .",
    "links are non - directional and transport rates are same for all particles , i.e. @xmath29",
    ". please note that the regular lattice is a special case of this very general model .",
    "structures like these can be found in the interior of the living cells .",
    "mapping is not exact , but there is a rough similarity .    by assumption , the reactions only occur in the containers and not in the tubes , and reactants mix well in the containers .",
    "tubes serve only as connectors of regions where reactions happen . with assumptions at hand , to describe system at any time instant , it is sufficient to track number of particles in each container .",
    "this greatly simplifies calculations .",
    "conformation of the system @xmath30 is specified as a occupancy of the containers , @xmath31 where vectors @xmath32 @xmath33 describe particle content of each container , @xmath34 with @xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",
    "system makes random transitions between various configurations . a configuration of the system , @xmath30 , changes when either reaction or transport occur .    for computational convenience ,",
    "the very simple type of a reaction scheme will be considered , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is understood to influence conversion of @xmath20 to @xmath39 either as catalyst ( @xmath40 ) or suppressor ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "all reactions that are allowed are assumed to have same reaction rate @xmath1 .",
    "the reaction graph is specified by the reactivity matrix @xmath42 . if reaction @xmath43 is allowed @xmath44 and equals zero otherwise .",
    "the reaction graph is directed and matrix @xmath42 is not necessarily symmetric .",
    "the effect of catalyst or suppressor are modeled as follows .",
    "the bare reaction rate @xmath1 may be modified by the presence of other reactants in the container @xmath17 .",
    "it is assumed that each reaction can have at most one catalyst or suppressor . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible that one particle is catalyst ( or suppressor ) for more than one reaction . for programming purposes it is sufficient to use array @xmath45 if @xmath38 is catalyst ( @xmath40 ) or suppressor ( @xmath41 ) for @xmath43 reaction .",
    "@xmath46 indicates that reaction does not have catalyst nor suppressor .",
    "also , it is assumed that the effects of the catalysis are strongly enhanced .",
    "if there is some catalysis going on , it completely dominates reaction scheme . using these assumptions the reaction rate for the reaction @xmath43 in the container @xmath17",
    "is given by @xmath47 @xmath48 is a kronecker delta - function , @xmath49 denotes catalysis enhancement factor , and @xmath50 .",
    "equation  ( [ catalysis ] ) is self explanatory for the exception of possibly one term that we proceed to discuss .",
    "the condition @xmath51 ensures that there is no self catalysis for the reaction of the type @xmath52 when there is only one @xmath20 present in the container .",
    "one needs at least two @xmath20 in order to fell catalytic influence of @xmath20 on the reaction given in ( [ selfcat ] ) .",
    "the particular type of the reaction schemes considered here ( [ reaction ] ) is inspired by chemical processes in the living cell .",
    "it is often that by action of enzymes certain input set of chemicals is converted into output molecules by series of intermediate reactions .",
    "it is exactly this aspect of cellular machinery which this scheme tries to capture in the most simple way .",
    "the most general reaction graph one can consider is shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] .",
    "the graph indicates that cell machinery converts molecules @xmath53 into molecules @xmath54 .",
    "the shaded area in the middle denotes intermediate reaction steps that involve arbitrary set of reactions between molecules already shown in the graph .",
    "an additional particle types may appear in the shaded region .",
    "it is possible to define the speed of a reaction as the time needed for the predetermined set of output molecules @xmath54 to appear for the first time , provided only the input molecules were present initially in the system .",
    "how this idea is implemented is shown bellow .",
    "in addition to reaction scheme given in eq .",
    "( [ reaction ] ) two quantities are specified .",
    "first , at @xmath55 a certain number of particles is injected into the system in various containers .",
    "the list of the particles injected is specified by the vector @xmath56 in the course of time the injected set of particles will be transformed into something else .",
    "second , the vector @xmath57 specifies tasks that have to be achieved .",
    "for example , @xmath58 indicates that goal is to synthesize @xmath59 molecules of the type @xmath20 in the container @xmath17 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath60 indicates that the number of particles @xmath20 in the container @xmath17 is not traced . the maximum number of tasks is given by @xmath61 , though not all tasks need to be monitored . also , the cases where task is achieved trivially at @xmath55 are forbidden and additional restriction is set upon components of @xmath62 and @xmath63 : if task is traced one has @xmath58 . in such case ,",
    "the condition @xmath64 must hold .    to make a notation easier , it is convenient to eliminate the elements from @xmath65 and @xmath66 that are zero and write @xmath67 where @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , only contain list of molecules injected , and tasks that are actually monitored .",
    "it is clear that @xmath68 .",
    "every time a certain task is accomplished the time when this happens is stored .",
    "these times are arranged in the vector @xmath69 and there is a one to one correspondence between the elements of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "once the task is achieved molecules that were used to accomplish it are removed from the system .",
    "this consideration is motivated by the character of the real processes in the living cell .",
    "if certain number of molecules are needed at specific place , once arriving there , these molecules will be consumed by other biochemical processes in the living cell .",
    "the vector @xmath72 is a stochastic variable and can be described in terms of the distribution function @xmath73 . in practise , it is very hard to obtain full distribution function and it is more convenient to use first two moments , the average @xmath74 and the variance @xmath75 in addition , one could also include moments of the type @xmath76 @xmath77 but these will be not considered .    the quadruple consisting of particular reaction scheme ( @xmath1 , @xmath78 , @xmath42 and @xmath79 ) , network geometry ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) , inject pattern @xmath62 , and list of tasks monitored @xmath63 , will be referred to as an _  organism_. the organism can be seen as the entity that has to transform a certain number of chemicals into a set of molecules that have to be synthesized at certain places , utilizing available reaction scheme and geometry . in the following sections various organisms will be classified according to the criteria",
    "how fast they achieve certain list of tasks ( see .",
    "eq .  [ avtau ] ) . in principle , it is possible to make classification with regard to how noisy performance is ( see eq .",
    "[ sigma ] ) , but this type of classification is left for future studies .",
    "the dynamics of the system defined in the previous section is stochastic and from the rules discussed one can derive a master equation that describes the time evolution of the occupation probabilities @xmath80 , @xmath81 where here and in the following dot over symbol denotes time derivative .",
    "the reaction rates @xmath82 describing transition @xmath83 can be easily calculated from the definition of the model . in general , it is very hard to solve the equation  ( [ meq ] ) . in here , two strategies are use to solve it .",
    "first strategy is based on a simulation method .",
    "this is a straight forward approach . in the second instance",
    "a set of equations is derived that specifies first , second , and possibly higher moments of the @xmath84 .",
    "both strategies are implemented into a computer program .",
    "* computer simulation : * the master equation ( [ meq ] ) is solved by using minimal process algorithm suggested by gillespie  @xcite .",
    "given that the system is in a certain configuration , one can calculate distribution of waiting time for the next process to happen .",
    "time is updated by amount of waiting @xmath85 .",
    "process is chosen randomly according to weight given by corresponding rates for each process .",
    "for problem at hand a linear selection algorithm is used .",
    "given that at the time @xmath86 the system was in the conformation @xmath87 specified in ( [ vecc ] ) , following processes can happen .",
    "transport of particle @xmath20 from @xmath17 to @xmath22 occurs with rates @xmath88 or reactions within containers with rates @xmath89 one also needs the total reaction rate , @xmath90 which is used to calculate the time update @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a random number drawn uniformly from the interval @xmath93 .",
    "the probabilities for process to happen are given by @xmath94 a process is chosen using the linear selection algorithm .",
    "first , a new random number @xmath95 is drawn .",
    "after that , the cumulant probabilities are calculated through loop over all processes .",
    "the loop is stopped when the cumulant probability exceeds @xmath95 and the last process for which this happened is executed .",
    "* moment method : * this method relies on the matrix representation of the master equation ( [ meq ] ) and can not be used to treat cases with large number of containers and particle types .",
    "however , the method is exact and should be used when there are enough computation resources .",
    "the method is developed in the following section .",
    "it will be shown how to calculate moments of the individual components of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the more complicated moments , e.g. @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , could be also evaluated using technique presented in this section , but such moments will not be considered . the focus in on the moments that are obtained through @xmath103 where @xmath104 denotes integrated distribution function for task @xmath105 given by @xmath106 please note that accomplishment of each individual task is influenced by presence of others since the particles can vanish upon accomplishment of various tasks .",
    "this is the reason why integrated distribution function @xmath104 contains both index of the task that statistics is sought for ( @xmath107 ) and full list of tasks being monitored ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "we focus on the particular case of @xmath211 where goal is to synthesize two b molecules in the container @xmath185 . due to the initial presence of molecule",

    "the antagonistic catalytic influences just discussed are best handled in a network like geometry . in such a case the synthesis of the molecules can be done in a separate containers . with two containers there is always a chance that antagonistic influences will be reduced .",

    "the reaction of organisms @xmath219 is such that it is possible that tasks are not accomplished .",
    "for example , all a molecules can be converted to b before task [ 2a]- [ ]  in @xmath185 is accomplished .",
    "once this happens synthesis of a s in @xmath185 will never occur since back reaction @xmath180 is absent .",
    "very likely , from biological point of view there is no advantage basing survival on a reaction that sometimes fails , i.e. using reaction similar to the one contained in @xmath217 .",
    "nevertheless , there might be constraints that could enforce presence of such reaction .",
    "for example , the number of molecules in nature is large but limited .",
    "living organisms have to use what is available . in the lack of alternatives",
    "it might be necessary for the intra cellular machinery to use reaction that sometimes fails . but leaving such discussions aside , the only point emphasized here is that organism @xmath217 draws most benefit from the network like structure .    interestingly ,",
    "this type of organism remains winner in the classes @xmath220 and @xmath221 with @xmath222 and @xmath223 , see table  [ tab : best ] , organisms @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",

    "another example , can be obtained from comparison of @xmath217 with @xmath232 .",

    "a priori , the organism @xmath232 could be considered to have @xmath199 , however this is not the case .",
    "the actual value for @xmath233 is ( lot ) larger than one .    in summary",
    ", the table  [ tab : best ] shows a couple of interesting features .",
    "first , one can see that when maximum allowed number of particles in the system increases new effects appear .",
    "it is impossible to predict winner in each class before calculation is done .",
    "second , there is also a large sensitivity on inject and task patterns .",
    "slight alternation of these patterns can lead to drastic changes in performance criteria @xmath168 .",
    "we introduced what we might call a generic model for study of chemical reactions in structured spaces , based on a simple way of incorporating interplay between transport , chemical reactions , and geometry .",
    "a number of different chemical reactions were studied and their performance compared in various ways .",
    "the main idea is to see how the reaction processes behave when geometry changes from compact open space towards the cell like environment that is more structured . in order to be able to analyze large number of reactions ,",
    "relatively simple model was used in order to reduce computational time .",
    "following simplifications were made .    as a model of structured space we used a network consisting of containers connected by tubes .",
    "such setup captures the most important geometrical aspects of the problem .",
    "there are compact regions in space that reactants can explore and react within .",
    "these regions are connected to each other and exchange chemicals .",
    "in such a way the two most important processes are clearly separated , the local dynamics within container , and the transport among containers .",
    "this is pretty much how living cell operates .",
    "in such a way one can capture most important geometrical aspects of the cell interior .",
    "the reaction scheme considered is rather crude .",
    "dynamics within container , however complicated it may be , is projected onto a relatively low number of degrees of freedom , the number of particles in each container .",
    "the reaction rate @xmath1 describes how fast reactions happen .",
    "the description in terms of number of particles becomes more and more valid when size of the reaction volume is reduced and number of reactants few  @xcite .",
    "it is exactly this limit that we focussed on .",
    "the transport between containers was modeled in simplest possible way by using the effective transport rate @xmath2 .",
    "it was assumed that transport rate is same for any pair of containers , and type of particles .",
    "this assumption could be easily relaxed .",
    "clearly , when tubes are long , the number of particles in each container decays non - exponentially and the transport process can not be described by using a transport rate .",
    "but such effects are not considered here .",
    "thus , only two parameters are used to describe dynamics , the reaction rate @xmath1 and transport rate @xmath2 .",
    "there are several advantages in doing so , but the most important one is that reactions and transport are clearly separated , and it is easier to understand how they influence each other . despite apparent simplicity ,",
    "the model studied in here captures all essential features of the problem .",
    "should there be need for that one can make the model more realistic , but we refrain from this at the moment .",
    "which types of chemical reactions draw most benefit from structured spaces ? in an attempt to answer this question two schemes were formulated . in roge scheme one explores variety of chemical reactions while spatial structure ( geometry ) is kept fixed .",
    "it is the other way around for gore scheme . at the moment",
    "roge scheme is studied in a lot more detail .",
    "the study of gore ensemble will be left for the future work .",
    "the main findings of this work are discussed bellow .    since dynamics is stochastic one needs probabilistic description of the system , and in order to perform analysis of any chemical reaction one has to solve corresponding master equation that describes statistics of events .",
    "two techniques for doing this were used .",
    "first , the computer simulation is a straight forward way to analyze master equation ( discussed in section  [ sec : dynamics ] ) .",
    "this technique is not that accurate due to the stochastic spread of data .",
    "one needs unrealistically large number of runs in order to gain reasonable accuracy in @xmath168 . in here , a novel method of analyzing chemical reaction was developed , with emphasis on the first passage time ( see section  [ sec : moment_method ] ) .",
    "this method relies on a matrix representation of the master equation . in principle , it is exact up to the numerical errors in carrying out matrix manipulations , such as finding inverses , multiplying matrix with vector etc .",
    "in here we developed a equation that describes first passage time distribution function for achieving set of tasks . from this equation",
    "one can easily obtain all moments of distribution function and calculate average execution time for reaction and its variance .",
    "it is not so easy to compare two vastly different chemical reactions .",
    "a method for doing this was discussed in section  [ sec : roge1 ] .",
    "there are some obvious difficulties when doing comparison .",
    "for example , one might need to compare a situation where number of molecular types involved in reactions are completely different .",
    "also , spatial structures need not be the same , e.g. there might be a need to compare two vastly different network structures . in order to overcome these difficulties one has to use a measure of relative performance .",
    "for example , in the case of a roge ensemble the execution time for given reaction was compared when geometry is stretched ( transport occurs with rate @xmath197 ) and compact ( transport with rate @xmath196 where @xmath198 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath168 of the magnitude of the execution times @xmath193 and @xmath194 for stretched ( network ) and compact geometry is a rough estimate of how well reaction performs in a network like geometry . instead of comparing organisms",
    "directly one compares values @xmath234 .",
    "thus , the single variable @xmath168 is sufficient to determine whether a reaction ( organism ) runs best on the network like ( @xmath199 ) or the compact geometry ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath168 was used to classify performance of various organisms in the geometry consisting of two containers connected by tube , with main findings summarized in fig .",
    "[ histogram ] and table  [ tab : best ] .",
    "\\(1 ) it is obvious that intuition does not help much .",
    "one really has to do numerical analysis in order to extract best performer in a given class .",
    "for example , the character of best performer changes quite a bit when number of particles in the system varies .",
    "the structure of the winning organism in the first row of table changes in a rather unpredictable manner as upper limit to the total number of particles in the system increases from 2 to 5 . also , the performance is extremely sensitive to the details of inject and task patterns .",
    "it is interesting to speculate whether such sensitivity on total particle number , inject and task patterns is exploited in the intra cellular machinery .",
    "we developed a quantitative method to judge on such effects .",
    "\\(2 ) the role of reactions with positive and negative catalytic influence is symmetric . roughly , they occur equally often in the organisms that perform well in network like geometries with @xmath199 .",
    "interestingly enough , same holds for opposite range with @xmath200 . from fig .",
    "[ histogram ] one can see that positive and negative areas are roughly equal in magnitude , both in the @xmath199 and @xmath200 regions . thus , there are reactions of the suppressor type that run better in compact geometries , and the other way around .",
    "there are also reactions with solely positive catalytic influence that run faster in network like geometry .",
    "but these findings are the not the only ones that are counterintuitive .",
    "it is also surprising that in the region @xmath235 reactions with solely positive catalytic influence dominate .",
    "\\(3 ) reaction schemes containing antagonistic catalytic influences in the intermediate stages of reaction , that slow down the production of the final product , require network like geometry to run fast .",
    "the antagonistic sub - reactions have to isolated and allowed to occur in separate regions of space .",
    "there are two mechanisms that work against each other .",
    "first , the reaction time gets larger since one needs to transport reactants to the regions where damage inflicting sub - reactions must be run in isolation .",
    "second , after being isolated , dangerous sub - reactions happen much faster than when all reactants are mixed and this shortens reaction time .",
    "it is interesting to note that there are large number of cases where isolating misbehaving sub - reactions pays off in faster reaction time .",
    "\\(4 ) in general , antagonistic catalytic influences are hard to identify .",
    "it is hard to judge reaction by itself .",

    "<S> second , tubes connecting containers allow for exchange of chemicals with transport rate @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a way the two most important processes are isolated in the problem , reactions and transport . by varying topology of such network and details of chemical reactions it is possible to gain some understanding of interplay between chemical reactions and transport in structured spaces . </S>",
    "<S> it assumed that the number of reactants in the system is so small that kinetics is noise dominated . </S>",
    "<S> two methods for solving corresponding master equation are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the computer simulation is easy to implement , but leads to the results that are not that accurate . in here </S>",
    "<S> , a method is presented that can be used to calculate average , variance , and higher moments of the time reaction needs to finish . </S>",
    "<S> the method relies on a matrix representation of the master equation and is in principle exact . </S>",
    "<S> it works for an arbitrary reaction scheme and network topology . </S>",
    "<S> a number of different chemical reactions were studied and their performance compared in a various ways . </S>",
    "<S> reactions are grouped into two ensembles , reaction on a fixed geometry ensemble ( roge ) and geometry on a fixed reaction ensemble ( gore ) . </S>",
    "<S> the roge and gore are used to classify reactions in order to gain some understanding of which types of chemical reactions draw most benefit from the structured spaces . </S>",
    "<S> most important findings are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) there is a large number of reactions that run faster in a network like geometry . </S>",
    "<S> such reactions contain antagonistic catalytic influences in the intermediate stages of a reaction scheme that is best dealt with in a network like structure . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) antagonistic catalytic influences are hard to identify since they are strongly connected to the pattern of injected molecules ( inject pattern ) and depend on the choice of molecules that have to be synthesized at the end ( task pattern ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the reaction time depends strongly on the details of the inject and task patterns . </S>"
