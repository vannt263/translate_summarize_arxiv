    "the study of the scalar top quarks is of particular interest , since the lighter stop mass eigenstate is likely to be the lightest scalar quark in a supersymmetric theory .",
    "the mass eigenstates are  and 2  with @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the mixing angle .",
    "we study the experimental possibilities to determine  and  at a high - luminosity  linear collider such as the tesla project  @xcite with polarized @xmath3 and @xmath15 beams .",
    "the simulated production process is @xmath16 with two decay modes @xmath17c and @xmath18b .",
    "a 100% branching fraction in each decay mode is simulated . the first scalar top decay into a c - quark and the lightest neutralino results in a signature of two jets and large missing energy .",
    "the second investigated stop decay mode leads also to large missing energy and further jets from the chargino decay .",
    "the neutralino channel is dominant unless the decay into a chargino is kinematically allowed .",
    "details of the event simulation with sgv  @xcite tuned for a tesla detector  @xcite are given in ref .",
    "the signals and a total of 16 million standard model background events are simulated ( table  [ tab : pre ] ) for @xmath1  fb@xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : point5 ] shows that the bounds on the scalar top mass at 210 gev and @xmath8 increase .",
    "we obtain @xmath19  gev and @xmath10 .",
    "based on the experience from direct searches at lep , the systematic errors on the event selection are less than 1% ; precise investigations require the detailed detector layout and a full simulation .",
    "the stop generator  @xcite has been interfaced with the simdet  @xcite simulation to allow an independent test of the detector simulation and related systematic errors . also with the simdet-4 simulation and",
    "based on an implemented lcfi ccd detector simulation , a preliminary result of the c - tagging performance is presented .",
    "another uncertainty could arise from the luminosity measurement , the measurement of the polarization , and the theoretical uncertainty of the production cross section .",
    "a high - luminosity linear collider with the capability of beam polarization has great potential for precision measurements in the scalar quark sector predicted by supersymmetric theories .",
