    "the recently available measurements of luminosity distances of the type ia supernova ( snia ) as a function of redshift have shown that current universe is in an accelerating phase due to unknown form of repulsive energy @xcite . the most popular candidate for this dark energy",
    "is the cosmological constant .",
    "on the other hand the results of large - scale structure surveys and results of measurements of masses of galaxies give best fit for density parameter for matter @xmath0 @xcite ( for review of cosmological parameters see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . combining data from snia with measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )",
    "radiation , we obtain @xmath1 as the best fit value .",
    "the sum of the densities @xmath2 obtained by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite agrees with value predicted by inflation and suggests that our universe is almost flat on the large scales .",
    "therefore , the assumption of flat model with the cosmological constant is in good agreement with observations .    the acceleration of the universe can be explained in two - fold manner . in first approach",
    "it is postulated that there is some unknown exotic matter which violates the strong energy condition @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pressure and @xmath5 is the energy density of perfect fluid .",
    "this form of matter is called dark energy . in the past few years",
    "different scalar field models like quintessence and more recently the tachyonic scalar field have been conjectured for modeling the dark energy in terms of sub - negative pressure @xmath6 . a scalar field with super - negative pressure @xmath7 called a phantom field",
    "can formally be obtained by switching the sign of the kinetic energy in the lagrangian for a standard scalar field .",
    "for example in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model the phantom field minimally coupled to a gravity field leads to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the phantom potential .",
    "such a field was called the phantom field by caldwell @xcite who proposed it as a possible explanation of the observed acceleration of the current universe when @xmath12 .",
    "note that a coupling to gravity in the quintessence models was also explored @xcite .",
    "the second approach called the cardassian expansion scenario has recently been proposed by freese and lewis @xcite as an alternative to dark energy in order to explain the current accelerated expansion of the universe . in this scenario universe",
    "is flat and matter dominated but the standard frw dynamics is modified by the presence of an additional term @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hubble parameter ; and @xmath16 is the scale factor . however , let us note that this additional term can be interpreted as a phantom field modelled by the equation of state @xmath17 \\rho$ ] , where @xmath18 . therefore for dust matter",
    "we obtain @xmath19 , and @xmath20 leads to the phantom field .",
    "the phantom scalar field can also be motivated from s - brane in string theory @xcite .",
    "the non - canonical kinetic energy also occurs in higher - order theories of gravity and super - gravity @xcite . at first ,",
    "phantom fields were introduced by bulk viscosity effects which can be present in frw cosmology .",
    "they are equivalent to effective pressure @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "it is because dissipation in general relativity is connected ( in contrast to friction in classical mechanics ) with creation of the energy in the expanding universe by the negative pressure contribution @xcite .    without making some specific assumptions on @xmath23 it very difficult to constrain it from the snia data @xcite . because the astronomical observations do not seem to exclude the phantom fields which violate the weak energy condition , it is interesting to investigate the theoretical possibility to describe dark energy in terms of a phantom field @xcite .",
    "the cardassian expansion with @xmath20 which can be interpreted as the phantom fluid effect is also statistically admissible from snia data observations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we ask what kind of dynamics can be expected from the frw model with phantom field .",
    "it is well known that the standard frw model reveals some complex dynamics .",
    "the detailed studies gave us a deeper understanding of dynamical complexity and chaos in cosmological models and resulted in conclusion that complex behavior depends on the choice of a time parameterization or a lapse function in general relativity @xcite .",
    "castagnino et al .",
    "@xcite showed that dynamics of closed frw models with conformally coupled massive scalar field is not chaotic if considered in the cosmological time .",
    "they showed that for all initial conditions the universe will collapse in finite time and then conclude that there is no chaos in the model . in their work the monotonously growing function is defined along a trajectory which diverge at infinity for arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "the same model was analyzed in the conformal time by calzetta and hasi @xcite who presented the existence of chaotic behavior of trajectories in the phase space .",
    "for the cosmological frw model with a scalar field the kinetic energy form is indefinite , therefore , the domain admissible for motion is @xmath24 .",
    "the similar situation happens in the bianchi ix in which , as it was proved by cushman and sniatycki @xcite , trajectories have no recurrence property .",
    "the standard methods of chaos investigation can be also applied to the wide class of a relativistic system @xcite .",
    "motter and letelier @xcite explained that this contradiction in the results is obtained because the system under consideration is non - integrable .",
    "therefore we can speak about complex dynamics in terms of non - integrability rather than deterministic chaos .",
    "the significant feature is that non - integrability is an invariant evidence of dynamical complexity in general relativity and cosmology @xcite .",
    "there are different motivations to study noningrability in general relativity and cosmology .",
    "one reason is the possible physical implications of existence of complexity in the systems which for example could help to explain the formation of structures .",
    "another reason is to develop suitable tools to study relativistic system .",
    "the next motivation is to understand the ultimate implication of the time reparameterization .    for the frw model with phantom",
    "it can be shown that there is a monotonous function along its trajectories and it is not possible to obtain the lyapunov exponents or construct the poincar sections .",
    "therefore we turn to study of non - integrability of the phantom system and set it in a much stronger form by proving that the system does not possesses any additional and independent of hamiltonian first integrals , which are in the form of analytic or meromorphic functions . of course , it is not the evidence of sensitive dependence of solution on a small change of initial conditions .",
    "however , it is the possible evidence of complexity of dynamical behavior formulated in an invariant way .",
    "we study non - integrability in the frw model with phantom fields and find that non - integrability is a generic feature of this model and favors rather non - analytical forms of the equation of state .",
    "it is useful to distinguish between solvability and integrability .",
    "while integrability is intrinsic property of the system which impose the constraints on the solutions in the phase space , the solvability is related to the existence of closed form solutions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on first integrals rather than solutions of a system .",
    "we study nonintegrability instead of chaos because this criterion is invariant with respect to time reparameterization .",
    "note that while this program of nonintegrability investigation was explicitly formulated by motter and letelier @xcite , this idea was materialized in papers by maciejewski and szydlowski @xcite .",
    "maciejewski and szydlowski also showed that the bianchi viii and ix are noningrable in the sense of non - existence of additional analytic first integrals @xcite and that the bianchi viii model is non - integrable in the sense of nonexistence of mereomorphic first integrals @xcite .",
    "the mereomorphic function possesses only poles as its singularities ; roughly speaking it is the quotient of analytic functions .",
    "the latter method is used in this paper .",
    "ziglin proved independently non - integrability of frw closed model with scalar field in the sense of nonexistence of additional mereomorphic first integrals @xcite . in turn",
    "morales ruiz and ramis proved nonintegrability of the bianchi ix in the same sense @xcite .    for comparison",
    "we consider the frw model with phantom given by the barotropic equation of state which violates the weak energy condition .",
    "we obtain that this model is integrable in contrast to the previous treatment of phantom cosmology . assuming the barotropic form of the equation of state for the phantom model we obtain the integrable dynamics at very beginning .",
    "we assume the model with frw geometry , i.e. , the line element has the form @xmath25 , \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 @xmath27 is the curvature index , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are comoving coordinates , @xmath30 stands for the conformal time such that @xmath31 .",
    "it is also assumed that a source of gravity is the phantom scalar field @xmath32 with a generic coupling to gravity .",
    "the gravitational dynamics is described by the standard einstein - hilbert action @xmath33 where @xmath34 ; for simplicity and without loss of generality we assume @xmath35 .",
    "the action for the matter source is @xmath36 let us note that the formal sign of @xmath37 is opposite to that which describes the standard scalar field as a source of gravity , where @xmath38 is a scalar field potential .",
    "we assume @xmath39 and that conformal volume @xmath40 over the spatial 3-hypersurface is a unit .",
    "@xmath22 is a coupling constant of scalar field to the ricci scalar @xmath41    if we have the minimally coupled scalar field then @xmath42 . we assume a non - minimal coupling of the scalar field @xmath43 .",
    "the dynamical equation for phantom cosmology in which the phantom field is modelled by the scalar field with an opposite sign of the kinetic term in action can be obtained from the variational principle @xmath44 . after dropping the full derivatives with respect to the conformal time we obtain the dynamical equation for phantom cosmology from variation @xmath45 as well as the dynamical equation for field from variation @xmath46 @xmath47",
    "it can be shown that for any value of @xmath22 the phantom behaves like some perfect fluid with the effective energy @xmath48 and the pressure @xmath49 in the form which determines the equation of state factor @xmath50 -\\xi \\psi^{2}(2\\dot{h}+3h^{2})}{-\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\psi}^{2}+u(\\psi ) + 3\\xi h[h\\psi^{2}+(\\psi^{2})\\dot{\\ } ] }   \\equiv \\frac{p_{\\psi}}{\\rho_{\\psi}}. \\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] formula ( [ eq:8 ] ) differs from its counterpart for the standard scalar field @xcite by the presence of a negative sign in front of the term @xmath51 .",
    "the second derivative @xmath52 in the expression for the pressure in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) can be eliminated and then we obtain @xmath53 of course such perfect fluid which mimics the phantom field satisfies the conservation equation @xmath54 we can see that complexity of dynamical equation should manifest by complexity of @xmath55 .",
    "let us consider the frw quintessential dynamics with some effective energy density @xmath48 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) . by the quintessence",
    "we usually understand models with dark energy consisting of a dynamical cosmic scalar field .",
    "this dynamics can be reduced to the form like of a particle in a one - dimensional potential @xcite and the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath56 the trajectories of the system lie on the zero energy level for flat and vacuum models . note that if we additionally postulate the presence of radiation matter for which @xmath57 then it is equivalent to consider the hamiltonian on the level @xmath58 .",
    "of course the division on kinetic and potential parts has only a conventional character and we can always translate the term containing @xmath51 into a kinetic term .",
    "let us consider now both case of conformally and minimally coupled phantom fields .",
    "for conformally coupled phantom fields we put @xmath59 and rescale the field @xmath60 .",
    "then the energy function takes the following form for simple mechanical system with a natural lagrangian function @xmath61 @xmath62 in contrast to the frw model with conformally coupled scalar field the kinetic energy form is positive definite like for classical mechanical systems . the general hamiltonian which represents the special case of two coupled non - harmonic oscillators system is @xmath63",
    "where @xmath64,@xmath65,@xmath66,@xmath67 , and @xmath68 are constants .      for minimally coupled phantom fields ( @xmath42 ) the function of energy takes the form @xmath69 where",
    "@xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 is assumed .",
    "this time we parameterize the dynamics by taking variable @xmath32 in the original cosmological time and the lagrangian function takes the following form @xmath75 where the prime denotes the differentiation with respect to the cosmological time parameter @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "for a given hamiltonian system , it is difficult to show that the system under consideration is non - integrable . in general , there are two formulations of necessary conditions for the integrability presented by ziglin @xcite and morales - ruiz and ramis @xcite .",
    "both approaches base on a deep connection between properties of solutions in an enlarged complex time plane and the existence of first integrals .",
    "this idea originates from works of kovalevskaya and lyapunov .",
    "let us study the general case of the hamiltonian system describing the conformally coupled phantom field in the frw model of the universe .",
    "we have @xmath79 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this hamiltonian has the natural form in which the potential is a homogeneous function of degree four with respect to both variables @xmath16 , @xmath86 .    from the point of view of complex dynamical behavior",
    "it is useful to distinguish from hamiltonian ( [ eq:17 ] ) with @xmath87 .",
    "this case is interesting because of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the poincar section in this case can be obtained as well as the lyapunov exponents . in this model",
    "the chaotic behavior is present .",
    "in other cases we can define by analogy to castagnino et al .",
    "@xcite the monotonic function along trajectories .",
    "from this fact we obtain that trajectories escape to infinity and the system has no recurrence property which guarantee the topological transitivity ( the standard chaos indicators can not be obtained ) .",
    "motter and letelier argued that the cosmological systems with scalar fields are non - chaotic but complex in the sense of non - integrability @xcite .",
    "moreover the non - integrability is an invariant property of system under the coordinate change .    in the second distinguished case",
    "the complexity has the same character , and we apply the some tools to confirm the liouville non - integrability of this system .",
    "the liouville integrability of the hamiltonian system means that there is as many functionally independent functions which are in involution ( poisson brackets vanish ) as is the dimension of the system .",
    "now we consider the problem of non - integrability in both cases .",
    "the non - integrability of the non - flat first case with the spontaneous symmetry breaking was investigated by ziglin ( @xmath88  the yang - mills potential ) @xcite . in turn",
    ", we apply the ziglin and morales - ruiz and ramis methods to flat phantom models with conformally coupled scalar fields with arbitrary parameters .",
    "the integrability of hamiltonian systems with a natural lagrangian was analyzed in details by yoshida @xcite in the framework of ziglin s approach .",
    "later yoshida s results were sharpened by morales - ruiz and ramis @xcite .",
    "note that we applied the morales - ruiz and ramis result to system ( [ eq:17 ] ) , but with the indefinite kinetic energy form @xmath89 .",
    "the counterpart of hamiltonian ( [ eq:17 ] ) for a standard scalar field can be obtained after the canonical transformation of variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 then of course @xmath92 .",
    "however , in this case the phase space is complex .",
    "moreover , trajectories have no recurrence property which guarantee the topological transitivity , which an essential element of the standard understanding of chaos .",
    "the fundamental papers of ziglin @xcite gave the formulation of a very basic theorem about non - integrability of analytic hamiltonian systems .",
    "the ziglin idea connects properties of solutions on a complex time plane and the existence of first integrals .",
    "this approach takes its origins in works of kovalevskaya and lyapunov .",
    "the yoshida criterion is presented in appendix .",
    "we apply this criterion to the analyzed system",
    ". then the equation @xmath93 has the following solutions @xmath94 the integrability indices for this points are @xmath95 and @xmath96 thus , from the yoshida criterion follows that if there exists @xmath97 such that @xmath98 then system ( [ eq:17 ] ) has no additional meromorphic first integral that is functionally independent of @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , our previous application of the morales - ruiz and ramis result to the considered system gives that if we introduce quantities ( [ eq : li ] ) and three discrete sets @xmath100\\ |\\ p \\in",

    "therefore , only for certain values of model parameters the phantom cosmology is integrable .",
    "we can conclude that the liouville non - integrability is the generic property of the system .",
    "if we consider a non - flat model then the effects of curvature are negligible near the singularity and the considered case describes a generic situation . in this way the phantoms give rise to the complex dynamics in the sense of non - existence of a sufficient number of independent first integrals . as a consequence , we can express some scepticism about prediction for the equation of state factor @xmath23 in the presence of the phantom component of dark energy .",
    "our conclusion is that in a generic case the phantom scalar field can produce the complex behavior .",
    "the complexity of dynamics is formulated in terms of non - integrability ( i.e. , non - existence of an additional first integral ) because a standard understanding of chaos has no significant physical meaning in the context of a gauge freedom in the choice of a lapse function ( time parameterization ) .",
    "beck @xcite proposed an interesting idea that stochastically quantized scalar fields can offer some solution to the cosmological coincidence problem of @xmath102 . in this approach",
    "the chaotic fields have a classical equation of state close to @xmath103 , i.e. , that the chaotic fields naturally generate a small cosmological constant .",
    "it is possible that phantoms are just a phenomenological description of this situation on a purely classical level .",
    "let us also note that regular behavior of dynamics in phantom cosmology can appear to be different from the considered types of potentials @xcite but @xmath104 is the simplest one in which this phenomenon occurs",
    ". moreover it can only appear if we treat phantom energy in terms of a single scalar field .",
    "it is well - known that for given evolution of the model it is possible to construct a potential for a minimally coupled scalar field which would reproduce this cosmological evolution @xcite . sometimes it is possible to find the explicit form of scalar field potential can reproduce the evolution arising in some perfect fluid cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the very different picture is found , if we consider phantom energy as a some kind of perfect fluid with super - negative pressure then , in the contrast to previous case , the dynamics is regular at very beginning .",
    "let us consider the dynamics of the frw models with phantoms where the specific form of the equation of state for phantom fluid is assumed .",
    "we model the fluid which violates the weak energy condition using the equation of state @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "such a model of fluid can be treated as the simplest phenomenological model of phantom matter .",
    "the dynamics of this model can be represented by a two - dimensional dynamical system ( therefore non - chaotic at very beginning ) on the phase plane @xmath107 or by motion of a classical particle in the one - dimensional potential @xmath108 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath109 system ( [ fph:1 ] ) has the first integral of energy in the form @xmath110 where @xmath111 for the mixture of noninteracting matter and phantoms here @xmath112 are the density parameters at the present epoch . in the general case the potential of the particle - universe takes the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 for the cosmological constant , @xmath115 for string fluid ( also curvature fluid ) , @xmath116 for topological defects .",
    "the phase portraits for the model described by system  ( [ fph:1 ] ) for the potential function  ( [ fph:3 ] ) are shown on fig .",
    "the trajectory of the flat model separates the regions of closed ( @xmath117 ) and open ( @xmath118 ) models .",
    "moreover , both phase portraits are topologically equivalent .",
    "the presence of additional terms like strings , topological defects ( see @xcite ) do not change the structure of the phase plane .",
    "there is the single critical point located on @xmath119-axis as an intersection with the boundary of the strong energy condition @xmath3 .",
    "note that the obtained phase portraits are equivalent to phase portraits of the frw model with the cosmological constant .",

    "we obtain that if @xmath126 is the solution of ( [ fph:5 ] ) for the sub - negative equation of state @xmath127 then @xmath128 is also its solution for other form of the negative equation of state @xmath129 .",
    "let us note that for @xmath130 the duality relation which is motivated by superstring theory of duality symmetries @xcite is the exact symmetry of dynamical equations .",
    "this paper addressed the problem of complexity of the flat frw dynamics with phantom modelled in terms of scalar fields .",
    "we proposed a criterion of non - integrability in the liouville sense as an adequate measure of complexity of the phantom cosmology .",
    "this approach is opted because the gauge freedom in the choice of a time parameterization or a lapse function unables us to discuss chaos in general relativity in the standard way .",
    "non - integrability is an invariant feature of a system and can be use as an indicator of its complex dynamics .",
    "we considered the two approaches to model the phantom fields in the frw model and showed how different dynamics of the models are in these approaches . in the first approach which could be called `` microscopic '' we used scalar fields in modelling the pressure and energy density . in the second approach we used the explicit dependence of pressure versus energy density , which can be called phenomenological and found integrable dynamics in contrast to the non - integrable dynamics of the first approach .    in this context non - integrability",
    "is a generic feature of the phantom cosmology and only for a certain discrete set of values of model parameters phantom cosmology is integrable in the liouville sense . from the physical point of view",
    "one can interpret this property as the complexity of dynamical behavior of trajectories in the phase space .",
    "therefore we can not expect any simple analytical relation for solutions ( trajectories ) of the system or the form of relation @xmath131 and @xmath132 along the trajectories .",
    "nevertheless , the integrable cases with zero - measure in the space of all solutions exists , they can lead to some analytical dependence of @xmath133 , after the elimination of time . as the example of simple analytical form of the equation of state we considered the barotropic equation of state which violates the weak energy condition .",
    "we obtained that this model is integrable and exhibits the regular dynamics .",
    "we conclude that non - integrability which is a generic feature of the frw model with phantom fields favors rather non - analytical forms of the equation of state .",
    "however , assuming the barotropic form of equation of state for the phantom model we obtain the integrable dynamics at very beginning .",
    "we expect that phenomenological equation of state can be realized by a microscopic scalar field with some potential",
