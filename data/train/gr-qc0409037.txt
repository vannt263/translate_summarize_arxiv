    "the @xmath0-mode instability @xcite in rotating neutron stars has attracted much attention due to its possible role in limiting the spin rates of neutron stars and the possibility of producing gravitational waves detectable by ligo ii .",
    "however , the significance of this instability depends strongly on the maximum amplitude to which the @xmath0-mode can grow .",
    "a number of damping mechanisms of the @xmath0-mode have been examined , but no definite conclusion of the maximum amplitude can be made ( see @xcite for reviews ; see also @xcite and references therein for a discussion of recent developments ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we reported that large amplitude @xmath0-modes are subjected to a _",
    "instability that worked against the gravitational - radiation driven instability .",
    "our numerical simulations showed that , for an @xmath0-mode with a large enough amplitude ( e.g. , with a dimensionless amplitude parameter @xmath3 of order unity ) , the hydrodynamic instability operated in a timescale much shorter than that of the gravitational - radiation driven instability .",
    "this hydrodynamic instability when fully developed will cause the @xmath0-mode to decay catastrophically . as a result , the neutron star changes rapidly from the uniformly rotating @xmath0-mode pattern to a complicated differential rotating configuration .",
    "however , we have not been able to identify the hydrodynamic mechanism responsible for this catastrophic decay .    in this paper",
    "we establish that this catastrophic decay is due mainly to a particular three - mode coupling between the @xmath0-mode and a pair of fluid modes .",
    "we identify the daughter modes and show that their frequencies satisfy a resonance condition : the sum of their frequencies is equal to the @xmath0-mode frequency . the importance of three - mode coupling in the @xmath0-mode evolution was first pointed out by @xcite . by comparing the fully nonlinear simulation with the second - order perturbation equations , we determined the responsible mode coupling strength @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 implies that this particular three - mode coupling alone gives a rather stringent limit to the usual picture of a neutron star with a fluid flow pattern dominated by the @xmath0-mode : such a picture can only be valid with the dimensionless @xmath0-mode amplitude @xmath3 smaller than or of the order @xmath5 . beyond that , the @xmath0-mode must be considered to be strongly coupled to other fluid modes . instead of the gravitational radiation reaction , it is the fluid coupling that dominates the dynamics of the @xmath0-mode when its amplitude grows to @xmath5 .",
    "its evolution is strongly affected by the fluid coupling in a timescale much shorter than its growth time due to the gravitational - radiation driven instability .",
    "in particular , at that point the steady rise in amplitude of the @xmath0-mode due to gravitational radiation reaction will turn into a catastrophic decay .",
    "this is the main conclusion of the paper .    what happens after the catastrophic decay ?",
    "as the post - decay fluid flow involves couplings between a large number of short wavelength modes beyond the resolution of our simulation , we can not rule out the possibility that the @xmath0-mode can regain energy from these fluid modes and be revived within a hydrodynamic timescale ( for a detailed study of such `` bouncing '' phenomena see @xcite ) before the star returns to uniform rotation .",
    "however , we do not see any hint of such bouncing in our simulations with an @xmath0-mode amplitude of order unity .",
    "this observation together with the consideration that a large number of fluid modes are involved in the catastrophic decay , lead us to conjecture that there is no such `` bouncing '' of the @xmath0-mode amplitude after the catastrophic decay .",
    "we further note that there could be fluid modes with wavelengths shorter than what our numerical simulation can resolve but with couplings to the @xmath0-mode strong enough that place a stronger limit on the @xmath0-mode amplitude , as argued by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the bound we establish in this paper already has significant implications on the astrophysical importance of the @xmath0-mode instability .",
    "the study in this paper makes no particular assumption on the neutron star model .",
    "the star is described simply as a self - gravitating , perfect - fluid body with a generic equation of state ( a polytropic eos ) ; no dissipative mechanism is assumed .",
    "we have seen the same hydrodynamic phenomenon in simulations with stellar models of different central densities and polytropic indices .",
    "this suggests that the hydrodynamic mechanism being studied is quite generic .",
    "we solve the newtonian hydrodynamics equations for a non - viscous , self - gravitating fluid body in the presence of a current quadrupole post - newtonian radiation reaction @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the neutron star model used in this study ; and a detailed discussion on how we set up a large amplitude @xmath0-mode as an initial state for simulation . to set the stage for the study in this paper",

    "it is also interesting to note the appearance of the peak at the @xmath0-mode frequency @xmath17 in the later time evolution .",

    "there is no sign of the @xmath0-mode re - gaining its energy from the many fluid modes it directly or indirectly coupled to .",
    "one important implication of this is : the maximum amplitude @xmath116 an @xmath0-mode can get to through the gravitational - radiation driven instability is given by @xmath117 .",
    "however , there is a caution : our simulation is carried out with @xmath3 of order unity but not directly at @xmath114 .",
    "there is a possibility that even though the fluid flow is no longer dominated by that of the @xmath0-mode after the two daughter modes catch up at @xmath118 , the three - mode perturbation system eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mode_eq1])-([eq : mode_eq3 ] ) could remain a valid description of the neutron star .",
    "the perturbation system can fail to represent the flow of the star for two reasons : ( i ) the mode amplitudes become large , so that higher order perturbation terms in the equations can not be neglected , or ( ii ) the effects of modes other than the three modes studied become significant ( this shows up also as the @xmath79 s are changing on a short time scale ) ; such a situation is strongly suggested by our simulation .",
    "unfortunately simulations of timescales long enough to accurately capture the behavior of @xmath0-modes with a small @xmath3 value require a computational resource beyond what is available to us , and we can not investigate the catastrophic decay at small @xmath3 value in full .    in case",
    "the second - order perturbation equations ( [ eq : mode_eq1])-([eq : mode_eq3 ] ) are still valid at the point @xmath115 , what could happen subsequent to the catastrophic decay ?",
    "in particular , can the amplitude of the @xmath0-mode evolve to a value substantially larger than @xmath91 ?",
    "the subsequent evolution described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mode_eq1])-([eq : mode_eq3 ] ) depends strongly on the relative values of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath64 , and the frequency detuning @xmath119 . as discussed in @xcite , a stable equilibrium solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mode_eq1])-([eq : mode_eq3 ] ) exists if both the damping and detuning are large : @xmath120 ; @xmath121 .",
    "otherwise , the system is unstable .",
    "( note that in our study @xmath106 and @xmath107 represent the rate of energy leaking out of the three - mode system to other fluid modes of the neutron star , which is described by a perfect fluid eos with no viscosity . )    in the case where a stable equilibrium solution exists , the system will settle into a steady state with the mode amplitudes being roughly the same .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the @xmath0-mode @xmath116 would be given by @xmath91 .",
    "on the other hand , in the unstable case eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mode_eq1])-([eq : mode_eq3 ] ) predict that after the amplitudes of the three coupled modes become comparable , the amplitudes of the three modes will fluctuate in a short timescale with rapid energy transfer between them , and the average amplitude of all three modes could grow until the second - order perturbation analysis becomes invalid . however , such oscillation of energy between the three modes is possible only if their phase relations are well preserved in the evolution , a condition we believe may not happen in realistic nonlinear hydrodynamic evolutions : at @xmath122 a large number of other fluid modes enter into the picture and affect the fluid evolution significantly .",
    "the energy originally in the @xmath0-mode is transferred to many fluid modes .",
    "the involvement of a large number of modes suggests that the oscillation of energy back to the @xmath0-mode in a short dynamical timescale is unlikely . as an example , in a chain of @xmath123 coupled nonlinear oscillators an equipartition of energy among the coupled modes is achieved if the energy of the initial large scale mode is larger than a certain threshold , which tends to zero sufficiently fast at increasing @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that , after cascading its energy down to a sea of coupled modes , a generic initial large scale mode can not regain its energy within dynamical timescale .",
    "we believe that this is also the case for nonlinear couplings of the @xmath0-mode to other fluid modes in rotating neutron stars .",
    "hence , we _ conjecture _ that such oscillation of energy can not occur beyond the catastrophic decay and the amplitude of the @xmath0-mode is bounded by @xmath91 .",
    "nevertheless , we do not rule out the possibility that the global @xmath0-mode could grow again in a secular timescale ( @xmath124 s ) due to the driving of gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "we have extended some of our simulations for a timescale of 10 ms after the catastrophic decay .",
    "however , we do not see any evidence of the regrowth of an unstable @xmath0-mode , even with an artificially enlarged radiation reaction force .",
    "one possibility is that the strong differential rotation developed during the catastrophic decay ( see @xcite ) may act to stabilize the @xmath0-mode .",
    "if this is the case , it will take even a much longer time , until the differential rotation is damped out by viscosity ( not modelled in our simulations ) , before the @xmath0-mode can grow again .",
    "to model such regrowth scenario , if it occurs at all , would be too expensive computationally for present - day technology .",
    "this is still an open issue and remains to be investigated in the future .",
    "there are two other numerical simulations of nonlinear @xmath0-modes , both finding that , large amplitude @xmath0-modes can exist for a long period of time .",
    "@xcite performed relativistic simulations of the @xmath0-mode on a fixed spacetime background .",
    "they started with a large @xmath0-mode perturbation in a relativistic rotating star and evolved the system for about twenty rotation periods .",
    "they found no evidence of mode saturation unless the @xmath0-mode amplitude was much larger than unity .",
    "@xcite carried out numerical simulations of the growth of the @xmath0-modes driven by the current quadrupole radiation reaction in newtonian hydrodynamics . to achieve a significant growth of the @xmath0-mode amplitude in a reasonably short computational time , they multiplied the radiation reaction force by a factor of 4500 , decreasing the growth time of the @xmath0-mode from about 40 s to 10 ms .",
    "the @xmath0-mode amplitude @xmath3 grew to @xmath125 , before shock waves appeared on the surface of the star and the @xmath0-mode collapsed .",
    "they suggested that the nonlinear saturation amplitude of the @xmath0-modes might be set by dissipation of energy in the production of shock waves .",
    "we note that , with the artificially large radiation reaction , the results in @xcite assume that no hydrodynamic process takes energy away from the @xmath0-mode in a timescale between 10 ms and 40 s ( the artificial growth time and the actual physical growth time , respectively ) . in our previous work @xcite , we showed that @xmath0-modes of amplitudes unity or above were destroyed by a catastrophic decay within this time period . during the process the @xmath0-mode motion changed rapidly to a vortical motion and strong differential rotation developed .",
    "the mechanism leading to this catastrophic decay is studied in this paper .",
    "another approach to study the nonlinear couplings between the @xmath0-modes and other fluid modes is via perturbation theory . in this analytic approach",
    ", one assumes that the system is weakly interactive ; and the @xmath0-mode couples to other fluid modes via the lowest order couplings so that higher order effects can be ignored .",
    "based on a second - order perturbation theory developed by @xcite , @xcite proposed a turbulent cascade scenario in which the energy of the @xmath0-mode leaked to a large number of short wavelength inertial modes due to three - mode couplings .",
    "the coupled modes are in turn damped by viscosity .",
    "they argued that the rotating frame @xmath0-mode energy could be limited to @xmath126 for a millisecond rotating star , where @xmath127 . in their normalization",
    ", the @xmath0-mode amplitude ( @xmath128 in their notation ) was related to the mode energy by @xmath129 .",
    "note that the normalization of the @xmath0-mode amplitude @xmath3 used by us @xcite is such that @xmath130 ( see sec .",
    "8 of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , in our notation , the maximum @xmath0-mode amplitude suggested by them is @xmath131 .    in a recent second - order perturbative work ,",
    "@xcite have studied the evolution of the unstable @xmath0-mode in a nonlinear network coupled with about 5000 inertial modes .",
    "they considered a uniform density , incompressible uniformly rotating star . with this simplified model , they calculated the eigenfunctions of the inertial modes and the three - mode coupling coefficient @xmath4 analytically .",
    "their study suggested that , while the behavior of the @xmath0-mode was complicated and depended sensitively on the damping effects of the coupled modes , the @xmath0-mode amplitude would in general be limited to a small amplitude : @xmath132 in their notation .",
    "note that the normalization convention used by @xcite is such that the @xmath0-mode energy is given by @xmath133 .",
    "this in turn gives the relation @xmath134 , and thus the @xmath0-mode is limited to @xmath135 in our notation .    in the perturbation studies of @xcite",
    ", they found that beyond the critical point @xmath91 , energy might oscillate between the @xmath0-mode and the fluid modes it coupled to .",
    "after the catastrophic decay , the @xmath0-mode amplitude could re - grow to a value comparable to that just before the decay in a short timescale . in our numerical simulations with @xmath3 of order unity",
    ", we do not see any such oscillations , instead the @xmath0-mode energy cascades into a large number of fluid modes beyond @xmath91 .",
    "we conjecture that such oscillations are not possible in fully nonlinear evolutions and realistic neutron stars .",
    "this conjecture in turns implies that the @xmath0-mode amplitude is limited to @xmath91 .",
    "in this paper , we identify a particular three - mode coupling between the @xmath0-mode and the pair of fluid modes responsible for the catastrophic decay of large - amplitude @xmath0-modes seen in our previous simulations @xcite .",
    "the three modes satisfy a suitable resonance condition to high accuracy .",
    "this also demonstrates that hydrodynamic three - mode coupling can play an important role in the @xmath0-mode evolution as first pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we have also extracted the eigenfunctions of the two daughter modes , and demonstrated that they are consistent with having azimuthal mode number @xmath57 .",
    "while the fully nonlinear simulations are carried out with a large amplitude @xmath0-mode that is obtained by an artificially large gravitational radiation reaction , we succeed in drawing conclusions on the @xmath0-mode evolution at smaller amplitude through a comparison with a second - order perturbation analysis .",
    "in particular , we show that the three - mode equations ( [ eq : mode_eq1])-([eq : mode_eq3 ] ) are valid in the simulation when the daughter modes are small , and determine the coupling strength @xmath98 of this particular three - mode coupling to be ( at least ) @xmath136 .",
    "this implies that the two daughter modes will catch up with the @xmath0-mode at a rather small amplitude ( @xmath137 ) , for an @xmath0-mode driven by gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "we conclude that at @xmath138 the usual picture of the fluid flow of the neutron star dominated by an @xmath0-mode would no longer be valid , with many other modes significantly affecting the fluid flow leading to a catastrophic decay .",
    "our numerical simulations are limited to a spatial resolution of @xmath139 km .",
    "fluid modes with wavelengths smaller than @xmath140 km can not be accurately represented .",
    "it is possible that the couplings of the @xmath0-mode to a large number of shorter wavelength modes can limit @xmath91 to an even smaller value ( as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "the amplitude for the catastrophic decay @xmath91 determined in this paper is as an upper bound .",
    "the study in this paper is carried out with the neutron star described as a self - gravitating perfect fluid body with a polytropic equation of state .",
    "no particular dissipation mechanism is assumed .",
    "this suggests that the hydrodynamic behavior we see is of rather general nature .",
    "finally , we comment on future prospects of numerical investigations of the @xmath0-mode instability .",
    "an interesting question that one might ask is whether numerical simulations could be used to test the maximal amplitudes inferred in this paper by starting the @xmath0-mode evolution directly at @xmath141 instead of @xmath142 as we have done in our simulations .",
    "as we have shown in @xcite , the time it takes for the @xmath0-mode to reach the point of catastrophic decay depends sensitively on the value of @xmath3 . for @xmath143",
    ", it would take a time much longer than what could be modelled accurately by our finite - differencing code in order to see a significant growth of the daughter modes and the catastrophic decay of the @xmath0-mode .",
    "nevertheless , it might be possible to use hydrodynamics codes based on spectral methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to handle such long timescale problem , since spectral methods can achieve a much higher numerical accuracy in general for smooth fluid flow .",
