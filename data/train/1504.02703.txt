    "however , the erstwhile vertex @xmath145 of @xmath142 is also linked to all the _ replica _ vertices hence , inducing the complete graph @xmath141 .",
    "clearly , another largest complete graph does not exist .",
    "the primitive hole number of a set - graph is determined recursively in the following theorem .    for a set - graph @xmath146",

    "this calculation is done as follows .",
    "the set of replica vertices together with the vertex @xmath149 induce a complete subgraph @xmath150 and hence an additional @xmath151 primitive holes are added to the extended graph . finally , for each edge @xmath152 the vertices @xmath153 induce a @xmath154 subgraph and the number of primitive holes thus formed is @xmath155 .",

    "from the proof of proposition [ p - sgkn ] we can notice that the replica vertices and vertex @xmath190 induce a largest complete subgraph , @xmath191 in the extended graph of @xmath20 .",
    "we also note that the replica vertices and vertex @xmath192 form a second largest complete subgraph , @xmath191 .    since the vertices @xmath192 and @xmath193 are not adjacent in @xmath20 , both of them have the same colour , say @xmath194 and colour the replica vertices by the colours @xmath195 . since , no other largest complete graph exists it is always possible to find at least one pair of erstwhile - replica vertices which are non - adjacent .",
    "hence the erstwhile vertex can carry the colour of such a replica vertex .",
    "this can be done in such a way that two adjacent erstwhile vertices do not carry the same colour by using the colours @xmath196 accept for the colour of @xmath96 , exhaustively .",
