    "star formation is one the most important processes in galaxies , yet our understanding of it is far from satisfactory . while it is commonly recognised that the evolution of the large - scale structure of the universe is linked to that of dark matter , which is driven by gravitation , baryonic physics is much more challenging .",
    "having a good understanding of star formation would be a great piece to put in the puzzle of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the first step is to be able to measure accurately the amount of star formation itself for a large number of galaxies .",
    "this means we need to be able to build statistical samples with observables that are linked to the recent star formation activity .",
    "one of the easiest way to perform this is to consider rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) selected samples , as the emission of galaxies in this range of the spectrum is dominated by young , short - lived , massive stars @xcite .",
    "thanks to the combination of various observatories , building uv - selected samples is now feasible over most of the evolution of the universe , from @xmath11 to @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is however one drawback to this approach , which is that the attenuation by dust is particularly efficient in the uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as the absorbed energy is re - emitted in the far - infrared ( fir ) range of the spectrum , it is necessary to combine both of these tracers to get the complete energy budget of star formation .",
    "the current observational facilities however are such that it is much easier to build large samples from the restframe uv than from the restframe ir over a wide redshift range .",
    "it is then useful to look at the fir properties of uv - selected galaxies as a function of redshift in order to understand the biases inherent to a uv selection , to characterise for instance the galaxy populations probed by ir and uv selections , determine the amount of total cosmic star formation rate probed by a rest - frame uv selection , or the link between the level of dust attenuation ( as probed by the ratio of ir to uv luminosities , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and physical properties .",
    "this approach has been successful by combining uv selections and _ spitzer _ data at @xmath12 to study the link between dust attenuation and uv luminosity or stellar mass @xcite , as well as correlation with galaxy colors @xcite . by measuring the ratio between the cosmic star formation rate density estimated from ir and uv selections",
    ", @xcite showed that the fraction of the cosmic star formation rate probed by a uv selection , without correction for dust attenuation , decreases from 50 per cent to 16 per cent between @xmath10 and @xmath8 @xcite . at @xmath13 , _ spitzer _ data probe the mid - ir range of the spectrum , which can lead to an overestimation of the ir luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . at these redshifts , _ herschel _ @xcite data become particularly valuable for such projects .",
    "@xcite extended this kind of study by stacking @xmath14 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) in _",
    "herschel_/pacs @xcite images to investigate their dust attenuation properties : they estimated that typical uv - selected galaxies at these epochs have infrared luminosities similar to luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xcite combined the measurements at @xmath16 of the uv @xcite and ir @xcite restframe luminosity functions to infer the redshift evolution of the total ( uv+ir ) cosmic star formation rate and dust attenuation .",
    "in a previous study based on a stacking analysis of uv - selected galaxies at @xmath5 in _",
    "herschel_/spire @xcite images , we showed that using a uv - selection at @xmath5 with a proper correction for dust attenuation enables us to recover most of the total cosmic star formation activity at that epoch @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary to investigate the link between dust attenuation and a number of galaxy properties , in order to be able to accurately correct for dust attenuation , by providing empirical relations for instance .",
    "one of the most commonly used empirical relation in this context is based on the correlation between the slope of the uv continuum and the dust attenuation @xcite .",
    "such correlation has been observed for star - forming galaxies from high to low redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the common assumption that the relation derived from local starbursts @xcite is universal is questionable @xcite as the extinction curve is dependent on the dust geometry ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and dust properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the uv slope of the continuum encodes partly the star formation history of the galaxies @xcite , and the observed relation between the uv slope and the dust attenuation is also selection - dependent @xcite .",
    "it is then useful to turn towards other observables , which might provide better ways to correct for dust attenuation in a statistical sense .",
    "dust attenuation is for instance not really well correlated with observed uv luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the correlation with stellar mass is tighter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is somewhat expected as the dust production is linked to the star formation history , through heavy elements production , and stellar mass in this context can be seen as a crude summary of star formation history .",
    "investigating the link between dust attenuation and stellar mass is interesting by itself , but getting a direct estimate of the ir luminosity implies that we can also derive the star formation rate ( sfr ) accurately .",
    "this means that we are able for instance to characterise the relation between the sfr and the stellar mass . by considering galaxy samples based on star - formation activity",
    ", we are actually expecting to deal with objects belonging to the so - called ` main sequence ' of galaxies .",
    "a number of studies pointed out that there is a tight relation between the sfr and the stellar mass of galaxies , from high to low redshift @xcite .",
    "galaxies on this main sequence are more extended than starbursts @xcite , the latter representing only a small contribution , in terms of number density , to the global population of star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the relation between sfr and stellar mass also seems to be independent of the environment of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "while there is debate on the slope and scatter of this relation , it is definitely observed at various redshifts , with its amplitude decreasing with cosmic time @xcite .",
    "the mere existence of this relation raises a number of issues for galaxy formation and evolution , as it implies that galaxies experience a rather smooth star formation history .    in this paper , we take advantage of the combination of the multiwavelength data available within the cosmos field @xcite , with the _",
    "herschel_/spire observations obtained in the framework of the herschel multi - tiered extragalactic survey key program ( hermes , * ? ? ?",
    "we are assuming here that the rest - frame fir emission we measure originates from the dust responsible for the uv / optical attenuation .",
    "indeed , the wavelength range covered by spire is dominated by the emission of dust heated by stars , the contribution from dust heated by active galactic nuclei being significantly lower at these wavelengths @xcite . moreover , our uv - selection biases against galaxies dominated by old stellar populations , hence the fir emission we measure is mostly due to the dust heated by young stellar populations .",
    "we focus on three uv - selected samples at @xmath17 , and 1.5 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar study based on h@xmath18-selected sample at @xmath19 ) .",
    "we revisit the relations between dust attenuation and uv luminosity as well as stellar mass , over this wide redshift range , using homogeneous selections and stellar mass determination .",
    "our aim is to disentangle the link between dust attenuation and these two physical quantities , by directly measuring their ir luminosities thanks to _ herschel_/spire data .",
    "we also put new constraints on the sfr - stellar mass relations from @xmath3 to @xmath20 , and use our results to discuss the star formation histories of main sequence galaxies .",
