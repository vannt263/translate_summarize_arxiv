    "in this paper we consider a new link invariant .",
    "its construction is naturally divided into three main parts .",
    "first , on a given representation of the link group we define a covering of 3-sphere branched along the link .",
    "then , we map the covering space into 3-dimensional euclidean space according to the representation . in the last , algebraic part , we build an acyclic complex ; the torsion of this complex is the main ingredient of our invariant .",
    "such an invariant was first constructed by i.g .",
    "korepanov for 3-manifolds in the paper  @xcite . there",
    "the simplest version of the invariant was considered corresponding to the trivial covering of a manifold .",
    "calculations showed that this version raised to the @xmath1th power equals the order of the torsion subgroup of the first homology group .",
    "however , when we use the universal cover , which corresponds to the unity of the fundamental group , we get more interesting version of the invariant associated with the ( abelian ) reidemeister torsion , see  @xcite .    we have written a few computer programs which allow to calculate the invariant for a given manifold @xmath2 ( or link @xmath3 ) and for a given representation @xmath4 of the fundamental group ( or the link group ) in the group of orientation preserving motions of @xmath5 . with the help of these programs we made two conjectures .",
    "the first one states a connection of the abelian version of our invariant with the alexander polynomial of link .",
    "the second conjecture states that for a torus knot and non abelian representation of its group , our invariant is the squared non abelian reidemeister torsion investigated and calculated in  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : constr ] we define the invariant for a given link and representation of its group . in section  [ sec : calc ] we propose an example of calculation of abelian and non abelian versions of the invariant for the trefoil knot . in the last section",
    "we suggest our conjectures .",
    "* acknowledgements .",
    "* i am glad to thank i.g .",
    "korepanov for proposing me the problem and numerous helpful discussions and remarks .",
    "let us describe a way of constructing the invariant following  @xcite with minor changes in notation .",
    "suppose we are given a link @xmath6 endowed with a certain orientation .",
    "let us consider a triangulation of @xmath7 satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the whole link @xmath3 lies on certain edges of the triangulation ; [ enu : first ] 2 .   for any tetrahedron in the triangulation ,",
    "not more than two of its vertices belong to @xmath3 ; 3 .",
    "any edge @xmath8 of the triangulation either has two different vertices as its ends or , if its ends coincide , @xmath8 represents a meridian of the corresponding link component .",
    "[ enu : last ]    we need the edges with coinciding ends from condition  [ enu : last ] ) to define the following simplicial moves .",
    "let an edge @xmath9 lie on a certain link component , and let there be a tetrahedron @xmath10 in the triangulation , with its edge @xmath11 representing a meridian of the corresponding link component .",
    "the move @xmath12 is defined as follows : take a point @xmath13 in the edge @xmath9 and replace the tetrahedron @xmath10 by two tetrahedra @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the move @xmath16 is the inverse to that ( fig .",
    "[ fig : move12 ] ) .    ]    using methods of the paper  @xcite , one can prove the following analogue of the pachner theorem ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "[ thm : kor04 ] a triangulation of sphere @xmath7 obeying the conditions [ enu : first ] )  [ enu : last ] ) can be transformed into any other triangulation obeying the same conditions by a sequence of the following elementary moves :    * pachner moves @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "such moves are not affect the edges lying on the link @xmath3 ( however , the link may pass through edges and/or vertices lying in the boundary of the transformed cluster of tetrahedra ) ; * moves @xmath19 .      to define the invariant",
    "we need a triangulation of 3-sphere satisfying the conditions  [ enu : first ] )  [ enu : last ] ) .",
    "we can construct such a triangulation for arbitrary link as follows .",
    "strictly speaking , we are going to construct a _ pseudotriangulation _ of 3-sphere .",
    "it differs from a triangulation in the proper sense in that a simplex in a pseudotriangulation can appear several times in the boundary of a simplex of greater dimension .",
    "clearly , any pseudotriangulation can always be transformed into triangulation using a barycentric subdivision . however , in our case this would make no sense , since such a subdivision significantly increases the number of vertices and edges and hence makes the calculations much more difficult .",
    "so , let @xmath20 be the full amount of crossing points of the link diagram .",
    "since the euler characteristic of 2-sphere is 2 , it follows that the link diagram splits the plane by @xmath21 regions .",
    "denote by @xmath22 the @xmath23th crossing point of the link diagram .",
    "let the plane with the link diagram be @xmath24 in @xmath5 .",

    "consider a bipyramid over each of @xmath21 polygons with @xmath25 and @xmath27 as its apexes .",
    "adding @xmath21 more edges @xmath29 , which correspond to the @xmath21 bipyramids , and replacing @xmath5 with @xmath30 , we obtain a triangulation of @xmath7 consisting of @xmath31 tetrahedra .",
    "further , we transform the obtained triangulation in a neighborhood of each point @xmath22 in such a way as depicted in figure  [ fig : triangs3 ] .",

    "besides , four more tetrahedra @xmath38 arise .",
    "doing this transformation for all @xmath39 , we obtain a desired triangulation of @xmath7 with the link @xmath3 going through some of its edges .",
    "surely , the conditions  [ enu : first ] )  [ enu : last ] ) hold for this triangulation .    thus , the set of vertices ( 0-simplices ) of the triangulation consists of @xmath40 elements : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
