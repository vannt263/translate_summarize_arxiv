    "the existence of a multiverse of solutions to string theory makes it eminently desirable to find a dynamical principle that would select a universe , or a subset of the multiverse that has properties similar to ours .",
    "such a principle might be provided in the framework of quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the wave function of the universe yields a probability distribution for the dynamical parameters of the multiverse . depending on the boundary condition chosen for the wave function ,",
    "the probability distribution is sharply peaked at a zero value of the cosmological constant ( cc ) @xcite or is peaked at a large value of the cc @xcite giving rise to an inflationary universe .",
    "a related and complementary approach is based on the statistics of solutions @xcite , one of whose outcomes is that the number density of solutions is uniform as a function of the value of the cc .    in this paper",
    "we propose that the universe emerged from the string era in a thermally excited state above the hartle - hawking vacuum .",
    "we show that imposing this boundary condition on the wave function of the universe leads , within a mini - superspace model , to interesting restrictions on the allowed dynamics .",
    "high temperature effects were first introduced in a related context , to the best of our knowledge , by vilenkin @xcite who suggested including them in the context of the so - called tunneling boundary condition , but did not work out the consequences .",
    "we will show in detail the relevance of these effects both to the hartle - hawking ( hh ) wave function and to the tunneling wave function .",
    "our proposal is motivated by an interesting observation that was made recently by sarangi and tye @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "they considered the tunneling amplitude as a function of the cc @xmath0 , and found that if rather than evaluating it from the hh wave function @xcite that describes tunneling from nothing , @xmath1 a modified wave function is used , then the tunneling amplitude @xmath2 has a critical point ( a maximum for the hh choice ) .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath3 is a constant that depends on the string mass scale @xmath4 , the planck scale @xmath5 and the number of fluctuating degrees of freedom @xmath6 .",
    "the critical cc that sarangi and tye found is @xmath7 .",
    "the original argument by hawking was that since the wave function ( [ hwave ] ) is peaked at @xmath8 it explains why the observed value of the cc today is zero .",
    "of course at that time there was just an observational upper bound on the cc , and it was assumed that the upper bound implies that the true value is zero .",
    "the problem with this argument is that it predicts a large but empty universe .",
    "sarangi and tye argue that their modified wave function ( [ stwave ] ) predicts inflation and hence makes the choice of the hh boundary condition more interesting .",
    "we use a mini - superspace model for our discussion . in this model",
    "only the time - dependent scale factor of the universe , and some time - dependent but homogeneous fields are considered and all other degrees of freedom are ignored .",
    "we regard the mini - superspace calculation as a toy model which by itself is a well defined quantum mechanical problem that can be solved self - consistently and hopefully incorporates some features of the complete quantum gravity calculation . at the current stage of development",
    "an attempt to do a more complete quantum gravity analysis seems to lead to the notorious problems of euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "thus our calculation should be regarded as an indication of the true solution of the full dynamical problem . for self - consistency",
    "we apply the quantum tunneling picture in four dimensional mini - superspace only for large scale factors and energies and temperatures that are small compared to the string scale and the kaluza - klein scale .",
    "the existence of the primordial temperature allows us to do this at the price of not being able to say anything about the quantum origin at zero scale factor .",
    "we regard the inclusion of primordial radiation as a parametrization of our ignorance of the physics at the quantum origin .",
    "we start our discussion in the simpler case for which the moduli , the dilaton @xmath9 , and the volume modulus @xmath10 are fixed by stringy effects . in this case",
    "the thermal boundary conditions lead to results that are similar to those of sarangi and tye .",
    "then we take into account the dynamics of the moduli by assuming they are stabilized as in the recent works on moduli stabilization by fluxes and non - perturbative effects @xcite .",
    "moduli stabilization by fluxes was considered previously in @xcite .",
    "we show that in order to have a finite potential barrier and therefore a large tunneling amplitude , the end point of the tunneling should be to a region of the moduli potential that supports accelerated expansion . taking into account additional features of the moduli potentials",
    "we further show that the tunneling takes place to a maximum or a saddle point that is within a bounded region in moduli space .",
    "in particular , we find that the tunneling to the tail of the moduli potentials , where they runaway to decompactification for example , is disfavored .",
    "the reason for this is that these regions do not lead to sustained accelerated expansion .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . after a brief review of the wave function calculus in sect .",
    "[ s : wavefunction ] we discuss in sect .",
    "[ s : thermal ] thermal effects and their significance to the tunneling amplitude . in sect .",
    "[ s : tunnprob ] we discuss the dependence of the tunneling amplitude on the parameters and conclude that we must add the dependence on moduli .",

    "[ s : kklt ] we discuss in detail the application of our results to the model of kachru , kallosh , linde and trivedi ( kklt ) .",
    "section [ s : conclusions ] contains our conclusions , and in the appendix we compare our work to that of sarangi and tye .",
    "let us first briefly review the calculation of the wave function of the universe in the mini - superspace context . consider a theory with a dynamical cc @xmath0 whose action is @xmath11 here all other dynamical fields are ignored and it is assumed that their effects are incorporated into a single parameter @xmath0 that is essentially an integration constant .",

    "( [ wave ] ) we have ignored the prefactors because they will not be important for the rest of the discussion .",
    "the classical action @xmath24 is evaluated on a classical solution so that @xmath25 . for @xmath19",
    ", @xmath26 is of course imaginary and the wave function is real .",
    "hartle and hawking @xcite have imposed the no - boundary boundary condition which in this context means that the positive sign should be taken in eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) . then the under the barrier wave function near @xmath27 is given by the growing exponential , and the probability of the universe emerging after tunneling through the barrier is given by @xmath28\\sim e^{2/3\\lambda}.   \\label{hh}\\ ] ]    hawking @xcite has argued that this distribution explains the observed vanishing of the cc . at that time",
    "it was assumed that the observations indicated that it was in fact zero .",
    "now there is strong evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerated and therefore that the cc , or a similar form of dark energy is small and positive .",
    "however , as many have pointed out , the probability distribution ( [ hh ] ) also predicts an empty universe - there would have been no primordial inflationary stage .",
    "the result ( [ hh ] ) depends very sensitively on the nature of the state and in particular on the boundary conditions . if one uses the euclidean path integral to define the state , the no - boundary proposal gives the ground state wave function .",
    "the resulting distribution is rather surprising .",
    "it implies that the tunneling amplitude increases exponentially when the barrier becomes larger .",
    "this is certainly not what happens in laboratory tunneling experiments which show that the tunneling amplitude decreases exponentially with the size of the barrier .",
    "linde @xcite and vilenkin @xcite have proposed different boundary conditions that yield results that are similar to the probability distributions in standard tunneling processes .",
    "vilenkin has proposed that only an outgoing wave should exist in the lorentzian region for @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the universe has only an expanding component whereas the hh wave function is a superposition of expanding and contracting universes .",
    "the probability distribution that results from linde s and vilenkin s proposals is @xmath29\\sim e^{-2/3\\lambda}.   \\label{lv}\\ ] ] this clearly favors a large cc .",
    "in fact it favors a situation for which the barrier is as small as possible , and even no barrier at all ! since the semi - classical theory is valid only up to some cutoff scale , which we will choose to be the string scale @xmath4 , this seems to imply that the universe is created in a state with string scale cc .",
    "linde has proposed recently @xcite that a flat compact universe may perhaps be more likely , since in this case there is no barrier .    to discuss inflation",
    "it is necessary to include at least one inflaton field .",
    "this is done for instance in @xcite where it is shown that the formulae ( [ hh],[lv ] ) remain valid when one replaces the cc with the scalar potential @xmath30 , @xmath31 , provided that it is slowly varying , i.e. @xmath32 obviously , these semi - classical considerations are valid only for regions in field space where @xmath33 .",
    "in @xcite various possible potentials are illustrated with the corresponding probability distributions for the two cases ( [ hh],[lv ] ) . in all cases",
    "it is clear that the hh distribution will favor tunneling into the lowest positive points in the potential , while the lv distribution will favor tunneling into the highest points of the potential allowed by the cut off .",
    "vilenkin @xcite has argued that the above considerations lead to a ` prediction ' of inflation from the lv wave function , in contrast to what is obtained from the hh wave function .",
    "however the problem is that the conclusion is cutoff dominated . besides",
    ", the natural value of a cutoff would be close to the planck scale , perhaps one or two orders of magnitude below , and this would be too high to agree with observations .",
    "the predicted hubble parameter during inflation is @xmath34 . if the string scale is taken to be an order of magnitude below the planck scale - which is the case for string compactifications where there are no anomalously large extra dimensions , then @xmath35 , in conflict with the wmap result that @xmath36 . to get agreement",
    ", the cutoff scale would have to be at least two orders of magnitude below the planck scale .",
    "we would like to make two remarks about the possible application of the wave function calculus to string theory .",
    "first , in the string theoretic context @xmath30 is typically steep , so that the condition @xmath37 is obeyed only in the vicinity of the critical points of the potential .",
    "thus , strictly speaking the analysis can only compare the relative probability of tunneling to different critical points .",
    "the lv wave function would predict tunneling to the highest critical point whilst the hh wave function would favor the lowest positive one .",
    "second , recent work has shown that in string theory the acceptable solutions that have potentials that can stabilize the moduli necessarily involve fluxes of rr and ns - ns fields . the fluxes make the parameters of the potential , and in particular the cc , discrete integration constants . in the string theory context",
    "one should really consider a probability distribution that depends on all the moduli as well as on the flux parameters .",
    "in contrast , the original hawking argument was made in a model without a scalar field .",
    "the cc was treated as a dynamical quantity arising as an integration constant characterizing the flux of a four form field strength .",
    "our boundary condition proposal for the wave function of the universe can be stated as follows : the universe emerges from the string era in a thermal state above the hartle - hawking vacuum .",
    "we propose that the decay of all the string excited states has created a primordial thermal gas of radiation at a temperature that is somewhat below the hagedorn temperature . at this high temperature",
    "there would be in addition to the massless states some population of a boltzmann suppressed massive string states , and perhaps also a gas of branes @xcite .",
    "these may behave as pressureless matter , or have some other behavior .",
    "we will ignore such contributions for simplicity , since we do not expect this to change the qualitative behavior that we find . within the context of string theory",
    "the effective field theory arguments that we use make sense only at the end of the string era when the energy densities in the universe are somewhat below the string scale .    rather than evaluating the no - boundary thermal partition function",
    ", we evaluate the euclidean mini - superspace path integral with a modified effective potential that includes the temperature corrections .",
    "the leading temperature correction is very simple , a negative term proportional to the fourth power of the temperature is added to the potential in the wdw equation .",
    "equivalently , we can solve the wdw equation with a modified potential , and even though one does not expect a coherent wave function to describe a thermal state , the square of this wdw ` wave function ' would have the interpretation of a density matrix that measures relative probabilities .",
    "since the temperature scales as the inverse scale factor the energy density of the radiation will be of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "the effective potential that goes into the wdw equation becomes @xmath40 the potential barrier is now in the region limited by the roots of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 of course to have a barrier at all the radiation term can not be too large @xmath44 .",
    "this condition needs to be satisfied for the semi - classical theory to remain valid as argued below .    to keep the semi - classical effective field theory approach self - consistent the highest radiation density in the region of interest",
    "should be less than string scale .",
    "i.e. @xmath45 with @xmath46 . using the value @xmath47 from eq.([apm ] ) we get @xmath48 .",
    "expressing @xmath49 in terms of the number of degrees of freedom @xmath6 in thermal equilibrium , @xmath50 we have our final expression for the radiation energy density , @xmath51 the constant @xmath52 must satisfy @xmath53 for the consistency of these arguments .",
    "this energy density corresponds to an initial temperature at @xmath54 of @xmath55 i.e. a temperature close to the hagedorn temperature .",
    "the same estimate can also be obtained by requiring that the initial entropy is close to saturating the entropy bound as discussed in the appendix .",
    "the condition for the existence of a barrier is thus equivalent in this context to the condition that the cosmological constant be smaller than the string scale .",
    "including the contribution of the thermal radiation energy density into the effective action ( [ action2 ] ) , it becomes , @xmath56 where @xmath57 the corresponding classical hamiltonian that replaces the one in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) is @xmath58 the boundaries of the barrier can be rewritten as @xmath59 it is important that for the range @xmath60 , @xmath61 the scale factor is large under the barrier @xmath62 , so the semi - classical mini - superspace calculation is self - consistent .",
    "also since one expects @xmath63 , the above restriction on @xmath52 means that it is about 10 but need not be much bigger .",
    "in fact it is reasonable to expect that the initial temperature at the beginning of the classical evolution @xmath55 is close to but not quite at the string scale .",
    "the initial volume of the universe as it emerges from under the potential barrier into the classically allowed region is @xmath64 .",
    "the horizon volume on the other hand is approximately @xmath65 .",
    "thus the universe starts its classical evolution having a volume which is approximately one horizon volume .",
    "now , in addition to the lorentzian region to the right of @xmath66 , there is also a lorentzian region to the left of @xmath67 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "the solution of the wdw equation in the wkb approximation is obtained by matching the solutions on the boundaries of the three different regions , @xmath68 the exponents are given by @xmath69 in practice the matching has to be done with care since the boundaries of the three regions are turning points where @xmath70 , and therefore the wkb approximation breaks down there .",
    "the new lorentzian region @xmath71 can clarify and resolve the debate about which linear combinations to take inside the forbidden region , and which boundary conditions to choose . if one puts boundary conditions in this region that correspond to  initial conditions \" and not to  final conditions \" about the state of the universe when it starts its classical evolution after tunneling then any generic choice will effectively be equivalent to the hh choice as we now show .",
    "an example of quantum cosmology with a lorentzian region for small @xmath3 was considered in the context of brane gravity in @xcite .",
    "a generic boundary condition in region @xmath72 that is not too far from a  stationary state \" in the sense that it has comparable incident and reflected waves , will yield some finite ratio of @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "unless the coefficient of the increasing exponential @xmath73 is tuned specifically to vanish or to be much smaller than @xmath74 then the rising exponential will dominate the wave function inside the barrier and at the beginning of the lorentzian region .",
    "hence in practice , the hh boundary conditions can be taken , and will be a very good approximation to the generic situation . of course , if for some reason ( for instance , in analogy with @xmath75-decay ) one would like to impose , as advocated by vilenkin , that there is only an outgoing wave function in region iii , then the coefficient @xmath73 would need to be very small . in our setup , this would seem to be a very special choice .",
    "the tunneling amplitude is of the form @xmath76 with @xmath77 in order to get the second equality we have made the substitution @xmath78 .",
    "a simple estimate of the integral which is quite sufficient for our purposes is obtained by assuming a triangular integrand @xmath79 whose height is the maximal height of the potential barrier @xmath80 , and whose width is @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting estimate for @xmath82 is @xmath83 a more sophisticated analysis shows that the integral can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind . in the limit @xmath84 the exact result reduces , as it should , to the previous case ( see eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) ) and its value is @xmath85 , such that in this limit @xmath86 .",
    "the exact expression is @xmath87 + \\frac{2-m}{m}e[m]\\right\\ } ,   \\label{elliptic}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 .",
    "let us now choose the hh @xmath89 sign for the logarithm of the wave function for the reasons that were explained previously ( we will discuss what happens when the other sign is chosen later ) . in this case , the tunneling amplitude is maximized at the maximum of @xmath82 . using the simple estimate of eq .",
    "( [ simplestimate ] ) , we find that when @xmath90 @xmath82 is maximized , and its value is @xmath91 using a more accurate numerical evaluation of the exact expression gives , @xmath92 and @xmath93    the important point here is that the ratio of the radiation energy density to the cc is some finite fixed numerical constant .",
    "this means that the initial radiation energy density determines the value of the cc , @xmath94 it is clear from this formula that the result is sensitive to the initial temperature and that the precise estimation of the value of @xmath95 is not particularly important .",
    "this is essentially the same result as the one obtained in @xcite , except that they have effectively put the constant @xmath96 .",
    "our derivation shows that setting @xmath52 to unity is inconsistent , in that it would in effect give at the barrier a radiation energy density that is greater than the string energy density .",
    "in order to discuss in a meaningful way the relative probabilities for tunneling into different points in the landscape and the issue of whether or not inflation is favored one really needs , in addition to the cc , to introduce the set of moduli fields @xmath97 and their potential @xmath30 .",
    "if the moduli potential is not steep , one could ( following @xcite ) take over the results of sect .",
    "[ s : wavefunction ] with the substitution @xmath98 . however , the string moduli potentials are steep except in a limited domain around their extrema .",
    "let us ignore this for the moment and come back to this issue in section [ s : moduli ] .",
    "let us consider the set of dynamical parameters in the potential that are determined by the fluxes , gauge groups , etc .",
    ", and denote them collectively by @xmath99 .",
    "these vary from point to point in the landscape . now",
    "the string to planck mass ratio depends on the moduli @xmath100 . using the above substitution , our previous maximization argument gives , @xmath101 it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ vmax ] ) that the maximization of the tunneling amplitude puts a constraint on the parameters @xmath99 and the values of the moduli fields to which the universe tunnels .",
    "let us now observe what happens when the lv sign for the under the barrier wave function is chosen corresponding to the usual tunneling situation , with only outgoing waves in the final lorentzian region . then within the class of models that we consider : a closed universe with a positive cc , and radiation whose temperature does not exceed the hagedorn temperature , the maximum of the tunneling amplitude becomes a minimum . now the tunneling amplitude is maximized at the edge of parameter space when @xmath102 , exactly at the point that the barrier disappears ! in this case eq .",
    "( [ vmax ] ) should be replaced by @xmath103 clearly , given that we are ignoring order one factors , the difference between the two cases is not that significant .",

    "the lv wave function favors a larger cc whilst the hh wave function favors a zero cc . with radiation",
    "the hh wave function favors a larger cc than the lv .",

    "an additional conclusion is that if the dominant power in @xmath144 has a less negative eos , the larger the range of @xmath3 that is required for the  dark energy  \" to become dominant over the space curvature .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "in addition , for lower dominant power in @xmath144 , the faster the field @xmath97 is moving .",
    "as the evolution becomes less and less similar to that in the presence of a cc , the scale factor is moving more when under the barrier and the scalar field needs to move more .",
    "this requires that the potential of the scalar field be flat over a larger region in field space so the accelerated expansion could be supported .",
    "another general comment is that one can compare the tunneling amplitude for a cc to that in the case of  softer \" eos ( less negative than @xmath162 ) . assuming that the eos is a constant , leading to a power law dependence @xmath163",
    ", we can see that the tunneling amplitude that comes form the positive exponential mode ( in the case that the magnitudes of the potentials are similar ) is much larger for the softer eos , since the barrier is much larger .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "it should be stressed here that the considerations of this section are independent of the specific choice of the boundary conditions on the wave function .",
    "we have argued that generic @xmath164 conditions lead to the dominance of the rising mode under the barrier .",
    "if however one imposes final conditions such that only the outgoing wave is allowed , then the usual tunneling picture emerges .",
    "obviously , in this case too the barrier needs to end and therefore , as argued above , the tunneling needs to take place to an accelerating universe . by altering the topology of the final state as in @xcite ( or even just the geometry by taking flat or negatively curved universes ) one could eliminate the barrier altogether and in this case",
    "our arguments would be irrelevant .",
    "the discussion and results of sections [ s : thermal ] and [ s : tunnprob ] about the tunneling probability and its extremization did not take into account the fact that the ratio of the string scale to the planck scale @xmath117 is dynamical and moduli dependent , and that the cc should be replaced by the moduli potential .",
    "we reevaluate them in the light of the discussion of section [ s : wdwscalar ] .",
    "we make several assumptions about the form of the moduli potentials that allow us to obtain more definite results .    in the case",
    "that the scalar field @xmath97 is a modulus , there are two possibilities . first , that the true cc is large and then the potential is dominated by the cc .",
    "this case is not very interesting because it does not lead to a universe that is similar to ours .",
    "the more interesting possibility is that the true cc is substantially less than the string scale . in the latter case we know from general arguments about peccei - quinn symmetries and how they break , that the potential is a sum of steep functions .",
    "further , we know that at generic points that are not extrema of the potential and that are in the outer region of moduli space , the potential is dominated by a single steep function ( see , for example , a related discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that the only flat regions in the potential of the moduli fields where @xmath165 occur in the vicinity of an extremum .",
    "we argue that consequently , when the cc is small the universe can not tunnel to a generic point in the outer region of moduli space .",
    "we have seen that the tunneling end point needs to be where the potential energy dominates the energy balance in the universe , and in particular dominates the field s ke .",
    "however , we have just argued that the potential for a generic point in the outer region of moduli space is steep . on the other hand , we know that the cosmological solution of a scalar field on a steep potential leads to the dominance of ke over the potential energy . our conclusion follows .",
    "additionally , we have just argued that the only flat regions in the potential of the moduli fields are in the vicinity of an extremum .",
    "our tentative conclusion is therefore that the universe tunnels to a region that is not far from an extremum of the moduli potential .",
    "we proceed to examine this conclusion in a more concrete setup .",
    "a possible loophole in our argument could exist if some hitherto unknown euclidean transient solutions that support accelerated expansion for a short period of time could be found .",
    "we expect such solutions , if they exists at all , to require some special initial conditions .",
    "we can not discuss their possible existence in the general setup without adding more specific information on the moduli potentials . in sect .",
    "[ s : kklt ] we show that such solutions , even if they do exist , do not modify our conclusions .",

    "we can reason as in sect .",
    "[ ss : fastroll ] that tunneling to an accelerated expansion phase is favored since otherwise the barrier does not end .",
    "since an accelerated expansion phase requires that the potential is flat enough , it reasonable to expand to leading order in an expansion in @xmath177 , and as argued previously it is also reasonable to assume that the moduli are near a critical point in the potential .",
    "thus the arguments of sect .",
    "[ s : thermal ] that lead to eq .",
    "( [ vmax ] ) can be used .",
    "the new probability maximization conditions are @xmath178 with @xmath179 equations ( [ extremiz1 ] ) ( one for each modulus ) determine , for any set of parameters @xmath99 , a region in moduli space for which the slow roll conditions are satisfied .",
    "of course , there may be some values of @xmath99 for which there is no solution .",
    "equation ( [ extremiz2 ] ) is then a further constraint that restricts the parameter values only to those that satisfy it .",
    "equations ( [ extremiz1])([nu2 ] ) , however , leave the system under - determined .",
    "the only exception is when there is only one parameter in the set @xmath99 .",
    "the logarithm of the wkb wave function at the point of emergence from the barrier into the lorentzian spacetime depends on the values of the moduli at this point @xmath180 and on @xmath181 , @xmath182 .",
    "\\label{aplus}\\ ] ] hence , it takes the following form in general @xmath183 the wave function should be extremized with respect to all the moduli as well as the parameters @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath82 depends on @xmath99 only through its dependence on the potential , we have @xmath184    in principle , these equations determine the tunneling end - point in the moduli space that serves as the initial values for the classical evolution of all the moduli .",
    "they also determine the discrete parameters , the fluxes , gauge group parameters , etc .. these equations therefore determine the particular flux configuration to which the tunneling occurs .",
    "of course , in general there may be more than one solution to these conditions , so their solution may be a multiverse rather than a universe .",
    "in practice we used the particular expression for @xmath82 that was obtained in eq .",
    "( [ elliptic ] ) for the case of a constant potential ( cc ) by arguing that the tunneling took place to a flat point on the potential .",
    "thus we argued that even with the moduli , the equations of sect .",
    "[ s : thermal ] could be used with the appropriate replacements for @xmath104 and @xmath106",
    ". equation ( [ extremiz2 ] ) then follows from imposing @xmath185 which implies that the whole set of equations ( [ ext1 ] ) , one for each parameter in the set @xmath99 , are satisfied .",
    "clearly this is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for extremization with respect to @xmath99",
    ". it would be interesting to explore the nature of the general solutions to the extremization equations .    in the next section",
    "we will investigate the nature of the restrictions that we have found for the specific potentials for moduli that have been suggested recently by kklt .",
    "we would like to determine more accurately the point on the moduli potential to which the universe tunnels . for this",
    "we need to input some additional information on the properties of the moduli potential .",
    "we will use here the kklt model @xcite . in this model",
    ", the potential has two contributions @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the first takes the form of an @xmath166 sugra potential ( using the same units as before ) with a kaehler potential given by eq .",
    "( [ kaehler ] ) and a superpotential @xmath188 the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ superpot ] ) come from the fluxes @xcite , @xmath152 and @xmath189 are functions of the complex structure moduli , and there is only one kaehler modulus @xmath10 .",
    "the third term in this expression can arise from gaugino condensation in a gauge group living on a stack of 7-branes wrapping a four cycle on the compact manifold .",
    "kklt assume that it is possible to ignore the third term and integrate out @xmath9 and the complex structure moduli , assuming a flux configuration which makes their masses heavy . while this is not strictly correct ( see @xcite ) the corrections are not important for the current discussion so we will ignore them",
    ". then @xmath9 and the complex structure moduli are constants , and the effective superpotential is of the form @xmath190 with a kaehler potential @xmath191 giving @xmath192 the minimum of @xmath186 is at @xmath193 , and for consistency with the assumption that the volume is large , and therefore that ten dimensional supergravity is valid , and for consistency with the expansion in non - perturbative terms , one needs @xmath194 , so that we need to have @xmath195 .",
    "this can be achieved by fine tuning the fluxes .",
    "the second contribution to the kklt potential @xmath187 comes from anti-@xmath196 branes and breaks supersymmetry explicitly from the 4d perspective .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath197 in a naive calculation of the anti - dbrane tension , however , a term proportional to @xmath198 has also been proposed in the literature .",
    "the total potential has a shallow positive minimum at a largish value of @xmath169 , and a small barrier separates it from a positive tail that goes to zero as @xmath199 .",
    "now let us check whether the end point of the tunneling can be on the asymptotic tail using the arguments of section [ ss : fastroll ] .",
    "the field @xmath169 is not canonically normalized .",
    "the canonically normalized field is @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "so the asymptotic dependence of the full potential on @xmath200 is @xmath202 .",
    "recall the discussion in sect .",
    "[ s : wdwscalar ] where we concluded that the ( euclidean ) cosmological scaling solution of a canonically normalized scalar field @xmath97 with an exponential potential @xmath203 gives a power law dependence for the scale factor @xmath204 , with @xmath205 . if @xmath206 , @xmath149 , the expansion is accelerated .",
    "recall also that for @xmath207 the prefactor @xmath152 needs to be negative for a scaling solution to exist . in the case",
    "that the potential goes like @xmath208 then @xmath209 or in the case that the potential goes like @xmath210 then @xmath211 , both significantly above @xmath212 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath213 is positive .",
    "hence we can conclude that these potentials do no lead to accelerated expansion .",
    "the argument of section [ ss : fastroll ] indicated that for the tunneling barrier to be finite , one needed an accelerating scale factor .",
    "our conclusion is therefore that the tunneling end point can not be on the asymptotic tail of the potential in the region @xmath214 where @xmath187 dominates .",
    "a possible loophole in the argument is that perhaps it is possible to find a transient solution that includes a brief period of accelerated expansion .",
    "however , also in this case the potential energy has to dominate the energy balance .",
    "then , ignoring numerical factors of order unity and since @xmath170 is fixed at a number of @xmath215 , eq.([extremiz2 ] ) leads to the condition @xmath216 as we discuss below , this relationship can not be satisfied since @xmath213 has to be very small , and the l.h.s . is not particularly small .",
    "hence it is not possible to satisfy the extremization conditions even in this case .",
    "if the anti - dbrane term is not included then the tail of the potential is steeper , and if a potential of the form @xmath217 is added then eq .  ( [ kkltconda ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath218 which is even harder satisfy .",
    "our conclusion is therefore valid for these additional cases .",
    "let us now check whether the tunneling end point can be near the shallow minimum , or near the maximum of the barrier separating the minimum from the asymptotic region .",
    "the dimensionless radiation @xmath106 is given by eq .",
    "( [ nu2 ] ) and the dimensionless potential by @xmath219 at the two extrema , the two terms are comparable . in the event that the tunneling occurs to an extremum , which we have argued is a reasonable approximation ,",
    "the wave function is extremized at points where @xmath106 and @xmath105 are related as in eq .",
    "( [ extremiz2 ] ) . in our case @xmath170 fixed at a number of @xmath215 .    equation ( [ extremiz2 ] ) gives @xmath220 where we have ignored a factor of @xmath215 .",
    "the factor @xmath221 is about @xmath222 , and is not expected to vary much with different flux choices . on the other hand , for models with one condensate ( i.e. one non - perturbative term as in the original kklt example ) and a small cc , both extrema are at quite large values of @xmath223 . for large values of @xmath224 the r.h.s . of eq.([kkltcond ] ) is much smaller than 1/10 .",
    "we conclude that eq.([kkltcond ] ) can not be satisfied at either extremum .",
    "for example , let us consider the choice of parameters in kklt , where @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 . although the normalization of the potential in kklt is somewhat different than ours , it is clear that the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ kkltcond ] ) is of order @xmath229 for the maximum , and much smaller for the minimum where the cc was tuned to be very small .",
    "our conclusion is that the quantum cosmology arguments would prefer a modified kklt model , with additional exponential terms in the superpotential to allow extrema that are closer to the central region of moduli space where eq .",
    "( [ extremiz2 ] ) has a chance to be obeyed .",
    "such models can be constructed by having several non - perturbative terms in the superpotential ( see , for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , it is easier to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ extremiz2 ] ) at a maximum , a saddle point , or a metastable minimum rather than at a global minimum .",
    "we have seen that the probability distribution obtained from the wave function of the universe can provide an interesting and restrictive dynamical selection principle on the landscape of string solutions without reference to the anthropic principle .",
    "we have proposed that the universe emerged from the string era in a thermally excited state above the hh vacuum , and determined , within a mini - superspace model , the probability of tunneling to different points on the landscape .",
    "we have clarified the significance of including a radiation term for the hh wave function of the universe and have shown that the radiation term switches the roles of the hartle - hawking and linde - vilenkin wave functions . we have found that the potential energy of the tunneling end point from which the universe emerges and begins its classical evolution , is determined by the primordial temperature , and that this starting point can be followed by some interesting dynamics .",
    "we have found that a more accurate treatment , even within the mini - superspace approximation , requires the inclusion of the moduli fields , and we have included them . by taking into account some generic properties of the moduli potential we then argue that the tunneling to the tail of the moduli potentials is disfavored , that the most likely emergence point is near an extremum , and that this extremum is not likely to be in the outer region of moduli space where the compact volume is very large and the string coupling very weak .",
    "combined , these considerations select a class of values of the flux parameters etc . ,",
    "that characterize a universe , or a multiverse , in the landscape .",
    "we explicitly demonstrated the applicability of our arguments for the kklt model of moduli stabilization .",
    "we have determined that for the kklt model the tunneling to the tail of the potential or to the vicinity of the barrier that separates the minimum from the asymptotic region is disfavored .",
    "our quantum cosmology arguments favor tunneling to an extremum of the potential that is close to the central region of moduli space as might be obtained from generalizations of the original kklt model .",
    "finally , we might consider the relevance of the counting program of douglas and collaborators @xcite to our arguments .",
    "we have calculated a quantity that is analogous to the square of the tunneling amplitude in the calculation of a decay rate of an unstable particle . to obtain the total tunneling rate",
    "one needs also the density of final states .",
    "perhaps the counting program can supply the latter , so that a complete calculation of the relative probabilities of finding one or another universe , or a certain subset of the multiverse , is obtained by taking the product of the two factors .",
    "the number density of solutions does not seem to influence much the preferred value of the cc , because the tunneling amplitude is sharply peaked as a function of the cc , while the number density of solutions is uniform as a function of the cc .",
    "perhaps it is more relevant to the preferred values of other dynamical parameters .",

    "r.b thanks pi for hospitality , sda thanks the department of physics , ben - gurion university for hospitality .",
    "here we explain the relation of our work to the calculations of sarangi and tye @xcite .",
    "sarangi and tye ( st ) have argued that the wave function needs to be modified due to decoherence effects .",
    "they argue that the fluctuations of the metric and of other light fields should be integrated out and traced over .",
    "their calculation is rather involved , but the final result can be justified and related to that in sect .",
    "[ s : thermal ] by the following simple argument .",
    "st are essentially computing the thermal partition function in a friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) background at some undefined temperature .",
    "it is well known that this calculation gives a contribution to the effective action ( free energy ) which is just the energy density of radiation i.e. a term proportional to @xmath230 .. this should in fact be identified with the inverse temperature - so in our notation their @xmath10 should be replaced by our @xmath231 . ]",
    "it is also well known that in the frw background the temperature scales as the inverse of the scale factor @xmath232 .",
    "so the only question is : what is the temperature ?",

    "the effect of the unobserved fluctuations can be represented by the entropy @xmath233 within a horizon volume .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the upper bound on this is ( a related though not identical calculation is performed by st ) @xmath234 where we have assumed as in @xcite that the infrared cutoff is the horizon size and the ultraviolet one is the string scale @xmath235 .",
    "also we have used the friedman equation to estimate @xmath236 . comparing to the entropy of a thermal state @xmath237",
