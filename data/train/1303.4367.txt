    "a wigner rotation corresponds to a momentum - dependent change of the spin state of a relativistic particle with a change of reference frame @xcite .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the imposition of the special relativistic space - time structure to quantum mechanics .",
    "it is thus deeply connected with the basic structure of the universe that , as far as we know , is both quantum and relativistic .",
    "the influence of the wigner rotations on the field of quantum information has been intensively investigated in the past 10 years @xcite . since the seminal paper of peres , scudo and terno @xcite , who concluded that because of the momentum - dependent wigner rotations the spin entropy of a relativistic particle is not a relativistic scalar , many works appeared in the literature discussing how the entropy @xcite and entanglement @xcite of the reduced spin state of a relativistic system change under lorentz transformations , as well as the influence of the wigner rotations on the violation of bell s inequalities with relativistic particles @xcite . however , in our previous works @xcite we showed that it is not possible to consistently define a reduced spin density matrix for a system with one or more relativistic particles , as it is done in most of the cited papers @xcite .    here",
    "we go further .",
    "we show that if , under a change of the reference frame , we simply linearly apply wigner rotations to the quantum state of a massive particle that is in a superposition of two counter - propagating momentum states and consider a general model for particle detection , we obtain a paradox that could , among other things , permit an instantaneous transmission of information between two arbitrarily separated regions of space .",
    "this is of course highly undesirable given that the whole point of imposing special relativity is to avoid action at a distance .",
    "a solution of the paradox is given here based on the physical interpretation of the wigner rotations recently given by us @xcite and on a discussion about the preparation method of the quantum state of the particle .",
    "in particular , we show that the wigner rotation depends on how the particle s quantum state is prepared , such that it is not possible to compute the rotation for each momentum component separately , a subtle consideration that removes the paradox . in other words , the solution we present for the paradox is based on the fact that the wigner rotation operation can not in general be linearly applied to an arbitrary superposition of different momentum states .",
    "our conclusions affect much of the literature on relativistic quantum information which has to be re - evaluated in order to avoid inconsistencies like the one to be presented here .",
    "consider that alice prepares a pair of relativistic massive spin-1/2 particles in the quantum state @xmath0+\\\\                                 & & -|p{\\mathbf}{\\hat{y}},-z\\rangle_1\\big[|p{\\mathbf}{\\hat{y}},+z\\rangle_2-|-p{\\mathbf}{\\hat{y}},+z\\rangle_2\\big]\\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in reference frame @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents a state for particle @xmath3 with 4-momentum @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , and spin state pointing in the @xmath6 direction , being the eigenvector of the pauli matrix @xmath7 with eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "we are using wigner s definition for spin @xcite , that refers to the particle angular momentum in the rest frame for each momentum component . from now on we will use a system of units in which the speed of light in vacuum is @xmath9 . in the above state particle 1",
    "has momentum @xmath10 , particle 2 is in a superposition of two counter - propagating momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the particles are in an singlet state of spin , which is a maximally entangled state .",
    "this state can be constructed , for instance , if there is a decay of a particle without spin into two spin-1/2 particles inside a potential well that retains only particle 2 and particle 1 propagates in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "this decay naturally produces a singlet state of spin and the potential",
    "well can be constructed such that particle 2 is stored with the above superposition of two counter - propagating momenta .",
    "the apparent paradox emerges if alice measures the spin of particle 1 in reference frame @xmath1 and bob , in a reference frame @xmath13 that moves with velocity @xmath14 in relation to @xmath1 , measures the position of particle 2 .",
    "when alice measures the spin of particle 1 , the spin of particle 2 `` collapses '' in the opposite direction .",
    "since bob is in another reference frame , with the change of reference frame wigner rotations @xcite act on the spin state of particle 2 .",
    "a wigner rotation depends on the momentum of the particle , so the two momentum components of particle 2 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , may generate different rotations for the particle spin , causing a correlation between spin and momentum in bob s reference frame . as we show in the following , using the formalism which is generally used by the relativistic quantum information community , this correlation may affect the probability of finding particle 2 in different regions of space in a way that depends on the basis that alice uses to measure the spin of particle 1 .",
    "so , if alice and bob share a set of particles prepared in state ( [ entstate ] ) , this would permit that bob discovers the basis chosen by alice to measure her particles in an arbitrary distant place by measuring the position of his particles , what would permit alice to instantaneously transmit one bit of information to bob .",
    "of course this is impossible , so there must be a failure in the treatment . as we discuss below , we believe that the culprit is a careless linear application of the wigner rotations .",
    "let us first consider that alice , having a pair of particles in the state ( [ entstate ] ) , makes a measurement of the @xmath15 component of the spin of particle 1 and obtains @xmath16 .",

    "it is in the foldy - wouthuysen representation that the pauli matrix @xmath7 is the @xmath18 component of the mean spin operator of a relativistic particle as we consider in this work @xcite .",
    "the components of the particle 2 wavefunction with mean spin state @xmath19 in the mean position representation can be written as @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a factor that depends on the specific position operator that we use . since the state of eq .",

    "if we make a change of reference frame to a frame @xmath13 that moves with velocity @xmath24 in relation to @xmath1 , each momentum component of the state ( [ state_z_s0 ] ) suffers a different spin transformation due to the dependence of the wigner rotation with the particle momentum .",

    "it is important to reinforce that , as we showed in our previous work @xcite , it is not possible to consistently define a reduced density matrix for the spin of a relativistic particle as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , since it is not possible to measure the particle spin independently of its momentum in a relativistic setting .",
    "however , in principle it is possible to measure the momentum of a relativistic particle independently of its spin , such that the definition of a reduced momentum state should be reasonable .",

    "( [ state_z_s0 ] ) and ( [ state_x_s0 ] ) do represent free - particle solutions , the construction of such states needs the presence of a potential barrier , such that the simply application of the wigner rotation to each momentum component is not a valid procedure ( i.e. we are no longer in the domain of special relativity since the potential barrier accelerates the particle ) .    to understand why this is the case , we can make use of the physical interpretation of the wigner rotations recently given by us @xcite , that says that these rotations are a consequence of the fact that different observers compute different quantization axes for a spin measurement .",
    "this interpretation is supported by a recent work from palmer _",
    "et al . _ that presents a detailed analysis of the stern - gerlach measurement process in a relativistic setting @xcite . to compute the wigner rotation for the state of eq .

    "let us first consider a situation in which the state of eq .",
    "( [ state_z_s0 ] ) is obtained trough measurements on particle 2 directly , without considering particle 1 . to construct the state",
    ", one can make a spin measurement on a particle that propagates in the @xmath77 direction with a stern - gerlach apparatus with magnetic field in the @xmath78 direction , obtaining eigenvalue @xmath38 .",
    "after that , the particle is sent to a region that has a potential barrier that reflects its wavefunction and produces the standing wave pattern . in this case",
    ", the moving observer will describe the wigner rotation for both momentum components of the wavefuntion , with values @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as the one for a free particle with momentum @xmath79 , since the spin measurement is made when the particle has momentum @xmath79 and the particle spin should not change with the reflection on the potential barrier .",
    "analogously , if the spin measurement is made while the particle propagates in the @xmath81 direction , the wigner rotation is the one of a free particle with momentum @xmath80 for both momentum components .",
    "if , on the other hand , the particle is confined in a potential well with both momentum components @xmath79 and @xmath80 while the spin measurement is made , the quantization axis is given by the average field seen by the particle , such that no wigner rotation occurs with the change of reference frame .",
    "in the three examples of the particle state preparation described in the previous paragraph , the wigner rotation is the same for both momentum components of the state of eq .",
    "( [ state_z_s0 ] ) , such that after tracing out spin the spatial wavefunction is pure , as in the case of the state of eq .",
    "( [ state_x_s0 ] ) .",
    "so the probability of finding the particle in different regions is the same in the new reference frame , no matter its spin state .",
    "let us now come back to the physical situation described by the quantum state of eq .",
    "( [ entstate ] ) . to compute the wigner rotations acting on particle 2 with the change of reference frame",
    ", we must consider how this quantum state is prepared .",
    "if the physical state is the result of the decay of a particle without spin into two spin-1/2 particles in the rest frame of the original particle , then particle 2 is emitted with momentum @xmath11 and reflects and back and forth on the potential well walls forming the interference pattern . according to the interpretation described in the previous paragraphs for the wigner rotations , with the change of reference frame both momentum components of the particle wavefunction",
    "must suffer a wigner rotation corresponding to the @xmath11 momentum , since the reflections on the potential barriers do not affect the particle spin .",
    "so the spatial wavefunction of particle 2 is pure no matter what measurement is made by alice , such that probabilities for bob to find particle 2 in different regions of space are always the same , a fact that solves the paradox .",
    "before concluding , we would like to briefly discuss the influence of the wigner rotations on the detection of genuine free particles states in different reference frames .",
    "a particle in a superposition of momenta @xmath82 in the @xmath34 direction in the reference frame @xmath1 , for instance , is what we call a genuine free particle state , since the state can be constructed without reflections of the wavefunction , with a uniform potential in the whole space .",
    "we will consider here that the spatial wavefunction @xmath83 is given by eq .",

    "the difference between the two cases is very small , specially when it is considered that the detection probability corresponds to the integral of the square modulus of the wavefunction in regions greater than @xmath88 . this difference does not increase much by choosing other values for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "however , the probabilities of finding the particle in each region must be exactly the same in both situations , otherwise a paradox similar to the one previously discussed would appear .",
    "so , if in some cases the difference is found to be above the quantum fluctuations , this indicates that the definition of the wavefunction and/or detection probability used are non - physical .     in the @xmath34 direction seen from a observer moving with velocity @xmath91",

    "to summarize , we have shown that the linear application of the momentum - dependent wigner rotations to the quantum state of a massive relativistic particle in a superposition of counter - propagating momentum states in combination with a general model for particle detection leads to a paradox .",
    "the paradox can be stated as an apparent consequence of the imposition of the special relativity structure to quantum mechanics implying that the wigner rotations could permit an instantaneous transmission of information between two spatially separated parties , thereby violating special relativity .",
    "considering the physical implementation of the quantum state , we discussed that the wigner rotation depends on the preparation method , such that , with a change of the reference frame , the spin transformation of a state in a superposition of different momenta is not necessarily equivalent to the linear application of the momentum - dependent wigner rotation to each momentum component of the state , a conclusion that solves the paradox .",
    "the present work , together with our previous works on the subject @xcite , show that relativistic quantum transformations can not in general be computed only by following a mathematical procedure .",
    "the physical meaning of the transformations must always take precedence .",
    "it is worth to mention that it may be possible that by modeling the particle detection by some more complicated scheme the paradox could be solved keeping the linearity of the wigner rotations . but note that the position operator would have a very complicated dependence on the particle momenta and spin in this case . although we do not rule out such possibility , we believe that the solution we present for the paradox is more reasonable due to its simplicity and clear physical interpretation in the relativistic quantum information context .",
