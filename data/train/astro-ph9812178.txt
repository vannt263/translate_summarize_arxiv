    "the discovery by wiklind &  combes of high - redshift molecular absorption toward four radio sources provides a novel approach of studying the dense interstellar medium of galaxies at cosmological distances . in two of the detected sources , 1504 + 377 and 1413 + 135",

    ", one observes a wide variety of absorption lines from a series of high dipole moment species that are well - known constituents of molecular clouds within the milky way ( wiklind &  combes 1996b , 1998 ) .",
    "here we report interferometric observations targeted at understanding the spatial distribution and chemical composition of the absorbing clouds observed toward b0218 + 357 and pks  1830@xmath0211 .",
    "we have used the vla to search for absorption from a number of molecules toward b0218 + 357 and pks  1830@xmath0211 . in particular , the @xmath6 rotational ground state lines from the high dipole moment species hco@xmath7 , hcn , and hnc , which are detected toward many milky way molecular clouds , have rest frequencies in the 3 mm band that are redshifted into the 3849 ghz range covered by the vla s `` new '' highest frequency receivers for @xmath8  1.3 . at the time of our observations ,",
    "13 vla antennas were equipped with 3849 ghz receivers . toward pks  1830@xmath0211 ,",
    "we detected absorption from the @xmath9 lines of the three molecules mentioned , as well as from the analogous transitions of their @xmath10c - substituted isotopomers .",
    "in addition , we detected absorption from the c@xmath11h@xmath12 , hc@xmath11n , h@xmath12co , and c@xmath12h molecules .",
    "our vla observations allow for accurate optical depth determinations .",
    "moreover , since some of our observations used the highest resolution a configuration , we are able to image the pks  1830@xmath0211 system at @xmath13 resolution .",
    "the observations described here are part of an extensive program of studying molecular absorption toward pks  1830@xmath0211 and b0218 + 357 that also includes observations with the iram interferometer , the effelsberg 100 m telescope , and the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",

    "1 shows a 47.0 ghz vla map of the pks  1830@xmath0211 gravitational lens system made with a resolution of @xmath13 .",
    "two compact sources , in the following referred to as the ne and sw images , with weak extended `` tails '' are seen , displaying the inversion symmetry expected from gravitational lensing of a core / jet source . with decreasing frequency",
    ", the jet components grow larger ( rao &  subrahmanyan 1988 ; subrahmanyan et al .",
    "1990 ) and form an einstein ring ( jauncey et al .",
    "1991 ) , which is _ not _ resolved in our @xmath14 resolution 7.7 ghz map shown in the lower left panel of fig . 1 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1 are spectra of the hcn @xmath15 line made toward both images .",
    "strong absorption with a peak optical depth @xmath16 is observed at zero velocity ( assuming @xmath17 ) toward the compact core of the sw image , while much weaker absorption is observed in the same transition toward the ne image at a 147  lower velocity .",
    "this general distribution of the hcn absorption is consistent with the results obtained for the @xmath18 line of this molecule by frye , welch , &  broadhurst ( 1997 ) and wiklind &  combes ( 1998 ) .",
    "our higher resolution vla observations , together with vlba data on the @xmath19 line ( redshifted to 24.1 ghz ; carilli et al .",
    "1998 ) allow for a more detailed analysis of the spatial structure of the molecular absorption toward pks  1830@xmath0211(sw ) . as discussed by carilli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the  absorption is arising from a region of size larger than 2.5 milliarcseconds or @xmath20 pc , where @xmath21 is the hubble constant in units of 100  mpc@xmath22 and @xmath23 is assumed .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath24 pc on the size of the absorbing cloud follows from the fact that we do not detect hcn absorption toward the tail of sw image with an upper limit on the optical depth of 0.3 .",
    "as discussed by wiklind &  combes ( 1998 ) , the observed difference in absorption velocities between the sw and ne images allows for tight constraints on the lens mass distribution and , thus , lensing models of pks  1830@xmath0211 ( see kochanek & narayan 1992 ; nair , narasimha , &  rao 1993 ) .",
    "wiklind &  combes ( 1998 ) derive @xmath25  for the rotation velocity , @xmath26 , of the @xmath27 lensing galaxy .",
    "the `` effective distance '' @xmath28 , measured in gpc , is equal to @xmath29 ; where @xmath30 is the distance between the observer and the lens , @xmath31 the distance between the observer and the source , and @xmath32 the distance between the lens and the source .",
    "all distances are angular diameter distances .",
    "very recently , a value of 2.507 has been measured for the redshift of the lensed source in the pks  1830@xmath0211 system ( see the report by lidman 1998 ) , yielding @xmath33  and an inclination angle , @xmath34 , of 16@xmath35 ( @xmath36 = 75  mpc@xmath22 and @xmath23 are assumed throughout this paper ) .",
    "this indicates that the lensing galaxy is a massive early - type spiral .",
    "there is , however , the possible complication of multiple lensing , which might be expected , given the presence of an hi absorption system at a redshift of 0.1927 ( lovell et al .",

    "we find that to within the uncertainties of a few k , the thus determined rotation temperatures , @xmath47 , are consistent with the value of the cosmic microwave background temperature , @xmath48 , at @xmath1 .",
    "all of the species observed by us have high dipole moments ( see table 1 ) . even for the relatively low frequency  lines ,",
    "the critical densities necessary for thermalization of the level populations at or near the kinetic temperature , @xmath49 , are @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , the low rotation temperatures indicate subthermal excitation due to a relatively low total density of the absorbing cloud rather than low kinetic temperatures , which for molecular clouds within the milky way are generally greater than 10 k.    given that @xmath52 , the accurate optical depth determinations afforded by our interferometer measurements allow for a meaningful estimate of the cosmic microwave background temperature at @xmath1 , for which big bang theory predicts a value of @xmath53 k = 5.14 k. in particular , from the  @xmath54 and @xmath55 spectra shown in fig .",

    "the galactic clouds in question are the cold , dense dark clouds tmc-1 and l  183 and the more diffuse clouds seen against the extragalactic radio sources 3c111 and nrao  150 .",

    "most of the absorbing clouds seen toward nrao  150 are quite dense compared to `` typical '' diffuse clouds studied , e.g. , by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy and probably have [ co / h@xmath12 ] abundance ratios exceeding @xmath65 . by comparison , for the diffuse cloud sample discussed by federman et al .",
    "( 1994 ; see also liszt &  lucas 1998 ) [ co / h@xmath12 ] abundance ratios range from a few times @xmath66 to a few times @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear from table 1 that the pks  1830@xmath0211 absorbing cloud has a total column density and molecular abundances that are quite similar to the values found in galactic dark clouds ( note that c@xmath11h@xmath12 and  are anomalously over - abundant in tmc-1 by galactic molecular cloud standards ) .",
    "the @xmath17 cloud does not show the surprisingly high abundances of , hcn , and  relative to co found in the more diffuse galactic clouds seen in absorption toward 3c111 and nrao  150 and other sources , which are , particularly in the case of , a challenge to current models of diffuse cloud chemistry ( turner 1994 ; liszt &  lucas 1995 ) .",
    "while there are chemical similarities , a comparison of cloud structure in space and velocity reveals remarkable differences between the @xmath68 absorbing cloud and typical galactic dark clouds such as tmc-1 or l  183 .",
    "assume that for the pks  1830@xmath0211 ( sw ) cloud the abundance ratios of , say , the widespread co , , and hcn molecules relative to   are similar to the values found for galactic dark clouds .",
    "this implies a total molecular hydrogen column density of a few times @xmath5 .",
    "assuming further that the molecular hydrogen density is smaller than @xmath69 , as implied by the subthermal excitation of all of the high dipole moment species , we derive a pathlength larger than @xmath70 pc along the line of sight , which is to be compared with the 13 pc _ lower _ limit of the source size in the plane of the sky indicated by the vlba results of carilli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discussed above . to compare with galactic molecular clouds , it is instructive to take as a reference source the nearby and well - studied taurus / auriga dark cloud complex ( see , e.g. , cernicharo 1991 ) , which has a total extent of @xmath71 pc , while individual clouds within that complex , such as tmc-1 , have sizes of one to a few pc . the line widths in such clouds are @xmath72 , and radial velocities are within @xmath70  of a median value , with only a few  variation over the whole extent of the complex .",
    "in contrast , from , e.g. , the high quality spectrum of the optically thin  absorption line ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , we find that the @xmath68 absorption covers a total velocity range of @xmath73  ( fwzp ) , which is significantly larger than the velocity spread even of a galactic giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , with the exception of the remarkable gmcs found within @xmath74 pc of the galactic center .",
    "the latter clouds have velocity widths that are comparable to that of the @xmath68 absorber .",
    "we note that compared to the distance of these gmcs to the galactic center , the cloud absorbing pks  1830@xmath0211 ( sw ) is located much further away from the center of the lensing galaxy , 1.8 kpc in the context of the model of nair et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and 3 kpc in the model by kochanek &  narayan ( 1992 ) .",
    "this possibly indicates significant differences in molecular cloud structure and composition between the @xmath17 lensing galaxy of pks  1830@xmath0211 and the milky way .",
    "2 shows spectra of the redshifted @xmath15 transitions of hcn , hnc , and  together with spectra of the analogous transitions from the @xmath10c - substituted isotopomers . of the three main isotopic lines",
    ", the hnc line has the lowest optical depth ( @xmath75 ) , affording , together with the optically thin h@xmath10cn line , a meaningful estimate of the [ @xmath76c/@xmath10c ] ratio ; we find a value of @xmath77 .",
    "the [ @xmath76c/@xmath10c ] ratios determined from hcn and  are consistent with this number .",
    "while the [ @xmath76c/@xmath10c ] ratio in the @xmath17 cloud is smaller than the values found in the solar system and the local interstellar medium , [ @xmath76c/@xmath10c ] ratios around 50 are measured for inner galaxy clouds within 4 kpc of the galactic center , while the galactic center clouds themselves have even smaller values around 20 ( see wilson &  matteucci 1992 ; wilson &  rood 1994 ) .",
    "@xmath10c is only produced in low and intermediate mass stars , while @xmath76c is also produced in massive stars .",
    "thus , the [ @xmath76c/@xmath10c ] ratio is expected to decrease in time and with increasing stellar processing ( see the discussion of wilson &  matteucci 1992 ) . the relatively low value measured at @xmath17 may thus be of interest in the context of chemical evolution studies .",
    "however , we note that we only sample one line of sight in the lensing galaxy , which might have an atypical chemical history .",
    "we also searched unsuccessfully for absorption the dcn @xmath78 transition .",
    "our upper limit and other searches for deuterated molecules toward pks  1830@xmath0211 are discussed by shah et al .",

    "formaldehyde ( ) was first observed toward the einstein ring b0218 + 357 in its 2 cm rest wavelength  @xmath79-doublet transition by menten &  reid ( 1996 ) , who found absorption toward the south - western of the two compact images of the background source , labeled a in fig . 4 ( see also patnaik et al .",
    "1993 and patnaik &  porcas , this volume , for a description of the radio continuum morphology ) .",
    "the  absorption occurs at @xmath80 , the same redshift at which wiklind &  combes ( 1995 ) detect absorption from other molecules .",
    "the populations of the  and  @xmath79-doublet transitions at 6 and 2 cm wavelength , respectively , are sensitively dependent on the  density and these lines are usually anti - inverted .",
    "statistical equilibrium calculations yield excitation temperatures and optical depths , so that comparisons with observations in principle allow meaningful estimates of the molecular hydrogen density ( see , e.g. , henkel , walmsley , &  wilson 1980 ) .",
    "while both the 6 and the 2 cm transitions have now been detected toward b0218 + 357 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , their interpretation is complicated by the fact that the extent and intensity of the background continuum emission is strongly dependent on the observing frequency ( see patnaik &  porcas , this volume ) .",
    "modeling of the  excitation will be greatly aided by vlbi observations and determinations of the excitation temperatures of the 6 cm and 2 cm lines , which can be extracted from observations of millimeter - wavelength lines interconnecting the energy levels of the centimeter lines ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . for this reason",
    ", we have also observed a number of millimeter - wavelength  transitions toward . while spectra for several lines are shown in fig .",
    "4 , the results of our model calculations will be presented in a future publication .",
    "since we have observed both ortho- and para-  lines , our observations allow an estimate of the ortho - to - para ratio , which should be 3 if the  was formed in warm gas ( @xmath81 k ) or on hot dust grain surfaces and @xmath82 for formation in cold gas or on cold grain surfaces .    from a preliminary analysis of the  para- and the @xmath83 ortho - transition ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , we derive an ortho - to - para  ratio of @xmath84 . systematic uncertainties of this value are likely to be small , since , contrary to the case of the low frequency @xmath79-doublet transitions mentioned above , the covering factors of the two millimeter - wavelength transitions used in its derivation should be very similar .",
