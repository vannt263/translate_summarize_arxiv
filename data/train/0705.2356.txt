    "there have been important progresses in understanding the structure of the proton recently . the jeffereson lab hall a collaboration @xcite obtained the ratio of the proton s elastic electromagnetic form factors @xmath3 by the measuring the polarization transfers",
    ", whose result showed that the ratio decreases systematically as @xmath4 increases from 0.5 to 3.5 @xmath5 .",
    "the babar collaboration @xcite measured , using the initial state radiation , the @xmath6 mass dependence of the ratio of the time - like proton electric and magnetic form factors and found that the ratio is significantly larger than 1 for masses up to 2.2 gev .",
    "these new experimental results are more accurate than previous ones and show the @xmath7 dependences of the form factors which are different from old experimental results",
    ". these progresses are valuable for improving our understanding of the nucleon structure and motivate theoretical and experimental exploration on the hadronic structures .",
    "we are interested in the time - like nucleon form factors .",
    "they have imaginary parts , differently from the space - like form factors , and their complex phases can be measured by finding out the single - spin asymmetry , @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is defined as the polarization of the produced nucleon in the direction normal to the production plane .",
    "the dependence of @xmath8 on the models of the nucleon form factors were presented in @xcite .",
    "this single - spin asymmetry may be measured at the future gsi @xmath6 experiment and the up - graded dafne experiment .",
    "also , one can measure such @xmath9 of produced @xmath0 particles at the present b - factories by measuring the angular distribution of the daughter particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we interpret the single - spin asymmetry , @xmath8 , in terms of the structure function of the symmetric spin - dependent hadronic tensor , which has its origin in the final - state strong - interaction phases .",
    "we call this structure function @xmath12",
    ". existence of @xmath12 permits single - spin asymmetries not only in the exclusive processes but also in the inclusive processes without violating the @xmath13-invariance in the time - like reactions since @xmath12 can be made from the final - state interactions in the time - like reactions .",
    "if the single - spin asymmetry effect in the inclusive @xmath0 production process in addition to the exclusive @xmath0 production processs is sizeable , its effect in both processes can be measured at the present b - factories , and then the structure function @xmath12 can be extracted . in particular , the results for @xmath0 will be useful for the studies of the nucleon structure .",
    "we can expect that the sizes of these single - spin asymmetries are around 15 to 20 % since that of the process @xmath14 is of that size @xcite .",
    "symmetric spin - dependent structure function has been discussed in various contexts previously .",
    "christ and lee @xcite proposed to test the @xmath13-invariance by measuring the correlation function @xmath15 in the inelastic scattering @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the polarization vector of the initial nucleon @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the initial and final momenta of the lepton @xmath21 , @xmath22 all possible final states .",
    "they noted that this @xmath13-non - invariant correlation by the single - photon exchange is independent of the sign of the lepton charge , whereas such a @xmath13-invariant correlation by the interference between the single - photon and the two - photon exchange processes is proportional to the sign of the lepton charge .",
    "christ and lee also showed that the unpolarized nucleon target can produce spin - asymmetry .",
    "gourdin @xcite introduced the symmetric spin - dependent hadronic tensor in his study of the space - like deep inelastic scattering of the longitudinally polarized leptons from polarized nucleons .",
    "he noted that this symmetric spin - dependent hadronic tensor measures a violation of the time reversal invariance .",
    "these argument can be applied to time - like processes by crossing and annihilation of lepton  anti - lepton pair into baryons can produce spin - polarized baryon .",
    "unified understanding of single - spin asymmetries in electron - proton scattering process and electron - positron annihilation process in terms of symmetric spin - dependent structure function extends naturally to inclusive processes as well because the structure function , @xmath12 is allowed by the lorentz symmetry . in this paper",
    "we investigate the single - spin asymmetries in the inclusive and exclusive processes of electron - proton scattering and electron - positron annihilation .",
    "these single - spin asymmetries are presented in a unified manner through a symmetric spin - dependent hadronic tensor .",
    "it should be important to measure the single - spin asymmetries in both inclusive and exclusive processes for the @xmath0 production at the present b - factories , which will lead to the first measurement of the structure function of the symmetric spin - dependent hadronic tensor .",
