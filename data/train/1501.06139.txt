    "modeling the mechanical properties of amorphous solids is an active subject of current research , requiring detailed understanding of the many - body processes that occur in such system when subjected to external strains .",
    "external strains can be mechanical , magnetic or electric , depending on the properties of the amorphous solid in question .",
    "the responses of amorphous solids to such external strains is usually not smooth , giving rise to `` serrated '' plots of stress vs. strain , energy vs. strain , magnetization vs. external magnetic field etc .",
    "a lot of effort was spent on characterizing the probability distribution functions of such serrated responses . in the context of magnetic jumps",
    "this is referred to as barkhausen noise @xcite but other serrated noises were studied as well @xcite . in a number of cases",
    "strong claims of universality were made .",
    "recently we have analyzed in some detail model amorphous solids in which there is a significant coupling between mechanical and magnetic properties @xcite .",
    "doing so we realized that the characterization of the physics of plastic events can be quite demanding ; there is more in these events than what meets the eye at first impression .",
    "the aim of this paper is to highlight the somewhat complex anatomy of plastic events in such systems , with a word of caution to researchers in the field that similar complexity may arise in other systems as well , and reasonable modeling should take this into account . in particular we will conclude below that in general one should not expect universal probability distribution functions since the statistics of the serrated responses depend on many details of the microscopic interactions and on the state of the system .    deferring all details to the next section",
    ", we motivate the present paper by showing in fig .",
    "[ delu ] a scatter plot of the values of energy drops @xmath0 during plastic events when the system is strained by an external magnetic field .",
    "the scatter plot is shown as a function of the magnetization jump @xmath1 that occurs simultaneously with the energy drop .",
    "first , one sees that for a given @xmath1 one has a wide distribution of @xmath0 values .",
    "second , these values of the energy drops fall in different groups , with a strange intense line and two triangular groups that are only partly overlapping .",
    "understanding such scatter plots and their implications on the physics of the solid is what we mean by  the anatomy of plastic events \" .",
    "a theory of plasticity in such system should include also the understanding of the statistical distribution of such events . the density of points in every little box of size @xmath2 infig .",
    "[ delu ] is proportional to the joint probability @xmath3 .",
    "understanding how this probability distribution function is determined by the different physical process requires a theory of the anatomy of plastic events .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide such a theory for one particular model of amorphous magnetic glass .",
    "other models will require a similar approach .    in sect .",
    "[ model ] we present the model that was introduced recently and analyzed for some of its aspects in refs .",
    "the next section [ plast ] deals with the notion of plastic events , both under external mechanical strain and under external magnetic field .",
    "the anatomy of the plastic events that occur under magnetic straining is studied in section [ anat ] , in which we provide the numerical analysis , a theory , and a comparison between the two . in sect .",
    "[ mechstrain ] we discuss briefly the anatomy of plastic events under mechanical straining , including the implications to magnetostriction .",
    "the last section offers a summary and a discussion .",
    "the model hamiltonian was introduced in @xcite and analyzed further in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic part of the model is in the spirit of the harris , plischke and zuckerman ( hpz ) hamiltonian @xcite but with a number of important modifications .",
    "these modification were made to bring the model closer to the physics of amorphous magnetic solids @xcite .",
    "the first major difference is that the particles in the present case are not pinned to a lattice .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the 2-dimensional positions of @xmath6 particles in an area @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spin variables .",
    "the mechanical part @xmath9 is chosen to represent a glassy material with a binary mixture of 65% particles a and 35% particles b , with lennard - jones potentials having a minimum at positions @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the corresponding interacting particles @xcite .",
    "these values are chosen to guarantee good glass formation and avoidance of crystallization .",
    "the energy parameters chosen are @xmath13 @xmath14 , in units for which the boltzmann constant equals unity .",
    "all the potentials are truncated at distance 2.5@xmath15 with two continuous derivatives .",
    "@xmath16 particles a carry spins @xmath8 ; the @xmath17 b particles are not magnetic .",
    "of course @xmath18 .",
    "we choose the spins @xmath8 to be classical @xmath19 spins ; the orientation of each spin is then given by an angle @xmath20 with respect to the direction of the external magnetic field which is along the @xmath21 axis .",
    "the magnetic part of the potential energy takes the form @xcite : @xmath22 here @xmath23 and the sums are only over the a particles that carry spins .",
    "notice that in the present model the exchange parameter @xmath24 is a function of a changing inter - particle position ( either due to affine motions induced by an external strain or an external magnetic field or due to non - affine particle displacements , and see below ) .",
    "thus randomness in the exchange interaction is coming from the random positions @xmath25 , whereas the function @xmath24 is not random .",
    "we choose the monotonically decreasing form @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "this choice cuts off @xmath29 at @xmath30 with two smooth derivatives .",
    "note that we need to have at least two smooth derivatives in order to compute the hessian matrix below . finally , in our case @xmath31 .",
    "another major difference with the hpz model is that in the present case the local axis of anisotropy @xmath32 is _ not _ selected randomly , but is determined by the local structure .",
    "recall that in a crystalline solid the easy axis is determined by the symmetries of the lattice . in",
    "an amorphous solid the arrangement of particles changes from one position to the other , and we need to find the local easy axis by taking this local structure into account .",
    "define the matrix @xmath33 : @xmath34 note that we sum over all the particles that are within the range of @xmath35 ; this is sufficient to take into account the arrangement of the local neighborhood of the @xmath36th particle .",
    "the matrix @xmath33 has two eigenvalues in 2-dimensions that we denote as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the eigenvector that belongs to the larger eigenvalue @xmath37 is denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "the easy axis of anisotropy is given by @xmath41 .",
    "finally the coefficient @xmath42 which now changes from particle to particle is defined as @xmath43 ^ 2 ( \\kappa_{i,1}-\\kappa_{i,2})^2\\ , ~~ \\tilde c= k_0/j_0\\sigma^4_{ab } \\ .\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath44 determines the strength of this random local anisotropy term compared to other terms in the hamiltonian . for most of the data shown below we chose @xmath45 .",
    "the form given by eq .",
    "( [ kk ] ) ensures that for an isotropic distribution of particles @xmath46 . due to the glassy random nature of our material the direction",
    "@xmath32 is random .",
    "in fact we will assume below ( as can be easily tested in the numerical simulations ) that the angles @xmath32 are distributed randomly in the interval @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note that ramping the magnetic field does not change this flat distribution and we will assert that the probability distribution @xmath48 can be simply taken as @xmath49 we have checked in the numerical simulations that eq .",
    "( [ ptheta ] ) is valid to a high approximation at all values of @xmath50 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ magu ] ) is the interaction with the external field @xmath50 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath51 in the range [ -0.08,0.08 ] .",
    "at the two extreme values all the spins are aligned along the direction of @xmath52 .",
    "in passing we should comment on the chosen parameters in the model .",
    "our guiding line was to choose parameters such that the magnetostriction coefficient is of the order of what is known in laboratory materials .",
    "decreasing @xmath44 results in much smaller magnetostriction coefficients and vice versa .",
    "we did not aim at modeling a particular material , and our interest here , as before , is in the generic properties of amorphous solids with strong local anisotropy .",
    "it is well known that plasticity in crystalline solids is carried by defects , like dislocations , whose glide under external strains is dissipative , leading to energy loss . what are the mechanisms of energy loss in amorphous solids is less well known , although research in the last two decades has shed considerable light on the fundamental physics of plasticity in amorphous solids @xcite . in the present system we can have two distinct external agents that can strain the system , i.e. mechanical strain and magnetic field .",
    "such external strain can be studied in systems having finite or zero temperature .",
    "since we are interested in the anatomy of plastic events we opt for the latter , temperature fluctuations tend to mask the clear cut plastic events that are recognized at @xmath53 . to keep the system at @xmath53 we must also ramp the external strain or the magnetic field quasistatically to allow the system to remain in mechanical equilibrium at all times , without heating effects . in such conditions",
    "it is completely clear what are the instabilities that are responsible to plastic events .",
    "the response of our system to external strain , be it mechanical or magnetic , is reversible and smooth as long as the system is mechanically and magnetically stable .",
    "this is the case as long as the hessian matrix @xmath54 has only positive eigenvalues . in the present case",
    "@xmath54 takes on the form @xcite : @xmath55 the system loses stability when at least one of the eigenvalues of @xmath54 goes to zero .",
    "when this happens , there appears an instability that results in a discontinues change in stress , in energy and in magnetization . in fig .",
    "[ changes ] we show a typical blown up section of the energy , magnetization and stress curves as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "we see that the discontinuities appear simultaneously in all the three quantities at the same values of @xmath50 .",
    "these are irreversible plastic events that take the system from one minimum in the energy landscape through a saddle - node bifurcation to another minimum in the energy landscape where again all the eigenvalues of @xmath54 are positive . in ref .",
    "@xcite we derived an exact equation for the dependence of any eigenvalue @xmath56 on @xmath50 for a fixed external strain , which reads : @xmath57}{\\lambda_\\ell } .",
    "\\label{diff}\\ ] ] the precise definition of all the coefficients is given explicitly in ref .",
    "generically , when one eigenvalue , say @xmath58 approaches zero , all the other terms in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) remain bounded , leading to the approximate equation @xmath59 in such generic situations the eigenvalue is expected to vanish following a square - root singularity , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the value of the external magnetic field where the eigenvalue vanishes",
    ". the reader should be aware of the fact that at some special values of @xmath50 it may happen that the coefficient const in eq .",
    "[ sqsing ] vanishes at the instability leading to a an exponent different from 1/2 @xcite .",
    "this non generic feature hardly changes the considerations of the present paper .    in fig .",
    "[ instab ] we show a typical dependence of the eigenvalue @xmath58 on @xmath50 , where the square - root singularity is apparent .",
    "it is also interesting to examine what happens to the eigenfunctions @xmath62 which are associated with the eigenvalues @xmath56 as the instability is approached .",
    "the answer is that all the eigenfunctions of @xmath54 are delocalized far from the instability , but the one eigenfunction @xmath63 associated with @xmath64 gets localized on @xmath65 particles .",
    "a typical projection of @xmath63 close to the instability on the particles positions and on the spins is shown in the two panels of fig .",
    "[ proj ] .    we see that the non - affine movement of the particles is very similar to the standard",
    " eshelby like \" quadrupolar event that is so typical to amorphous solids .",
    "the projection on the spin degrees of freedom shows that a patch of spins had changed its orientation ( magnetic flip of a domain ) .",
    "note that the patch is compact , without any fractal or other esoteric characteristics that were associated with barkhausen noise in the past .",
    "this is the nature of the event that is associated with the barkhausen noise in our case .",
    "the reader should be aware however of the fact that the addition of long range dipole - dipole interactions can change this qualitatively , leading to elongated magnetic domains and a different mechanism of barkhausen noise due to the movement of domain boundaries @xcite .",
    "the interesting physics of plasticity in this model stems from the fact that the hessian matrix ( [ hesa ] ) couples the positional to the magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "thus a plastic drop in stress and energy will be usually coupled also to a change in the magnetization . whether one strains the system with a mechanical strain or a magnetic field , the plastic drops will be composite processes in which all the degrees of freedom contribute to the non - affine response . in this section",
    "we focus on these events that are triggered by the magnetic field as the straining agent . to expose the anatomy of the plastic events we re - plot the data in fig .",
    "[ changes ] in a different way , i.e. as a scatter plot of the drops in energy or in stress as a function of the magnetization change @xmath1 .",
    "the first was shown in fig .",
    "[ delu ] and the second is shown here as fig .",
    "[ delsig ] .    as before ,",
    "we see that also the values of the stress drops organize into two distinct groups that are however not non - overlapping .",
    "our first task is to rationalize the distributions that appears in figures like figs .",
    "[ delu ] and [ delsig ] . focussing as an example on the energy drops , we return to the hamiltonian and find out which of the terms is responsible to which group of energy drop values in these figures .",
    "this separation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ anatdelu ] , where the energy drop is assigned to four different contributions to the hamiltonian , i.e. the lennard - jones positional degrees of freedom , the exchange interaction , the anisotropy energy and finally the interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "obviously the combination of the scatter plots in fig .",
    "[ anatdelu ] will lead to what was shown as fig .",
    "the same decomposition can be done for the stress drops but for the sake of brevity we focus here on understanding the results shown in fig .",
    "[ anatdelu ] ; a similar analysis for the stress drops is implied .    .",
    "[ anatdelu ]    to understand what we see we will invoke the result of the previous work @xcite in which the distribution @xmath66 was measured over three orders of magnitude @xmath67 .",
    "these magnetization changes involved flips of magnetic domains of between @xmath68 particles .",
    "this probability distribution function ( pdf ) was found to be well fitted in this regime by a form @xmath69 where the exponential decay rate @xmath70 is analytically computed and the function @xmath71 is evaluated explicitly .    to make the connection to our present data we need to discuss the conditional distribution @xmath72 in terms of which the joint distribution @xmath73 can be written .",
    "we shall start with the general form for the energy drop @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the energy change ( both mechanical and magnetic ) associated with the slip of the @xmath36th spin in the flipping domain and @xmath76 is the number of flipping spins .",
    "we assume that each spin flip contributes to @xmath1 and thus @xmath77 with some unknown constant @xmath78 .",
    "thus @xmath0 is a sum of @xmath79 random variables , and using the central limit theorem we can assume a gaussian form for the conditional probability @xmath80 where both the average energy drop @xmath81 and the variance of the energy drops @xmath82 are functions of @xmath1 .",
    "we can now introduce two exponents @xmath83 and @xmath84 by @xmath85 one of the purposes of these notes is to estimate these exponents @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "now the total energy drop can be separated into its individual mechanical and magnetic contributions @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mechanical contribution to the energy drop , while the spin contribution can be separated into exchange @xmath88 , anisotropic @xmath89 and magnetic field @xmath90 contributions , and depending on the spin hamiltonian for the metallic glass ( which in our case is eq .",
    "( [ magu ] ) ) may lead to different exponents .",
    "let us therefore analyse the consequences of eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) carefully .",
    "first we note that @xmath91 and thus if a non zero @xmath92 exists we would find that @xmath93 or @xmath94 . on the other hand if there exists a contribution consisting of @xmath79 random variables with zero mean , then we might expect that contribution to scale like @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "the important point to note is that by measuring @xmath83 the physics underlying the spin flips can be found .    to estimate the variance of the fluctuations @xmath97 we write using eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) @xmath98.\\ ] ] thus while @xmath99 only depends on the additive contribution of @xmath79 random variables , the variance also depends on the correlation of different spins within the flipped domain . to see the consequence of these correlations ,",
    "let us consider first the case where the spins @xmath36 and @xmath100 are uncorrelated . in that case",
    "@xmath101 \\sim \\delta m$ ] or @xmath102 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the limit of strong correlations between spins in the flipped domain @xmath103 \\neq 0 $ ] and as a consequence @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "it is also possible that the clean scaling described above may not exist but rather several mechanisms are mixed .",
    "only simulations and data analysis can answer these questions .    at this point",
    "we want to use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in which an analytic form for the probability to see a magnetic jump of @xmath1 was proposed . to this aim",
    "we will attempt to find analytic approximants to the pdf @xmath106 in the form of four distinct contributions in agreement with fig .",
    "[ anatdelu ] : @xmath107 analyzing the data shown in fig .",
    "[ anatdelu ] we could approximate each of the four conditional pdfs in the form @xmath108 the best fits for the exponents @xmath83 and @xmath84 and for the constant @xmath15 are provided in table [ tab ] .",
    ".the best fit values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 for different energy terms .",
    "note that the exponent of 0.75 is not explained theoretically but the data for this particular contribution is small , close to the noise level .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the quality of the fits are demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ mean ] and [ variance ] .",
    "the exponents agree with our expectations of being 1/2 or 1 , except for the variance of the lennard - jones contribution in fig .",
    "[ variance ] .",
    "we note however that the amplitude of the lennard - jones @xmath0 is two orders of magnitude less than the other contributions and therefore we we are close to the noise level and can not trust this particular measurement .",
    "the smallness of this contribution arises from the fact that the straining here is done magnetically and the position of the particles do not change that much",
    ".    finally we write @xmath109 in the form @xmath110",
    "p(\\delta m)\\ .",
    "\\label{marginal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we use the analytic form of @xmath66 from ref . @xcite and compute the integral ( [ marginal ] ) numerically .",
    "the comparison of this reconstruction of the pdf of @xmath0 to its direct numerical calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ compare ] .",
    "1 cm    the conclusion of this exercise is that providing the anatomical details of the plastic events can help in understanding the statistics of energy or stress drops .",
    "we do not repeat in this paper the exercise for the stress drops since it follows verbatim the same steps .",
    "a similar richness in the anatomy of plastic events is found when the system is strained mechanically @xcite . even though we strain mechanically the coupling between positional and spin degrees of freedom results again in having a change in magnetization together with drops in energy and in stress . in figs .",
    "[ mechstress1 ] and [ mechstress2 ] we show a typical plot of energy , stress and magnetization vs external strain , for zero magnetic field and for a finite magnetic field .",
    "note that in the first case the total magnetization remains zero on the average , with the flips in magnetization @xmath1 being negative or positive with equal probability . for finite magnetic field magnetization",
    "is accumulated in the direction of the magnetic field at each plastic event .    as before with ramping the magnetic field",
    "we see that also with mechanical strain the plastic events couple mechanical and magnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "the drops in energy are occurring as a result of plastic instabilities at the same values of @xmath111 as the drops in stress and magnetization .",
    "the mechanism is the same , i.e. an eigenvalue of the hessian matrix hits zero punctuating the smooth curves of energy , stress or magnetization with sharp drops of irreversible events .    to understand the serrated response curve of the energy or the stress one needs again to search for the anatomy of the events , displaying carefully the contribution of each physical mechanism for either energy or stress drop .",
    "since we did not compute independently the barkhausen noise @xmath66 in this case we do not repeat the exercise for the case of mechanical straining .",
    "we stress however that any interested researcher must pay attention to the rich physics that is underlying the serrated `` noisy '' character of the data shown in figs .",
    "[ mechstress1 ] and [ mechstress2 ] .",
    "the main conclusion of this paper is that _ characterizing _ and _ understanding _ the statistics of serrated noise is not necessarily the same . even if we can plot the pdf s of energy drops or of magnetic jumps and measure the exponent that is associated with their log - log plot , it does not mean that we uncovered the intricate physics that underlies the phenomenon .",
    "we have seen here that even the simplest coupling between mechanical and magnetic degrees of freedom results in a multitude of contributions to the energy changes upon plastic events .",
    "each contribution comes with its own statistics , its own exponent and its own amplitude . of course , once we have the full information of all the contributions we can reconstruct the pdf of any wanted quantity , cf .",
    "[ compare ] .",
    "the full information is however not always available in experimental systems .",
    "thus great care is called for interpreting the observed statistics of serrated noises .",
    "in particular we should stress that changing conditions ( like zero or non - zero magnetic field in figs .",
    "[ mechstress1 ] and [ mechstress2 ] ) may change the statistics of the serrated noise .",
    "the amplitude of the various contributions to the observed serrated response can depend on the state of the system etc .",
    "thus universal statistics is expected to be the exception rather than the rule .",
    "rather , a careful analysis of the physics underlying the observed response is called for ."
