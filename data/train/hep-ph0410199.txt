    "heavy quark production in hard collisions of hadrons , leptons , and photons has been considered as a clean test of perturbative qcd ( for a recent review see , e.g. , ref @xcite ) .",

    "these studies are mainly motivated by the strong dependence of the cross section on the behavior of the gluon distribution , which determines the qcd dynamics at high energies .",

    "the results of those analysis show that future electron - proton ( nucleus ) colliders at hera and rhic @xcite , probably could determine whether parton distributions saturate and a stringent constraint to the behavior of the gluon distribution in the full kinematical range could be posed . along these lines , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have analyzed the possibility of using ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions ( upc s ) as a photonuclear collider and studied the heavy quark production assuming distinct formalisms for the qcd evolution .",

    "in particular , these authors have used the photon spectrum from ref .",
    "@xcite and a photon - proton cross section for quarkonium production obtained by fitting the h1 and zeus data . the main conclusion of that study is that the cross sections are large enough for this channel to be observed experimentally and that this reaction can be used to study the gluon distribution in protons at small values of the bjorken @xmath1 variable .",
    "this achievement motivates the analysis of other processes that are sensitive to the gluon distribution and have larger cross sections .    in this paper",
    ", we study the photoproduction of heavy quarks in proton - proton collisions considering distinct theoretical scenarios , which have been analyzed in detail in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "our main motivation comes from the fact that in this process the photon reaches energies higher than those currently accessible at desy - hera .",

    "moreover , based on the color dipole picture @xcite , we compute the total cross section for charm and bottom photoproduction within the iancu - itakura - munier ( iim ) model for the dipole cross section @xcite .",
    "these results will be used as input for our further calculations in proton - proton collisions . for comparison",

    "it is important to emphasize that the expression ( [ eq : photon_spectrum ] ) is based on a heuristic approximation , which leads to an overestimation of the cross section at high energies ( @xmath11 at @xmath12 tev ) in comparison with the more rigorous derivation of the photon spectrum for elastic scattering on protons derived in ref .",

    "however , its cross section is a factor about @xmath13 smaller than for the one - photon process .",
    "furthermore , differently from two - photon interactions , which leave both photon intact , photoproduction should only dissociate the proton target .",
    "then one way to select photoproduction events is to eliminate events where both protons breakup and requiring a single rapidity gap .    in what follows , we briefly present sound models for the heavy quark photoproduction at the photon level , @xmath14 , which enter as input in the calculations for proton - proton collisions in eq .",

    "a comparison on the order of magnitude of the cross sections for the distinct approaches is performed .",
    "moreover , we present our main conclusions .",
    "the photon - proton cross section can be calculated considering different theoretical scenarios @xcite . usually , one calculates it assuming the validity of the collinear factorization , where the cross sections involving incoming hadrons are given , at all orders , by the convolution of intrinsically non - perturbative , but universal , quantities - the parton densities , with perturbatively calculable hard matrix elements , which are process dependent . in this approach ,",
    "all partons involved are assumed to be on mass shell , carrying only longitudinal momenta , and their transverse momenta are neglected in the qcd matrix elements .",
    "the heavy quark cross section is given in terms of the convolution between the elementary cross section for the subprocess @xmath16 and the probability of finding a gluon inside the proton , namely the gluon distribution .",

    "it should be noticed that different choices for the factorization scale and quark mass produce distinct overall normalization to the total cross section at photon - nucleon interactions and that nlo corrections can be absorbed in these redefinitions of @xmath21 and @xmath28 . in the next section",
    "we discuss in more detail the dependence of our results in the parton distributions used as input in our calculations .",
    "on the other hand , in the large energy ( small-@xmath1 ) limit , the effects of the finite transverse momenta of the incoming partons become important , and the factorization must be generalized , implying that the cross sections are now @xmath0-factorized into an off - shell partonic cross section and a @xmath0-unintegrated parton density function @xmath29 , characterizing the @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite . the function @xmath30 is obtained as a solution of the evolution equations associated to the dynamics that governs the qcd at high energies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the latter can recover the usual parton distributions in the double leading logarithmic limit ( dll ) by its integration over the transverse momentum of the @xmath31 exchanged gluon .",
    "the gluon longitudinal momentum fraction is related to the c.m.s .",
    "energy , @xmath32 , in the heavy quark photoproduction case as @xmath33 .",
    "this assumption is a very good approximation , thought the scaling variable @xmath1 in fact depends on the kinematic variables of the incoming particles , namely on @xmath34 and parton momenta ( for details on these issues see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cross section for the heavy - quark photoproduction process is given by the convolution of the unintegrated gluon function with the off - shell matrix elements @xcite .",

    "( [ sigmakt ] ) for sake of generality .",
    "in performing a numerical analysis within the @xmath0-factorization approach ( hereafter labeled semihard ) , we use two distinct parameterizations for the unintegrated gluon distribution ( for details see ref .",
    "first , one considers the derivative of the collinear gluon distribution , quite successful in the proton case @xcite and investigated in the nuclear case in ref .",
    "it simply reads as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the gluon distribution , which was taken from the grv98(lo ) parton distribution @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of the function above is that it eventually produces negative values for the unintegrated gluon distribution at large @xmath1 .",
    "this has consequences in the description of the behavior near threshold , being more important for bottom production than for charm .",
    "this is due to the scaling variable to be proportional to the quark mass , @xmath44 , and in general the calculation slightly underestimates the cross section value at low energies .",
    "a more accurate calculation consists on multiplying the collinear gluon function above by the sudakov - like form factor @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "as the heavy quark production is characterized by a scale of order of the quark mass , the charm production , in particular , is considered a primary candidate for investigating the kinematic region of qcd on the boundary between perturbative and high density qcd ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated that the inclusive charm total cross section exhibits the property of geometric scaling @xcite , which is one of the main characteristics of the high density approaches .",
    "this fact motivates to estimate these features in the photoproduction case . in order to do so ,",

    "the lhc produces the greatest rates ( @xmath129 @xmath120s@xmath121 ) , giving for charm @xmath130 and for bottom @xmath131 events / year .",
    "notice the large rate for bottom at lhc .",
    "finally , lets discuss the experimental separation of this reaction channel . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , although the photoproduction cross section to be a small fraction of the hadronic cross section , the separation of this channel is feasible if we impose the presence of a rapidity gap in the final state .",
    "it occurs due to the proton which is the photon emitter remains intact in the process . similarly to the @xmath132 case",
    ", we expect that a cut in the transverse momentum of the pair could eliminate most part of the contribution associated to the hadroproduction of heavy quarks .",
    "moreover , in comparison with the hadroproduction of heavy quarks , the event multiplicity for photoproduction interactions is lower , which implies that it may be used as a separation factor between these processes . as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , one way to select photoproduction events is to eliminate events where both protons breakup .",
    "this should eliminate almost all of the hadroproduction events while retaining most of the photoproduction interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the rejection factor @xmath133 , which is the probability of finding a rapidity gap with width @xmath15 in a @xmath67 collision has been calculated . for photoproduction , the authors have obtained @xmath134 at rhic ( lhc ) , requiring a single rapidity gap and @xmath135 ( for details see section vi from ref .",
    "these estimates can be directly applied in our analysis .",
    "as photoproduction always leads to a rapidity gap , this requiriment should reject relatively few signal events , leading to a good signal to noise ratio for selecting these events .",
    "an important background which it should be analyzed is the diffractive heavy quark production in the single diffraction process @xcite .",
    "we postpone this study for a future publication .    in summary ,",
    "we have computed the cross sections for photoproduction of open heavy quarks in @xmath67 and @xmath107 collisions .",
    "this has been performed using well established qcd approaches , namely the collinear and semihard factorization formalisms as well as saturation models within the color dipole approach .",
    "for the first time , quantitative predictions for these approaches are presented .",
    "the obtained values are shown to be sizeable at the current accelerators energies ( rhic and tevatron ) and are increasingly larger at lhc .",
    "the feasibility of detection of these reactions is encouraging , since their experimental signature should be suitably clear .",
    "furthermore , they enable to constraint already in the current colliders the qcd dynamics since the main features from photon - proton collisions hold in proton - proton collisions .",
