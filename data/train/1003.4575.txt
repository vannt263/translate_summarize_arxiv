    "in quantum information technology , it is usual to use quantum channel for sending quantum state .",
    "since a quantum channel has noise , it is important to identify quantum channel . in this paper , we consider theoretical optimal performance of quantum channel estimation when we can apply the same unknown channel several times . in order to treat this problem ,",
    "we employ quantum state estimation theory . in our setting",
    ", we can optimize our input state and our measurement@xcite . as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] with @xmath1 , it is assumed to be possible to use entanglement with reference system in the measurement process when the channel @xmath2 with the unknown parameter @xmath3 is applied @xmath4 times .",
    "this setting is mathematically equivalent with the setting given in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] with @xmath1 , which has a single input state in the large input system and a single measurement in the large output system . in this paper , we consider quantum channel estimation with the formulation given by fig .",
    "[ f2 ] .    in the state estimation ,",
    "when the number @xmath4 of prepared states goes to infinity , the mean square error ( mse ) behaves as the order @xmath0 as in the estimation of probability distribution .",
    "however , in the estimation of quantum channel , two different analyses were reported concerning asymptotic behavior of mse . as the first case , in the estimations of depolarizing channels and pauli channels",
    ", the optimal mse behaves as @xmath0@xcite . as the second case , in the estimation of unitary , the optimal mse behaves as @xmath5@xcite . in the second case ,",
    "two different types of results were reported : one is based on the cramr - rao approach@xcite .",
    "the other is based on the mini - max approach@xcite .",
    "the cramr - rao approach is based on the notion of locally unbiased estimator , and allows one to give a simple lower bound ( the cramr - rao bound ) to the mean square error ( mse ) at a given point .",
    "the mini - max approach aims to minimize the maximum of the mse over all possible values of the parameter .",
    "the mini - max approach is more meaningful than the cramr - rao approach because the true value of the parameter is unknown .",
    "so , the cramr - rao bound is just a lower bound in general , while it can be asymptotically acheived in the case of quantum state estimation with the @xmath4 copies of the unknown state .",
    "however , the cramr - rao bound has been considered so many times in the literatures@xcite .",
    "the reason seems that computing the mini - max bound is a much harder problem .",
    "indeed , there are only very few examples of calculations of the mini - max bound , and most of them are in the compact group covariant setting , in which , as was shown by holevo @xcite , the mini - max bound coincides with the bayesian average of the mse over the normalized invariant measure .",
    "so , many researchers @xcite applied this approach to quantum channel estimation under the group covariance . as the most simple case for unitary estimation , phase estimation has been treated with the mini - max approach by several papers@xcite , and it has been shown that the minimum mse that behaves as @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cramr - rao approach suggests the noon state as the optimal input@xcite in phase estimation .",
    "the later estimation scheme was experimentally demonstrated in the case of @xmath1 @xciteand @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "also , another group @xcite experimentally demonstrated an estimation protocol concerning the group covariant approach proposed by @xcite . in phase estimation with group covariant framework",
    ", the asymptotic minimum mse behaves as @xmath5@xcite .",
    "when we focus on the difference @xmath7 between the true parameter @xmath3 and the estimate @xmath8 , the limiting distribution concerning the random variable @xmath9 can be obtained through fourier transform of a function with a finite domain @xcite .",
    "however , the cramr - rao bound is different from the asymptotic limit of the mini - max bound .",
    "so , these results seem to contradict with each other .",
    "no existing research compares both approaches in a unified viewpoint .",
    "the manuscript consists of two parts . in the first part ,",
    "we discuss the cramr - rao approach for channel estimation , and give a simple formula to compute a bound based on the right logarithmic derivative introduced by holevo@xcite .",
    "this formula is based on the choi - jamiolkowski representation matrix @xcite of the quantum channel , and holds under the condition that , at the given point , the support of the choi - jamiolkowski representation matrix contains the support of its derivative . under this condition",
    ", we prove the additivity of the rld fisher information for quantum channels .",
    "the second part is about the local asymptotic mini - max bound@xcite , in which the maximum of the mse is taken over an interval , the width of which is sent to zero after computing the asymptotic limits .",
    "the obtained results are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the local asymptotic mini - max bound is strictly larger than the cramr - rao bound in the case of phase estimation .",
    "( 2 ) both bounds coincide with each other when the asymptotic minimum mse behaves as @xmath0 .",
    "( 3 ) the local asymptotic mini - max bound is achievable ( proposition 3 ) , using a variation of the two - step strategy @xcite .",
    "that is , there is an optimal sequence of estimators that achieves the local asymptotic mini - max bound at any point . as consequence",
    ", the maximum of the local asymptotic mini - max bound is shown to be equal to the asymptotic limit of the mini - max bound .",
    "however , the cramr - rao bound has a different type of achievability .",
    "that is , there is an optimal sequence of estimators that achieves the cramr - rao at a given point .",
    "this characteristic is a curious quantum analogue of superefficiency in classical statistics . in estimation of probability distribution , if we assume a weaker condition for our estimator , there exists an estimator that surpasses the cramr - rao bound only in measure zero points .",
    "such an estimator is called a superefficient estimator@xcite . in the estimation of phase action",
    ", we point out that the cramr - rao bound can be attained only by a quantum channel version of a superefficient estimator that works at specific points .",
    "since the cramr - rao approach is based on the asymptotically locally unbiased condition , we can conclude that the asymptotically locally unbiased condition is too weak for deriving the local asymptotic mini - max bound , which can be attained in all points .",
    "indeed , a similar phenomenon happens in quantum state estimation when we use the large deviation criterion@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "some of obtained results are based on quantum state estimation with the cramr - rao approach .",
    "section [ s2 ] is devoted to a review of the cramr - rao approach in quantum state estimation . in this section , the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld )",
    "fisher information and the right logarithmic derivative ( rld ) fisher information are explained .",
    "however , the cramr - rao bound is obtained only by the locally unbiased condition .",
    "so , it is needed to discuss its relation with the estimator that works globally . in section [ s3 ] ,",
    "we treat sld fisher information and rld fisher information in the quantum channel estimation , and discuss the increasing order of sld fisher information . in section [ s31 ] , we give several examples where the maximum sld fisher information increases with @xmath10 . in section [ s4 ] , we compare the local asymptotic mini - max bound and the cramr - rao bound .",
    "we also show the global attainability of the local asymptotic mini - max bound in the channel estimation .",
    "it is also shown that the cramr - rao bound is closely related to a quantum channel version of superefficiency in the phase estimation .",
    "in quantum state estimation , we estimate the true state through the quantum measurement under the assumption that the true state of the given quantum system @xmath11 belongs to a certain parametric state family @xmath12 . in the following ,",
    "we consider the case when the number @xmath13 of parameters is one .",
    "usually , we assume that @xmath4 quantum systems are prepared in the state @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the total system is described by the tensor product space @xmath15 , and the state of the total system is given by @xmath16 .    in this case , when we choose a suitable measurement , the mse decreases in proportion to @xmath17 as in the estimation of probability distribution .",
    "so , we focus on the first order coefficient of the mse concerning @xmath18 . in the most general",
    "setting , any positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath19 on the total system @xmath15 is allowed as an estimator when it takes values in the parameter space @xmath20 .",
    "the mse is given as @xmath21 in the quantum case , there are several quantum extensions of fisher information when the state @xmath14 is differentiable at @xmath3 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the projection to the support of @xmath14 .",
    "the largest one is the right logarithmic derivative ( rld ) fisher information @xmath24 , and the smallest one is symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) fisher information @xmath25 . for these definitions ,",
    "we define the rld @xmath26 and the sld @xmath27 as the operators satisfying @xmath28 then , the rld and sld fisher informations are given by @xcite @xmath29 when the range of @xmath14 contains the range of @xmath30 , the rld fisher information has another expression : @xmath31 when the state family @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 , the condition ( [ 20 - 11-a ] ) does not hold , where @xmath34 is an hermitian matrix . in this case",
    ", the sld fisher information is calculated as follows@xcite .",
    "@xmath35    now , we introduce the unbiased condition by @xmath36 however , this condition is sometimes too restrictive in the asymptotic setting .",
    "so , we consider the taylor expansion at a point @xmath37 and focus on the first order .",
    "then , we obtain the locally unbiased condition at @xmath37 : @xmath38 under the locally unbiased condition at @xmath37 , an application of schwarz inequality similar to the classical case yields the quantum cramr - rao inequalities for both quantum fisher information .",
    "@xmath39 since @xmath24 is greater than @xmath25 , the inequality ( [ 12 - 1 - 1 ] ) is more informative than the inequality ( [ 12 - 1 - 2 ] ) . when the estimator @xmath19 is the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath40 , the equality in ( [ 12 - 1 - 1 ] ) holds , where @xmath41 is given as @xmath42",
    ". then , we obtain the following inequality @xmath43 this inequality seems to imply that @xmath24 is not as meaningful as @xmath25 in the one - parametric case . however , as will be explained latter , @xmath24 provides a meaningful bound for mse in the case of channel estimation .",
    "in fact , in the asymptotic setting , a suitable estimator usually satisfies the asymptotic locally unbiased condition : @xmath44 for all points @xmath37 . under the above condition , using ( [ 12 - 1 - 1 ] )",
    ", we obtain the inequality @xmath45 further , by using the two - step method , the bound @xmath46 can be universally attained for any true parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "so , defining the cramr - rao bound : @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48    on the other hand , its multi - parameter case is much complicated even in the asymptotic setting @xcite .",
    "so , this paper does not treat the multi - parameter case .",
    "in this section , we apply the cramr - rao approach to estimation of channel . in the quantum system , the channel is given by a trace preserving completely positive ( tp - cp ) map @xmath49 from the set of densities on the input system @xmath50 to the set of densities on the output system @xmath51 . by using @xmath52 linear maps @xmath53 from @xmath54 to @xmath55",
    ", any tp - cp map @xmath49 can be described by @xmath56 .",
    "hence , our task is to estimate the true tp - cp map under the assumption that the true tp - cp map belongs to a certain family of tp - cp maps @xmath57 .    in order to characterize a tp - cp map @xmath2",
    ", we formulate the notation concerning states on the tensor product system @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a system of the same dimensionality as @xmath11 and is called the reference system . using a linear map @xmath60 from @xmath59 to @xmath11 , we define an element @xmath61 of @xmath58 as follows .",
