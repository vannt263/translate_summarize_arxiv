    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in la(o@xmath2f@xmath3)feas @xcite the iron pnictides are currently one of the most important prototype systems for unconventional superconductivity .",
    "the mechanism of superconductivity is more than likely connected to magnetic fluctuations @xcite , which makes the magnetic behavior of the iron pnictides a crucial property @xcite . despite tremendous research over the last years the complex magnetism of these compounds is still non - trivial to explain and some problems remain unsolved .",
    "for example , a discrepancy is observed concerning the magnitude of the magnetic moment , depending on the chosen experimental method .",
    "neutron diffraction data predicts for the low - temperature phase of bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 a total magnetic moment of @xmath6 per fe from powder samples @xcite , while from  mssbauer spectroscopy @xcite a value between @xmath7 and @xmath8 was estimated .",
    "one should note that the magnetic moments in the iron pnictides are generally considered to behave nearly itinerant @xcite , although sometimes a localized picture might be more appropriate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations often overestimate the magnitude of the magnetic moments , ranging from approximately @xmath9 up to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thus , the magnetic moments are known to be highly sensitive to the system and computational parameters , which makes estimations difficult and leads sometimes to seemingly contradicting reports @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the importance of spin - orbit coupling for the iron pnictides was only recently stressed @xcite .",
    "nowadays , a lot of  mssbauer spectroscopy data are available for the bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 family with different types of substitution and doping @xcite .",
    "the previously mentioned discrepancy between neutron diffraction and  mssbauer spectroscopy is often ascribed to possible non - zero contributions of @xmath11-orbitals to the hyperfine field with an opposite sign to that of the fermi contact field @xcite .",
    "this would explain why the suggested hyperfine proportionality constant @xmath12 between the experimentally measured hyperfine field @xmath13 and the underlying magnetic moment @xmath5(fe ) has a non - linear behavior and is in particular not comparable to the corresponding value for bulk fe .",
    "this would imply that a more reliable estimation of magnetic moments based on  mssbauer spectroscopy lies not between @xmath7 and @xmath8 but has a higher value .",
    "although such aspects were already suggested as a most likely explanation for this discrepancy @xcite , a quantitative study of the theoretical hyperfine fields including relativistic contributions is still missing @xcite .",
    "to clarify this situation , we address in this paper the antiferromagnetic state of the undoped mother compound bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 together with a large variety of different types of substitution .",
    "these include electron doping in the case of ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath1as@xmath1 and ba(fe@xmath2ni@xmath3)@xmath1as@xmath1 , hole doping as in ( ba@xmath2k@xmath3)fe@xmath1as@xmath1 and also isovalently doped compounds like ba(fe@xmath2ru@xmath3)@xmath1as@xmath1 and bafe@xmath1(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath1 . to deal adequately with substitutional systems the fully relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker - green function ( kkr - gf ) approach is used , which was already shown to be an appropriate tool to investigate various properties of the iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "chemical disorder due to substitution is dealt by means of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , which effectively gives results comparable to the tedious average over many supercell configurations and is much more reliable than the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) @xcite .",
    "application of the cpa to the iron pnictides was already shown to be quite successful @xcite . using this approach",
    ", one can not only investigate the type - resolved evolution of magnetic moments with composition , but also the doping dependence of the hyperfine fields .",
    "furthermore , all contributions to the total hyperfine field @xmath0 can be separated , revealing the direct impact of orbital non-@xmath14-electron parts within the fully relativistic approach .",
    "all calculations have been performed self - consistently and fully relativistically within the four component dirac formalism , using the munich spr - kkr program package @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure is based on the orthorhombic , antiferromagnetic phase of bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 in its experimentally observed stripe spin state using a 4-fe unit cell .",
    "this implies antiferromagnetically ordered chains along the @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes and ferromagnetically ordered chains along the @xmath17 axis . the lattice parameters and as position @xmath18 where chosen according to experimental x - ray data @xcite . to account for the influence of different substitutions , a linear interpolation of the lattice parameters with respect to the concentration @xmath4",
    "was performed based on vegard s law @xcite .",
    "this interpolation was individually done for each type of substitution , based on available experimental data @xcite .",
    "more details on this procedure can be found in previous publications @xcite .",
    "the treatment of disorder introduced by substitution is dealt with by means of the cpa . for",
    "the angular momentum expansion of the kkr green function an upper limit @xmath19 was used , i.e. @xmath14 , @xmath20 , @xmath11 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals were included in the basis set , although contributions to the hyperfine field of fe from @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals are zero as one would expect .",
    "all dft calculations used the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) exchange - correlation potential with the parameterization as given by vosko , wilk and nusair @xcite .",
    "the calculation and decomposition of the hyperfine field @xmath0 is done in its fully relativistic form as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the calculated total magnetic moment of fe in the undoped mother compound bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 is @xmath5(fe ) = 0.73@xmath23 , as was already published in earlier work @xcite .",
    "this moment splits into a spin magnetic moment of @xmath24(fe ) = 0.70@xmath23 and an orbital magnetic moment of @xmath25(fe ) = 0.03@xmath23 .",
    "obviously , this is in good agreement with experimental neutron diffraction data of pure bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 being 0.87@xmath23 @xcite .    if the finite size of the atomic core is ignored , as usually done , the fully relativistic approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite splits @xmath0 into five contributions .",
    "there are two contributions due to the @xmath14-electrons that are conventionally ascribed to the fermi contact interaction .",
    "the larger part is the core polarization contribution @xmath26 that was demonstrated in numerous studies to be proportional to the local spin magnetic moment @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a @xmath14-electron contribution from the valence band @xmath27 that is due to the polarization and also dominantly due to the population mechanism @xcite . for systems with low symmetry",
    "there may be a spin dipolar contribution to @xmath0 for the non-@xmath14 electrons @xcite .",
    "apart from @xmath28-states , states with higher angular momentum like @xmath20- and @xmath11-states have zero probability density at the core and for that reason do not contribute to @xmath0 via the fermi contact term .",
    "if spin - orbit coupling is accounted for , as done here , there is an additional contribution due to the spin - orbit induced orbital magnetization @xcite . as the orbital contribution is in general dominating compared to the spin - dipolar one @xcite we use in the following the term orbital for the total field connected with non-@xmath14 electrons .",
    "thus , for a transition metal the remaining three contributions are the orbital field @xmath29 of the non-@xmath14 core states and the orbital fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the valence electrons with @xmath20- and @xmath11-character , respectively . with",
    "this one arrives for the hyperfine field @xmath0 at the following decomposition @xcite :    @xmath32     for ( a ) bcc fe and for ( b ) fe in antiferromagnetic bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 . for comparison",

    "[ fig_1 ] ( a ) shows for bcc fe numerical results for the various contributions to the hyperfine field . as it is well known , @xmath0 of bcc fe is dominated by its large core polarization contribution @xmath34 .",
    "this is enhanced by the field @xmath35 which is also negative .",
    "all other contributions are much smaller and positive . comparing the total calculated hyperfine field @xmath36 t with the corresponding experimental value @xmath37 t one finds the theoretical values too small by about 25% .",
    "this well known problem is primarily to be ascribed to shortcomings of lsda when dealing with the core polarization cased by the spin polarization of the valence electrons @xcite . to cure this problem",
    "it is common to enhance @xmath34 by about 25% @xcite .",
    "using this empirical approach one has for the enhanced hyperfine field @xmath33 the relation :    @xmath38    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ( a ) this leads to @xmath39 t for bcc fe , in good agreement with experiment .",

    "are obviously the same as for bcc fe as one would expect",
    ". however , the enhanced field @xmath42 t is in perfect agreement with experiment , confirming the transferability of the enhancement factor in eq .  .",
    "compared with bcc fe the various contributions to @xmath33 of fe in bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 show two major differences .",
    "first , the sign of the valence band @xmath14-electrons contribution @xmath27 is different and second , the spin - orbit induced contribution of @xmath11-electrons @xmath31 is considerably higher in the later case .",
    "both features lead to a very different relation between the enhanced hyperfine field @xmath33 and the local spin magnetic moment @xmath24 for the two systems . as @xmath33 of bcc fe is dominated by its enhanced core polarization contribution @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , which is proportional to @xmath24 , it seems justified to assume that the experimental field @xmath13 reflects in a one - to - one manner the local spin moment .",
    "for fe in bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 , on the other hand , we find @xmath45 , i.e. the total field @xmath33 can by no means be used to monitor the local spin magnetic moment of fe .",
    "having investigated the hyperfine field contributions of the undoped bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 including relativistic effects , an interesting issue is their variation under different types of substitution in the bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 family .",
    "two examples of electron doping were investigated , namely ba(fe@xmath2co@xmath3)@xmath1as@xmath1 ( co-122 ) and ba(fe@xmath2ni@xmath3)@xmath1as@xmath1 ( ni-122 ) , with the corresponding data shown in fig .",

    "a breakdown of the afm order is found from the calculations at @xmath55 , while a lower @xmath56 @xcite is observed in experiment .",

    "as the fe concentration does not change with substitution on the ba position , the average moment is therefore equal to the fe moment , leading in this case to @xmath57 .",
    "one can see that for k-122 the magnetic moments change only marginally over a wide concentration range @xmath4 and undergo a sharp drop for @xmath58 .",

    "[ fig_p ] ( a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig_ru ] ( a ) , respectively .",
    "the first point to note is , that the calculations do not lead to a critical concentration @xmath49 within the investigated regime of substitution , while on the experimental side one has @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "isovalent doping should in general shift the fermi level @xmath60 only marginally , leading to an unchanged nesting behavior .",
    "thus , magnetic ordering may be preserved as long as the substitutional limit @xmath61 has a finite magnetic moment . in the case of electron or hole doping of bafe@xmath1as@xmath1",
    "the breakdown of magnetic order at a critical concentration @xmath49 can be understood solely by the nesting condition when the fermi energy @xmath60 changes due to substitution .",
    "note that also k-122 shows a finite @xmath49 with good agreement to experiment , although the substitution happens not on the fe position but within the ba layer . on the other hand , isovalent substitution either within ( ru-122 ) or outside ( p-122 ) the fe layer can not explain the magnetic breakdown by the substitution alone .",
    "this indicates that other phenomena not accounted for within the cpa mean field approach influence the stability of the magnetic structure . in the literature e.g. magnetic dilution was discussed as the main driving force for the magnetic breakdown in ru-122 @xcite .",
    "although we find a decrease in the magnetic moments due to the decrease in the fe content , it seems not sufficient to cause a breakdown of the magnetic order without further reasons .",
    "spin fluctuations and incommensurate spin - density waves can have an impact on the stability of the antiferromagnetic order , but also the emergence of a competing superconducting state might play a role . in any case , it becomes obvious that the isovalently doped compounds of the bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 family are even more difficult to understand than the electron and hole doped variants .",
    "nevertheless , lsda - based calculations can reproduce the decrease of the average magnetic moment @xmath48 for ru-122 as well as for p-122 , although the details of this reduction in the magnetic moments are fundamentally different .    the magnetic moments and the hyperfine field contributions of fe in p-122 shown in fig .  [ fig_p ]",
    "behave in a similar way as those of k-122 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_k ] ) . in both cases",
    "the substitution takes place outside the fe layer ; i.e. although the fe concentration does not change the total fe moment @xmath62 does . the hyperfine field contributions of fe in p-122 vary again similar with composition as the magnetic moments do .",
    "of course , this has to be expected as the hyperfine field reflects the magnetization of the fe atoms , which are the only magnetic components of these systems .    for ru-122 the average moment @xmath48 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ru ] ( a ) decreases due to the increasing concentration of ru which has a small induced magnetic moment of around @xmath63 , independent on the concentration @xmath4 .",
    "however , the local fe spin magnetic moment @xmath64 and orbital @xmath65 magnetic moments surprisingly increase .",
    "this is a rather unexpected finding as it was not observed so far within theoretical investigations on the iron pnictides .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding relation to the directly measurable hyperfine field @xmath0 of fe is of interest as it provides an element specific probe of the magnetic properties . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_ru ] ( b ) , @xmath0 stays more or less constant over the whole investigated regime of substitution , although @xmath62 increases .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath64 and @xmath65 simultaneously increase leading to a subsequent increase of the absolute values of @xmath26 and @xmath31 . because the sign of both contributions is different",
    ", their changes essentially compensate each other .",
    "this does not contradict with experimental findings of reddy _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_ru ] ( b ) which show a more or less constant @xmath0 for ru concentrations @xmath66 .",
    "the rapid drop to lower @xmath0 values for ru-122 for @xmath67 is most likely connected to the proximity to the critical concentration @xmath49 , which could not be reproduced by our lsda - based calculations .    in conclusion , a quite unexpected and interesting variation of the magnetic moments and the hyperfine field with the concentration @xmath4 of the ru-122 compound was found which is consistent with experimental findings .",
    "this shows in particular , that ru-122 and p-122 differ more from each other with respect to their magnetic properties as one might expect for two isovalently doped pnictides .",
    "finally , the results can be used to clarify the relation between @xmath0 and the average magnetic moment @xmath48 .",
    "it is quite common to assume that the ratio @xmath68 or @xmath69 is constant and use this value in order to obtain the magnetic moments in related compounds from the fe hyperfine fields .",

    "@xmath76 @xcite . later on it was questioned whether these ratios @xmath77 are applicable to the iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is general work showing that a scaling of @xmath0 with the corresponding magnetic moment @xmath48 can not be assumed _ a priori _ because @xmath77 varies strongly for different materials @xcite .",

    "additionally , the assumption of a constant ratio @xmath77 for doped systems can be disproved , supporting other work @xcite which concludes that @xmath0 is indeed not proportional to @xmath48 for bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 based substitutional systems .",

    "independent on @xmath4 , we find the value of @xmath81 is nearly constant 10.6@xmath71 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with earlier work of lindgren and sjstrm where a value around 12.6@xmath71 was calculated @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath26 can obviously vary significantly from @xmath0 as was extensively shown in the literature .",
    "at least for the undoped bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 the average moment equals the total fe moment and is close to the spin magnetic moment of iron , @xmath82 .",
    "based on the calculations one gets for bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 a ratio @xmath83 or based on the enhanced hyperfine field @xmath33 a ratio @xmath84 .",
    "this is by a factor of 2  3 different from the ratio @xmath85 applied in previous publications @xcite .",
    "consequently , the magnetic moment of bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 based on the measured hyperfine field of 5.47 t should be not between @xmath7 and @xmath76 but rather in the range between @xmath86  @xmath87 , which is in better qualitative agreement with neutron diffraction , reporting @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that this is a qualitative estimation and it is clear from the literature @xcite and from our work that an estimation of @xmath48 based on @xmath0 should be avoided as far as possible .",
    "however , for the doped iron pnictides there is a significant difference between @xmath48 and @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath48 leads to an unpredictable , non - linear behavior of the ratio @xmath77 . to quantify our claim we plot the obtained values of @xmath69 and @xmath78 depending on the concentration @xmath4 for all investigated compounds in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . already the ratio @xmath79 , which is coupled to the spin magnetic moment of fe , depends strongly on the respective dopant and on the concentration @xmath4 .",
    "it becomes apparent that for such a behavior no reasonable relation between @xmath0 and @xmath64 is possible .",
    "this problem becomes even more obvious when considering @xmath77 . here , the ru-122 compound is interesting to mention because @xmath79 decreases with @xmath4 while @xmath77 increases with the concentration",
    "this is due to the fact that the fe moment in ru-122 increases while the average moment decreases ( see also fig .  [ fig_ru ] ) . thus , it can be crucially misleading to relate @xmath0 to the average magnetic moment @xmath48 in doped iron pnictides .",

    "<S> the hyperfine field @xmath0 and the magnetic properties of the bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 family are studied using the fully relativistic dirac formalism for different types of substitution . </S>",

    "<S> relativistic contributions were found to have a significantly stronger impact for the iron pnictides when compared to bulk fe . as an important finding , we demonstrate that it is not sensible to relate the hyperfine field @xmath0 to the average magnetic moment @xmath5 of the compound , as it was done in earlier literature . </S>"
