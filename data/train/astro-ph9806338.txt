    "magnetic fields from about 40 kg to 1 gg have been detected in about about 50 ( 2% ) of the 2100 known white dwarfs ( mccook &  sion 1998 ) .",
    "a list of all currently known magnetic white dwarfs is found in jordan ( 1997 ) .",
    "magnetic fields in the low field range ( @xmath0 mg ) in both hydrogen and helium rich magnetic white dwarfs can be detected by a relatively simple line pattern .",
    "hydrogen line components have been identified in many objects , but until recently , helium was detected unambiguously only in the magnetic white dwarf feige7 . using line data calculated by kemic ( 1974 ) , achilleos et al .",
    "( 1992 ) found that the spectrum could be well reproduced with a dipole of strength 35 mg displaced by 0.15 white dwarf radii from the stellar center .",
    "since the kemic data were calculated by regarding the magnetic field as a small perturbation to the coulomb interaction and are only valid up to about 20 mg , the kemic tables had to be extrapolated for the feige 7 analysis .",
    "the only other definite helium rich objects with fields of about 15 - 20 mg were discovered by reimers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the course of the hamburg eso survey .",
    "magnetic white dwarfs with field strengths @xmath1 mg containing hydrogen could be interpreted ever since the numerical calculations of energy level shifts and transition probabilities for bound - bound transitions by groups in tbingen and baton rouge ( forster et al .",
    "1984 ; rsner et al . 1984 ; henry and oconnell 1984 , 1985 ) . with the help of these data",
    "greenstein 1984 and greenstein et al .",
    "1985 could identify the hitherto unidentified features in  with stationary components of hydrogen in fields between about 150 and 500 mg .    since the magnetic field on the surface of a white dwarf is not homogeneous but e.g. better described by a magnetic dipole",
    ", the variation of the field strength from the pole to the equator ( a factor of two for a pure dipole field ) smears out most of the absorption lines at larger magnetic field strengths .",
    "however , a few of the line components become stationary , i.e. their wavelengths go through maxima or minima as functions of the magnetic field strength .",
    "these stationary components are visible in the spectra of magnetic white dwarfs despite a considerable variation of the field strengths",
    ".    about 80%  of all known white dwarfs have nearly pure hydrogen atmospheres ( spectral type da ) .",
    "however , since most of the remaining stars have helium rich atmospheres , we would also expect a significant number of magnetic white dwarfs to belong to the spectral type db in which lines are observed .",
    "therefore it could be expected that the few magnetic white dwarfs with unidentified spectral features , that can not be explained by the line data for hydrogen , are helium rich .",
    "the most famous example is gd229 , where swedlund et al .",
    "( 1974 ) , greenstein et al . ( 1974 ) , landstreet &  angel ( 1974 ) , liebert ( 1976 ) , greenstein &  boksenberg ( 1978 ) , and schmidt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found strong absorption features in the optical , infrared , and uv . angel ( 1979 ) already proposed that the absorption bands in this star are due to stationary components of hydrogen or helium .",
    "the basic difficulty in calculating energy levels and oscillator strengths for arbitrary field strengths lies in the fact that the coulomb potential has a spherical symmetry whereas the magnetic field induces a cylindrical symmetry .",
    "this prevents a separation of variables and together with the nonlinear character of the interactions makes even the numerical solution a difficult problem .",
    "in particular the intermediate regime ( @xmath2 ) , in which the majority of magnetic white dwarfs is found , is very complicated , since neither the magnetic nor the coulomb interaction dominates and we therefore encounter a so - called nonperturbative regime where none of the interaction terms can be treated by perturbation theory . in the case of the two electron system",
    "the situation is even more difficult , since the number of degrees of freedom is enhanced significantly and the electron - electron interaction introduces a third competitive force which makes a complex system with a rich variability of the spectrum with changing field strength .",
    "the particular challenge of a comparison of atomic data with observational ones lies in the fact that the energies of many excited states have to be known with a high relative accuracy ( usually @xmath3 ) and for a large number of field strengths in order to identify the stationary transitions .    until this year",
    "the status of electronic structure calculations on was such ( see braun et al.1998 , jones et al .",
    "1997 , ruder et al.1994 and references therein ) that a conclusive comparison was impossible and the occurence of in the atmosphere of gd229 had to be considered as a pure speculation as it was the case with respect to hydrogen in  until 1984 .",
    "therefore , several alternative explanations have been proposed .",
    "engelhardt &  bues ( 1995 ) have tried to explain the regular almost periodical structure of the gd229 spectrum by quasi - landau resonances of hydrogen in a magnetic field of 2.5gg .",
    "streicher et al .",
    "( 1987 ) speculated that two of the features could be due to intersections of hydrogen components in a field of about 25 - 60 mg .",
    "now , the calculations performed in heidelberg ( becken & schmelcher 1998 ) have closed that gap and for the first time precise data for a large number of energy states have become available . in this paper we will show that most of the absorption features in the optical and uv spectrum of gd229 can be identified as stationary line transitions of .",
    "the fixed - nucleus electronic hamiltonian of the helium atom in a strong magnetic field oriented along the @xmath4axis reads as follows @xmath5 where the sum includes the one particle terms in the order : field - free kinetic , orbital zeeman , diamagnetic , coulomb attraction and spin zeeman energies .",
    "the last term represents the repulsive electron - electron interaction .",
    "effects of the finite nuclear mass can easily be taken into account by using the corresponding scaling relations ( becken &  schmelcher 1998 ) . according to its symmetries the hamiltonian ( 1 ) possesses four independent conserved quantities : the total spin @xmath6 , its @xmath4component @xmath7 , the @xmath4component @xmath8 of the total spatial electronic angular momentum and the total spatial @xmath4parity @xmath9 ( parity is a combined symmetry of the previous ones ) which will be used to label the electronic states in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 specifies the degree of excitation within a given symmetry subspace .",
    "calculations are performed separately for each subspace with given quantum numbers . since the spin part of the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) are the usual spin singlet and triplet functions we address in the following exclusively the method of investigation for the spatial part of the wave functions .",
    "the key ingredient of our method for the ab initio calculation of the electronic structure of atoms in strong magnetic fields is a basis set of one particle functions which takes on the following appearance @xmath12 where @xmath13 with @xmath14 @xmath15 are nonlinear variational parameters ; @xmath16 is the @xmath17 parity of the one particle function .",
    "the basis set ( 2 ) has its precursor in a more general one ( schmelcher &  cederbaum 1988 ) which has successfully been applied for the investigation of the electronic structure of small molecules in strong magnetic fields ( kappes &  schmelcher 1996 ) .    due to the parameters @xmath15",
    "our basis set is extremely flexible which represents a major advantage in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "this allows us to accurately describe the changes in the electronic wave functions with changing field strengths .",
    "the values of the variational parameters @xmath18 are determined by a nonlinear optimization procedure which is performed for the spectrum of both hydrogen and he ii in a magnetic field .",
    "typically 150 one particle functions of type ( 2 ) are optimized in order to describe 15 hydrogenic states with a high accuracy .",
    "the optimization procedure has to be accomplished for each field strength separately ( see becken &  schmelcher 1998 and references therein ) .    the basic idea for solving the time - independent schrdinger equation belonging to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is then to construct out of the above optimized one particle functions a set of spatial two electron configurations @xmath19 being symmetric ( spin singlet ) or antisymmetric ( spin triplet ) with respect to the interchange of the electronic coordinates and respecting the above - discussed symmetries .",
    "we represent the exact wave functions @xmath20 by a linear combination of two electron configurations @xmath21 . by virtue of the variational principle",
    "we arrive at a generalized eigenvalue problem whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors are excellent approximations to the exact eigenenergies and wave functions .",
    "we remark that all matrix elements of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with respect to the basis afunctions ( 2 ) can be evaluated analytically resulting in a complicated series of higher transcendental functions whose numerically stable and efficient implementation required a number of different techniques .    the typical number of two - electron configurations @xmath19 , i.e. the dimension of the full hamiltonian matrix to be diagonalized , is of the order of 2000 - 4000 depending on the symmetries . on a powerful workstation 10 - 20",
    "h cpu are necessary to build up and diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix for each field strength and symmetry subspace .",
    "extensive calculations have been performed in the whole range @xmath22 , for 30 electronic states the energy could be determined to an accuracy of at least @xmath23 . for vanishing magnetic quantum number",
    "@xmath24 many excited singlet and triplet electronic states with positive and negative @xmath4parity have been determined .",
    "for nonzero angular momentum @xmath25 both singlet and triplet states have been studied for positive @xmath4parity .",
    "this gives us insight into an essential part of the spectrum of the he i atom with varying field strength and allows us in particular to decide whether he i can be present in the atmosphere of magnetic white dwarfs through an extraction of the stationary components of the transitions in the corresponding regime of field strengths .",
    "the strongest evidence that gd229 does not contain hydrogen came from a hst spectrum taken by schmidt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) : there is no evidence for components of  which do not vary very much over a very large range of magnetic field strengths .",
    "the @xmath26 transition has a maximum at 1341and should always be visible even at extremely high field if significant amount of hydrogen were present .    for the first time it is now possible to compare the spectral features of gd229 directly with the newly calculated wavelength tables for the line components of in a strong magnetic field ( becken & schmelcher 1998 ) .",
    "since oscillator strengths are not yet available we could not directly compare the spectrum with theoretical models ( see e.g. jordan 1992 ) .",
    "therefore we compared the positions of stationary line components with the observed absorption bands . in total about 150 line components",
    "have been calculated of which about 40 show stationary behaviour at different field strengths .",
    "if one looks at the helium line data up to @xmath27 ( corresponding to @xmath28gg ) it is rather striking to see that the majority ( 26 ) of all stationary components lies in the range @xmath29 ( see fig.[gdfig ] ; note that the wavelengths were determined by spline interpolation in a still relatively crude grid ) .",
    "so far only 10 grid points exist for the range of magnetic field strengths plotted in fig.[gdfig ] .    in practically all cases the minimum wavelength of the large number of features seen in the optical , ir , and uv spectrum of gd229",
    "can be attributed to the wavelength minima of the helium components ( listed in table[stationaries ] ) .",
    "this explains why the spectrum of gd229 has such an extremely large number of absorption features .    moreover , there are no clear contradictions between the predicted positions of absorptions and the observations",
    ". the only shortcoming of the current analysis is the fact that the strongest features at @xmath30  and at about @xmath31   can only be attributed to two line transitions ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "since the identification at other wavelengths is convincing we believe that additional stationary line components are hidden in the subspaces of bound - bound transitions that have not been calculated yet ( four subspaces @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and transitions with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath36 ) .    in principle",
    "the wavelength maxima ( also shown in the figure ) of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 transitions would fit well to the position of the two strongest absorption .",
    "however , the corresponding field strengths of about 50 mg would be much too low compared to the result found for the other features .",
    "such a large spread of magnetic field strengths is also rather improbable since the observed features are relatively sharp .",
    "an alternative interpretation would be that hydrogen is additionally present in the spectrum .",
    "the strong feature at 4124  in the spectrum of  ( which has a polar field strength of 320 mg , e.g. jordan 1992 ) caused by the hydrogen transition @xmath39 could also contribute to the strongest absorption feature in gd229 .",
    "however , in this case we would expect several other absorption troughs , e.g. at 5830  ( @xmath40 ) which are not present in gd229 .",
    "this is also compatible with the finding by schmidt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) that no lyman@xmath41 components are present in the uv spectrum .",
