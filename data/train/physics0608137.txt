    "conventional time series analysis is heavily dependent on the assumption of stationarity . but this assumption is unsatisfactory for modelling many real - life phenomena that exhibit seasonal behaviour .",
    "seasonal variations in the mean of time series data can be easily removed by a variety of methods , but when the variance varies with the season , the use of periodic time series models is suggested . in order to model periodicity in autocorrelations ,",
    "a class of periodic autoregressive moving average ( parma ) models was introduced .",
    "the parma@xmath2 system is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nonzero sequences periodic in @xmath7 with the same period @xmath8 while the innovations @xmath9 are independent gaussian random variables .",
    "for such parma models , the covariance function is a tool for describing the dependence structure of the time series and we can recall that the sequence given by ( [ parma ] ) is periodically correlated , more precisely the covariance function @xmath10 is @xmath11periodic in @xmath12 for every @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) . as the coefficients in ( [ parma ] ) are periodic , it is obvious that the class of parma models is an extension of the class of commonly used arma models . due to their interesting properties ,",
    "parma systems have received much attention in the literature and turned out to be an alternative to the conventional stationary time series as they allow for modelling many phenomena in various areas , e.g. , in hydrology ( @xcite ) , meteorology ( @xcite ) , economics ( @xcite ) and electrical engineering ( @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption of normality for the observations seems not to be reasonable in the number of applications , such as signal processing , telecommunications , finance , physics and chemistry , and heavy - tailed distributions seem to be more appropriate , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an important class of distributions in this context is the class of @xmath1-stable ( stable ) distributions because it is flexible for data modelling and includes the gaussian distribution as a special case .",
    "the importance of this class of distributions is strongly supported by the limit theorems which indicate that the stable distribution is the only possible limiting distribution for the normed sum of independent and identically distributed random variables .",
    "stable random variables have found many practical applications , for instance in finance ( @xcite ) , physics ( @xcite ) , electrical engineering ( @xcite ) .",
    "parma models with symmetric stable innovations combine the advantages of classical parma models and stable distributions  they offer an alternative for modelling periodic time series with heavy tails .",
    "however , in this case the covariance function is not defined and thus other measures of dependence have to be used .",
    "the most popular are the covariation and codifference presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a special case of stable parma models , i.e. parma(1,1 ) systems with symmetric @xmath1-stable innovations . in this case",
    "we rewrite the equation ( [ parma ] ) in a simple way , i.e. : @xmath14 where @xmath4 and the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nonzero periodic sequences with the same period @xmath8 while the innovations are independent symmetric @xmath1-stable ( s@xmath1s for short ) random variables given by the following characteristic function : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the scale parameter .",
    "let us define @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with the convention @xmath21 if @xmath22 .",
    "as the covariance function is not defined for stable random vectors , in section [ s_mofdep ] we present two other measures of dependence that can be used for symmetric stable time series  the covariation and the codiffrence . in section [ s_bsol ] we discuss the necessary conditions for existence of the bounded solution of parma(1,1 ) systems for @xmath23 and we note that results obtained in @xcite for parma systems with gaussian innovations can be extended to the case of stable innovations .",
    "the covariation and the codifference for parma(1,1 ) models with stable innovations are studied in section [ s_depstr ] and the asymptotic relation between these two measures of dependence for the considered models is examined there .",
    "we find it interesting to illustrate theoretical results and thus in section [ s_ex ] we give an example of parma(1,1 ) systems with s@xmath1s innovations and illustrate the periodicity of the considered measures of dependence and the asymptotic relation between them .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be jointly s@xmath1s and let @xmath26 be the spectral measure of the random vector @xmath27 ( see for instance @xcite ) . if @xmath28 then the covariance is not defined and thus other measures of dependence have to be used .",
    "the most popular measures are : the * covariation @xmath29 * of @xmath24 on @xmath25 defined in the following way : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the signed power @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 , and the * codifference @xmath34 * of @xmath24 on @xmath25 defined for @xmath35 : @xmath36    properties of the considered measures of dependence one can find in @xcite .",
    "let us only mention here that , in contrast to the codifference , the covariation is not symmetric in its arguments .",
    "moreover , when @xmath37 both measures reduce to the covariance , namely @xmath38 the covariation induces a norm on the linear space of jointly s@xmath1s random variables @xmath39 and this norm is equal to the scale parameter , see @xcite . hence throughout this paper the norm ( so - called covariation norm ) @xmath40 is defined by @xmath41 , for a s@xmath1s random variable @xmath24 and @xmath42 .",
    "the sequence @xmath43 , is bounded in a space @xmath39 with norm @xmath44 if @xmath45 . moreover , in this paper we write @xmath46 in @xmath39 if and only if @xmath47 .    if it is possible to transform the sequence @xmath48 to the moving average representation @xmath49 , where the innovations @xmath9 are independent s@xmath1s random variables with parameters @xmath18 and @xmath50 , then both the covariation and the codifference can be expressed in terms of the coefficients @xmath51 ( see @xcite ) : @xmath52 @xmath53",
    "in this section we consider parma(1,1 ) system given by ( [ parma12 ] ) with the s@xmath1s innovations for @xmath54 and we investigate when the bounded solution exists .",
    "let us assume that @xmath55 .",
    "in this case we show that the considered parma(1,1 ) system has a bounded solution given by the formula : @xmath56    provided that every @xmath57 can be represented as @xmath58 for some @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 now it sufficies to notice that by periodicity of coefficients and @xmath62 and that @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a real constant , @xmath66 .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 and hence @xmath48 given by ( [ forma1 ] ) is bounded .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that @xmath48 given by ( [ forma1 ] ) satisfies equation ( [ parma12 ] ) .    to prove the converse ,",
    "let us note that iterating the equation ( [ parma12 ] ) yields : @xmath68 for each @xmath4 and @xmath69 by periodicity of the coefficients we have @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath55 and @xmath48 is a bounded solution of ( [ parma12 ] ) then @xmath71 this means that the bounded solution of the system considered in this section is given by @xmath72    in a similar manner , it can be shown , that if @xmath73 , then the bounded solution of the system under study is given by @xmath74    it is worth pointing out here that the solution for the parma(1,1 ) system with s@xmath1s innovations takes the same form of the moving average as in the case of gaussian innovations obtained in @xcite and it reduces to well - known formula for arma models in case of constant coefficients .",
    "let us consider parma(1,1 ) system given by ( [ parma12 ] ) with s@xmath1s innovations for @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , we will restrict our attention to the case @xmath55 because this case is more important for applications  as shown in section [ s_bsol ] , the considered system has a bounded solution @xmath48 in the linear space of jointly s@xmath1s random variables with norm @xmath44 given by the causal moving average representation ( [ forma1 ] ) .    in order to investigate the dependence structure of stable parma(1,1 ) models we will first rewrite @xmath75 as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and then using results presented in section [ s_mofdep ] we will find formulas for the covariation and the codifference .",
    "we will also study periodicity of these measures and their asymptotic relation .    *",
    "the covariation . *",
    "if @xmath78 , then for @xmath50 we have @xmath79 it is easy to notice that @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath82 we obtain @xmath83 as every @xmath57 can be represented as @xmath58 for some @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we have @xmath84 now it suffices to notice that by periodicity of coefficients and @xmath85 and that @xmath63 .",
    "thus @xmath86 if @xmath87 , then the covariation is given by @xmath88 in this case @xmath89 which results in formula @xmath90 the simple calculation similar like in the previous case leads us to the result @xmath91 as the sequences @xmath16 and @xmath15 are periodic in @xmath7 with period @xmath8 , the covariation is periodic in @xmath7 and @xmath92 with the same period , indeed @xmath93 .    * the codifference . * for @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath78 we have to calculate @xmath94 observe that there are @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( as @xmath97 ) in each part of the above formula .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath98 that can be transformed to @xmath99 and now it is sufficient to notice that the sum @xmath100 has been already calculated for the covariation .",
    "so we obtain @xmath101 it is not necessary to calculate the codifference for @xmath87 as this measure is symmetric in its arguments , i.e. for every @xmath102 we have @xmath103 . by the assumption , the coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath15 are periodic in @xmath7 with period @xmath8 .",
    "thus it is not difficult to notice that @xmath104 , which means that the codifference is periodic in @xmath7 and @xmath92 with the period @xmath8 . *",
    "asymptotic relation between cv and cd .",
    "* using formulas ( [ cv1 ] ) , ( [ cv2 ] ) and ( [ cd1 ] ) and two simple facts that hold for @xmath54 , @xmath105 and any real constant @xmath106 : @xmath107 @xmath108 it can be proved that for the considered parma(1,1 ) systems with s@xmath1s innovations the following relations hold for each @xmath4 and @xmath54 : @xmath109 @xmath110    the interesting point is that , because of asymmetry of the covariance , we obtained quite different asymptotic results . moreover , ( [ glowne11 ] )",
    "extends the results obtained in @xcite for arma models and it reduces to ( [ covcvcd ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "in order to illustrate our theoretical results let us consider parma(1,1 ) model with s@xmath1s innovations with @xmath111 , where the coefficients are given by @xmath112        it is clear that the coefficients are periodic with @xmath113 and in this case @xmath114 .",
    "therefore we are allowed to use formulas obtained in sections [ s_bsol ] and [ s_depstr ] .",
    "we first want to demonstrate how the parameter @xmath1 influences the behaviour of the time series , so we plot 1000 realizations of the considered model for @xmath37 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , see figure [ fig_real ] .",
    "it is easy to notice that the smaller @xmath1 we take , the greater values of the time series can appear ( property of heavy - tailed distributions ) .",
    "next , we want to show the dependence structure of the considered model , especially periodicity of measures of dependence . in order to do this",
    "we plot the codifference @xmath117 and the covariation @xmath118 for @xmath115 and @xmath116 in case of @xmath119 , see figure [ fig_miary ] .",
    "although the behaviour of the measures of dependence depends on the parameter @xmath1 , one can observe that both measures are periodic with the same period @xmath113 .",
    "finally , let us illustrate the asymptotic relation between the covariation and the codifference that is studied in section [ s_depstr ] .",
    "figure [ fig_asym ] contains plots of the functions @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath115 and @xmath116 . according to the theoretical results , the first two quotients tend to 1 and the next two tend to 0 as @xmath13 increases .",
