    "a pair of compact objects ( black holes or neutron stars ) in binary orbit about one another is stable in newtonian gravity . in general relativity , however , the system will emit gravitational radiation , causing the bodies to spiral in towards one another . the early stages of this process , where the gravitational interaction is weak everywhere , can be treated with the post - newtonian approximation , while the final merger of the objects can be modeled using supercomputers . in order to determine the waveform in an intermediate phase , where the rate of energy loss due to gravitational radiation is low , but other strong - field effects may be important , and also to provide accurate initial data for supercomputer calculations , it is useful to employ an approximation scheme based on the fact that the orbits are decaying only slowly . over some range of time , the physical spacetime should be approximated by a spacetime in which the orbits do not decay @xcite . for elliptical orbits this spacetime will be periodic , with the period equal to the orbital period of the objects . if the orbits are circular , this discrete symmetry becomes a continuous symmetry and the spacetime is stationary .",
    "finding this spacetime is thus an essentially three - dimensional problem , rather than a four - dimensional one .",
    "solving this three - dimensional problem is still numerically intensive , however , so in order to examine the consequences of this approximation scheme in a computationally simpler environment , we consider initially a toy model which exhibits an additional translational symmetry perpendicular to the orbital plane .",
    "the desired spacetime then has two killing vectors , and we have only a two - dimensional problem .",
    "this , the first in a series of papers on this project , is concerned with formulating the einstein equations in the presence of these two killing symmetries .",
    "paper ii @xcite examines , in the simpler model of a non - linear scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions , the details of the radiation - balanced boundary conditions which must be imposed `` at infinity '' to specify a stationary , energy - conserving solution to a radiative system .",
    "subsequent papers will apply this method of radiation balance to the gravitational fields of co - orbiting lines of mass and ultimately to localized sources , thus removing one at a time the simplifications of scalar field theory and translational invariance .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a toy model for binary inspiral that has such a two - dimensional symmetry group .",
    "the model problem consists of two infinitely long lines of mass ( e.g. , cosmic strings ) orbiting one another at fixed angular velocity . using a formalism introduced by geroch @xcite",
    ", we describe the geometry of the toy model spacetime in terms of a set of tensor fields on the two - dimensional manifold of killing vector orbits .",
    "we also derive explicit expressions for the einstein equations for the spacetime in terms of the degrees of freedom which remain after a particular choice of gauge .",
    "future work will solve these equations numerically for a reasonable set of boundary conditions .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows :    in sec .",
    "[ sec : problem ] , we begin our analysis by describing minkowski spacetime in a `` co - rotating '' coordinate system corresponding to two co - orbiting cosmic strings .",
    "we show that , even for this simple spacetime , the two killing vector fields ( kvfs ) defined by the strings do _ not _ select a preferred coordinate system consisting of two killing coordinates and two coordinates on an orthogonal subspace .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2kvf ] , we describe a formalism which can be used to simplify the discussion of spacetimes with two kvfs , even in the absence of a system of mutually orthogonal killing and non - killing coordinates .",
    "the formalism was initially developed by geroch @xcite , and we generalize his derivation of the vacuum einstein equations by deriving expressions for different projections of the einstein tensor .",
    "we also show how the various components of the einstein tensor are related by the contracted bianchi identities , and we show explicitly how to recover the four - geometry from geroch s more specialized objects .",
    "the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec:2kvf ] applies to _ any _ spacetime with two commuting killing vector fields ; it is _ not _ specialized to the co - rotating cosmic string spacetime considered in the rest of the paper .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : fix ] , we return our focus to the co - rotating cosmic string spacetime by discussing the gauge choices available within geroch s formalism .",
    "we describe some desirable gauge - fixings , and we enumerate the independent degrees of freedom which remain .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : pdes ] , we derive explicit expressions for the components of the einstein tensor in terms of the independent functions needed to describe the geometry .",
    "these equations , when supplemented by a description of the stress - energy of the cosmic strings and a set of boundary conditions @xcite , set the stage for a numerical solution of the einstein equations , which will be performed in the future .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we summarize the results of our paper and discuss how they will be used as the starting point for future work .    the first two appendices contain proofs of formulas used in sec .",
    "[ sec:2kvf ] : appendix  [ app : grad_k ] contains a proof of the expression ( [ e : grad_k ] ) for the covariant derivative of a killing vector field , and appendix  [ app : ricci ] contains a detailed derivation of the projected components of the ricci tensor , which we state in sec .  [ sec:2kvf ] .",
    "the third and fourth appendices consider ancillary subjects : appendix  [ app : coord ] describes how to obtain from the quantities defined by geroch the components of the four - metric in a coordinate basis rather than the non - coordinate one used in the text , and recovers the normal form given by petrov @xcite as a consequence of a particular coordinate choice .",
    "finally , appendix  [ app : geroch ] demonstrates the correspondence between the formulas contained in sec .",
    "[ sec:2kvf ] and those given by geroch in appendix  a of @xcite , the latter being a special case of the former .",
    "note : throughout this paper , we will follow the sign conventions of @xcite .",

    "the killing vectors are labeled by upper case latin letters @xmath3  , and the two - dimensional coordinate indices on the space of orbits of the killing vectors by lower case latin letters @xmath4  from the middle of the alphabet .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we wish to describe a spacetime which has two infinitely long cosmic strings orbiting one another at a fixed angular velocity @xmath5 . in a numerical determination of the spacetime geometry ,",
    "one seeks to fix the coordinate ( i.e. , gauge ) information completely , and thus calculate the minimum number of quantities necessary to define the geometry .",
    "it is desirable , of course , to choose a gauge which takes advantage of the symmetries of the problem . in this case , those symmetries are described by two kvfs .",
    "one of these , @xmath6 , corresponds to the translational invariance along the strings , while the other , @xmath7 , tells us that the spacetime is unchanged if we move forward in time while rotating about the axis by a proportional amount .",
    "the desired coordinate system would seem to consist of killing coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 , supplemented by coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 on an orthogonal subspace .",
    "( indeed , this is what is done @xcite in the case of stationary , axisymmetric spacetimes , which also admit two commuting killing vectors . )",
    "however , in the case at hand , the `` co - rotational '' killing vector @xmath7 is not surface - forming , and _ there is no subspace orthogonal to the killing vectors_. this is illustrated by describing minkowski spacetime in coordinates tailored to the symmetries exhibited by co - rotating cosmic strings .",
    "the minkowski metric @xmath12 , written in standard cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath13 , gives rise to the line element @xmath14 we can work in a reference frame which rotates with a fixed angular velocity @xmath5 by defining a `` co - rotating '' angle @xmath15 and transforming to coordinates @xmath16 . in these coordinates the line element takes the form @xmath17 which can be expanded to yield @xmath18 if we limit consideration of the symmetries of the spacetime to those described by the two commuting kvfs    @xmath19    we see that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding killing coordinates for the metric written in the form ( [ rotline ] ) .",

    "( [ rotline ] ) means that the coordinate pairs @xmath23 and @xmath24 have not split the spacetime into orthogonal subspaces .",
    "and @xmath25 _ does _ split the spacetime into orthogonal subspaces .",
    "however , although @xmath26 is a killing coordinate in minkowski space , it will not be in the cosmic string spacetime with which we are concerned , and so such a coordinate splitting is not of interest to us .",
    "] in fact it is _ impossible _ to base such a split on these two killing vectors , for while @xmath6 is clearly surface forming , @xmath7 is not , as calculation of @xmath27 clearly shows . and @xmath28 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the duality operator ( see , e.g. , p.  88 of @xcite ) . ] the other killing vector might save us , if eq .",

    "in this section , we describe a general formalism ( originally developed by geroch @xcite ) that can be used to simplify the discussion of spacetimes admitting two commuting kvfs , even in the absence of of a system of mutually orthogonal killing and non - killing coordinates .",
    "we present a new derivation of the projected form of the einstein equations ( and the bianchi identities which relate various components of the einstein tensor ) , and we show how to reconstruct the original four - geometry , given only the values of certain tensor fields on the two - dimensional space of killing vector orbits .",
    "the analysis that we give in this section is completely general . in particular",
    ", we do not restrict attention to the case of the two co - rotating cosmic string spacetime , which we consider in the rest of the paper .",

    "since we will not assume that the kvfs are orthogonally transitive ( i.e. , that the two - dimensional subspaces orthogonal to @xmath7 and @xmath6 are integrable ) , one or both of the quantities @xmath68 can be non - zero somewhere in @xmath60 .    given @xmath12 and @xmath61 , we can construct the symmetric matrix of inner products @xmath69 if the determinant @xmath70 is non - zero , then we can further define a projection tensor @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the inverse matrix to @xmath39 .",
