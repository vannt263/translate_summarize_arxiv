    "in this section we formulate a model of culture dispersal and competition .",
    "we are interested in a description regarding a historical context , in which two populations using different languages ( or with different cultural traits ) 1 and 2 disperse across a region .",
    "simultaneously , the competition between the languages takes place and possibly the populations also grow . as a starting model",
    "we assume the as language competition model . a diffusion term , describing population dispersal , and an advection term , taking into account geographical inhomogeneities ,",
    "are then added ; population growth is taken into account through a logistic term .",
    "the as model was first introduced in ref .",

    "speakers of population 1 and 2 behave symmetrically to each other as prey and predator at the same time  @xcite . while this situation is not usual in biology , it can be justified for the interaction between two cultural traits  @xcite .",
    "the analysis shows that the as model has one unstable and two stable equilibrium points .",
    "the latter ones correspond to one of the languages surviving and the other one disappearing . which final state will be reached depends on the initial populations @xmath16 , the status parameters @xmath6 , as well as on the value of @xmath10 .",
    "the critical values of parameters defining the unstable equilibrium point can be obtained from eqs .",

    "while the underlying mechanisms determining the influence of such geographical factors are in general complex , in a first approximation their overall effect can be described statistically .",
    "in fact , dispersal of human populations in an geographical environment recalls the diffusion of brownian particles modulated by an external field or an inhomogeneous substrate .",

    "the survival of both languages observed in the example discussed above can be ascribed to the interplay between historical conditions ( initial localization of the two speakers communities on opposite sides of the barrier ) and geographical constraints ( presence of the barrier ) . in fig .",
