    "contemporary experimental facilities employ large momentum transfer reactions to probe the structure of hadrons and thereby attempt to elucidate the role played by quarks and gluons in building them . since the proton is a readily accessible target its properties have been studied most extensively  @xcite .",
    "hence an understanding of a large fraction of the available data requires a poincar covariant theoretical description of the nucleon .    at its simplest",
    "the nucleon is a nonperturbative three - body bound - state problem , an exact solution of which is difficult to obtain even if the interactions are known .",
    "hitherto , therefore , phenomenological mean - field models have been widely employed to describe nucleon structure ; e.g. , soliton models  @xcite and constituent - quark models  @xcite .",
    "these models are most naturally applied to processes involving small momentum transfer ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the nucleon mass ) and , as commonly formulated , their applicability may be extended to processes involving larger momentum transfer by working in the breit frame  @xcite . alternatively , one could define an equivalent , galilean invariant hamiltonian and reinterpret that as the poincar invariant mass operator for a quantum mechanical theory  @xcite but this path is less well travelled .",
    "another approach is to describe the nucleon via a poincar covariant faddeev equation .",
    "that , too , requires an assumption about the interaction between quarks .",
    "an analysis  @xcite of the global colour model  @xcite suggests that the nucleon can be viewed as a quark - diquark composite .",
    "pursuing that picture yields  @xcite a faddeev equation , in which two quarks are always correlated as a colour - antitriplet diquark quasiparticle ( because ladder - like gluon exchange is attractive in the @xmath5 quark - quark scattering channel ) and binding in the nucleon is effected by the iterated exchange of roles between the dormant and diquark - participant quarks .",
    "a first numerical study of this faddeev equation for the nucleon was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , and following that there have been numerous more extensive analyses ; e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite employs confined quarks , and confined , pointlike - scalar and -axial - vector diquark correlations , to obtain a spectrum of octet and decuplet baryons in which the rms - deviation between the calculated mass and experiment is only @xmath6% .",
    "the model also reproduces nucleon form factors over a large range of momentum transfer  @xcite , and its descriptive success in that application is typical of such poincar covariant treatments ; e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "however , these successes might themselves indicate a flaw in the application of the faddeev equation to the nucleon .",
    "for example , in the context of spectroscopy , studies using the cloudy bag model ( cbm )   @xcite indicate that the dressed - nucleon s mass receives a negative contribution of as much as @xmath7-@xmath8mev from pion self - energy corrections ; i.e. , @xmath9 to @xmath10mev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a perturbative study , using the faddeev equation , of the mass shift induced by pointlike-@xmath2 exchange between the quark and diquark constituents of the nucleon obtains @xmath11 to @xmath12mev  @xcite .",
    "unameliorated these mutually consistent results would much diminish the value of the @xmath6% spectroscopic accuracy obtained using only quark and diquark degrees of freedom .",
    "it is thus apparent that the size and qualitative impact of the pionic contribution to the nucleon s mass may provide material constraints on the development of a realistic quark - diquark picture of the nucleon , and its interpretation and application .",
    "our article is an exploration of this possibility and we aim to clarify the model dependent aspects .",
    "we emphasise , in addition , that chiral corrections to baryon magnetic moments and charge radii are also important  @xcite , and their model - independent features furnish additional constraints on any quark model , including those based on the faddeev equation , thereby guiding their improvement .",
    "we note , too , that lattice - qcd studies of baryon masses , especially as a function of the current - quark mass  @xcite , also provide information that can guide these considerations ; e.g. , a recent lattice - qcd exploration of the connection between @xmath13 and @xmath0 masses is consistent with the pion self - energies described above  @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : fad ] we recapitulate on the faddeev equation and its solution for the @xmath13 and @xmath0 in a simple model .",
    "section  [ sec : piloop ] discusses model - independent aspects of the dyson - schwinger equation ( dse )  @xcite that describes the pionic correction to the @xmath13 s self - energy and therein we also present exemplary estimates for the magnitude of the effect .",
    "section  [ sec : epil ] is an epilogue .",
    "the properties of light pseudoscalar and vector mesons are well described by a renormalisation - group - improved rainbow - ladder truncation of qcd s dses  @xcite , and the study of baryons via the solution of a poincar covariant faddeev equation is a desirable extension of the approach .",
    "the derivation of a faddeev equation for the bound state contribution to the three quark scattering kernel is possible because the same kernel that describes mesons so well is also strongly attractive for quark - quark scattering in the colour - antitriplet channel ( see sec .  [",
    "subsubsec : gamma ] ) . and",
    "it is a simple consequence of the clebsch - gordon series for quarks in the fundamental representation of @xmath14 : @xmath15 that any two quarks in a colour singlet bound state must constitute a relative colour antitriplet .",
    "this supports a truncation of the three - body problem wherein the interactions between two selected quarks are added to yield a quark - quark scattering matrix , which is then approximated as a sum over all possible diquark pseudoparticle terms : dirac - scalar @xmath16 -pseudovector @xmath17 $ ]  essentially a separable two - body interaction  @xcite .",
    "a faddeev equation follows , which describes the three - body bound - state as a composite of a dressed - quark and nonpointlike diquark with an iterated exchange of roles between the dormant and diquark - participant quarks .",
    "the bound - state is represented by a faddeev amplitude : @xmath18 where the subscript identifies the dormant quark and , e.g. , @xmath19 are obtained from @xmath20 by a correlated , cyclic permutation of all the quark labels .    the faddeev equation is simplified further by retaining only the lightest diquark correlations in the representation of the quark - quark scattering matrix . a simple , goldstone - theorem - preserving , rainbow - ladder dse - model  @xcite yields the following diquark pseudoparticle masses ( isospin symmetry is assumed ) : @xmath21 the mass ordering is characteristic and model - independent ( cf .   refs .",

    "( [ edse ] ) .",
    "studies using the cbm indicate that a quantitative description of @xmath1 vertex renormalisation requires that the @xmath0 be treated on an equal footing with the nucleon and that this is crucial to obtaining a convergent expansion  @xcite .",
    "indeed , one finds , as here , that the @xmath2-loop acts to suppress the nucleon s wave - function renormalisation ; i.e. , it forces @xmath386 , but in the cbm this effect is compensated by an almost matching suppression of @xmath387 so that the bare and renormalised @xmath1 couplings are little different .",
    "a self - consistent , covariant treatment of the coupled composite-@xmath13-@xmath0 system is more than we are able to describe herein .",
    "however , the cbm studies suggest that a reliable estimate of the effect of including the @xmath0 can be obtained simply by solving an analogue of eq .",
    "( [ edse ] ) with @xmath388 for a renormalised model .",
    "we have done this and thereby arrive at a robust result : the @xmath1-loop reduces the nucleon s mass by @xmath389-@xmath390%  @xcite .",
    "extant calculations ; e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , show that the contribution from the analogous @xmath391-loop is of the same sign and no greater in magnitude so that the likely total reduction is @xmath392-@xmath393% . based on these same calculations",
    "we anticipate that the @xmath0 mass is also reduced by @xmath2 loops but by a smaller amount ( @xmath394-@xmath395mev less ) .",
    "how does that affect the quark - diquark picture of baryons ? to address this issue",
    "we again solved the faddeev equations , this time requiring that the quark - diquark component yield higher masses for the @xmath13 and @xmath0 : @xmath396gev , @xmath397gev .",
    "the results , presented in the third and fourth rows of table  [ tablemass ] , establish that the effects are not large . in this case omitting the axial - vector diquark yields @xmath398gev , which signals a @xmath399% increase in the importance of the scalar - diquark component of the nucleon .",
    "( it is an _ increase _ because this component now requires less correction .",
    "note , too , that the scalar diquark s charge radius , @xmath400fm , is @xmath401% larger . )",
    "it also announces a reduction in the role played by axial - vector diquark correlations in the nucleon , since now restoring them only reduces the nucleon s core mass by @xmath402% , with @xmath2 self - energy corrections providing the remaining @xmath403% .",
    "it is thus apparent that requiring an exact fit to the @xmath13 and @xmath0 masses using only quark and diquark degrees of freedom leads to an overestimate of the role played by axial - vector diquark correlations : it forces the @xmath157 diquark to mimic , in part , the effect of pions since they both act to reduce the mass cf .",
    "that of a quark@xmath16scalar - diquark baryon .",
    "we showed that an internally consistent description of the @xmath13 and @xmath0 masses is easily obtained using a poincar covariant faddeev equation that represents baryons as composites of a confined - quark and -diquark .",
    "we term this the `` core mass '' of the baryons .",
    "they are weakly bound in the limited sense that the sum of the masses of their primary constituents is little greater than their core mass .",
    "the on - shell @xmath179 and @xmath180 couplings are large and hence it is conceivable that @xmath1 and @xmath391 self - energy corrections to the nucleon s mass may be significant .",
    "we therefore studied the effects of the @xmath1-loop on the nucleon s core mass and found that , in well - constrained models , this loop reduces that mass by @xmath404% . including the @xmath405 self - energy contribution , the total reduction is likely to be between @xmath406 and @xmath407% . while this is a material effect it does not undermine the qualitative picture of baryons suggested by the faddeev equation ; namely , that baryons are primarily quark - diquark composites .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a converged nonperturbative calculation of the @xmath2-induced self - energy requires only three `` pions in the air , '' but to be certain we re - solved the faddeev equation aiming at nucleon and @xmath0 masses corrected for the @xmath2 self - energy contribution , and found little change in the character of the solution .",
    "the one notable effect was a material reduction in the nucleon s axial - vector diquark component .",
    "this is easily understood : ignoring @xmath2-loops forces the axial - vector diquarks to mimic their effect . that surrogacy can not be completely effective and",
    "may have led to quantitative errors , and errors of interpretation , in contemporary quark - diquark based calculations of quantities such as the neutron s charge form factor and the ratio @xmath408 .",
    "our results should serve as a signal of this possibility and stimulate increased caution and an objective reanalysis .",
    "our exploration of the role of @xmath2-loops was pedagogical .",
    "we made clear that the leading nonanalytic contribution to the nucleon s mass arises from that part of the loop integral which corresponds to a positive - energy nucleon ; i.e. , whether the @xmath179 coupling is pseudoscalar or pseudovector , the @xmath409-diagrams do not affect the leading nonanalytic behaviour .",
    "furthermore , we showed explicitly that the one - loop mass shift calculated with a pseudoscalar coupling is _",
    "precisely _ the same as that obtained with a pseudovector coupling , so long as , and only if , no diagrams are overlooked in the pseudoscalar calculation .",
    "we illustrated that , using any translationally invariant regularisation procedure which preserves information about the pion s finite size , the tadpole ( hartree ) diagram generated by a pseudoscalar coupling can not be neglected because it balances the very large contribution from the pseudoscalar @xmath409-diagram .",
    "this result should not be overlooked in the phenomenological application of model field theories founded on hadronic degrees of freedom .",

    "<S> induced self - energy corrections to the nucleon s mass are analysed and shown to be independent of whether a pseudoscalar or pseudovector coupling is used . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological constraints suggest that this self - energy correction reduces the nucleon s mass by up to several hundred mev . </S>",
    "<S> that effect does not qualitatively alter the picture , suggested by the faddeev equation , that baryons are quark - diquark composites . </S>",
    "<S> however , neglecting the @xmath2-loops leads to a quantitative overestimate of the nucleon s axial - vector diquark component . </S>"
