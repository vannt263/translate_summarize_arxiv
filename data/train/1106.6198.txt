    "within the last decade vortex ratchets , which exploit asymmetric vortex dynamics , have been attracting considerable attention  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in essence , the vortex ratchet is a system where the vortex can acquire a net motion in an asymmetric periodic pinning potential ( ppp ) in the presence of deterministic or stochastic forces with time averages of zero  ( for comprehensive reviews , see  @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the ppp refers to the current direction reversal .",
    "there are essentially two different ways to realize such a pinning potential asymmetry .",
    "first , the spatial inversion symmetry of the ppp itself can be broken intrinsically and involves some kind of periodic and asymmetric pinning potential , also known as a _",
    "rocking ratchet_. a second option is that an initially symmetric ppp , if externally biased , i.e. , subjected to an additive constant driving force , results in an effective asymmetric pinning potential .",
    "this is called a tilted - potential ratchet or a _ tilting ratchet_. irrespective of the way to bring the asymmetry into a system , from a practical viewpoint , the common feature of superconducting ratchets is their rectifying property : the application of an ac current to a superconductor with an asymmetric ppp landscape can produce vortex motion whose direction is determined only by the asymmetry of the pinning potential .",
    "a considerable amount of theoretical work about the general properties of different types of ratchet systems exists  @xcite .",
    "such ratchet systems range from the use of josephson junctions in superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) and arrays  @xcite , to the use of one- or two - dimensional potential - energy ratchets allowing one to construct fluxon pumps and lenses  @xcite , and drive fluxons out of superconducting samples  @xcite . whereas the majority of ratchet proposals rely on single particles interacting with an external potential to produce the dc response , collective interactions between particles needed to produce dc transport have also been considered previously  @xcite . at the same time in experiments",
    ", initially asymmetric ppps have been used rather than dc - biased ones so far .",
    "for instance , the vortex lattice ratchet effect has been investigated in nb films sputtered on arrays of nanometric ni triangles , which produce the asymmetric ppp  @xcite .",
    "similar effects were also discussed for ybco films with antidots  @xcite .",
    "the voltage rectification in superconducting al films patterned with either asymmetric or symmetric antidots and subjected to an ac driving current , dc - biased in the symmetric case , has been experimentally observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . among other experimental works on the vortex ratchet effect in nano - patterned superconductors ,",
    "two substantial recent papers  @xcite  @xcite should be mentioned .",
    "d.  perez de lara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have investigated ratchet effects in thin nb films grown on top of arrays of ni nanotriangles subjected to an ac current with a frequency up to 10 khz , so that effects observed in that work  @xcite were adiabatic , i.e. , independent on ac frequency . only recently , b.  b. jin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have experimentally investigated a very important issue in the vortex ratchet study , namely the frequency dependence of the dc voltage at large amplitudes of the ac driving force in a frequency range between 0.5  mhz and 2  ghz . as it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , ac frequencies were always lower than 1 mhz in vortex ratchet measurements up to that work  @xcite ( see refs .  [ 14 - 20 ] therein ) .",
    "so far , a full temperature - dependent theoretical description of the superconducting devices proposed in refs .  [ 9 - 13 ] is not available due to the complexity of the two - dimensional ppp used in these references .",
    "in particular , the theoretical explanation of the experimental results of the vortex flow along the vortex channeling directions in the above - mentioned structures is a difficult problem .",
    "below we propose to experimentally study ratchet properties on nanostructured thin - film superconductors  @xcite with an uniaxial , i.e. , _ washboard _ pinning potential ( wpp ) .",
    "uniaxiality of the proposed potential does not mean that the physics of vortex motion in a symmetric wpp , tilted by an external dc bias , becomes one - dimensional as the angular component of the moving force could simply be regarded as changing the strength of the wpp .",
    "besides the two limiting cases of transversal and longitudinal geometry , when the vortices move across or along the wpp channels , respectively , one has to consider for all intermediate angles not only longitudinal , but also transverse ratchet effect  @xcite , where the last appears due to the guided vortex motion along the wpp channels .",
    "in the present work , however , we will use the transverse geometry only to provide the reader with most intuitive figure data and to simplify the subsequent analysis . whereas the model allows one to obtain exact expressions for the magneto - resistivities at any intermediate current angles with regard to the wpp channels ,",
    "general formulas for the responses have been provided recently  @xcite . in that work",
    "@xcite , a full and exact theoretical description of the nonlinear in current and temperature vortex dynamics in the ratchet devices have been performed in the single - vortex approximation , i.e. , for non - interacting vortices , within the framework of the langevin equation .",
    "it should be noted that theoretical predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite lack experimental scrutiny so far , especially at microwave and ghz frequencies . for this reason",
    ", throughout this paper where applicable , we will be referring to the results of b.  b. jin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as a most closely related experimental work to our new tilted - ratchet results , though that work  @xcite is dealing with a rocking ratchet .    in more detail ,",
    "the mixed - state resistive response of superconducting films has been theoretically investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the high frequency and strong amplitude regime of the ac vortex transport in the presence of a dc bias , which invokes a definite tilt of the cosine pinning potential , taking nonzero temperature fluctuations also into account .",
    "the exact solution of this nonlinear and time - dependent problem , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of a matrix continued fraction , included only general formulas for the ac and dc magnetoresistive responses .",
    "these will be elaborated in detail in this paper and applied to the study of both the dc ratchet electric field response and the absorbed ac power dependences on the ac amplitude and frequency at fixed temperature for arbitrary dc biases allowing one to adjust the asymmetry of the ppp .",
    "the aim of this paper is to physically analyze the tilted - ratchet problem on the basis of the single - vortex model in order to determine those `` intrinsic '' tilted - ratchet effects in the vortex dynamics which arise from the tilt of initially symmetric wpp as the only reason .",
    "in addition , this model allows one to study theoretically the exact ratchet behavior of absorbed power at strong ac amplitude and arbitrary frequency , i.e. , the subject which has not been studied in any known for us previous theoretical work even for usual vortex ac response . as a result , two groups of new findings have been obtained .",
    "exact formulas for ( i ) the dc voltage ratchet response and ( ii ) absorbed power in ac response will be discussed as functions of ac current amplitude and frequency as well as dc current induced tilt , in a wide range of corresponding dimensionless parameters .",
    "experimentally , the obtained results can be verified on superconducting films with a wpp , similar to those used in refs .",
    "@xcite . from the viewpoint of basic research",
    ", it will be pointed out which new ratchet effects in the vortex dynamics appear even within the single - vortex approximation . besides",
    ", a further development of the theory towards the consideration of an asymmetric - potential ratchet will allow one to distinguish tilted - ratchet effects from potential asymmetry - induced effects when considering an asymmetric wpp in the presence of a dc tilting bias .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and summarize the expressions for dc and ac ratchet responses , obtained in terms of a matrix continued fraction . in sec .",
    "iii we graphically analyze these quantities as functions of their driving parameters , namely dc bias , ac amplitude , and frequency . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss in detail two limiting cases , the adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes , and explain peculiarities in the ratchet responses on the basis of either the static current - voltage characteristics or solution in terms of the bessel functions , respectively . in sec .",
    "v we conclude with a general discussion of our results outlining the difference between the intrinsic and tilted - ratchet models elucidating their applicability and drawing parallels between our theoretical results and a recent experiment  @xcite .",

    "one of the main questions in the study of the function @xmath77 given by eq",
    ".   relies upon the determination of the frequency and dc bias dependences of the ac amplitude threshold value , @xmath78 , which can be considered as an ac critical current magnitude for the dc ratchet response @xmath75 such that @xmath79 for @xmath80 . to accomplish this , we begin the graphical analysis with the ac amplitude dependence of the dc ratchet response considering specific features in @xmath81 at low ( @xmath82 ) , intermediate ( @xmath83 ) , and high ( @xmath84 ) frequencies for similar tilts , as depicted in fig .  3 .",
    "consider at first the curves in fig .",
    "3.a with @xmath82 which corresponds to the adiabatic ratchet response . at large @xmath85 , for all the curves @xmath86 .",
    "these values will be explained in sec .",
    "iv in a rather simple manner as this asymptotic behavior follows from eq .   for @xmath87 at @xmath88 with ( @xmath89 ) denoting the even component of @xmath90 regarding the change @xmath91 .",
    "at small @xmath85 values , we observe different behavior for curves with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , namely for @xmath94 and @xmath95 the ratchet response is a threshold - free one , whereas a threshold value , @xmath96 , separates the non - dissipative and dissipative states at @xmath93 .",
    "the magnitude of the threshold is a decreasing function of @xmath97 and , in fact , is equal to @xmath98 which is evident for the adiabatic case .",
    "the physical reason of the above difference follows from the fact that at @xmath99 and @xmath92 the vortex is in the _ running _ state with a slightly oscillating instantaneous velocity @xmath100 and thus , nonzero electric field @xmath90 , whereas for @xmath93 the vortex is localized in one of the wpp wells .    transferring from low ( @xmath82 ) to intermediate ( @xmath83 ) frequencies ,",
    "several new distinctive features appear in fig .",
    "3.b in comparison with the adiabatic case .",
    "first , the threshold values @xmath101 are larger than those ensuing for @xmath82 at similar subcritical dc tilts , i.e. , @xmath93 . to illustrate this in detail , we plot the @xmath102 dependence in fig .  4 for a set of biases .",
    "all the curves demonstrate qualitatively similar behavior , i.e. , a zero plateau at @xmath80 , a linear dependence at large @xmath103 , and a nonlinear transition in between at @xmath104 .",
    "these segments correspond to the adiabatic , intermediate , and high - frequency modes which are roughly separated by the straight lines @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted , that the curves @xmath102 in fig .",
    "4 , calculated in the present work for the dc - tilted cosine pinning potential , are qualitatively similar to those obtained experimentally on superconducting pb films with a non - tilted ratchet ppp ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and fig .  5 therein ) .",
    "the transition frequency from the adiabatic to nonadiabatic case has been found at about 1  mhz for that system  @xcite .",
    "second , a difference in the @xmath77 behavior appears between @xmath107 , which looks like damped oscillating curves , and the curves at @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which look like curves with phase - locked regions ( steps ) in @xmath85 . whereas at small @xmath97 phase - locked regions ensue at @xmath79 , at strong biases @xmath109 these flat segments appear at @xmath110 . in sec .  iv this will be discussed in detail within an approximate bessel - function approach , originally presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and used later  @xcite for @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite numerically calculated the langevin equation in order to obtain the so - called dynamical current - voltage characteristics ( cvcs ) of the resistively shunted josephson junction model , which is equivalent to the model used here to analytically derive the dc ratchet - response solution @xmath77 ( notice the curve @xmath111 in fig .",
    "7.a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in our model ,",
    "the corresponding langevin equation with noise has been exactly solved in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see eq .",
    "( 9 ) therein ) and will be discussed in the noise - less limit ( eq .   in sec .",
    "iii ) to clarify the origin of the steps in fig .",
    "lastly , consider the curves in fig .",
    "3.c at @xmath84 . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that for @xmath92 , the ratchet responses @xmath75 are continuously oscillating curves without thresholds . on the contrary , for @xmath93 the responses have thresholds whose magnitudes decrease with increasing @xmath97 . as in the previous case , an interesting property of the dependence @xmath77 in figs .  2.b , c is the possibility for @xmath75 to decrease periodically ( sometimes down to zero ) with increase of the driving amplitude @xmath85 .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath75 is in contrast to the behavior of the usual dc - driven cvcs , even though in the presence of @xmath85 , as these are always increasing functions of @xmath97 .",
    "now we turn to the analysis of the frequency dependences of the ratchet response @xmath75 taken at fixed @xmath85 and @xmath97 , as represented in fig .  5 for small ( @xmath112 ) , intermediate ( @xmath113 ) and strong ( @xmath114 ) ac amplitudes .",
    "at small ac drives @xmath112 ( see fig .",
    "5.a ) the curves vanish regardless of the frequency at small tilts @xmath115 .",
    "this behavior is evident , since if both the tilt value and ac drive amplitude are small , the vortices are localized at the bottoms of the wpp wells which results in a non - dissipative state . with the gradual increase of the bias , for determinacy from @xmath116 to @xmath117 , the situation changes dramatically . at low frequencies",
    "the voltage drop gets substantially higher , whereas a zero - voltage tail spreads over the high - frequency range .",
    "the former is a consequence of the _ running _ vortex state , whereas the latter is a clear signature of the _ localized _ vortex state .",
    "these regions are separated by a threshold frequency @xmath118 , which is in fact already depicted in fig .",
    "4 and , as evident from the latter plot , is strongly dependent on both , @xmath97 and @xmath85 ( compare with the curves in fig .",
    "5.b for @xmath113 ) .",
    "the tilt , @xmath97 , determines the asymmetry of the wpp and the time needed for a vortex to get from one to the next wpp well , whereas @xmath85 represents the ac driving force for a vortex which also competes with the height of the initially symmetric wpp .",
    "this physically means that , if the ac driving frequency @xmath119 is much less than the depinning frequency @xmath120 , the running state of the vortex appears and it can visit several potential wells during the ac period . for a fixed ac amplitude @xmath85 and frequency @xmath119 , the number of visited wells increases strongly with the increase of the tilt , thus resulting in a shift of the threshold frequency towards higher @xmath119 .",
    "another interesting feature in the @xmath121 curves appears as a maximum at @xmath106 .",
    "its magnitude increases with increase of the frequency .",
    "the behavior of @xmath122 plotted for @xmath114 in fig .",
    "5.c , as representative for strong ac drives , can be summarized as follows . in the adiabatic limit , when @xmath123 , the function @xmath122 coincides with the tilt values @xmath97 . at high frequencies",
    "@xmath124 , the curves either attenuate rapidly for subcritical tilts @xmath93 or approach a constant value for @xmath92 . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "when @xmath106 , the curves oscillate until the maximum is reached , followed by the subsequent rapid decrease of the function @xmath122 .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the pronounced reduction of the time @xmath125 with @xmath126 being the ac period , over which the moving force on the vortex keeps its direction . as a result",
    ", the vortex may not longer visit several wpp wells , since the vortex displacement during @xmath126 is smaller than the wpp period @xmath19 , even at strong ac amplitudes @xmath85 .",
    "summarizing , the calculated ratchet behavior of @xmath77 differs substantially for a wide range of frequencies @xmath119 , ac amplitudes @xmath85 and dc biases @xmath97 . throughout the frequency range",
    "this include a cut - off filter behavior of the function @xmath77 with decreasing @xmath85 and increasing @xmath119 .",
    "in addition , at @xmath108 and @xmath109 the curves demonstrate phase - locked peculiarities reminiscent of shapiro steps  @xcite as well as a damped oscillatory behavior at @xmath107 .      in this subsection",
    "we first consider the behavior of the absorbed ac power @xmath56 , calculated as function of the dimensionless dc density @xmath97 , ac density @xmath85 , and frequency @xmath119 in sec .",
    "v.e of ref .",
    "then we consider the graphs for @xmath77 and @xmath128 in comparison with each other .    before entering the discussion it is useful to remember  @xcite that @xmath60 , where @xmath129 is the relaxation time and @xmath120 is the depinning frequency calculated in the linear ac approximation at @xmath130 .",
    "we have to point out that the bias dependences for the critical frequency @xmath131 introduced in the previous subsection and the depinning frequency @xmath132 are qualitatively opposite . whereas the frequency dependence of the first shapiro - like anomaly in @xmath133 is given by the well - known expression @xmath134",
    "@xcite for overcritical biases , the dependence for the depinning frequency @xmath135 has been obtained in the linear ac approximation at @xmath136 and for subcritical tilts at @xmath137 only recently  @xcite .",
    "thereby , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that @xmath138 decreases with increasing @xmath97 at @xmath139 .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath138 at low temperature ( @xmath140 ) , i.e. , when the creep factor @xmath141 ( see eq .",
    "( 107 ) in  @xcite ) is small , follows from the fact that for low frequencies @xmath142 ( or @xmath123 ) pinning forces dominate and the vortex resistivity response @xmath143 , being proportional to the absorbed power @xmath56 , is nondissipative ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas at high frequencies @xmath144 ( or @xmath145 ) frictional forces dominate and @xmath143 is dissipative .",

    "@xcite it was shown that @xmath149 plays the same role for the ac response as @xmath42 for the dc response .",
    "proceeding now to the analysis of the dependences @xmath150 , let us recall that to accomplish this in the case @xmath63 , it is sufficient to calculate the ac resistivity @xmath151 as function of its parameters , as presented in figs .  5 and 6",

    "the physics of this threshold was earlier discussed for @xmath158 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "6 ) and for our adiabatic case ( @xmath82 ) may be connected with the @xmath138 dependence . at subcritical ac drives and overcritical biases , e.g. , at @xmath94 , as a consequence of the running vortex state , @xmath159 acquires large values . with the gradual increase of @xmath85",
    "the curves exhibit a weak minimum and finally approach unity .    in the case of intermediate frequency ( see fig .",
    "6.b for @xmath83 ) the curves @xmath152 start from a nonzero value regardless the bias @xmath97 .",
    "a different behavior at subcritical and overcritical tilts should be noted . at overcritical biases the running state for the vortex appears and the response is a consequence of this motion with a slightly oscillating instantaneous velocity . on the contrary , at subcritical tilts",
    "the vortex is in the oscillating state and if the frequency of the external excitation exceeds the depinning frequency @xmath138 , a nonzero response appears as a result of the averaging of this oscillations .",
    "the bias dependence at @xmath93 in the limit of small ac drives and @xmath123 has been discussed above .",
    "proceeding with the analysis of the curves shown in fig .",
    "6.b it should be noted that at small biases @xmath160 the curves increase monotonically , whereas at sufficiently large tilt values , e.g. , at @xmath161 a pronounced minimum appears . at overcritical biases",
    "this can lead to a sign change in @xmath152 in both @xmath85 and @xmath97 .",
    "this evidence is represented in detail in fig .  7 overcritical tilts and weak ac drives .",
    "figure 7 illustrates the presence of the singular point @xmath162 in @xmath163 at nonzero both the ac current amplitude and the temperature .",
    "a similar singularity in the josephson junction impedance problem has been discussed previously in the limit of small ac amplitude at zero temperature  @xcite . here",
    "we show that such a singularity does not vanish at nonzero temperature in the presence of subcritical ac amplitude @xmath164 .",
    "this evidence was left out of the scope of that work  @xcite .",
    "proceeding with the description of this anomaly it should be noted , that the dependence of @xmath152 on @xmath85 is less sharp than in @xmath97 .",
    "as far as high temperatures smear the singularity in both @xmath85 and @xmath97 , the minimum can be more pronounced if considered at lower temperatures ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "considering @xmath152 at high frequencies in fig .",
    "6.c , it is evident that @xmath152 approaches unity even at small @xmath85 which again corresponds to the case @xmath166 .",

    "8.a ) the curves demonstrate either monotonic behavior for @xmath160 or pronounced non - monotonic behavior for @xmath168 .",
    "the monotonic curves at @xmath130 agree with the results of coffey and clem  @xcite who calculated in linear approximation in @xmath85 the temperature dependence of the depinning frequency in a nontilted cosine pinning potential .",
    "in contrast to this monotonic behavior , the nonmonotonic curves ( @xmath168 ) demonstrate two characteristic features .",
    "first , a pronounced power absorption in the adiabatic regime .",
    "second , a deep minimum in the power absorption at @xmath106 .",
    "the appearance of this frequency- and temperature dependent minimum was discussed in more detail in ref .  @xcite . with the gradual increase of @xmath85 , the value @xmath159 at low frequencies",
    "remains the same , whereas the minimum shifts towards higher frequencies ( see fig .",

    "these can be smeared in turn when considered at higher temperatures ( @xmath170 ) .    at strong ac drives , as represented in fig .",
    "8.c for @xmath114 , already at very low frequencies @xmath123 all the curves @xmath159 acquire large values and approach unity at high frequencies @xmath145 .",
    "even though peculiarities in the dependence @xmath171 seem to be pronounced in the intermediate frequency range , they are sufficiently weak in comparison with those in fig .",
    "8.b when @xmath113 .",
    "a further increase of @xmath85 leads to slightly distorted curves throughout the frequency range .",
    "the main results of this subsection can be summarized as follows .",
    "the power absorption in the ac response has been considered in terms of the ac resistivity @xmath159 as a function of its driving parameters , @xmath85 , @xmath119 , and @xmath97 .",
    "while in the limiting cases of small ac current in the absence of dc bias the well - known results of coffey and clem follow  @xcite and at strong dc biases a large power absorption results , in agreement with the curves reported previously  @xcite , the appearance of a sign change in @xmath172 at a certain range of ac drives @xmath85 at overcritical biases @xmath97 is predicted for the first time in the present work .",
    "in this section , two physically different limiting cases at low and high frequencies will be considered at zero temperature ( i.e. @xmath173 ) to augment the previous analysis with a more intuitive and visual interpretation .",
    "the first case we consider is the adiabatic regime with @xmath123 . to discuss the dc ratchet response @xmath90 in this limit",
    ", we employ static cvcs ( see eqs .   and   below ) with @xmath174 and average @xmath175 over the driving period @xmath176 . in this limit ( @xmath177 ) , while @xmath178 the vortex may visit many potential wells of the wpp during the time @xmath125 , i.e. , when the moving force on the vortex keeps its direction .",
    "the second case is the non - adiabatic case with @xmath145 . in this limit ,",
    "the vortex displacement during the time @xmath126 may be smaller than the wpp period @xmath19 , even at strong ac densities @xmath85 and the langevin equation for a vortex can be solved in terms of the bessel functions as detailed below .",
    "we consider the vortex motion in a wpp , tilted by a dc bias @xmath93 , and subjected to an ac drive with @xmath177 .",
    "our objective is to qualitatively point out why a rectified dc voltage appears in response to the ac input @xmath85 . to accomplish this",
    ", we first consider the dc cvcs for the cosine wpp ( see eqs .  ) in the absence of an initial tilt , viz .",
    ", @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 is the well - known nonlinear vortex mobility under the influence of the dimensionless generalized moving force @xmath182 in the @xmath45-direction ( see eq .  52 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . from eq",
    ".   follows , that @xmath183 is an even function of @xmath182 , i.  e. @xmath184 , whereas @xmath185 is an odd function of @xmath182 , i.  e. @xmath186 . the functions @xmath183 and @xmath185 are shown in fig .",
    "9.a and fig .  9.b , respectively .",
    "as the cosine wpp is symmetric , i.  e. @xmath187 , it can establish ratchet properties only when tilted , i.e. , we change @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the tilting dc bias .",
    "it is easy to see that depending on the sign of @xmath189 , the tilt leads to the shift of @xmath190 and @xmath191 along the @xmath182-axis by the value @xmath192 to the left ( for @xmath193 ) or to the right ( for @xmath194 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "9.c where @xmath195 for definiteness . in this case @xmath196 where @xmath197    whereas @xmath185 and @xmath183 are odd and even functions of @xmath182 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , from eqs .   and   follows that in the presence of a tilt @xmath198 and @xmath199 are neither even , nor odd in @xmath182 for @xmath200 . in the following",
    "it is suitable to present @xmath201 as @xmath202 where @xmath203/2\\ ] ] and @xmath204 are the even and odd parts of @xmath201 with respect to change @xmath205 .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath206 because when we change the sign of the full current [ i.  e. ( @xmath207 , then @xmath90 will be an odd function of the full current .",
    "if we then apply the @xmath208-operation to @xmath90 given by eq .   and take into account eq .  , we arrive at the important conclusion that @xmath209 from eq .",
    "it follows that @xmath210 .",
    "this means @xmath175 changes its sign when changing the sign of @xmath189 , whereas @xmath211 does not change its sign . from the physical viewpoint",
    "it means that @xmath175 , even in @xmath182 and odd in @xmath189 , is responsible for the ratchet response , whereas @xmath212 , which is odd in @xmath182 and even in @xmath189 , describes the usual cvcs response , analogous at @xmath213 to that at @xmath214 . actually , if we take into account that from eq .",
    "follows @xmath215 , then from eq .   at",
    "once follows that @xmath216 @xmath217    at last , let us perform the change @xmath218 and consider the function @xmath219 , since this represents a more close correlation with the exact results obtained by using eq .",
    "to derive the average dc ratchet solution @xmath220 in response to to the input current @xmath221 , one needs to integrate the function @xmath90 over the ac current period @xmath126 @xmath222 equation   can be reduced to the sum of two integrals @xmath223,\\ ] ] with the integrals to be taken over @xmath224 only where @xmath225 is nonzero in accordance with eq .  ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath226    equation   can be rewritten in another equivalent form @xmath227 which represents the even component of the dc ratchet response and will be compared next with the temperature - dependent response @xmath228 .",
    "we now take a closer look at figure  9 considering firstly the curves @xmath198 ( solid ) and @xmath229 ( dash ) in fig .",
    "as it follows from eq .  , @xmath198 is zero at @xmath230 as far as @xmath229 vanishes at @xmath231 .",
    "a rapid increase in both the functions in @xmath182 in the vicinity to @xmath232 and @xmath233 should be noted . in the adiabatic limit ( see eq .  ) , @xmath175 and @xmath212 are shown in fig .",
    "9.c by dash dot and dot lines , respectively .",
    "they inherit both the bump - like peculiarities in @xmath234 at @xmath233 .",
    "next we turn to fig .",
    "9.d where adiabatic ( eq .  , dash dot ) , approximate ( eq .  , crosses ) , and exact ( eq .  , solid ) ratchet responses are shown together .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of all the curves is in agreement with eq .  .",
    "peculiarities are highly pronounced in the adiabatic solution  , calculated in fact in response to the square wave ac current .",
    "in contrast to this , the approximate ratchet solution   for the cosine ac current practically coincides with the exact solution   calculated in the limit of very small frequencies @xmath235 and very low temperature @xmath236 .    by this way",
    ", we conclude that the simple approach in terms of the static cvcs can explain qualitatively the form of the curves @xmath228 in fig .",
    "3.a in the adiabatic limit",
    ". a good quantitative agreement between the approximate and exact solutions is revealed at very low frequencies and temperatures .      in order to explain qualitatively the results of the exact calculations of @xmath77 at low temperatures ( @xmath237 ) , presented in fig .",
    "3b , c for intermediate and high frequencies ( @xmath238 and @xmath145 ) of the @xmath127 driving force , we use a more simple approach which ignores the noise ( @xmath173 ) . in this limit , the equation of motion for the dimensionless vortex coordinate @xmath239 ( see eq .",
    "( 9 ) in  @xcite ) reduces to @xmath240 which is analogous to the well - known equation of motion for the phase difference in the @xmath127-driven resistively shunted josephson - junction model  @xcite at zero temperature . for high and intermediate frequencies ( @xmath145 and @xmath238 ) and for @xmath241 eq .   can be approximately analyzed and solved in the spirit of the ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite . in these limiting cases",
    "we simply assume that the velocity of the vortex is sinusoidal in accordance with @xmath242 and determine the constant @xmath243 by requiring that @xmath244 satisfies eq .  .",
    "having integrated eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath245 where @xmath246 is a second constant to be determined . substituting eq .   into eq .   and using the expansion of @xmath247 in a harmonic series according to formulas originally suggested by shapiro et .",

    "@xmath246 is an arbitrary coordinate . for values @xmath243",
    "that are not integral multiples of @xmath119 , the term @xmath252 does not contribute a constant component to eq .  , and equating the constant terms yields ( after averaging over one period for locking into the @xmath253-th region ) @xmath254    in order to use these results for the explanation of the behavior of @xmath255 ( see fig .",
    "3.b ) we consider two cases .",
    "the first case considers @xmath95 for which at @xmath99 the vortex is in the running state . from fig .",
    "( 9 ) we see , however , that for @xmath256 the value of @xmath75 is locked into the phase of the ac periodic driving at @xmath257 ( see eq .  ) . from eq .",
    "follows that for @xmath258 at @xmath95 and @xmath83 this equation has no solution at any value of @xmath246 . for @xmath257",
    "we have @xmath259 at @xmath260 values which satisfy the condition @xmath261 and strictly correspond to the phase - locked regions for this curve . between these regions @xmath90 has a bump - like form with an increasing width and decreasing height with the increase of @xmath85 . for @xmath262",
    "has no solution .",
    "the second case deals with @xmath263 , for which at @xmath80 the vortex is in the locked state with @xmath258 . in this case",
    "the equation @xmath264 has many solutions ( see fig .",
    "11 ) . considering @xmath257 leads to the equation @xmath265 which has no solution , however .",
    "in this work we proposed an exactly solvable two - dimensional model structure for the study of the frequency - dependent ratchet effect in superconducting film with a symmetric planar pinning potential , tilted by a dc bias , also known as a tilted ratchet .",
    "we have theoretically examined the strongly nonlinear nonadiabatic tilted ratchet behavior of the two - dimensional vortex system of a superconductor as a function of the ( ac+dc ) transport current density @xmath266 , the frequency @xmath14 , and the temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the nonlinear ( in @xmath266 ) resistive behavior of the anisotropic vortex ensemble is be caused by the presence of anisotropic pinning with the symmetry of the ppp .",
    "it is physically obvious that such a pinning at low enough temperatures leads to anisotropy of the vortex dynamics since it is much easier for vortices to move along the pinning channels ( the guiding effect in the flux - flow regime , which is linear in the current ) than in the perpendicular direction , where it is necessary for them to overcome the pinning potential barriers .",
    "the latter is also a source of nonlinearity of the dc+ac responses .",
    "if under variation of one of the `` external '' driving parameters @xmath266 , @xmath25 , and @xmath62 , the intensity of the manifestation of the indicated nonlinearity is weakened , this weakening will lead to an `` effective isotropization '' of the vortex dynamics , i.e. , to a convergence ( and in the limit of the absence of nonlinearity , to coincidence ) of the directions of the mean velocity vector of the vortices and the lorentz force  @xcite .",
    "it is physically clear that current , temperature , and angle @xmath62 have qualitatively different effects on the weakening of the pinning and the corresponding transition from anisotropic vortex dynamics to isotropic . with the growth of @xmath266 the lorentz force @xmath267 grows and the height of the potential barrier decreases , so for @xmath268 these barriers essentially disappear . here",
    "@xmath269 are the crossover currents for these transitions to occur regarding the right- and left - hand ppp barriers .",
    "the quantities @xmath269 depend on @xmath62 by virtue of the fact that the probability of overcoming the barrier is governed not by the magnitude of the force @xmath270 , but only by its transverse component @xmath271 , so that @xmath272 grows with increasing of @xmath62 .",
    "since an increase in temperature @xmath25 always increases the probability of overcoming the pinning barrier , the transition to isotropization of the vortex dynamics is much steeper in @xmath25 , the smaller the pinning barrier is .",
    "however , although general formulas for the ratchet responses ( see eqs .  - ) include both , the angle and temperature dependences , in the present work we used @xmath63 and @xmath67 for simplicity .",
    "proceeding now to a short description of the main theoretical results , we note here that an exact analytical representation of the nonlinear ac - driven rachet response of the investigated system in terms of a matrix continued fraction was possible thanks to the use of a simple but physically realistic model of anisotropic pinning with a tilted cosine wpp .",
    "the exact solution obtained made it possible for the first time to consistently analyze not only the qualitatively clear vortex dynamics of the adiabatic ratchet effect , but also the nontrivial ratchet behavior at intermediate and high frequencies of the ac drive .",
    "below we turn to a short presentation of our results taken in comparison with experimental results , presented recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first of all , simple inspection of our exact expressions   for the dc ratchet response shows that a magnetic field inversion does not change the sign of @xmath273 , as on the right side of eqs .",
    "the @xmath274-components do not depend on the index @xmath253 , which determines the @xmath275-inversion . on the other hand",
    ", we should point out that for the adiabatic ratchet studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for the asymmetric ppp without dc bias , the dc response changes its sign after @xmath275-inversion ( see eq .  ( 16 ) therein ) . since",
    "a clear sign change in @xmath276 has been experimentally observed at field inversion  @xcite , we conclude that the dc ratchet response in that work should be described by a model with an asymmetry of the ppp  @xcite .",
    "an another interesting difference between the tilted ratchet described in the present paper and the asymmetric ratchet without a tilt  @xcite consists in their asymptotic behavior at @xmath277 in the adiabatic regime . in this limit ,",
    "the tilted ratchet adiabatic response is finite and equal to the tilt value , as one can see from eq .",
    "( 16 ) at @xmath278 , whereas for the asymmetric ratchet this response is zero because @xmath279  @xcite .",
    "comparing our frequency - dependent results with analogous experimental findings presented in ref .",
    "@xcite we should underline that in spite of the simple wpp and the single - vortex approximation used in our theoretical model we , however , can qualitatively explain from one and the same point of view main experimental results of that work .",
    "in particular , our expressions   and   describe ( i )  the critical ac current dependence in a wide frequency range covering the transition from adiabatic to nonadiabatic , with both , a frequency - independent plateau at low frequencies , a direct dependence at high frequencies and a nonlinear transition in between , ( ii )  the appearance of phase - locking regions in the dependence of @xmath276 on @xmath280 , ( iii )  a weakening of the ratchet effect at extremely high frequencies , and ( iv ) the possibility of a sign change for the absorbed power in ac response within a certain range of the driving parameters .",
    "this is in contradistinction to different explanations used in  @xcite , which is a consequence of the absence of a well - defined theoretical model due to the complexity of the ppp employed . in particular , due to this reason the authors  @xcite compelled to employ different approaches for the explanation of their experimental results , such as introducing sometimes the vortex mass , or appealing to the vortex - vortex interaction , or not taking into account the tilting parameter , or leaving uncommented the high frequency power absorption behavior .",
    "it should be stressed that the single vortex approximation used in this work may only be valid at small magnetic fields preferably less than the first matching field , so no collective effects are captured in the model considered here .",
    "whereas vortex ratchet reversals as a function of field have been studied by authors in a number of simulations and experimental works and have been explaining as a result of collective effects , such as vortex - vortex interactions  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , a remark on the extension of our theoretical study is now to be made .",
    "as far as the model described in the present paper refers to the tilted - potential ratchet , a thorough theoretical description of the rocking - ratchet response in superconducting films with an asymmetric wpp is currently under way and will be reported in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "there will be shown that the single - vortex approximation can also lead to the ratchet reversals , when we consider an asymmetric wpp in the presence of a tilting bias .",
    "finally , we would like to stress , that our exactly solvable single - vortex model explicitly shows that many important and interesting nonlinear ratchet effects , which can be observed in particular at high frequencies , follow even from such a simple model for one vortex in periodic ratchet wpp .",
    "though experimental verification of the predictions of both the models can be performed , for instance , on nb thin films with nano - fabricated wpp landscapes  @xcite , the first portion of ratchet data still remains to be seen .",
