    "<S> similar studies have been performed e.g. with cold rb atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , where differences in scattering length for different spin states lead to such dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us consider the many - particle scenario . </S>",
    "<S> to this aim we apply a two - mode approximation in which the quantum field operator is expanded in the local modes @xmath77 of the double well potential , that is , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) with @xmath81 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of an atom in the left or right well . </S>",

    "<S> we recall that the above outlined two - mode model enables to identify , depending on the ratio @xmath89 , three different regimes  @xcite : the``rabi '' regime ( i.e. , weak atom - atom interaction ) ; the intermediate `` josephson '' regime , and the `` fock '' regime ( i.e. , strong atom - atom interaction ) . in our study </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the rabi and fock regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that depending on the internal state of the ion , it is possible to induce either `` rabi '' oscillations between the two wells or to keep the condensate trapped in a single well ( i.e. , the self - trapping regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to introduce the interaction parameter @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> self - trapping regime is predicted to occur for @xmath91  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now the on - site interaction energy can be estimated by using the single - particle wave functions leading to @xmath92 with @xmath93  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we neglected terms such as @xmath94 , which are much smaller than @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> then , in order to quantify the quality of the description in localized wavepackets , which is crucial for the bh model , we calculate the probability @xmath96 of finding the atoms in the wrong region , namely @xmath97 , and the integral taken over @xmath98 , the right half space , ( @xmath99 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a weaker trap , such that both the rabi and the self - trapping regimes are achieved for a relatively large number of atoms . by choosing @xmath100  200  hz ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath102  @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , the two - mode approximation requires @xmath103 and we find the following parameters : @xmath104  0.9  hz , @xmath105  1.7  hz for @xmath61 ( @xmath106 ) with @xmath107 . whereas for negative scattering lengths @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath109 , we have @xmath110  1.0  hz , @xmath111  42.7  hz with @xmath112 . for @xmath113 atoms we have @xmath114 ( i.e. , self - trapping regime ) and @xmath115 ( i.e. , the rabi regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting bh dynamics is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : becdynamics ] , which clearly shows that large scale entanglement can be achieved . for @xmath116 atoms </S>",

    "<S> for @xmath119 , i.e. ( @xmath120 ) , we have for @xmath113 atoms @xmath121 and for @xmath116 atoms @xmath122 .    we underscore , however , that in the self - trapping regime the bh - model is in disagreement with the full numerical many - body calculation especially at long time scales  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time scales are set by the rabi period @xmath123 . with the above outlined parameters we find : @xmath124  ( 8) for @xmath61  @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we might expect reasonable agreement between the bose - hubbard model and a full quantum many body calculation at short times , that is , @xmath126 but @xmath127 and not too far into the self - trapping regime , as in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , width=264 ]    we will now discuss some of the limitations of our model and possible experimental issues . as we already noted before , </S>",
    "<S> the atom and ion could change their spin states in a collision  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the ion is in the state @xmath46 , spin changing collisions can not happen due to the conservation of the quantum number @xmath128 : there are no other states with @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> when the ion is in the state @xmath48 , @xmath130 , we have to consider the mixing with the states @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 </S>",
    "<S> . however , all these states have significantly higher dissociation energies , since the hyperfine splitting of @xmath1yb@xmath2 ( 12.6  ghz ) is much larger than that of @xmath0rb ( 6.8  ghz ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , only resonances with bound states can occur , which have a much lower density than trap states . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we can reasonably assume that also for @xmath134 no spin flips occur .    concerning inelastic collisions , it is important to note that our proposal requires low atomic densities . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the peak density of the atomic wavepackets to be about @xmath135/m@xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> now , assuming that many - body interactions do not perturb significantly the form of the wavefunction , this would lead to loss rates of a few hz  @xcite . secondly , </S>",
    "<S> in our proposal the atoms and ion are not directly overlapped , the ion rather perturbs the atomic wavefunction while it is held in its own trapping potential , reducing the density and terefore the inelastic scattering a factor @xmath13710 more . </S>",
    "<S> this setup may also reduce heating due to the micromotion of the ion in its time - dependent trap  @xcite . however , even in the presence of moderate inelastic collision rates , our proposal could be implemented , since these effects are easily separated from experimental errors : one would simply observe that there is no ( yb@xmath2 ) ion at the end of the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding cooling and heating mechanisms , we first note that the ion can be cooled to the ground state with effectively unit efficiency using sideband coolings . </S>",
    "<S> however , given the time scales required for the proposed experiments , heating may cause problems . in state of the art ion traps , such as in  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> heating rates of a few phonons / s are achieved , such that an experiment on the tens of ms timescale should be possible . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence of the atomic wavepacket can be sustained for tens of ms even for well - separations of several @xmath3 m  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we mention that josephson junctions for cold atoms have been implemented in optical dipole traps and in micro - fabricated magnetic traps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such systems can be combined with ion trap technology . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting approach would be to integrate atom and ion traps in a single micro - trap . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have demonstrated micro fabricated wires or permanent magnets on ion surface traps  @xcite , with the purpose of performing quantum logic gates without lasers by magnetic coupling to the ions . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite magnetic field gradients of 2 - 20  t / m are reported which would make it possible to magnetically trap @xmath0rb atoms with trapping frequencies reaching 20  khz , 50  @xmath3 m above the trap surface .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we studied the tunneling dynamics of a single atom and a small bec in combination with a trapped ion . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the junction transmission can be controlled by the internal state of the ion making it possible to engineer large ion - matterwave entangled states . </S>",
    "<S> the system could be scaled up by considering josephson junctions coupled by strings of ions . </S>",
