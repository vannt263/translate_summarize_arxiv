    "the double - slit diffraction pattern of a micro - particle is a distinguishing point between classical mechanics ( cm ) and quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "the interference fringes of wave - particles are described within qm .",
    "this follows from an objective interpretation of the wave function and by the property that , in qm , superpositions of states are possible , while this is not so in cm @xcite .",
    "interference is resulted from the uncertainty principle between the momentum and the position of the quantum system .",
    "if we take the vacuum into account , it will require entanglement between complementary variables such as the momentum and the position or the angular momentum components @xcite .",

    "zecca in many studies investigated theoretically one , two and @xmath2-slit diffraction patterns for the gaussian wave packets @xcite .",
    "the use of gaussian states is sufficiently general , because it includes the limit case of plane waves and that of the wave packets narrower than the slit width .",
    "moreover , due to the development of experimental techniques , possible deviations from the standard form of the interference pattern can be better explained by gaussian - like states @xcite .    in this study , considering a macroscopic quantum oscillator interacting with two micro - oscillating particles in the environment , we exactly obtain the wave function of the system in the ground state as a gaussian wave packet .",

    "it is assumed that @xmath6 and @xmath5 dependences of the wave function remain factorized during and after passing the slits @xcite .",
    "we show that when quantum character of the macro - system is evanesced , interference fringes are diminished and the diffraction pattern becomes more similar to a classical one .",
    "the double - slit experiment is also a point where one can compare the predictions of qm with those of stochastic electrodynamics with spin ( seds ) .",
    "the comparison of the two theories was first studied in @xcite .",
    "the seds approach is based on electromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "our results show that there is a clear difference between the predictions of qm and those of seds for a macroscopic quantum system coupled to the environmental particles which depends on the quantum behaviour of the macro - system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we describe principles of the standard form of the schrdinger equation which is called dimensionless analysis . in section 3 , bilinear harmonic model of the environment is introduced .",
    "then , the ground state is exactly evaluated for the system coupled to two particles of the environment . in section 4 , the two- dimensional double - slit diffraction pattern is analyzed .",
    "two limiting cases of the problem are illustrated and discussed afterwards , to show how the emergence of classicality in the system leads to the appearance of macro - type fringes in the interference patterns . in section 5 , we analyze the double - slit interference pattern for macro - system based on seds and compare the results with qm .",

    "first , we introduce dimensionless parameters for an arbitrary quantum system . we define @xmath7 and @xmath8 as constant units of length and energy , respectively .",

    ", @xmath35 is too small compared to @xmath7 which the latter is nearly a fixed value for known models of potential .",

    "the macro - system shows more classical trait .",
    "one can also define @xmath37 in relation with the @xmath38 aspect of a system in a resonance situation .",

    "we choose @xmath103 in ( 8) to reach the definite bound of @xmath30 for a quasi - classical system , as mentioned before .",

    "the system has a macroscopic quantum character due to the conditions elaborated in section 3 ( see relation ( 29 ) ) .",

    "we consider two different limiting situations :    \\1 ) we suppose that the wave packet reaching the slits is narrower than both the slits , i.e. , @xmath156    the above condition shows that @xmath140 is very large and @xmath157 . in this case , from ( 43 ) one can show that :    @xmath158 [ \\int _ { ( y_0+d')\\beta /\\sqrt{2}}^{(y_0+b'+d')\\beta /\\sqrt{2}}exp(-t^2)dt+\\int _ { ( y_0-d - b)\\beta /\\sqrt{2}}^{(y_0-d)\\beta /\\sqrt{2}}exp(-t^2)dt]^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this shows that @xmath159 is a gaussian - like distribution @xcite .",
    "thus , the situation described in this case corresponds to an incident wave packet which after the slits , essentially remains undisturbed in its configuration or is reflected toward the negative @xmath6-direction , according to whether the incoming y - probability distribution is centered with regard to one of the slits or not . in this case , the diffraction pattern , for any value of @xmath30 between @xmath160 has a gaussian form .",
    "no interference pattern is seen here , since the particle passes through one slit .",
    "the result is shown in fig.1 .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed that @xmath161 .",
    "\\2 ) now , we assume that the wave packet reaching the slits has very large uncertainty , depicted by the y - position probability distribution , i.e. , @xmath162 from ( 46 ) , it is evident that @xmath140 should be very small . by setting @xmath163 in ( 43 ) and neglecting the term @xmath164 against @xmath165 for large values of @xmath5 ( knows as far - field approximation ) ,",
    "the integral term can be obtained as : @xmath166 sin \\frac{by}{2\\bar ht}+exp[\\frac{iy}{\\bar ht}(d'+\\frac{b'}{2 } ) ] sin \\frac{b'y}{2\\bar ht}\\rbrace\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath167 , @xmath168 , from ( 43 ) and ( 47 ) one gets :    @xmath169 \\frac{sin^2(by / 2\\bar ht)}{(by/2\\bar ht)^2 } cos^2[\\frac{y}{\\bar ht } ( d+\\frac{b}{2})]\\ ] ]    as expected , this probability has a maximum at @xmath161",
    ". if the separation of the slits is of the order of the slit width @xmath170 , the factor containing the _ cosine _ will be practically negligible and the expression ( 48 ) essentially gives the elementary diffraction pattern of a plane wave passing through a single slit .",
    "if the separation of the slits is much greater than their width @xmath171 , the relation ( 48 ) represents a high - frequency pattern modulated by elementary diffraction fringes . in this latter case ,",
    "the resulting diffraction pattern is plotted in different situations with @xmath172 and @xmath173 . the case",
    "for which @xmath172 shows the quantum trait of the system and for @xmath173 , the pattern describes the classical behavior of the macro - system ( see fig.2 ) .",

    "in seds , the schrdinger equation is considered as a rough approximation for a stochastic process , which works well for the average of the trajectories of each state under some definite conditions ( for example , for electrons bound in atoms ) , but not for single trajectories which occurs for the scattering process .",
    "a similar restriction holds for the diffraction of a beam of the particles passing through the two slits .",
    "the diffraction is due to the standing waves of the zero point field ( zpf ) between the edges of the two slits that establishes itself across the clifts and depends on the classical spin motion with constant speed @xcite .",
    "as a particle approaches one slit , its precession frequency increases and when it is equal to one of the standing zpf waves between the two slits , it undergoes a transverse impulse from the zpf with the following @xmath5-component of velocity : @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the speed of light and @xmath177 is the angular velocity of the particle around the unit vector ( @xmath178 ) perpendicular to the plane of gyration orbit . the relation ( 49 ) is in dimensionless form .",
    "these random transversal impulses are maximum when @xmath177 coincides with a peak of the zpf spectrum inside the slits .",
    "notice that the transverse deviations should occur not only when the particle has equal probability to pass through either one or the other of the two slits , but also when it can pass through only one slit @xcite .    for the velocity vector , the deviation angle of the beam @xmath179",
    "is defined as @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the particle speed before and after crossing the slits . using ( 49 ) , one can obtain the following dimensionless relation @xmath182 where @xmath183 is dimensionless energy per normal modes of the zpf .",
    "the intensity of the deviated beam depends on the spatial density of modes allowed by the slits .",
    "the amplitudes of the zpf waves are spatially uniform in space and zero on the wall of the slits .",
    "consequently , the spatial fourier transform of the zpf amplitude is @xmath184dy=\\frac{sin(k_yb)}{k_yb}\\ ] ]    the corresponding spatial distribution of the energy modes allowed by the slits is proportional to @xmath185 ^ 2\\ ] ] which is familiar for zpf waves and is also equivalent with what can be obtained from ( 48 ) for a wide beam ( i.e. , @xmath186 ) @xcite .",
    "the intensity maxima occur for @xmath187    since @xmath188 , one can show that this corresponds to @xmath189    for a given @xmath190 , where @xmath190 is the distance of the particle from the nearest edge of the slit and @xmath191 , three maxima should appear : one for the central undeviated beam , and two others for two different points with opposite signs .",
    "this resembles the quantum prediction , specially when the open macro - system behaves more classically ( see fig.2 for @xmath173 ) .",
    "when the order of classicality is low ( e.g. , @xmath172 ) , the interference pattern has more details .",
    "yet , the interaction of the zpf waves with the incident beam does not depend on the size of the slits as well as the width of the incident beam itself .",
    "so , the diffraction pattern should appear again , if the beam is much narrower than the slit width ( i.e. , @xmath192 ) .",
    "this prediction is totally different with qm , because according to qm , no diffraction should occur in this condition ( see the relation ( 45 ) and fig.1 ) .",
    "therefore , the prediction of seds for a narrow beam of the particles with respect to the widths of the slits is that for each position of the entering beam , there are two angles of deviation given by ( 50 ) .",
    "the average intensity of the two deviated beams is given by ( 52 ) .",
    "clearly , there should be always a central , non - deviated beam . by displacing gradually the position of the entering beam and registering the successive pairs of the opposite spots",
    ", the complete diffraction pattern can be observed for a wide beam ( i.e. , @xmath186 ) , as mentioned before @xcite .",
    "we have drawn in fig.3 the deviation angle @xmath179 against the parameter @xmath30 and the widths of the slits @xmath121 .",
    "as is clear , when the angle @xmath179 decreases , along with an increase in the widths of the slits @xmath121 , the quantum nature of the macro - system is evanesced corresponding to smaller values of @xmath30 . in this situation",
    ", we expect that no interference occurs , but seds predict some fringes , as explained before . on the other hand , the same dependence of @xmath30 could not be observed for the narrow slits , since the deviation angle @xmath179 increases . in this cases ,",
    "seds predicts somehow an invariant interference pattern like for wide slits .",
    "nevertheless , as we see in fig.2 , for an open quantum system , the interference fringes could be variant , depending on the nature of the system ( illustrated by @xmath30 ) .",
    "this shows that there is a basic relationship between the quantum behaviour of the macro - system and the double - slit interference pattern predicted by seds .     on the parameter @xmath30 and the slits width @xmath121 for a macroscopic quantum system coupled to the environmental degrees of freedom . ]",
    "consequently , in the seds approach the interference fringes could be always present but with fixed patterns , since any particle passing through one of the two slits constantly feels the zpf waves due to the boundary conditions . in other words , the spatial waves of the zpf in ( 51 ) are always present between the two slits .",
    "interference patterns for different quantum systems have been considered for many decades . in recent years , however , the experts have encountered @xmath193 the quantum - to - classical transition occurrs when the system shows classical trait .",
    "taking into account the effects of an interacting environment on a quantum harmonic system via a simple oscillating model , we have shown that when the quantumness of the system is evanesced ( measured by the parameter @xmath30 in ( 29 ) ) , interference fringes are diminished in accordance with known patterns observed for macro - molecules ( see fig .",
    "2b ) @xcite .",
    "the environmental effects are not important when the incoming wave packet somehow describes the position state of the system in a given direction ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "so , we have now a controllable parameter @xmath30 by which we can follow and demonstrate the effects of the environment on quantum behavior of the system .",
    "this may open new door to the way one can better understand the emergence of classical appearance of the physical world in an interactive manner .",
    "moreover , we compared the double - slit interference patterns obtained by qm and seds for an open macroscopic quantum system .",
    "our results show that , contrary to what expected for closed systems , the diffraction pattern predicted by seds is not totally equal to the quantum case when the beam of particles is transversally uniform and much larger than the slit width @xmath121 . in the latter case ,",
    "the interference pattern shows different fringes for various value of @xmath30 .",
    "however , in the case of a beam that is narrow with respect to @xmath121 , the difference is more apparent , because in this situation too , the seds theory predicts an interference pattern , while in quantum approach we see no interference .",
    "these results show that there is a clear difference between the predictions of qm and those of seds for an open macroscopic quantum system .",

    "<S> in this study , we solve analytically the schrdinger equation for a macroscopic quantum oscillator as a central system coupled to two environmental micro - oscillating particles . </S>",
    "<S> then , the double - slit interference patterns are investigated in two limiting cases , considering the limits of uncertainty in the position probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we analyze the interference patterns based on a recent proposal called stochastic electrodynamics with spin . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that when the quantum character of the macro - system is decreased , the diffraction pattern becomes more similar to a classical one . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , depending on the size of the slits , the predictions of quantum approach could be apparently different with those of the aforementioned stochastic description .    </S>",
