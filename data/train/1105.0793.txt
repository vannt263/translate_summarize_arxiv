    "in recent years , the processes of population genetics , which describe the genetic structure of populations under the influence of evolutionary forces such as mutation , selection , recombination , migration , and genetic drift , have been a rich source of fascinating probabilistic problems .",
    "more precisely , the dynamics is often well understood in the limit of infinite population size , where a law of large numbers leads to a deterministic description ( in terms of discrete dynamical systems or differential equations ) , but great challenges ensue if the population is finite , in particular if there is interaction between individuals , such as competition ( selection ) or recombination ( the combination of genetic material of two parents into the ` mixed ' genetic type of an offspring ) ; see @xcite . interactions usually make the infinite - population model nonlinear and , often , already difficult enough to treat . in the corresponding stochastic model , they are reflected by transition rates ( or probabilities ) that depend nonlinearly on the current state of the system and often result in processes whose treatment provides enormous challenges . even the relationship between the stochastic process and its deterministic counterpart is usually unclear ( apart from the infinite population limit ) .",
    "in particular , the expectation of the stochastic process is , usually , not given by the corresponding deterministic dynamics - in general , such coincidence is reserved for populations of individuals that evolve independently ( as in branching processes ) ; or systems with interactions that do not change the expectation ( like wright - fisher sampling ) .    indeed ,",
    "even the analysis of the expectation is difficult in most processes of population genetics with interaction .",
    "its dynamics does , usually , not only depend on the current expectation , but on higher moments , whose change , in turn , depends on even higher moments . formulating",
    "this hierarchy of dependencies is a common approach for stochastic processes arising in various applications in physics , chemistry , and biology @xcite .",
    "usually , this hierarchy continues indefinitely ( it does not ` close ' ) ; to extract at least an approximation to the ( lower ) moments of interest , some method of ` moment closure ' must be employed ( in the simplest case , a truncation ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding deterministic systems ( that arise through a law of large numbers ) are also often tackled via systems of moments or cumulants , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "v.4 ) for an overview .",
    "models of recombination take a special role between linear and nonlinear models .",
    "although there is abundant interaction and hence nonlinearity , the deterministic system that describes the frequencies of all possible ( geno)types may be ( exactly ) transformed into a linear one by embedding it into a higher - dimensional space ( more explicitly , by adding further components that correspond to products of type frequencies ) .",
    "this method is known as haldane linearisation @xcite .",
    "the underlying linear structure even allows a diagonalisation and explicit solution , see @xcite and references therein . in certain important special cases ( notably , in so - called single - crossover dynamics in continuous time ) , this solution is surprisingly simple and immediately plausible @xcite .    elucidating underlying linear structures in the corresponding stochastic system ( more precisely , in the moran model with recombination )",
    "has only started very recently . in the aforementioned single - crossover case , bobrowski et al .",
    "@xcite analysed the asymptotic behaviour in the presence of mutation .",
    "baake and herms @xcite observed that the expected type frequencies in the finite system ( but without genetic drift ) follow those in the deterministic model ; this could be explained by the ( conditional ) independence of certain marginalised processes that appear as ` subsystems ' of the stochastic model .",
    "this and other results now lead to the question whether in the general recombination scheme ( i.e. , not restricted to single crossovers ) the dynamics of the expectations may be embedded into a higher but finite dimensional space , such that they are given by a finite system of differential equations ?",
    "is there an equivalent of haldane linearisation in the sense of moments ?",
    "this article will address these questions in the framework of the moran model with recombination and mutation .",
    "in particular it will show that the system of moments closes here after a finite number of steps , without any need for approximations , as long as there is no genetic drift .",
    "this may be considered as a stochastic analogue of haldane linearisation .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath0 individuals .",
    "each of them is endowed with the set @xmath1 of sites .",
    "these can be interpreted as nucleotide positions in a string of dna or as gene loci on a chromosome .",
    "for each site @xmath2 there is a finite set @xmath3 of alleles that may occur at site @xmath2 . a string of alleles",
    "is then called a type , @xmath4 is the type space .",
    "we are interested in modelling recombination , which means the rearrangement of genetic material in sexually reproducing populations .",
    "it may occur during meiosis , the creation of gametes , that is egg cells or sperm .",
    "homologous chromosomes may cross over at some points and exchange the genetic material in between ( see figure [ rekoschema ] ) .        in the following",
    "we will assign recombination events to subsets of sites in a natural way .",
    "let @xmath5 .",
    "then the corresponding recombination event between two individuals is the following : the alleles at the sites given by @xmath6 remain at their positions , whereas the alleles at the sites in @xmath7 , the complement of @xmath6 , are exchanged ( see figure [ sites_reco ] ) .",
    "( circled sites ) ]    we define the mappings @xmath8 , @xmath5 by @xmath9 where @xmath10 means that the coordinates are ordered as in @xmath11 .",
    "so , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the new types resulting from the recombination event corresponding to @xmath6 between the types @xmath14 and @xmath15 . obviously , @xmath16",
    "so , @xmath6 and @xmath7 essentially correspond to the same recombination event .",
    "we now define a moran model with recombination and mutation .",
    "each individual undergoes recombination events corresponding to @xmath5 at rate @xmath17 for all @xmath5 .",
    "the recombination partner is chosen out of the whole population ( including the opening individual itself )",
    ". then they exchange their genetic material according to the recombination event corresponding to @xmath6 ( see figure [ moranmodel ] ) .",
    "the second individual , which is of type @xmath14 , undergoes a recombination event corresponding to @xmath6 and chooses its partner randomly , here the fourth individual , which is of type @xmath15 ; from that time on , the individuals are of type @xmath12 and @xmath13 . ]    to keep things well - defined , the recombination rates @xmath18 have the properties @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , mutation events may occur .",
    "an allele @xmath21 at site @xmath2 mutates into allele @xmath22 with rate @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the mutation rate depends on both the parental and the offspring allele .",
    "additionally , we introduce birth events or , more precisely , resampling .",
    "each individual produces an offspring at rate @xmath24 .",
    "the offspring inherits the parent s type and replaces another individual , randomly chosen from the entire population ( again including the parent individual ) .    in the following we are interested in the composition of the population ,",
    "so we define the stochastic process @xmath25 with state space @xmath26 , by @xmath27 in the following we will use shorthands like @xmath28 , @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "recombination , mutation and resampling events induce the following transitions if @xmath32 :    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    the rate in is determined in the following way : an individual of type @xmath14 recombines at rate @xmath36 and chooses one individual of type @xmath15 with probability @xmath37 .",
    "this leads to the rate @xmath38 which needs to be multiplied by @xmath39 to account for the fact that the recombination could be initiated by an individual of type @xmath15 and that recombination according to @xmath6 is the same as recombination according to @xmath7 .",
    "a brief comment on the model is in order .",
    "we consider recombination and reproduction as independent events whereas , in true biology , recombination is coupled to reproduction .",
    "we use the decoupled version here because it is simpler , and because it allows to clearly separate the effects of random recombination from those of random reproduction .",
    "this version is also used elsewhere @xcite , on the argument that recombination events are rare .",
    "for a subset @xmath5 we define @xmath40 and the mapping @xmath41 as the canonical projection .",
    "let @xmath42 be a ( signed ) measure on @xmath11 .",
    "we define the pullback @xmath43 by @xmath44 .",
    "so , @xmath43 maps a measure on @xmath11 onto its corresponding marginal measure on @xmath45 .    in the following , marginal processes of @xmath46 will play a crucial role .",
    "the following proposition states that these are markov chains , too .",
    "it is an extension of lemma 1 in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath47 , and let @xmath25 be the recombination process as defined by equations - .",
    "then @xmath48 is a markov process with state space @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "obviously , @xmath51 is a stochastic process on @xmath52 .",
    "we must show that the transition rates of @xmath53 only depend on the current state of the process .",
    "a recombination event induces the following transition : @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 in line with .",
    "consider now any nonzero jump .",
    "if it comes from a recombination event , it must be of the form .",
    "that means there are types @xmath57 and a subset @xmath58 of @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 both decrease by one and the frequencies of the marginal types arising in the recombination event corresponding to @xmath58 increase .",
    "the rate for this transition is then given by the sum of all transitions of the original process that induce this transition in the marginal process : @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "so , this last term depends only on the current state of the marginal process @xmath53 .",
    "a mutation event of an individual of type @xmath14 at site @xmath2 from allele @xmath64 to allele @xmath65 induces the following transition of @xmath66 : @xmath67 this jump is zero if @xmath68 . obviously , the transition rate is @xmath69 and depends merely on the current state of @xmath66 , too .",
    "the case of resampling is treated analogously .",
    "this proof is an example for the so - called lumping procedure for markov chains , compare @xcite for the general context or @xcite for the sequence context considered here .",
    "[ subsyst ] a comparison between and shows that the marginal process @xmath53 can itself be considered as a recombination process on the sites @xmath59 .",
    "so , assertions about @xmath46 will also hold for all derived marginal processes .",
    "in this section we restrict ourselves to the case _ without mutation and resampling _ , that means with @xmath70 for all @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 for some @xmath74 , there are ` empty ' recombination events at positive rate , but including these redundancies makes the rates in so simple .",
    "the rates become considerably more complicated if only ` true jumps ' are considered .",
    "this is already visible in the projection onto a single type .",
    "let @xmath75 and @xmath32 . in order to figure out the rate for the transition @xmath76",
    ", we first determine the set of all pairs of types @xmath77 such that for a given @xmath5 the jump @xmath78 equals @xmath79 : @xmath80 this leads to the transition rate @xmath81\\big[\\big(\\pi^{}_{\\bar g}.z\\big)\\big(\\pi^{}_{\\bar g}(x)\\big)-z(x)\\big].\\ ] ] the transition rate for @xmath82 can be figured out analogously ; @xmath83 iff @xmath84 and @xmath85 is any type which is neither in @xmath86 nor in @xmath87 .",
    "since @xmath88 one has the rate @xmath89.\\ ] ] our aim is now to reformulate the process with the help of additional random variables , so that the transition rates become simpler , in particular , unaffected by empty events . to this end , we define two new counting measures derived from @xmath25 , namely @xmath90 by @xmath91 and @xmath92 and @xmath93 by @xmath94 and @xmath95 these processes also count events at which @xmath46 does not change , namely the case that individuals of type @xmath14 are created and broken up at the same time .",
    "this may happen when an individual of type @xmath14 recombines according to @xmath6 with an individual of type @xmath15 with @xmath96 .",
    "whenever this occurs , both counters increase but their difference remains unchanged .",
    "altogether , we thus have @xmath97 with the transition rates of @xmath98 and @xmath99 unaffected by ` empty ' events : for @xmath100 , @xmath101 happens at rate @xmath102 and for @xmath103 , the transition @xmath104 happens at rate @xmath105    in the following , marginal processes will emerge frequently .",
    "we introduce a short - hand , symbolic notation similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "fix an arbitrary @xmath75 and define for a subset @xmath106 of sites @xmath107_t:=[g^{}_1,\\dots , g^{}_{|g|}]_t:=\\big(\\pi^{}_g.z_t\\big)\\big(\\pi^{}_g(x)\\big).\\ ] ] @xmath108_t$ ] is the number of individuals that are identical to @xmath14 at the sites corresponding to @xmath6 , at time @xmath109 .",

    "analogously , we define for the processes @xmath98 and @xmath99 : @xmath112    @xmath113    by remark [ subsyst ] , we can now consider @xmath108_t$ ] as a recombination process on @xmath114 sites evaluated at the type @xmath115 .    for @xmath116",
    ", the distribution of @xmath117 can be given explicitly because the transition rates @xmath118_t[g^{}_2]_t=:a\\ ] ] are constant in time because all 1-site marginals are constant in time .",
    "so , @xmath117 follows a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath119 .",
    "since we will use it frequently , we want to recall an elementary fact concerning the dynamics of the mean of a continuous - time markov chain with a finite state space , which is often used implicitly .",
    "the proof is a straightforward exercise that can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fact 1 ) , for example .",

    "second , a single crossover recombination event only affects one of the induced processes while leaving the other one constant .    with general recombination both these properties",
    "are violated .",
    "first , marginal processes arise that are given by _",
    "non - ordered _ partitions , so even single - crossover recombination events may affect both processes at the same instant .",
    "second , a multiple - crossover recombination event may affect the frequency of a pair of marginals that are given by an ordered partition .",

    "on the right - hand side , an expectation of products emerges .",
    "this is what one may expect due to the inherent nonlinearity of the recombination process .",
    "nevertheless , we see that no site arises more than once , so the arising products are described by a partition of sites .",
    "this leads us to the following question : given an arbitrary partition of sites , what is the dynamics of the mean of the product of the induced marginal processes ?",
    "theorem [ zentral ] below answers this . for its formulation",
    "we need the following definition .",
    "let @xmath138 be a collection of sets with @xmath139 .",
    "define @xmath140 .",

    "similarly , in the recombination event corresponding to @xmath6 between individuals of marginal types @xmath150 and @xmath151 for @xmath152 , the processes @xmath153 increase .    with these preparations , we are now ready to state    [ zentral ]    let @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 be a partition of @xmath157 . define @xmath158 as the set of all triples @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is a partition of @xmath161 .",
