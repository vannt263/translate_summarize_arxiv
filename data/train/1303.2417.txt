    "we call @xmath8 as the dcg error . specially , @xmath9 for the bipartite ranking .",
    "it is worth noticing that the above ndcg is different from the classical ndcg for the query - dependent ranking , where the dcg function is ( for the single query ) : @xmath10    consider the case of the query - dependent ranking with @xmath11 ratings . for the given query",

    "the increment due to the variation in the position @xmath51 will be @xmath53 because there are @xmath54 positive instances in the first @xmath33 positions and @xmath55 positive instances in the remain @xmath22 instances . as for the position @xmath52 , the increment should be @xmath56 since there are @xmath57 negative instances in the remain @xmath22 instances before @xmath52 . in summary",
