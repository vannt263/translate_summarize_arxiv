    "despite a long history of the solar magnetic field studies and enormous number of publications , many problems remain unsolved .",
    "one of these problems concerns solar small - scale magnetic fields in the photosphere outside sunspots .",
    "the determination of the fine structure of magnetic elements is difficult because of their very weak magnetic flux and insufficient resolution .",
    "present - day spectropolarimetric observations of absorption lines which provide basic information about the magnetic field structure have a spatial resolution not better than a few tenths of arcsec .",
    "to resolve separate small magnetic features in the photosphere and to obtain information about their properties and structure , we need a resolution better than @xmath13.1 .",
    "it is found that the small - scale magnetic elements should be smaller than 50 - 100  km @xcite .",
    "furthermore , have shown that any magnetic element should be structured down to the turbulent magnetic diffusivity length - scales of 10  km .",
    "such small structures can not be resolved with the present - day telescopes .",
    "but it is possible to improve our understanding of the nature of solar small - scale fields with the use of the self - consistent models of solar photosphere regions .",
    "these models are constructed on the basis of realistic physics with the use of the equations of radiation magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "such time - dependent mhd models allow us to study in detail the evolution , dynamics , and structure of magnetic elements .",
    "the spatial resolution of the numerical simulation is a few grid points corresponding to a few tens of kilometers @xcite .",
    "a detailed review of realistic mhd simulations of solar magnetoconvection can be found in and .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) models of the solar magnetoconvection were first considered in the pioneering work of .",
    "later has studied the local dynamo mechanism using idealized 3d simulation of thermal magnetoconvection in the boussinesq approximation in the quiet photosphere .",
    "realistic 3d mhd models were further developed in @xcite , ( @xcite ) ; ; ; .",
    "the 3d mhd simulation are complemented by two - dimensional ( 2d ) mhd simulation ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; @xcite , @xcite ; ; ) .",
    "the analysis of 2d simulations of convection @xcite showed that 2d models reproduce many features of 3d convection , although can not represent realistic flow patterns @xcite . however , 2d mhd models quite adequately reproduce small - scale phenomena and are useful in studying the properties of magnetic elements ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) .",
    "the 2d mhd models by first presented the evolution of magnetogranulation of mixed - polarity solar regions over 2 hours of solar time .",
    "based on these models have considered formation and destruction of fluxtubes and have obtained the observable signatures of convective collapse in stokes - v profiles .",
    "these signatures were confirmed by spectropolarimetric observations of and .",
    "a clear relation was found between field strength and magnetic inclination @xcite .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "it was found that the predominantly horizontal weak fields are located in the photospheric layers of granules @xcite .",
    "this fact was confirmed by new hinode observations @xcite .",
    "an example of flux recycling events in this simulation was discovered by .",
    "later , 3d  mhd simulation by confirmed that a local short - period recirculation can arise near the surface under the conditions of strong stratification and asymmetric convective flows .",
    "this mechanism can provide a high rate of flux emergence through the solar surface .",
    "the 2d mhd models @xcite were also used in the stokes diagnostics of small - scale magnetic fields ( @xcite , @xcite ; ; ) . in this paper a stokes diagnostics of simulated 2d magnetogranulation with two different magnetic flux densities is presented .    as to the terminology , the term `` magnetogranulation '' means granulation in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "the compact magnetic elements are similar to sheet - like structures extending along the lanes ( `` fluxsheets '' ) in the 2d cartesian description .",
    "we use for them the traditional definition `` fluxtubes '' . to avoid confusion in defining the magnetic field characteristics we use the following : @xmath14 is the magnitude of the magnetic vector , i.e.",
    ", the field strength ; @xmath15 is the average field strength over given region ; @xmath16 is the vertical component of the magnetic vector ; @xmath17 is the unsigned ( absolute ) flux density ; @xmath18 is the flux density .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath19 is the area integral over the field vector when the line of sight is perpendicular to the area of integration , i.e. , it is the longitudinal magnetic flux .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : section 2 shortly describes the 2d mhd simulations used in our analysis .",
    "the spectral synthesis of stokes profiles is considered in section 3 .",
    "the results of stokes diagnostics are presented in section 4 , and section 5 gives our conclusions .",
    "the complete system of radiative magnetohydrodynamical equations is used for the 2d mhd simulation of the upper solar convection zone and the photosphere @xcite .",
    "we adopt the approximation that the medium is compressible , partially ionized , stratified by gravity , and coupled with the radiation .",
    "the simulations start with a 2d hydrodynamical ( hd ) model of the solar granulation obtained earlier by .",
    "the code for the integration of the mhd equations represents an extension of the radiation - hydrodynamic code that is described in detail by .",
    "note that the radiative transfer is treated in the grey approximation .",
    "the magnetic field is described by the vector potential , so that the divergence of magnetic field strength is always zero in the simulated region .    in the first simulation the computational domain spans 3920  km horizontally and 1820  km vertically , with the grid step of 35  km corresponding to @xmath2052 grid - points .",
    "the atmosphere is extended from 1135  km below to 685  km above the geometrical height @xmath21 or @xmath22 , @xmath23 being the rosseland optical depth ( figure  [ init_16]a ) .",
    "this simulation ran for 2 hours of the solar time .    in the second simulation the grid size of the computational domain is @xmath24 grid - points ( or @xmath25  km , figure  [ init_16]b ) .",
    "the corresponding grid step is 25  km .",
    "the atmosphere covers 900  km below and 700  km above the level @xmath21 .",
    "the total simulation time is 4.5  hours .",
    "the side boundaries are periodic while the upper and lower boundaries are open .",
    "we adopt @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the upper and lower boundaries , where @xmath28 is the horizontal component of the magnetic field .",
    "the configuration of the initial magnetic field is bipolar ( figure  [ init_16 ] ) .",
    "the total initial field flux over the computational box is zero .",
    "the mean initial magnetic field strength @xmath15 over the entire computational domain in the first and second simulations is 54 and 1.6  g. processing and amplification of the initial field is resulted in additional magnetic unsigned flux , which is varied with time .",
    "the mechanisms of the magnetic field growth were considered by .",
    "the initial mhd model includes the initial magnetic field superposed on the hd model of solar granulation .",
    "a transient of the order of 30 min is needed for the magnetic field to be consistent with the hd structure . in general , the simulation may be arbitrarily divided into three stages .",
    "figure  [ m_54 ] shows the evolution of the brightness , of the vertical velocity , and of the vertical magnetic field in the first simulation at @xmath22 . the initial period ( 020 min )",
    "is determined mainly by the initial conditions : the field lines are forced out by convective motions to the region of downflows .",
    "the field lines are partially reconnected and the local field concentrations are dissipated . in the period ,",
    "@xmath2930  min , no clearly - defined features of the magnetic field is present .",
    "this can be seen from the @xmath16-distribution ( figure  [ m_54]c ) .",
    "therefore the magnetic field has a chaotic ( turbulent ) distribution up to @xmath30  min . later on the field",
    "becomes structured : it is enhanced in intergranular lanes ; new thin flux tubes begin to form at the moment of the granule fragmentation ; fields of different polarities are separated ; the field in strong flux tubes tends to be vertical , while it is more horizontal above granules .",
    "the structural changes of the magnetic field , the brightness field , and the vertical velocity field are similar in appearance .",
    "after @xmath31  min the bright points appear within the intergranular lanes ( figure  [ m_54]a ) corresponding to the regions with compact strong predominantly vertically orientated magnetic field ( figure  [ m_54]c ) and strong downfllows ( figure  [ m_54]b ) .",

    "we can use a sample of snapshots for stokes diagnostics .",
    "we select the 30  min sample of snapshots in the @xmath33120  min interval marked by dashed lines in figure  [ m_54 ] .",
    "it contains 56 snapshots .",
    "four of them are taken at @xmath3393.5  min every 1  min , whereas the timestep of the rest is 30 sec .",

    "the large difference between @xmath15 and @xmath17 can be explained by the presence of the relatively weak almost horizontally oriented fields which fill the granular surface . the 30 min sample of snapshots with absolute flux density of 300  g will be called hereafter 300-mhd .",
    "but for the second mhd simulation . dashed lines mark the selected region for stokes diagnostics with absolute flux density of 140  g at @xmath35 ( 140-mhd ) . , scaledwidth=97.0% ]    the spatial - temporal evolution of the simulated magnetogranulation in the second simulation with the initial @xmath36  g is shown in figure  [ m_16 ] .",
    "the bps are not seen in the continuum at @xmath37  nm ( figure  [ m_16]a ) .",
    "according to the simulation only weak - field fluxtubes are formed .",
    "it is believed that the bps are caused by lateral radiation leakage scattering from deeper layers of the magnetic element .",
    "the magnetic field of the weak - field fluxtubes is not strong enough for their evacuation in their low photosphere levels .",
    "we assume that such conditions can occur in the solar photosphere too .",
    "a detailed study of observed bps can be found in , , and .",
    "these authors find that bps are common in the quiet sun .",
    "according to observations of g - band bps @xcite their density is 0.3  mm@xmath38 while found lower density , 0.020.05  mm@xmath38 .",
    "in addition , there are many bps with an intensity smaller than that of the mean photosphere @xcite .",
    "the bps deficiency in our second simulation contradicts the observations in this respect .",
    "60 snapshots are taken from second simulation in the range from 90 to 120  min ( marked on figure  [ m_16 ] ) .",
    "@xmath16 is varied from @xmath39 to 1300  g. the mean unsigned field strength @xmath15 for this sample is 252  g at the optical depth @xmath32 .",
    "the unsigned magnetic flux density @xmath17 is 140  g. this sample of 60 snapshots called 140-mhd is used later in stokes diagnostics .",
    "the fe i @xmath40 1564.8 nm line is the most zeeman - sensitive spectral line in the solar spectrum because of its largest stokes - v peak separation .",
    "this separation is unhampered by thermal line broadening effects , so that the field strength measurement becomes basically model independent if the magnetic field were constant .",
    "therefore one can directly determine the field strength from v - peak separations without the use of atmospheric models .",
    "a limitation of this method is that this line is weakened in kg magnetic concentrations more than other typical lines @xcite . to verify a diagnostic potential of this line we compare @xmath14 derived from v - peak separations of the synthetic profiles and original @xmath14 taken from the results of simulations .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement between them for @xmath41  g. as to observations , infrared polarimetry allows to measure the @xmath42 signals which are above the noise level of 0.00020.0003 in units of continuum intensity @xmath43 ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "this precision is sufficient to recover strong fields in observations with high spatial resolution ( @xmath44 and better ) .",
    "note that fe i 1564.8 nm line is formed under the lte conditions and its temperature sensitivity is low ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "it is often used in polarimetric measurements ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ) as well as for the analysis of mhd simulation ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ) .    for our calculation",
    "we use the same line parameters as that in the recent paper by .",
    "we adopt the excitation potential of 5.43  ev , the oscillator strength of @xmath45 , and the iron abundance of @xmath46  7.43 .",
    "collisional broadening by neutral atoms is calculated following .",
    "we do not take into account any micro- and macro - turbulent velocities .",
    "the line profiles are computed with a spectral resolution of 5  m  in the wavelength range @xmath47    around the line center for four stokes parameters at the solar disc center in every vertical column along the line - of - sight of every snapshot .",
    "the solution of the unno - rachkovskii equations for the polarized light is obtained by a fifth - order runge - kutta - felberg method .",
    "we use our spansat code @xcite modified for the calculation of stokes profiles . as a result",
    "we obtain 6272 stokes - v profiles from the 300-mhd run and 12  120 from the 140 mhd run .",
    "these two samples of synthetic v profiles are used for stokes diagnostics of simulated regions with different unsigned flux densities .",
    "note that the observed stokes - v profiles are strongly affected by noise .",
    "therefore , when deriving the properties of the synthetic line profiles the noise should be considered too . in our special case",
    "the minimum of the mean amplitude of synthetic stokes - v signals is @xmath48 ( a maximum is 0.15 ) , while the noise level of stokes - v observations is lower ( 0.00020.0003 , ; 0.0005 , ) .",
    "it follows that we need not to take into account noise in the analysis of the synthetic stokes - v profiles .    together with the stokes profiles we calculate the contribution and response functions described by .",
    "we find that the effective formation depths of four stokes profiles differ slightly from each other .",
    "previously they were studied in detail by . the mean level of the effective absorption in the photosphere for the stokes - v peaks of the 1564.8  nm line changes from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , depending on their formation place .",
    "@xmath51 is the optical depth at @xmath40  500  nm .    in order to show how the simulated line profiles agree with observations , we show in figure  [ prof_15 ] the spatially averaged synthetic stokes - i profile and the observed spectrum of the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "the mean synthetic stokes - i profile is calculated using 12 snapshots with very weak magnetic fields .",
    "the snapshots are taken from the 140-mhd run in 0.5 min in the range from 90  min to 96.5  min .",
    "the number of snapshots is optimized to exclude the effect of the 5  min oscillations .",
    "the average synthetic and observed profiles agree satisfactorily .",
    "we also reduce the spatial resolution of the computed stokes profiles to the observed spatial resolution . for this",
    "we perform a convolution of the synthetic stokes profiles with the point - spread function ( psf , ) .",
    "the psf represents a combination of an airy function appropriate for the german vtt and a lorentz function describing the image degradation caused by seeing .",
    "the psf involves a 2-dimensional convolution with the synthetic signals in the plane perpendicular to the los . in the case of our 2d mhd simulation",
    "we have @xmath42 profiles which change only along one spatial @xmath52-coordinate perpendicular to the los .",
    "we assume that the profiles along the @xmath53-coordinate perpendicular to the los is identical to that of @xmath52-coordinate .",
    "thus each computed stokes profile is individually convolved with the psf to be smeared in the plane perpendicular to the los .",
    "the free coefficients of the psf are selected so that the continuum contrast at @xmath40  1564.8  nm after smoothing matches the observed contrast of 3% @xcite .",
    "based on this contrast agreement we assume that the resolution of the smoothed images of magnetogranulation is close to the observed resolution of about @xmath54 @xcite .    the synthetic rms contrast is about 8% before and about 3% after smoothing in the two simulated regions . figure  [ contrast ] shows the contrast distribution obtained before and after the spatial smoothing of the continuum intensity .",
    "note that the asymmetric shape of the contrast distribution is more pronounced for the simulated region with stronger average magnetic flux .",
    "after smoothing the stokes - v profiles change substantially .",
    "the seeing transforms the majority of the profiles to broader and weaker ones .",
    "the amplitudes of red ( @xmath55 ) and blue ( @xmath56 ) wings and their mean values , @xmath57 , decrease .",
    "the relative distribution of @xmath58 is shown in figure  [ ampl ] . on the average , the amplitudes of the synthetic stokes - v signals @xmath59% ( 3.6% ) before and 1.7% ( 1.5% ) after smoothing in the 300-mhd ( 140-mhd ) region .",
    "they are one order of magnitude larger than the observed @xmath60 in the internetwork regions (; ) and are closer to that observed in magnetic network regions .",
    "this fact as well as the larger absolute flux density in the simulated regions ( by a factor of 10 ) as compared to the quiet - sun observations implies that the simulated regions likely correspond to a network regions observed on the solar surface .    the number of stokes - v profiles with irregular shapes changes considerably after smoothing , specially in the case of 300-mhd .",
    "we call the @xmath42 profiles irregular if they have more than one zero - crossing",
    ". the fraction of irregular synthetic profiles for 300-mhd snapshots is 9% before and 58% after spatial smoothing . for 140-mhd snapshots it is 12% and 5% , respectively .",
    "the number of irregular stokes - v profiles increases after smoothing for 300-mhd , but it decreases for 140-mhd .",
    "why do the two simulations behave so differently ?",
    "since neighboring @xmath42 profiles influence each other in the act of smoothing , we considered the shape of many synthetic profiles in detail before and after smoothing .",
    "it turns out that magnitude and sign of amplitudes ( @xmath56 and @xmath55 ) and especially zero - crossing shifts differ dramatically from a profile to a profile in 300-mhd run .",
    "the reason is that the range of magnetic field strength and vertical velocities is considerably larger in the 300-mhd region than in the 140-mhd region .",
    "note that according to 34% of the analyzed observed ir profiles have irregular shape .",
    "the irregular v profiles can introduce additional errors in the evaluation of stokes - v peak separation , zero - crossing wavelength , area and amplitude asymmetry .",
    "therefore in our analysis only the v profiles with regular shape are used , i.e. , with a well - defined zero - crossing .",
    "how are magnetic fields distributed over the surface of the sun outside active centers ? this question is a hot topic in current research ( for reviews , see ; ) .",
    "the weak and strong magnetic fields are strongly mixed in the solar photosphere ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ) .",
    "the field lines are very tangled ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) .",
    "many attempts have been made to deduce distribution function of magnetic field on the solar surface .",
    "however , there is no agreement between the distribution functions obtained in different papers ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; @xcite , @xcite ; ) .",
    "if the magnetic field distribution on the solar surface is continuous in the range from 0 to 2000 g , the existing discrepancies can be explained by the following reasons : 1 ) visible and ir lines `` see '' different structures because of their different magnetic sensitivity @xcite ; 2 ) different techniques use simple or complex atmospheric models @xcite ; 3 ) spatial resolution of the observed stokes profiles and cancellation effects are different @xcite ; 4 )  the noise level in the measurements of very weak stokes - v signals is varied @xcite ; 5 ) the difference of the formation depth of different lines used in observations @xcite .",
    "besides , the variety of physical processes in different regions leads to different magnetic structures and different magnetic field distributions @xcite .",
    "realistic simulation of solar magnetoconvection (; ; ; ; ) has revealed that the magnetic fields in the photosphere are structured from the greatest to the smallest details and have mixed polarities at small scales .",
    "there are a few studies in which field strength distributions have been obtained from magnetoconvection simulations @xcite .",
    "we also use the 300-mhd and 140-mhd samples of snapshots from the 2d mhd simulation by to determine the magnetic field distribution .    the distribution of field strength on the solar surface is usually characterized by a probability density function , or shortly pdf , ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ; ; ) . according to the probability density function",
    "@xmath61 is defined by a probability distribution function , @xmath62 which gives the probability of finding a magnetic field strength less than @xmath14 at given location within the given field of view . where @xmath63 is the probability of a magnetic field strength to have at a given location a value in the interval @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath61 is always positive and normalized to unity @xmath65 its first moment , @xmath66 gives the mean value of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the second moment , @xmath67 provides the unsigned magnetic energy density @xmath68 . in our case",
    "@xmath61 is not continuous because we have a finite number of grid cells , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 values ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we can obtain a discrete pdf of magnetic field strength in each simulated region .",
    "for this purpose we divide whole range of the field strengths into equal bins of 50  g. each individual intrinsic field @xmath70 is assigned to one @xmath72th bin .",
    "the discrete pdf for the @xmath72th bin , @xmath73 $ ] , is defined as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the absolute frequency for the @xmath72th bin and @xmath76 is the interval of the bin .",
    "figure [ pdf_ful ] shows histograms of the discrete pdfs of signed magnetic field strengths in the two simulated regions .",
    "they show the statistical properties of different layers in the photosphere .",
    "the strongest magnetic fields beyond 1 kg are located near @xmath77 .",
    "they decrease with the height in the photosphere .    for comparison we can consider pdfs derived from 3d mhd simulation of magnetoconvection with different initial conditions for magnetic field ( , fig .  5 ; , fig .  5 )",
    "used a vertical , homogeneous , unipolar , initial field of 200  g. simulated with no initial magnetic field , but , lately horizontal magnetic fields were advected into the simulated domain by upflows across the lower boundary .",
    "our pdf ( figure  [ pdf_ful]a ) in shape more closely resembles the pdf by than the pdf by because the initial magnetic field of our simulation and of are similar in appearance .",
    "as the simulation of looks the emergence of magnetic flux through solar surface , the same is characteristic of our simulation .",
    "just as the field strength pdf is derived from stokes - v observations , we obtain the pdf for simulated region from the synthetic v profiles of the fe  i @xmath40  1564.8  nm line .",
    "we use the @xmath42 peak separations technique to determine @xmath70 in each simulated element of each snapshot .",
    "the inferred discrete pdfs of magnetic field strength in the simulated regions are called 15648-pdfs .",
    "they are normalized so that their integral is equal to 1 if all @xmath69 values of @xmath70 of a given sample are considered .",
    "if only some portion @xmath78 of all @xmath70 values is considered , the integral is equal to @xmath79 .",
    "such normalization assumes that remaining portions of the simulated region surface is field - free .",
    "it does not change the pdf s shape .",
    "figure  [ mhd - pdf ] ( a , b ) shows the 15648-pdfs based on the original ( violet ) and smoothed ( blue ) stokes - v profiles in the two simulated regions .",
    "the difference between them increases for large field strengths .",
    "the original ( smoothed ) 15648-pdfs derived from the two simulated regions have @xmath80 about 330  g ( 270  g ) and about 230  g ( 250  g ) , respectively .",
    "we can estimate the reliability of the @xmath42 peak separations technique comparing the pdfs derived from numerical simulation and from synthetic stokes - v profiles ( original and smoothed ) .",
    "it can be seen from figure  [ mhd - pdf ] ( c , d ) that the original 15648-pdfs and the mhd - pdfs derived from the simulations at @xmath81 are in close agreement in the range of field strengths above 500  g. we conclude that the v - peak separation method is reliable only for @xmath82  g. the number of fields obtained by this method in the range 0200  g is zero while it is overestimated in the interval 200500  g. as a result a maximum of the 15648-pdfs is shifted with respect to a maximum of the mhd - pdfs to stronger fields by 150  g.    unfortunately , we can not directly compare the 15648-pdfs or the mhd - pdfs with the pdfs of magnetic field strength    observed in the network regions . when computing an observed pdf the knowledge of individual filling factors for each analyzed pixel is necessary . since the filling factors are different for weak and strong fields , taking them into account can dramatically change both the shape of the observed pdf and the magnitude of probability density .",
    "for an example one can compare @xmath83 and true @xmath84 in figure  3 of .",
    "computation of the filling factors and comparison between pdfs derived by different techniques is not trivial task @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mhd - pdfs represent the distribution of the field strength of each grid cell of a specific simulated region bounded by the sizes of computation domain .",
    "let consider the shape of observed pdfs obtained by inversion techniques which derive both true field strengths and their filling factors .",
    "figure  3 in the paper of presents a histogram of relative occurrence ( which is proportional to the probability density function ) of absolute true field strength of magnetic network and of their halo .",
    "this histogram reveals two peaks around 300400  g ( the halo fields ) and 13001400  g ( the strong network elements ) . using the other inversion technique , found only a one maximum around kg fields in the same network regions that were analyzed by .",
    "the mhd - pdfs do not reveal clear bimodal shape .",
    "instead they have one very broad maximum around 200700  g for the 300-mhd run and 100400  g for the 140-nhd run .",
    "note the mhd - pdf ( 300-mhd ) in shape is reminiscent of that found in observed quiet regions by with a maximum around 300700  g and with a maximum about 350  g. the mhd - pdf ( 140-mhd ) is similar to the pdf derived by with a maximum close to 100  g. note , however , that in this comparison we are ignoring the large fraction of field free photosphere inferred from observations , which is not present in the simulations .",
    "observations show an unsigned flux density one order of magnitude smaller than our simulations .    figure  7 by compares the semiempirical reference pdf of the quiet sun with the pdfs derived from a 3d mhd simulation by .",

    "the unsigned flux in the 140-mhd and 300-mhd is closer to the unsigned flux in the 200  g simulation of plages by . on the other hand ,",
    "our two simulations of magnetogranulation show magnetic features on the surface level that are similar to elongated sheet - like structures observed along intergranular lanes .",
    "they resemble the solar magnetic network .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that the number of weak fields ( @xmath87  g ) in our mhd - pdfs is less than in the semiempirical reference pdf by obtained for the internetwork fields of the quiet sun .",
    "following , we calculate the fraction of simulated surface with @xmath88 , @xmath89 the fraction of unsigned magnetic field strength , @xmath90 and the fraction of energy @xmath91 we find that about 83% of the surface area in the simulated strong ( weak ) network is filled by the magnetic fields of 1001000  g ( 100500  g ) . the fields with @xmath2  g occupy 9.7% ( 0.3% ) of the surface area and contribute with 55.2% ( 0.6% ) of the magnetic energy .",

    "the imbalance is an important characteristic of the magnetic flux distribution since it shows the degree of mixture of positive and negative fluxes .",

    "according to , the flux imbalance for network regions varies from 0.02 to 0.95 depending on the observed region .      by analogy with the measurements of shifts of observed stokes - v , we measure the doppler shifts of the synthesized @xmath42 profiles of the fe i @xmath40 1564.8  nm line relative to the rest wavelength .",

    "similar to observations , the regions of the simulated surface with the contrast more than  1 are called granules and the rest of regions around the granules are called intergranular lanes .",
    "as figure  [ velos ] suggests , the upflow velocity within the granules of the 300-mhd ( 140-mhd ) run is as large as about @xmath120 , on the average .",
    "we confirm the observed granular blueshift of the stokes profiles . in the dark intergranular lanes , where fluxtubes are often located",
    ", an average downflow velocity is as large as about 2.5 ( 1.5 )  @xmath10 .",

    ", it should be noted that no significant systematic motions ( @xmath121  @xmath10 ) inside fluxtubes are detected in spectropolarimetric observations with spatial resolution worse than  @xmath54 ( _ e.g. _ , ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a predominance of downflows is found in observations with spatial resolution better than  @xmath54 . in particular , obtain a mean redshift of about 0.5  @xmath10 for magnetic structures of the network and the plages .",

    "in addition , also analyze realistic 3d magnetoconvective simulations and find downflows of 1.53.3  @xmath10 , i.e. , it is much stronger than observed .",
    "the reason is that there are strong horizontal gradients in the velocity field on the small scales at the periphery of fluxtubes .",
    "the observed redshifts are underestimated due to insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "our simulated downflows of 1.52.5  @xmath10 agree well with the results of and confirm the intergranular redshift effect in the network regions .",

    "figure  [ velos]k illustrates the downflows in the 140-mhd region are smaller than in the 300-mhd region . in general , the statistical dependencies confirm the tight connection of the velocity field with small - scale magnetic fields in the solar photosphere .",
    "besides , figure  [ velos ] ( b , f , j as well as d , h , l , p ) shows the velocity distribution and the statistical velocity dependencies obtained after spatial smoothing of stokes - v profiles .",

    "the larger the absolute flux density , the stronger the changes due to spatial smoothing . in particular , see the dependence of @xmath115  on  @xmath58 .    summarizing the results of our los velocity analysis",
    "it is necessary to point out that the mean los velocity is greater than zero within simulated strong network region with high value of unsigned flux density .",
    "this is a result dominated downflows which are appeared due to a formation of strong magnetic concentrations with @xmath123  g. the correlation between los velocities and the intensity contrast , and stokes - v amplitudes is in agreement with the physical properties of convective motions in the photosphere .",
    "the variations of these parameters reflect the changes of the velocity field , temperature , and magnetic field of the solar plasma due to interaction of solar granules and small - scale magnetic fields in the observed photosphere .",
    "granular flows and overshooting convection act to gather magnetic field lines and to redistribute magnetic flux on the solar surface .",
    "a fundamental property of the thermal convection in a stratified photosphere is the topological asymmetry between hot upflows and cool downflows . until the magnetic field remains to be frozen in the plasma , i.e.",
    ", until the field reaches the condition of equipartition , the magnetic flux is expelled from the granule interior to its boundaries , the intergranular lanes , and also the upper photospheric layers",
    ". the expulsion process may give rise to magnetic field strength up to 1000 g at the radiating layer level in the region of downflows @xmath124 .",
    "hence , downflows , strong magnetic field strength , and low temperature in the photosphere are related to each other .",
    "a similar statement is true for upflows , weak magnetic field strength , and high temperature .",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath42 profiles is an indicator of the dynamic processes in solar magnetized plasma . according to polarimetric observations ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ; ) , @xmath42 profiles in active and quiet regions on the sun are variable in shape .",
    "almost all of them are asymmetric due to gradients of the magnetic and velocity fields along and across the line of sight @xcite .",
    "depending on the shape complexity , the profiles are said to be regular ( two lobes of opposite signs ) and irregular ( three and more lobes or a single lobe ) .",
    "we use the definition of the amplitude ( @xmath125 ) and area ( @xmath126 ) asymmetry of .",
    "the amplitude and area asymmetry for the regular stokes - v is defined as :    @xmath127    where @xmath56 , @xmath55 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 are the amplitudes and areas of the blue and red wings .",
    "the asymmetry of observed regular stokes profiles has been studied by many authors ( _ e.g. _ , , ; ; ) .",
    "previous and new results show that outside sunspots at the disc center the majority of regular profiles have positive asymmetry of amplitudes and areas , i.e. , the blue wing is stronger than the red one ; the amplitude asymmetry is two times greater , on the average , than the asymmetry of areas .",
    "it was not clear for a long time why the amplitude asymmetry exceeds the area asymmetry .",
    "figures [ asym_54 ] and [ asym_16 ] ( a , c ) show the distribution of the amplitude and area asymmetries derived for the 300-mhd and 140-mhd regions .",
    "the mean asymmetry of synthetic v profiles in two simulated regions is very small : @xmath130% ( 0.3% ) and @xmath131% ( @xmath132% ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the character of the statistical dependencies of @xmath125 and @xmath126 on the continuum intensity differ in the range @xmath133 ( figures  [ asym_54]e and [ asym_16]g ) . if follows from the v profiles formed within intergranules which have mainly positive @xmath125 and negative @xmath126 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath125 and @xmath126 for these v profiles is more than for the profiles formed in the granules .",
    "the other statistical dependencies ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 on @xmath58 and @xmath115 ) do not show a clear tendency .",
    "spatial smoothing drastically affects amplitude asymmetry of v - stokes .",
    "the values of @xmath125 basically become positive and considerably larger for the majority of profiles .",
    "the dependence of @xmath125 on @xmath43/@xmath134@xmath43@xmath135 also varies significantly .",
    "large @xmath125 mostly occurs in the profiles formed in intergranular lanes , where the effect of spatial smoothing is the greatest . on the average , @xmath136% ( 8.5% ) and @xmath137% ( @xmath117% ) in the v - stokes synthesized with the 300-mhd ( 140-mhd ) run .",
    "the spatial smoothing is one of the main reasons of the large observed amplitude asymmetry .",
    "@xmath125 is more sensitive to the atmospheric effects than @xmath126 .",
    "this may explain why the observed amplitude asymmetry is by a factor of two greater than the area asymmetry .",
    "our results demonstrate that the asymmetry of synthetic profiles ( without smoothing ) is much smaller than that of smoothed ones .",
    "the asymmetry of irregular synthetic stokes - v profiles is analyzed in detail by .",
    "we use the realistic 2d mhd simulations of nonstationary magnetogranulation by , with initial bipolar magnetic field , and with mean unsigned field strength of 54  g and 1.6  g. two time sequences of snapshots with an absolute flux density of 300  g and 140  g are analyzed in detail .",
    "most likely , the simulations reproduce magnetic structures similar to the strong and the weak network observed on the solar surface .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : + 1 .",
    "based on the magnetic field strength probability density functions , pdfs , deduced from the two simulated regions , we find that the pdf shape depends on the initial conditions of the magnetic field , the absolute magnetic flux density in the given region , and height in the photosphere .",

    "a close correlation are found between los velocity and the granular contrast as well as the magnetic field strength .",
    "the amplitude and area asymmetries of synthetic stokes - v profiles do not exceed 1% , on the average .",

    "spatial averaging influences the amplitude asymmetry by a larger extent compared to the area asymmetry .",
