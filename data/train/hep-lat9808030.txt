    "the @xmath3 gauge system has been investigated using mean - field method @xcite , monte carlo simulations @xcite and exact solutions @xcite .",
    "the objective of these studies was to find the phase diagram from the action ( equation [ eq : action ] ) , and to classify the order of the phase transitions .",
    "the action of the @xmath0 gauge lattice can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the value of the link connecting the sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the value of site @xmath6 .",
    "the first sum is over all sets of four neighboring links ( * plaquettes ) and the second sum is over all nearest neighbor sites .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath8 can obtain the values @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the free energy is then @xmath11 with the partition function @xmath12 given by @xmath13 and n is the number of sites in the lattice . *    from the action eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) we look at two gauge invariant observables @xmath14 and @xmath15 define as @xmath16 where the averaging is over all sites and links of the lattice .",
    "the factors @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the ratios between the number of sites to the number of links and plaquettes in a four - dimensional lattice .    in this system ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 can be used as order parameters replacing the standard magnetization which is not gauge invariant .",
    "they are order parameters in the sense that they exhibit singularities of the bulk thermodynamics .",
    "however they lack the property of a magnetization in that they never vanish ( except at temperature zero ) or zero .",
    "the phase diagram is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1.eps ] .",
    "the three transition lines experienced by @xmath14 and @xmath15 meet at the * triple point(a ) and split the phase space into three regions .",
    "this phase space includes two familiar limits . in the limit @xmath19 all plaquettes are forced to one .",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom therefore disappear and the system reduces to that of a normal four - dimension ising model . here",
    "@xmath14 experiences a second order transition while @xmath15 remains smooth .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the second order line is of ising type all the way to the triple point . *    on the @xmath20 axis the action reduces to a pure gauge theory and @xmath15 experiences a first order transition .",
    "this behavior continues all the way up to the triple point a with @xmath14 remaining smooth @xcite .",
    "a line of first order in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 is then formed which ends with the critical point c.",
    "we implemented a standard monte carlo procedure using a heat bath algorithm to generate the configurations of the lattice . in this paper",
    "we shall use the term * iterationto represent an update of all links and sites in the lattice . *    even using this method , the simulations require significant computational resources restricting us to modest lattice sizes for our investigation .",
    "therefore we used lattice sizes ranging from @xmath21 sites ( which other studies have shown to give good results @xcite ) up to @xmath22 , and at the critical point up to @xmath23 . in order to minimize surface effects",
    "a toroidal geometry was adopted .",
    "each simulation consisted of measurements of the observables along a line of points in the phase diagram .",
    "many such lines were made in order to cover the parameter space and measure variations along different directions . at each point",
    "the system was allowed to evolve for at least 10,000 iterations , with mean values of the observables calculated after discarding the first 1000 . in the vicinity of the critical point ,",
    "the relaxation time and fluctuations increased dramatically requiring more iterations to give reliable results . in this region",
    "we generated up to 100,000 iterations .",
    "along the first order line @xmath24 , the behavior of @xmath14 is like a magnetization with two metastable states @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , unlike the ising model , these two states are not symmetrical about the origin . by evaluating the mid point @xmath27 between @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ". we can consider @xmath28 which is then symmetrical about zero .",
    "however @xmath27 can only be found along the line of first order where there are two stable states present .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath14 are further complicated by tunneling between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this has the effect of blurring the first order nature of the transition making measurements of @xmath27 difficult . in order to reduce the effects of tunneling we work with @xmath29 . due to fluctuations in @xmath14",
    ", @xmath30 will never reduce to zero even though @xmath31 may become zero , however these fluctuations decrease as the lattice size increases .    in order to measure the critical exponents ,",
    "the relevant parameterization of the phase space must be identified .",
    "we therefore require an expression for the temperature @xmath32 and external field @xmath33 like directions in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in a magnetic system",
    ", a coexistence line occurs along the temperature axis .",
    "we therefore define the temperature axis @xmath32 for this system along the line of first order @xmath24 .    along this line",
    "the reduced temperature @xmath36 is given by @xmath37    the definition of the external field @xmath33 is less clear as there is no obvious preferred direction . in this work we used the definition used by brzin and drouffe @xcite in their mean field analysis of the critical exponents .",
    "the measurements of the critical exponents were carried out in two stages .",
    "firstly we made a direct fit for l to the exponents .",
    "this method was applied for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "next we used finite size scaling @xcite which gave more reliable measurements of @xmath38 and @xmath39 and also provided a value for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig : beta1.eps ] shows how @xmath30 changes with @xmath36 for the different lattices . after discarding points with small t ( where @xmath42 differs significantly from @xmath31 ) , the best fit gives @xmath43 .",
    "the solid line is the ising value of @xmath44 .",
    "a more accurate measurement of @xmath38 was obtained from finite size scaling .",
    "figure [ fig : paper3.eps ] shows these results and compares the data with simulations run in the ising limit , @xmath45 ( solid line ) .",
    "the values for the critical exponents used in this graph are those of a four dimensional ising model , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "deviation from a single curve was observed if @xmath40 or @xmath38 were varied by more that 0.02 .",
    "direct fits with @xmath41 were unreliable and depended strongly on the dimensions of the lattices we used .",
    "results from finite size scaling proved to be much more consistent as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paper4.eps ] . using the value of @xmath48 found",
    "earlier gives @xmath49 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath39 is less straight forward .",
    "it proved to be sensitive both to the location of the critical point and to the lattice size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : paper6.eps ] ) .",
    "the main difficulty arises from the fact that @xmath14 is not symmetric under the operation @xmath50 generating different values either side of the temperature axis are @xmath510.4 for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "measurements of lattices with different sizes showed , that the shape of @xmath14 vs.@xmath33 becomes more symmetric as the lattice size increases .",
    "the calculation of the range of @xmath39 values took place separately for each side around the zero of @xmath14 .",
    "the combined result is @xmath551.1 .",
    "the asymmetry also affects finite size scaling .",
    "it proved impossible to collapse both @xmath52 and @xmath54 data onto a single curve simultaneously as shown in fig [ fig : paper5.eps ] .",
    "treating each side independently gave @xmath48 and @xmath56 and @xmath48 and @xmath57 .",
    "the measured values of the critical exponents show that the critical point in this model most likely behaves like a four - dimensional ising model .",
    "the values of @xmath38 and @xmath40 fit the ising values with very high accuracy , @xmath41 has the ising value too , but the measurement is less accurate .    the only critical exponent that could be significant different from the ising value is @xmath39 .",
    "we ascribe our difficulties in measuring @xmath39 to our definition of the external field direction @xmath58 .",
    "it is not obvious from the model which direction is relevant and we were unable to isolate it from our data .",
    "the direction we adopted may therefore be a combination of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , thus our @xmath39 measurement is probably contaminated with effects from @xmath38 .",
    "this work is a numerically investigation of the behavior of the critical point in the @xmath0 gauge lattice .",
    "the critical exponents were measured using monte carlo simulations , and were calculated directly as well as through finite size scaling .",
    "other measurements were made in the ising limit of the system .",
    "the calculated exponents had the four - dimensional ising model values .",
    "the numerical measurements gave the same values as the theoretically calculated exponents of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "two other critical exponents , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , that were measured , gave also the ising values . the finite size scaling for @xmath38 created the same shape of curve as the one obtained from ising data .",
    "the present high precision runs set a high precision standard for the estimation of the character of other interesting critical points , notably the vortex / monopole condensation points in mixed action gauge theories and analogue points in supersymmetric theories .",
    "we would like to thank professor g. parisi for the helpful discussions .",
