    "superconductivity ( sc ) discovered in 1911 by kamerlingh onnes@xcite and his assistant holst has remained a major scientific mystery for a large part of the last century .",
    "it was completely understood only in 1957 when bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) formulated the microscopic theory of sc in metals.@xcite the central concept of the bcs theory is the weak electron - phonon interaction which leads to the appearance of an attractive potential between two electrons . as a consequence , some electrons form pairs , and thus , composite bosons .",
    "the long - range phase coherence among the pairs appears due to the overlap of their wavefunctions , leading to a peculiar correlated state of matter  a quantum state on a macroscopic scale , in which all the electron pairs move in a single coherent motion .    in 1986 , bednorz and mller found sc in la - ba - cu - o ceramics at 30 k.@xcite in 1993 , the maximum critical temperature of copper oxides ( cuprates ) reached 135 k. the crystal structure of cuprates is layered and highly anisotropic .",
    "the parent compounds of sc cuprates are antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulators .",
    "a mott insulator has a charge gap of @xmath3 2 ev , whereas the spin wave spectrum extends to zero energy .",
    "when cuprates are slightly doped by holes or electrons , on cooling they become sc .",
    "the doped carriers are accumulated in two - dimensional cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "thus , for sc in cuprates , the carrier density in cuo@xmath1 planes is the main factor .",
    "sc occurs at low temperatures when the doping level is approximately one doped carrier per three cu@xmath4 ions ( @xmath3 16% ) .",
    "soon after the discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductivity ( htsc ) , it became clear that the concept of the fermi liquid is not applicable to cuprates : the normal state properties of cuprates are markedly different from those of conventional metals .",
    "a normal - state partial gap , the pseudogap ( pg ) , appearing in electronic excitation spectra of cuprates above @xmath0 , is one of the main features of htscs.@xcite there is an interesting contrast between the development of the physics of cuprates and that of the physics of conventional scs .",
    "just before the creation of the bcs theory , the normal - state properties of conventional metals were very well understood ; however sc was not .",
    "the situation with the cuprates was just the opposite : at the time htsc was discovered , there already existed a good understanding of the phenomenon of sc , but the normal - state properties of cuprates were practically unknown .",
    "in addition to their peculiar normal - state properties , several experiments show that some sc properties of cuprates deviate from predictions of the bcs theory .",
    "for example , the isotope effect is almost absent in _ optimally _ doped cuprates.@xcite thus , on a microscopic scale , there is a clear difference between conventional scs and htscs , namely that they have a different origin and that different criteria are required for htscs than for classical scs . in the absence of a commonly accepted theory of htsc , it is still time to discuss experimental data obtained in cuprates .",
    "the main purpose of this brief review is to present a more or less coherent picture of the mechanism of htsc based mainly on tunneling measurements in cuprates . in the review",
    ", we shall focus our attention on hole - doped cuprates .",
    "we shall mainly discuss tunneling _ spectroscopy _ in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bi2212 ) performed by the present author .",
    "we shall also use some inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) and muon spin resonance ( @xmath5sr ) data .",
    "the main ideas of the review appeared in 1998.@xcite since the review is based on experimental data , the reader will not find many formulas in the text , not a single hamiltonian .",
    "_ due to the restriction on the number of pages in a review , only limited number of experimental data can be presented here . _",
    "more tunneling data and a more detailed description of the mechanism of htsc based on the data can be found elsewhere.@xcite    analysis of the data shows that ( i ) there are two sc gaps in cuprates : a pairing and a phase coherence gap .",
    "( ii ) tunneling spectra below @xmath0 are a combination of coherent qp peaks and incoherent part from a normal - state pg .",
    "( iii ) the `` tunneling ''",
    "normal - state pg is most likely a charge gap .",
    "( iv ) however , sc cuprates have the second normal - state pg which is magnetic and , most likely , spatially separated from the charge pg .",
    "( v ) just above @xmath0 , incoherent cooper pairs contribute to the `` tunneling '' pg .",
    "( vi ) there is a clear correlation between the magnitude of pairing gap and the magnitude of `` tunneling '' pg in bi2212 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "( vii ) tunneling characteristics corresponding to the sc condensate are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for topological excitations ( solitons ) .",
    "( viii ) in addition , analysis of ins and @xmath5sr data shows that the long - range phase coherence occurring at @xmath0 is established due to spin fluctuations into cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "let us start the review with the  basics , \" i.e. with what is widely accepted .",
    "figure 1 shows a sketch of phase diagram of hole - doped cuprates . at low doping level , cuprates are af .",
    "the sc state occurs at higher hole concentrations in cuo@xmath1 planes . if in la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( lsco )",
    ", there is a distance between the af and sc phases , in yba@xmath1cu@xmath10o@xmath11 ( ybco ) , the sc state practically evolves from the af phase .    in conventional scs , the critical temperature rises monotonically with the rise of charge - carrier concentration , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the carrier concentration . in cuprates ,",
    "the @xmath14 dependence is nonmonotonic . in hole - doped cuprates ,",
    "the @xmath14 dependence has a bell - like shape and , in most of them , can be approximated by the empirical expression @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the maximum critical temperature for a given compound.@xcite sc occurs within the limits 0.05 @xmath17 which vary slightly in different cuprates .",
    "different doping regions of the sc phase are mainly known as _ underdoped _ ( @xmath18 ) , _ optimally doped _",
    "( @xmath19 ) and _ overdoped _ ( @xmath20 )",
    ". the insulating phase at @xmath21 0.05 is usually called the _ undoped _ region . above @xmath22 0.27 ,",
    "cuprates are practically metallic .",
    "the state above the sc dome is often called a strange metal .",
    "paradoxically , the @xmath16 in cuprates is located near @xmath13 = 0.16 , whereas the sc condensation energy has the maximum in the overdoped region near @xmath13 = 0.19.@xcite    the pg , a normal - state partial gap appearing in electronic excitation spectra of cuprates above @xmath0 , is not shown in fig",
    "the reason is very simple : there is no agreement on the _ exact _ doping dependence of the pg . in spite of the fact that there is a consensus on _ general _ doping dependence of the pg in hole - doped cuprates ",
    "the magnitude of the pg decreases with increase of hole concentration  however , there is a clear discrepancy between the phase diagrams inferred from transport , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and heat - capacity measurements , on one hand , and from tunneling measurements , on the other hand .",
    "transport , nmr and heat - capacity measurements show that , in the overdoped region , the pg is absent above @xmath0 . at the same time , in tunneling measurements , the pg is observed well above @xmath0 . generally speaking ,",
    "the pg in cuprates may arise from charge - density waves ( cdw ) , local af correlations [ or spin - density waves ( sdw ) ] , or from their combination .",
    "incoherent cooper pairs may also induce a pg . from the common sense , however , the pg is most likely a charge gap because , at low doping level , cuprates are af mott insulators and , therefore , a spin gap is absent at low @xmath13",
    ". alternatively , there are two pgs in cuprates .",
    "the tunneling spectroscopy is a powerful tool , and has played a crucial role in the verification of the bcs theory.@xcite tunneling spectroscopy is particularly sensitive to the density of state ( dos ) near the fermi level , @xmath23 , and , thus , is capable of detecting any gap in the quasiparticle ( qp ) excitation spectrum at @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , it has a very high energy resolution : less than @xmath24 for sc - insulator - sc ( sis ) junctions , where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant . in comparison with photoemission measurements ,",
    "tunneling spectroscopy has an additional advantage : to measure the dos locally .",
    "consider the flow of electrons across a thin insulating layer having the thickness of a few nanometers , which separates a normal metal from a conventional sc .",
    "figure 2a shows a sc - insulator - normal metal ( sin ) tunneling junction . at @xmath26 = 0",
    ", no tunneling current can appear if the absolute value of the applied voltage ( bias ) in the junction is less than @xmath27 .",
    "tunneling will become possible when the applied bias reaches the value of @xmath28 , as shown in fig .",
    "figure 2c shows schematically three current - voltage @xmath29 characteristics for an sin junction at @xmath26 = 0 , 0 @xmath30 and @xmath31 . at @xmath26 = 0",
    ", the absence of a tunneling current at small voltages constitutes an experimental proof of the existence of a gap in the energy spectrum of a sc . at @xmath32 , there are always excited electrons due to thermal excitations . as shown in fig .",
    "2c , the @xmath29 curves , obtained below @xmath0 , approach at high bias the @xmath29 characteristic measured above @xmath0 ( i.e. ohm s line ) . in conventional scs , the gap completely vanishes at @xmath0 .",
    "this , however , is not the case for cuprates which show the presence of a pg above @xmath0 .      in the framework of the bcs theory ,",
    "the dos of qp excitations in the sc state , @xmath33 , and the dos in the normal state @xmath34 relate to each other at @xmath26 = 0 as @xmath35 in most low-@xmath0 scs , @xmath36 is normally constant over the energy range of interest .",
    "a @xmath37 tunneling characteristic obtained in an sin junction corresponds directly to the dos of qp excitations in a sc . in a first approximation , assuming that the normal metal has a constant dos near the fermi level and the transmission of the barrier ( insulator ) is independent of energy , the tunneling conductance @xmath37 is proportional to the dos of a sc , broadened by the fermi function @xmath38^{-1}$ ] .",
    "thus , at low temperature @xmath39de \\cong n_s(ev),\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the electron charge , and the origin of energy scale @xmath41 in the tunneling spectra corresponds to the fermi level of the sc .",
    "consequently , the differential conductance at negative ( positive ) voltage reflects the dos below ( above ) @xmath23 .    in order to smooth the gap - related structures in the dos @xmath42 ,",
    "a phenomenological smearing parameter @xmath43 was introduced , which accounts for a lifetime broadening of qps ( @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the lifetime of qp excitations).@xcite the energy @xmath41 in the dos function is replaced by @xmath46 : @xmath47 where we introduced @xmath48 which is the @xmath49-dependent energy gap for the general case of an anisotropic gap . in the two - dimensional case ,",
    "the integration is reduced to the in - plane angle , 0 @xmath50 .    in sin tunneling junctions of conventional scs",
    ", there is good agreement between the theory and experiment . as an example",
    ", figure 2d shows the correspondence between experimental data obtained in nb and the theoretical curve .      in an sis junction ,",
    "the tunneling conductance is proportional to the convolution of the dos function of a sc with itself . in the case of symmetrical sis contacts , the expression for the tunneling current through contacts at finite temperature",

    "the expression for tunneling conductance at finite temperature can be presented as @xmath53 de,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the conductance in the normal state .",
    "if , in sin tunneling junctions of s - wave scs , there is good agreement between the theory and experiment , as shown in fig . 2d , in sis junctions the correspondence between the bcs dos and experimental data is poor ( see p. 31 in ref .",
    "overdoped bi2212 single crystals were grown by the self - flux method in al@xmath1o@xmath10 and zro@xmath1 crucibles and then mechanically separated from the flux .",

    "the @xmath0 value was determined by the four - contact method yielding @xmath0 = 8790 k with the transition width less than 1 k. the underdoped bi2212 single crystals were obtained by annealing the overdoped crystals in vacuum .",
    "bi2212 single crystals in which cu is partially substituted for ni or zn were also grown by the self - flux method . as measured by edx",
    "the chemical composition of the bi-2:2:1:2 phase in ni - doped and zn - doped bi2212 single crystals corresponds to the formula bi@xmath1sr@xmath63ca@xmath64(cuni)@xmath65o@xmath59 and bi@xmath1sr@xmath66ca@xmath67(cuni)@xmath1o@xmath59 , respectively . in these single crystals",

    "the @xmath0 value was determined by the four - contact method : @xmath0 = 7577 k in ni - doped bi2212 and @xmath0 = 7678 k in zn - doped bi2212 . in both types of single crystals ,",
    "the transition width is a few degrees .",
    "most tunneling data presented in this review were obtained by the break - junction ( bj ) technique .",
    "figure 3 schematically depicts the bj setup .",
    "a single crystal is glued to a flexible insulating substrate , as shown in fig . 3 ,",
    "such that the @xmath68 plane of the crystal is perpendicular to the substrate surface .",
    "four electrical contacts ( typically with a resistance of a few ohms ) are made by attaching gold wires to the crystal by silver paint .",
    "the diameter of golden wires is 25 @xmath5 m .",
    "two contacts situated diagonally are used for bias input , which is slightly modulated by a lock - in , and the other two for measuring @xmath37 and @xmath29 tunneling characteristics . at low temperature ,",
    "the crystal is broken in an he ambient in the @xmath68 plane by bending the flexible substrate .",
    "the bending force is applied by the differential screw shown schematically in fig .",
    "3 . the differential screw has a precision of 10 @xmath5 m per turn .",
    "tunneling is achieved by changing the distance between broken parts of the crystal .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath29 tunneling characteristics are determined by a standard lock - in modulation technique .    in one junction ,",
    "a few tunneling spectra are usually obtained at low ( constant ) temperature by changing the distance between broken parts of a crystal , going back and forth etc . , and each time the tunneling occurs most likely in different places .",
    "in addition to sis - junction measurements , tunneling tests have also been carried out in bi2212 single crystals by forming sin junctions . in point - contact measurements ,",
    "the differential screw shown in fig .",
    "3 is used to push a normal tip against a fixed single crystal .",
    "pt - ir and ag wires sharpened mechanically were used as normal tips .",
    "the point - contact measurements were performed either along or perpendicular to the @xmath62 crystal axis .",
    "in this section , we discuss data obtained exclusively in _ tunneling _ regime , i.e. in junctions with a large normal resistance , @xmath69 .",
    "let us start with sin data .",
    "figure 4a shows a conductance taken in an optimally doped bi2212 single crystal .",
    "the conductance reflects typical features of bi2212 spectra , namely , well - defined qp peaks , dips and humps outside the gap structure .",
    "the other feature of sin conductances obtained in htsc is that the height of the qp peaks is asymmetrical relatively zero bias : the qp peak at negative bias is always higher than that at positive bias ( in sis junctions , this is not the case ) . in sin conductances ,",
    "the humps are always situated at bias which is three times as large as that of the qp peaks , @xmath70 .",
    "outside humps , the conductance is more or less constant .",
    "the magnitude of a sc gap can , in fact , be derived directly from the tunneling spectrum . however , in the absence of a generally accepted model for the gap function and the dos in cuprates , such a quantitative analysis is not straightforward .",
    "thus , in order to compare different spectra , we calculate the gap @xmath71 magnitude in sin junctions as a half spacing between the qp peaks at @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "4a , the magnitude of energy gap is about 37 mev , while the humps are situate at about @xmath73110 mv .",
    "the gap inferred from conductances obtained in the _ tunneling _ regime will be referred to as the pairing gap , @xmath74 .",
    "tunneling sin data can directly be compared with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data .",
    "figure 4b shows an arpes spectrum having the same peak - dip - hump structure as the sin conductance in fig .",
    "4a . in the apres spectrum ,",
    "the qp peak is situated at about 40 mev , and the hump is at about 120 mev .",
    "let us discuss now data obtained in sis junctions .",
    "figure 4c shows typical @xmath37 and @xmath29 tunneling characteristics for sis junctions of bi2212 .",
    "in addition to the peak - dip - hump structure , the conductance in fig .",
    "4c exhibits also a peak at zero bias due to the josephson current . in sis conductances ,",
    "the distance between the peaks is @xmath75 , the dips are more pronounced , and the humps appears at bias @xmath76 .",
    "as we shall see further , the humps in sin conductance correspond to a normal - state gap , the tunneling pg . if so , then , in sis spectra , the humps should be situated at bias of @xmath77 , and not at @xmath78 . as a matter of fact",
    ", there are humps in sis spectra at bias of @xmath79 ; however , they are very weak : they can be seen in fig .",
    "4d . the main humps in sis conductances are in fact the superposition of `` qp peaks '' and `` true humps '' as illustrated in fig .",
    "this is the reason why the main humps in sis spectra are situated at bias of @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath29 characteristics of cuprates will be considered in detail further .    as was mentioned in introduction , for sc in cuprates , the carrier density in cuo@xmath1 planes , @xmath13 ,",
    "is the main factor .",
    "the magnitude of pairing energy gap , @xmath74 , also depends on @xmath13 .",
    "the dependence @xmath80 in bi2212 is monotonic as shown in fig . 6 : the magnitude of @xmath74 decreases as the doping level increases .",
    "experimentally , the magnitude of @xmath74 in bi2212 linearly decreases as @xmath13 increases : @xmath81 $ ] ( in mev).@xcite in fig .",
    "6a , one can see that there is a correlation between the magnitude of energy gap and the height and width of qp peaks : the smaller the gap magnitude is , the higher and narrower the qp peaks are .",
    "_ however _ , if one normalizes the conductances by height and by gap magnitude simultaneously , they all collapse in one curve ( the peaks , _ not the humps _ )",
    "( see fig .",
    "12.47 in ref .",
    "performing tunneling measurements not only in tunneling regime but also in junctions with small @xmath83 , one will discover that there is another energy scale in cuprates .",
    "figure 7 shows two conductances obtained within the same bi2212 single crystal by sis junctions .",
    "one can see that these two spectra are different : they have different shapes and different magnitudes .",
    "the upper conductance has a subgap and a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) due to the josephson current , while the other does not . instead ,",
    "the lower curve is smooth between the qp peaks and has dips and humps outside the gap structure .",
    "these differences reflect the physics of the sc state in cuprates .",
    "the upper curve is measured in a junction with low @xmath83 , while the lower curve in a junction with high @xmath83 .",
    "these two conductances reflect the two energy gaps , @xmath82 and @xmath74 , where @xmath82 is the phase coherence gap .",
    "thus , @xmath82 manifests itself in tunneling spectra _ exclusively _ in junctions with low @xmath83 ( @xmath84 3 k@xmath85 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath74 appears in high-@xmath83 junctions .",
    "conductances corresponding to @xmath74 always show the peak - dip - hump structure . in conductances corresponding to @xmath82 ,",
    "the dips are either absent or very weak . in low-@xmath83 junctions ,",

    "the two energy gaps are also present in@xcite ybco and in electron - doped nd@xmath7ce@xmath8cuo@xmath9 ( ncco).@xcite",

    "it is important to note that arpes studies@xcite do not detect the presence of @xmath82 ; therefore , the @xmath82 scale in fig .",
    "8 has exclusively the magnetic origin .",
    "there are no charges at @xmath89 , they are `` located '' at the @xmath80 scale .",
    "performing tunneling measurements in junctions with different @xmath83 , one will find that , at any fixed @xmath13 , there is a distribution of gap magnitude , in a first approximation , between @xmath82 and @xmath97 .",
    "the scale of the distribution depends also on the tunneling angle into and out of the cuo@xmath1 planes .",

    "9a , neither the average nor the maximum @xmath103 are in agreement with the proportionality @xmath104 .",

    "14 , we assumed that @xmath135 since @xmath130 .",

    "ni and zn are the most suitable for this task because they are situated next to cu in the periodic table of chemical elements .",
    "indeed , despite their similar effect on @xmath0 ( except in ybco ) , ni and zn doped in cuo@xmath1 planes cause very different effects on their local environment.@xcite    figure 15 presents three typical conductances obtained in pristine , ni- and zn - doped bi2212 single crystals .",

    "we now turn our attention to an anomaly in tunneling @xmath29 characteristics obtained in cuprates . according to the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) predictions@xcite for sin junctions of conventional scs ,",
    "it is anticipated that , in the _ tunneling _ regime , @xmath29 curves at high positive ( low negative ) bias , depending on @xmath83 , lie somewhat below ( above ) normal - state curves . in conventional scs , the btk predictions are verified by tunneling experiments . as an example , figure 2c shows typical @xmath29 characteristics of sin junctions for conventional scs . in cuprates , however , the btk theory is violated .",
    "figure 16a depicts sis @xmath29 and @xmath37 characteristics measured in bi2212 . in fig .",

    "curve in fig .",
    "16a deviates from the theory.@xcite ] this fact can not be explained by the d - wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "we shall refer to this positive offset in @xmath29 curves as the anomaly .",
    "this anomaly is a manifestation of intrinsic properties of cuprates : it appears not only in overdoped bi2212 but also , as we shall see further , in underdoped bi2212 as well .",
    "sin @xmath29 curves of bi2212 exhibit the anomaly too , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the anomaly is also present in @xmath29 characteristics of ybco , as depicted in fig .",
    "the anomaly in @xmath29 characteristics relates to @xmath74 and , therefore , vanishes slightly above @xmath0 . in figs .",
    "16c and 16d , the anomaly is absent , and a small `` negative '' offset from the straight line is caused by the pg .",
    "thus , the sc condensate gives rise to an anomaly in @xmath29 characteristics of cuprates , on top of a contribution from the pg which has a small `` negative '' offset from the straight line .",
    "the magnitude of `` negative '' offset scales with with the pg magnitude : the larger the pg magnitude is , the larger the `` negative '' offset is ( see fig . 12.10 in ref . 6 ) .",
    "knowing tunneling characteristics obtained deep below @xmath0 and somewhat above @xmath0 , and by taking the difference between the spectra , one can estimate a contribution in the tunneling spectra from the sc condensate .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to one used in ins measurements . in our case",
    ", however , such a subtraction leads only to an estimation of the contribution because by subtracting the spectra we assume that the pg crosses @xmath0 without modification .",
    "however , as discussed above , this is not the case , particularly , at low bias .    in order to compare two sets of tunneling spectra",
    ", they should be normalized .",
    "the conductance curves can be easily normalized at high bias , as illustrated in fig .",
    "17a . how to normalize the corresponding @xmath29 curves",
    "is not a trivial question .",
    "the conductance curves at high bias , thus , far away from the gap structure , are almost constant .",
    "consequently , in a sis junction , by normalizing two conductance curves at high bias , the equation @xmath136 holds at bias @xmath137 , where @xmath40 is the electron charge . by integrating the equation we have @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the constant , meaning that the corresponding @xmath140 curves are parallel to each other at high bias , as depicted in fig . 17b .",
    "the extracted @xmath29 and @xmath37 characteristics of the sc condensate appearing in sis and sin junctions of overdoped bi2212 are presented in figs .",
    "17c and 17d , respectively .",
    "figure 17e shows a _ low - temperature _ contribution of the sc condensate to tunneling spectra in _ underdoped _ bi2212 . at high bias , the @xmath29 curves in figs",
    "17c17e reach a plateau value . at the gap bias , they rise / fall sharply and , at low bias , the curves go to zero . in figs .",
    "17c and 17d , the negative slope of the @xmath29 curves at low bias , signifying a negative differential resistance , is an artifact which a consequence of a rough estimation .",
    "figure 17f depicts idealized @xmath29 and @xmath37 characteristics of the sc condensate which summarize the observed tendencies .",
    "the plateau value in the @xmath29 curve is small in the underdoped region and increases as the doping level rises .",
    "let us consider the temperature dependence of the contributions from the sc condensate to tunneling spectra of cuprates , shown in fig .",
    "17f . on heating ,",
    "the plateau value of @xmath29 curves decreases , and the distance between qp peaks in conductances decreases too ( see fig . 6.5 in ref . 6 or fig . 6.45 in ref . 7 ) .",
    "the contributions vanish completely at @xmath108 .",
    "then , a question naturally arises : where do the states of qp peaks go to ?",
    "figure 18 shows a sketch of electronic states transfer in cuprates at different temperatures , based on tunneling and arpes data . at @xmath141",
    ", there are no in - gap states ( except thermal excitations ) . at @xmath142 , there appear mid - gap states transfered from high energies . at @xmath143 ,",
    "the mid - gap states split into two levels , as shown in fig .",
    "interestingly , arpes spectra which reflect the states exclusively above the fermi level pass the middle step in fig . 18 unnoticed . thus , in arpes spectra , the qp - peak states seem to appear directly from high energies .",
    "it is worth to remind that , in contrast to tunneling spectroscopy which probe the local dos , arpes probes the whole surface of a sample .",
    "the occurrence of in - gap states , as those in fig .",
    "18 , is typical for system having topological solitons , for example , in polyacetylene ( for a review , see chapter 5 in ref .",
    "moreover , the @xmath29 and @xmath37 characteristics of the sc condensate depicted in fig .",
    "17f are in good agreement with theoretical ones derived for topological solitons.@xcite on the whole , the concept is also in agreement with the davydov bisoliton theory of htsc.@xcite the bisoliton theory utilizes the concept of _ bisolitons_electron ( or hole ) pairs coupled in a singlet state due to a local deformation of the lattice .",
    "thus , in the framework of the bisoliton theory , the nonlinear electron - phonon interaction is responsible for the qp pairing . a possibility for the occurrence of bipolaron sc in quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) systems",
    "was suggested for the first time by brazovskii and kirova in 1981.@xcite    let us consider the derived characteristics for tunneling spectra obtained in a system with bisolitons .",
    "in such a system , the @xmath29 characteristic obtained in an sin junction should have the following shape @xmath144,\\ ] ] where @xmath145 is voltage ( bias ) ; @xmath146 is the peak bias , and @xmath147 and @xmath148 are constants ( `` c '' denotes current , and `` n '' an sin junction )",
    ". then , the corresponding conductance will have the shape given by @xmath149,\\ ] ] where @xmath150 is a constant ( `` q '' denotes qp peaks ) . in the equations",
    ", @xmath148 determines the width of conductance peaks . in tunneling spectra",
    ", the characteristics of bisolitons will appear on top of tunneling characteristics of other electronic states present in the system ( in our case , a pg ) .    in sis junctions ,",
    "tunneling characteristics represent the convolution of the dos with itself . in this particular case",
    ", the convolution can not be resolved analytically . however , as shown elsewhere,@xcite in a _ first _",
    "approximation , sis tunneling spectra obtained in a system with bisolitons can be fitted by @xmath151,\\ ] ] @xmath152,\\ ] ] where @xmath147 , @xmath150 and @xmath148 are constants ( `` s '' denotes an sis junction ) .",
    "let us use these functions to fit tunneling data .",
    "figures 19a19c depict tunneling @xmath29 characteristics and the corresponding @xmath153 fits . for simplicity",
    ", we analyze the @xmath29 data only at positive bias . in figs .",
    "19b and 19c , the @xmath154 and @xmath155 fits , respectively , are adjusted so that the differences between the @xmath29 curves and the fits look similar to the @xmath29 characteristic of the pg shown in fig .",
    "19a . in figs .",
    "19b and 19c , the amplitude of the @xmath153 functions , @xmath147 , can be changed  this will affect only the scale but not the shape of the differences corresponding to the pg .",
    "thus , any @xmath29 curve measured in bi2212 can be easily resolved into the two components if the `` sc component '' is interpolated by the corresponding @xmath153 function .",
    "the conductances and the corresponding @xmath156 fits are depicted in figs .",
    "it is worth to remind that the @xmath156 functions are assumed to fit exclusively the qp peaks , but not the humps . in fig .",
    "19 , one can find good correspondence between the tunneling data and the bisoliton characteristics .",
    "the numbers used in the @xmath153 and @xmath156 functions shown in fig .",
    "19 can be found in table 12.1 in ref .",
    "the presence of soliton - like excitations in cuprates implies the presence of quasi-1d in cuo@xmath1 planes . there is evidence for charge stripes in underdoped lsco.@xcite transport properties of underdoped ybco is quasi-1d , and there is a kind of charge ordering in undoped ybco , e.g. cdw.@xcite on the other hand , the existence of quasi-1d qps in cuprates is not a new revelation since induced cooper pairs on chains in ybco are quasi-1d",
    "this fact is already known since 1987 , after the discovery of sc in ybco .",
    "alternatively , for example , discrete breathers which are also topological excitations can exist without the presence of quasi-1d in a system ( for information about discrete breathers , see section 13 in chapter 5 of ref .",
    "a possibility for the existence of discrete breathers in cuprates was suggested for the first time in 1996.@xcite recently , defuse x - ray scattering measurements revealed the existence of lattice modulations favorable for discrete breathers.@xcite the @xmath157 lattice modulation in cuprates may occur due to `` frozen '' discrete breathers .",
    "at the end , let us discuss a few important issues .",
    "first of all , let us sort out an important question related to the presence of two energy gaps in a sc .",
    "there exist at least two possibilities for a sc to have two energy gaps .",
    "first , there are two condensates in a sc , as in mgb@xmath1 , for example . in this case the two gaps are independent , and each of them belongs to one of the condensates .",
    "second , there is only one set of cooper pairs in a sc with a pairing gap @xmath74 .",
    "they are incoherent above @xmath0 . due to some bosonic excitations which are different from those responsible for the pairing , the cooper pairs condense at @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for the cooper pairs , the energy gap @xmath74 is `` internal , '' while the phase coherence gap , @xmath82 , is `` external . ''",
    "it is easy enough to discriminate these two cases . in the first case",
    ", the two gaps will appear in arpes spectra , while in the second case , only the pairing gap ( or @xmath158 ) will be seen by aprpes . in cuprates ,",
    "arpes detects only @xmath74 .",
    "this signifies that there is only one set of cooper pairs in cuprates .",
    "as shown above , spin fluctuations mediate the long - range phase coherence in cuprates .",
    "this means that @xmath82 has the d@xmath159 symmetry.@xcite according to the third principle of sc presented elsewhere,@xcite which states that _ the mechanism of electron pairing and the mechanism of cooper - pair condensation must be different _ , it is most likely that the electron - phonon interaction is responsible for the qp pairing in cuprates .",
    "analysis of some experimental facts points out in the same direction.@xcite as a reminder , in conventional scs , the two mechanism are different too : the electron - phonon interaction leads to the electron pairing , while the overlap of their wavefunctions is responsible for the phase coherence .",
    "what is the symmetry of @xmath74 in this case in cuprates ? from arpes , it is strongly anisotropic and , _ probably _ , has an s - wave symmetry .    what is the main cause of the onset of sc in cuprates ?",
    "after the charge - carrier doping which is absolutely necessary , the main cause of the occurrence of sc in cuprates is their * unstable lattice*. experimentally , the lattice in cuprates is very unstable especially at low temperatures . upon lowering the temperature ,",
    "all sc cuprates undergo several structural phase transitions . in cuprates ,",
    "the unstable lattice provokes a phase separation taking place in cuo@xmath1 planes on the nanoscale ( @xmath3 a few nanometers ) .",
    "because of a lattice mismatch between different layers in _ doped _ cuprates , below a certain temperature in cuo@xmath1 planes there appear , _ at least _ , two different phases which fluctuate .",
    "the doped charges prefer to join one of these phases , avoiding the other(s ) . by doing so",
    ", the charge presence on one phase enlarges the difference between the two phases .",
    "thus , the phase separation is self - sustaining .",
    "clusters containing the hole - poor phase in cuo@xmath1 planes remain antiferromagnetically ordered ( at least , up to @xmath129 0.19 ) .",
    "this phase separation taking place in the normal state of cuprates on the nanoscale is the main key point for understanding of the mechanism of unconventional sc .",
    "spin fluctuations necessary for the phase coherence in cuprates , e.g. the so - called magnetic resonance peak , are most likely induced by dynamically fluctuating charge stripes and/or discrete breathers . generally speaking ,",
    "a charge ordering is a manifestation of self - trapped states due to the moderately strong electron - phonon interaction .",
    "intrinsically , the charge stripes are insulating , i.e. there is a charge gap on the stripes . however , if it is the case , the presence of soliton - like excitations on the stripes makes them conducting .    in a _ first _",
    "approximation , unconventional sc in cuprates can be described by a combination of two theoretical models : the bisoliton@xcite and spin - fluctuation@xcite theories .",
    "for example , the isotope effect in cuprates is in good agreement with the bisoliton theory.@xcite",
    "to summarize , analysis of the data , mainly tunneling , shows that ( i ) there are two sc gaps in cuprates : a pairing and a phase coherence gap .",
    "( ii ) tunneling spectra below @xmath0 are a combination of coherent qp peaks and incoherent part from a normal - state pg .",
    "( iii ) the `` tunneling '' normal - state pg is most likely a charge gap .",
    "( iv ) however , cuprates have the second normal - state pg which is magnetic and , most likely , spatially separated from the charge pg . ( v ) just above @xmath0 , incoherent cooper pairs contribute to the `` tunneling '' pg . ( vi )",
    "there is a clear correlation between the magnitude of pairing gap and the magnitude of `` tunneling '' pg in bi2212 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "( vii ) the cooper pairs in cuprates are most likely topological excitations .",
    "they either reside on charge stripes or represent discrete breathers .",
    "( viii ) the long - range phase coherence occurring at @xmath0 is established due to spin fluctuations into cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "( ix ) it is most likely that the nonlinear electron - phonon interaction is responsible for the qp pairing in cuprates .",
