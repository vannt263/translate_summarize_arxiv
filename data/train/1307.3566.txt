    "the lhc experiments have discovered a standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson with @xmath11  gev  @xcite . however , it is not clear whether this newly discovered particle is a pure sm higgs boson , or whether it is part of an extension of the sm , which might also include multiple or composite higgs - like states .",
    "precise measurements of the higgs couplings and branching ratios will be required to resolve this question .",
    "another , more direct way to gain insights about physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) would obviously be to discover more new particles directly .",
    "a well - motivated extension of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) , a fully renormalisable theory of high predictive power . in this model , the u(1 ) ,",
    "su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge couplings can unify , and a dark matter candidate can be naturally accommodated . furthermore , supersymmetry stabilises the higgs potential with respect to quadratically divergent radiative corrections . in the mssm",
    "the higgs mass is no longer a free parameter but becomes strongly constrained .",
    "if nature is supersymmetric at the electroweak scale , a large number of new superpartner mass parameters is introduced whose values depend on the unknown mechanism of supersymmetry breaking at high energies .",
    "this poses a challenge for any phenomenological analysis . due to the large number of unknown parameters it is very difficult to make reliable predictions for susy background processes , and in many cases the worst background contributions for susy signals originate in fact from susy processes .",
    "the experiments at the lhc have not yet found any hints for supersymmetry in squark and gluino searches  @xcite , which points towards a rather heavy coloured superpartner spectrum with soft masses above a . however , there are large regions in the mssm parameter space which lead to a sm - like higgs with @xmath12  gev , a light electroweak susy sector , and a rather heavy coloured susy sector beyond the current lhc discovery range . in general ,",
    "if the electroweak sector is light enough , it should be possible to discover neutralinos and charginos via drell  yan production at the lhc  @xcite , and the lhc experiments have already put limits on the electroweak - ino parameter space under several simplified model assumptions @xcite .",
    "however , in cases where these light states are very close in mass and their decay products are therefore very soft , it will be almost impossible to observe such processes at the lhc .",
    "an example is given by scenarios in which the higgsino mass parameter @xmath6 is much smaller than the electroweak gaugino masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( current bounds require only @xmath13{gev}$ ] in order to avoid the limits from lep chargino searches  @xcite ) .",
    "then , the new light states are a chargino and two neutralinos which are higgsino - like and almost mass degenerate .",
    "the chargino and the heavier neutralino therefore decay only into extremely soft sm particles and the invisible lightest neutralino .",
    "the most `` natural '' versions of the phenomenological mssm which are still not ruled out are indeed characterised by higgsino masses of a few 100 , together with sub- third - generation squarks and a moderately heavy gluino , while the rest of the spectrum can be in the multi - tev range @xcite .",
    "models with light higgsinos are also attractive for cosmology , either in combination with gravitino dark matter or with a higgsino - like neutralino as a non - thermally produced lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "while the light higgsino scenario is extremely challenging for the lhc , it may well be observable in the clean environment at an @xmath14 linear collider , for instance , at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite . at the ilc",
    ", the striking feature of a precisely known initial state allows to successfully apply the initial - state radiation ( isr ) method , i.e.  to select only those signal events that are accompanied by a sufficiently hard photon . in this context",
    ", polarised beams help to significantly enhance the signal cross section , at least in the chargino case .",
    "the subject of the present work is the phenomenology of light quasi - degenerate higgsinos at the ilc .",
    "we study their production and decay , and investigate in how far one can derive the fundamental mssm parameters without assuming any specific susy breaking scheme if only the light higgsinos are kinematically accessible .",
    "we study the processes @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath17  gev with polarised beams and initial - state radiation at the ilc .",
    "we simulate the detector response for two mssm benchmark points with different @xmath18 gev ) mass splittings between the chargino and neutralinos , leading to different final state sm particles .",
    "the uncertainties on masses , mass differences and cross sections as determined by our simulation study are then used as inputs for a fit in order to reconstruct the mssm parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath6 and @xmath19 .",
    "our overall goal is to determine both how well the chargino and neutralino masses can be measured at the ilc , and what could be inferred from such a measurement about the underlying susy model .    in the following chapters we first give an overview of the theoretical arguments in favour of light higgsinos and the phenomenological aspects of such scenarios in the mssm .",
    "the expected sm background will also be discussed , including beam conditions and detector capabilities at the ilc . in section 3",
    "we define two benchmark scenarios on which our study will be based and provide the details for the detector simulation . in section 4 we discuss the expected experimental results at the ilc . in section 5",
    "we present our results on reconstructing the fundamental parameters and the precision we expect to achieve with our analysis strategy .",
    "there are two main reasons why higgsinos are distinguished among the mssm superpartners of the sm particles .",
    "first , the size of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath6 is not necessarily related to the scale of susy breaking , as it is allowed by unbroken supersymmetry ( it is indeed the only dimensionful mssm parameter with this property ) .",
    "it can therefore be generated independently of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms , and at leading order does not receive any soft - term - dependent radiative corrections in the evolution from the high scale .",
    "second , @xmath6 enters the tree - level higgs potential and is therefore directly connected to the electroweak scale .",
    "for instance , the tree - level @xmath20 boson mass is given in terms of the higgs soft masses @xmath21 , the ratio @xmath19 of higgs vacuum expectation values , and @xmath6 as @xmath22 to avoid finely tuned large cancellations among these parameters , it follows that @xmath6 should not be too far above the electroweak scale , even if some or all of the squark , slepton and gaugino masses are much larger .",
    "these two arguments are the main motivation for investigating models where the higgsinos are light , while the other mssm superpartners may be much heavier .      from a top - down perspective",
    ", light higgsinos are equally well motivated .",
    "for instance , they are generic in certain models of hybrid gauge - gravity mediation  @xcite , whose main features we will now briefly recapitulate . in gauge - mediated susy breaking , some of the hidden sector states carry sm gauge charges .",
    "these messenger fields acquire large supersymmetric masses @xmath23 , and messenger loops generate soft terms of the order @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scale of susy breaking , and @xmath26 roughly counts the number of contributing messenger states .",
    "in addition to these , generically there are also gravity - mediated contributions to soft terms as well as a gravity - mediated effective @xmath6 parameter , generated by gravitationally suppressed interactions between the hidden sector and the mssm .",
    "they are of the order of the gravitino mass , @xmath27 in models where the mssm is embedded in a more fundamental theory , for instance in superstring compactifications , the details of supersymmetry breaking are often unknown , while the spectrum of sub - planckian states can still be calculated . in phenomenologically promising models ,",
    "these typically consist of the mssm along with a multitude of additional exotic states , some of which are charged under the sm gauge groups ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these exotic fields can be given large masses and act as gauge mediation messengers .",
    "a natural scale for them to decouple is the scale of the grand unification , @xmath28{gev}\\approx\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}m_{\\rm planck}\\,.\\ ] ] with some simple assumptions about the couplings of the messengers to the susy - breaking fields , and choosing parameters such that @xmath29 is of the order of the electroweak scale , one can obtain a realistic soft term spectrum . for large messenger multiplicities @xmath30 ,",
    "the soft terms are predominantly generated by gauge mediation and can be in the multi - tev range , while @xmath6 is induced by gravity mediation and of the order of @xmath31100@xmath32200@xmath33{gev}$ ] .",
    "the benchmark points we are using for the present analysis are derived from such hybrid gauge - gravity mediation models with large messenger numbers .",
    "however , we stress that these are by no means the only possibility to obtain light higgsinos from high - scale models , and that our results on the light higgsino phenomenology are independent of a specific susy breaking model .      in a more general context",
    ", scenarios with a rather heavy coloured sector and a mass - degenerate light chargino / neutralino sector can easily be constructed in the unconstrained mssm , where the soft susy - breaking parameters are taken as independent .",
    "one simply chooses sufficiently large values for the squark and gluino masses ( and possibly also for the slepton masses ) .    at the tree level the chargino / higgsino sector  @xcite",
    "is determined by the u(1 ) bino mass parameter @xmath9 , the su(2 ) wino mass parameter @xmath10 , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath6 and @xmath19 .",
    "the neutralino mass matrix in the @xmath34 basis is given by @xmath35 since @xmath36 is complex symmetric , it can be diagonalised by one unitary matrix @xmath37 via @xmath38 ( where the matrix @xmath39 contains the neutralino masses @xmath40 on the diagonal ) .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath37 relates the neutralino mass eigenstates to the neutral gauge eigenstates . for full analytical solutions of the system",
    "see  @xcite .    the chargino mass matrix in the @xmath41 basis",
    ", @xmath42 is not symmetric and therefore has to be diagonalised via the bi - unitary transformation @xmath43 . @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath45 relate the chargino mass eigenstates to the charged gauge eigenstates .",
    "in general , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath6 are complex - valued parameters . by a suitable rotation of the gaugino and higgsino fields",
    ", @xmath10 can be made real and positive without loss of generality . in the following",
    "we assume that also @xmath9 and @xmath6 are real ( positive or negative ) so no new sources of cp violation are introduced .",
    "one can easily classify three limiting cases : in the case @xmath46 , one obtains @xmath47 with a bino - like @xmath48 , @xmath49 with wino - like @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and higgsino - like heaviest states with masses @xmath52 , @xmath53 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : y ] ) and ( [ eq : x ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the hierarchy @xmath54 leads to the lightest two states being mass degenerate and wino - like , @xmath55 but a bino - like @xmath50 with mass @xmath56 , while @xmath57 and @xmath58 remain higgsino - like and heavy as before .    choosing @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 )",
    "leads to mass - degenerate lightest states with @xmath61 but @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) .",
    "the lighter neutralinos and the lightest chargino are then mostly higgsino - like and have unsuppressed couplings to the sm gauge bosons .",
    "this is the scenario which we are investigating .",
    "it is instructive to explicitly write down the tree - level masses of the three light states in the case that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are large . they are found by diagonalising the mass matrices of eqs .   and , and given by @xmath66 up to terms suppressed by higher powers of @xmath67 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the factors @xmath68 denote the sign of the mass eigenvalue , that depends on the cp - quantum number of the corresponding neutralino  @xcite .",
    "the wino and bino admixtures are small , of the order @xmath69 . for instance , for @xmath70 , the mass eigenstates are decomposed as @xmath71 where we have only written the respective leading - order terms of the weyl gaugino and higgsino components . for multi - tev gaugino masses ,",
    "the gaugino admixtures are of the order of a few percent , and the mass splittings are of the order of @xmath72@xmath73  gev .",
    "explicitly , the tree - level mass difference between the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino reads , again for @xmath70 , @xmath74 \\,,\\ ] ] which for @xmath75 further simplifies to @xmath76 for the neutralinos , the mass difference is @xmath77 remarkably , it does not depend on @xmath19 in the leading approximation .",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath78 are similar and the phenomenology of that parameter range has been discussed in  @xcite . in our case",
    "the sign of @xmath6 has negligible impact on observables .",
    "equations   hold for positive and negative values of @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to note that negative values of @xmath9 allow for cancellations of wino and bino contributions to neutralino masses .",
    "generally , they will result in different mass patterns depending on the sign of @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , for low values of @xmath19 the lightest neutralino can be heavier than the light chargino , i.e.  @xmath79 .",
    "both possibilities , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , will be analysed in section  [ sec : paradet ] .    comparing with the analytical formulae of the neutralino ( chargino ) masses and couplings @xcite , it is obvious that one can express the neutralino and chargino sector as functions of @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in the large @xmath19 limit , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , therefore all neutralino and chargino masses as well as",
    "the cross sections are only weakly dependent on @xmath19 .",
    "this weak dependence is also reflected in our final results , cf .",
    "section  [ sec : paradet ] .",
    "radiative corrections to the chargino and neutralino observables , see e.g.  @xcite ( and references therein for a more complete list of studies ) , can be sizeable and increase the mass splittings by several hundreds of mev . these corrections will lift the degeneracy between higgsino states . if the tree - level mass difference is substantially less than a gev , a correction of 200  mev  @xcite will have a profound impact on the lifetime and decay branching ratios .",
    "this may also be exploited to better determine the underlying mssm parameters , see  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of nlo corrections in this regard , is , however , beyond the scope of this study and in the following we will assume tree - level relations .    at the ilc higgsino production proceeds via @xmath20 or @xmath86 exchange in the @xmath87-channel ,",

    "the detector signature comprises exclusively a few low - energetic leptons or hadrons , whose softness poses a major challenge to experiment . for small mass splittings ,",
    "the radiative decay @xmath102 via a @xmath100-chargino loop can also become very important  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : chaprod],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=60.0% ]      for the discussion of the sm processes at the ilc it is convenient to classify them by the initial state and the number of final state fermions . due to the very strong fields between the colliding bunches",

    "therefore , the initial states can be @xmath14 , but also @xmath103 , or @xmath104 . for @xmath14 and @xmath103",
    ", the final state has an even number of fermions : 2f , 4f , 6f , ... , while the @xmath104 initial state gives rise to final states with an odd number of fermions : 1f , 3f , 5f , ... in this notation , @xmath86 can represent both real beam photons or virtual ones . for initial virtual photons ,",
    "the final state is understood to also contain the electron and/or positron that emitted the photon ( the  beam - remnant \" ) , in addition to the fermion(s ) .",
    "the signal comprises events with a few low - energy charged particles and no other activity .",
    "possible sm processes giving this topology are of two types . either ( _ i _ ) events with large amounts of energy in invisible neutrinos , or ( _ ii _ ) events where a large fraction of the energy escapes with particles going in un - instrumented regions of the detector ; in an ilc detector , the only such regions are the holes in the low - angle calorimeter through which the beam pipes enter the detector .",
    "the first background type mainly contains events with two @xmath105s , possibly together with additional neutrinos , i.e.  the subset of the classes @xmath106  2f and @xmath106  4f where one of the fermion pairs are @xmath105 leptons , and the other one ( if present ) is a neutrino pair .",
    "these channels do not have cross sections much larger than the signal .",
    "in addition , only a small fraction of the @xmath105s will decay to the very soft visible system which is typical for the signal .",
    "hence , while it is not negligible , this background type is expected to be manageable without too strong cuts on the event - topology .",
    "the potentially most severe background processes are of type ( _ ii _ ) , and are expected to be the high cross section multi - peripheral process @xmath107 ,",
    "i.e.  the @xmath108 2f class . in such events ,",
    "the final beam - remnant electrons and positrons carry nearly the full beam energy in most cases , have low transverse momentum , and therefore leave the detector unseen through the outgoing beam pipe .",
    "the @xmath109-pair , on the other hand , can be emitted at any angle , and tends to have low momentum .",
    "in other words , these events have a large resemblance to the signal .",
    "however , if one of the incoming electrons emits an isr photon at an angle and energy high enough to be detected , this electron will recoil against the photon , changing its direction sufficiently to deflect it into the acceptance of the detector . in order to reduce this background to acceptable levels",
    ", we therefore require that the accepted signal candidate events should contain a detected isr photon .",
    "also the other component of the @xmath108 2f class , where the initial photons are real photons from the photon component of the beams , is suppressed by this requirement .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that , in this case , there are no initial charged particles that could emit an isr photon .    instead",
    ", the most severe remaining background is expected to arise from the @xmath110 3f class , in particular from the @xmath88-channel diagram with incoming real photons .",
    "this process is similar to compton scattering , with the difference that the scattered photon is virtual , and gives rise to an @xmath109-pair . in this case",
    ", the hard isr photon does not recoil against the beam electron , but against the @xmath109-system , like in the signal events .",
    "however , in the event as a whole , a large amount of energy is carried away by the _ exchanged _ electron once it has been brought back on - shell by the beam - photon .",
    "this electron will receive most of the photon s energy , and closely follow its direction in the lab frame , i.e.  along the beam pipe . as the second incoming particle is neutral in this case , no isr will be emitted from it , and thus it can not be deflected into the detector acceptance either .",
    "for our simulation we chose two benchmark points with the lightest higgs mass which is compatible with the lhc discovery ( within the theory uncertainty ) , namely @xmath111 and @xmath112 gev",
    ". we will refer to them as dm1600 and dm770 , according to their chargino  lsp mass difference . in the following sections we will discuss their low - scale spectrum and the higgsino production and decay modes at the ilc as well as their implementation into our simulation .",
    "we especially comment on the decay modes and branching ratios in the nearly mass - degenerate @xmath113 system .    beyond the two specific mass differences considered here , it has been shown recently that the isr technique and the selection strategy described in the following are also sensitive in case of larger mass differences of a few gev  @xcite .",
    "as soon as the chargino  lsp mass difference becomes even larger , analyses without isr requirement start to gain sensitivity and eventually take over . for mass differences smaller than the ones considered here , striking signatures like displaced vertices , kinks , anomalous ionisation etc .",
