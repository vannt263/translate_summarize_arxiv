    ". the typical electron temperature of the adafs can be about one order of magnitude higher than the temperature of the electrons in the corona above the disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and the x - ray spectra of adafs are naturally harder than those of the corona in luminous agn .",

    "the cold disc is irradiated by the emission from the hot corona , and the evaporation of the gas in the cold disc is assumed to be balanced by the condensation of the gas in the corona in steady cases .",
    "the disc corona will transit to an adaf when the evaporation dominates over the condensation .",
    "thus , the typical timescale of the transition from the disc corona to an adaf is comparable with the evaporation timescale . at the transition radius @xmath13 , all the gas in the cold disc",
    "is evaporated into the hot corona , and we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 is loss rate of the gas evaporated in unit surface area of the disc , and @xmath80 is the surface density of the disc @xcite . the evaporation timescale can be estimated as @xmath81 comparing with equation ( [ tau_vis1 ] ) , we find that the viscous timescale of the disc is twice of the evaporation timescale .",

    "we simply adopt @xmath82 as the typical timescale of the variability caused by the variation of the transition radius @xmath13 .",
    "after taking account of a constant reflection component in the x - ray spectrathe amplitude of the constant refection component was chosen to have @xmath83 relative to the time - averaged continuum . , @xcite suggested the intrinsic x - ray photon index in individual agns varies as @xmath84 , consistent with the average spectral index ",

    "the response of the disc reflection to the central continuum is more complicated than a constant component @xcite .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic x - ray variation in individual agns should follow a slope steeper than @xmath84 , and in this work , assuming the reflection component responds well to central x - ray emission , we compare the binned spectral index - flux data with our model ( see the data points in fig . 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "the emission from the corona decreases rapidly with increasing transition radius , and therefore the observed emission is predominantly from the inner adaf truncated at a large radius @xmath42 , of which the spectrum is harder than that of the corona .",
    "thus , we find that the spectral index decreases with flux even if the mass accretion rate is fixed ( see fig . [ eddrat_gam ] ) .",
    "as a similar spectral index - flux correlation is present for most of the sources in the sample @xcite , we take the data of ngc  3516 as an example for comparison with our model .",
    "we find that the model calculation with a relative low @xmath85 can roughly reproduce the observed spectral index - flux data ( the green line in fig .",

    "this is independent of the mass accretion rate @xmath4 .",
    "it is found that the timescale of the x - ray variability caused by the transition radius changing is at the order of one year for a typical agn as ngc  3516 ( see the discussion in sect .",

    "this is roughly consistent with the observed light curves of these sources given in @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath88 for ngc  3516 , which is the minimal one in the sample with updated black hole mass data .",
    "this implies that the viscous timescales of other sources with similar or smaller black holes should be shorter than that of ngc  3516 . for the sources with softer x - ray spectra , i.e. , larger-@xmath50",
    ", most of the x - ray emission is from the corona , and the transition radius @xmath42 should be smaller , which corresponds a shorter viscous timescale .",
    "we find that @xmath89 is required to reproduce the observations , which is slightly higher than that expected by the adaf model even if @xmath73 ( e.g. , @xmath90 for an adaf , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed discussion ) . the radial velocity of a thin accretion disc with magnetic outflows can be much higher than that of a normal viscously driven disc , if the angular momentum of the disc is removed predominantly by the outflows @xcite .",
    "this mechanism may work in the adaf with magnetic outflows , and therefore its density would be lower than that predicted by the conventional adaf model for a given mass accretion rate , which may lead to a higher critical accretion rate for accretion mode transition .",
    "our present calculations are carried out with @xmath91 for non - rotating black holes .",
    "the radiation efficiency of an accretion disc surrounding a spinning black holes is higher than the non - rotating black hole case .",
    "a higher radiation efficiency for a spinning black hole can be mimicked by tuning the value of @xmath45 .",
    "we find that the results are similar to those reported in figs .",
    "[ eddrat_gam ] and [ rtr_gam ] even if a smaller @xmath45 is adopted .",
    "when the transition radius decreases , more gravitational power is released in the corona , and therefore the x - ray emission from the corona increases , while the emission from the inner adaf decreases .",
    "the total x - ray emission increases with decreasing transition radius , because the radiation efficiency of the outer disc / corona is higher than that of the inner adaf .",
    "the fraction of the x - ray emission from the corona to the adaf increases with decreasing radius , which leads to the observed x - ray spectral index increasing with luminosity , as the x - ray emission from the corona is softer than that of the adaf .",
    "the emission from the thin disc , mostly in optical / uv wavebands , is also expected to increases with x - ray emission .",
    "this is consistent with observations that reveal generally simultaneous long term optical / uv and x - ray variations in agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work ,",
    "the x - ray spectral indices of the adaf and corona are taken as input model parameters , whereas the spectral index of adaf may decrease with increasing transition radius due to the interception of the soft photons from the outer disc by the adaf @xcite . if this effect is included , less fluctuation in transition radius is required to explain the observed x - ray variability .",
    "the timescale of the variability caused by the transition radius is proportional to the black hole mass ( see equation [ tau_vis1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that only the sources with small black holes ( @xmath92 ) will exhibit violent variability in the timescale of @xmath93 year . for those sources containing massive black holes ( @xmath94 )",
    ", the timescale of such variability can be as long as tens or hundreds of years , which may be unpractical as monitoring objects .",
    "the black holes are fed by the circumnuclear gas , and the accretion rate is predominantly regulated by the properties of the gas at the outer radius of the disc .",
    "the timescale of accretion rate changes is much longer than the x - ray variability timescale .",
    "so , the average x - ray flux may correspond to the composite emission from the adaf and the corona connected at the equilibrium transition radius , which may vary with the mass accretion rate as expected by different physical mechanisms for accretion mode transition .",
    "the best - fitting average spectral index - mass accretion rate correlation for the agn sample is roughly consistent with our calculations with @xmath55 ( see equation [ r_tr_mdot1 ] ) , which seems to support the thermal instability triggering accretion mode transition @xcite .",
    "however , it should be cautious on this issue , because the correlation is derived with a sample of only ten sources .",
