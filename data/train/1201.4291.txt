    "the study of large - scale ( complex ) networks , such as computer , biological and social networks , is a multidisciplinary field that combines ideas from mathematics , physics , biology , social sciences and other fields .",
    "a remarkable and widely discussed phenomena associated with such networks is the _ small world _ property .",
    "it is observed in many such networks , man - made or natural , that the typical distance between the nodes is surprisingly small .",
    "more formally , as a function of the number of nodes , @xmath0 , the average distance between a node pair typically scales at or below @xmath5 .    in this work ,",
    "we study the load characteristics of small world networks .",
    "assuming one unit of demand between each node pair , we quantify as a function of @xmath0 , how the maximal nodal load scales , independently of how each unit of demand may be routed . in other words , we are interested in the smallest of such maximal nodal loads as a function of routing , which we refer to as _ congestion _ , that the network could experience .",
    "we show that in the planar small - world network congestion is almost quadratic in @xmath0 , which is as high as it can get , specifically @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , for some non - planar small - world networks , congestion may be almost linear in @xmath0 , namely @xmath3 for arbitrarily small @xmath4 . since congestion in a network with @xmath0 nodes can not have scaling order less than @xmath6 or more than @xmath7 , we conclude that the small world property alone is not sufficient to predict the level of congestion _ a priori _ and additional characteristics may be needed to explain congestion features of complex networks .",
    "this has been argued in @xcite for the case of intrinsic hyperbolicity , which is a geometric feature above and beyond the small world property .    additionally , we investigate what happens to congestion when we change the link metric that prescribes routing .",
    "that is , for a network with edge weight @xmath8 we change the metric by a factor @xmath9 thus assigning each edge @xmath10 a new weight @xmath11 .",
    "we explore the extent to which this change in the metric can change congestion in the network .",
    "we prove that if we allow the weights to get arbitrarily small or large , i.e. when for some edges , @xmath12 approach zero and for some others @xmath12 approach infinity , then considerable changes in congestion can occur . on the other hand ,",
    "if we require the weights to be bounded away from zero and infinity , i.e. when @xmath13 for all edges @xmath10 , then congestion can not change significantly .",
    "these observations quantify the degree to which remetrization in a small world network may be helpful in affecting congestion .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the small world property is ubiquitous in complex networks .",
    "formally we say that a graph has the small world property if its diameter @xmath14 is of the order @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the number of nodes in the graph .",
    "it has been shown that a surprising number of real - life , man - made or natural , networks have the small world property , see , for example , @xcite . to be more specific , assume @xmath16 is an infinite planar graph and let @xmath17 be an arbitrary fixed node in the graph that we shall designate as the root .",
    "let us assign a weight @xmath18 to each edge , thus @xmath19 for all edges @xmath10 , and let @xmath20 be the ball of center @xmath17 and radius @xmath21 .",
    "in other words a node @xmath22 belongs to @xmath23 if and only of @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , we can consider weighted graphs where each edge has a non - negative length .",
    "we will further assume that the sub - graphs @xmath25 have exponential growth , which is clearly equivalent to the small world property , as defined above .",
    "more precisely , there exist @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "assume that for every @xmath21 and every pair of nodes in @xmath25 there is a unit of demand between each node pair .",
    "therefore , the total demand in @xmath25 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 . given a node @xmath32 in @xmath25 we denote by @xmath33 the total flow in @xmath25 routed through @xmath32 .",
    "the load , or congestion , @xmath34 , is the maximum of @xmath35 over all vertices @xmath32 in @xmath16 , which is typically a function of the routing @xmath36 .",
    "the next theorem shows that for a planar graph with exponential growth , there exist nodes with load @xmath1 for @xmath21 sufficiently large regardless of routing .",
    "[ fig1 ]    .",
    "right : flows crossing the boundary separating two planar wedges each with @xmath37 nodes .",
    "note that ( red ) geodesic paths may cross the boundary more than once.,title=\"fig:\",width=220 ] .",
    "right : flows crossing the boundary separating two planar wedges each with @xmath37 nodes .",
    "note that ( red ) geodesic paths may cross the boundary more than once.,title=\"fig:\",width=172 ]    let @xmath16 be an infinite planar graph with exponential growth .",
    "assume one unit of demand between every pair of nodes in @xmath25 .",
    "then for every @xmath21 there exists a node @xmath38 such that @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "fix @xmath21 and let @xmath41 be the spanning tree of all geodesic ( shortest ) paths with the node @xmath17 as the origin , as shown in figure  1 , left . observe that since @xmath16 is small world , all node pairs have distance @xmath5 and thus each ray from @xmath17 in @xmath41 has length thus bounded .",
    "enumerate all the paths in @xmath41 in clockwise order , possible because of the planarity of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 and by the small world property each ray @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 , @xmath45 and in general @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that for all @xmath48 @xmath49 such that @xmath50 and @xmath51 because addition of each @xmath52 adds at most @xmath5 nodes to @xmath53 , and moreover by inequality ( [ eqq1 ] ) we know that @xmath54 let us consider the set @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that all the paths between @xmath56 and @xmath55 have to intersect the path @xmath57 .",
    "the traffic between @xmath56 and @xmath55 is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath59 which satisfies @xmath60 since this traffic has to pass through @xmath57 at some point then there exists at least one node @xmath32 in @xmath57 with load at least @xmath61 ( see figure  1 , right ) proving our claim .",
    "our first claim follows a corollary of the above theorem .",
    "let @xmath16 be an infinite planar graph with exponential growth .",
    "then for @xmath21 sufficiently large there exists a node @xmath38 such that @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a constant independent on @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out that the planarity property is essential for the existence of highly congested nodes proven above .",
    "we now show that in contrast , when @xmath16 is not planar , congestion can be made to approach @xmath6 .",
    "more explicitly , given @xmath64 there exists infinite graphs with exponential growth with uniformly bounded degree such that for every node @xmath38 and @xmath21 sufficiently large , @xmath65 .    before providing such",
    "a construction let us show the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath16 be an infinite graph and let @xmath25 be the ball of radius @xmath21 centered at @xmath66 as before .",
    "assume moreover that @xmath67 .",
    "then for every @xmath38 the following holds @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath70 and define @xmath71 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath72 and moreover @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 where the inequality is coming from the fact that if @xmath75 then the geodesic path between a node in @xmath76 and a node in @xmath77 does not pass through @xmath32 .",
    "hence , @xmath78    we state the following result due to bollobas for completeness .",
    "[ boll ] given @xmath79 for @xmath0 sufficiently large a random @xmath80regular graph @xmath81 with @xmath0 nodes has diameter at most @xmath82 where @xmath63 is a fixed constant depending on @xmath80 and independent on @xmath0 .",
    "now we are ready to show the construction of a small world graph with small congestion .",
    "let @xmath64 and consider @xmath16 a infinite @xmath83-regular tree where the value of @xmath83 will be chosen later .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the root of @xmath16 and @xmath84 as before .",
    "let @xmath85 be the graph constructed by connecting all the nodes in the spheres @xmath86 @xmath87 by a @xmath83-regular random graph for every @xmath88 .",
    "then @xmath89 and it is clear that using theorem [ boll ] we have that @xmath90 note that @xmath91 since we are not adding new nodes .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath92 therefore , using the previous lemma we see that for every node @xmath93 @xmath94 therefore , @xmath95 and hence @xmath96 by taking @xmath83 sufficiently large depending on @xmath4 we see that @xmath65 for @xmath21 sufficiently large .",
    "in @xcite , it has been shown that @xmath97-hyperbolicity implies the existence of a core , that is , a non - empty set of nodes whose load scale as @xmath7 under geodesic routing . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we proved that planar graphs with exponential growth can not avoid congestion of order @xmath1 no matter how the routing is performed . on the other hand",
    ", we observed in section [ sec3 ] that exponential growth alone is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of such highly congested nodes .",
    "thus , unlike the small world property , @xmath97-hyperbolicity is a sufficient condition for a network to have highly congested nodes .",
    "the reverse need not be true , however .",
    "it is not difficult to construct non - hyperbolic graphs in which load scales as @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , two square grids in two vertical planes separated by a single horizontal link joining their origins .",
    "it is even possible to construct small world graphs with @xmath7 load which are not hyperbolic .",
    "let @xmath98 be the 3-regular infinite tree and let @xmath99 .",
    "the graph @xmath16 is not gromov hyperbolic since it has @xmath100 as a sub - graph .",
    "yet , @xmath101 has traffic of order @xmath7 where @xmath66 is the root of @xmath102 .",
    "it is interesting to note that even tough the graph @xmath16 is not hyperbolic , it has @xmath102 as a sub - graph .",
    "examples of small world graphs with load of order @xmath7 appear to include hyperbolic sub - graphs .",
    "we do not know if this is always true but it seems likely since exponential growth implies existence of an exponentially growing tree sub - graph ( e.g. , its spanning tree ) .",
    "we next explore what happens to hyperbolicity when we apply remetrization . more specifically , assume a metric graph @xmath16 where each edge @xmath10 has an associated non - negative distance @xmath103 that satisfies the triangle inequality .",
    "we modify each edge distance by a factor @xmath104 so that the new length of the edge @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "we also require that the coefficients @xmath105 are chosen in such a way that the new edge distances continue to satisfy the triangle inequality and thus constitute a metric .    to determine if @xmath7 scaling of congestion persists after remetrization , let us start with a @xmath97-hyperbolic graph and modify the edge metric according to the above scheme .",
    "does remetrization ensure another @xmath106-hyperbolic graph ?",
    "we show below that this is not the case and thus remetrization can significantly affect the congestion scaling in the graph , unless the weights @xmath12 are bounded away from zero and infinity .",
    "we shall prove the result for regular hyperbolic grids embedded in @xmath108 and then appeal to the quasi - isometry of all @xmath97-hyperbolic graphs with these reference graphs ( see @xcite ) to complete the proof . to simplify exposition ,",
    "we focus on dimension 2 only , since the argument carries through similarly for higher dimensions .",
    "let @xmath109 be a regular tessellation of the poincre disk with @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 may be viewed as a ( hyperbolic ) grid where each node has ( the same ) degree @xmath113 and each face has ( the same ) @xmath114 sides , figure  2 depicts @xmath115 .",
    "note that in the case that @xmath116 the graph @xmath16 is a @xmath113-regular tree and is thus @xmath117-hyperbolic regardless of any metrization .",
    "let @xmath17 be the node at the center of the disk and let @xmath76 be the set of nodes in @xmath16 at distance @xmath83 from @xmath17 .",
    "note that the sub - graph induced by the set @xmath76 is a cycle @xmath118 with @xmath119 nodes .",
    "let us denote this graph also by @xmath76 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that there exists a sequence @xmath120 such that @xmath121 exponentially fast so that if we remetrize every edge in @xmath76 by the constant @xmath122 then the induced graph is not hyperbolic since it will be quasi - isometric to the euclidean grid @xmath123 .",
    "it was observed in @xcite and then proved in @xcite , that the nodes in @xmath124 have congestion of the order @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the nodes in the new graph have a congestion of the order @xmath2 .",
    "we observe that the above construction used arbitrarily small weights .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath64 there are infinitely many weights in this construction such that @xmath126 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the same construction is possible with arbitrarily large weights instead of small weights .",
    "however , if we restrict these weights so that there exist positive constants @xmath83 and @xmath127 such that @xmath128 then the original and the remetrized graphs are indeed quasi - isometric .",
    "therefore , by a result of gromov , see @xcite , if one graph is hyperbolic so is the other and thus @xmath7 is unaffected by the said change of metric .",
