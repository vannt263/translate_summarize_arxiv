    "the transverse momentum @xmath0 of lepton pairs ( or equivalently that of gauge bosons which decay to lepton pairs ) produced in hadron - hadron collisions has been one of the most actively studied variables in qcd phenomenology over several decades . in spite of sustained activity in this area",
    "it remains a subject of vital importance and interest .",
    "an accurate understanding of the production rates and @xmath0 spectra of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 boson can play a role in diverse applications such as luminosity monitoring at the lhc to the measurement of the @xmath1 mass and most importantly perhaps in the search for new physics which may manifest itself for instance in the decay of new gauge bosons to lepton pairs .",
    "moreover such spectra have been a source of considerable information on qcd dynamics .",
    "of particular interest here is the low @xmath0 region where the resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms reflects an understanding of qcd to all orders in the soft / collinear limit .",
    "the low @xmath0 region is also of interest in constraining the non - perturbative `` intrinsic @xmath3 '' which is relevant in many other hadron collider observables .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum is consequently also of immense use in the tuning of monte carlo event generators both for the shower parameters and the intrinsic @xmath3 component .",
    "it is therefore clear that as accurate a measurement of the @xmath0 spectrum as possible is desirable especially at low @xmath0 .",
    "however comparatively large experimental errors have somewhat impacted conclusions about the low @xmath0 region , which have thus not been optimal .",
    "an observable that may offer experimental advantages over the @xmath0 variable has been suggested in ref .",
    "the variable in question is simply the component of the @xmath0 distribution transverse to an axis also defined using the lepton transverse momenta .",
    "this component , called the @xmath4 can be measured more accurately than the longitudinal component @xmath5 and hence than the overall @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "consequently the phenomenology of the @xmath4 variable assumes some importance .    in the current article",
    "we provide one of the most important ingredients necessary for an accurate investigation of the @xmath4 variable over the full range of measured values , the resummation of logarithms in @xmath4 up to the next - to  leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy .",
    "we shall in forthcoming work combine these estimates with fixed - order results and include non - perturbative effects to obtain a state of the art prediction .",
    "the resummation that we carry out involves some important differences from the classic @xmath0 resummation formalism  @xcite , which we explain .",
    "to calculate the @xmath4 distribution at low @xmath4 one first needs to obtain the dependence of the observable on the momenta of soft emitted gluons . denoting the transverse lepton momenta by @xmath7 and @xmath8 we define the `` thrust '' axis as in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath9 considering the emission first of a soft gluon with transverse momentum @xmath3 , one obtains that the @xmath4 with respect to the above defined axis is simply @xmath10 where at nll accuracy we can neglect the order @xmath11 correction , while the usual @xmath0 variable is just given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the angle between the soft gluon and the thrust axis in the plane transverse to the beam . at all orders the above result generalises to @xmath14",
    "the most noteworthy aspect of the above result is that the @xmath4 variable depends on the sum over a _",
    "single _ component of soft gluon momenta ( along say the @xmath15 axis as indicated above ) .",
    "this is different from the @xmath0 variable which at all orders is the two - dimensional vector sum of individual gluon momenta @xmath16 resummed result ---------------    here we quote the nll resummed result for the @xmath4 distribution . as for the @xmath0 , it involves resummation in impact - parameter or @xmath17 space which is the fourier conjugate of @xmath3 space and",
    "the resummed result takes the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the cross - section for events below some fixed value @xmath4 ( i.e the differential cross - section integrated over a limited range from @xmath20 to @xmath4 ) . for simplicity",
    "we have chosen to express our result in moment ( @xmath21 ) space conjugate to @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the mass of the lepton pair and where @xmath24 is the born cross - section .",
    "the function @xmath25 contains the resummation of large logarithms in @xmath17 space and reads @xmath26    r0.5        r0.5        the nll @xmath17 space resummation gives rise to the exponential of @xmath27 , the `` radiator '' , precisely as in the standard @xmath0 resummation .",
    "the difference with the @xmath0 distribution arises from the @xmath28 function that represents the conservation of a single component of transeverse momentum .",
    "this is in contrast to the function @xmath29 that one encounters in @xmath0 resummation , which represents conservation of both components of transverse momentum , relevant in that case .",
    "explicit computation reveals that , within nll accuracy , the radiator @xmath27 in the above case turns out to be identical to that for the @xmath0 variable so all differences are due to the presence of the @xmath30 as opposed to a bessel function .",
    "the term @xmath31 represents a multiplicative correction which can be obtained by carrying out a full leading - order calculation ( here @xmath32 ) .",
    "the main difference of the above result from the @xmath0 distribution will be the absence of a sudakov peak in the final result for the @xmath4 differential distribution with the result continuously rising to a constant value at @xmath33 .",
    "the absence of the sudakov peak is due to the fact that the one - dimensional cancellation of a component of the @xmath34 is the dominant mechanism for producing a low @xmath4 rather than sudakov suppression .",
    "this is not true in the case of the @xmath0 until very low values of @xmath0 beyond the sudakov peak and hence the formation of a peak in that case .",
    "here we compare our predictions to those from fixed order monte carlo computations from the code mcfm @xcite . to this end",
    "we expand eq .   to order @xmath35 .",
    "after noting that the result closely resembles the analogous result for the @xmath0 distribution with the substitution @xmath36 it proves most convenient to provide our predictions for the difference between the distributions for @xmath4 and @xmath37 . up to the two - loop level",
    "we predict for this difference @xmath38 in the above @xmath39 denotes the integrated event fraction for the @xmath0 variable , which is widely available in the literature ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "we can test our resummation for the @xmath4 variable by comparing the above result to the fixed - order computation from the program mcfm . at the leading order in @xmath42 we would expect the difference between the integrated cross - sections for @xmath4 and @xmath37 to tend to a constant at low @xmath4",
    "whose value is predicted in eq .  .",
    "that this is indeed the case can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : lo ] where at large ( positive ) @xmath43 the result from mcfm tends to our expectation .",
    "likewise at nlo accuracy we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo ] the difference between mcfm and the expectation of eq .",
    "( for the differential distribution , i.e.  the derivative with respect to @xmath43 , @xmath44 of eq .  )",
    ". the result should tend to a constant at large @xmath43 and we see evidence for this in fig .  [",
    "fig : nlo ] .",
    "in this article we have provided a resummation of the @xmath4 distribution to nll accuracy .",
    "we have cross - checked our result by checking its expansion against mcfm . in forthcoming work",
    "we shall aim to match the resummed result to fixed - order results from mcfm and include non - perturbative effects in order to have a complete prediction for comparison to experimental data .",
