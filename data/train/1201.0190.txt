    "among the classes of riemannian submanifolds , there is that of willmore surfaces , named after t. willmore @xcite ( 1965 ) , although the topic was mentioned by w. blaschke @xcite ( 1929 ) and by g. thomsen @xcite ( 1923 ) , as a variational problem of optimal realization of a given surface in @xmath0-space .",
    "early in the nineteenth century , s. germain @xcite , @xcite studied elastic surfaces . on her pioneering analysis",
    ", she claimed that the elastic force of a thin plate is proportional to its mean curvature .",
    "since then , the mean curvature remains a key concept in theory of elasticity .",
    "in modern literature on the elasticity of membranes , a weighted sum of the total mean curvature , the total squared mean curvature and the total gaussian curvature is considered the bending energy of a membrane . by neglecting the total mean curvature , by physical considerations , and having in consideration gauss - bonnet theorem ,",
    "t. willmore defined the willmore [ bending ] energy of a compact oriented surface @xmath1 , without boundary , immersed in @xmath2 to be @xmath3 , averaging the mean curvature square over the surface .",
    "the willmore energy `` extends '' to surfaces immersed in a general riemannian manifold @xmath4 of constant sectional curvature by means of @xmath5 the total squared norm of the trace - free part @xmath6 of the second fundamental form .",
    "in fact , given @xmath7 a local orthonormal frame of @xmath8 , gauss equation establishes @xmath9 for @xmath10 the mean curvature vector , @xmath11 the gaussian curvature of @xmath1 and @xmath12 the sectional curvature of @xmath4 . in particular , for surfaces in @xmath13 , the functional defined by @xmath14 shares critical points with the one defined by the total squared mean curvature .",
    "willmore surfaces are the extremals of the willmore functional .",
    "constrained willmore surfaces appear as the generalization of willmore surfaces that arises when we consider extremals of the willmore functional with respect to infinitesimally conformal variations , those that infinitesimally preserve the conformal structure , that is , @xmath15 for the variation @xmath16 of the induced metric ( or rather its complex bilinear extension ) , fixing @xmath17 a @xmath18-vector field ; rather than with respect to all variations .",
    "a classical result by thomsen @xcite characterizes isothermic willmore surfaces in @xmath0-space as minimal surfaces in some @xmath0-dimensional space - form .",
    "constant mean curvature surfaces in @xmath0-dimensional space - forms are examples of isothermic constrained willmore surfaces , as proven by j. richter @xcite . however , isothermic constrained willmore surfaces in @xmath0-space are not necessarily constant mean curvature surfaces in some space - form , as established by an example , presented in @xcite , of a constrained willmore cylinder that does not have constant mean curvature in any space - form .    under a conformal change @xmath19 of a metric @xmath20 , for some function @xmath21 , the second fundamental form @xmath22 of an isometric immersion @xmath23 changes via @xmath24 for @xmath25 the normal projection and @xmath26 the pull - back by @xmath23 of the contravariant form",
    "@xmath27 form of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath20 ( see , for example , @xcite , section 3.12 ) . hence , under a conformal change of the metric , the trace - free part of the second fundamental form remains invariant , so that its squared norm and the area element change in an inverse way , leaving the willmore energy unchanged . in particular",
    ", this establishes the class of ( constrained ) willmore surfaces as a mbius invariant class .",
    "a very well known result ( @xcite ( @xmath29 ) , @xcite , @xcite ( general @xmath30 ) ) characterizes willmore surfaces by the harmonicity of the central sphere congruence . with this characterization",
    ", a zero - curvature formulation of willmore surfaces follows , according to the zero - curvature formulation of harmonicity of a map into a grassmanian by uhlenbeck @xcite .",
    "this characterization generalizes @xcite to constrained willmore surfaces and deformations on the level of harmonic bundles prove to give rise to deformations on the level of surfaces .",
    "the class of constrained willmore surfaces is established as a class of surfaces with strong links to the theory of integrable systems , admitting a spectral deformation , defined by the action of a loop of flat metric connections , as in @xcite , and bcklund transformations , defined by applying a dressing action , as studied in @xcite .",
    "a permutability between the two is established in @xcite .",
    "all these transformations corresponding to the zero lagrange multiplier preserve the class of willmore surfaces .",
    "the isothermic surface condition is known to be preserved under constrained willmore spectral deformation , cf . @xcite . as for bcklund transformation of constrained willmore surfaces , we believe it does not necessarily preserve the isothermic condition .",
    "in contrast , the constancy of the mean curvature of a surface in @xmath0-dimensional space - form is preserved by both constrained willmore spectral deformation and bcklund transformation , for special choices of parameters , with preservation of both the space - form and the mean curvature in the latter case , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this note is dedicated to a self - contained account of the topic in the light - cone picture .",

    "consider @xmath31 provided with the complex bilinear extension of the metric on @xmath32 . in",
    "what follows , we shall make no explicit distinction between a bundle and its complexification , and move from real tensors to complex tensors by complex multilinear extension , with no need for further reference , preserving notation .    throughout this text",
    ", we will consider the identification @xmath33 of the exterior power @xmath34 with the orthogonal algebra @xmath35 via @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "we consider the bundle @xmath38 - and , more generally , any bundle of morphisms - provided with the metric defined by @xmath39 and we shall move from a connection on @xmath32 to a connection on @xmath38 via @xmath40 , with preservation of notation .",

    "our study is one of surfaces in @xmath30-dimensional space - forms , with @xmath44 , from a conformally - invariant view - point . for this",
    ", we find a convenient setting in darboux s light - cone model of the conformal @xmath30-sphere @xcite , viewing the @xmath30-sphere not as the round sphere in the euclidean space @xmath45 but as the celestial sphere in the lorentzian spacetime @xmath46 .",
    "so contemplate the light - cone @xmath47 in the lorentzian vector space @xmath46 and its projectivisation @xmath48 , provided with the conformal structure defined by a metric @xmath49 arising from a never - zero section @xmath50 of the tautological bundle @xmath51 via @xmath52 for @xmath53 , set @xmath54 , an @xmath30-dimensional submanifold @xmath55 which inherits from @xmath46 a positive definite metric of ( constant ) sectional curvature @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath57 non - null , orthoprojection onto @xmath58 induces an isometry between @xmath59 and @xmath60 , whereas , when @xmath57 is null , for any choice of @xmath61 , orthoprojection onto @xmath62 restricts to an isometry of @xmath59 . by construction ,",
    "the bundle projection @xmath63 restricts to give a conformal diffeomorphism @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , choosing @xmath57 time - like identifies @xmath48 with the conformal @xmath30-sphere .",
    "the beauty of this model is that it _",
    "linearises _ the conformal geometry of the sphere .",
    "for example , @xmath65-spheres in @xmath66 are identified with @xmath67-planes @xmath68 in @xmath55 via @xmath69 .      for us , a mapping @xmath70 , of a surface @xmath1 , is the same as a null line subbundle of the trivial bundle @xmath71 , in the natural way .",

    "note that every lift @xmath78 of @xmath72 is conformal .",
    "set @xmath79 independently of the choice of a lift @xmath50 of @xmath72 , defining in this way two complex rank @xmath80 subbundles of @xmath74 , complex conjugate of each other .",
    "the nullity and conformality of the lifts of @xmath72 establish the isotropy of the bundles @xmath81 and @xmath82 , whilst the fact that @xmath72 is an immersion establishes that @xmath81 and @xmath82 intersect in @xmath72 .",
    "we restrict our study to surfaces in @xmath83 which are not contained in any subsphere of @xmath83 .",
    "this ensures , in particular , that , given @xmath84 non - zero , @xmath85 , and we define a local immersion @xmath86 into the space - form @xmath59 , independently of @xmath50 a lift of @xmath72 .",
    "a fundamental construction in conformal geometry of surfaces is the mean curvature sphere congruence , the bundle of @xmath80-spheres tangent to the surface and sharing mean curvature vector with it at each point ( although the mean curvature vector is not conformally - invariant , under a conformal change of the metric it changes in the same way for the surface and the osculating @xmath80-sphere ) . from the early twentieth century , the family of the mean curvature spheres of a surface was known as the central sphere congruence , cf .",
    "w. blaschke @xcite .",
