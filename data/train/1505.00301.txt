    "we are then able to show that the geometric classical correlation decays to a constant value at finite time @xmath4 for decohering processes admitting a pointer basis .",

    "<S> we provide analytical expressions for classical and total trace - norm ( schatten 1-norm ) geometric correlations in the case of two - qubit x states . as an application </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the open - system dynamical behavior of such correlations under phase and generalized amplitude damping evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> then , we show that geometric classical correlations can characterize the emergence of the pointer basis of an apparatus subject to decoherence in either markovian or non - markovian regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as a non - markovian effect , we obtain a time delay for the information to be retrieved from the apparatus by a classical observer . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the set of initial x states exhibiting sudden transitions in the geometric classical correlation has nonzero measure . </S>"
