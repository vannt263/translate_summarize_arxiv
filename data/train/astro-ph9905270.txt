    "the dynamical state of a system of galaxies may be characterized by three intimately related physical quantities : the bolometric x - ray luminosity @xmath7 , the average emission - weighted plasma temperature @xmath8 , and the average dark matter velocity dispersion , @xmath9 ( as traced by the projected velocity dispersion of the galaxies , @xmath10 ) .",
    "there is an observed correlation among these parameters , crudely given by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , and roughly in agreement with the predictions of physical models .",
    "my goal in this letter is to show that the value of the slope @xmath14 at @xmath15 can constrain the spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations , @xmath1 .",
    "one powerful tool for linking the x - ray properties of galaxy systems with the cosmological parameters already exists . the cluster temperature function , which is directly related to the cluster mass distribution , can be used at zero redshift to measure @xmath4 .",
    "henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) analyze data from the einstein satellite to obtain @xmath16 ; data from the rosat and asca missions ( markevitch 1998 ) , corrected for the presence of cooling flows , implies a somewhat steeper @xmath17 .",
    "the redshift evolution of the cluster temperature function can break the degeneracy between the density parameter , @xmath5 , and the normalization of the primordial spectrum ( henry 1997 ) .    here",
    "i introduce a new zero - redshift method .",
    "i suggest that @xmath18 , the slope of the @xmath19 relation , is related to @xmath4 in a way that is complementary to the dependence of the temperature function on @xmath4 .",
    "while it is important to have a flux - limited sample for the temperature function method , using @xmath14 to compute @xmath4 requires only a large number of pointed observations of systems of galaxies . in ",
    "[ sec : derive ] i derive the relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath4 . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] i compare the results with available observations , and discuss possible systematic biases . in ",
    "[ sec : concl ] i summarize .",
    "here i use some of the definitions in the paper by navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ; nfw ) . my results , however , are largely independent of their n - body simulations of dark matter halos , and apply to density profiles different from the one they introduce . eke , navarro , & frenk ( 1998 ) provide a derivation of the @xmath20 relation which is analogous to part of what follows , but does not focus on any cosmological use of @xmath21 .",
    "a spherically symmetric dark matter halo may be characterized by @xmath22 , the radius which encloses 200 times the critical density of the universe , @xmath23 .",
    "the characteristic mass , @xmath24 , is then @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the hubble constant , @xmath5 is the density parameter , and @xmath27 is the redshift .",
    "the halo s characteristic circular velocity is @xmath28 , or , with the substitution of equation ( [ eq : m200 ] ) , @xmath29 now consider a halo density profile of the form , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the halo concentration , @xmath32 is the characteristic density , and @xmath33 is a nonnegative , declining function of @xmath34 . then equation ( [ eq : m200 ] ) requires the following relation between @xmath32 and @xmath31 , @xmath35 in scale - free cosmologies , the characteristic density also depends on @xmath4 , the slope of the initial fluctuation spectrum , because @xmath31 should trace the mean density of the universe at the time of the halo s formation .",
    "nfw use press - schechter theory to examine the exact relationship among @xmath32 , @xmath24 , and @xmath4 .",
    "they find that the characteristic density should be proportional to the mean density of the universe at the epoch when the nonlinear mass @xmath36 is ( 1 ) a fixed and ( 2 ) a very small fraction of the current halo mass .",
    "this implies that @xmath32 should scale with @xmath37 and @xmath4 the same way as the average background density scales with @xmath36 and @xmath4 : @xmath38 the slope of this scaling relation is better than 5% accurate for all @xmath39 cosmologies with either @xmath40 or @xmath41 , where @xmath6 is the cosmological constant in units of @xmath42 . with the substitution @xmath43 and use of equations ( [ eq : m200 ] ) , ( [ eq : vcc ] ) , and ( [ eq : cofc ] ) , @xmath44    next , i compute the circular velocity profile of the halo , @xmath45 . under the transformation @xmath46 , @xmath47 note that the dark matter velocity dispersion profile , @xmath48 , will not in general have the same shape as @xmath49 , contrary to the the assumption in similar derivations ( e.g. eke et al .",
    "rather , the velocity dispersion of the halo is given by the jeans equation for a spherical , nonrotating system of collisionless particles ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath52 is the velocity anisotropy parameter , and @xmath37 is the mass inside the radius @xmath53 . for systems with isotropic velocity dispersion tensors , @xmath54 , and locally @xmath55 . in terms of the previously defined quantities ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : jeans ] ) has the solution @xmath56 finally , consider the average dark matter velocity dispersion , @xmath57 , within the virial radius @xmath22 : @xmath58      the x - ray luminosity of a ball of plasma is @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the bolometric emissivity as a function of the local temperature @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the electron number density , @xmath63 is the ion number density , and the integral is over the entire volume of the system . now",
    "if ( 1 ) @xmath64 , ( 2 ) the system is spherically symmetric , and ( 3 ) the gas density is related to the dark matter distribution by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the gas mass fraction , then @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "substitution of equation ( [ eq : rhodm ] ) yields , @xmath69 now eliminate @xmath22 , @xmath32 , and @xmath23 using equations ( [ eq : rhocrit ] ) , ( [ eq : vcc ] ) and ( [ eq : cofc ] ) : @xmath70    next , note that thermal bremsstrahlung is the dominant cooling process for rich clusters of galaxies ; hence @xmath71 .",
    "then , if the gas is in local hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter , @xmath72 , and hence @xmath73 .",
    "leaving out the constants and substituting equation ( [ eq : sigofr ] ) yields , @xmath74 the integral on the right - hand side is just a number , and may be dropped .",
    "now one must replace @xmath75 , which is not observable , with the projected galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath10 , which can be determined from optical surveys . in the cores of relaxed clusters",
    "@xmath76 is proportional to @xmath57 , the average dark matter velocity dispersion ( equation [ eq : sigav ] ) .",
    "if @xmath66 and @xmath31 remain constant , the above expression reduces to the traditional @xmath78 scaling law from simpler , dimensional arguments ( e.g. , quintana & melnick 1982 ) .",
    "however , equation ( [ eq : vofn ] ) tells us that @xmath31 is a function of the velocity dispersion and the slope of the primordial spectrum .",
    "in fact , once @xmath33 is specified , equations ( [ eq : cofy ] ) , ( [ eq : vofn ] ) , ( [ eq : sigav2 ] ) , and ( [ eq : sigav3 ] ) may be used to eliminate @xmath75 , @xmath31 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , and one may thus obtain the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath10 and @xmath4 . specifically , suppose that within the range of interest for @xmath31 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 exhibit a power law behavior of the form @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ". then @xmath84 where @xmath85      i consider dark matter density profiles of the form @xmath86 .",
    "thus each profile s shape may be specified by a set of three numbers , @xmath87 .",
    "some common profiles and their properties are listed in table [ tbl : profiles ] .",
    "once the set @xmath87 is specified , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are readily computable .",
    "the relevant range of @xmath31 for systems of galaxies comes from measurements of surface number density profiles and of @xmath22 in clusters and groups of galaxies ( carlberg et al .  1997 ; mahdavi et al .",
    "1999 ) . in these works ,",
    "halos with masses in the range @xmath88 have concentrations @xmath89 2.59.5 , in good agreement with n - body simulations ( e.g. , nfw ) . for all sets",
    "@xmath87 in table [ tbl : profiles ] , the power law approximations @xmath82 and @xmath90 are better than 8% accurate everywhere within @xmath912.59.5 .",
    "figure [ fig : xi ] shows @xmath92 from equation ( [ eq : xi ] ) for various profiles . in all cases , @xmath92 is positive , and approaches zero as @xmath93 . as @xmath94 , the models all predict a significant flattening of the @xmath95 relation .",
    "this is understandable through equation ( [ eq : mofn ] ) : the characteristic density @xmath32 is highly anticorrelated with halo mass in the @xmath96 universes , and hence the emission measure increases quite slowly or not at all with mass .",
    "as @xmath93 , @xmath32 becomes nearly independent of the halo mass , and therefore @xmath7 increases rapidly with the velocity dispersion .",

    "for low - redshift clusters of galaxies , @xmath97 with high accuracy . the dependence of the gas mass fraction @xmath66 on @xmath8 and hence @xmath10 is poorly determined .",
    "some , using standard analysis , claim it should increase slightly with @xmath8 ( e.g. , david , jones , & forman 1995 ) ; others say that accounting for cooling flows should cause it to decrease slightly with @xmath8 ( e.g. allen & fabian 1998 ) .",
    "mohr , mathiesen , & evrard ( 1999 ) , in their detailed study of clusters with rosat pointings , find that within 1 mpc @xmath66 is nearly independent of @xmath8 .",
    "because of the range of contrasting findings , i adopt @xmath98 at the 68% confidence level .",
    "there is more agreement among observers regarding the empirical value of @xmath18 : quintana & melnick ( 1982 ) have @xmath99 for data from the einstein satellite ; theirs are 2 - 10 kev luminosities , which scale similarly to bolometric luminosities for rich clusters .",
    "more recently , mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998 ; mz98 ) combined rosat observations of groups and clusters with deep optical spectroscopy to obtain @xmath100 for bolometric luminosities .",
    "i adopt the average value , @xmath101 .",
    "assuming normally distributed errors , the adopted values of @xmath66 and @xmath18 constrain @xmath102 to be @xmath103 at the one - sided 90% confidence level , or @xmath104 at the one - sided 99% confidence level .",
    "figure ( [ fig : xi ] ) shows the @xmath105 boundaries . to accommodate all the models i consider in this scenario ,",
    "@xmath4 must be @xmath106 at 90% confidence level , and @xmath107 at the 99% confidence level .",
    "at least two systematic effects could bias these results .",
    "preheating of the plasma in @xmath108 kev clusters ( ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ) might suppress their luminosities , while leaving those of @xmath109 kev clusters unchanged .",
    "one can avoid this bias by ignoring all clusters with @xmath110 kev .",
    "i find that removing these clusters , which make up @xmath111 of the mz98 sample , does not significantly affect the slope of the observed @xmath112 relation .",
    "also , cooling flows might affect the luminosities . while markevitch ( 1998 ) finds that the slope of the @xmath20 relation does not change as a result of removing cooling flows ,",
    "allen & fabian ( 1998 ) find that @xmath113 changes to @xmath114 after including cooling flows .",
    "the markevitch ( 1998 ) method , which removes the cooling flow altogether , is more appropriate for probing the gravitational potential than the allen & fabian ( 1998 ) method , which includes the luminosity of the cooling component .    to constrain the effect of cooling flows on @xmath18 , i conduct the following test . of the mz98 clusters , 34% are",
    "are also contained in markevitch ( 1998 ) .",
    "i fit @xmath18 for just these clusters , using the @xmath81 which excludes the cooling component .",
    "i find that the slope changes to @xmath115 ; with this , the upper limits on @xmath4 become @xmath116 and @xmath117 at the one - sided 90% and 99% confidence levels .",
    "the chief result of this paper  that if @xmath4 were much greater than @xmath118 , @xmath18 should be @xmath119 instead of the observed value , @xmath120is therefore not affected by the 10% correction due to cooling flows .",
    "if the characteristic densities of clusters of galaxies trace the background density of the universe at the time of each cluster s formation , there should be a relatively simple relationship between the x - ray luminosity @xmath7 , the observed velocity dispersion @xmath10 , and the slope of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath4 .",
    "this relationship , given by equations ( [ eq : final ] ) and ( [ eq : xi ] ) , depends slightly on the density profile of the clustered dark matter , but should not significantly depend on @xmath5 or @xmath6 when applied to low - redshift clusters of galaxies . for a wide range of assumed density profiles ,",
    "the observations imply @xmath121 and @xmath122 at the one - sided 90% and 99% confidence levels , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the bounds from the cluster temperature function , which give @xmath4 between @xmath123 and @xmath124 . improving this constraint depends largely on a better understanding of preheating , cooling flows , and the variation of the gas mass fraction with @xmath10 .",
