    "in our set up a pump laser beam at 355 nm ( triplicated nd - yag q - switched laser ) with 5 ns pulses at 10 hz repetition rate , pumps a type ii 7 mm long bbo crystal , cut for producing collinear degenerate emission .",
    "the traveling wave pdc generates a spatially multimode emission , where each mode corresponds to the transverse component of a specific wavevector .",
    "pairs of correlated modes , corresponding to opposite transverse components of the wavevector with respect to the pump direction , are found in symmetric positions in the far field around the degeneracy wavelength of 710 nm[26 - 28 ] .",

    "the proper sizing of the pixels and the centering of the 2-dimensional array with sub - mode precision , allows maximizing for each pair of pixels the collection of the correlated photons and at the same time minimizing the possible presence of uncorrelated ones [ 27,28 ] .",
    "the photon - number - correlation , even at the quantum level for qi , is realized independently for each pairs of symmetrical ( translated ) pixels belonging to the correlated regions of interests of the twb ( thb ) .",
    "the number of pixel pairs we used is @xmath66 with area @xmath67 .",
    "we underline that spatial statistics for the photon - counting - based qi protocol is completely unnecessary . since qi does not aim an image reconstruction , two conventional photo - counters ( i.e. without spatial resolution )",
    "will be able to accomplish the evaluation of correlation by temporal statistics , and consequently the qi protocol as well . in our proof - of - principle experiment spatial resolving detectors",
    "were employed to have a better control on the statistical properties of the field employed , in order to provide a proper comparison between the experimental data and the theoretical prediction .",
    "the mean number of photons detected per pixel is @xmath68 .",
    "the number of collected spatio - temporal modes is estimated to be @xmath69 by fitting a multi - thermal statistics .",
    "thus , taking into account the overall transmission and detection efficiency ( about 62% [ 27 ] ) , the average number of pdc photons per mode is @xmath70 .",
    "we measured separately the size of the spatial mode , as the fwhm of the correlation function between the two beams , @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the number of spatial modes is about @xmath72 and the number of temporal modes @xmath73 , the last one being consistent with the ratio between the pump pulse duration and the expected pdc coherence time , i.e. 1  ps .",
    "the background field is produced by a pulsed laser scattered by a rotating ground glass disk ( arecchi s disk ) and collimating optics .",
    "the spatial properties at the ccd plane are set to similar value of the pdc emission , while the temporal modes @xmath74 are selected by adjusting the pulse duration and the speed of the disk .",

    "thus , the amount of noise introduced by the background can be increased by boosting its total number of photons @xmath92 or by varying the number of modes @xmath74 , as highlighted from the behaviour of the snr in fig.2,3 and 4 of the main text .",
    "moreover , both twb and correlated thb present locally the same multi - thermal statistics , but with a number of spatiotemporal modes @xmath69 much larger than the one used for the background beam ( @xmath22 in one case and , @xmath93 in the other ) .",
    "this contributes to make the condition of preponderant background effective in our realization , even for a relatively small value of @xmath94 .    however , we point out that all the theoretical curves reported in all the figures are evaluated by the exact analytical calculation of the four order ( in the number of photons ) quantum expectation values appearing on the right hand side of eq .",

    "<S> * 101 * , 253601 ( 2008 ) ] , achieved in a simple feasible experimental scheme based on photon - number correlations . a main achievement of our result is the demonstration of a strong robustness of the quantum protocol to noise and losses , that challenges some widespread wisdom about quantum technologies .    properties of quantum states have disclosed the possibility of realizing tasks beyond classical limits , originating a field collectively christened quantum technologies @xcite . among them , quantum metrology and imaging aim to improve the sensitivity and/or resolution of measurements exploiting non - classical features , in particular non classical correlations @xcite . however , in most of the realistic scenarios , losses and noise are known to nullify the advantage of adopting quantum strategies @xcite . here , we present the first experimental realization of a quantum enhanced scheme @xcite , designed to target detection in a noisy environment , preserving a strong advantage over the classical counterparts even in presence of large amount of noise and losses . </S>",
    "<S> this work , inspired by theoretical ideas elaborated in @xcite ( see also@xcite ) , has been implemented exploiting only photon - number correlations in twin beams and , for its accessibility , it can find widespread use . </S>",
    "<S> even more important , it paves the way to real application of quantum technologies by challenging the common believe that they are limited by their fragility to noise and losses .    </S>",
    "<S> our scheme for target detection is inspired by the `` quantum illumination '' ( qi ) idea @xcite , where the correlation between two beams of a bipartite non - classical state of light is used to detect the target hidden in a noisy thermal background , which is partially reflecting one of the beam . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite it was shown that for qi realized by twin beams , like the ones produced by parametric down conversion , there exists in principle an optimal reception strategy offering a significant performance gain respect to any classical strategy . unfortunately , </S>",
    "<S> this quantum optimal receiver , is not yet devised , and even the theoretical proposal of sub - optimal quantum receiver @xcite was very challenging from an experimental point of view , and has not been realized yet .    our aim is to lead the qi idea to an experimental demonstration in a realistic scenario . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in our realization we consider realistic a - priori unknown background , and a reception strategy based on photon - counting detection and second - order correlation measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the quantum protocol performs astonishingly better than its classical counterpart based on classically - correlated light at any background noise level . </S>",
    "<S> more in detail , we compare quantum illumination , specifically twin beams ( twb ) , with classical illumination ( ci ) based on correlated thermal beams ( thb ) , that turns out to be the best possible classical strategy in this detection framework </S>",
    "<S> .    on the one hand our approach , based on a specific and affordable detection strategy in the context of the current technology , can not aim to achieve the optimal target - detection bounds of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , based on quantum chernoff bound @xcite . on the other hand , it maintains most of the appealing features of the original idea , like a huge quantum enhancement and a robustness against noise , paving the way to future practical application because of the accessible measurement technique . </S>",
    "<S> our study also provides a significant example of ancilla - assisted quantum protocol , besides the few previous realizations , e.g. @xcite .        in our set up ( see fig .  [ setup ] ) parametric down conversion ( pdc ) is exploited to generate two correlated light emissions with average number of pdc photons per spatio - temporal mode @xmath0 , that are then addressed to a high quantum efficiency ccd camera ( see supplementary information , sec.i ) . in the qi protocol ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup]a ) one beam is directly detected , while a target object ( a 50:50 beam splitter ) is posed on the path of the other one , where it is superimposed with a thermal background produced by scattering a laser beam on an arecchi s rotating ground glass . </S>",
    "<S> when the object is removed , only the background reaches the detector . </S>",
    "<S> the ccd camera detects , on different areas , both the optical paths . in the ci protocol ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup]b ) , the twb are substituted with classical correlated beams , obtained by splitting a single arm of pdc , that is a multi - thermal beam , and by adjusting the pump intensity to ensure the same intensity , time and spatial coherence properties for the quantum and the classical sources .    </S>",
    "<S> we measured the correlation in the photon number @xmath1 and @xmath2 detected by pairs of pixels intercepting correlated modes of beam `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' respectively ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setup ] c - d - e ) , @xcite . with our experimental setup , </S>",
    "<S> this correlation can be evaluated with a single image by averaging over all the @xmath3 pixels pairs . </S>",
    "<S> albeit the usage of spatial statistic is not strictly necessary , it is practically effective and allows to reduce the measurement time ( less images needed)@xcite .    in order to quantify the quantum resources exploited by our qi strategy </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a suitable non - classicality parameter : the generalized cauchy - schwarz parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the normally ordered quantum expectation value and @xmath6 the fluctuation of the photon number @xmath7 , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter is interesting since it does not depends on the losses and it quantifies non - classicality : @xmath9 for classical state of light ( with positive glauber - sudarshan @xmath10-function ) , while quantum state with negative / singular @xmath10-function can violate this bound @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ csfig ] we report the measured @xmath11 and the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that for twb @xmath12 is actually in the quantum regime ( @xmath13 ) for small values of the thermal background @xmath14 ; in absence of it ( @xmath15 ) we obtain @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the contribution of the background to the fluctuation of @xmath2 becomes dominant , @xmath12 decreases quite fast , well below the classical threshold . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , for thb @xmath17 is always in the classical regime , and it is equal to one for @xmath18 .     in the case of twin beams , @xmath19 , and of the correlated thermal beams , @xmath20 , as a function of the average number of background photons @xmath21 for a number of background modes </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the estimation of the first order ( mean values ) of the photo - counts distribution , typical of other protocols ( e.g. @xcite ) , is here not informative regarding the presence / absence of the object . we underline that this unknown - background hypothesis accounts for a `` realistic '' scenario where background properties can randomly change and drift with time and space .     </S>",

    "<S> ( [ r ] ) the enhancement is lower bounded by the amount of violation of the cauchy - schwarz inequality for the quantum state considered in the absence of background , i.e. @xmath43 . the equality holds for classical states saturating the classical bound , @xmath44 ( supplementary information , sec.b ) .    in particular , in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> we compared the performance of twb with a classically correlated state with @xmath44 ( hence representing the best possible classical strategy ) , i.e. with a split thermal beams presenting the same local behaviour of the twb . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement can be explicitly calculated obtaining @xmath45 , hence the quantum strategy performs orders of magnitude better than the classical analogous when @xmath46 , namely when a low intensity probe is used .    </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , since covariance is always zero ( i.e. @xmath47 ) when using split coherent beams , they do not provide a valuable alternative in the situation considered here , i.e. when first order momenta are not informative due to unknown fluctuating background .     </S>",

    "<S> the quantum enhancement is almost constant ( @xmath54 ) regardless the value of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the measurement time , i.e. the number of repetitions @xmath56 needed for discriminating the presence / absence of the target , is dramatically reduced in qi ( for instance , to achieve @xmath57 , @xmath25 is almost 100 times smaller when quantum correlations are exploited ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another figure of merit that highlights the superiority of the quantum strategy versus the classical one is the the error probability in the discrimination of the presence / absence of the target ( @xmath58 ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ perr ] we report @xmath58 versus the number of photons of the thermal background @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 is estimated fixing the threshold value of the covariance that minimizes the error probability itself . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ perr ] shows a remarkable agreement between the theoretical predictions ( lines ) and the experimental data ( symbols ) , both for qi and ci strategy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 of qi is several orders of magnitude below the ci one and , in terms of background photons , the same value of the error probability is reached for a value of @xmath21 at least 10 times smaller than in the qi case .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrated experimentally quantum enhancement in detecting a target in a thermal radiation background . </S>",
    "<S> our system shows quantum correlation ( @xmath60 ) even in presence of losses introduced by a partially reflective target . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , even after the transition to the classical regime ( @xmath61 ) due to the presence of background ( @xmath62 ) , the scheme preserves the same strong advantage with respect to the best classical counterpart based on classically correlated thermal beams . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the results are general and do not depend on the specific properties of the background used in the experiment .    in paradigmatic quantum enhanced schemes , often based on the experimental estimation of the first momenta of the photon number distribution , such as quantum imaging protocol @xcite , detection of small beam displacement @xcite and phase estimation by interferometry @xcite , it is well known that losses and noise rapidly decrease the advantage of using quantum light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enforced inside the generic scientific community the common belief that the advantages of entangled and quantum state are hardly applicable in a real context , and they will remain limited to experiments in highly controlled laboratories , and/or to mere academic discussions . </S>",
    "<S> our work breaks this belief showing orders of magnitude improvements compared to ci protocol , independently on the amount of noise and losses using devices available nowadays . in summary , we believe that the photon counting based qi protocol , for its robustness to noise and losses has a huge potentiality to promote the usage of quantum correlated light in real environment .    </S>",
