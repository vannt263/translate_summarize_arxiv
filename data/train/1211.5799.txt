    "during last decades , the interest in diffusive processes has grown tremendously because of their universality in diverse physical areas ; ranging from condensed matter to elementary particle physics and gravitation @xcite . in particular , it has emerged an intense activity in the study of brownian motion in curved manifolds motivated by problems coming from biophysics @xcite . for instance , the lateral diffusion of proteins and lipids occurring inside cell membranes are interesting and complex since they determine the flux of nutrients between the cell and its exterior affecting , in consequence , the cell functionality @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , it is difficult to describe this phenomenon because the interactions with the remaining components of the membrane and the protein finite - size effects @xcite . besides , there are also curvature contributions @xcite and thermal fluctuations that produce shape undulations @xcite coupled to the lateral motion @xcite . and on top of that , protein diffusion is also affected by changing membrane thickness @xcite . the simplest approach to study",
    "this problem is to consider the brownian motion of a punctual particle on a frozen two - dimensional regular surface that represents the membrane @xcite . in this approximation , both thermal shape fluctuations and finite - size effects",
    "have not been taken into account explicitly but as an effective result reflected in the parameters of the model . as discussed below and",
    "although the results presented here are quite general for the brownian motion on a manifold , this work is primarily motivated by the aforementioned transport phenomena .    although the understanding of brownian motion was established a century ago , it is noteworthy to mention that the study of brownian motion on manifolds started three decades ago . since the seminal work of n. g. van kampen @xcite",
    ", the fundamental equations of brownian motion on manifolds were established and the manifolds introduced , like in classical mechanics , as a result of the appropriate canonical transformations involved in the system with certain holonomic constraints .",
    "manifolds also appeared naturally in the dynamics of polymers in solution @xcite , when the polymer is modeled by means of the theory of brownian motion with constraints ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and more recently @xcite for a review ) . in this case , the number of constraints that take into account the bonds between monomers establishes the dimension of the manifold .",
    "however , in a real situation , the rigid constraints represent idealizations of stiff potentials that limit the motion in a certain spatial domain @xcite , whereas by including either thermal or statistical fluctuations the rigid constraints , in general , will no longer represent idealizations of elastic potentials @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , albeit the fluctuations are present , the rigid constraints may emulate real molecular bonds as illustrative toy models and , in some cases , realistic models can be also represented through a coarse - grain or large - scale description , like in the rigid - rod and wormlike chain models @xcite .",
    "in addition , brownian dynamics on curved manifolds becomes a natural framework to study diffusion on crystals with topological disorder , where the torsion of the manifold is crucial to quantify the degree of disorder @xcite .",
    "furthermore , smerlak has found that the eckart s heat flux in general relativity and the generalization of the tolman - ehrenfest relation to non - equilibrium stationary states , as well as gravitational corrections , can be best understood through the mean - square displacements of hypothetic particles in static isotropic curved space - times @xcite .    although the diffusion equation is suited to study the brownian motion of free particles on curved surfaces , a more complete description is provided by the langevin equation .",
    "the latter is based on the newton s equation of motion but including a rapidly fluctuating force , gaussian distributed , representing the interaction among the particle and the solvent .",
    "it is well - known that in euclidean open spaces the mean - square displacement ( msd ) calculated from the langevin equation reproduces the standard einstein kinematical relation . in this kind of spaces , both langevin and diffusion equations",
    "describe the same dynamical behavior at the diffusive time regime , i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the friction coefficient of the solvent , @xmath2 is the particle mass and @xmath3 the momentum relaxation time @xcite . in a curved space , one might ask whether this property is preserved and , in general , what is the dependence of the dynamics on the geometry of the space .",
    "these points have been recently addressed by m. polettini @xcite whom posed a langevin equation , derived by a gauge principle and proved that its overdamped limit corresponds to the diffusion equation in curved manifolds .",
    "we here discuss the aforementioned points , but taking the damped ( @xmath4 ) and overdamped ( @xmath5 ) limits in the msd and look at its behaviour as a function on the geometrical properties of the space .    in this work , we write down the langevin equation for manifolds following the same method introduced by e. j. hinch @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the newton s equation for free particles in a @xmath6-dimensional hypersurface @xmath7 .",
    "free means here that particles do not interact between each other and non external force is acting on them .",
    "nevertheless , they are restricted to move on @xmath7 . for the local momenta @xmath8 and local",
    "coordinates @xmath9 , the resulting langevin equations are , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the riemannian metric tensor and @xmath12 the christoffel symbols .",
    "it turns out that these equations are the same found by kleinert and shabanov @xcite , who discussed its generalization to connections with torsion , as well as those derived in the work of m. polettini using a gauge principle ( invariance under local rotations ) @xcite . besides",
    ", the global version of these equations were obtained by e. j. hinch @xcite for the particular case of two monomers , one of them excessively massive , with one constraint .",
    "we also find that the msd , up to first order in curvature , calculated from ( [ locall-2 ] ) is given by @xmath13\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{2r_{g}}{3}\\left(\\tau_{b}d_{0}\\right)^{2}\\mathcal{j}\\left(t/\\tau_{b}\\right)+\\cdots , \\label{result1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the terms in the square parenthesis are found to be the standard msd for the particle dynamics in the euclidean @xmath14 space and @xmath15 is a non - dimensional function that characterizes the particle dynamics coupled to the curvature ( see below at appendix b for its definition ) .",
    "@xmath16 is the ricci scalar curvature and @xmath17 is the geodesic distance of the general riemannian manifold . taking this equation , we are able to investigate the particle dynamics at different time scales : @xmath18 and for @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is a characteristic time for the positions and momenta relaxation of the solvent molecules , at which the langevin description is not longer valid , and @xmath21 is the time scale when curvature effects become evident .",
    "it is shown that equation ( [ msd0 - 1 ] ) reproduces the same leading curvature effects in the diffusion regime as in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on the diffusion equation on curved manifolds .",
    "the geometrical properties become evident at times @xmath22 much more longer than @xmath21 .",
    "when this happens , the system reaches the thermodynamical equilibrium . in this regime , we reproduce the free - particle dynamics based on the diffusion equation on curved manifolds .",
    "the latter is explicitly compared with our computer simulations . using the well - known result that for compact supports ( @xmath23 ) the spectra of the laplace - beltrami operator , @xmath24 , is discrete .",
    "thus , it is easy to find that the expectation value for any observable @xmath25 in the overdamped limit is , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the first non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath24 and @xmath28 is the volume element of the riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the leading term obtained in this way allows us to determine the steady spacial density @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 the volume of @xmath7 .",
    "this density ( see appendix d ) is consistent with the original calculation performed by kramers @xcite and recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "we explicitly analyze the dynamics of particles confined along a circle , as well as on a sphere .",
    "we test equations ( [ msd0 - 1 ] ) and ( [ obev1 ] ) by means of brownian dynamics computer simulations based on an heuristic adaptation of the ermak - mccammon algorithm @xcite to the langevin equation along curves , as well as on the standard algorithm . in the first case ,",
    "which is here only applied to the circle , the particles are allowed to move in any direction with equal probability , but the geodesic distances they travel are gaussian randomly distributed . in the second case ,",
    "the particles are subjected under the action of a spring - like force field in the @xmath32 ( @xmath33)-dimensional euclidean space , where the corresponding potential , with a ",
    "mexican hat \" shape , has its minima at the same points of the circle ( sphere ) . in the limit case of very stiff springs ,",
    "we get the same results from both numerical routes , and analytical one , as we will see further below . we should mention that the inclusion of a spring - like potential to reproduce the holonomic constrain is a controversial issue because the agreement between theory and simulations establishes a clear example where the particles dynamics with lagrange constraints is equivalent with that using the stiff elastic potential even in systems with fluctuations .",
    "moreover , we should point out that this is not in contradiction with the work done by e. j. hinch @xcite and kampen and lodder @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the single canonical partition function using the stiff potential posed is the same for the single canonical partition function on the circle ( sphere ) in the limit of very stiff springs field , as far as the spring - like constant @xmath34 scales with the square of temperature .",
    "after the introduction , the manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the langevin equation for curved manifolds , written in both global and local coordinates . in addition , we study the curvature effects on the msd at the following time regimes : @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in section iii",
    "we study the particle dynamics on the geometrical regime ( @xmath35 ) by means of the diffusion equation on curved manifolds . in section",
    "iv we explicitly compare the predictions for particles restricted to move along a circle and on a sphere with brownian dynamics computer simulations .",
    "finally , in section v we summarize some concluding remarks and perspectives of our work .",
    "we now specify the basis of langevin dynamics formalism following the method introduced by e. j. hinch @xcite .",
    "it is defined over an euclidean hypersurface @xmath36 , which is represented as the points @xmath37 such that @xmath38 .",
    "the langevin equation needs to include an holonomic constraint in order to bound a point particle on @xmath7 .",
    "let us denote the momentum @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the tangent space at the point @xmath41 , i.e , the position @xmath42 of the particle . from a classical mechanics point of view",
    ", the addition of the term @xmath43 to the free - particle lagrangian allows us to impose an holonomic constraint on @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the resulting equation of motion is @xmath44 and the required constraint is @xmath45 .",
    "we should remark that @xmath46 relaxes the constraint .",
    "then , for the langevin equation defined on @xmath7 , we simply include the previous constraint , a friction term and a stochastic force @xmath47 @xmath48 the second term of the right - hand side of equation ( [ leq1 ] ) represents the force caused by the holonomic constraint .",
    "the stochastic force is chosen such that it satisfies the standard fluctuation - dissipation relations @xmath49 where @xmath50 stands for the average in the _ ensemble _ of forces gaussian distributed over @xmath51 space ( see appendix a ) .",
    "remark that @xmath51 is a copy of @xmath52 , i.e. , the ensemble is given by all possible configurations of forces belonging to @xmath51 .",
    "the stochastic forces can be treated as vector fields in one dimension in the same spirit that zinn - justine introduced them in @xcite .",
    "the lagrange multiplier @xmath53 can be obtained using the constraint ( [ geq3 ] ) as follows .",
    "a time derivative on this constraint implies that @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents derivations in the space @xmath51 .",
    "since the momentum @xmath56 , then @xmath57 is normal to the tangent space .",
    "thus , the normal vector to the surface , i.e. , normal to @xmath58 , is given by @xmath59 .",
    "second derivative on equation ( [ constraint1 ] ) gives @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "now , we get @xmath53 by equating ( [ constraint2 ] ) and the normal projection of ( [ leq1 ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the langevin equation involves a non - linear term proportional to a second power in momenta , @xmath63 and a projector , @xmath64 , that maps a vector @xmath65 into the tangent space .",
    "we point out that the @xmath66 matrix encodes the surface geometry .",
    "for instance , the constraint @xmath67 defines a plane in euclidean space , where @xmath68 is a constant vector and @xmath69 a real number . in this particular case ,",
    "the @xmath66 matrix is zero and the normal vector of the surface is constant , @xmath70 , as it is required for a planar geometry . in the case of a sphere of radius @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 and the normal vector satisfies @xmath73 ; the matrix @xmath66 is given by @xmath74",
    ".    we should remark that the way in which the constraint affects the fluctuating force is through the projector @xmath75 .",
    "in other words , although there is a distribution of forces in @xmath51 for each point of the manifold , the langevin equation ( [ langp ] ) takes into account just those forces tangent to @xmath7 through the projector @xmath75 .",
    "it is also remarkable that for the constrained dynamics , for instance in a numerical routine , the fluctuating forces can be implemented in the same way as it is done for the three - dimensional euclidean spaces .",
    "also , one has to note that the quadratic term in the momentum is not a surprise since the left - hand side of equation ( [ langp ] ) corresponds to the ordinary kinetic term for a particle over a hypersurface .",
    "this means that the langevin equation reduces to the geodesic equation when both the friction and the stochastic force vanish together .",
    "this will be clarified further below when we write down the equation in local coordinates",
    ". we also have to mention that this equation is a particular case of a more general equation derived first by e. j. hinch @xcite within the context of polymers in solution for the case of two monomers , one of them excessively massive , with a single constraint .",
    "in addition , this global description is the natural starting point to introduce ambient interactions , where the extrinsic geometry may play a crucial role .",
    "it is also important to mention that constraints  are merely the result of elastic forces excerted by connecting strings or rods , or other devices by which the free motion is hindered \" @xcite and it would not be the exception for integral proteins or lipids in plasma membranes .",
    "thus , it is natural to ask whether the lagrange constraints are idealizations of elastic potentials when langevin - type of forces are present . to answer properly this question",
    "it would be necessary a careful analysis and it is out from the scope of the paper .",
    "however , following the analysis by n. g. van kampen and j. j. lodder @xcite one can conclude that a constraint system , with langevin - type of forces , could be the limiting case of an equivalent stiff system provided , minimally , that these langevin rapidly fluctuating forces , as well as all the remainder external forces , act upon the particle during a short - time @xmath76 with the requirement that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the stiffness parameter .",
    "for instance , one can choose @xmath20 i.e. , mean collision time of the solvent molecules , for @xmath76 .",
    "in general , as it is observed by e. j. hinch @xcite , it is necessary to introduce an extra _ pseudo - corrective force _ in order to convert the brownian motion of a constrained system into an equivalent very stiff system . in section iv , we test equation ( [ result1 ] ) , which is a consequence of the constrained langevin equation , in the cases of a sphere and a circle using the ermak - mccammon algorithm implemented by a particle immersed in stiff elastic potential .",
    "it will be proved that , in these particular cases , the constrained system is equivalent to that of very stiff potential .",
    "we now provide a description in local coordinates of the langevin equation ( [ langp ] ) . in local",
    "coordinates a hypersurface is parametrized by the mapping @xmath79 , where a particular point in @xmath7 is given by @xmath80 , being @xmath9 the local coordinates ( @xmath81 ) . in such coordinates",
    ", we have @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the local momentum and @xmath86 the tangent vectors ( note that @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus , the first derivative of the momentum is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "the partial derivative @xmath90 can be calculated using the weingarten - gauss equations @xmath91 , where @xmath92 are the components of the second fundamental form @xcite . by using these equations in the momentum time derivative",
    "we obtain @xmath93 the local coordinates version of the langevin equation can be straightforwardly obtained by substituting equation ( [ 1st ] ) into equation ( [ langp ] ) .",
    "hence , the tangent projection takes the form , @xmath94 while the normal projection is given by @xmath95 equations in ( [ locall2 ] ) are the local version of the langevin equation ( [ langp ] ) .",
    "they are the same derived by kleinert and shavanov who discussed the case of manifolds with torsion , see e.g. , @xcite . the same equations were also obtained by m. polettini from the local rotational invariance of wiener increments @xcite .",
    "this gauge invariance is also noted in the distribution of the forces ( [ distribution ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned above , the quadratic contribution in momentum is just the geodesic contribution . the normal projection ( [ normalr ] ) provides a geometrical identity that allows us to derive the extrinsic curvature in terms of the @xmath66 matrix .",
    "this identity is not casual ; it is actually the same found at the level set formulation of differential geometry @xcite .",
    "regarding the fluctuation - dissipation relations , the stochastic forces satisfy the following properties , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the two - dimensional kronecker s delta .",
    "these relations are equivalent to their global version ( see appendix a ) .",
    "based on equation ( [ locall2 ] ) , it is clear that the particle dynamics does not depend on the extrinsic properties of the geometry .",
    "this means that the dynamics on a hypersurface can be studied in a riemannian geometry ; this is what we do from now on .",
    "we are mainly interested on the diffusion mechanisms in the weak curvature regime .",
    "let us recall that if @xmath98 is a local neighborhood of @xmath7 , the map @xmath99 is a local diffeomorphism @xcite , then @xmath100 .",
    "this implies that in a local neighborhood , we should have the same particle dynamics as found in planar spaces ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath101 case ) .",
    "thus , it makes sense to study curvature effects around the euclidean solution .",
    "then , we first review the particle dynamics on the euclidean geometry @xmath102 , i.e. , when the curvature is zero , and , second , we expand the euclidean solution in order to study the leading curvature effects on the particle dynamics over the surface .",
    "in the euclidean geometry , both the global and local descriptions are the same ; the euclidean metric is simply @xmath104 and the chrystoffel symbols are zero . in this case",
    ", the langevin dynamics formalism reduces to the well - known standard equations @xcite @xmath105 and their solution can be written as @xcite , @xmath106 averaging equations ( [ pplanar ] ) over the ensemble of stochastic forces , one easily obtains @xmath107 we observe that the mean momentum decreases exponentially with time ( with the decaying time scale @xmath108 ) and the particle position is shifted by @xmath109 at long - times .",
    "we now consider for simplicity that @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "other physical quantities of interest are the mean quadratic momentum , i.e. , @xmath112 , and the mean square displacement ( msd ) , @xmath113 . in order to calculate both",
    ", it is useful to find the temporal correlation function between two momenta , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , at times @xmath22 and @xmath116 , given by ( see appendix b for further details ) @xmath117.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using previous equation , it is straightforward to obtain the mean quadratic momentum : @xmath118 proceeding along the same lines , one can straightforwardly derive the msd : @xmath119 . \\label{planesol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the diffusive regime , @xmath4 , the average kinetic energy reaches its equilibrium value .",
    "this allows us the evaluation of @xmath120 from the equipartition theorem .",
    "thus , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath124 the absolute temperature .",
    "we also observe that in this time regime the msd reproduces the standard kinematical einstein relation @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the free - particle diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "we should point out that the value of @xmath120 is independent of whether the space is curved or not , since it only depends on quantities intrinsic to the fluid , as solvent friction and particle dimension .    higher order temporal correlation functions are also useful .",
    "in particular , we will see below that the four - point function @xmath127 is necessary in order to obtain the leading curvature corrections .",
    "this correlation function can be computed by using the wick s theorem @xcite , @xmath128      we turn now to the derivation of the leading weak curvature effects on the particles dynamics . as we already discussed , the langevin equation is quadratic in the momentum and that contribution is coupled to the particles positions through the chrystoffel symbols .",
    "the resulting equations are difficult to solve analytically , among other reasons because the left - hand side of equation ( [ locall1 ] ) involves a temporal derivative of the metric . using @xmath85 (",
    "@xmath129 is independent of the metric ) , the local langevin equation allows us to obtain the following expressions , @xmath130    in order to explore curvature effects , we expand equation ( [ sing ] ) around the planar solution ( [ pplanar ] ) . to reach this goal",
    ", we use the riemann normal coordinates @xcite . in normal coordinates",
    ", we have @xmath131 where @xmath132 are the components of the riemann curvature tensor . using ( [ eqrt ] ) in ( [ sing ] ) one obtains @xmath133 we should notice that the langevin equation in euclidean geometries ( [ euclideang ] ) is recovered when the curvature vanishes . in order to find a solution around the euclidean case ( [ pplanar ] ) , we expand the momentum and position in the following way : @xmath134 and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the solutions for zero curvature , given by ( [ pplanar ] ) . here",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath138 and @xmath139 when @xmath140 .",
    "if we consider only linear terms in curvature , we obtain the equation for @xmath141 , @xmath142 the second term of the right - hand side does not depend on @xmath143 ; it depends only on time .",
    "the integration of equation ( [ postime ] ) is similar to the one in the planar case .",
    "the initial condition for @xmath144 is @xmath145 , since @xmath146 satisfies @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the momentum , up to linear terms , in an arbitrary riemannian geometry is given by @xmath148 and the position , up to linear terms as well , takes the form @xmath149 wick s theorem allows us to determine the temporal correlation functions of @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , we have found that the odd correlations vanish , as in the case of the mean values of the momentum and position : @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "this means that there is not preferential points on the surface and the mean values are independent of the geometry .",
    "this result may change however for non - zero initial conditions .",
    "up to linear terms in the curvature , we obtain the following expectation value for @xmath153 @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the same as in equation ( [ planesol ] ) , @xmath156 and @xmath157 the quantity @xmath158 captures the dynamical contribution that appears in the weak curvature regime . in addition , the four - point correlation function @xmath159 is defined according to equation ( [ g4 ] ) ; it is built by the products of two - point correlation functions and each of them carries a kronecker s delta .",
    "hence , using the symmetries of the riemann tensor , the msd reduces to @xmath160 where @xmath16 is the ricci scalar curvature and @xmath161 equation ( [ jexp ] ) can be straightforwardly integrated ( see appendix b ) .",
    "equation ( [ result ] ) represents the msd ( geodesic mean square displacement ) in the weak curvature regime .",
    "as we can appreciate from equation ( [ jexp ] ) , the time scale @xmath108 defines two time regimes : the one with @xmath162 ( but very much larger than @xmath20 ) or the ballistic regime , and the one with @xmath4 called the diffusive regime . in the first case , the msd is given by @xmath163 the cubic term is the ordinary contribution to the ballistic regime when the initial condition is @xmath110 ( it becomes quadratic in @xmath22 for non - zero initial conditions @xcite ) .",
    "the next curvature contribution is of order @xmath164 ; typically negligible unless there is a region of very high curvature . in the diffusive regime , @xmath4 ,",
    "the function @xmath165 reduces to @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , the msd becomes @xmath167 this result is the same found by one of us @xcite by means of the diffusion equation on curved manifolds .",
    "the msd shows a deviation from the planar result due to curvature effects .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ msdcurv ] ) also shows the raise of two different diffusive regimes : the one with @xmath19 , and the overdamped regime , also called geometric regime , @xmath35 . here , @xmath168 stands for the time thereafter the curvature effects become dominant and it is the regime when the equilibrium is reached .",
    "this result is a confirmation that the langevin equation describes the same dynamics of the diffusion equation on curved manifolds in the diffusive regime .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that this result has been recently obtained , using alternative methods , by m. polettini @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that in the planar case , i.e. , @xmath169 , the particle can not feel any effect associated with the geometry ( @xmath21 is never reached , then it grows towards infinity ) .",
    "additionally , we should emphasize that in the particular case of @xmath170 the msd may exhibit deviations from the planar result that can not be associated to @xmath16 , since the gaussian curvature of lines is zero .",
    "in fact , as we will see further below , those effects are associated with the finite - size of the phase space .    from now on",
    ", we use the fact that langevin equation and diffusion equation on curved manifolds describe the same dynamics in the diffusive and geometric regime . in the following section",
    ", we explicitly discuss some properties of the diffusive motion of the particles along a circle , @xmath171 , and on a sphere , @xmath172 .",
    "we now choose the diffusion equation in order to study the geometric regime ( @xmath173 ) in the manifolds @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( for a discussion on the diffusion on arbitrary hyperspheres see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the diffusion equation on curved manifolds can be written as , @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the probability of finding the diffusing particles in the volume element @xmath176 , given that they began to move at @xmath177 .",
    "the probability density distribution @xmath178 is normalized with respect to the volume @xmath31 of the manifold and @xmath179 is the free - particle diffusion coefficient .",
    "the operator @xmath24 , called the laplace - beltrami operator , is defined by @xmath180 with @xmath181 and @xmath182 is a scalar function .",
    "the geometry is coupled to the brownian motion through the metric .",
    "it is clear that @xmath178 reaches a constant value when the system is under equilibrium conditions , i.e. , @xmath183 .",
    "the diffusion equation ( [ difeq ] ) is the same as the heat kernel equation and it has a lot of applications in the context of field theories on curved spaces @xcite .    the expectation value of a scalar function @xmath25 defined on the manifold is given in the standard fashion , i.e. , @xmath184 and @xmath185 depends on the initial point @xmath177 .",
    "the characteristics of observables in manifolds are related with the particular structure of @xmath178 . besides",
    ", the probability density distribution @xmath178 can be determined by solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenfunction @xmath188 .",
    "in addition , it is known that for compact manifolds , the spectra of @xmath24 is discrete and it can be written in a growing sequence @xmath189 , where @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "we also have a sequence of orthogonal eigenfunction @xmath191 in @xmath192 ( square - integrated functions of @xmath7 ) . in this sense",
    ", the probability density distribution can be formally written as @xcite @xmath193 with @xmath194 being the complex conjugate of @xmath188 .",
    "we note that degeneracy of eigenvalues is explicitly considered in the sum .",

    "its dynamical behavior can be obtained using the formal expression for @xmath178 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath185 has a generic form ; its structure around the geometric regime is determined by the smallest eigenvalues .",

    "this method , which has been adapted in euclidean coordinates , was derived from the langevin equation and became consistent with the fokker - planck equation .",
    "furthermore , such a method can be straightforwardly applied when either hydrodynamic interactions are considered explicitly or external forces act on the particles .",

    "the hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) are included through the diffusion tensor @xmath251 , @xmath252 is the total force exerted on the @xmath253-th particle and the index @xmath254 tells us that the variable must be calculated at the beginning in time at every step .",
    "the term @xmath255 represents a random displacement with a gaussian distribution function with mean value zero and a covariance matrix given by the elements @xmath256 ; these are the requirements needed to satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( [ fluc - dissip ] ) .",
    "the indices @xmath257 and @xmath253 run over the particles , and the indices @xmath258 and @xmath259 over the cartesian coordinates . in our case",
    ", we do not consider hi and , therefore , @xmath260 , where @xmath179 is again the free - particle diffusion coefficient .",
    "with this assumption , the second term in the right - hand side of equation ( [ eermak ] ) disappears and allows us to simplify drastically the calculation of the third and fourth terms of the same side .    as we mentioned previously , the algorithm of ermak and mccammon describes the temporal evolution of euclidean variables .",
    "however , it can be still used to describe the dynamics of particles on curved surfaces .",
    "this can be done by considering an external field that constrains the movement of the particles on the surface .",
    "we demand that the force coming from such a field does not contribute to the tangent displacements of the particles , i.e. , this force has to act normal to any point of the desired manifold ( i.e. @xmath171 or @xmath172 ) at any time to guarantee that it does not perform work on the system .",
    "then , the simplest vector force - field that satisfies such requirements can be written as @xmath261 where @xmath34 is a coupling constant , whose value is chosen in such a way that the particle displacements in the perpendicular direction to the surface is basically negligible , @xmath71 is a parameter of this force that we identify , here , with the radius of either the circle or the sphere and @xmath262 is a unit normal vector .",
    "this force can be thought as a spring - like force that attach the particle to a domain near the surface ; in this sense @xmath34 is a spring - like constant . in the two - dimensional case",
    ", this vector field can be explicitly visualized in figure ( 3 ) , where the circle ( solid line ) shows the separation of the plane in two regions defined by the sign of @xmath263 .",
    "[ fig41 ]   separates the plane in two regions depending on the sign of the vector force - field @xmath264.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ] +    it is also convenient to determine the potential energy associate to this force .",

    "mexican hat \" shape . in figure",
    "( 4 ) , we plot the potential given by equation ( [ potential ] ) for the 2-dimensional case , where the points that minimize the potential correspond to the manifold ( in this case @xmath171 ) .",
    "[ fig31 ] ) has a ",
    "mexican hat \" shape , whose minima are the points of the manifold @xmath171 .",
    "the value of the coupling parameter , @xmath34 , controls the width of the well.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    before we implement the external force ( [ forcer ] ) in the ermack - mccammon algorithm , let us provide two arguments that will help us to understand why it will reproduce the correct dynamics on either the circle or the sphere in the limit of very stiff potential , i.e. @xmath266 .",
    "we analyze this limiting process by choosing the situation within the context of the classical mechanics and statistical mechanics .",
    "thus , in the former case , we have a classical system consisting of a particle subjected to the vector force - field given by ( [ forcer ] ) .",
    "following n. g. van kampen and j. j. lodder @xcite the motion of the particle will not have rapid vibrations in the normal direction of the surface , as far as the force acting upon the particle , that initiates its movement , vary smoothly during a short - time @xmath76 and when the condition @xmath267 is entirely satisfied . under this assumption the result , as kampen and lodder pointed it out , is that the particle motion will be along the surface ( in this case either @xmath171 or @xmath172 ) .",
    "now , by using a statistical mechanics analysis , we perform the calculation of the single canonical partition function of the particle subjected to the external field and we compare it with the corresponding partition function on the sphere . on one hand ,",
    "the latter partition function is given by @xmath268 where @xmath269 and @xmath270 is the de broglie wavelength ( see the appendix d for a derivation of this equation ) .",
    "on the other hand , the partition function for the particle subjected to the potential ( [ potential ] ) , after we integrate out the momenta , is given by @xmath271 where @xmath272 is some adimensional constant that does not change the physics .",
    "naively , it is expected that for large values of @xmath34 the only admissible value for @xmath273 should be any position @xmath274 with length @xmath275 leading to the effect of confinement on the sphere . however , this intuition is approximately correct because when temperature increase , the confinement effect would disappear .",
    "thus , the only way to maintain this confinement is scaling the value of the coupling constant @xmath34 with temperature in such a way that the particles are maintained on the sphere .",
    "indeed , this happens as we show in the following .",
    "using polar coordinates and performing several change of variables , last integral can be written as @xmath276 where @xmath277 .",
    "last integral can be perfomed exactly in terms of the error function ( see appendix d ) and for large value of @xmath34 it has an asymptotic value that goes to @xmath278 , therefore the partition function for @xmath266 is given by @xmath279 this means that the only way that this partition function converges to the one on the sphere ( @xmath280 ) is such that the coupling @xmath34 grows with temperature as @xmath281    the limit of large value of @xmath34 can be performed for a fixed temperature taking the adimensional constant @xmath282 .",
    "therefore , taking this scaling law for the coupling constant @xmath34 , we have that @xmath283 .",
    "thus , with these arguments in both classical mechanics and statistical mechanics we are confident that at least in these two extremal situations we can control the confinement effect of the particles on the surface by means of the stiffness parameter .    hence , equation ( [ forcer ] ) is incorporated in the standard algorithm for brownian dynamics described in equation ( [ eermak ] ) to analyze the diffusion on the given surface .",
    "we should mention that the addition of force ( [ forcer ] ) into equation ( [ eermak ] ) has the same effect on the particle dynamics as the second term of the left - hand side in equation ( [ langp ] ) , i.e. , it only constrains the motion of the particles on the manifold .",
    "thus , this kind of trick allows us to study the diffusion on curved surfaces ( at least on @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) through the use of the standard ermak and mccammon algorithm .",
    "it is noteworthy to mention that according to e. j. hinch @xcite in order to convert the brownian motion of a rigid system to an equivalent very stiff system we have to add a _ pseudo - corrective _ force , @xmath284 , to the equation of motion . in the case of our interest , if we want to convert the brownian motion of a very stiff system to an equivalent rigid system one would have to apply a force opposite to @xmath284 . in the particular case of the sphere ( similar for the circle )",
    "this force is given by @xmath285 ( see appendix d for details ) .",
    "the correction term would be @xmath286 which does not have any contribution in the particular cases of sphere and circle .",
    "similar result , is indeed , already found by grassia , hinch , and nitshe for the brownian motion on an ellipse in @xcite . in our brownian dynamics simulations , we have used @xmath287 free particles , a reduced time step @xmath288 and a reduced stiffness parameter @xmath289 .",
    "we also use @xmath290 time steps to reduce the statistical uncertainties .",
    "thus , the msd from the adaptation of the standard algorithm of ermak and mccammon is shown in figures 1 and 2 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eermak ] ) takes the simple form @xmath291 for free particles , with @xmath292 . in a @xmath6-dimensional euclidian open space",
    "this process is equivalent to allow the particles to move in any direction with equal probability , as long as the distances they travel are gaussian randomly distributed with variance @xmath293 .",
    "this is however the short - time behavior of the msd in @xmath6-dimensional manifolds ( [ msdcurv ] ) .",
    "hence , we heuristically extend the ermak and mccammon algorithm to curved manifolds by allowing the particles to move in any direction with equal probability , but the geodesic distances they travel are gaussian randomly distributed , i.e. , @xmath294 with @xmath295 , as long as @xmath296 .    in the particular case of a circle , this idea leads to the following algorithm : a uniform random number is generated in the interval @xmath297 $ ] ; the particle in turn is allowed to move in the clock - wise direction if the result falls in @xmath298 $ ] , otherwise the particle moves in the opposite direction ; a gaussian randomly distributed number with variance @xmath299 is then generated in order to determine the arc - length the particle travels ; these steps are repeated for every particle , many times , in order to construct the dynamics of the system in its natural sequence . in our simulations",
    ", we let 1000 free particles to move in very short time steps , until they approximately cover a distance of 100 times the perimeter of the circle .",
    "the large number of particles allows to improve the numerical precision of our results .",
    "we expect , on the one hand , the short - time behavior @xmath300 , since this is included in the construction of the algorithm . on the other hand , for very long times ( @xmath200 )",
    "the particles has to distribute uniformly along the perimeter of the circle .",
    "therefore , the geometric behavior of the msd must be given by the simple average of the geodesic square displacement @xmath301 which agrees with equation ( [ msdcirculo ] ) .",
    "these and the intermediate values of @xmath302 are shown in figure 1 .    the extension of these ideas to the general case of curved surfaces will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in this work the diffusion of free particles on curved surfaces is studied .",
    "after writing the langevin equation and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for curved surfaces , we solved the former in the riemann normal coordinates for weak curvatures , i.e. , up to linear terms in the riemann curvature tensor . from this solution ,",
    "the dynamics of the particles can be clearly separated in three regimes ; the ballistic one , @xmath303 , and two diffusive regimes ; short times , @xmath304 , and long times , or geometric regime , @xmath305 . in the ballistic regime we find effects of the geometry up to order of @xmath164 typically negligible unless there is a region of high curvature .",
    "we therefore conclude that , typically , the local dynamics occurs in the plane tangent to the surface .",
    "nevertheless , in the long - time diffusive regime only the geometric effects take place .",
    "the free particle diffusion coefficient @xmath179 might be understood in terms of the short - time limit of the mean geodesic square displacement , @xmath306 , in a similar way as in the case of interacting particles .",
    "the geometry then appears as an external force acting on the diffusing particles , which can be recognized in the second term of the left side of equation ( [ langp ] ) .",
    "we should remark that in the short - time diffusive regime the langevin equation was found to have the same solution as the diffusion equation on curved surfaces @xcite , as it is expected and consistent with a work of m. polettini @xcite .",
    "we therefore used the latter in order to study the whole diffusive dynamics of free particles along a circle , @xmath307 , and over a sphere , @xmath308 .",
    "we do not expect curvature effects in @xmath307 since its gaussian curvature @xmath309 is zero .",
    "however , the msd displays a geometric diffusive regime due only to confinement effects , since the particles are unable to move beyond the region where the circle is placed . in @xmath308",
    "the confinement and curvature effects act together to define the geometrical regime .",
    "the difference between curvature and confinement effects is subtle and somehow counterintuitive .",
    "this will be carefully reported somewhere else .",
    "we also reported some results from brownian dynamics computer simulations .",
    "we obtained them by implementing the standard ermak - mccammon algorithm , as well as its heuristic adaptation to curves . in the first case",
    ", we assumed that the particles are subjected to an external field that constrains the movement of the particle to the surface .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath34 can be thought as a spring - like constant that is adjusted to guarantee the particle dynamics very close to the surface .",
    "a particular test of this field was made on the ground of statistical mechanics by calculating the single canonical partition function of the particle in the field and compare it with the corresponding partition function on @xmath172 .",
    "it is found a curious effect , that may be experimentally tested , that the only way to maintain the confinement effect to the spherical surface is scaling the value of the coupling constant @xmath34 with temperature in a precise way . in the second case , which was only applied to the circle , we allowed the particles to move in every direction along the curve , every time displacing geodesic lengths given by random gaussian number with variance @xmath310 .",
    "the quantitative comparison of the theoretical results with the simulation data was shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "our approach can be extended in various directions .",
    "we could study the case of interacting particles where interaction may produce colored distributions for the stochastic forces in the langevin equation @xcite , so that wick s theorem , which is of central importance in our calculations , were not longer valid .",
    "nevertheless , it could be longer applied as an approximation , in the sense that the @xmath311-time correlation functions may be decomposed in terms of two - time correlation functions .",
    "in addition , both implementations of the ermak and mccammon algorithm may be further used for interacting particles , as well as for other physical circumstances .",
    "for instance , the rotational brownian motion of molecules can be studied by a diffusion equation on a manifold . for the case of the lateral diffusion of a protein or lipid we did not take into account the effects of the thermal fluctuations of the membrane and on top of that the finite size of these particles could involve local deformations on the membrane that can change the diffusion constant . furthermore",
    ", it could be interesting from the theoretical viewpoint to investigate if there are other ",
    "realistic \" circumstances where lagrange constraints represent idealization of a very stiff potential .",
    "the stochastic force is gaussian distributed for each point on the surface @xmath312 . in global coordinates this distribution is given by @xcite @xmath313\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\omega}\\int^{t}_{0 } d\\tau ~\\delta^{ij}f_{i}\\left(\\tau\\right)f_{j}\\left(\\tau\\right)\\right\\ } , \\label{distribution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath314 $ ] is an appropiate functional measure .",
