    "a number of proposed experiments like the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) aim to directly image the scattered and emitted light from extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "these experiments will also excel at detecting exozodiacal dust , circumstellar dust analogous to zodiacal dust in our solar system ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "zodiacal dust in the solar system consists of @xmath4 m dust grains released through asteroidal collisions and the outgassing of comets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this dust forms the zodiacal cloud , extending from the solar corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to beyond jupiter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our zodiacal cloud exhibits several structures interpreted as dynamical signatures of planets @xcite .",
    "several dusty disks around nearby main - sequence stars show similar structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this trend suggests that exozodiacal clouds may be full of rings , clumps and other asymmetries caused by planets and other phenomena .",
    "this situation raises some important questions .",
    "will the structures in exozodiacal clouds be harmful astrophysical noise for direct imaging of extrasolar planets @xcite ? or can the dynamical signatures of planets in these clouds help us find otherwise undetectable planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several studies have examined the geometry of resonant signatures of planets in debris disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , most simulations can not quantitatively study the contrast in these structures : how bright they are relative to the background cloud .",
    "we need to model the contrast of the structures in exozodiacal clouds to understand their roles as astrophysical noise and as signposts of hidden planets .",
    "however , accurately simulating the contrast of these structures demands computational resources that have only recently become available ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine the contrast of resonant structures induced by planets in steady - state exozodiacal clouds and the detectability of these structures via direct imaging .",
    "we simulate high - fidelity images of collisionless exozodiacal clouds containing a terrestrial - mass planet  an exo - earth or super - earth . by using roughly an order of magnitude more particles than most previous simulations",
    ", we overcome the poisson noise associated with constructing histograms of the column density and populating the external mean motion resonances ( mmrs ) of planets .",
    "we use our simulations to estimate the minimum planet mass that can be indirectly detected via observations of these structures as a function of the planet semi - major axis and dominant grain size under the assumption of circular planet orbits .",
    "our models apply to exozodiacal clouds less than a few hundred times the optical depth of the solar zodiacal cloud , clouds for which the collision time is shorter than the poynting - robertson ( pr ) time for typical grains .",
    "section 2 of this paper describes our numerical techniques .",
    "we present a synthetic catalog of resonant debris disk structures in section 3 .",
    "we describe our multiple - particle - size cloud models and discuss their detectability in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the limitations of our simulations ; we summarize our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "dust grains in the inner solar system are primarily released from parent bodies via collisions or outgassing .",
    "radiation pressure ejects the smallest particles from the solar system in a dynamical time while the larger particles slowly spiral inward due to pr drag @xcite . during their spiral toward the sun , particles may become temporarily trapped in the mmrs of planets , extending their lifetimes by a factor of a few to ten @xcite .",
    "this trapping locally enhances the particle density , creating structures within the zodiacal cloud , which have been described as circumsolar rings , bands , and clumps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to model these types of structures in exozodiacal clouds we numerically integrated the equation of motion of dust particles .",
    "the equation of motion for a perfectly absorbing particle orbiting a star of mass @xmath5 is given to first order in @xmath6 by @xcite :    @xmath7,\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the heliocentric position and velocity of the particle and @xmath10 is the ratio of solar wind drag to pr drag .",
    "we assume a value for @xmath10 of 0.35 @xcite .",
    "for perfectly absorbing spherical particles in the vicinity of the sun , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass density of the particle in @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the radius in @xmath15 .",
    "we implemented a customized hybrid symplectic integrator to perform our numerical integrations .",
    "@xcite , hereby referred to as , introduced hybrid symplectic integration as a method for dealing with close encounters in an efficient n - body code .",
    "symplectic integrators rely on splitting the hamiltonian into two easily integrable portions  a dominant term , @xmath16 , and a smaller perturbative term , @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the n - body problem , @xmath17 may exceed @xmath16 during close encounters .",
    "hybrid symplectic integrators overcome this problem by effectively switching from a symplectic integrator to an alternate integrator ( e.g. bulirsch - stoer ) .",
    "the hybrid method reduces the perturbative term of the hamiltonian , @xmath17 , by a factor @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the distance between the two bodies in question , to ensure that the perturbative term remains relatively small .",
    "the integrator includes the remaining portion of the perturbative term , @xmath20 $ ] , in the dominant term which is then integrated using a method of choice .",
    "the  changeover function , \" @xmath18 , is a smooth function that varies from 0 for @xmath21 to unity for @xmath22 .",
    "using a hybrid integrator requires choosing a changeover function and a value for @xmath23 .",
    "we use the same changeover function as .",
    "we assign a different value of @xmath24 to each body , calculated as the larger of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the hill radius and velocity of the @xmath29 body , respectively , and @xmath30 is the time step of the integrator .",
    "we then calculate the critical distance for a pair of bodies as @xmath31 = @xmath24 + @xmath32 .",
    "our integrator also incorporates the effects of radiation pressure , pr drag , and solar wind drag .",
    "we implement radiation pressure as a correction to the effective stellar mass ( cf .",
    "eq . 1 ) and treat the drag effects as an additional term in @xmath17 , in much the same way as @xcite , hereby referred to as",
    ". we also use democratic heliocentric ( dh ) coordinates , composed of the barycentric momenta and heliocentric positions , because of their relative ease of implementation .",
    "this choice introduces an additional perturbative term to the hamiltonian due to the motion of the star with respect to the barycenter @xcite .",
    "we checked our integrator using a variety of standard tests .",
    "we checked the energy and jacobi constant conservation with the drag terms turned off and examined the evolution of dust particles orbital elements under our implementation of drag effects .",
    "we also compared our hybrid integrator to a bulirsch - stoer integrator by examining the path of an individual test particle during a close encounter and by examining the statistics of a cloud of particles in a collisionless disk containing a planet .",
    "we tested energy conservation in our integration code by integrating the orbits of the four outer planets and the sun for @xmath33 years using a time step of 0.15 years .",
    "the energy error was bounded with a mean value of @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite , which we will refer to as , tested the relative conservation of energy in their symplectic integrator as a function of planet perihelion distance .",

    "we initially placed jupiter at aphelion .",
    "figure [ energyvsperi ] also shows the results of integrating the orbits of jupiter and saturn under the same conditions . with the dh method",
    ", the perturbative solar term increases as the perihelion distance of the planet decreases , causing the fractional energy error to increase similarly .",
    "the fractional energy errors shown in figure [ energyvsperi ] agree with those obtained by .",
    "we checked the conservation of the jacobi constant by integrating particles in the sun - neptune system .",
    "we found results consistent with those of .",

    "figure [ aevst ] shows the semi - major axis and eccentricity as functions of time .",
    "these results match the results of and agree with the analytic solution @xcite .",
    "we tested the performance of our hybrid scheme by integrating the orbit of comet p / oterma in a close encounter with jupiter , which has been done previously by @xcite and .",
    "the initial conditions for both bodies can be found in table 3 of @xcite .",
    "figure [ comettrajectory ] shows the path of comet p / oterma for several values of integration time step @xmath30 as seen in the frame co - rotating with jupiter , which is located at the origin .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained by .",
    "our code shows a minor improvement over the other codes , most noticeable in the @xmath39 days case , that is likely only due to differences in the calculation of the changeover distance .",
    "explicitly sets @xmath40 for this test ; we used our prescription for @xmath23 as described in section [ hybridsymp ] .",
    "we directly compared simulations of resonant structures made with our hybrid integrator to simulations made with a bulirsch - stoer integrator . during the integrations we recorded the coordinates of each particle in a 2-d histogram at regular intervals",
    ". this histogram models the surface density distribution in a steady - state cloud .",
    "since we only modeled planets on circular orbits , we simply recorded the coordinates in the frame co - rotating with the planet .",
    "this technique has been widely used by dust cloud modelers @xcite .",
    "figure [ bsvshybrid ] shows two histograms , one for each integrator , for simulations of 1,000 particles each in the presence of the sun / earth system .",
    "we used a histogram bin width of @xmath41 au .",
    "for these simulations we chose @xmath42 and initially released the particles with semi - major axis , @xmath43 , distributed uniformly between 3 and 5 au , eccentricity , @xmath44 , uniformly distributed from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , and inclination , @xmath47 , uniformly distributed between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we used a symplectic time step of 0.02 years and recorded the particle locations every 250 years .    except for a small number of pixels ,",
    "the middle panel of the figure ( simulation using the hybrid integrator ) looks qualitatively very similar to the left - most panel ( simulation using the bulirsch - stoer integrator ) .",
    "the right panel of figure [ bsvshybrid ] shows the difference of these two images divided by the @xmath50 poisson noise expected for each pixel where @xmath51 is the number of particles in the pixel .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the differences between the two models are nearly consistent with the poisson noise of the histograms .",
    "the two integrators resulted in histograms with minor structural differences , but the hybrid symplectic integrator runs a few times faster .    besides pixel - to - pixel poisson noise in the histogram , this method is also sensitive to noise in the population of mmrs",
    ". showed that the population of the dominant resonances varied by a factor of @xmath52 among sets of 100-particle simulations of kuiper belt dust interacting with neptune .",
    "this noise probably causes the differences between the two simulations shown in figure [ bsvshybrid ] beyond those attributable to pixel - to - pixel poisson noise . although simulations of 100 particles may acquaint us with the generic geometry of debris disk structures , we can not use them to predict ring contrasts ; to model the contrast in a resonant cloud feature we must include enough particles to accurately populate the mmrs .",
    "we solved this problem by using more particles .",
    "we used the 420-processor thunderhead cluster at nasa goddard space flight center to perform simulations of 5,000 particles each .",
    "figure [ mmrs ] shows the population of mmrs for three independent 5,000-particle simulations of the sun and four outer planets using the same initial conditions as .",
    "simulating 5,000 particles reduced the difference between mmr populations for the three simulations to less than 7% for the dominant 2:1 and 3:2 mmrs , allowing us to synthesize high - fidelity images and quantitatively study the resonant ring structures .",
    "to explore the range of different types of structures formed by terrestrial - mass planets , we performed 120 simulations of dust interacting with single planets on circular orbits .",
    "the simulations used 5,000 particles each and covered six values of planet mass , @xmath53 ( 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 5.0 @xmath54 ) , four values of planet semi - major axis , @xmath1 ( 1 , 3 , 6 , and 10 au ) , and five values of @xmath2 ( 0.0023 , 0.0073 , 0.023 , 0.073 , and 0.23 ) corresponding to spherical silicate particles ranging in radius from @xmath55 .",
    "we released the particles on orbits with semi - major axes uniformly distributed between 3.5 and 4.5 times the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit  well outside of the strongest mmrs .",
    "we used initial eccentricities uniformly distributed between 0 and 0.2 , initial inclinations uniformly distributed between 0 and @xmath56 , and the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath57 , and the argument of pericenter , @xmath58 , uniformly distributed between 0 and 2@xmath59 .",
    "we considered planet semi - major axes of 1 to 10 au because typical designs for tpf can detect an exozodiacal cloud with 10 times the optical depth of the solar zodiacal cloud over roughly that range of circumstellar radii @xcite .",
    "we chose these initial conditions to model only dynamically - cold dust , i.e. @xmath60 and @xmath61 , since this component of a dust cloud is the dominant contributor to resonant ring structure .",
    "we neglect dynamically hot dust with the idea that it can always be added in later as a smooth background @xcite .",
    "the asteroid belt probably produces much of the solar system s dynamically cold dust , while comets are thought to contribute a more dynamically hot cloud component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we treat only steady - state dust clouds , assuming dust is continually replenished , and ignore transient collisional events .",
    "figure [ densities ] shows some examples of the histograms from our simulations , which reveal a wide range of trapping behavior .",
    "some histograms show no azimuthal or radial structure , while others show high contrast rings .",
    "all of the patterns are type i structures as identified by @xcite .",
    "several general trends emerged .",
    "the ring contrast increased with increasing planet mass .",
    "reducing @xmath2 also enhanced trapping , as did increasing the planet s semi - major axis .",
    "these last two trends can be explained by comparing the libration time of a given mmr to the pr time .",
    "the pr time scales as @xmath62 , while the libration time for a given resonance scales as @xmath63 , where @xmath43 is the semi - major axis of a dust grain s orbit .",
    "the ratio of these quantities yields @xmath64 , a parameter that measures the degree to which resonant trapping is adiabatic ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ; the trapping becomes more adiabatic and more efficient at greater distances from the star , and for larger particles .",
    "we discuss this phenomenon further in section [ adiabaticity ] below .",
    "in addition to following these trends , all of the simulated ring structures , like those shown in figure [ densities ] , share some salient features :    1 .   for cases in which even a modest amount of trapping occurs ( azimuthally averaged contrasts @xmath65 ) ,",
    "the ring structures exhibit a sharp inner edge at @xmath66 .",
    "this feature probably appears because the eccentricities of particles trapped in exterior mmrs are typically pumped up to a limiting value before a close encounter with the planet ejects them from resonance . for a particular mmr ,",
    "all particles , regardless of @xmath2 , tend to approach the same limiting eccentricity and accordingly , a similar pericenter distance @xcite .",
    "the limiting eccentricities are such that the limiting pericenter distances are nearly equal for the dominant resonances ( e.g. the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances have limiting pericenter distances of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively ) , creating the ring structure s sharp inner edge .",
    "a gap in the ring structure , a local minimum in the surface density , appears around the planet .",
    "if we define gap width as the fwhm of the minimum in the azimuthal surface density profile at @xmath69 , we find that the gap width is linearly proportional to the contrast of the ring , as shown in the left panel of figure [ gapfigure ] .",
    "a linear fit to the data shown in this figure gives @xmath70 for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the gap width in degrees and @xmath73 is the azimuthally averaged inner - edge contrast ( see section [ ringcontrast ] ) .",
    "3 .   the rings show a leading - trailing asymmetry .",
    "the trailing side of the ring structure is noticeably denser than the leading side , and the structure is rotationally shifted in the prograde direction causing the trailing side to be closer to the planet @xcite . to examine the leading - trailing asymmetry caused by a prograde shift of the ring structure",
    ", we measured the azimuthal offset of the center of the gap described above from the planet .",
    "the right panel of figure [ gapfigure ] shows these measured prograde shifts of our simulations .",
    "@xcite showed for a particular first order exterior mmr , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the prograde shift of the pericenter .",
    "therefore , we plotted the sine of each measured prograde shift against @xmath76 in the right panel of figure [ gapfigure ] .",
    "our data reveal the approximate proportionality @xmath77^{0.5},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the measured prograde shift of the ring structure .",
    "while the relationship in equation [ progradeshift ] holds for a single mmr , it does not strictly apply to a given ring structure which consists of several well - populated mmrs .",
    "the relative populations of these mmrs are also functions of @xmath53 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "however , this situation seems to preserve a power - law relationship between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as shown in equation [ progradeshift2 ] .",
    "the radial width of the ring increases with the contrast of the ring , ranging from a few percent of @xmath1 to @xmath81 in the highest contrast case .",
    "as the trapping probabilities of all the mmrs increase , mmrs farther from the planet s orbit become populated . for this reason ,",
    "the outer - edge of the ring structure differs significantly among simulations .",
    "the outer - edge can be quite blurry or very well - defined , making the radial width of a ring structure difficult to quantify .",
    "our catalog of debris disk structures induced by terrestrial - mass planets is publicly available online at http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/christopher.stark/catalog.php .",
    "this online catalog also contains images synthesized from the density distributions in scattered light and 10 @xmath82 m thermal emission assuming blackbody grains .",
    "future studies of resonant ring structures with tpf or other experiments can use our catalog to interpret dust cloud patterns in terms of planet and dust parameters , assuming the observed image is dominated by a single grain size .",
    "we envision the following process , inspired by recent papers on disks observed with the hubble space telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    1 .   deproject the image to remove inclination effects . 2 .",
    "remove any smooth backgrounds by a power law fit .",
    "3 .   estimate the dominant grain size in the resonant ring using infrared photometry or other methods .",
    "compare the image of the disk to the online catalog to constrain the planet s mass and location .",
    "we considered three different metrics for describing the ring contrast in our simulations :    @xmath83 : the surface density of the ring at its densest point divided by the surface density of the background cloud    @xmath84 : the maximum value of the azimuthally averaged surface density divided by the surface density of the background cloud    @xmath73 : the azimuthally averaged surface density at the inner edge of the ring divided by the surface density of the background cloud    we calculated the above contrast metrics for all 120 simulations .",
    "we measured the surface density of the background cloud at a circumstellar distance @xmath85 .",
    "the surface density of the background cloud was nearly constant inside and outside of the ring , but did exhibit a small local minimum near @xmath85 in a few cases .    to calculate @xmath83 ,",
    "we must search for the densest pixel , which introduces a bias toward pixels that exhibit an extreme amount of poisson noise . to reduce this noise we averaged the surface density over nine pixels centered on the densest point .",
    "using @xmath84 or @xmath73 , on the other hand , automatically averages over the effects of poisson noise in our simulations .",
    "figure [ contrastvsparams ] shows two examples of how the contrast , @xmath73 , depends on planet mass and @xmath2 .",
    "both plots show a similar behavior with three distinct regions : a no - trapping regime ( contrast @xmath861 ) , a transitional regime , and a saturation regime ( maximum contrast ) .",
    "the saturation regime is of particular significance .",
    "our results suggest that within the range of parameters investigated , for a given value of @xmath2 , all contrasts converge to the same value for large planet masses independent of planet semi - major axis , i.e. the contrast becomes  saturated \" and increasing the planet s semi - major axis has little effect on the contrast .",
    "the right panel in figure [ contrastvsparams ] illustrates this behavior ; all four contrast curves , each of which corresponds to a different planet semi - major axis , approach the same value of @xmath87 near @xmath88 .",
    "similarly , for a given planet mass , contrasts converge to the same value for small @xmath2 independent of @xmath1 , as shown in the left panel in figure [ contrastvsparams ] .",
    "the morphology of the structure can vary , but the contrast of the ring structure is roughly constant in these saturation regimes .      as we mentioned above , dividing the pr time by the libration time of a given mmr yields a parameter , @xmath0 , that indicates the degree to which the resonant trapping is adiabatic .",
    "we plot the contrast in our simulations as a function of this parameter in figure [ contrasttrends ] .",
    "this figure demonstrates that for @xmath89 and for a given distribution of parent body orbital elements , the ring contrast is a function of only two parameters : planet mass and @xmath0 .",
    "the morphology of the resonant rings is also , to good approximation , a function of only the planet mass and @xmath0 .",
    "the models shown in the two right panels of figure [ densities ] illustrate this phenomenon ; for both models @xmath90 .",
    "these two models have the same morphology to a level consistent with pixel - to - pixel poisson noise . note that for small @xmath2 in equation [ progradeshift2 ] , the prograde shift is approximately a function of @xmath91 for a given planet mass .    for large values of @xmath2 and @xmath53 , the morphology and contrast of the ring structures are not simple functions of @xmath0 .",
    "simulations with large values of @xmath2 , but equal values of @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) show morphological differences , including differences in prograde shift .",
    "our simulations with @xmath88 also show contrast differences among rings with equal values of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite investigated resonant trapping in mmrs for a system of planetesimals exterior to an outward migrating planet on a circular orbit .",
    "@xcite plotted the trapping probability for a single mmr in his model as a function of migration rate and planet mass and found it could be well approximated by a function of the form @xmath94^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath95 is the migration rate and the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 are power laws in planet mass . our trapping scenario assumes dust migrating inward toward the planet , but the concept is similar .",
    "since contrast is closely related to trapping probability , we decided to fit the data shown in figure [ contrasttrends ] with a function of the form @xmath98 inspired by @xcite .",
    "each of the three parameters , @xmath99 , is a power law in planet mass of the form @xmath100 .",
    "we fit all 120 contrast measurements with this six - parameter function for each of the three contrast metrics .",
    "the best fits , two of which are shown in figure [ contrasttrends ] , are :    @xmath73 : @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103    @xmath84 : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106    @xmath83 : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109    equation [ contrastequation ] , combined with the above values , summarizes our results for all combinations of planet mass , planet semi - major axis and @xmath2 we simulated .",
    "figure [ contrasttrends ] shows the inner - edge contrast , @xmath73 , deviates significantly from the fits for large @xmath53 and large @xmath0 .",
    "the increased trapping efficiency for mmrs with these massive planets likely enhances the population of mmrs farther from the planet s orbit and depletes the inner mmrs that cause the sharp inner edge .",
    "we used our 120 simulations to produce 20 multiple - particle - size dust cloud models by forming weighted sums of the histograms assuming a dohnanyi distribution of particle sizes @xcite .",
    "each of these composite models effectively utilizes 25,000 particles .",
    "exactly how we apply the ideas in @xcite has profound effects on our composite models , so we present here two different kinds of models .",
    "first , we assembled a composite model in which the particles are initially released from their parent bodies according to a crushing law , and do not undergo any further collisional processing as they spiral inward .",
    "this scenario models a sparse disk with a belt of dust - producing material , like our own zodiacal cloud .",
    "the crushing law for asteroid material at micron sizes is unknown , so we choose the crushing law used by @xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the number of particles with radius @xmath14 in a bin of width @xmath112 , and @xmath113 .    we calculate the optical depth , @xmath30 , for our composite models from @xmath114 , where @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are the weighting factor , particle cross - section , and surface number density of the @xmath29 single - particle simulation , respectively .",
    "we assume that the cross - section of each particle is @xmath118 .",
    "the crushing law in equation [ crushinglaw ] implies a weighting factor for the @xmath29 histogram of @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the width of the @xmath121 bin . for a constant logarithmic spacing in @xmath2 , like the spacing we used in our simulations , and the dohnanyi crushing law , @xmath122 .",
    "larger particles have longer pr times , so in the absence of collisional processing , their density is enhanced by a factor of @xmath123 under our assumption of a steady - state cloud model",
    ". one might expect that this effect must be included in the weighting factor .",
    "however , our simulations include this effect automatically as long as we keep the frequency with which particle locations are recorded constant among all of our simulations .",
    "we did , in fact , vary the recording frequency with the pr time , but we corrected for the differences in recording frequency before summing the histograms .",
    "figure [ dohnanyicomparison ] shows the optical depth of one of our 20 composite models ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 au ) , together with the optical depths of single - particle - size models using only the smallest and largest particle sizes included in the composite model .",
    "although the crushing law used by @xcite favors smaller particles by number , even more than some empirical crushing laws @xcite , the optical depth in the composite models is dominated by the largest particles .",
    "this situation occurs because the larger particles are both longer lived ( @xmath126 ) and more likely to be trapped in mmrs .",
    "hence , the upper left panel of the figure closely resembles the lower right panel .",
    "next , for the purpose of illustration , we ignored the initial size distribution of dust particles and forced the disk to obey a size distribution of @xmath127 at a radius of @xmath128 from the star .",
    "this scenario probably does nt have a physical interpretation , but it illustrates an interesting phenomenon : how resonant trapping tends to sort particles by size .",
    "we enforce the size distribution at one location within the disk , but the size distribution will not follow a dohnanyi distribution elsewhere in the disk",
    ".    the top right panel in figure [ dohnanyicomparison ] shows the optical depth of an example of this kind of composite cloud , normalized to a dohnanyi distribution at @xmath129 au .",
    "models constructed in this fashion are more greatly affected by the smallest grains .",
    "hence , the top right panel does not greatly resemble the lower right panel in figure [ dohnanyicomparison ] .",
    "we can further develop these ideas with a simple semi - analytic treatment .",
