    "the relativistic heavy ion collision at rhic or lhc energy liberates lots of constituent partons of nuclei by primary collisions and those partons evolve according to quantum theory and may become a quark - gluon plasma which has been searched intensively by ags and rhic .",
    "the study of the early system of those partons thus are very important and we somehow have to know the momentum distribution as well as the space distribution to understand in details the dynamics of the system as a function of time .",
    "there are several schemes to obtain the initial ( phase space ) distribution of partons : the constituent partons of a nucleus can be characterized by the feynman x where the soft parton has small x and the hard one large x. the soft parton can be identified as the non - abelian weizsacker - williams field radiated from the hard partons and is dominant in number .",
    "while the two nuclei pass through each other in collision , the high x partons of one nucleus can be scattered off from those high x partons of the other nucleus and the non - abelian weicsacker - williams field lose the coherence of the parent parton and become particles .",
    "this initial parton information has been studied by krasnitz et al@xcite and lappi@xcite based on cgc@xcite , namely , shattering of the color glass condensates of two colliding nuclei , and the analytic distribution function has been proposed .",
    "it however can be applicable to the central rapidity region only and the production of quarks or antiquarks can not be calculated from the scheme .",
    "another theory to produce dynamically the partons after a heavy ion collision is that while the colliding nuclei is passing through each other , they rapidly decelerate and produce schwinger - like radiation already in thermal spectrum@xcite . the background field",
    "are the pulse - like cgc of mclerran - venugopalan model of the other nucleus .",
    "this theory could provide the scenario to explain the fast thermalization of the parton system .    even though we can understand the gluon production from these studies , those do not provide the initial baryon density which is shown in rhic experiments@xcite . to understand this phenomena we certainly have to include quarks as well as antiquarks from the primary collision .",
    "consider the cm frame of two colliding nuclei at high energy .",
    "the colliding nuclei are lorentz contracted to become disks and the transversal motion of constituent partons can be ignored since the longitudinal momentum is dominant at high energy .",
    "when the colliding nuclei pass through each other , the constituents of a projectile nucleus make scattering with those of a target nucleus(note that the partons in the same nucleus do not collide with each other since the time delation ) and become particles if the momentum transfer is large enough .",
    "this , so - called , factorization method , has been used to calculate jets or minijets@xcite from early 80s .",
    "there are many schemes to obtain the parton distribution of a hadron or a nucleus@xcite : for examples , we can fold the parton distribution of a nucleon and the nucleon distribution of a nucleus@xcite .",
    "the wave function of a high energy nucleus has been studied extensively and we use grv98 , cteq and an emperical distribution in our study .",
    "since this method only gives relatively high @xmath0 partons but soft partons can not be obtained so that it gives a reasonable distribution at higher energy but does not give good at rhic energy .",
    "the studies on this direction had been persuited by eskola@xcite , by hammon et al.@xcite , by nayak et al.@xcite and by cooper et al.@xcite .",
    "we however think it is worth to extend the study to include baryon and strangeness contents at rhic and lhc energy .",
    "we also briefly note here that the spatial distribution of produced partons can be understood assuming that the quanta becomes particle after the time @xmath1 , which @xmath2 is the transversal energy of the quanta and at the place where the quanta travels @xmath3 from the scattering point .",
    "we rewrite the basic formulas to calculate the production of partons in section ii .",
    "we present the numerical results in section iii .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section iv .",
    "we assume that partons are produced at relativistic heavy - ion collisions by elastic scattering between the constituent of a projectile nucleus and that of a target nucleus .",
    "since the scattering cross section gives the number of collision events per unit overlap area , we can write the total number of events @xcite : @xmath4 where a parton @xmath5 of the nucleus @xmath6 makes a collision with a parton @xmath7 of the nucleus @xmath8 and produces partons @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "the relations between the variables before and after the collision are given by @xmath17 we also rewrite the available kinematic region for convenience @xcite , @xmath18 @xmath19 is the k - factor to include the higher - order diagrams ; we will set @xmath20 throughout our study .",
    "@xmath21 is the momentum scale which we are looking at the nucleus and is a minimum momentum transfer .",
    "the hat on the mandelstan variables means that those are the variables of a parton .",
    "@xmath22 is the nuclear geometric factor at a given impact parameter @xmath23 . assuming that the density of nucleus is constant over the sphere of radius @xmath24 with the sharp edge",
    ", we can write @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the nuclear thickness function .",
    "note that we assume there is no correlation between the position and the momentum of a given parton .    since each event gives two partons , we can write the distribution of produced partons as follows @xmath27 note also that a quark minijet of @xmath28 from a process , for example , @xmath29 , comes from the scattering of a quark of the nucleus a and a gluon of the nucleus b via the t - channel or from the scattering of a gluon of the nucleus a and a quark of the nucleus b via the u - channel so that we have to include both the @xmath30 and the @xmath31 processes multiplied by an approperate distribution , respectively",
