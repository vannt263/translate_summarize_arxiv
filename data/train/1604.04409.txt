    ", we have reported on a different way to produce long microwave pulses by irradiating a second - order nonlinear ktiopo@xmath2 ( ktp ) crystal with @xmath3ns - long pulse trains delivered by a high - intensity , mode - locked laser in the near infrared at @xmath0 nm .",
    "the @xmath4ps - long pulses are repeated at a rate @xmath5ghz . as a result ,",

    "the low - frequency branch of the fourier spectrum of @xmath6 contains the fundamental rf  harmonic at frequency @xmath11 and several of its overtones .",
    "the fundamental harmonic can be easily detected by placing the crystal in a microwave cavity that acts as a narrow bandpass filter .",

    "the measurements have been carried out by placing the crystals either in a microwave cavity or in a waveguide of much wider passband in order to measure the microwave overtones . as rf generation is a second - order nonlinear phenomenon intimately related to optical shg ,",

    "the laser beam has an ellipsoidal gaussian profile with effective area @xmath21mm@xmath22 and its intensity averaged over the spot size is @xmath23 it can be reduced by inserting calibrated neutral density filters in the beam path and is measured with a bolometer ( b ) ( coherent , mod .",

    "a picture of the cavity assembly is shown in  , part ( b ) .",
    "the crystals under investigation , of typical size @xmath24mm@xmath25 are cut in the shape of a right square prism with the long edge directed along the @xmath26 direction and the square face lying in the @xmath27 plane . in order to investigate the fundamental rf harmonic , the crystal",
    "is placed in a rectangular rf cavity designed so as to sustain a te@xmath28 mode tuned to the laser repetition rate .",
    "a contour plot of the electric field distribution around the crystal in the cavity is shown in  , part ( c ) .",
    "if higher rf harmonics are to be detected , the crystal is placed in a coaxial waveguide consisting of two concentric cylindrical conductors of inner and outer diameter @xmath29 mm and @xmath30 mm , respectively , that is designed to support tem modes up to @xmath31ghz and te and tm modes of higher frequency  @xcite .",
    "when the cavity is used , the crystal is mounted on a rotary goniometer ( g ) and can be rotated through an angle @xmath32 in order to maximize the rf signal detected by a critically coupled antenna .",
    "the electrical power transferred to the cavity field is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the polarization current density@xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that rf signal shows two maxima and two minima for a complete turn of the shaft about its @xmath26 axis as is shown in ,    in which we plot how the rf signal amplitude @xmath35 of the ktp crystal and the resonance frequency @xmath11 of the cavity vary with the crystal alignment with respect to the cavity mode polarization .",

    "we note that a crystal rotation about one of its geometrical symmetry axis can only maximally align the polarization along the cavity mode polarization because the geometrical axes may not coincide with the crystallographic ones .",

    "the amplitude of the rf emission is obtained by fitting a lorentzian function to the numeric fourier transform of the recorded rf signal .",
    "the conversion factor between the lorentzian amplitude and the actual rms rf amplitude is simply @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of points sampled by the oscilloscope .",
    "the observed phenomenon is explained by introducing the crystal second - order nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor of elements @xmath39 the laser electric field after the half - wave plate at the crystal entrance face can be written as @xmath40 in which @xmath41 is its amplitude and @xmath42 is its polarization vector given by @xmath43 the function @xmath44 represents the pulse train and can be written as @xmath45 \\label{eq : train}\\ ] ] in which the pulses are assumed rectangular .",

    "it can be shown  @xcite that , in the condition of our experiment , the amplitude of the rf field radiated by the crystal is proportional to the second time derivative of the slowly varying dielectric polarization    @xmath67    thus , the rf signal detected in our apparatus is proportional to it .",
    "all harmonics should be proportional to the laser intensity and share the same angular behaviour .",
    "similarly , the spectrum of the sh radiation emitted by the crystal , which is the time - averaged square modulus of the second time derivative of @xmath68 consists in a restricted - band frequency comb centered around the frequency @xmath69hz and width of order @xmath70ghz@xmath71 so that all frequencies are in the optical region",
    ". as a result , the integrated intensity @xmath72 can be cast in the form @xmath73 in which @xmath74 the 8- and 4-fold periodicity stems from the quartic terms in @xmath75 .",
    "we note that the elements of the nonlinear second - order susceptibility tensor for or , @xmath76 and for shg , @xmath77 could in principle be different but we have shown that in this experiment they actually are equal so that no superscript is needed to tag them  @xcite .",
    "finally , as a consequence of the symmetry with respect to the interchange of indices @xmath78 and @xmath79 in  , we will use the contracted indices form of the optical tensor that is represented by a @xmath80 matrix of elements @xmath81 that operates on the @xmath82 column vector to yield the amplitude of the second - order nonlinear polarization  @xcite .",

    "for znse we used a weaker @xmath112 because of its smaller damage threshold .",

    ", we have been able to detect several higher order rf harmonics , up to four for ktp and lbo and up to three for znse , as shown on  .",
    "linbo@xmath1 was not investigated in this experiment .",
    "the amplitude of all harmonics depends linearly on @xmath118 thereby validating  .",
    "we note that the harmonics are not naturally ordered according to their expected strength . in ktp and",
    "znse the second harmonic is stronger than the first one .",
    "moreover , ktp appears to produce more rf than znse in contrast with the cavity result . in any case",
    ", lbo is confirmed to be the least efficient .",
    "we noted that the placement of the crystal in the waveguide is a critical issue .",
    "tiny displacements of the same crystal could lead to significant relative and absolute changes of the harmonic strengths .",
    "the reason for this behaviour might be ascribed to the strong non uniformity of the electric field distribution in the waveguide  @xcite that makes the positioning of the crystal hardly reproducible .     as a final remark",
    ", we note that , in the present experiment , the rf generation is not affected by the shg because the efficiency of shg is well below @xmath119  @xcite owing to the fact that the crystals are not cut so as to obtain phase matching at the wavelength of the experiment .",
    "thus , the pump beam is not expected to significantly be depleted by sh conversion .",
    "as previously mentioned , we have also carried out shg measurements when using the microwave cavity .",
    "the sh intensity is measured with a photodiode whose output is averaged over the duration of the laser pulse train , thus yielding @xmath120 .",
    "all investigated crystals do actually emit light at @xmath121 nm with different efficiency , as shown in  .",
    "as expected , according to , the sh intensity is a quadratic function of the laser intensity @xmath122 ktp is the less efficient of all of them whereas linbo@xmath1 is the most efficient one .",
    "as observed in our previous experiment@xcite , and explained in , the microwave emission depends on the crystal axes orientation with respect to the laser polarization .",
    "this fact can be exploited to build an experimental setup for the measurement of the elements of the second - order optical tensor . to this goal",
    ", the measurements can be either carried out in a cavity or in a waveguide .",
    "in we compare the amplitude of the microwave produced by ktp irradiated in the cavity with a laser intensity @xmath123mw / cm@xmath22 ( open squares ) and that of the 1st harmonic in the waveguide for @xmath125mw / cm@xmath22 .",
    "the two sets of measurements are in good agreement .",
    "the dependence of the rf  signal on @xmath19 is due to the function @xmath126 and , according to  , all rf  harmonics should share the same behaviour . in",
    "we plot the angular dependence of the first four rf harmonics of ktp measured in the waveguide at constant laser intensity @xmath127mw/@xmath128 and constant repetition rate @xmath129ghz .",
    "as expected , the angular behaviour is the same for all of them .",
    "moreover , it is easily verified that the four curves in coincide if each is multiplied by a suitable constant scaling factor .",
    "the same is true also for all other crystals .",
    "once more , this observation remarks the fact that all fourier components of the rf spectrum share the same prefactor @xmath130    in through , we show the angular dependence of the fundamental rf  harmonic amplitude measured in the cavity .    for all crystals , @xmath35 shows 4-fold periodicity as a function of @xmath19 and , except znse",
    ", the maximum rfproduction occurs at the same angle of maximum shg . for znse ,",
    "the rf maximum roughly occurs at the angle at which sh is minimum and vice versa .",
    "this behaviour is related to the nonlinear tensor structure .",
    "that is why we carried out rf measurements in znse for two crystal orientations @xmath32 that differ by @xmath131  ( ) .    at constant @xmath112 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the contribution of the second - order nonlinear polarization to the amplitude of the rf signal measured in the cavity is given by the weighted sum of the contributions of each of its cartesian components @xmath132 in which  @xmath133 is a constant and @xmath134 are the director cosines .",
    "as the relative orientation of the nonlinear polarization field relative to the cavity mode polarization is unknown , the director cosines are to be treated as adjustable parameters . however , there is less freedom than it appears because there is the strong constraint imposed by the crystal structure via the form of the susceptibility tensor @xmath63 that determines the analytic form of @xmath135 given by  , in which the components of the laser field given by are expressed in the frame of reference of the crystallographic axes .",
