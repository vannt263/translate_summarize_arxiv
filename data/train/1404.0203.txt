    "many complex systems can be described , within a certain level of modelization , as stochastic processes .",
    "a general stochastic process can be characterized in the linear noise approximation through a fokker - planck equation , in continuous variables . for dealing with discrete variables in discrete time steps ,",
    "often markov chains are the models of choice .",
    "although in many cases both approaches converge in the limit of small time steps and increments of the stochastic variables , this correspondence is in general non - trivial@xcite . in the fokker - planck picture ,",
    "the so - called kramers - moyal ( km ) coefficients provide a complete description of a given stochastic process@xcite .    in the past decades",
    ", numerical procedures have been established to estimate the km coefficients from measured stochastic data , which are applicable for any stationary , i.e.  time - homogeneous , markov process .",
    "these methods require large sequences of data , but they are robust@xcite , have well - known errors and limitations@xcite , require little intervention and are typically parameter - free@xcite",
    ".    however , for non - stationary markov processes , much fewer methods and results are available to our knowledge . in this case",
    ", estimations of the time - dependent km coefficients can be obtained by two approaches : either the data from the inhomogeneous process is split into shorter , homogeneous sequences , on which then an estimate of the km coefficients can be performed through the aforementioned methods@xcite . or , if the inhomogeneous process is also cyclic , a parametrized time - dependent _ ansatz _ for the km coefficients can be fit to the data@xcite .",
    "compared to the stationary processes , both approaches for the inhomogeneous case require a much higher level of pre - analysis , guesswork and iterative improvement .    in this paper , we present a method that allows to estimate the transition matrices of a time - inhomogeneous markov model from data .",
    "as reported in a previous publication@xcite , this method provides results with a considerable level of accuracy . under well - known limitations",
    ", the discrete markov model corresponds to a continuous stochastic process in the form of a fokker - planck equation , which is completely characterized , in this case , through its time - dependent km coefficients . from the transition matrices",
    ", we can immediately calculate these km coefficients , and therefore characterize the dynamical features underlying the time - dependent stochastic process .",
    "we apply this methodology to data from a turbine in a wind park , where measurements of the wind velocity and direction , and the electric power output of the turbine are taken in @xmath0 minute intervals .",
    "the results presented from this analysis show the general applicability of our method and are in agreement with previous findings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] by introducing both the cyclic time - dependent markov model and the procedure for extracting stochastic evolution equations directly from data series . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the data and in sec .",
    "[ sec : d1d2 ] we present the time - dependent functions that define the stochastic evolution of the state of the wind turbine .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "this section describes the methodology used for the data analysis . in sec .",
    "[ section : markovprocess ] the cyclic inhomogeneous markov model to represent the daily patterns in the data is described and in sec .",
    "[ section : langevin ] we explain how stochastic evolution equations are derived directly from the markov process transition matrices .",
    "the goal of this time - inhomogeneous markov process is to get a model that accurately reproduces the long - term behavior while considering the daily patterns observed in the data .",
    "thus , the proposed objective function combines two maximum likelihood estimators : the first term maximizes the likelihood of the cycle - average probability ; and , the second term maximizes the likelihood of the time - dependent probability .",
    "the final optimization problem is transformed into a convex one using the negative logarithm of the objective function .",
    "this section gives a brief overview over the final optimization problem .",
    "a detailed description of the objective function , the parametrization of the time - variant probability functions , and the constraints that must be added to the optimization problem to ensure its markov properties is provided in @xcite .",
    "a discrete finite markov process @xmath1 is a stochastic process on a discrete finite state space @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 , whose future evolution depends only on its current state @xcite .",
    "it can be fully described by the conditional probability @xmath4 of the markov process moving to state @xmath5 at time step @xmath6 given that it is in state @xmath7 at time @xmath8 .",
    "it is called the @xmath8-th step transition probability , denoted as @xmath9 .",
    "being time - dependent , the markov process has associated transition probability matrices @xmath10 that change with time . considering @xmath11 possible states , the matrices @xmath10 have dimension @xmath12 with entries @xmath13_{i , j } = p_{i , j}(t)$ ] for all @xmath14 , satisfying @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    markov process is called cyclic with period @xmath17 , if @xmath18 is the smallest number , such that @xmath19 for all @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite . since this paper deals with discrete data , @xmath18 and @xmath22 can considered to be multiples of the time step @xmath23 between successive data points and therefore integers .",
    "one can describe the cyclic markov process by @xmath18 transition matrices @xmath24 ,  @xmath25 .",
    "the remainder of time step @xmath8 modulo @xmath18 will be denoted as @xmath26 and consequently @xmath27 .",
    "we fix @xmath28 day and use @xmath29 .    in this paper ,",
    "the transition probabilities @xmath30 are modeled by bernstein polynomials , namely @xmath31 where @xmath32 indicates the time of the day ( @xmath28 day ) , @xmath33 is the @xmath34-th bernstein basis polynomial of order @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the choice of these polynomials has several advantages properly described in @xcite .    to maximize the likelihood of the time - dependent transition probabilities given the data ,",
    "the objective function must consider the time of the day @xmath37 when the transition happens .",
    "the corresponding term of the objective function is thus given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the set of observed transitions together with the time @xmath37 when they happens .",
    "this estimator allows to compute the intra - cycle transition probability functions , and thus to represent the daily patterns present in the data .",
    "a second term is added to this function , namely @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the set of transitions observed in the data and @xmath42 is the cycle - average ( daily ) probability of transition from state @xmath7 to @xmath5 .",
    "it is given by @xmath43 .",
    "this second term is the maximum likelihood estimator for the daily average probability and its addition to the objective function increases the consistency of the long - term behavior of the markov process with the data .",
    "using the resulting overall objective function the optimization problem to be solved for the transition probability coefficients @xmath44 is translated into the minimization of @xmath45 subject to    @xmath46    with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath35 being the order of the bernstein polynomials and @xmath49 the number of subdivisions . constraint ( [ rowstochasticity ] ) assures the row - stochasticity of the transition matrices , while constraints ( [ c0 ] ) and ( [ c1 ] ) impose @xmath50- and @xmath51-continuity at @xmath52 .",

    "the data for this study was obtained from a wind power turbine in a wind park located in a mountainous region in portugal .",
    "the time series consists of a three - year period ( 2009 - 2011 ) of historical data gotten from the turbine data logger .",
    "the sampling time of 10 minutes leads to 144 samples each day .",
    "the data - set comprises three variables , wind power , speed and direction ( nacelle orientation ) .",
    "the wind speed information was collected from the anemometer placed in the wind turbine hub .",
    "due to confidentiality , wind power and speed data values are reported as a fraction of the rated power and the cut - out speed , respectively .    for this markov model , each state",
    "is defined by the values of all three variables , namely the wind speed , wind direction and power output .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the data observations and the state partitions projected into the wind direction and speed plane ( right ) and the wind power and speed plane ( left ) .",
    "as expected , the observations projected into the wind power and speed plane define the characteristic power curve of the wind turbine .",
    "the data space is discretized unevenly to get a good resolution of the high - slope region of the power curve . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", this partition was used in a time - homogeneous markov chain and proved to lead to an accurate representation of the original data .",
    "the wind direction and power are divided by an equally spaced grid leading to 12 and 20 classes , respectively .",
    "the wind speed is divided as follows : values below the cut - in speed define one class ; between the cut - in and rated wind speed the discretization is narrowed by selecting 10 classes ; and between the rated and cut - out wind speed discretization is widened and 4 classes are defined .",
    "data points with wind speed above the cut - out wind speed are discarded .",
    "the complete state set is constructed by listing all possible combinations of the classes of each variable . due to physical constraints between the variables ,",
    "most of the states are empty and can are therefore discarded .",
    "this reduces the number of states from 3840 to 778 , for this turbine .    to compare the model with the original data , wind power , speed and direction time series were simulated adapting the method described by sahin and sen @xcite to the cyclic time - inhomogeneous markov model as follows",
    "first , we compute the cumulative probability transition matrices @xmath75 with entries @xmath76_{i , j } = \\sum_{j^{\\prime } = 0}^{j}p_{i , j^{\\prime}}(r)$ ] . then an initial state @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78 , is randomly selected . a new datapoint @xmath79",
    "is generated by uniformly selecting a random number @xmath80 between zero and one and choosing for @xmath79 the corresponding state @xmath81 such that the probability of reaching it from the current state @xmath7 fullfils @xmath82_{i , i^{\\prime } } \\geq \\epsilon$ ] .",
    "based on this discrete state sequence , a real value for the wind power / speed / direction variables is generated by sampling each state partition uniformly .",
    "figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] compare the original data with the synthesized data and demonstrate , that the model can capture the data s long - term statistics ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) as well as the daily patterns ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "with the procedure outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] and having the @xmath83 transition matrices generated as described in sec .  [ sec : data ] and [ section : markovprocess ] , we can now reconstruct the time - dependent stochastic process by calculating the km coefficients @xmath84 at each time step @xmath85 .",
    "although we obtain the km coefficients as a function of all three stochastic variables , @xmath86 $ ] , we here consider only their dependency on the velocity and power production , @xmath87 $ ] , averaging over the contributions from @xmath88 .",
    "the results of this process are presented in fig.[fig4 ] , where the reconstructed km coefficients are plotted for three time steps , namely at @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 hours .",
    "the support of the coefficients is limited to the available data which follows the power curves in the @xmath92-@xmath93 plane . from the inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] , changes in time seem not significative .",
    "this means , that even though both the markov and the stochastic evolution model contain additional degrees of freedom due to their time - dependent formulation , they are capable of capturing the @xmath92-@xmath93-dependency , which is invariant .",
    "this is expected since the wind turbine operation characteristics should not change through the daily cycle .",
    "however , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the procedure is capable of detecting even subtle temporal changes in the transition matrix , which lead to strong daily changes in the km coefficients .    for all plotted times , the drift coefficients @xmath94",
    "indicate a restoring force towards the power curve , in accordance with previous results@xcite .",
    "the diffusion coefficients  only the diagonal components are shown here ",
    "show a order of magnitude weaker diffusion in the velocity than in the power , where the latter shows a strong component for diffusion in the @xmath95 direction for high values of @xmath96 .",
    "these results again are consistent with our previous analysis of a time - homogeneous model @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the out - of the @xmath97 plane diffusion of the direction component @xmath98 is strongest for both very high and very low velocities , and for intermediate velocities off the power curve .",
    "next , we present a closer inspection of the time - dependence of both drift and diffusion , by considering their temporal evolution at a specific point , namely at @xmath99 , which is close to the center of the power curve . apparently , our method creates smooth curves for the temporal evolution .",
    "this is expected since , as a consequence of the parametrization of the markov model , it can be shown that the conditional moments used to derive the drift and diffusion coefficients also can be expressed by bernstein polynomials in time .",
    "most strikingly , it can be seen that the temporal evolution of both the drift and diffusion coefficient is decoupled between the components .",
    "furthermore , for the same component the evolution of the diffusion coefficient seems to be delayed with respect to the drift .",
    "the dominant component is always the power production @xmath93 , whose drift changes from a positive maximum at @xmath89 h to a negative minimum at @xmath100 h , i.e.  the restoring force oscillates from a tendency to higher @xmath93 values in the morning to a tendency to lower @xmath93 values in the evening .",
    "it should be noted that the chosen point @xmath101 is not necessarily characteristic of the wind field or of the turbine s power production .",
    "other points along the power curve , specifically for low velocities and near the rated wind speed are either more frequent or more characteristic , and their analysis should give increased insight into the temporal evolution of wind speed and power production .",
    "+   +   +   +   +     +",
    "we have shown in this paper how a time - dependent multi - dimensional stochastic process can be reconstructed from experimental data .",
    "our method provides results in terms of the time - dependent transition matrix of a markov model , from which the time - dependent kramers - moyal coefficients for a corresponding continuous process can be calculated .",
    "application of this method to data from a turbine in a wind park gives results consistent with a previous time - independent method , and adds surprising new insight into the temporal dynamics of the wind field and the machine power production .",
    "preliminary results have shown that the dependence with time observed in fig .",
    "5 changes depending which region of the power curve we choose .",
    "a more systematic study for the full power - velocity range will be carried out in an extended study .",
    "future research will also address the question of applicability of our method to more general cases , dealing also with the reliability and relative errors of this approach .",
    "the aforementioned equivalence of the transition matrix and the km coefficients is valid if two requirements are fulfilled .",
    "first , the transition amplitudes need to have gaussian shape , which corresponds to the existence of gaussian noise in the stochastic process .",
    "the validity of this assumption has been checked previously for a similar system and can be reasonably assumed in this case .",
