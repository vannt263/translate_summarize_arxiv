    "the selection of the part of the population that have access to high education is challenge particularly because this has important implication in the future of nation .",
    "china was the first country in the world to face this challenge .",
    "the imperial examination created in 605 during the sui dynasty was a civil service examination system in imperial china to select candidates for the state bureaucracy .",
    "this system persisted until its extinction in 1905  @xcite .    recognizing that having a standardized test to select the elite would guarantee the future of the united kingdom",
    ", the idea of the test was introduced into europe in the early 19th century by the britain s consul in guangzhou , china , thomas taylor meadows  @xcite . in 1806",
    "the united kingdom introduced the selection of public servants through an examination .    in the high education system the standardized test was first employed by napoleon that created le baccalaurat or simply le bac . in the united kingdom",
    "it was created the the general certificate of secondary education .",
    "it was from britain that standardized testing spread , not only throughout the british commonwealth , but to europe and then america .",
    "in the united states two systems dominate the selection of the universities : the scholastic aptitude test ( sat ) and the american college testing ( act ) created in 1926 and in 1959 respectively .",
    "the first focus on evaluation abilities while the second measures deduction skills .    the current standardize tests in the united states , european countries and asia have in common that they are organized in such a way that the scores follow a normal distribution  @xcite , @xmath0 , that is characterized by the mean @xmath1 and standard deviation @xmath2 .",
    "the result of a particular candidate in one test , @xmath3 , becomes universally comparable by the regular transformation @xmath4 .    even thought quite appealing due to its simplicity , the use of standardized tests to select the entrance at the universities is not free from criticisms  @xcite .",
    "because the exams are tested in a biased population , minorities and foreigners show difficulties in understanding the cultural subtleties  @xcite .",
    "in addition it is not clear that the of one year or one test can be compared with the results from other years or other tests simply by performing a good performance in the college is correlated with the scores obtained at the standardized tests but with the performance at the high school  @xcite .    in the particular case of the united states , since the admission is a multidimensional process in which not only the sat or act scores , but also the performance at the high school , recommendation letters and extra curricular activities are taken into account ; the criticisms to the standardized test method imply a lower impact in the selection process when compared with countries in which the score is the only evaluated dimension .",
    "in addition , other countries have a number of competing standardized tests what also guarantee that the education does not become hostage of one evaluation method .",
    "a proper analysis of the standardized tests that would answer to the criticisms  @xcite to the method is not possible , since the scores of all these standardized exams are not available for detailed analysis .    in brazil the procedure to enter at the high education system up to the end of the 20th century",
    "were exams organized by each college . even though this method guarantee diversity in the selection process , it made mobility of the student rather difficult .",
    "in addition , differently from the united states and some european union countries , brazil does not use an university admission system based on historical or annual tests of high school students but only this entrance exam . typically , the university entrance examination is composed of several multiple choice exams which encompass all high school subject areas .    over the last decade ,",
    "the brazilian government has introduced a standardized university entrance examination known as enem ( _ pt _ : exame nacional do ensino mdio - _ en _ : high school national examination ) .",
    "this new exam is applied across the country what allows for mobility of the students from one state to the other , uses a methodology that allow for comparison of the scores obtained in one year with the scores of the previous years and is elaborated in a centralized form .",
    "the major drawback of using one unique exam to select the students is that the system becomes dependent of type of analysis .",
    "additional problems are the following .",
    "the exam is too ample .",
    "it covers a very large number of questions , and many students are not able to finish the ( long ) exam questions in the allowed exam time .",
    "this means that questions are not homogeneously solved by the students since they possibly solve the questions in different samples .",
    "thus , candidates with partial knowledge of the high school subjects potentially can have the same opportunity ( and perform similarly to ) a candidate with a comprehensive background .",
    "extensive , unclear and redundant question statements take too much time to read and grasp and do not explore relevant knowledge of the students ; rather , understanding a question statement has affected the students performance .",
    "moreover , it is also important to mention the unclear methods used to calculate the examination scores and the absence ( or lack of ) brute scores for external analyses by the independent scientific community .",
    "finally , no changes have been made in the exam methodology since its inception , which could lead to improvements in the test questions .    despite the many criticisms about the contents of the enem s questions  la14,la15",
    ", the process has its merits .",
    "if it is managed and carried out properly it would lead to an interesting mechanism to tackle biases and distortions towards bringing a larger contingent of state owned high school students to public universities .",
    "however , before it becomes a unique tool to evaluate all the students in brazil , the enem has to be evaluated and tested against another existing local exams .",
    "as far as we know this was never done with the other standardized tests , maybe with the exception of the sat which performance has been checked against high school grades but for a very narrow number of students  @xcite .    in this paper statistical physics tools",
    "are employed to understand the universal aspects of this exam .",
    "this strategy is not new and has been used to analyze high school performance  @xcite .",
    "the scores that the students obtained in the different disciplines in the enem are analyzed .",
    "in addition the scores obtained by the different high schools in the same exam are also evaluated .",
    "finally a comparison between the performance of a selected number of students at the enem and at a local exam at one specific university , the universidade federal do rio grande do sul ( ufrgs ) , during three consecutive years is also shown providing a unique tool to identify what differ in the profile of the students selected by both methods .",
    "the remaining of the paper goes as follows . in the sec .",
    "[ section : data ] the data set employed in this work is introduced , in the sec .",
    "section : results the results are presented and conclusions summarize the paper in sec .",
    "[ section : conclusions ] .",
    "the first part of our data set supplies the average scores of the @xmath5 high schools from brazil in 2013 considering : school percentage ( participation ) rate of their students and the economic ( average family income ) level of the school .",
    "the exam is composed by tests in five different school subject : writing , language , human sciences , natural sciences , and mathematics .",
    "the economic ( income ) level of the schools are divided into 7 different levels : very high , high , high average , average , low average , low , and very low .",
    "we attributed @xmath6 respectively for these levels .",
    "the second data set supplies enem and ufrgs entrance examination scores of the students that have taken both exams .",
    "we have analyzed students by three consecutive years 2011 , 2012 and 2013 .",
    "here we have cleaned the data by extracting students that have score zero in one or more school subjects .",
    "for example for 2011 we after cleaning we have @xmath7  students that performed the exam the school subject writing at ufrgs . from these students",
    "only @xmath8  had also non zero score at this same school subject at ufrgs , which is the minimum ( worst case ) size sample used in our work for all comparison tests ( pearson correlation and ranking tests ) used in this work .",
    "this means that in all possible cross over between two school subjects considering all combinations : ufrgs with ufrgs or enem with enem or even ufrgs with enem we had always larger samples .",
    "this guarantees the good significance in our calculations .",
    "for example we find in 2013 more than @xmath9  students that performed the school subject math in both ufrgs and enem with non zero score .",
    "the high school subjects of the ufrgs entrance examination that we considered compatible for a suitable comparison with enem are : writing , geography , history , physics , chemistry , biology , and mathematics .",
    "writing and mathematics have a direct association between the ufrgs and enem examinations . for our purposes , we associate humanities ( enem ) with geography and history ( ufrgs ) , and natural sciences ( enem ) with physics , chemistry , and biology ( ufrgs ) .",
    "first , the correlations between the scores at different subjects obtained by all the high schools were computed . the fig .",
    "[ correlation_scattering ] illustrates the comparison between these scores .",
    "visually , these diagrams show a strong linear correlation between the scores of different subjects .",
    "this indication can be quantified by a single number , the pearson correlation coefficient given by@xmath10where @xmath3 and @xmath11 represent the scores of two different subjects associated to @xmath12-th institution , with @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath14 vary from @xmath15 when the two data sets are negatively correlated , to @xmath16 when they are uncorrelated up to @xmath17 when they are positively correlated .",
    "since @xmath14 is computed averaged over all the @xmath18 schools it gives a robust indication of the correlations between the performance of the schools in the different topics .",
    "table  [ table : correlations ] illustrates the values of @xmath14  for the different pair of topics .",
    "we can observe a high correlation among the different schools which is not a surprise indeed , since the score schools are more representative because represent averages over many students . however some particularities must be mentioned",
    ". all subjects are more correlated with language and humanities ( or human sciences ) than with writing .",
    "this is quite surprising since in principle one would expect that natural sciences and mathematics would show a less evident correlation with language or humanities .",
    "language and human sciences are slightly more correlated with writing than natural sciences and maths .",
    "although the biggest correlations are found in the somewhat more intuitive cases : between language and human sciences and between natural sciences and maths , @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ; we also found @xmath21 between human and natural sciences and @xmath22 between human sciences and maths , which are not expected results if the analysis was made with correlation for the different schools .",
    "the last row of the table ( in bold ) corresponds to correlation coefficients between each school subject and the average final score of the schools what is quite strong .",
    "this indicates that either the schools in brazil shown not specific strength in any subject or the exam is unable to capture the difference in the performance of the schools in different areas of knowledge .",
    ".pearson correlation coefficients , @xmath14 , between the two subjects scores in the enem 2013 .",
    "the last row corresponds to the coefficient between each school subject score and the average score of the institution . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table : procedure_calcula_beta    the @xmath23values are shown in last columns in table table : ranking_deviations .",
    "there are a notorious correspondence between @xmath24 and @xmath25 which corroborates the definition used to measure the difference between two rankings .",
    "we are convinced that all factors previously raised with respect to enem , such as the size of question statements , the duration of the exam provides conditions to less prepared students to obtain similar scores of well prepared students that have more comprehensive knowledge .",
    "this is observed by the statistics related to score distribution : such statistics show an apparent homogenization of the evaluation system process when actually it should separate the well - prepared and the other candidates .",
    "standardized university entrance exams have been employed in many countries .",
    "they share the characteristics of formatting the distribution of scores to be fitted by a gaussian . in this paper",
    "we study one particular standardized test , the brazilian s enem examination .",
    "we found that unlike the students scores distribution , the schools scores do not follow the gaussian , but forms a two peaked distribution best fitted by an ec distribution .",
    "this reflects the fact that the average schools score increases linearly with the economic level of the school in two distinct regions with different slopes .",
    "this indicates that the exam is designed to identify skills that are more commonly found in the economic elite of the country .",
    "one possible explanation is the that since the exam is very long , it requires that the students would be trained to spend hours focusing on one specific topic , which is a kind of training that the more expensive schools are able to provide .",
    "since the schools scores distribution is not a gaussian , it can not be used to compare the schools performance over time since it is not a standardized measure .    next ,",
    "the score of the students in the enem and in the ufrgs exams were compared .",
    "the correlation between different subject in both cases can be observed .",
    "surprisingly , the correlation between human sciences and natural sciences and math is quite high in the case of the enem , which suggests that the exam is not measuring the specific abilities in the different themes .    since the enem s scores and the ufrgs s scores follow very different distributions the change from one standardized test to a more itemize exam implies selecting a different type of student . in summary , we employed statistical methods to understand the characteristics of the selection in two exams : one standardized test and a non standardized exam .",
    "our results indicate that there are differences in the selection of students is obtained when each one of these exams is performed",
    ". it would be interesting in the future to compared through the efficiency of higher education , enade , the performance as professionals of the students selected by each one of these methods  @xcite .",
    "we thank the brazilian agencies cnpq , inct - fcx , and capes for the financial support .",
