    "the origin and nature of the pseudogap phase in the high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors still remains an unresolved problem  @xcite .",
    "the pseudogap phase , which occurs in the underdoped regime of hole doping , and at temperature range @xmath3 , displays many interesting properties including various charge , spin , electron nematic , or current ordered states competing with superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "recently a nonzero polar kerr effect ( pke ) has been observed in the pseudogap phase in a number of recent experiments  @xcite , but with unusual characteristics .",
    "the effect measures the angle of rotation of linearly polarized light reflected from a medium at normal incidence and typically signals time reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking in the reflecting medium  @xcite . in a ferromagnetic material , the signs of the polar kerr angle from two opposite surfaces of the same sample",
    "are expected to be different .",
    "this is because the net magnetic moment points in the same direction throughout the sample and hence if it points away from the sample on the top surface , it points into the sample on the bottom surface , see fig .",
    "[ fm_afm ] .",
    "moreover , it should be possible to choose ( or ` train ' ) the direction of the net magnetic moment , and , in turn , the sign of the polar kerr angle , by cooling the sample in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , in high-@xmath4 superconductors it has been observed that the signs of pke from the two opposite surfaces of the same sample are identical , and , moreover , the signal can not be trained by magnetic field . to account for these puzzling experimental observations ,",
    "time - reversal invariant models with gyrotropic order were employed recently @xcite . however , the concept of gyrotropic order as an explanation for non - zero pke in the cuprates were subsequently retracted @xcite because it does not satisfy onsager s reciprocity principle in normal reflection that forbids a non - zero pke in the absence of trs breaking @xcite .        here",
    "we show that the observations in high-@xmath5 can be understood in the framework of a chiral @xmath1-density wave state @xcite in the presence of interlayer tunneling , which is invariant under trs in the bulk , but can still have a non zero pke because it is a property of the light reflected from the top surface which breaks trs locally .",
    "therefore pke in this mechanism would be insensitive to the changing skin depth of the incoming light at the top surface , while pke from a bulk order parameter based description would yield a stronger effect for a longer skin depth .",
    "the chiral @xmath1-density wave state is defined by adding a small @xmath6 component to the dominant @xmath7 , i.e. with the combined order parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the net order parameter breaks trs at each cuo plane and results in a non - zero hall conductivity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the addition of a possible @xmath6 component could be a result of microscopic electronic interactions @xcite , or a structural transition that breaks the symmetry between the neighboring plaquettes . in the @xmath7 state , by itself , spontaneous currents alternatingly circulate around plaquettes of the two - dimensional square lattice , thus preserving the macroscopic trs , but not any associated chirality .",
    "we establish that , for our present model , the angle of rotation due to one layer is cancelled by its neighbor , resulting in zero faraday rotation of the polarization plane of the transmitted light .",
    "however , since pke is primarily a surface phenomenon , where the light reflected from the top ( or bottom ) surface at normal incidence changes its plane of polarization , there can be a non - zero pke .",
    "furthermore , since bilayer cuprates usually cleave through the reservoir layers separating the cuo bilayers , the magnetizations at the top and bottom surfaces should point opposite to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fm_afm ] ) , giving rise to the same sign of the kerr angle .",
    "finally , since the system as a whole is an oaf , coupling to a small external magnetic field should be small , resulting , most likely , in a small or non - existent magnetic field ` training ' effect .",
    "importantly , to the best of our knowledge , the scenario presented here is the only one consistent with all the puzzling phenomenology seen in the recent pke experiments in cuprates .",
    "it has been argued that much of the phenomenology of the cuprates in the underdoped regime can be unified @xcite by making a single assumption that the ordered @xmath10-density wave ( ddw ) state is responsible for the pseudogap .",
    "moreover , an extensive hartree - fock calculation for @xmath10 state has recently been carried out  @xcite . so far , evidence of magnetism arising from @xmath1-density wave in neutron or nmr measurements has been controversial . however , the success of the present phenomenological model in explaining pke must speak in favor of the suggested order parameter .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : in section ii , we introduce the chiral @xmath1-density wave state order parameter , and calculate the anomalous hall conductivity of a single layer . in section iii , we discuss the problem of light propagation through a single cuprate layer , and then calculate the kerr and faraday responses through the bilayer system in section iv .",

    "the hall conductivity @xmath9 reverses it sign at the bottom layer at @xmath95 .",

    "( [ r_t ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) . since the chiral ddw with interlayer tunneling is an oaf , the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization of light due to one layer is cancelled by its neighbor , resulting in zero faraday rotation of the transmitted light .",

    "further , since the magnetizations at the top and bottom surfaces should point opposite to each other ( see fig .",
    "[ fm_afm ] ) , the two surfaces give rise to the same sign of the kerr angle . finally , since the system as a whole is an oaf , coupling to a small external magnetic field should be small , leading to small or non - existent ` training ' effect .",

    "to conclude we considered the chiral ddw state in a bilayer where the sign of the @xmath7 component of the order parameter changes between the layers which is an energetically more favorable configuration .",
    "this also leads to the reversal of sign of @xmath9 in the bottom layer , thus breaking inversion symmetry .",
    "the calculations presented here are consistent with the unusual pke observed in high-@xmath5 materials . our calculations , although applied here specifically to the chiral ddw state , are more generally valid for any oaf with trs broken at each plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite similar ideas were applied to a tilted loop current model .",
    "in addition , the ideas presented here also apply to the bi - axial density wave recently seen in the pseudogap phase @xcite if they are accompanied by spontaneous currents @xcite .",
