    "it is generally believed that a coherent ( brightness temperatures up to @xmath1  k ) radio emission of pulsars is generated by plasma instabilities in the one - dimensional , relativistic plasma consisting of electron - positron pairs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such pairs may be produced by @xmath2-rays via electromagnetic cascades in the vicinity of the magnetic poles of pulsars that are identified with strongly magnetized ( @xmath3  g ) , rotation - powered neutron stars .",
    "created particles very rapidly lose the momentum component transverse to the magnetic field and flow away along the open magnetic field lines with lorenz - factors ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "a two - stream instability has been proposed as a mechanism of radio emission of pulsars soon after their discovery @xcite .",
    "later , using the available models of pulsar magnetospheres it was argued that if the plasma outflow is stationary , the two - stream instability does not have enough time to be developed before the plasma escapes the pulsar magnetosphere ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the process of pair creation near the pulsar surface is strongly nonstationary , and the pair plasma gathers into separate clouds spaced by @xmath6  cm along the direction of its outflow . in this case , at the distance @xmath7  cm from the neutron star fast ( @xmath8 ) particles of one plasma cloud overtake slow ( @xmath9 ) particles of the preceding cloud , and mutual overlapping of the clouds begins . in the overlapping region , there are , in fact , two steams of slow and fast particles , and the condition for the development of two - stream instability is created @xcite . for typical parameters of pair plasma in the pulsar magnetospheres",
    "the growth rate of the instability is quite sufficient for its development ( see below ) .",
    "the frequency of langmuir ( @xmath10 ) waves generated at the distance @xmath11 from the neutron star is a few ten times higher than the typical frequency of pulsar radio emission ( see @xcite and below ) .",
    "therefore , the wave frequency has to decrease significantly because of some processes to be compatible with the observational data . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the process of conversion of @xmath10 waves into _ low - frequency _ alfvn ( @xmath12 ) waves that can solve the high - frequency problem .",
    "we consider pair plasma in the external uniform magnetic field @xmath13 directed along the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the behavior of this plasma may be described by the vlasov and maxwell equations , @xmath15_z \\right ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_z } f_\\alpha = 0 , \\label{eq:01}\\ ] ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distribution function for the particles of type @xmath18 which is normalized so that @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the particle density , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the magnetic field perturbation , and @xmath23 is the current density .    our study of nonlinear phenomena will be performed in the frame of the weak turbulence theory .",
    "the particle distribution functions and the current density may be written in the perturbation manner , @xmath24 here the unperturbed distribution function @xmath25 is assumed to be stationary and homogenous .",
    "besides , we use the infinite magnetic field approximation ( for finite magnetic field effects , see @xcite ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath17 is one - dimensional in the velocity space ( @xmath26 ) and depends only on @xmath27 .",
    "technically , this means that only the @xmath14 component of @xmath28 is nonzero , @xmath29 in this case from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:01 ] ) and ( [ eq:05 ] ) we have @xmath30 @xmath31 where the angular brackets denote an average over one pulsation .    performing fourier transformation with respect to temporal and spatial variables ,",
    "( [ eq:09 ] ) for @xmath32 yields @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "the first ( @xmath36 ) and second ( @xmath37 ) order perturbations describe the linear dynamics of plasma and three wave resonant processes , respectively .    without lost of generality",
    "we assume that the wave vector @xmath38 lies in the @xmath39-plane . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:02 ] ) , ( [ eq:07 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] ) it can be shown that there are the following three fundamental modes of pair plasma ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the first one is the extraordinary wave with the electric field perpendicular to the @xmath40-plane .",
    "the other two modes are @xmath10 waves generated in the development of the two - steam instability and @xmath12 waves into which @xmath10 waves may be converted ( see below ) . for both these modes their electric fields lie in the @xmath41-plane .    in the infinite magnetic field approximation when only one component ( @xmath42 ) of the linear permittivity tensor is nonzero @xcite , @xmath43 for rather low wave numbers , @xmath44 the dispersion relations can be written in the form @xmath45 + k_x^2 c^2 \\frac{k_z^2 c^2}{2\\omega_p^2 \\langle \\gamma^{-3 } \\rangle } \\label{eq:15}\\ ] ] for quasi - longitudinal @xmath10 waves , and @xmath46 \\label{eq:16}\\ ] ] for quasi - transversal @xmath12 waves , where @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath50 .    if the conditions ( [ eq:17 ] ) are fulfilled for @xmath12 waves the ratio of their electric field components is @xmath51",
    "we consider the model where @xmath10 waves are generated by the two - stream instability that develops at the distance @xmath52 cm from the neutron star surface because of overlap of the pair plasma clouds ejected from the pulsar @xcite .",
    "below , all calculations are done in the plasma frame where the mean vector - velocity of the cloud particles is zero .",
    "we assume that in the regions where the plasma clouds overlap the densities of the slow and fast particles are the same ( for development of two - stream instability for arbitrary distribution function of plasma particles , see @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the lorentz - factor of the plasma frame in the pulsar frame is @xmath53 .",
    "the two - stream instability starts developing when the clouds overlapping is very slight , and in the overlapping regions the momentum spreads of the slow and fast particles are small @xcite , i.e. , the distribution function roughly is @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for @xmath10 waves with @xmath57",
    "the dispersion equation @xmath58 provides the maximum growth rate @xmath59 which is achieved at @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the particle velocity corresponding to the momentum @xmath62 . obliquely propagating @xmath10 waves ( @xmath63 )",
    "are also generated by the two - stream instability .",
    "for such waves with @xmath64 the growth rate is @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic frequency of generated @xmath10 waves is @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "when the amplitudes of generated @xmath10 waves become large enough linear approximation is not valid any more , and the lowest order nonlinear process called quasilinear relaxation starts up @xcite .",
    "this process may be described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:08 ] ) , and its characteristic time is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the coulomb logarithm . the quasilinear relaxation results in that the distribution function of particles has a shape of a plateau up to the lorentz - factor of @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 is @xmath71 at @xmath72 and nearly zero at @xmath73 .",
    "the further generation of @xmath12 waves is cut off .    after the stage of quasilinear relaxation the induced scattering of @xmath10 waves by plasma particles becomes the dominant nonlinear process @xcite .",
    "the characteristic time of this process is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the energy density of @xmath10 waves .",
    "the induced scattering transfers the wave energy from the frequency region where @xmath10 waves are generated ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) to the low frequency region ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , i.e. , the mean frequency of @xmath10 waves decreases @xmath80 times . here , we used that @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "the process of nonlinear conversion of @xmath10 waves into @xmath12 waves , @xmath85 ( and any other three - waves process ) is described by the second order current . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:07 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) this current can be written as @xmath86 where @xmath87 in general case when both @xmath10 and @xmath12 waves participate in the process .",
    "the distribution functions of electrons and positrons created via electromagnetic processes are identical . in such pair plasma",
    "all three - waves processes are absent .",
    "this is because the second order current @xmath88 is proportional to @xmath89 , and the summation in ( [ eq:24 ] ) over electrons and positrons gives @xmath90 .",
    "however , in the process of outflow of pair plasma along the curved magnetic field lines the distribution functions of electrons and positrons are shifted with respect to each other to maintain the electric neutrality of the plasma @xcite .",
    "this results in that the mean lorentz - factors of electrons ( @xmath91 ) and positrons ( @xmath92 ) slightly differ , @xmath93 .    for @xmath10 waves shifted to low frequency region by induced scattering",
    "there is no solution of the resonant conditions , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the process @xmath96 is kinematically forbidden , and we can omit all the terms proportional to @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) . taking into account that @xmath98 and @xmath99 for low - frequency @xmath10 waves and @xmath12 waves , respectively , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) and ( [ eq:24 ] ) we obtain @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the matrix element of interaction that together with the resonant conditions , @xmath102 totally determine the conversion process @xmath85 .",
    "dimensionless frequency of @xmath12 waves generated in the process @xmath85 as a function of @xmath14-component of dimensionless wave number of @xmath10 waves before their decay for different parameters : @xmath103 ( solid line ) , @xmath104 ( dashed line ) and @xmath105 ( dash - dotted line).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    to describe the frequency change in the process @xmath85 it is convenient to introduce the ration of the frequency of generated @xmath12 waves to the mean frequency of the low - frequency @xmath10 waves , @xmath106 .",
    "the results of numerical solution of the resonant conditions ( [ eq:27 ] ) are shown in figure  1 where the dimensionless wave number is used , @xmath107 .",
    "we can see that for the typical parameters the frequency of generated @xmath12 waves is about 2 orders of magnitude less then the mean frequency of @xmath10 waves . to clarify our numerical results presented in figure  1",
    "we can find the approximate analytical solution of the resonant conditions ( [ eq:27 ] ) for obliquely propagating @xmath10 waves , @xmath108 at @xmath109 . from this solution",
    "it follows that for rather small wave numbers of @xmath10 waves the frequency of generated @xmath12 waves is always much less than the characteristic frequency of @xmath10 waves .    using the standard technique of weak turbulence theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the characteristic time scale of nonlinear decay @xmath85 for the waves with random phases",
    "may be written as @xmath110",
    "if we assume that in the plasma frame the frequency of radio emission coincides with the mean frequency of @xmath10 waves generated by the two - stream instability at the distance @xmath11 , the characteristic frequency of the radio emission in the pulsar frame is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the magnetic field at the neutron star surface in units of @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the period of the pulsar rotation in units of @xmath115 , @xmath116  cm is the neutron star radius , and @xmath117 is a so - called multiplicity factor that equals to the ratio of the pair plasma density to the density of the primary particles @xcite . in early papers where only the curvature radiation of primary particles was considered as the mechanism of generation of @xmath2-rays the pair multiplicity is rather high , @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown that generation of @xmath2-rays by inverse compton scattering is essential near at least some pulsars @xcite . in this case",
    "the value of @xmath117 may be as small as @xmath119 . for plausible parameters ( e.g. , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 ) eq . ( [ eq:29 ] ) yields @xmath126 that is about an order of magnitude larger then the typical frequency of the pulsar radio emission .    in this paper",
    "we discussed the following sequence of processes in the magnetospheres of pulsars : ( a ) development of two - stream instability in collisions of plasma clouds and generation of @xmath10 waves ;",
    "( b ) quasilinear relaxation of two - stream instability ; ( c ) induced scattering of generated @xmath10 waves by plasma particles and decrease of the mean frequency of @xmath10 waves ; ( d ) nonlinear conversion of @xmath10 waves into low frequency @xmath12 waves . for plausible parameters of the pulsar plasma defined above and for @xmath127 and @xmath128",
    "the characteristic times of these processes in the plasma frame are @xmath129  s , @xmath130  s , @xmath131  s , and @xmath132  s , respectively .",
    "these times are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the characteristic time of the plasma outflow @xmath133  s. therefore , all these processes have enough time to be developed in the magnetospheres of pulsars .",
    "we have shown that the frequency of @xmath12 waves is a few ten times smaller than the frequency of generated @xmath10 waves and may be consistent with the observational data on the radio emission of pulsars .",
    "gedalin , gruman , and melrose @xcite proposed another mechanism of pulsar radio emission that also involves the two - stream instability and solves successfully the high frequency problem at least for the main part of known pulsars . in this mechanism obliquely propagating electromagnetic waves are directly generated by the instability . at present , the mechanism by gedalin et al .",
    "has an advantage over our mechanism because electromagnetic waves generated by their mechanism can escape from the magnetospheres of pulsars ( provided cyclotron absorption is unimportant ) while it was argued ( e.g. , @xcite ) that @xmath12 waves are subject to strong landau damping and can not be observed far from the pulsar ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the simple model used in @xcite it was assumed that the magnetosphere plasma is stationary , and the plasma density declines in proportion to @xmath134 without other variations .",
    "these assumptions are invalid in our case where the pair plasma outflow is nonstationary and strongly non - uniform across and along the magnetic field lines @xcite . at the edges of the plasma",
    "clouds the density falls down sharply and significantly , and @xmath12 waves may be converted into non - damping waves that escape as radio emission .",
    "besides , in the spaces between the plasma clouds the density and landau damping of @xmath12 waves may be small .",
    "a study of these effects is beyond the framework of this paper and will be addressed elsewhere .    in turn",
    ", our mechanism has an advantage over the mechanism by gedalin et al . for pulsars with the maximum of the radio spectra at very low frequencies ( @xmath135 mhz ) because the mean frequency of radio emission in our mechanism may be an order less than the same in the mechanism by gedalin et .",
