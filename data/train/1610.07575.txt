    "there is the following naive question from the early days of differential topology : given two closed smooth manifolds @xmath2 and @xmath3 , when does an isomorphism @xmath5 of integral cohomology rings imply that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are diffeomorphic ? this is generally regarded as an unlikely case , as in the 20th century topologists discovered many important series of manifolds for which the cohomology ring , or even the homotopy type , does not determine the diffeomorphism class .",
    "three - dimensional lens spaces , milnor s exotic spheres and donaldson s four - dimensional manifolds are prominent examples of different level of complexity .    we say that a family of closed smooth manifolds is _ cohomologically rigid _ if a cohomology ring isomorphism @xmath5 implies a diffeomorphism @xmath6 for any two manifolds in the family .",
    "in this paper we establish cohomological rigidity for two particular families of manifolds of dimension @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "each of these families arises from a particularly important class of combinatorial polytopes , which we refer to as the _ pogorelov class _",
    "it consists of simple @xmath7-dimensional polytopes which are flag and do not have 4-belts .",
    "in particular , polytopes in @xmath0 do not have triangular and quadrangular facets .",
    "the class @xmath0 includes combinatorial fullerenes , i.e. simple 3-polytopes with only pentagonal and hexagonal facets . by the results of pogorelov",
    "@xcite and andreev  @xcite , the class @xmath0 consists precisely of combinatorial @xmath7-polytopes which can be realised in lobachevsky space @xmath9 with right angles between adjacent facets ( _ right - angled @xmath7-polytopes _ for short ) .",
    "the conditions specifying the pogorelov class also feature as the `` no  @xmath10-condition '' and `` no  @xmath11-condition '' in gromov s theory of hyperbolic groups  @xcite .",
    "our first family consists of _ hyperbolic @xmath7-manifolds of lbell type_. these manifolds were introduced and studied by vesnin  @xcite .",
    "they arise from right - angled realisations of polytopes from the pogorelov class  @xmath0 ( see the details in subsection  [ sechyp ] ) .",
    "each hyperbolic @xmath7-manifold @xmath12 of lbell type is composed of @xmath13 copies of a polytope @xmath14 and is a _ small cover _ of @xmath1 in the sense of davis and januszkiewicz  @xcite .",
    "we prove ( in theorem  [ 3cohrigreal ] ) that two such manifolds @xmath12 and @xmath15 are diffeomorphic if and only if their @xmath16-cohomology rings are isomorphic .",
    "our second family arises from toric topology : it consists of quasitoric ( or topological toric ) manifolds whose quotient polytopes are in the class @xmath0 .",
    "these are @xmath8-dimensional smooth manifolds acted on by a @xmath7-torus @xmath17 with quotient @xmath14 .",
    "we show ( in theorem  [ 3cohrig ] and corollary  [ coro:5 - 1 ] ) that this family is cohomologically rigid , i.e. two manifolds @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the family are diffeomorphic if and only if their cohomology rings are isomorphic . in general a diffeomorphism between quasitoric manifolds @xmath2 and @xmath3 does not imply that the corresponding polytopes @xmath1 and @xmath4 are combinatorially equivalent , but this is the case when the quotient polytopes are in the class  @xmath0 ( see theorem  [ 3cohrig ] ) .",
    "our proofs use both combinatorial and cohomological techniques of toric topology , and build upon recent important results of fan , ma and wang on cohomological rigidity of moment - angle manifolds  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "these authors come to the class @xmath0 independently , by considering the property of @xmath18-rigidity for simple polytopes ( see section  [ cohrig ] ) .",
    "the class @xmath0 also featured in the work of buchstaber and erokhovets  @xcite on combinatorial classification of fullerenes .",
    "we note that cohomological rigidity is open for the whole family of toric or topological toric manifolds .",
    "in fact , we find it quite surprising that no counterexamples to the `` toric cohomological rigidity problem '' were found up to date .",
    "in real dimension  @xmath8 the families of quasitoric and topological toric manifolds coincide and contain strictly the family of toric manifolds ( smooth complete toric varieties ) .",
    "the family of quasitoric ( or topological toric ) manifolds whose quotient polytopes are in the class @xmath0 is large enough , as there is at least one quasitoric manifold over any simple @xmath7-polytope .",
    "indeed , the four colour theorem implies that any simple @xmath7-polytope admits a `` characteristic function '' ( see proposition  [ 4cprop ] ) ; this remarkable observation was made by davis and januszkiewicz in  @xcite .",
    "toric manifolds whose associated polytopes are in @xmath0 are fewer , but still abundant ; many concrete examples were produced recently by suyama  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are no _ projective _ toric manifolds whose associated polytopes are in  @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from a result of c.delaunay  @xcite that a delzant 3-polytope must have at least one triangular or quadrangular face .",
    "our results on cohomological rigidity of toric manifolds chime with the problem of diffeomorphism classification for simply connected oriented manifolds , which is a classical subject of algebraic and differential topology .",
    "the foundations of this classification in dimensions @xmath19 were laid in the works of browder and novikov ( see  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "novikov  @xcite showed that for a given simply connected oriented manifold  @xmath2 of dimension @xmath19 there are only finitely many manifolds @xmath3 for which there exists a homotopy equivalence @xmath20 preserving the pontryagin classes .",
    "important classification results in dimension @xmath8 were obtained in the works of wall  @xcite , jupp  @xcite and zhubr  @xcite .",
    "toric , quasitoric or topological toric manifolds @xmath2 are simply connected , and their cohomology rings @xmath21 are generated by @xmath22-dimensional classes . according to the general results mentioned above , two such manifolds in dimension @xmath8 are diffeomorphic if there is an isomorphism of their cohomology rings preserving the first pontryagin class  @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the toric cohomological rigidity problem in dimension @xmath8 reduces to establishing the invariance of @xmath23 under cohomology isomorphisms .",
    "this turns out to be a purely combinatorial and linear algebra problem , see details in section  [ class6 ] .",
    "however , we were not able to prove directly the invariance of @xmath23 under cohomology isomorphisms for toric manifolds over simple @xmath7-polytopes from the class  @xmath0 .",
    "one of our main results ( theorem  [ 3cohrig ] ) can be interpreted as a classification result for a particular family of simply connected @xmath8-dimensional manifolds , and its proof is independent of the general classification results of wall , jupp and zhubr .",
