    "the m4 core project with _ hst _ is a _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) large program ( go-12911 , pi : bedin ) designed to provide high - accuracy astrometry and photometry for stars in the core of the closest globular cluster ( gc ) m4 ( @xmath3=2.2kpc , harris1996 updated as in 2010 ) . the observations are designed to detect binary dark companions ( such as a black hole , a white dwarf , or a neutron star ) of bright ms stars by measuring the ` wobble ' of the luminous star around the center of mass of the binary system .    the exquisite photometry and astrometry provided by _ hst _ makes this dataset ideal for several other astrophysical applications including the search for variable stars or transiting exoplanets , the measure of absolute proper motions and annual parallax , the study of internal dynamics and of photometric binaries , and the search for intermediate - mass central black hole ( see bedin et al .  2013 , hereafter paper i , for an overview of the project ) .",
    "one of the main goals of the project is the investigation of multiple stellar populations in this cluster .",
    "several papers have been dedicated to the study of the different stellar generations host by m4 .",
    "spectroscopy has revealed that m4 stars have inhomogeneous content of c , n , o , al , and na ( e.g. gratton et al .",
    "1986 , wallerstein 1992 , drake et al .",
    "1992 , smith et al .",
    "2005 ) and exhibit na - o , al - o , and c - n anticorrelations ( e.g. ivans et al .",
    "1999 , marino et al .",
    "2008 , carretta et al .",
    "2009 , villanova & geisler 2011 ) . the distribution of [ na / fe ] and [ o / fe ] is bimodal , and the two groups of na - poor / o - rich and na - rich / o - poor stars , which are commonly associated with a first and a second stellar generation , populate two distinct red - giant branches ( rgbs , marino et al.2008 ) .",
    "the color distribution of horizontal - branch ( hb ) stars is also bimodal and is strictly related to the stellar populations : blue - hb stars share the same chemical composition as second - generation stars , while the red - hb stars are consistent with being first generation ( marino et al .",
    "photometric evidence of multiple populations in m4 ( marino et al.2008 , lee et al.2009 , monelli et al.2013 ) is based on the analysis of the rgb , while , so far , no evidence of multiple or extended ms has been found .    in a recent study of the massive gc ngc2808 , milone et al .",
    "( 2012a , hereafter m12a ) have demonstrated that the f110w and f160w filters of the infrared channel of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3/ir ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) are powerful tools to identify multiple sequences along the ms of very - low mass ( vlm ) stars .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) portion of the spectrum of cold m - dwarfs is very sensitive to the effects of molecules , in particular @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , nir photometry can provide unique information on multiple populations among vlm stars . in this paper",
    "we extend the study by m12a on ngc2808 to the less - massive gc m4 .",
    "we exploit the dataset available from go-12911 and from the _ hst _ archive to detect , for the first time , multiple stellar populations at the bottom of the ms of this gc .",
    "the dataset used in this paper consists in images obtained with the ir and ultraviolet and visual camera ( uvis ) of wfc3 and the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( wfc / acs ) of _ hst_. in addition , we used the photometric catalogs in f606w and f775w compiled by bedin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in their study of the m4 white - dwarf cooling sequence ( go-10146 , pi.l.bedin ) , and the photometric catalog in f467 m described in paperi .",
    "wfc3/ir data are archival _ hst _ images from program go-12602 ( pi.a.dieball ) .",
    "this data set consists of 16@xmath5652s exposures through f110w and 8@xmath5652s through f160w of a @xmath02@xmath52 arcmin field located at about 1.5 arcmin north - east from the cluster center .",
    "since the original goals of go-12602 project were the search for brown dwarfs in gcs and the study of the hydrogen - burning limit and the stellar / sub - stellar border of the ms , this dataset is optimized to get high - accuracy photometry of faint m - dwarfs .",
    "we also used wfc3/uvis 3@xmath5911s@xmath63@xmath5922s exposures in f390w from go-12602 ( pi.a.dieball ) and 4@xmath550s exposures in f814w from go-12311 ( pi.g.piotto ) .",
    "we corrected the poor charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) in the wfc3/uvis data by using the procedure by anderson & bedin(2010 ) .",
    "photometry and astrometry of wfc / ir images have been carried out by using a software package that is based largely on the tools presented in anderson & king ( 2006 ) .",
    "we corrected stellar positions for geometric distortion by using the solution developed by one of us ( j.a . ) .",
    "photometry has been calibrated as in bedin et al.(2005 ) by using online estimates for zero points and encircled energies .",
    "both the software package and geometric distortion correction tool will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "photometry and astrometry of wfc3/uvis have been determined as in paperi .",
    "the cmds have been corrected for differential reddening as in milone et al .",
    "( 2012b ) .",
    "first , we selected a subsample of stars by including only those cluster members that lie on the ms and are brighter than the the knee .",
    "we extracted the ms ridge line and for each star , we estimated how the 35 neighbouring stars in the subsample systematically lie to the red or the blue of the fiducial sequence . this systematic color and magnitude offset ,",
    "measured along the reddening line , is indicative of the differential reddening .",
    "we found that the reddening variation , within the field of view analyzed in this paper is smaller than @xmath7 mag , and is consistent with the degree of differential reddening measured by hendricks et al.(2012 ) and monelli et al.(2013 ) in the same region .",
    "stellar proper motions are determined by comparing the positions of stars measured at two different epochs from go-10146 acs / wfc data ( epoch : 2004.6 ) and go-12602 ir / wfc3 data ( epoch : 2012.3 ) , and by following a method that has been comprehensively described in other papers ( e.g.bedin et al.2003 , 2008 , anderson & van der marel2010 ) .",
    "the @xmath8 versus @xmath9 cmd ( hereafter nir cmd ) , corrected for differential reddening , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] for all the stars in the field of view .",
    "the inset shows the vector - point diagram ( vpd ) of proper motions in wfc3/ir pixel units .",
    "the fact that the absolute proper motion of m4 differs significantly from that of background / foreground stars makes proper motions measurements the tool of choice for separating field stars from cluster members ( see bedin et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we represent with black circles the stars that , according to their proper motion , are probable cluster members , while red crosses indicate field stars .",
    "a visual inspection of the cluster cmd reveals that below the turn off , over a range of @xmath02.5 f160w magnitudes ( @xmath10 ) , the ms is narrow and there are no evident signs of any large color spread or split . at fainter luminosities , below the ms knee",
    ", there is a dramatic change in the color distribution of ms stars , and the ms splits into two sequences .",
    "this section is dedicated to the analysis of these sequences of vlm stars , and we start by demonstrating that the bimodal color distribution in not entirely due to photometric errors .     versus @xmath9 cmd of stars in the wfc3/ir field of view . stars that are m4 members according to their proper motion are plotted as black points , while field stars are represented with red crosses .",
    "the inset shows the vector - point diagram ( in wfc3/ir pixel units ) of the proper motions for the same stars as shown in the cmd .",
    "the red circle is adopted to separate cluster members from field stars.,width=321 ]    to do this , an effective test consists of subdividing the available f110w , f160w , f606w and f775w images of the same field into two independent groups ( nir and visual ) and compare their cmds . if the color broadening is entirely due to photometric errors , a star that has bluer ( or redder ) colors in one cmd will have an equal probability of being red or blue in the second one .",
    "however , if the two sequences identified in the first data set have systematically different magnitudes and colors in the second one , the color broadening of the ms is more likely to be intrinsic .",
    "this procedure was introduced by anderson et al.(2009 ) in their analysis of the color spread among ms stars in 47tuc and is applied in the following to the case of m4 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : visual ] , we compare two cmds of the faint ms stars obtained from two independent datasets . the nir cmd is plotted in the upper - left panel and the @xmath11 versus @xmath12 cmd ( hereafter visual cmd ) is shown in the upper - right panel .",
    "reddening direction is indicated in each cmd by gray arrows .",
    "the length of each arrow corresponds to a reddening variation of @xmath13=0.17 mag that is about seven time larger than the maximum reddening variation observed in the m4 field studied in this paper .    in the nir cmd",
    "we have defined , by eye , two groups of @xmath1 and @xmath2 stars with @xmath14 that we have colored green and magenta , respectively . in the visual cmd",
    ", we kept for each star the same color as defined in nir : it is quite clear that the two groups of stars remain well separated .",
    "moreover , the evidence that @xmath1 stars have , on average redder @xmath12 color than @xmath2 stars but bluer @xmath9 color demonstrates that the color spread can not be due to residual differential reddening .    in order to strengthen this result , in each cmd",
    "we have derived a fiducial line of @xmath2 stars , which is represented as a continuous magenta line in fig .",
    "[ fig : visual ] .",
    "we than calculated the differences between the @xmath12 ( and @xmath9 ) colors of each star and the color of the fiducial at the same @xmath11 ( or @xmath8 ) magnitude .",
    "these color residuals are designated @xmath15(@xmath12 ) and @xmath16(@xmath9 ) .",
    "the verticalized @xmath8 versus @xmath17 and @xmath11 versus @xmath18 cmds are plotted in the panels ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath20 ) , respectively .",
    "panels ( @xmath21 ) and ( @xmath22 ) show the corresponding histogram of the color - residual distribution for the straightened @xmath1 and @xmath2 in three luminosity intervals . in addition , in panel ( e ) we show the anti - correlation between @xmath18 and @xmath17 color residuals .",
    "stars have on average bluer @xmath12 colors than @xmath1 stars with the same f775w magnitude .",
    "the color order is reversed in the nir cmd .",
    "this behaviour further confirms that the color broadening is an intrinsic feature of the faint ms of m4 .",
    "having excluded the possibility that the color spread of vlm ms stars is due to photometric errors , we can now estimate the fraction of stars in each of the two sequences . to do this we applied a procedure that has been widely used by our group ( e.g. piotto et al . 2007 ) and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] for m4 .",
    "we restrict our study to ms stars in the luminosity interval where the split ms is more clearly visible ( @xmath23 ) .",

    ", we found that the less - populated ms contains 36% , 44% , and 35% of stars , respectively .",
    "we infer that , on average , 38@xmath264% of stars belong to the less - populated @xmath1 , while the most - populated @xmath2 is made of the 62@xmath264% of stars .",
    "the error is estimated as the rms of the three independent estimates divided by the square root of two .",
    "marino et al .  ( 2008 ) , in their spectroscopic study of stellar populations along the rgb of m4 , concluded that 64@xmath2610% of the rgb stars are sodium rich and oxygen poor , while the remaining 36@xmath2610% ones have na and o abundance similar to those of halo - field stars with the same metallicity .",
    "we note that the fractions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 stars are identical , at one - sigma level , to the fractions of na - rich / o - poor and na - poor / o - rich stars , respectively . in the next section",
    ", we further investigate the connection between the observed sequences of m - dwarfs and the multiple stellar populations in m4 .",

    "<S> we compare our observations with those of ngc2808 , which is the only other gcs where multiple mss of very low - mass stars have been studied to date . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate synthetic spectra for m - dwarfs , assuming the chemical composition mixture inferred from spectroscopic studies of stellar populations along the red giant branch , and different helium abundances , and we compare predicted and observed colors . </S>",
    "<S> observations are consistent with two populations , one with primordial abundance and another with enhanced nitrogen and depleted oxygen .    </S>",
