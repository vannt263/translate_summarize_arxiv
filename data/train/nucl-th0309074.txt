    "experimental information concerning nuclear structure has been rapidly increasing in the region of unstable nuclei as well as stable nuclei .",
    "together with the increase of experimental data , microscopic calculations of nuclear structure have developed to describe those structure properties . for a systematic study of various types of structures covering a wide region of the nuclear chart ,",
    "the key issue in microscopic approaches is an extension of the model space .",
    "corresponding to the advancement of microscopic calculations , one must improve the effective forces so as to be suitable for extended model space .",
    "one of the basic properties of nuclei is saturation of the binding energy and density .",
    "the saturation property implies that a nucleus can be divided into fractional nuclei , and that such nuclei can fuse into a unified nucleus with only a small amount of energy .",
    "this `` easiness of assembling and disassembling nucleons''@xcite is one of the fundamental features of the nuclear many - body system . in nuclear - structure problems ,",
    "this dynamics appears as a variety of structures such as clustering of nucleons and mean - field formation .",
    "indeed , it is known that there exist many cluster states not only in stable nuclei , but also in unstable nuclei .",
    "this means that the basic dynamics of the nuclear structure contains two very different fundamentals .",
    "one is the formation of clusters , and the other is the formation of a mean field . with the traditional microscopic approaches , it was difficult to describe both of the features in one framework because of the limitation of the model space .",
    "typical mean - field approaches , such as hartree - fock(hf ) methods , are applicable to studying the mean - field aspect in the heavy nuclear region , while they are not suitable for studying cluster structure in light nuclei . on the other hand ,",
    "cluster features in light stable nuclei were studied by cluster models .",
    "recently , hybrid models , which can describe both the cluster aspect and the mean - field aspect , were developed and applied to structure studies of unstable nuclei as well as stable nuclei .",
    "one of the powerful approaches is a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) @xcite , which is able to describe two different dynamics , i.e. the clustering and the mean - field formation due to its ab initio nature . in the study of unstable nuclei in the @xmath2-shell and @xmath3-shell regions , performed with the amd @xcite method",
    ", it was found that both the cluster features and mean - field are essential in a systematic study of the ground and excited states of unstable nuclei as well as stable nuclei . as for an extended model based on three - dimensional hf calculations@xcite , a variation after the parity - projection method@xcite might describe a variety of structures in light nuclei . in a systematic study with such extended models ,",
    "the quality of the adopted effective interactions becomes an increasingly serious problem , because the structure is based on balance and competition between two different dynamics , like cluster formation and mean - field formation .",
    "this means that some theoretical results are sensitive to the adopted effective force , namely the hamiltonian , which governs the system . in other words ,",
    "the effective force must be appropriate to describe the characteristics of various states which may appear in the extended model space .    in microscopic calculations of nuclear structure ,",
    "one often uses the effective forces to solve nuclear many - body problems . in most of the phenomenological effective inter - nucleon forces , the dominant part is expressed by central forces . with the minnesota force @xcite and the volkov force @xcite , which consist of two - body central forces , the properties of very light nuclei are well reproduced .",
    "however , it is impossible to describe the saturation property of nuclear matter and heavy nuclei ( mass number @xmath4 ) with such two - body central forces . for satisfying the saturation properties , phenomenological density - dependent repulsive terms",
    "are usually imported in addition to the central two - body terms .",
    "such forces with a density dependence are gogny forces@xcite , skyrme - type forces@xcite and modified volkov forces@xcite , for example .",
    "these forces contain zero - range density - dependent operators or zero - range three - body operators .",
    "hf calculations with gogny forces and skyrme forces have succeeded in describing the bulk properties of the low - lying states of heavy nuclei .",
    "these forces , however , fail to reproduce the properties of very light nuclei .",
    "tohsaki introduced repulsive terms with finite - range three - body operators , and proposed new effective forces responsible for the microscopic @xmath5-cluster model , which succeeded to describe the overall properties over a wide range of masses from @xmath5 to nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "namely , the @xmath5-@xmath5 scattering behavior , the size and energy of double closed shell nuclei(@xmath5 , @xmath6o and @xmath7ca ) and the matter saturation property were successfully reproduced with tohsaki s forces . however , unfortunately , the forces contain too complicated three - body operators to be employed in practical microscopic calculations of general nuclei .",
    "our aim in this paper is to propose new effective inter - nucleon forces which are applicable to practical calculations of general nuclei with the amd method . in order to save computational costs",
    ", we introduce a simple three - body operator expressed by a one - range gaussian .",
    "the new forces are applied to microscopic calculations of @xmath0 nuclei up to @xmath7ca and neutron - rich o isotopes with the amd method .",
    "we explain the characteristics of the proposed forces and prove the success in describing the overall properties from the @xmath5 particle to nuclear matter , by demonstrating the results of the radii and energy of finite nuclei , the elastic @xmath5-@xmath5 scattering phase shift , and the saturation property of nuclear matter .",
    "we point out the significance of finite - range three - body terms in the effective forces from a phenomenological point of view , and discuss the role of the repulsive three - body terms in the connection with the tensor force , which is the origin of matter saturation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the new effective forces with a finite - range three - body term are proposed in [ sec : central ] .",
    "we describe the characteristics of the effective forces by demonstrating the calculated results with the new forces in [ sec : results ] . in [ sec : discuss ] , the significant role of the finite - range three - body term is discussed .",
    "finally , in [ sec : summary ] we summarize the present work .",
    "as mentioned above , for most of the phenomenological effective forces in microscopic models , the dominant part is the central force .",
    "concerning the effective central forces , it is regarded as a tensor force , a hard core and other terms in the bare interactions are renormalized because it is not easy to explicitly treat such terms in microscopic models for a nuclear many - body system . by categorizing the effective central forces into three types , we briefly review the general tendency of the typical effective forces to reproduce the structure properties , such as the saturation behaviour of nuclei and nuclear matter and the @xmath5+@xmath5 inter - cluster potential .",
    "\\(1 ) regarding finite - range two - body forces with no density - dependent terms , there exist such effective forces as minnesota@xcite and volkov@xcite forces which can reproduce the @xmath5+@xmath5 phase shift and the size and binding energy of an @xmath5 particle and light @xmath2-shell nuclei .",
    "however it is impossible to represent the saturation of matter and heavy nuclei with such the two - body central forces .",
    "\\(2 ) gogny@xcite forces , skyrme - type@xcite forces and modified volkov@xcite forces , which can guarantee nuclear matter saturation , contain zero - range density - dependent terms or zero - range three - body terms .",
    "gogny forces and skyrme - type forces successfully explain the size and the binding energy of the overall heavy nuclei , and also matter saturation . in spite of the success of nuclear matter saturation ,",
    "all of these effective forces fail to reproduce the size of the @xmath5 particle and the @xmath5-@xmath5 scattering behaviour .",
    "namely , all of these forces give larger @xmath5-particle sizes and a less @xmath5-@xmath5 inter - cluster potential than the experimental ones .",
    "therefore , the applicability of such forces to very light nuclei is not assured .",
    "\\(3 ) we know only one kind of the effective force which can simultaneously guarantee the size of @xmath5 particle , the @xmath5-@xmath5 phase shift , and the saturation properties of nuclei and nuclear matter . that is the third type of effective force containing finite - range three - body operators , proposed by tohsaki @xcite , namely , tohsaki s f1 and f2 forces .",
    "it was found that these effective forces can successfully reproduce the @xmath5-@xmath5 phase shift , the sizes and binding energy of double - closed nuclei up to @xmath7ca and also matter saturation point .    in the present paper",
    ", we propose new effective forces which can be classified into the last category ( 3 ) , forces with finite - range three - body operators . to reproduce the nuclear matter saturation properties , the effective central forces must contain density - dependent terms .",
    "it is considered that the origin of the density - dependent terms is suppression of the tensor force of bare nucleon - nucleon interactions in the nuclear matter . in other words ,",
    "the density - dependent terms are considered to phenomenologically simulate the medium effect that tensor force is suppressed in the nuclear matter because of the pauli principal . from this point of view",
    ", it seems to be reasonable that the effective central forces contain finite - range three - body terms because the original tensor force is the middle - range one .",
    "moreover , the type ( 2 ) forces with zero - range density - dependent terms have a fatal difficulty in simultaneously describing the density and the energy of an @xmath5 particle and nuclear matter .",
    "this failure in the quantitative reproduction of the saturation properties with type ( 2 ) forces is proved later in [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we propose effective central forces , @xmath8 expressed by two - body and three - body operators as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10   \\right\\rbrace +   v^{(2)}_3 \\exp\\left[-(\\frac{{\\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j}{a^{(2)}_3})^2 \\right ]    \\\\ & v^{(3)}_{ijk}=v^{(3 ) } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{{a^{(3 ) } } } \\left\\lbrace ( { \\bf r}_i-{\\bf r}_j)^2 + ( { \\bf r}_j-{\\bf r}_k)^2 + ( { \\bf r}_k-{\\bf r}_i)^2 \\right\\rbrace \\right ] .",
    "\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we adopt a simple operator for the finite - range three - body terms . compared with tohsaki s forces expressed by three - range three - body operators , this one - range three - body operator with a symmetric form in the present forces is suitable for practical microscopic calculations of general nuclei with the amd method .",
    "we propose a set of parameters for the ranges and strengths of the two - body and three - body terms .",
    "the dominant components of the two - body terms are the first term in eq.[eqn : f3b-2 ] .",
    "we adopt the same form as the volkov force for this term , which consists of a medium - range attractive gaussian and a short - range repulsive gaussian .",
    "wigner , bertlett , heisenberg and majorana terms are chosen to be same parameters as the common multiplier of these two range gaussians .",
    "the basic idea of the derivation of the parameters is that the nuclear structure properties over a wide mass number region should be described with a two - range two - body force and an one - range three - body force without mass - number depending parameters .",
    "we adopt the same range parameters for the two - range gaussian of the two - body force as the gogny force(@xmath11(fm ) and @xmath12(fm ) ) . with longer range parameters , we failed to obtain sufficient reproduction of the nuclear structure .",
    "although these range parameters for the two - body terms are shorter than the volkov and mv1 forces , the range of the inter - cluster potential is not so different from those given by the mv1 forces , as shown in later , due to the effect of the repulsive finite - range three - body term in the present force . in order to explain the nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shift , the form with a two - range two - body and an one - range three - body is too simple because of the restriction of the simplified three - body operator",
    "we add a small amount of a repulsive two - body term given by the second term of the two - body force in eq.[eqn : f3b-2 ] , @xmath13 $ ] , and tune again the strength of this term and the three - body term . in table",
    "[ tab : f3b ] , the proposed parameter sets of the present forces are presented .",

    "two sets case(1 ) and case(2 ) of parameters of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for wigner , bertlett , heisenberg and majorana terms are listed in table [ tab : f3b ] . comparing the case(1 ) and case(2 ) parameters , the triplet and singlet even components are same but the odd components different between two sets ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . as a result ,",
    "the case(1 ) and case(2 ) interactions give the same results for double closed @xmath0 nuclei written by ho wave functions , the @xmath5-@xmath5 interaction , and total energy of symmetric nuclear matter , however , they give different results for @xmath17 nuclei .",

    "it means that one can modify the value @xmath14 , which is suitable to his model wave function .    in practical amd calculations of @xmath0 nuclei and o isotopes",

    "the finite - range three - body terms in the phenomenological effective forces are important to describe the overall properties for nuclei for a broad range of masses . as mentioned in [ sec : results ] , and also already argued in the pioneering work by tohsaki @xcite , the finite - range three - body terms are empirically essential to simultaneously reproduce the properties of @xmath5-particle(size and @xmath5-@xmath5 phase shift ) and nuclear matter saturation .",
    "moreover , the finite - range feature is reasonable considering the original range of the tensor force , whose suppression effect in matter is simulated by the three - body terms . in order to explain the indispensability of the finite - range nature in three - body terms",

    "we try to search for a parameter set which can reproduce the empirical data of these four values .",

    "we also put a physical restriction , @xmath41 , that indicates that the long - range term must be attractive .",
    "the saturation points @xmath40 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha - matter ] .",
    "the upper panel indicates the saturation points in the case @xmath36 , and the lower panel corresponds to the case @xmath38 . under the conditions of the @xmath5-particle properties",
    ", the saturation points can not reach the empirical saturation point ( @xmath42 @xmath43 , @xmath44 mev ) in both cases , because the allowed area of the saturation points does not include the empirical one .",
    "this means that there is no reasonable parameter set which is able to simultaneously describe the saturation properties of an @xmath5 particle and nuclear matter . in other words , with `` zero - range '' density - dependent - type effective central forces , which explain the matter saturation point , it is difficult to describe the compact size of a real @xmath5 particle . from these results , we can conclude that the finite - range terms are indispensable to simultaneously reproduce the properties of @xmath5-particle and matter saturation .",
    "= 0.4      it has already been known that bare nucleon - nucleon interactions have leading tensor terms and hard cores , both of which are not easily treated in the microscopic calculations of nuclear many - body systems .",
    "instead , one usually adopts phenomenological effective nucleon - nucleon forces dominated by central forces with no hard cores .",
    "it is regarded that the tensor terms and hard cores are renormalized in the effective central forces .",
    "as already mentioned , the necessity of repulsive density - dependent terms of effective forces for describing the saturation properties originates from a suppression of the attractive tensor force in nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "in other words , the density dependence of the tensor force suppression is phenomenologically simulated by density - dependent repulsive terms in the effective central forces . from this point of view",
    ", we demonstrate a link between the effective forces and nucleon - nucleon(n - n ) scattering and discuss the role of the density - dependent repulsive terms .",
    "firstly , we reproduce the @xmath45-wave n - n scattering phase shift by the central two - body forces in the f3b force .",
    "second , we discuss the role of the residual part with the three - body term , which should be connected with the matter effect on the n - n interaction .",
    "we decompose the central part of the present effective force(f3b ) into two terms .",
    "one is a two - body term , @xmath46 , which can reproduce the @xmath45-wave nucleon - nucleon scattering behaviour , and the other is the residual term , @xmath47 , which contains the three - body term , defined as follows : @xmath48 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 mev .",
    "other interaction parameters in @xmath50 and @xmath51 are same as those of f3b force .",

    "therefore , we consider this @xmath52 as an effective force between bare nucleons , where the tensor force in the realistic interaction is renormalized in the central term .",
    "thus , the second term(@xmath47 ) in eq .",
    "[ eqn : decompose ] can be understood in terms of the matter effect in finite nuclei and nuclear matter . since the leading matter effect originates from a suppression of the tensor force",

    "this means that the density - dependent repulsive term(@xmath47 ) actually takes the role of tensor force suppression in nuclear matter .",
    "as mentioned above , the central effective force(f3b ) is decomposed into two parts , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in principle , it is easy to understand the decomposition if @xmath46 is same as the two - body term @xmath61 of the f3b force , and @xmath47 consists of only the three - body term of f3b .",
    "however , in the present analysis , @xmath46 is the modified one from the original @xmath62 , and @xmath47 involves a two - body term in addition to the dominant three - body term .",
    "we consider the reason as following way .",
    "the origin of the finite - range three - body term may not be the pure three - body effect but it also contains some component from the two - body central force .",
    "it is because of the restriction of the simple finite - range three - body operator , where we adopt a common range for the distances of all nucleon pairs in three - body term and omit spin - dependent terms for simplicity to apply to practical calculations with amd method . in order to overcome the restriction",
