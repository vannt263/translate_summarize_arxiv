    "random matrix theory was introduced to the theoretical physics community by wigner in his work on nuclear physics in the 1950s ( @xcite ) . since that time",
    ", the subject is an important and active research area in mathematics and it finds applications in fields as diverse as the riemann conjecture , physics , chaotic systems , multivariate statistics , wireless communications , signal processing , compressed sensing and information theory . in the last decades , a considerable amount of work has emerged in the communications and information theory on the fundamental limits of communication channels that makes use of results in random matrix theory @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "computing averages over certain matrix ensembles becomes extremely important in many situations . to be more specific ,",
    "consider the well known case of the single user mimo channel with multiple transmit and receive antennas . denoting the number of transmitting antennas by @xmath9 and the number of receiving antennas by @xmath10 ,",
    "the channel model is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transmitted vector , @xmath13 is the received vector , @xmath0 is a @xmath14 complex matrix and @xmath15 is the zero mean complex gaussian vector with independent , equal variance entries .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the complex conjugate transpose .",
    "it is reasonable to put a power constraint @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total transmitted power .",
    "the signal to noise ratio , denoted by @xmath20 , is defined as the quotient of the signal power and the noise power and in this case is equal to @xmath21 .    recall that if @xmath2 is an @xmath1 hermitian matrix then there exists @xmath22 unitary and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 . given a continuous function @xmath25 we define @xmath26 as @xmath27    naturally , the simplest example is the one where @xmath0 has independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "gaussian entries , which constitutes the canonical model for the single user narrow band mimo channel .",
    "it is known that the capacity of this channel is achieved when @xmath28 is a complex gaussian zero mean and covariance @xmath29 vector ( see for instance @xcite ) . for the fast fading channel , assuming statistical channel state information at the transmitter , the ergodic capacity is given by @xmath30={\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{e}}}\\big [ \\mathrm{tr}\\log({\\bf i}_{r}+\\mathrm{snr}{\\bf h}{\\bf h}^{*})\\big]\\ ] ] where in the last equality we use the fact that @xmath31 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite or @xcite for more details on this .",
    "another important performance measure is the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) achieved by a linear receiver , which determines the maximum achievable output signal to interference and noise ratio ( sinr ) . for an input vector @xmath32 with i.i.d .",
    "entries of zero mean and unit variance the mse at the output of the mmse receiver is given by @xmath33 = { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{e}}}\\big[\\mathrm{tr}\\big({\\bf i}_{t}+\\mathrm{snr}{\\bf h}^{*}{\\bf h}\\big)^{-1}\\big],\\ ] ] where the expectation on the left hand side is over both the vectors @xmath32 and the random matrices @xmath0 , while the right hand side is over @xmath0 only .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on this .",
    "there is a big literature and history of work on averages over gaussian ensembles ; see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "in @xcite the capacity of the gaussian channel was computed as an improper integral .",
    "this integral is difficult to compute and asymptotic and simulation results are provided . in @xcite several asymptotic results for large complex gaussian random matrices are studied in connection with wireless communication and information theory . in @xcite many aspects of correlated gaussian matrices are addressed , in particular the capacity of rayleigh channel was computed as the number of antennas increases to infinity .",
    "the books @xcite are excellent introductions to random matrix theory and their applications to physics and information theory . in @xcite",
    "the spectral eigenvalue distribution for a random infinite @xmath34-regular graph was computed .",
    "the typical approach in computing averages over random matrices is to consider the asymptotic behavior as the size of the matrix increases to infinity . in this work",
    "we contribute to this area by providing a unified framework to express the ergodic mutual information , the mse at the output of the mmse decoder and other types of functionals of a single user mimo channel , when the number of transmitting and receiving antennas are equal and finite .",
    "we do not rely on asymptotic results as the number of antennas increases .",
    "the results shown in this work are new and novel to the best knowledge of the author and they were not discovered before .    in section [ sec_prelim ] , we present some preliminaries in schur polynomials that are later used in this work . in section [ sec_main ] , we prove the main result of the paper , theorem [ main ] .",
    "this theorem provides a new formula for the expectation @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is positive definite matrix and @xmath25 a continuous function such that @xmath36 for every @xmath5 .",
    "notice that , as previously stated , taking @xmath7 gives another formula for the capacity of the mimo communication channel , and taking @xmath8 gives the mmse achieved by a linear receiver .",
    "we also discuss some applications and present some examples .",
    "a symmetric polynomial is a polynomial @xmath37 in @xmath38 variables such that if any of the variables are interchanged one obtains the same polynomial .",
    "formally , @xmath19 is a symmetric polynomial if for any permutation @xmath39 of the set @xmath40 one has @xmath41 symmetric polynomials arise naturally in the study of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients , since the coefficients can be given by a symmetric polynomial expressions in the roots .",
    "symmetric polynomials also form an interesting structure by themselves .",
    "the resulting structures , and in particular the ring of symmetric functions , are of great importance in combinatorics and in representation theory ( see for instance @xcite for more on details on this topic ) .",
    "the schur polynomials are certain symmetric polynomials in @xmath38 variables .",
    "this class of polynomials are very important in representation theory since they are the characters of irreducible representations of the general linear groups .",
    "the schur polynomials are indexed by partitions .",
    "a partition of a positive integer @xmath38 , also called an integer partition , is a way of writing @xmath38 as a sum of positive integers .",
    "two partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered to be the same partition .",
    "therefore , we can always represent a partition @xmath42 of a positive integer @xmath38 as a sequence of @xmath38 non - increasing and non - negative integers @xmath43 such that @xmath44 notice that some of the @xmath43 could be zero .",
    "integer partitions are usually represented by the so called young s tableaux ( also known as ferrers diagrams ) .",
    "a young tableaux is a finite collection of boxes , or cells , arranged in left - justified rows , with the row lengths weakly decreasing ( each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor ) .",
    "listing the number of boxes on each row gives a partition @xmath42 of a non - negative integer @xmath38 , the total number of boxes of the diagram .",
    "the young diagram is said to be of shape @xmath42 , and it carries the same information as that partition . for instance , in figure [ young ] we can see the young tableaux corresponding to the partition @xmath45 of the number 10 .",
    ".,width=132 ]    given a partition @xmath42 of @xmath38 @xmath46 the following functions are alternating polynomials ( in other words they change sign under any transposition of the variables ) : @xmath47 \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\sigma\\in s_n}\\epsilon(\\sigma)x_{\\sigma(1)}^{d_1}\\cdots x_{\\sigma(n)}^{d_n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the permutation group of the set @xmath49 .",
    "since they are alternating , they are all divisible by the vandermonde determinant @xmath50 the schur polynomial associated to @xmath42 is defined as the ratio : @xmath51 this is a symmetric function because the numerator and denominator are both alternating , and a polynomial since all alternating polynomials are divisible by the vandermonde determinant ( see @xcite for more details here ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath52 and @xmath53    another definition we need for the next section is the so called hook length , @xmath54 , of a box @xmath55 in young diagram of shape @xmath42 .",
    "this is defined as the number of boxes that are in the same row to the right of it plus those boxes in the same column below it , plus one ( for the box itself ) .",
    "for instance , in figure [ young2 ] we can see the hook lengths of the partition @xmath45 .",
    "the product of the hook s length of a partition is the product of the hook lengths of all the boxes in the partition .     with its corresponding hook s lengths.,width=132 ]",
    "we recommend the interested reader to consult @xcite for more details and examples on this topic .",
    "let @xmath56 be the set of all @xmath1 complex matrices and @xmath57 the set of @xmath1 unitary complex matrices .",
    "let @xmath58 be the lebesgue measure on @xmath56 and let @xmath59 be the gaussian measure on @xmath56 .",
    "this is the induced measure by the gaussian random matrix with complex independent and identically distributed entries with zero mean and unit variance in the set of matrices , when this is represented as an euclidean space of dimension @xmath60 .",
    "note that this probability measure is left and right invariant under unitary multiplication ( i.e. , @xmath61 for every unitary @xmath22 ) .",
    "the following theorem can be found in page 447 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite[teo_mac ] for every @xmath62 hermitian @xmath1 matrices and every partition @xmath42 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the product of the hook ",
    "lengths of @xmath42 .",
    "denote by @xmath65 the partition @xmath66 with @xmath67 ones .",
    "it is a well known fact in matrix theory ( see @xcite or @xcite ) that for every hermitian @xmath1 matrix @xmath2 and for every integer @xmath68 @xmath69 note that for the case @xmath70 , even though the sum is up to the @xmath71 term , all the terms between @xmath72 and @xmath71 are zero . in particular ,    * @xmath73 * @xmath74 * @xmath75 * @xmath76 .    the constant @xmath77 is equal to @xmath78 ( see @xcite for a proof of this formula ) . therefore , @xmath79    for every @xmath5 let us define the following class of functions @xmath80 this is a hilbert space with respect to the inner product @xmath81 moreover , polynomials are dense with respect to this norm ( see chapter 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath82 be the set of continuous functions in @xmath83 and let @xmath84 be the intersection of all the @xmath82 , @xmath85 note that the family @xmath84 is a very rich family of functions .",

    "in particular , @xmath86 .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath2 be an @xmath1 positive definite matrix and let @xmath87 be the set of eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",

    "let @xmath97 and @xmath98 be two polynomials .",
    "it is clear that @xmath99 and @xmath100 for every @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , both sides of the equation ( [ trf ] ) are linear and it is enough to prove the theorem for the case @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",

    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that for every partition @xmath107 @xmath108 therefore , we can deduce that @xmath109 we can see by direct examination that the hook  length of the partition @xmath106 is equal to @xmath110 hence , @xmath111 since @xmath2 is a positive definite matrix , by the spectral theorem there exists @xmath22 unitary and @xmath112 diagonal such that @xmath24 . note that the @xmath113 are the eigenvalues of @xmath2 . by definition of the schur polynomials @xmath114 where @xmath90 is",
