    "gilbert damping @xcite , which is spatially local and was introduced to describe the energy dissipation in magnetization dynamics , is a phenomenological parameter of magnetic materials although a microscopic theory based on the spin - orbit interaction and disorder scattering is available @xcite .",
    "the energy dissipation plays an important role in both current - driven @xcite and field - driven @xcite magnetization dynamics . for example , in the field - driven domain wall ( dw ) propagation in a magnetic wire , the propagation speed is proportional to the energy dissipation rate @xcite .",
    "thus a comprehensive understanding of dissipation ( damping ) in magnetic materials is not only fundamentally interesting , but also technologically important since the performance of many spintronic devices such as race - track memory @xcite is directly related to the dw propagation speed . in the past several decades ,",
    "the progress in our understanding of the damping has greatly advanced both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "theoretically , the gilbert damping of real materials can be calculated by using the torque - correlation model @xcite , kubo formalism @xcite and the scattering approach @xcite in combination with the first - principles electronic structures . in experiments ,",
    "the value of gilbert damping can be measured by ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) @xcite . for a nonuniform magnetic structure ( noncollinear magnetization ) such as a dw in a ferromagnetic wire ,",
    "fmr is not applicable and the gilbert damping is usually extracted via measuring the field - driven dw velocity @xcite .",
    "this technique is based on the following general features of the field - driven dw propagation : below a critical field , a dw propagates like a rigid body and its velocity is proportional to the external field and inversely proportional to the gilbert damping @xcite . surprisingly , the extracted gilbert damping coefficient of permalloy ( @xmath0 ) from field - driven dw motion is three times larger than the value of the same material from fmr measurement @xcite .",
    "the enhanced damping in magnetic dw has been attributed to the surface roughness of a ferromagnetic nanowire in combination with texture - enhanced gilbert damping arising from spin pumping @xcite .",
    "spin pumping was first proposed to understand the gilbert damping enhancement in a thin ferromagnetic film in contact with a nonmagnetic metal @xcite .",
    "a precessional magnetization @xmath1 pumps an electron spin current of polarization @xmath2 into the nonmagnetic metal that dissipates via spin - flip scattering @xcite .",
    "spin pumping does not have any observable effect in a homogeneous magnetic structure because the net inflow / outflow spin current anywhere in the system is zero due to a precise cancellation of the pumped spin currents in opposite directions . in noncollinear magnetization ,",
    "the partial cancellation of the spatially dependent spin pumping gives rise to a nonzero net inflow / outflow @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this results in an extra torque that has nonlocal damping in nature , different from the local gilbert damping due to spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the total damping of a nonuniform magnetic structure such as a spin spiral and a dw is enhanced through spin pumping @xcite or spin wave emission @xcite .",
    "the enhanced damping in nonuniform magnetic structure of permalloy has been quantitatively calculated from the first - principles , which depends not only on the magnetization gradient , but also on the particular dynamical modes @xcite .",
    "the torque due to the pumped spin current from precessional noncollinear magnetization can be decomposed into a longitudinal and a transverse components , which were independently predicted by several groups around the same time .",
    "_ @xcite and zhang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the longitudinal spin current increases the effective damping in spin spirals and dws .",
    "_ @xcite discovered that the transverse spin current influences the dissipation of spin waves .",
    "many previous works in literature only include the longitudinal component .",
    "@xcite for the field - driven transverse dw motion , the first - principles calculation showed that the transverse and longitudinal spin currents are responsible for the rigid - body motion below a critical field and the oscillatory motion above the critical field , respectively @xcite . for more complicate magnetic structures with noncollinear magnetization , e.g. vortex dws , how this extra nonlocal damping influences magnetization dynamics is not entirely clear .",
    "for example , it was predicted that the longitudinal component of the pumped spin current has no effect on steady - state dw motion @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", micromagnetic simulation showed that the longitudinal component can slow down the field - driven dw propagation as what was observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency in the theory and experiment requires a better understanding of the effects of the nonlocal damping on the dw motion .    in this paper , the complete form of the nonlocal damping",
    "is derived from physically transparent spin pumping formalism and is incorporated into a generalized thiele equation ( gte ) , which describes the steady - state motion of a nonuniform magnetic structure .",
    "we focus on the consequences on propagation of different types of dws resulting from the nonlocal damping .",
    "the solutions of the gte explicitly show the role played by the nonlocal damping in dw motion , where the longitudinal and transverse components are equally important in general . for the steady motion of a dw driven by an external field ,",
    "the longitudinal component vanishes while the transverse one slows down the dw velocity and increases the walker breakdown field .",
    "the experimentally observed dependence of the dw mobility on the damping parameter , which were systematically lower than the values from micromagnetic simulations , can be understood by including the nonlocal damping . as a prerequisite ,",
    "quantitative extraction of current - induced torques in noncollinear magnetization dynamics relies on an accurate description of nonlocal damping in analytical models and micromagnetic simulations .",

    "@xcite with the adiabatic approximation , in which the polarization of the spin current is assumed to align with local magnetization , the transverse spin current is artificially neglected .",
    "this approximation is also used in some later works @xcite without a proper justification .",
