    "cancer is a complex and robust system ; thus , it may remain an incurable disease despite the efforts to develop effective anticancer therapies @xcite .",
    "understanding of the origin of cancer robustness is an important topic of scientific inquiry not only for researchers in the field of basic biology but also for investigators in medical research .",
    "network biology @xcite and network medicine @xcite are helpful for untangling complex systems such as cancers .",
    "the biomolecules of living organisms , such as proteins and metabolites , undergo several interactions and chemical reactions , which lead to the occurrence of various life phenomena @xcite .",
    "these interactions can be represented in the form of networks or graphs .",
    "cancer behaviors are governed and coordinated by these interactions between biomolecules ( i.e. , cancer signaling networks ) @xcite . in recent years",
    ", several new technologies and high - throughput methods have generated a massive quantity of data on signaling networks , thus , the understanding of cancer signaling networks is progressively becoming clearer .",
    "in addition , the data on signaling networks are accumulated in several databases such as the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ( kegg ) @xcite . as a result , investigators have been able to actively carry out comprehensive data analyses in an ongoing attempt to shed light on the understanding of cancer robustness .",
    "the relationship between network structures and their robustness is well investigated in network biology ( or network science @xcite , in general ) .",
    "especially , it is well known that heterogeneous connectivity ( or scale - freeness ) , which indicates that a few nodes ( hubs ) integrate numerous nodes while most of the remaining nodes do not , promotes the network robustness against random failures because of hubs , but it leads to the fragility of networks under the condition of targeted attacks to hubs @xcite .",
    "the related works are summarized by @xcite .",
    "inspired by these previous studies , @xcite focused on 13 types of cancers , which are available in the kegg database , and they found that the patient survivability , which is interpreted as cancer vulnerability because more robust cancers may be more incurable , is correlated with the degree of heterogeneous connectivity of cancer signaling networks .",
    "however , this conclusion has several limitations .",
    "especially , the prostate cancer was excluded when investigating a correlation between the patient survivability and heterogeneous connectivity of cancer signaling networks because it has minimal vasculature and morphologically distinct .",
    "@xcite reported that such a negative correlation is not concluded when the prostate cancer also included , suggesting a limitation of heterogeneous connectivity as a descriptor of the patient survivability .",
    "in addition to this , biological robustness is described in a different context : modularity , which , in essence , reflects the deconstruction of a network into dense , and yet , weakly interconnected subnetworks @xcite .",
    "modularity may be related to robustness or capability of quickly adapting to changing environments ( i.e. , modularity  robustness hypothesis ) @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that modular networks spontaneously evolve when the evolutionary goal changes over time in a manner that preserves the same subgoals but in different permutations using a theoretical model .",
    "similarly , @xcite suggested that changing environments can promote modularity .",
    "@xcite showed that modularity evolves in biological networks ( metabolic networks in this study ) in order to deal with a multitude of functional goals , with a degree depending on environmental variability .",
    "moreover , @xcite also derived similar conclusions on the relationship between metabolic network modularity and changes in the chemical environment , which they specifically defined as the availability and source of carbon - based molecules , using flux balance analysis .",
    "the conclusion that environmental variability ( or changing environments ) promotes network modularity is partially supported by the data analysis of real - world biological ( metabolic ) networks @xcite .",
    "these findings imply that more modular networks are more robust ( i.e. , have a potential of the adaptation to changing environments ) . in this context",
    ", a functional and/or evolutionary goal is interpreted as survival of cancer cells under a condition such as drug dosage and radiation exposure . taken together ,",
    "a signaling network of a more incurable cancer is expected to show a higher modularity .    in this study , therefore , we evaluate whether the hypothesis that network modularity is related to robustness is applicable to cancers using network analysis , and show that network modularity is a better descriptor of patient survivability",
    ". moreover , we discuss insights into cancer evolution ( environmental adaptation ) and treatments from a viewpoint of modularity .",
    "according to the list of cancer types ( i.e. , table 1 ) in the previous study by @xcite , we manually downloaded the kgml ( kegg markup language ) files containing the signaling network data of 14 cancer types on june 25 , 2012 from the kegg database @xcite , and constructed the cancer signaling networks in which nodes and edges are proteins and relations between proteins such as protein  protein interactions and signaling flows .",
    "although the cancer signaling networks shown in the kegg database have directed relationships ( i.e. , edges ) , the direction of edges is neglected ( i.e. , the signaling networks are represented as undirected networks ) in this study , as in the previous study by @xcite , because they are not required when calculating the following network parameters .",
    "in addition to this , we obtained the average 5-year survival rate of cancer patients according to the previous study by @xcite .",
    "the survival rate of cancer patients was originally extracted from the surveillance epidemiology and end results ( seer ) program database @xcite ( http://seer.cancer.gov/ ) , which provides information on cancer statistics compiled by the national cancer institute .",
    "the network parameters , investigated in this study , are explained .",
    "@xcite focused on the degree entropy for measuring network complexity .",
    "the degree entropy is a kind of _ graph entropy _ , which is often used to evaluate network complexity ( reviewed by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the graph entropy of network @xmath0 is based on shannon s entropy , and it is conceptually defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 corresponds to a network invariant such as the total number of nodes or the total number of edges . the network is divided into @xmath3 subsets , based on a given criterion , and the value @xmath4 denotes the cardinality of subset @xmath5 .",
    "the degree entropy @xmath6 is a simple example of graph entropy , and it is based on the node degree @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be the number of nodes with degree @xmath8 ; the degree entropy @xmath6 is given as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of nodes . since @xmath11 ( i.e. , the degree distribution ) , this equation is rewritten as @xmath12 .",
    "that is , the degree entropy @xmath6 characterizes the degree of heterogeneity in a network .",
    "the modularity of networks is often measured using the @xmath13-value , which is widely used for investigating network modularity ( e.g. , reviewed by @xcite ) .",
    "the network modularity @xmath13 is defined as the fraction of edges that lie within , rather than between , modules relative to that expected by chance as follows : @xmath14\\delta(c_i , c_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath15 if nodes @xmath5 and @xmath16 belong to the same module and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "@xmath18 corresponds to the number of edges , and @xmath19 is an adjacency matrix .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the number of neighbors ( i.e. , node degree ) of node @xmath5 .",
    "a network with a higher @xmath13 indicates a higher modular structure .",
    "thus , we have to find the global maximum @xmath13 over all possible divisions . since it is hard to find the optimal division with the maximum @xmath13 in general , approximate optimization techniques are required @xcite . in this study ,",
    "an algorithm based on simulated annealing @xcite was used for finding the maximum @xmath13 in order to avoid the resolution limit problem in community ( or module ) detection @xcite as much as possible .",
    "the maximum @xmath13 is defined as the network modularity of cancer signaling networks .    to allow the comparison of network modularity with networks of different size and connectivity",
    ", we used the normalized network modularity value @xmath21 based on the previous studies by @xcite , which was defined as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the network modularity of a real - world signaling network and @xmath24 is the average network modularity value obtained from 10000 randomized networks constructed from its real - world network .",
    "@xmath25 was estimated as : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of modules in the real network .",
    "randomized networks were generated from a real - world network using the edge - rewiring algorithm @xcite .",
    "this algorithm generates a random network by rewiring 2 randomly selected edges until the rewiring of all edges is completed .",
    "for example , consider 2 edges , a  b and c  d , where the letters and lines are nodes and edges , respectively . through this edge - rewiring algorithm , the edges a  d and c",
    " b are obtained ( see the study by @xcite for details ) .      the clustering is also considered because its concept is similar to that of the network modularity . to measure the clustering effects , the clustering coefficient @xcite was proposed .",
    "this measure denotes the density among neighbors of node @xmath5 , and is defined as the ratio of the number of edges among the neighbors to the number of all possible connections among the neighbors : @xmath28 @xmath29 is the number of edges among neighbors of node @xmath5 . in this study",
    ", we focused on the overall tendency of clustering that is measured by the average clustering coefficient : @xmath30\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i$ ]",
    ". note that @xmath31 only focused on the clustering effect among neighboring nodes unlike the network modularity @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the largest connected component ( giant component ) was extracted from each cancer signaling network after adding edges between proteins belonging to the same protein complex ( i.e. , protein  protein interactions ) in order to obtain more accurate calculations of @xmath13 and @xmath31 and to avoid bias from small isolated components .",
    "especially , the module detection algorithm requires connected undirected networks .      for measuring statistical dependence between the 5-year survival rate and network parameters",
    ", we used the spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath32 , which is a non - parametric measure ( i.e. , it is relatively robust to outliers and can be also consider nonlinear relationships ) , and its @xmath33-value @xmath34 .",
    "a correlation between the degree entropy @xmath6 and the 5-year survival rate of patients was re - confirmed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deg_entropy ] ) .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite , the degree entropy shows a negative correlation with the survival rate when the prostate cancer is neglected .",
    "this result suggests that the signaling networks of cancers with higher patient survivability show a lower heterogeneous connectivity . in general",
    ", since cancer treatments are interpreted as targeted attacks to hub proteins such as p53 @xcite , a famous cancer - related hub protein , such target proteins may be easily found in networks with a higher heterogeneous connectivity . on the other hand , target proteins may be hardly identified in networks with a lower heterogeneous connectivity because such networks have striking structural properties like random networks .     and the 5-year survival rate .",
    "a significant correlation is not concluded ( spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath35 and @xmath33-value @xmath36 ) when considering all 14 cancer types ; however , a significant negative correlation is observed when the prostate cancer ( open circle ) is excluded ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) . ]",
    "however , this discussion is debatable because a negative correlation between the degree entropy @xmath6 and the survival rate is not concluded when considering all 14 cancer types ( fig . [",
    "fig : deg_entropy ] ) although @xmath32 is relatively robust to outliers .",
    "especially , the prostate cancer has a higher patient survivability than expected from the degree entropy @xmath6 .",
    "on the other hand , the modularity - related network parameters are more robustly correlated with the 5-year survival rate of patients ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modularity ] ) .",
    "in particular , the normalized network modularity @xmath21 shows a significant negative correlation with the survival rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modularity]b ) even if the prostate cancer is also considered although the prostate cancer still seems to be an outlier .",
    "note that the modularity value was normalized to allow the comparison of the network modularity with networks of different sizes and connectivity , which strongly affect @xmath13 .",
    "thus , there was no correlation of @xmath21 with the number of nodes ( @xmath10 ) ( spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath39 , @xmath33-value @xmath40 ) or the number of edges ( @xmath18 ) ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath21 was not correlated with average degree ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) .",
    "the normalization is an important procedure because it is slightly difficult to conclude a negative correlation between the original modularity @xmath13 and the survival rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modularity]a ) .",
    "the average clustering coefficient @xmath31 shows a positive correlation with the patient survivability ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modularity]c ) .",
    "this tendency is not conflict with the negative correlation between @xmath21 and the survival rate because @xmath31 only characterizes the clustering effect among neighbors .",
    "for example , a complete graph shows the high @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) ; however , the modularity @xmath13 is 0 ; thus , an opposite tendency may be observed between @xmath13 and @xmath31 . in this manner",
    ", these network parameters indicate modular structure of networks in a different context .",
    "in fact , the relationship between the normalized modularity @xmath21 and the clustering coefficient @xmath31 was not concluded ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "( a ) ( spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath49 and @xmath33-value @xmath50 ) , normalized modularity @xmath21 ( b ) ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , and the average clustering coefficient @xmath31 ( c ) ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) . when the prostate cancer ( open circle ) is excluded , the 5-year survival rate shows a more significant correlation with @xmath13 ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , @xmath21 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , and @xmath31 ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) , respectively . ]",
    "the correlations of @xmath13 , @xmath21 , and @xmath31 with the 5-year survival rate are more significant if the prostate cancer is neglected ( figs .",
    "[ fig : modularity ] and [ fig : bar_rs2 ] ) . especially , the squared correlation coefficient @xmath59 is almost similar between the degree entropy @xmath6 and the network modularity values @xmath13 or @xmath21 .",
    "this result suggests that the network modularity ( @xmath21 , in particular ) is a better descriptor for explaining the cancer patient survivability .     of the 5-year survival rate with the degree entropy @xmath6 , the modularity @xmath13 , the normalized modularity @xmath21 , and the average clustering coefficient @xmath31 .",
    "one asterisk and two asterisks on the top of bars indicate that @xmath33-value for @xmath32 is less than 0.05 and less than 0.01 , respectively .",
    "the black bars and gray bars correspond to @xmath59 for all cancer types and @xmath59 observed when the prostate cancer is excluded , respectively . ]",
    "the normalized network modularity @xmath21 and the degree entropy @xmath6 are different structural properties because of no correlation between them ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cor_qm_h ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath31 is related to the degree entropy @xmath6 ( spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath60 and @xmath33-value @xmath61 ) because these network parameters are computed based on node degrees .",
    "this result implies that the positive correlation between @xmath31 and the survival rate likely to be a side effect of the negative correlation between @xmath6 and the survival rate .",
    "thus , we concluded that the modularity value @xmath21 is the best descriptor in this study .",
    "and the normalized modularity @xmath21 ( spearman s rank correlation coefficient @xmath62 and @xmath33-value @xmath63 ) . ]    to evaluate the contribution of each network property to the patient survival rates , we conducted a kernel partial least squares ( pls ) regression analysis @xcite using a statistical software r version 3.0.0 @xcite and with its function plsr , which is available in the r package pls version 2.3 - 0 .",
    "the pls are more powerful than than other multivariate analysis techniques .",
    "in particular , the pls are powerful for extracting relative factors for objective variables from a large number of explanatory variables when a high level of multicollinearity is observed among the explanatory variables .",
    "the loadings plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : biplot ] ) suggests the patient survival rates is mainly explained by the component 1 in which the loadings are @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this result indicates that the modularity - related measures are more dominant than the degree entropy @xmath6 for explaining the patient survival rates , and it is a more convincing evidence of the conclusion derived from the correlation analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_rs2 ] ) .",
    "however , we conclude that both network properties can contribute to the patient survivability because the difference of the loadings between @xmath6 and the modularity - related measures is not so large .",
    "rather , we emphasize the loading vectors are different between the modularity - related measures and @xmath6 .",
    "this result represents the different tendency of the contribution to the cancer patient survivability between the network parameters , and it implies that modularity - related measures are essentially different from @xmath6 .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by no correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cor_qm_h ] ) .",
    "in summary , we showed that the cancer patient survivability is correlated with not only the degree of heterogeneous connectivity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : deg_entropy ] ) but also the network modularity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modularity ] ) , as expected from the hypothesis that modularity enhances robustness ( e.g. , capability of quickly adapting to changing environments ) , suggested by several theoretical and data analytic studies .",
    "especially , the network modularity more robustly explains the cancer patient survivability than the heterogeneous connectivity does ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bar_rs2 ] ) because a correlation between the network modularity @xmath21 and the survival rate is still concluded even if the prostate cancer is considered . in the previous study by @xcite , the prostate cancer was neglected because it is an exception due to their morphological differences .",
    "thus , the network modularity is more widely useful for understanding cancer behaviors than the heterogeneous connectivity from a viewpoint of molecular signaling networks .",
    "however , this result does not contradict the importance of the heterogeneous connectivity in the prediction of cancer survival rates .",
    "the pls analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : biplot ] ) suggests the contribution of both heterogeneous connectivity and modularity to the patient survivability although the degree of the contribution of the modularity is higher than that of the heterogeneous connectivity .",
    "rather , the pls analysis and the correlation analysis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cor_qm_h ] ) suggest that the network modularity plays a different role from the heterogeneous connectivity on the patient survivability .",
    "thus , this finding provides new and different insights into cancer robustness from the heterogeneous connectivity .",
    "in particular , modularity may facilitate an adaptation to changing environments @xcite .",
    "discrete modules in systems ( e.g. , networks ) may archive particular functions ; thus , systems are expected to acquire more modules when they have to robustly respond ( e.g. , cancer cells grow and survive ) under more various conditions .",
    "thus , a cancer with more modular signaling networks is more robust to multiple treatments such as the dosage of multiple drugs and radiation exposure .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with multidrug resistance in cancer @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies on the relationship between modularity and adaptation to changing environments , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , may be applicable to a deeper understanding of cancer behaviors and treatments .",
    "the network modularity improves the current understanding of cancer robustness obtained from the heterogeneous connectivity .",
    "although the heterogeneous connectivity suggests the existence of hub proteins such as p53 and its relationship with network robustness @xcite , recent studies encourage a reconsideration of the importance of hub proteins .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that hub proteins can be classified into 2 types despite a criticism to this dichotomy @xcite : party hubs that coordinate a specific functional component and date hubs that play a role of intermediates between different specific functional modules .",
    "in addition to this , they found that the effect of hub removals on cellular networks is different between party hubs and date hubs .",
    "in particular , the removal of date hubs leads to a more immediate collapse of cellular networks than that of party hubs .",
    "this findings implies the importance of hubs bridging between different network modules .",
    "such an importance is also suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore , a functional cartography method @xcite , revealing a patterns of intra- and inter - module connections in complex networks , and the concept of bottlenecks @xcite , key connectors with functional properties , are more useful for finding target proteins in cancer therapies .",
    "network modularity is also related to gene duplication .",
    "using generative models for complex networks , @xcite and @xcite showed that networks can acquire modular organization through gene duplication events .",
    "the similar conclusion is derived from the duplication - divergence model @xcite and the dorogovtsev - mendes - samukhin model @xcite .",
    "this result is important for a deeper understanding of the relationship between the modularity and the adaptation to changing environments . in particular ,",
    "the extent of gene duplication is correlated with habitat variability @xcite , which is related to the capability of quickly adapting to changing environments .",
    "gene duplications are believed to increase mutational robustness because they lead to functional redundancy in biological systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , several studies suggests that biological components ( e.g. , proteins ) belonging to the same module in cellular networks have similar or related functions ( e.g. , reviewed by @xcite ) .",
    "that is , gene duplications are microscopic mechanisms for biological robustness .",
    "they may lead to modularity at a higher level of organization ( i.e. , cellular network level ) , and may finally establish an adaptation to changing environments at a phenotypic level .",
    "this speculation suggests the impact of gene duplications on cancer robustness ; thus , such an impact may remain to be investigated using available databases such as the duplicated genes database @xcite .",
    "gene duplications facilitate the heterogeneous connectivity ( or scale - freeness ) in gene regulatory networks @xcite and protein networks @xcite because they result preferential attachments ( ` rich - gets - richer ' mechanisms ) because nodes with many neighbors tend to obtain more neighbors when considering such mechanisms .",
    "thus , gene duplications lead to both the heterogeneous connectivity and network modularity .",
    "according to these theories , however , functional divergences resulting edge additions , removals , rewiring , also influence the heterogeneous connectivity .",
    "thus , it is not necessarily that the heterogeneous connectivity is associated with the network modularity .",
    "in fact , such a relationship was not observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cor_qm_h ] )    although many studies support the modularity  robustness hypothesis , there are some criticisms to this hypothesis .",
    "for example , @xcite qualitatively showed that cellular networks can spontaneously acquire modular organization through evolutionary events such as duplication and divergence using a growing network model .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the evolution of modularity does not depend on changing environments , but it is related to the selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes .",
    "furthermore , @xcite represented , quantitatively , that network modularity can arise from simple growth processes , without consideration of an adaptation to environmental changes .",
    "@xcite revealed that the network modularity is not a general principle for either strengthening or weakening robustness using a mass - action kinetic model .",
    "some data analytic studies also support limited effect of network modularity on capability of quickly adapting to changing environments .",
    "for example , @xcite found that growth conditions , trophic requirement , and optimal growth temperature affect network modularity rather than environmental variability .",
    "@xcite also derived the similar conclusion using a larger dataset .",
    "furthermore , @xcite pointed out that the previously observed increase in network modularity due to habitat variability was probably due to a lack of available data on cellular networks .",
    "although the limited effect of network modularity is still debatable because it was concluded in biological networks other than molecular signaling networks ( metabolic networks in most cases ) , it may be a fact that the explanation of cancer patient survivability using the modularity  robustness hypothesis has limitations .",
    "when a greater variety of cancer signaling networks will be available in the future , we may observe exceptions in which the patient survivability can not be explained using molecular signaling networks in the context of network modularity .",
    "the definition of network modularity is also controvertible .",
    "the conclusion in this study is limited in the context of network modularity , which is only identified based on network topology .",
    "in particular , it is pointed out that the definition of modularity might not be topologically intuitive because of the locality and limited resolution @xcite although we avoided such limitations as much as possible using a module detection algorithm based on simulated annealing .",
    "alternative quantitative functions for community partition ( e.g. , the modularity density @xmath68 @xcite ) and methods based on link communities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which a @xmath68-based quantitative function , are used may be useful to avoid these limitations because they show a better prediction of biologically functional modules or categories . in this study , however , we did not consider these approaches because the quantitative functions ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) is not suitable for comparing network modularity with networks of different size and connectivity ( i.e. , the normalization method is not established ) .",
    "in addition to this , our analysis has more general limitations , as do many other works on network analyses : limited knowledge of biomolecular interactions ( i.e. , missing links ) and direction of cellular interaction such as signaling flows .",
    "although data analysis has several limitations , these findings provide new insights into the relationship between cellular networks ( a microscopic view ) and phenotypes ( a macroscopic view ) in cancer , and they enhance our understanding of adaptive and evolutionary mechanisms of cancer cells .",
