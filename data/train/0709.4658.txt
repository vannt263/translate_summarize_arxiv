    "some time ago , monte carlo calculations@xcite indicated that there appeared to be a region of quasi - long - range order ( qlro ) in the phase diagram of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) random - field @xmath0 model ( rfxym ) , at weak random field and low temperature .",
    "some recent functional renormalization group calculations@xcite have questioned this .",
    "therefore , since there have been substantial improvements in computing power over the last ten years , the author felt it worthwhile to conduct a new monte carlo study of this model .    for fixed - length classical spins",
    "the hamiltonian of the rfxym is @xmath6 each @xmath7 is a dynamical variable which takes on values between 0 and @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 indicates here a sum over nearest neighbors on a simple cubic lattice of size @xmath10 .",
    "we choose each @xmath11 to be an independent identically distributed quenched random variable , with the probability distribution @xmath12 for @xmath13 between 0 and @xmath8 .",
    "this hamiltonian is closely related to models of vortex lattices and charge density waves .",
    "larkin@xcite studied a model for a vortex lattice in a superconductor .",
    "his model replaces the spin - exchange term of the hamiltonian with a harmonic potential , so that each @xmath7 is no longer restricted to lie in a compact interval .",
    "he argued that for any non - zero value of @xmath2 this model has no ferromagnetic phase on a lattice whose dimension @xmath14 is less than or equal to four .",
    "a more intuitive derivation of this result was given by imry and ma,@xcite who assumed that the increase in the energy of an @xmath15 lattice when the order parameter is twisted at a boundary scales as @xmath16 .",
    "as argued by imry and ma,@xcite and later justified more carefully,@xcite within a perturbative @xmath17 expansion one finds the phenomenon of  dimensional reduction \" .",
    "the critical exponents of any @xmath14-dimensional @xmath18 random - field model ( where @xmath19 is the number of components of the spin on each site ) appear to be identical to those of an ordinary @xmath18 model of dimension @xmath20 . for the ising ( @xmath21 )",
    "case , this was shown rigorously to be incorrect.@xcite    because translation invariance is broken for any non - zero @xmath2 , it seems quite implausible that the twist energy for eqn .",
    "( 1 ) scales as @xmath16 , even though this is correct to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "an alternative derivation by aizenman and wehr,@xcite which claims to be mathematically rigorous , also makes an assumption equivalent to translation invariance .",
    "although the average over the probability distribution of random fields restores translation invariance , one must take the infinite volume limit first .",
    "it is not correct to interchange the infinite volume limit with the average over random fields .",
    "the basic point is that the imry - ma argument for continuous spins ( @xmath22 with @xmath23 ) is not self - consistent .",
    "one begins by assuming that the random field is weak so that the twist energy scales as @xmath16 , as in the absence of the random field .",
    "then one shows that if @xmath24 , this can not be true for large enough @xmath25 .",
    "the only conclusion which should be drawn from this is that a deeper analysis of what is going on is needed in that case .",
    "a mechanism which causes the breakdown of perturbation theory in the presence of quenched randomness at the critical temperature , @xmath26 , of the pure ferromagnet was discovered by griffiths@xcite in the special case of a bond - diluted ising model .",
    "it was later shown explicitly@xcite that the magnetization per unit volume , @xmath27 has an essential singularity at @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is a uniform field ) at and below @xmath26 .",
    "the result was then extended to the case of binary ferromagnetic alloys.@xcite it was later argued that this result could be extended beyond the ising model to @xmath22 models,@xcite and that the griffiths singularity will exist whenever the specific heat is divergent at @xmath26 for the pure model , so that the bond randomness is a relevant perturbation.@xcite    this argument appears to imply that it is never correct to use a perturbation theory of the standard type ( _ e.g. _ an @xmath17 expansion ) when the randomness is a relevant perturbation . on the other hand ,",
    "an @xmath17 expansion is only an asymptotic series even in the nonrandom case .",
    "thus one may hope that it might continue to be useful even in the presence of the griffiths singularity .",
    "the original concept of griffiths@xcite was a singularity caused by the contributions of large , isolated clusters of spins .",
    "hertz , fleishman and anderson@xcite developed a more intuitive picture of the griffiths singularity in random bond models , which was developed further by bray and moore@xcite .",
    "these authors showed that the same type of singular behavior would be a consequence of a lifshits tail of localized eigenvectors of the inverse magnetic susceptibility matrix , @xmath30 , near the band edge at eigenvalue zero .",
    "if one generalizes the idea of the griffiths singularity from these random bond models to random fields models , one finds similarities , but also important differences .",
    "the magnetic structure factor , @xmath31 , for @xmath0 spins is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the vector on the lattice which starts at site @xmath34 and ends at site @xmath35 , and here the angle brackets denote a thermal average . for a random field model , unlike a random bond model , the longitudinal part of the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath36 , which is given by @xmath37 is not the same as @xmath38 even above @xmath26 . for @xmath0 spins",
    ", @xmath39 and @xmath40 when there is a ferromagnetic phase transition , @xmath41 has a stronger divergence than @xmath42 .",
    "thus it is @xmath38 , and not @xmath36 , which is the best place to look for an essential singularity in the random field model .",
    "there may also be an effect@xcite in @xmath36 , but we should look in the place where the effect is expected to be largest .",
    "the author is not aware of any explicit studies on the question of the occurrence of lifshits tails in a matrix which has the form of @xmath43 .",
    "the natural generalization of the harris criterion is that the griffiths singularity should be found in @xmath44 at the @xmath26 of the pure @xmath22 ferromagnet for any finite @xmath19 , and any @xmath45 .",
    "this is because the response of the pure system to a weak uniform @xmath46 field is always divergent at @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ the susceptibility exponent @xmath47 is always positive.@xcite    a detailed numerical study of the 3d ising model in a random field ( rfim ) at @xmath48 has been performed by middleton and fisher.@xcite these authors find that the 3d rfim has a ferromagnetic critical point , and that the order parameter exponent @xmath49 has a small , but positive value .",
    "for weak random fields , the 3d rfim still has two low - temperature ( ferromagnetic ) gibbs states , even though the random fields have destroyed the kramers degeneracy .",
    "the current author believes the existence of multiple ferromagnetic gibbs states is required for the existence of a critical point with a positive @xmath49 .",
    "middleton and fisher find no explicit evidence for the existence of a griffiths phase in the rfim , although they agree that such a phase should exist .",
    "middleton@xcite has also studied the 4d rfim at @xmath48 .",
    "the scalar quantity @xmath50 is a well - defined function of the lattice size @xmath25 for finite lattices , which , with high probability , approaches its large @xmath25 limit smoothly as @xmath25 increases .",
    "the vector @xmath51 , on the other hand , is not really a well - behaved function of @xmath25 for an @xmath0 model in a random field .",
    "knowing the local direction in which @xmath51 is pointing , averaged over some small part of the lattice , may not give us a strong constraint on what @xmath52 for the entire lattice will be .",
    "in this work , we will present results for the average over angles of @xmath43 , which we write as @xmath3 .",
    "the data were obtained from @xmath1 simple cubic lattices with @xmath53 using periodic boundary conditions . some preliminary studies for smaller values of @xmath25",
    "were also done .",
    "the calculations were done using a 12-state clock model , _",
    "i.e. _ a @xmath54 approximation@xcite to the @xmath0 model of eqn .",
    ". the strengths of the random field for which data were obtained are @xmath2 = 1 and 2 .",
    "these sets of parameters allow the use of a lookup table for the boltzmann factors , because all the energies in the problem are expressible as sums of integers and integer multiples of @xmath55.@xcite    this discretization of the phase space of the model has significant effects at very low @xmath56 , but the effects at the temperatures we study here are expected to be negligible compared to our statistical errors .",
    "the probability distributions for the local magnetization of equilibrium states which are calculated for the @xmath54 model are found to have very small contributions from the third and higher harmonics of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is strong evidence that the 12-state clock model is an accurate approximation to the @xmath0 model within our range of parameters .",
    "the program uses two linear congruential pseudorandom number generators , one for choosing the values of the @xmath13 , and a different one for the monte carlo spin flips , which are performed by a single - spin - flip heat - bath algorithm .",

    "the error bars indicate one standard deviation statistical errors , and the @xmath62-axis is scaled logarithmically.,width=326 ]    four different @xmath4 realizations of the random fields @xmath13 were used .",
    "the same four samples of random fields were used for all values of @xmath56 , and both values of @xmath2 .",
    "each lattice was started off in a random spin state at @xmath63 , significantly above the @xmath26 for the pure model , and cooled slowly .",
    "thermal averages for @xmath43 were obtained at a set of temperatures . at each @xmath56",
    "a sequence of 12 spin states obtained at intervals of 20,480 monte carlo steps per spin ( mcs ) was fourier transformed and averaged .",
    "the data were then binned according to the value of @xmath64 , to give the angle - averaged @xmath3 . finally , a logarithically weighted average over the four samples was performed .",
    "the data for @xmath61 at @xmath65 between 1.3125 and 2.0 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "at @xmath66 , @xmath38 is clearly flattening out for @xmath67 .",
    "as @xmath56 is lowered , weight is shifted from large values of @xmath68 toward @xmath69 .",
    "for all the smaller values of @xmath65 shown in the figure , the correlation length , @xmath70 , is clearly larger than the size of the samples , @xmath4 .",
    "all of these large @xmath70 samples show an @xmath71 behavior at small @xmath68 , and the coefficient @xmath72 is , within our statistical errors , independent of @xmath56 .",
    "this apparently universal behavior is consistent with the prediction of giamarchi and le doussal@xcite for the 3d elastic glass model . for the elastic glass model , this @xmath71 behavior",
    "has be verified numerically by mcnamara , middleton and zeng.@xcite for the rfxym , however , we know that this behavior can not hold down to @xmath73 , because the fixed length of the @xmath0 spins yields a sum rule for @xmath38 : @xmath74    ( color online ) angle - averaged structure factor for @xmath60 lattices with @xmath75 at various temperatures .",
    "the error bars indicate one standard deviation statistical errors , and the @xmath62-axis is scaled logarithmically.,width=326 ]    there is also some interesting information to be learned from the dynamical behavior . below @xmath76 ,",
    "one of the four samples shows strong hysteresis , and a second one shows mild hysteresis .",
    "this may indicate the existence of a first - order phase transition for @xmath61 at @xmath77 .",
    "the hysteresis goes away as we continue to still lower @xmath56 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 under these conditions is clearly bigger than @xmath4 , however .",
    "therefore we can not say exactly what is going on here from these data .",

    "the error bars indicate one standard deviation statistical errors , and the @xmath62-axis is scaled logarithmically.,width=326 ]    due to the sum rule , eqn .",
    "( 7 ) , we know that the @xmath71 behavior which is seen in fig",
    ".  1 _ can not _ be the correct behavior at small @xmath68 for very large lattices . increasing the size of our lattice by a significant amount is rather impractical .",
    "however , it is impossible to distinguish between a ferromagnetic state and the qlro state claimed in the earlier monte carlo studies@xcite without studying the true small @xmath68 limit .    another way to learn more about",
    "the behavior is to decrease @xmath70 by increasing @xmath2 . in fig .  2 , we display @xmath3 data from four @xmath75 samples , obtained using the same procedures as before . in this case",
    "the peak at @xmath79 continues to grow as we lower @xmath56 , but there does not appear to be any simple scaling behavior .",
    "the peaks are very flat near @xmath79 .",
    "an attempt to fit the data by a lorentzian shape , or even a lorentzian raised to some power , is not satisfactory .    at @xmath80 ,",
    "a system which is started in an initially ordered state shows no sign of relaxing into the low @xmath5 state which is found by slow cooling , even on time scales of @xmath81 mcs per spin . in fig .",
    "3 we show @xmath82 , with @xmath75 , at this temperature , averaged over the same 4 samples for both types of initial conditions . from this figure",
    "we see that , although the two initial conditions give significantly different values of @xmath50 the rest of @xmath83 is almost the same .",
    "the peak in @xmath84 has continued to sharpen slowly with the reduction in @xmath56 .",
    "the values of @xmath85 , not shown in fig .  3 ,",
    "are @xmath86 for the initially ordered state , and @xmath87 for the slow - cooled state .",
    "the ordered initial conditions give slightly lower values of the energy per spin , as we will discuss in more detail in the next section . a careful study to find the highest value of @xmath56 for which the metastability exists was not performed . for @xmath75 , unlike @xmath61 , the relaxation time gets increasingly longer as we continue to lower @xmath56 beyond the point where metastability first appears .",
    "if , as argued by imry and ma , the random - field energy dominates the spin - exchange energy for the 3d rfxym , how could it be possible to have a ferromagnetic phase ? to understand this , we need to think carefully about finite - size scaling .",
    "consider a very large system at @xmath48 , with @xmath61 ( for example ) . since there is no degeneracy due to symmetry , and the energy is not quantized",
    ", we expect that the ground state for any particular sample of random fields should be unique , with probability one .",
    "if @xmath88 , then we expect that @xmath89 has a @xmath90-function peak at @xmath79 , of strength @xmath91 .",
    "if we consider some low , but finite @xmath56 , we expect that , in thermodynamic equilibrium , many states will contribute to @xmath89 .",
    "these states should have similar values of @xmath92 , but the direction of @xmath51 ought to be randomly distributed on the unit circle , so that @xmath93 .    in @xmath94 , the monte carlo results presented here do not indicate that there are many states with similar values of @xmath92 , but very different values of the direction of @xmath51 , contributing substantially to the equilibrium gibbs state .",
    "this may happen as a rare event in a few samples , but it is unlikely to be observed .",
    "there is , however , an alternative road to ferromagnetism .",
    "let us consider some very large , but finite , 3d sample .",
    "as bray has argued,@xcite @xmath30 has a lifshits tail of localized states near eigenvalue 0 .",
    "these localized states occur in regions of the sample in which the average local random field has a large magnitude , but a random direction . at any temperature",
    ", each such localized state corresponds to a compact cluster of spins which is pinned to point in a direction which is approximately parallel to the local field in that neighborhood .",
    "when we lower @xmath56 , the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath30 will be modified , as discussed by hertz , fleishman and anderson.@xcite for @xmath88 mobility edge will move down to zero , and the sample polarizes into the renormalized band - edge state . in 3d",
    "this type of continuous process can not occur .",
    "however , it may become possible , at a low enough @xmath56 , for the state of minimum eigenvalue to polarize most of the sample , without completely destroying the other stable clusters .",
    "a condition which makes it favorable for this process to occur is that the density of localized states should be low , and that the size of a typical localized state should be small compared to the average nearest neighbor distance between the localized states . whether this is possible",
    "may thus depend on the details of the distribution of random fields .",
    "an earlier calculation@xcite using a different type of random field distribution provided evidence for a continuous phase transition .    a small difference in energy per spin , @xmath95 per spin ,",
    "was found in our @xmath4 results for @xmath75 at @xmath96 between the slowly cooled states and the states relaxed from ordered initial conditions . in order to reach this low energy state ,",
    "the direction of the initial @xmath97 must be close to the direction of @xmath98 for the slow - cooled state .",
    "using an initial @xmath97 which is not close to this direction results in a state which has a higher energy than the slow - cooled state .",
    "the author believes that this energy is subextensive .",
    "this means that , as @xmath99 , @xmath100 , but @xmath101 . in these terms , the energy difference quoted above is @xmath102 .",
    "thus the boltzmann factor , @xmath103 , for the weighting of the two separate free energy minima is extremely small .",
    "since , of course , the free energies of the two gibbs states must be equal at the phase transition , this boltzmann factor must be compensated by the entropy difference between them .",
    "it has been known for a long time that something similar occurs@xcite in the 1d ising model with inverse - square law long - range interactions . for this model",
    "it is known that the correlation length diverges at @xmath26,@xcite so that @xmath26 is a critical point with @xmath104 . a phase transition of this type is also believed to occur in the _",
    "k_-core percolation model,@xcite which has been suggested as model for the ordinary glass transition .",
    "a rather similar subextensive singularity was recently seen in a type of 2d ising spin glass.@xcite if this effect also occurs in the ising spin glass in higher dimensions , where @xmath105 , it provides an explanation for the puzzling behavior of the high temperature series for the ising spin glass,@xcite since we know that for random bond ising models the griffiths singularity appears in 4d .",
    "this is consistent with the ideas of bray and moore.@xcite    a phase transition at about @xmath77 for @xmath61 and @xmath106 for @xmath75 is in good agreement with the work of gingras and huse,@xcite who worked at @xmath107 , and estimated the transition to be at @xmath108 .",
    "in this work we have performed monte carlo studies of the 3d rfxym on @xmath4 simple cubic lattices , with random field strengths of @xmath2 = 1 and 2 .",
    "we present results for the structure factor , @xmath3 , at a sequence of temperatures .",
    "we argue that our results appear to indicate a phase transition into a ferromagnetic state .",
    "this is made possible by the existence of a griffiths singularity , which invalidates the imry - ma analysis . at the phase transition @xmath5",
    "seems to jump to zero discontinuously , but with a latent heat per spin which probably goes to zero as @xmath99 .",
