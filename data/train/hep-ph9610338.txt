    "<S> we discuss below a method for evaluating @xmath27 exactly .    </S>",
    "<S> it was noted in @xcite that for @xmath38 , the soliton solution satisfies a constraint that becomes independent of @xmath39 . to see this we note that all source terms enter with the same power of @xmath39 in ( [ source1]-[source4 ] ) , and eqs.([field1 ] ) and ( [ field2 ] ) are @xmath39-independent , so with the above notation this constraint takes the simple form @xmath40 thus a large amount of cancellation is required between these source terms for large @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this restricts the form of the solutions , but does not necessarily enforce an asymptotic @xmath39-independent shape , as claimed in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it can be seen that although the fourth order terms do not make a substantial contribution to the energy , this is not the case for the density ( which is shown for @xmath47 in the table ) . for the self - consistent solution </S>",
    "<S> the convergence is worse as @xmath39 increases and the size of the scalar bag solution shrinks .    </S>",
    "<S> our purpose therefore , is to reconsider this model and make use of the correction method described in @xcite to account for the fermionic vacuum in an exact manner . </S>",
    "<S> this involves extending a scheme discussed by wasson and koonin @xcite for calculations in one spatial dimension . in three spatial dimensions , an exact , or `` brute - force '' calculation involves making a partial wave expansion of the green function ( [ green ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 each partial wave green function obeys the equation @xmath49 which can be solved numerically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar partial wave expansion can be made of the de approximation to the green function , eq.([greende ] ) , giving @xmath50 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of all partial wave de contributions to the density will reproduce the expressions ( [ source3]-[source4 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> wasson and koonin @xcite pointed out that the de approximation to the green function works well for large loop energies @xmath2 ( and similarly also for large angular momenta @xmath51 in three spatial dimensions ) . </S>",

    "<S> the exact green function contribution can be calculated up to some @xmath52 , and the de can be used to calculate the contribution for the remaining partial waves . an equivalent method is to use the full de result , and correct the low energy and low partial wave terms using the difference between the exact and de expressions for @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> unfortunately , when the correction ( [ cor_d ] ) is included we can not simply use the colnew routine as written , since our equations are actually integro - differential equations . to facilitate this , </S>",
    "<S> colnew was modified so that the scalar field solution and its derivative can be extracted at intermediate stages of the calculation to evaluate the density correction . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is then internally iterative , with @xmath60 treated as a source term that is reevaluated as needed with each internal iteration of the colnew code .    </S>",
    "<S> we now examine the results when using different levels of approximation to the vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> we use the schemes discussed above in the following order : cl , lda , de , and ex . here </S>",
    "<S> ex will refer to the exact solution , which includes @xmath60 ( [ d_corr_cut ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to quantify the effect of this correction on the self - consistent solution for various couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the choice @xmath64 , @xmath65 will serve as an example . </S>",
    "<S> ( as the energy scale @xmath5 already includes an implicit dependence on @xmath39 , setting @xmath66 simply fixes the scalar field mass at the vev value . )    for the cl , lda , and de approximations the self - consistent solutions for @xmath20 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_bn1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we see that adding the lda term reduces the depth and width of the scalar field , so that a zero no longer appears . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of the solution , @xmath67 ( lda ) , has dramatically changed from that of the semi - classical approximation , @xmath68 ( cl ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior , which was identified by @xcite at the de level , occurs even before the derivative terms are included . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath69 the lda approximation gives no solution . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the expression for the lda contribution in ( [ source3 ] ) , we see that this function is odd with respect to the scalar field . increasing the coupling drives the scalar field deeper , so that near @xmath70 the solution becomes negative at @xmath47 , and the lda contributes with the opposite sign . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the equations no longer support a solution as it is impossible to satisfy the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the de terms are included the vacuum density is not forced to change sign as @xmath39 is increased , and a soliton solution exists . in fig.[fig_bn1 ] we see that the shape of the scalar field for @xmath64 is even shallower for the de than for the lda . an interesting feature </S>",
    "<S> to note is that under the de the total energy , @xmath71 ( de ) , is relatively unchanged from the lda result . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs even though the fermi level has changed from @xmath72 ( lda ) to @xmath73 ( de ) , and is made possible due to a corresponding decrease in the energy contribution from the scalar field , @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> now examine what happens when the density correction terms are included . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_g10_pw ] the self - consistent scalar field solutions are shown for calculations including an increasing number of partial wave corrections . the exact vacuum density favors a deeper scalar field than the de . </S>",
    "<S> the fifth partial wave has not been included in the figure since the field in this case is found to be indistinguishable from that with four partial waves . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the sequence of scalar fields in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_bn1 ] and [ fig_g10_pw ] we see a manifestation of the fact that terms in the derivative expansion display oscillatory convergence @xcite . note that after including the @xmath75 term in the correction ( [ cor_d ] ) the correct vacuum density is specified at the origin as higher terms are zero there . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath76 terms may still affect the self - consistent solution . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_g10_pw ] that the scalar field becomes deeper as subsequent terms in the correction are included . </S>",
    "<S> the corrected solution gives @xmath77 ( ex ) , and @xmath78 ( ex ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the scalar field is twice the de result , and the fermi level has dropped away from @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the total energy remains fairly stable , rising only slightly above the de result .    to get the ex correction it is sufficient to use partial waves up to @xmath79 , except at large @xmath39 where @xmath80 is needed . in fig.[fig_dvsg ] we see that for other values of @xmath39 there is also a decrease in the depth of the scalar field using the exact calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the exact results agree with the de calculation for small coupling as expected . as @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> is increased the depth of the bag decreases . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath81 values of the wave function @xmath82 near @xmath47 are numerically uncertain by about @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this uncertainty is a symptom of the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) , but in no way affects the value of the energies . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_erung ] we show how including the correction affects the energies at different @xmath39 . > from the fermion energy , @xmath32 , we see that the corrections affect the solution for all @xmath84 . as the coupling increases we have found that not only does the width of the bag shrink , but the depth increases . since this leads to larger derivatives , the energy of the scalar field increases . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , fermions may be more tightly bound in the bag so that the fermi energy level decreases . when the fermionic and scalar field energies are added to obtain the total energy , </S>",
    "<S> the sum gives an answer that is closer to the de result than either of the components separately . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs at all @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is surprising to find that the corrected total energy remains fairly constant as the coupling is increased , exhibiting nearly the same scaling as the de total energy . recall that our energy is scaled in terms of the fermionic mass @xmath85 , so that relative to @xmath86 the energy scales directly proportional to the coupling . </S>",
    "<S> thus the claim that such scaling behavior is universal @xcite is supported by our calculations .    in summary , we have found a way of correcting the de approximation for fermionic vacuum fluctuations while still demanding a self - consistent solution . </S>",
    "<S> there remain several ways in which the results of the calculation done here may be made more general . to include different fermionic energy levels it would likely be more economical to use the colnew routine to solve only the scalar equation , while solving the eigenvalue problem for the relevant fermionic wave function components using standard runge - kutta techniques . </S>",
    "<S> if one takes for granted some validity in the one loop approximation for finite @xmath3 and large coupling , it should also be possible to include the scalar fluctuations at the one loop level . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that these fluctuations would contribute a source density term with the opposite sign to the fermionic fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is likely that a similar density correction calculation would be necessary for the scalar loops to ascertain that this contribution to the true scalar vacuum was also included correctly .    </S>",
