    "the type - i  @xcite and type - iii  @xcite seesaw mechanisms offer a simple explanation for the existence of light standard model ( sm ) neutrinos . in these approaches",
    "the tree - level exchange of heavy intermediate fermions achieves neutrino masses with an inverse dependence on the heavy - fermion mass , @xmath3 , suppressing the masses relative to the weak scale . in the low - energy effective theory",
    "these masses are described by the non - renormalizable operator @xmath4 , which famously has mass - dimension @xmath5  @xcite .    there exist generalizations of the type - i and type - iii seesaws that can similarly explain the existence of light sm neutrinos .",
    "the basic point is that the type - i and type - iii seesaws can be described by a generic tree - level diagram with two external scalars and a heavy intermediate fermion ; see figure  [ fig : l_vertex_nu_tree_generic ] .",
    "the use of different intermediate fermions allows for variant tree - level seesaws , where either one or both of the external scalars is a beyond - sm field .",
    "naively it appears that many variant seesaws are possible .",
    "however , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the beyond - sm scalars are generally constrained by @xmath6-parameter measurements to satisfy @xmath7 .",
    "such small vevs can arise naturally if they are induced and therefore develop an inverse dependence on the scalar masses , i.e.  @xmath8 .",
    "demanding such an explanation for the small vevs greatly restricts the number of minimal realizations of figure  [ fig : l_vertex_nu_tree_generic ]  @xcite .",
    "because the vevs of the beyond - sm scalars are induced , these generalized seesaws generate low - energy effective operators with @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that there are only four such minimal models that give effective operators with @xmath9  @xcite ; namely the @xmath10 model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath1 models of refs .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , and the @xmath1 model proposed in ref .",
    "nature of the associated feynman diagrams , in section  [ sec : new_seesaw ] ; see table  [ table : seesaw_models ] and figure  [ fig : general_seesaw_diagrams ] respectively . ]",
    "the generalized seesaws turn out to be more complicated creatures than their type - i and type - iii cousins .",
    "extensions of the sm that permit the tree - level diagram of figure  [ fig : l_vertex_nu_tree_generic ] automatically admit the term @xmath11 in the scalar potential  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to close the seesaw diagram in figure  [ fig : l_vertex_nu_tree_generic ] to obtain the @xmath5 loop - diagram in figure  [ fig : loop ] .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , the generalized models are not purely seesaw models , nor are they purely radiative models , but instead they are something in between .",
    "both mechanisms are always present , with the tree - level mass being dominant in some regions of parameter space and the radiative mass being dominant in other regions . if one envisions the theory space for models with massive neutrinos , the generalized seesaws exist in the intersection of the set of models with seesaw masses and the set of models with radiative masses ( see figure  [ fig:2venn ] ) .",
    "put succinctly , these are seesaw / radiative models , and they are irreducible , in the sense that modifying the particle content to remove one effect necessarily removes them both .",
    "as we shall see , this is manifest in an identical flavor structure for the seesaw and radiative masses .",
    "these distinctions give an important difference relative to the type - i and type - iii approaches . in the seesaw / radiative models neutrino mass",
    "is generated either by a tree - level seesaw described by the operator @xmath12 with @xmath0 , or by a radiative diagram generating a @xmath5 operator with additional loop - suppression . in either case the new physics is constrained to be much lighter than that allowed by the type - i and type - iii seesaws ; e.g.  one can have @xmath13 which decreases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "collider experiments at the energy frontier will therefore explore the parameter space for these generalized models long before the full parameter space for the type - i and type - iii seesaws can be investigated .    in the present work ,",
    "we detail the nature of neutrino mass in the newly proposed model with @xmath1 , and study the collider phenomenology of the exotic fermions predicted by the model .",
    "these fermions form an isospin-3/2 representation of @xmath15 and contain a doubly - charged component .",
    "collider production of the exotics is controlled by electroweak interactions and depends only on the fermion mass .",
    "the decay properties of the fermions , and therefore the expected signals at colliders like the lhc , have some sensitivity to model details and , in particular , depend on the mixing with sm leptons .",
    "however , because the model predicts a basic relation amongst vevs ( @xmath16 ) , some decay branching fractions can be largely determined ; e.g.  the total leptonic branching fractions can be determined with essentially no dependence on the neutrino mass hierarchy . however , the relative branching fractions for decays to _ different _ charged leptons have remnant dependence on the properties of the neutrino sector .",
    "we shall see that the number of light charged - lepton events ( @xmath17 ) , relative to the number of tauon events , can encode information regarding the neutrino mass hierarchy and the mixing phases .",
    "a number of signals predicted by the model are reminiscent of those found in related seesaw models like the type - iii seesaw and the @xmath1 models  @xcite .",
    "the branching fractions for lepton - number violating like - sign dilepton events is comparable to that found in the type - iii seesaw  @xcite , though the details of the events are different . in our analysis",
    "we discuss differences between the models and indicate strategies for searching for the exotic fermions ; for example , the present model predicts lepton - number violating events like @xmath18 but not @xmath19 , which is opposite to that expected in the type - iii case  @xcite and the @xmath1 model of ref .",
    "such events , and others that we outline , lead to a host of multi - lepton final states .",
    "we shall see that the model also predicts a doubly - charged fermion that can be discovered at the 5@xmath2 level for masses approaching the tev scale in optimistic cases .    in our presentation",
    "we make efforts to follow the structure of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , which detail the collider phenomenology of related exotic fermions , to allow for easier comparison . as shall be evident during our analysis , there are aspects of our work that are relevant for the related models . in a partner paper",
    "we shall present a detailed comparative analysis of the exotic fermions appearing in the models with @xmath20 , including the triplets @xmath21 , which appear in the @xmath10 model  @xcite , model .",
    "a study of the bounds from flavor changing processes appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite , and they were studied in different contexts in ref .  @xcite . ] and the quintuplet fermions from the alternative @xmath1 models  @xcite .",
    "the partner paper further explores the doubly - charged exotic fermions which are present in all four models ; these provide a simple way to obtain generic experimental constraints for this class of models .",
    "many works have studied production mechanisms and detection prospects for the heavy neutrinos employed in the type - i seesaw  @xcite .",
    "both cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite have searched for the corresponding signals in the lhc data .",
    "similarly , the triplet fermions in the type - iii seesaw are well studied  @xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) contains an atlas ( cms ) search for these exotics .",
    "a comparative study of lhc signals from the @xmath5 seesaws has appeared  @xcite , and more general discussion of tev - scale exotics related to neutrino mass  @xcite , and right - handed neutrinos  @xcite , exists in the literature . for the collider phenomenology of the exotic scalars in the @xmath10 model see ref .",
    "@xcite ( also see  @xcite ) .",
    "note that perturbative unitarity gives general upper - bounds on the quantum numbers of larger multiplets  @xcite , and that the quadruplet fermions of interest in this work were previously considered as dark matter  @xcite , and in relation to radiative neutrino - mass  @xcite .",
    "alternative models of neutrino mass realizing low - energy effective operators with @xmath0 exist  @xcite , and an earlier work combined a seesaw model with a radiative model  @xcite ( also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also , it was recently shown that some versions of the inverse seesaw mechanism can generate neutrino mass via a combination of both tree - level and radiative masses , similar to the models discussed here  @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : new_seesaw ]",
    "we introduce the @xmath1 model and discuss the symmetry - breaking sector . section  [ sec : neutral_fermion_mass ] details the origin of neutrino mass and section  [ sec : applying_data ] investigates the extent to which the parameters can be fixed by neutrino oscillation data .",

    "detection signals are discussed in section  [ sec : signals ] and the work concludes in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the model of interest in this work and discuss aspects of its scalar sector . as noted already , there are only four minimal models of this type that produce low - energy effective operators with @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "we list the particle content for these models in table  [ table : seesaw_models ] .",
    "can also be implemented as an inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite . ]",
    "each model generates the tree - level diagram in figure  [ fig : l_vertex_nu_tree_generic ] and can thus achieve seesaw neutrino masses .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     given that the production cross section is larger in the present model , one expects the discovery reach for @xmath35 at the lhc to exceed the discovery reach for @xmath36 quoted in ref  @xcite for the entire region of parameter space with @xmath37 .",
    "this includes most of the parameter space for the case of an inverted hierarchy and a sizable fraction of the parameter space for a normal hierarchy , giving a @xmath38 discovery reach of at least @xmath39  ( 700 )  tev with @xmath40  fb@xmath41 of data at the 7  ( 14 )  tev lhc for @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "greater ( reduced ) reach is expected as one increases ( decreases ) this branching fraction and/or the integrated luminosity ; see figure  7 of ref  @xcite . for example , in the most optimistic case of an inverted hierarchy with @xmath43 the @xmath38 discovery reach will be at least @xmath44  tev with @xmath40  fb@xmath41 of data at the 14  tev lhc .",
    "these numbers are a rough guide but none the less suggest that good discovery reach can be achieved at the lhc .",
    "we hope to refine these numbers in a partner paper , where we shall present a detailed comparative analysis of the exotic fermions in all the seesaw / radiative models .",
    "note that each of the models @xmath45 through @xmath46 in table  [ table : seesaw_models ] contain a doubly - charged fermion .",
    "therefore an lhc search for exotic doubly - charged fermions via the process would give generic bounds applicable to all of the models ( or , optimistically , generate evidence for the origin of neutrino mass ) .",
    "such an analysis appears to be the simplest experimental search capable of probing all of the models , as we shall detail in the partner paper .",
    "the type - i and type - iii seesaw mechanisms are part of a larger , generalized set of tree - level seesaws that can achieve small neutrino mass via heavy fermion exchange  @xcite .",
    "the generalized seesaw mechanisms differ from their simpler counterparts in two main ways ; firstly , they realize mass via low - energy effective operators with mass - dimension @xmath0 , and , secondly , they allow radiative masses that can dominate the seesaw mass in regions of parameter space .",
    "the models are therefore something of a hybrid between the traditional seesaw mechanisms and the traditional radiative models of neutrino mass ; see figure  [ fig:2venn ] .",
    "there are only four minimal models of this type that give effective operators with @xmath20  @xcite . in this work we studied the remaining @xmath1 model , detailing the origin of neutrino mass and investigating the collider phenomenology of the exotic quadruplet fermions predicted in the model [ @xmath47 .",
    "collider production of these exotics proceeds via electroweak interactions with cross sections that are fixed , modulo their dependence on the fermion mass scale .",
    "the decay properties of the fermions encodes information about their connection to neutrino mass ; for example the branching ratio for @xmath48 is highly suppressed relative to @xmath49 due to the suppression of @xmath50 inherent in the model .",
    "furthermore the branching fractions for charged leptons of different families are sensitive to both the neutrino mass hierarchy and the mixing phases .",
    "lepton number violating like - sign dilepton events , which have no sm background , are a key feature of the model .",
    "as an example , with @xmath51  gev a production cross section for @xmath52 or @xmath53 pairs of @xmath54  fb is expected for the lhc operating at @xmath55  tev , giving @xmath56 same - sign dilepton events of the type @xmath57 , for @xmath58  fb@xmath41 of data .",
    "for a normal hierarchy the electron - fraction in these events is suppressed relative to the tauon and muon fractions ; for an inverted hierarchy the leptons can be predominantly electrons , allowing a simpler extraction of the signal .",
    "these and other similar events give a host of multi - lepton signals , much like those found in related models like the type - iii seesaw .",
    "our analysis suggests that the doubly - charged exotic @xmath35 could be discovered at the @xmath38 level for @xmath59  ( 700 )  gev with 100  fb@xmath41 of data at the 7 ( 14 )  tev lhc .",
    "this reach extends higher in more optimistic regions of parameter space .",
    "we briefly discussed ways to differentiate the distinct fermions in the various seesaw / radiative models , and noted that a dedicated lhc search for exotic doubly - charged fermions would provide generic bounds applicable to all of the models ( or discover evidence for the origin of neutrino mass ) . in a partner paper",
