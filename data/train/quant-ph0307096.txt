    "the successful manipulation of atom - field interactions in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and trapped ions is a great achievement of present - day physics which has encouraged outstanding theoretical proposals and experimental implementations . as high-@xmath0 cavities @xcite and ionic traps @xcite have permitted the preparation of coherent - state superpositions of the form @xmath1 @xmath2 , with mean numbers of photon and phonon quanta @xmath3 , mesoscopic quantum coherence has been investigated . in the cavity qed domain",
    ", the progressive decoherence of mesoscopic superpositions involving radiation fields with classically distinct phases was observed through atom - field interaction @xcite and the reversible decoherence of such a mesoscopic - field state has been conjectured @xcite .",
    "moreover , the generation and detection of fock - states of the radiation field was demonstrated experimentally @xcite and the rabi oscillation of circular rydberg atoms in the vacuum and in small coherent fields in a high-@xmath0 cavity was measured @xcite , revealing the quantum nature of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "parallel to the achievements in cavity qed , the mastery of techniques to manipulate electronic and motional states of trapped ions with classical fields has enabled the control of fundamental quantum phenomena at a level that seems to herald a new phase in technology .",
    "the operation of a two - bit controlled - not quantum logic gate was demonstrated by storing the two quantum bits in the internal and external degrees of freedom of a single trapped ion @xcite .",
    "a `` schrdinger cat '' superposition of spatially - separated coherent harmonic states was generated @xcite , as well as other nonclassical states at the single atom level @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of the density matrices and the wigner functions of various quantum states of motion of a harmonically bound ion was also reported @xcite .    besides the atom - field interaction in cavity qed and trapped ions , the preparation of _ reference _ travelling - field states needed to measure the properties of _ signal _ travelling fields @xcite has been suggested based on optical linear @xcite and nonlinear devices @xcite . the techniques developed over the last decades for the process of parametric up- and down - conversion have enabled great advances in the domain of travelling waves .",
    "the production of true entanglement by type - ii noncollinear phase - matching in parametric down - conversion was employed to demonstrate a violation of bell s inequality with two - photon fringe visibilities in excess of 97% @xcite .",
    "three - photon greenberger - horne - zeilinger entanglement has also been observed @xcite and it is worth stressing that the experimental implementations of teleportation have been achieved with travelling wave techniques @xcite , as these provide the facilities for preparation of the state to be teleported , for the quantum channel and for the accomplishment of the required bell - type measurements .",
    "high - fidelity teleportation of superpositions @xcite and entanglements of running - wave field states @xcite have also been presented .",
    "as the techniques for generating nonclassical superposition states have been improved , the attention turns to a major problem that must be overcome in the contexts of quantum communication @xcite and computation @xcite : the decoherence of quantum states due to the inevitable coupling of the quantum systems to their environment @xcite and even due to fluctuation in the interaction parameters required to prepare a coherent superposition @xcite .",
    "schemes for inhibiting decoherence by engineering the reservoir have been developed for trapped ions @xcite and atomic two - level systems @xcite .",
    "measurements of the decoherence of superposed motional states of a trapped ion coupled to an engineered reservoir , where the coupling and the state of the environment are controllable @xcite , have also been reported .",
    "the possibility of controlling the decoherence mechanism is crucial to the preparation of the long - lived macroscopic superposition states and entanglements of macroscopic objects required for the implementation of the potential applications of quantum mechanics in communication and computation @xcite . beyond the efforts being made to engineer mesoscopic superpositions and entanglements with photon and phonon quanta , referred to above",
    ", the possibility of engineering such mesoscopic states with massive objects has been and is being pursued .",
    "recently , correlations ( on average ) of collective spin states of two macroscopic objects , each consisting of a caesium gas sample with about @xmath4 atoms , was demonstrated experimentally . in ref .",
    "@xcite an experimental scenario designed to reduce dramatically the decoherence rate of a quantum superposition of bose - einstein condensates is outlined .",
    "this is also our concern in the present work , focusing on the preparation of long - lived states of the radiation field in cavity qed .",
    "methods for manipulating cavity - field states through atoms driven by external fields @xcite constitute an important means of attaining arbitrary control of a quantum field .",
    "although the time evolution of a field state under linear and parametric amplifications has been a major concern in quantum optics for generating squeezed states and investigating their properties @xcite , of classical driving fields have barely been considered for quantum states engineering purposes . here",
    "we present a proposal for achieving long - lived mesoscopic superposition states of the radiation field in cavity qed which relies on two basic requirements : parametric amplification and an engineered squeezed - vacuum reservoir for cavity - field states ( we note that the required engineered reservoir - resulting from the standard vacuum for cavity modes plus additional interactions - must be an optimum squeezed - vacuum reservoir ) .",
    "in addition , our technique can be employed to prepare number states with fidelities higher than those generated as circular states @xcite .",
    "our proposal considers the dispersive interaction of a two - level atom with a cavity field which is simultaneously under amplification processes .",
    "the parametric amplification is employed to achieve a high degree of squeezing and excitation of what we actually want to be a mesoscopic superposition state .",
    "we show that the prepared squeezed - mesoscopic state , under the action of a similarly squeezed reservoir , exhibits a decoherence time orders of magnitude longer than those of non - squeezed cavity - field states subjected to the influence of @xmath5 a squeezed reservoir and @xmath6 a non - squeezed reservoir .",
    "in fact , the computed decoherence time turns out to be independent of both the average photon number and the distance in phase space between the centers of the quasi - probability distribution of the individual states composing the prepared superposition .",
    "the decoherence time depends only on the excitation of the initial coherent state injected into the cavity previous to the preparation of the squeezed superposition .",
    "this remarkable result follows when the direction of squeezing of the superposition state is perpendicular to that of the reservoir modes . under this condition ,",
    "the entanglement between the prepared state and the modes of the reservoir is minimized and so the noise injected from the reservoir into the prepared cavity mode is minimal , making it a long - lived superposition state .",
    "we finally stress that a scheme has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the implementation of the parametric amplification of an arbitrary radiation - field state previously prepared in a high-@xmath0 cavity . as squeezed light",
    "is mainly supplied by nonlinear optical media as running waves ( through backward @xcite or forward @xcite four - wave mixing and parametric down - conversion @xcite ) , standing squeezed fields in high-@xmath0 cavities or ion traps can be generated through atom - field interaction @xcite .",
    "although considerable space has been devoted in the literature to the squeezing process in the jaynes - cumming model , the issue of squeezing any desired prepared cavity - field state @xmath7 , i.e. , the accomplishment of the operation @xmath8 in cavity qed ( @xmath9 standing for a set of group parameters ) has not been addressed .",
    "engineering such an operation was the subject of ref .",
    "@xcite ; it is achieved through the dispersive interactions of a three - level atom simultaneously with a classical driving field and a cavity mode whose prepared state we wish to squeeze . in short",
    ", the dispersive interaction of the cavity mode with a driven atom produces the desired operation @xmath10 . since linear amplification",
    "is easily accomplished in cavity qed @xcite , the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite contributes crucially for the experimental feasibility of the present proposal for preparation and control of long - lived cavity - field state through atom - driving field interaction .",
    "the proposed configuration for engineering driven - cavity - field states , depicted in fig .",
    "1 , consists of a two - level rydberg atom @xmath11 which crosses a ramsey - type arrangement , i.e. , a high-@xmath0 micromaser cavity @xmath12 located between two ramsey zones @xmath13 and @xmath14 . after interacting with this arrangement ,",
    "the atom is counted by detection chambers @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( for ionizing the excited @xmath17 and ground @xmath18 states , respectively ) , projecting the cavity - field in the desired state .",
    "the transition of the two - level atom @xmath11 from excited to ground state is far from resonant with the cavity mode frequency , allowing a dispersive atom - field interaction to occur .",
    "in addition to the dispersive interaction with the two - level atom , the cavity mode is simultaneously submitted to linear and parametric amplifications ( both represented in fig . 1 by the source @xmath19 ) so that the hamiltonian of our model ( for @xmath20 ) is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the creation and annihilation operators for the cavity mode of frequency @xmath25 which lies between the two atomic energy levels , which are separated by @xmath26 , such that the detuning @xmath27 is large enough to enable only virtual transitions to occur between the states @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the atom - field coupling parameter inside the cavity is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the rabi frequency .",
    "the expression for the atom - field dispersive interaction on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is valid under the assumption that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a characteristic photon number and @xmath34 is the spontaneous - emission rate @xcite .",
    "we suppose , for simplicity , that the atom - field coupling is turned on ( off ) suddenly at the instant the atom enters ( leaves ) the cavity region * * , * * such that @xmath35 when the atom is outside the cavity .",
    "we consider the atom , prepared at time @xmath36 by the ramsey zone @xmath13 in a @xmath37,@xmath17 superposition , to reach @xmath12 at time @xmath38 and leave it at @xmath39 .",
    "the linear and parametric pumping are assumed to be turned on also at @xmath36 and turned off at a convenient time @xmath40 .",
    "finally , the action of the classical amplification mechanism on the cavity mode is described by the hamiltonian @xmath41 where the time - dependent ( td ) functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 allow the parametric and linear amplifications , respectively .",
    "it is well understood that for specific values of these td functions the eigenstates of the schrdinger equation may squeeze the variance in one of the cavity modes two quadrature phases @xcite .    the schrdinger state vector associated with hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "can be written using @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the complex quantity @xmath47 standing for the eigenvalues of @xmath24 , and @xmath48 are the expansion coefficients for @xmath49 in the coherent - state basis , @xmath50 . using the orthogonality of the atomic states and eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) we obtain the uncoupled td schrdinger equations : @xmath51 with @xmath52   $ ] .",
    "note that the problem has been reduced to that of a cavity field , under parametric and linear pumping , whose frequency @xmath25 is shifted by @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) when interacting with the atomic state @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , during the time interval @xmath57 .",

    "however , the operator @xmath64 , which gives the evolution of the cavity - field state during its interaction with the atom , does depend on the atomic state and differs from the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 only by the shifted frequency @xmath67 .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) has been investigated in the search for squeezed states of the radiation field .",

    "we make use of the td invariants of lewis and riesenfeld @xcite to solve the schrdinger equation ( [ eq3 ] ) , following the reasoning in ref .",
    "@xcite : instead of proposing an invariant associated with the hamiltonian ( [ eq4 ] ) , we first perform a unitary transformation on eq .",

    "<S> the role of the amplification - controlling fields in the achievement of real mesoscopic states , is to produce highly - squeezed field states and , consequently , to increase both : i ) the distance in phase space between the components of the prepared superpositions and ii ) the mean photon number of such superpositions . </S>",
