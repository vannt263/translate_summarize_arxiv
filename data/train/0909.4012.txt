    "when very high energy cosmic rays interact in the stratosphere , mesons are produced in the primary hadronic interaction .",
    "these mesons either interact and produce lower energy hadronic cascades , or decay into high energy muons which can be observed deep underground . while the temperature of the troposphere varies considerably within the day , the temperature of the stratosphere remains nearly constant , usually changing on the timescale of seasons ( with the exception of the occasional sudden stratospheric warming  @xcite ) .",
    "an increase in temperature of the stratosphere causes a decrease in density .",
    "this reduces the chance of meson interaction , resulting in a larger fraction decaying to produce muons .",
    "this results in a higher muon rate observed deep underground  @xcite .",
    "the majority of muons detected in the minos far detector are produced in the decay of pions , although the decays of kaons must be considered for a more complete description of the flux  @xcite .",
    "minos is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment  @xcite , with a neutrino source and near detector at fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia , il , usa , and a far detector at the soudan underground mine state park in northern minnesota , usa .",
    "this paper describes cosmic ray data taken in the far detector , a scintillator and steel tracking calorimeter located underground ( , meters water equivalent )  @xcite .",
    "it has a mass and a @xmath6 { cm^2 sr}$ ]  @xcite acceptance .",
    "because of its depth , minos detects cosmic - ray muons with energy at the surface , .",
    "these high energy muons are mostly the result of the decays of the mesons produced in the primary hadronic interaction .",
    "this , coupled with the large acceptance , makes it possible to detect small seasonal temperature fluctuations in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the far detector is the deepest underground detector with a magnetic field , allowing the separation of particles by charge .",
    "the minos data are correlated with atmospheric temperature measurements at the soudan site provided by the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf )  @xcite .",
    "this temperature data set has higher precision than any other used for the seasonal variation analysis  @xcite .",
    "the 67.32 million muon events used in this analysis were collected over five years , from august  1 ,  2003 to july  31 ,  2008 , a period that includes five complete annual cycles .",
    "the seasonal variations in muon intensity were compared to a theoretical model which extends the pion - only model of  @xcite to include the contribution from kaons .",
    "the underground muon intensity depends on the threshold energy @xmath7 and the cosine of the zenith angle @xmath8 . the change in underground muon intensity variations as a function of temperature",
    "was derived following the formalism of  @xcite .",
    "the change in the surface muon intensity , @xmath9 occurring at the minos far detector site can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the change in atmospheric temperature at atmospheric depth @xmath12 , and the weight @xmath13 reflects the temperature dependence of the production of mesons in the atmosphere and their decay into muons that can be observed in the far detector .",
    "a temperature coefficient @xmath14 can be defined as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the muon intensity evaluated at a given value of atmospheric temperature @xmath17 .",
    "the phenomenological relationship between the atmospheric temperature fluctuations and muon intensity variations can now be written as:@xmath18    the atmosphere consists of many levels that vary continuously in both temperature and pressure . to simplify calculations ,",
    "the atmosphere is approximated by an isothermal body with an effective temperature , @xmath19 , obtained from a weighted average over the atmospheric depth : @xmath20 an `` effective temperature coefficient '' , @xmath21 can then be defined @xmath22 with these definitions in place , the relationship between atmospheric temperature fluctuations and muon intensity variations can now be written as : @xmath23 the configuration and geometric acceptance of the far detector remain constant over time . therefore",
    ", the rate , @xmath24 of muons observed in the detector is proportional to the incident muon intensity and varies with the effective atmospheric temperature as follows : @xmath25 in practice , the observed muon rates and the temperature data are averaged over the period of a day .",
    "the effective temperature is obtained from a weighted average of temperature measurements obtained at a set of discrete pressure levels .",
    "the weight @xmath13 can be written as the sum @xmath26 , representing the contribution of pions and kaons to the overall variation in muon intensity .",
    "the weights @xmath27 are given by  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29    the parameters @xmath30 include the amount of inclusive meson production in the forward fragmentation region , masses of mesons and muons , and muon spectral index ; the input values are @xmath31  =  1 and @xmath32  =  @xmath33  @xcite , where @xmath34 is the k/@xmath3 ratio .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 reflect the relative atmospheric attenuation of mesons ; the threshold energy , @xmath7 , is the energy required for a muon to survive to a particular depth ; the attenuation lengths for the cosmic ray primaries , pions and kaons are @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively with @xmath39 .",
    "the muon spectral index is given by @xmath40 .",
