    "4c  + 49.22  is a powerful and core - dominated fsrq showing a bright and structured kiloparsec x - ray jet , diffuse thermal soft x - ray emission produced by the host galaxy and/or galaxy group medium , and a significant fluorescent @xmath6 emission line ( equivalent width @xmath54 ev ) from cold iron @xcite .",
    "the fe line detection indicates that even in the x - ray band the beamed jet emission in the low activity states does not completely swamp the accretion - related emission , qualifying this source as a good candidate to investigate the disc - jet connection with multi - frequency observations @xcite .",
    "this object is also a high luminosity fsrq characterised by a one - sided core - jet radio structure , where the strong and compact jet extends 6 mas ( i.e. about 28 pc ) in the south - west direction .",
    "the 5 ghz vlbi polarisation structure of the source is relatively simple @xcite , where fractional polarisation ( @xmath441% ) is basically concentrated in the core region , and the direction of the mas - scale magnetic field is consistent with jet direction .",
    "_ chandra _ resolved and identified in a hot spot of 4c  + 49.22   and compact x - ray substructures @xcite . finally simultaneous disc and blr",
    "luminosities show @xmath55 @xcite and the estimated mass of the smbh of 4c  + 49.22  is @xmath56 consistent with what was found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results can be summarised as follows .",
    "4c  + 49.22  is an fsrqs showing a shift of two orders of magnitude in the frequency of the synchrotron peak ( from @xmath57 hz to @xmath58 hz ) during the gev @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "this was accompanied by a contemporaneous marked spectral change in the x - ray energy band . in particular @xcite",
    "have shown that the distribution of synchrotron emission peaks of fsrqs are centred on a frequency of @xmath59 hz , and the change seen in 4c  + 49.22  can be interpreted as phenomenological transition from a fsrq to a bl lac object , with the thermal blue - bump overwhelmed by synchrotron jet emission during the flaring state .",
    "this phenomenology can be taken into account in blazar classification and demography paradigms @xcite",
    "even if occurring in short , transitory , phases of the blazar s life , and can be in agreement with some recent hypotheses suggesting a smooth transition between the division of blazars into bl lac objects and fsrqs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an example of a similar sed peak shift for flaring states is represented by the well - known fsrq pks 1510@xmath60089 @xcite .",
    "the marked spectral softening of the x - ray spectrum , providing an unusual flat x - ray sed , is also a feature observed in intermediate synchrotron energy peaked bl lac objects rather than fsrqs .",
    "in addition this soft x - ray spectrum does not show any distinct sign of a bulk - compton origin , generated by the adiabatic expansion of the emitting region and a cold population of electrons , a feature found usually in fsrqs but missing in this case .",
    "sed data therefore suggest a contribution to the x - ray emission from different emission components , i.e. both synchrotron and inverse compton ( ssc and/or erc ) mechanisms , as usually observed for intermediate energy peaked bl lac objects ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another interesting feature related to this is the optical spectrum .",
    "ssds dr7 and dr8 optical spectra @xcite , obtained during low emission states , show a rest frame equivalent width ( ew ) of the broad @xmath61 emission line of about 300   .",
    "we fitted the synchrotron bump of the sed during the @xmath0-ray flare epoch using a third degree polynomial function and we extrapolated using the best - fit model the value of the continuum at the @xmath61 frequency .",
    "provided that flux enhancement is due to non - thermal radiation only , the extrapolated continuum of 4c  + 49.22  at the frequency of the @xmath61 emission line shows an increase of a factor of @xmath62 during the @xmath0-ray flaring state , resulting in a reduction of the emission line ew to about 13 , therefore approaching the limit considered for the bl lac object class ( blazars with rest - frame emission line equivalent widths smaller than 5 ) .",
    "the usual classification of blazar subclasses using the rest frame ew definition can be misleading .",
    "objects so far classified as bl lac objects are turning out to be two physically different classes : intrinsically weak lined objects , more common in x - ray selected samples , and heavily jet - diluted broad lined sources , more frequent in radio selected samples @xcite .",
    "the multi - frequency seds ( figures [ fig : ssc ] and [ fig : ec ] ) show the synchrotron emission outshining the thermal blue - bump emission that appeared evident in the low activity state .",
    "we modeled the radio - to - gamma - ray seds for the flare state and the post - flare epoch .",
    "a single flaring blob with two different emission mechanisms ( ssc and erc ) and a two - zone model with a single ssc process were applied to our sed data .",
    "the averaged low state built with archival data ( gray points and blue bump signature in figures [ fig : ssc ] and [ fig : ec ] ) can be described by including both the jet and disc contributions while the single zone ssc model fails .",
    "the disc emission is parametrized in terms of a blackbody from optical to soft x - rays , and the erc modeling required also a torus emission component contributing to the ic scattering .",
    "our two - zone ssc and single zone ssc+erc model fits appears both appropriate to represent the observed high - state and post - flare sed of 4c  + 49.22 , depending on the considered feature ( equipartition ratio values , number of parameters , their values , agreements of parameters with previous model values estimated in literature , and agreement with vlba parameter values and structure ) .",
    "the ssc+erc is suggested to be slightly more preferred based on equipartition ratio , but the two - zone pure - ssc is still a valid alternative .",
    "the manifest thermal blue - bump is completely outshone by the non - thermal synchrotron emission during the flare , evidence which goes in the direction of the pure ssc scenario , that usually better represents the seds of bl lac objects .    on the other hand ,",
    "the multi - epoch vlba results presented in section [ sect : mojave ] can exclude flaring gev emission produced by jet knots placed at large distances , of the order of tens of parsecs @xcite , from the radio core and the blr region .",
    "this suggests a non - negligible contribution of seed photons produced in the blr for the ic up - scatter , strengthening the case for the hybrid ssc+erc scenario . in general equipartition",
    "can be strongly violated during large @xmath0-ray flare events .",
    "previous ssc models applied to the sed of 4c  + 49.22  and fits of radio - to - x - ray emission of _ chandra_-resolved subcomponents seen in the terminal part of the jet @xcite support this violation .",
    "this suggests ic scattering of synchrotron radiation by some special electron distribution with an excess of high - energy electrons , or cmb photons , or back - scattered central radiation . _",
    "fermi_-lat detected non - spatially resolved gev emission from 4c  + 49.22  and which may have been an integrated combination of emission from different regions . in this view",
    "the @xmath0-ray flaring state ( blue points in figures [ fig : ssc ] and [ fig : ec ] ) likely can be better represented by the double zone ssc scenario .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux of 4c  + 49.22  is variable with short time scales ( @xmath63 1 day ) .",
    "the rapid variability and the large @xmath0-ray luminosity imply appreciable pair production opacity .",
    "the unbeamed source size estimated from the observed variability timescale indicates that the source is opaque to the photon - photon pair production process if @xmath0-ray and x - ray photons are produced cospatially .",
    "this assumption , however , firmly rests on the simultaneity of the flaring event as observed by _ fermi_-lat and _ swift_-xrt .",
    "simultaneous x - ray and @xmath0-ray flare events have been measured in the past for other sources like 3c 454.3 @xcite .",
    "relativistic beamed jet and emission blobs can solve this problem .",
    "following the arguments given in @xcite and adopting the doubling flux timescale of @xmath64 days and the observed x - ray flux of @xmath65 ( as measured during the main flare in @xmath0 rays ) at the observed photon frequency @xmath66 hz ( corresponding to the photons that interact with the gev @xmath0 rays in the jet rest frame ) , we can estimate the doppler factor @xmath67 required for the photon - photon annihilation optical depth to be @xmath68 . with the derived relation : @xmath69 where we assume the emission region linear size @xmath70 cm and the source - frame photon energy @xmath71 . assuming the standard cosmology values we obtain @xmath72 . omitting the requirement of cospatiality of the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission regions relaxes this limit .",
    "this can be compared with the estimate obtained from the vlba superluminal motion , @xmath73 .",
    "as long as the velocity of the vlba jet is the same as the velocity of the outflow within the blazar emission zone , this implies that the photon - photon annihilation effects involving the x - ray emission generated within the jet are negligible .",
    "the location of the @xmath0-ray emitting region is debated , although large distances from the black hole are recently being favored for about 2/3 of gev fsrqs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ten epochs of vlba observations at 15 ghz ( mojave program ) of 4c  + 49.22  obtained from 2008 may to 2013 february point to lorentz factor limits that are consistent with our sed modeling and to increasing flux density and polarisation degree in the radio core after the gev @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "in addition , _ planck _",
    "simultaneous observations reveal spectral changes in the sub - mm regime associated with the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "our sed modeling is in agreement with multi - epoch vlba results and takes into account this evolution observed between the flare on may 15 ( blue sed data and table [ tab : blue ] ) and the post - flare ( may 17 - 25 ) epoch ( green sed data and table [ tab : green ] )",
    ". the resulting compact emission region of 4c  + 49.22  suggests that nuclear optical / uv seed target photons of the blr dominate the production of ic emission @xcite .",
    "alternatively if the volume involved in the @xmath0-ray emission is assumed much smaller than jet length scales , like turbulent plasma cells flowing across standing shocks @xcite , hour / day - scale variability can also be produced at several parsecs from the central engine .",
    "the vlba flux density and polarisation degree in the radio core both increased with the ejection of a new component close in time to the @xmath0-ray flare epoch .",
    "the jet kinetic power and disc luminosity of 4c  + 49.22  follow the same trend observed for other powerful @xmath0-ray fsrqs , where a large fraction of the accretion power is converted into bulk kinetic energy of the jet , and our sed models suggest a larger blr size compared to previous estimates @xcite .    @xmath74    the detailed results about 4c  + 49.22  presented in this work followed the availability of simultaneous _ fermi _ , _ swift _ , _ planck _  and vlba observations triggered by the lat - detected gev outburst and by our _ swift _  too follow - up program . such data allowed us to investigate multi - frequency flux versus radio - structure relationships , build and constrain pure - ssc vs ssc+erc sed physical model fits , study emission region localisation , energetics and the evolution of the multi - frequency and high - energy sed during two different emission states for the source , and finally to extrapolate phenomenological features alternatively supporting the fsrq or bl lac nature of the source .",
    "4c  + 49.22  is a powerful fsrq , with a fr ii morphology and possesses a powerful radio / x - ray jet , but it can have its broad emission lines heavily diluted by a swamping non - thermal continuum during high - energy events .",
    "the synchrotron peak energy and the unresolved x - ray spectra resemble those of intermediate bl lac objects .",
    "simultaneous multi - frequency data at low and high energies , from space - borne missions like _ fermi _ , _ swift _ , and _ planck",
