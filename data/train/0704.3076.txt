    "one of the fundamental questions of cosmology is whether the universe is infinite or finite , a question which is especially relevant in the context of string theory where several dimensions may be compact . with the move towards precision cosmology , it has become possible to study the topology of the universe up to the causal horizon which fundamentally limits our view of the world .",
    "many tests have recently been developed to detect and constrain the topology of the universe , see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "observationally a non - trivial topology can be detected directly with the observed map of cmb temperature and polarisation fluctuations through matched and correlated circles in the cmb  @xcite .",
    "the topology can also be searched for in the expansion of the cmb map in terms of spherical harmonics , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are the pixels and both the temperature field and the @xmath4 are random variables .",
    "the presence of a non - trivial topology introduces preferred directions , which breaks global isotropy and induces correlations between off - diagonal elements of the two - point correlation matrix @xmath5 .",
    "methods to find such off - diagonal correlations and to put optimal constraints on the size of the universe were proposed in ref .",
    "they are based on matching the measured correlations to a given correlation matrix through a correlation coefficient , as well as a maximum likelihood method and bayesian model comparison .",
    "so far the focus was purely on trying to detect any non - trivial topologies . however , to determine reliable limits , it is also necessary to understand all effects which can affect the detection . for this purpose , we study the impact of changing the cosmological parameters in the ranges allowed by present data .",
    "this should be seen as a step towards a rigorous search for the presence of signs of non - trivial topologies in the cmb .",
    "eventually , such an analysis should account for other contributions like foreground emissions as well as sky cuts .",
    "one additional reason to perform such a detailed analysis comes from statistics .",
    "the potentially most direct way to quantify the probability that our universe is infinite is to compute the model probability with bayesian evidence . to do this",
    ", one needs to integrate over all parameters , which means that one needs to know the behaviour of the likelihood for a topology under changes of the parameters .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we start by reviewing our notation and the likelihood - based probes of topology .",
    "we then study the main physical effects that are relevant for topology studies .",
    "finally we discuss how changes in the cosmological parameters affect our detection ability , and what this means for realistic universes where the parameters are not known with absolute certainty .",
    "in this section , all the simulations ( as described in refs .",
    "@xcite ) are based on a flat @xmath6cdm model with @xmath7 , a reduced hubble parameter of @xmath8 , a harrison - zeldovich initial power spectrum ( @xmath9 ) and a baryon density of @xmath10 . with this choice of cosmological parameters",
    "we find a hubble radius @xmath11 , while the radius of the particle horizon is @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to cubic tori , denoted as t[x , x , x ] where x is the size of the fundamental domain , in units of the hubble radius . as an example , t[4,4,4 ] is a cubic torus of size @xmath13 .",

    "the cmb likelihood is taken to be a multivariate gaussian distribution with covariance matrix @xmath18 and zero mean , @xmath19 .",

    "the infinite universe contains a maximum of information ( maximal entropy ) , while a finite ( `` small '' ) universe is less random .",
    "mathematically this is expressed through the non - zero correlations in the off - diagonal part of the two - point function which make it easier to predict the temperature distribution ( at least in theory ) .    a commonly used measure of information content is given by the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence between two probability distributions @xmath26 and @xmath27 , d_kl(p||q ) p ( ) . this quantity measures the relative information entropy between the two distributions .",

    "the kl divergence is the relative entropy to the topology described by the correlation matrix @xmath31 .",

    "then , at those scales several physical processes affect the cmb signal which may change our ability to detect non - trivial topologies and to measure their properties . in the following we will study the main effects , namely the reionisation and the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , in addition to the relative size of the particle horizon as well as tensor modes and defects . in the next section , we will vary the relevant cosmological parameters and study their influence on the detection of the topological signal .      as discussed in the introduction ,",

    "we can compute the particle horizon today in comoving coordinates from    _ 0 = _",

    "the strength of the topological signal depends ( among other things ) on the ratio of the two scales . a universe that is much smaller than the causal domain leaves a strong imprint in the cmb , while one that is much larger will be impossible to distinguish from a truly infinite universe .",

    "this can be done by averaging quantities over the orientation ( as is done for a bayesian study ) , or by taking the maximum over all orientations ( with the matched filter , or also when looking for correlated circles ) .",
    "the cmb photons are influenced by the change in the gravitational potential through which they must pass .",
    "the effects arising from time - variable metric perturbations are generally known as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect  @xcite in the linear regime and go by the names of rees - sciama effect  @xcite and the effect from moving halos  @xcite in the non - linear regime .",
    "the isw effect depends on the time derivative of the gravitational potential .",
    "the anisotropies due to the isw effect thus depend on the parameters of the background cosmology and are also tightly coupled to the clustering and the spatial and temporal evolution of the intervening structures . the most important contribution for topological studies",
    "is the late isw effect due to the decay of the gravitational potential  @xcite .",
    "this happens in a low matter density universe at the onset of dark energy ( or spatial curvature ) domination , when the increased rate of expansion of the universe reduces the amplitude of gravitational potential .",
