    "the unremitting interest in investigations of atmospheric acoustic - gravity waves ( agw ) over more than four decades dating back to hines pioneering work ( hines , 1960 , 1967 ) is dictated by the important role played by these waves in the dynamics of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "these research efforts have been addressed in a large number of publications , including a series of through reviews ( hocke and schlegel , 1996 ; oliver et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "agw typically show up in the ionosphere in the form of traveling ionospheric disturbances ( tids ) and are detected by various radio techniques .",
    "tids are classified as large- and medium - scale disturbances differing by their horizontal phase velocity which is larger ( in the large - scale case ) or smaller ( for the medium scale ) velocity of sound in the lower thermosphere ( on the order of 300 m / s ) , with periods within 0.53.0 h and 1040 min , respectively .",
    "medium - scale tids ( ms tids ) are observed predominantly during the daytime hours and are associated with agw which are generated in the lower atmosphere .",
    "large - scale tids are predominant in the night - time hours and are closely associated with geomagnetic and auroral activity .",
    "it is known that the sources of medium - scale agw can include natural processes of a different origin : magnetic storms , auroral phenomena , weather factors , tropospheric turbulence and jet flows , the solar terminator , strong earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , as well as anthropogenic influences ( rocket launchings , explosions , nuclear tests ) . as a consequence",
    "the observed picture of the electron density disturbance is essentially a net interference wave field of the agw of a different origin .",
    "identifying of the agw of a definite type from this field is a highly involved and generally an almost intractable problem .",
    "the most reliable measurements of the main parameters of medium - scale agw ( parameters of the wave vector of the agw , spectral and dispersion characteristics , etc . ) can therefore be made only for a very rare , unusual type of ms tids , i.e. quasi - periodic ( monochromatic ) oscillations which are sometimes recorded as corresponding variations of the frequency doppler shift @xmath0 of the ionosphere - reflected hf radio signal ( davies and jones , 1971 ; waldock and jones , 1987 ; jacobson and carlos , 1991 ; yakovets et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "experiments of this kind were instrumental in investigating the spatial - temporal characteristics of ms tids in the form of a wave process , because such recordings are easy to identify visually with monochromatic individual agw .",
    "unfortunately , this was possible to accomplish for a very limited body of experimental data .",
    "thus , jacobson and carlos ( 1991 ) managed to identify only a few monochromatic tids from their data obtained for more than 100 hours of observation .",
    "yakovets et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also recorded only a few realizations of monochromatic tids for two observing periods from the winter months of 1989 and 1990 .",
    "yakovets et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are likely to be the first to use the term `` wave packets '' to designate the quasi - monochromatic variations of @xmath0 , and they made an attempt to explain their origin on the basis of studying the phase structure of the oscillations .",
    "the authors of the cited reference observed two types of @xmath0-variations : quasi - stochastic tids , and monochromatic tids in the form of wave packets .",
    "they arrived at the conclusion that quasi - stochastic tids are characterized by a random phase behavior , a short length of coherence , and by a large vertical phase velocity .",
    "wave packets show quasi - monochromatic oscillations of @xmath0 , a larger length of coherence , and a smaller vertical phase velocity .    following yakovets et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we chose to utilize the term `` wave packets '' by expanding it to the term `` traveling wave packets '' ( twps ) . the investigation made in this paper",
    "has brought out clearly that this designation describes most adequately the phenomenon involved .",
    "some authors associate the variations of the frequency doppler shift @xmath0 with ms tids that are generated during the passage of atmospheric fronts , tornadoes , and hurricanes ( baker and davies , 1969 ; bertin et al .",
    ", 1975 ; 1978 ; hung et al . , 1978 ; kersly and rees , 1982 ; stobie et al . , 1983",
    "; huang et al . , 1985 ) .",
    "it is only in some cases that these experiments observed quasi - monochromatic variations of @xmath0 with periods of about 10 min ( huang et al . , 1985 ) .",
    "thus , in spite of the many years of experimental and theoretical studied , so far there is no clear understanding not only of the physical origin of the quasi - monochromatic ms tids but even of their morphology as well ( the occurrence frequency as a function of geographical location , time , level of geomagnetic and meteorological activity , etc . ) .    to address these issues requires obtaining statistically significant sets of experimental data with good spatial resolution in order to study not only the morphological but also dynamic characteristics of quasi - monochromatic ms tids ( the direction of their displacement , their propagation velocity , and the location of the possible disturbance source ) .",
    "another important requirement implies the continuous , global character of observations , because such phenomena are temporally highly rare and spatially random .",
    "such a possibility is , for the first time , afforded by the use of the international ground - based network of two - frequency receivers of the navigation gps system which at the beginning of 2002 consisted of no less than 1000 sites , with its data posted on the internet , which opens up a new era of a global , continuous and fully computerized monitoring of ionospheric disturbances of a different class .",
    "analysis and identification of twps became possible through the use of the technology ( developed at the istp ) for global detection and determination of parameters of ionospheric disturbances of a different class .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study the morphology and spatial - temporal properties of twps using the data from the global network of gps receivers .",
    "section 2 provides general information about the experiment and gives a brief description of the method of twps detecting .",
    "section 3 presents our new evidence characterizing the twps morphology .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a detailed analysis of the spatial - temporal properties of twps by considering an example of the most pronounced manifestation of twps on october 18 , 2001 as observed in california , usa . the discussion of our results compared with the findings reported by other authors is given in section 5 .",
    "this paper presents , for the first time , the morphology of twps for 105 days of 19982001 , with a different level of geomagnetic activity and with the number of stations of the global gps network ranging from 10 to 300 . a total number of he tec series used in the analysis , corresponding to the observation along a single receiver - satellite line - of - sight ( los ) , with a duration of each series of about 2.3 hours , exceeded 700000 .    for a diversity of reasons",
    ", slightly differing sets of gps stations were selected for different events to be analyzed ; however , the geometry of experiment for all events was virtually identical .",
    "the stations coordinates are not given here for reasons of space .",
    "this information may be found at the electronic address http://lox.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/allcoords.cgi ? .",
    "the global gps covers rather densely north america and europe , and to a much lesser extent asia .",
    "gps stations are more sparsely distributed on the pacific and atlantic oceans .",
    "however , such coverage of the surface of the globe makes it possible , already today , to tackle the problem of global detection of disturbances with hither to unprecedented spatial accumulation .",
    "thus , in the western hemisphere the corresponding number of stations can reach no less than 500 already today , and the number of los to the satellite can be no less than 20003000 .",
    "the area of california , usa , is particular convenient for our investigations because of the large number of gps stations ( no less than 300 ) located over a relatively small area , which makes it possible to obtain a great variety of gps arrays of a different configuration for a reliable determination of the dynamic twps parameters using the method of gps interferometry of tids ( afraimovich et al . , 1998 ; 2000 ) .",
    "the comparison of twps characteristics with geomagnetic field variations was based on using the data from the intermagnet network ( intermagnet , http://www.intermagnet.org/ ) .",
    "the standard gps technology provides a means for wave disturbances detecion based on phase measurements of tec @xmath1 ( hofmann - wellenhof et al . , 1992 ) :",
    "@xmath2\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are additional paths of the radio signal caused by the phase delay in the ionosphere , ( m ) ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the number of phase rotations at the frequencies @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 stand for the corresponding wavelengths , ( m ) ; @xmath11   is the unknown initial phase ambiguity , ( m ) ; and @xmath12   are errors in determining the phase path , ( m ) .",
    "phase measurements in the gps can be made with a high degree of accuracy corresponding to the error of tec determination of at least @xmath13 m@xmath14 when averaged on a 30-second time interval , with some uncertainty of the initial value of tec , however ( hofmann - wellenhof et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "this makes possible detecting ionization irregularities and wave processes in the ionosphere over a wide range of amplitudes ( up to @xmath15 of the diurnal tec variation ) and periods ( from 24 hours to 5 min ) .",
    "the unit of tec , which is equal to @xmath16 m@xmath14  ( @xmath17 ) and is commonly accepted in the literature , will be used in the following .    in some instances a convenient way for comparing tec response characteristics from the gps data with those obtained by analyzing the frequency doppler shift in the hf range ( davies and jones , 1971 ; waldock and jones , 1987 ; jacobson and carlos , 1991 ; yakovets et al . , 1999 )",
    "is to estimate the frequency doppler shift @xmath0 from tec series obtained by formula ( 1 ) . to an approximation sufficient for the purpose of our investigation ,",
    "a corresponding relationship was obtained by ( davies , 1969 ) :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 stands for the time derivative of tec .",
    "primary data include series of `` oblique '' values of tec @xmath20 , as well as the corresponding series of elevations @xmath21 and azimuths @xmath22 along los to the satellite calculated using our developed convtec program which converts the gps system standard rinex - files on the internet ( gurtner , 1993 ) . for twps characteristics to be determined continuous series of @xmath20 series of a duration of no less than 2.3 hours",
    "are chosen .    to normalize the response amplitude we converted the `` oblique '' tec to an equivalent `` vertical '' value ( klobuchar , 1986 ) :    @xmath23,\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the earth s radius , and",
    "@xmath25 km is the height of the @xmath26-layer maximum .",
    "the most reliable results from the determination of twps parameters correspond to high values of elevations @xmath21 of the beam to the satellite because sphericity effects become reasonably small .",
    "all results in this study were obtained for elevations @xmath21 larger than 30@xmath27 .    to exclude the variations of the regular ionosphere , as well as trends introduced by the motion of the satellite , we employ the procedure of removing the linear trend by preliminarily smoothing the initial series with a convenient time window .",
    "the technology for global detection of twps that was developed at the istp sb ras makes it possible to select  from a large amount of experimental material in the automatic mode  the tec disturbances which can be assigned to a class of twps .",
    "the selection of tec series which could be ascribed to a class of twps was carried out by two criteria ( fig .",
    "first of all , tec variations were selected , for which the value of the standard deviation exceeded a given threshold @xmath28 ( in the present case @xmath28 = 0.1 @xmath17 ) .    in addition , for each filtered series , we verified the fulfillment of the `` quasi - monochromaticity '' condition of tec oscillations , for which the ratio @xmath29 of a total spectral signal power in the selected frequency band @xmath30 in the neighborhood of a maximum value of the power @xmath31 , to a total spectral signal power outside the frequency band @xmath30 under consideration exceeded a given threshold @xmath32 ( in the present case @xmath32 = 2 ) .",
    "1 illustrates the selection process of the twps .",
    "1a gives an example of weakly disturbed variations of the `` vertical '' tec @xmath33 as recorded on july 15 , 2001 at station darw ( @xmath34e ; @xmath35s ; satellite number prn05 ) .",
    "1b presents the @xmath36-variations that were filtered from the initial @xmath33-series .",
    "thin horizontal lines show the specified threshold @xmath28 .",
    "the standard deviation of the @xmath36-variations is 0.019 @xmath17 , that is , does not reach the specified threshold @xmath28 = 0.1 @xmath17 .",
    "1c illustrates the @xmath37 spectrum of the series @xmath36 from fig .",
    "thin vertical lines show the boundaries of the frequency range @xmath30 . for this",
    "spectrum @xmath29 = 0.66 is smaller than the specified @xmath32 = 2 and , hence , the series @xmath36 does not satisfy the condition of `` quasi - monochromaticity '' .",
    "1d , 1e and 1f plots the same dependencies as in fig .",
    "1a , 1b and 1c but for station tow2 ( @xmath38e ; @xmath39s ; satellite number prn09 ) .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "1d that at the background of the slow tec variations there are clearly identifiable ( unusual for background tec disturbances ) oscillations in the form of a wave packet of a duration of about 1 hour and with a typical period @xmath40 in the range from 10 to 18 min .",
    "the oscillation amplitude of the detected wave packet exceeds one order of magnitude ( as a minimum ) the intensity of background tec fluctuations of this range of periods ( afraimovich et al . , 2001a ) .",
    "the relative amplitude of such a response @xmath41 is considerable , 4 @xmath42 . as the background value of @xmath1 we used the absolute `` vertical '' tec value of @xmath20 for the site located at @xmath43s ; @xmath38e , obtained from ionex tec maps ( mannucci , 1998 ) . since the main contribution to the modulation of the tec is made by the region near the ionospheric @xmath44-region peak , the relative amplitude of the local electron density disturbance @xmath45 in this region can be several times larger than @xmath41 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the two examples described above refer to the same time interval and to the stations spaced by a distance of no more than 1900 km from one another .",
    "this suggests a local character of the phenomenon and is in agreement with the overall sample statistic characterizing its spatial correlation ( see below ) .    the standard deviation of the series @xmath36 , shown in fig .",
    "1e , is 0.114 @xmath17 , which is larger than the specified threshold @xmath28=0.1 @xmath17 , and this series satisfies the condition for the standard deviation .",
    "1f presents the spectrum @xmath37 of the series @xmath36 , shown in fig .",
    "1e . for this spectrum @xmath29 = 3.71 , which is larger than the specified @xmath32 = 2 , that is , in this case the series @xmath36 satisfies the condition of `` quasi - monochromaticity '' .    panel * e * shows the maximum value of the amplitude @xmath46 of the packet and the time @xmath47 corresponding to this amplitude .",
    "when the filtered di(t)-series satisfied the conditions described above , such an event was recognized as twp .    furthermore , for each such event , a special file stored information about the name , geographical latitude @xmath48 and longitude @xmath49 of the gps station ; the gps satellite prn number ; the time @xmath47 corresponding to the maximum value of the amplitude @xmath46 of the twp ; the amplitude @xmath46 ; the twp oscillation period @xmath40 ; the @xmath29 ratio ; and about the value of the elevation @xmath50 and the azimuth @xmath51 of the los to the satellite calculated for the time @xmath47 . the sample statistic , presented below , was obtained by processing such files for our selected value of @xmath28=0.1 @xmath17 .",
    "the method outlined above was used to obtain a series of twps totaling about 1300 cases , or about 0.2@xmath42 of the total number of the radio paths considered ( receiver - satellite los ) . as has been pointed out above",
    ", the radio paths that were considered totaled over 700000 .",
    "an analysis of the resulting statistic revealed a number of dependencies of the twps parameters on different factors .",
    "first of all , we consider the seasonal dependence of the density and amplitude of the twps ( fig .",
    "2 ) . fig .",
    "2a plots the dependence of the number of days of observation @xmath52 on the time of the year .",
    "it is evident that statistically , the autumn season is represented best .",
    "2b shows the seasonal dependence of the number of twps @xmath53 .",
    "2c plots the number of twps @xmath54 per day as a function of time of the year .",
    "this dependence has maxima in winter and in autumn .",
    "the relative twps density @xmath55 , obtained as the ratio of the number of twps @xmath53 to the number of receiver - satellite los , is presented in fig .",
    "as is apparent from the figure , twps are observed in no more than 0.1 - 0.4@xmath42 of the total number of radio paths , and much more frequently in winter ( over 0.4@xmath42 ) and autumn ( up to 0.3@xmath42 ) than in spring and summer ( less than 0.1@xmath42 ) .",
    "diamonds in fig .",
    "2d show the mean values of @xmath56 of the maximum twps amplitudes @xmath46 for each season , and vertical lines show their standard deviations .",
    "thick horizontal line shows the threshold in amplitude @xmath28=0.1 @xmath17 .",
    "the most probable value of @xmath56 with a small scatter varies around the value 0.3 @xmath17 , irrespective of the season .",
    "3d presents the normalized occurrence probability distribution of twps with the specified maximum amplitude of the packet @xmath46 .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the threshold in amplitude @xmath28=0.1 @xmath17 .",
    "it was found that the most probable value of the amplitude @xmath57 , also shown in fig .",
    "3d , is about 0.3 @xmath17 , and the half - width of the distribution is 0.2 @xmath17 . as was shown by afraimovich et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , the mean values of the tec variation amplitude with the period of 20 min for the magnetically quiet and magnetically disturbed days do not exceed 0.01 @xmath17 and 0.07 @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "thus the most probable value of the amplitude @xmath57 of twps exceeds the mean value of the tec variation amplitude by a factor of 46 as a minimum .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the variation amplitude of the frequency doppler shift @xmath0 reported by yakovets et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "3b presents the diurnal distribution @xmath58 of the times @xmath47 corresponding to the maximum value of the amplitude @xmath46 of the wave packet of twps .",
    "it is evident that most of the twps ( about 87@xmath42 ) are observed during the daytime , from about 7:00 to 16:00 of local time , lt .",
    "3a plots the dependence @xmath59 of the number of twps on the values of the geomagnetic activity index @xmath60 taken by the modulus .",
    "there is a general tendency of the number of twps to increase with the decreasing level of geomagnetic activity .",
    "most ( about 92@xmath42 ) of the twps occur when the values of the @xmath60-index are smaller than 100 nt .",
    "the availability of a large number of gps stations in some regions of the globe ( in california , usa and west europe , for example ) makes it possible to determine not only the temporal but also spatial characteristics of twps . to estimate the radius of spatial correlation of events of this type we calculated the number of cases where",
    "the twps within a single 2.3-hour time interval were observed at any two gps stations separated by @xmath61 .",
    "3c presents the histogram of values of @xmath62 as a function of distance @xmath61 .",
    "it was found that the localization of the twps in space is strongly pronounced . in 82@xmath42 of cases",
    "the distance @xmath61 does not exceed 500 km .",
    "using the method of gps interferometry of tids ( afraimovich et al . , 1998 ; 2000 ) , we carried out a detailed analysis of the spatial - temporal properties of twps by considering an example of the most pronounced manifestation of twps on october 18 , 2001 over california , usa .",
    "numerous traveling ionospheric disturbances of the type of twps were recorded on that day between 15:00 and 18:00 ut using signals from several satellites , at many gps stations located in california .",
    "the area of california within @xmath63e ; @xmath64n is convenient for our investigations because of a large number of gps stations located there , which makes it possible to obtain a great variety of gps arrays of a different configuration for determining the tid parameters and provides a means of verifying the reliability of calculated data .",
    "it is also important that for the above - mentioned time interval 15:18 ut and for the chosen longitude range the local time varied from 08 to 11 lt , which reduces the level of background tec fluctuations characteristic for the night - time .    fig .",
    "4 illustrates the geometry of the experiment of october 18 , 2001 .",
    "heavy dots show the gps stations , and small dots show the position of subionospheric points for gps receiver - satellite los .",
    "since each receiver site observes simultaneously several ( no less than four ) gps satellites , the number of radio paths far exceeds the number of stations , which enhances the capabilities of analysis . fig .",

    "may be characterized as a weakly disturbed one , which must lead to some increase of the level of background tec fluctuations yet can not cause large - scale changes in electron density characteristic for a geomagnetically disturbed ionosphere .",
    "geomagnetic field @xmath60-variations for october 18 , 2001 are plotted in fig .",
    "5a . in the analysis of the geomagnetic situation we used also the data from magnetic observatory victoria ( @xmath65n ; @xmath66e ) where for the time interval of our interest a weak geomagnetic disturbance was recorded , which implied a decrease of the horizontal component @xmath67 of the magnetic field by 60 nt ( fig .",

    "the range of variation of the geomagnetic @xmath60-index for the selected time interval was also relatively small ( no more than 20 nt ) , yet the period 15:30 - 18:00 ut showed a clearly pronounced decrease of the @xmath60-index coinciding with the period of the decrease of the @xmath69-component of the magnetic field ( fig .",

    "between 15:00 and 19:00 ut , the enhancement of the oscillations of the @xmath69-component was accompanied by an expansion of the spectrum and by an increase of the tec fluctuation amplitude . the highest intensity is shown by the tec oscillations with periods of 1217 min between 15:30 and 17:00 ut . the largest number of twps was also recorded during the same period of time ( fig .",

    "the methods of determining the form and dynamic characteristics of tids that are used in this study are based on those reported in ( mercier , 1986 ; afraimovich , 1995 ; 1997 ; afraimovich et al .",
    ", 1998 ; 1999 ) .",
    "we determine the velocity and direction of motion of the phase interference pattern ( phase front ) in terms of some model of this pattern , an adequate choice of which is of critical importance . in the simplest form ,",
    "space - time variations in phase of the transionospheric radio signal that are proportional to tec variations @xmath73 in the ionosphere , at each given time @xmath74 can be represented in terms of the phase interference pattern that moves without a change in its shape ( the non dispersive disturbances ) :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the velocities of intersection of the phase front of the axes x ( directed to the east ) and y ( directed to the north ) , respectively .",
    "a special case of ( 4 ) is the most often used model for a solitary , plane travelling wave of tec disturbance :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 are space - time variations of tec ; @xmath80 $ ]  the amplitude ;",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 are the @xmath84- and @xmath85- projections of the wave vector @xmath86 , and the angular frequency of the disturbance , respectivly ; @xmath87 is the initial disturbance phase ; @xmath88 is the time when the disturbance has a maximum amplitude ; @xmath89 is the half - thickness of the wave packet.    it should be noticed , however , that in real situations neither of these ideal models ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) are realized in a pure form .",
    "this is because that the agw that cause tids propagate in the atmosphere in the form of a dispersing wave packet with a finite value of the width of the angular spectrum .",
    "but in the first approximation on short time interval of averaging compared to time period of filtered variations of tec , the phase interference pattern moves without a substantial change in its shape .",
    "mercier ( 1986 ) suggested a statistical method to analyze the phase interference pattern .",
    "primary data comprise time dependencies of the spatial phase derivatives @xmath90 and @xmath91 along the directions @xmath85 and @xmath84 .",
    "method mercier ( 1986 ) involves determining a series of instantaneous values of the direction @xmath22    @xmath92    and constructing subsequently , on a chosen time interval , the distribution function of azimuth @xmath93 .",
    "the central value of @xmath94 is used by mercier as an estimate of the azimuth of prevailing propagation of tids ( modulo 180@xmath95 ) .",
    "the other method is based on analyzing the phase interference pattern anisotropy in the antenna array plane by determining the contrast @xmath96 of the interference pattern ( mercier , 1986 ) . in this case",

    "mercier ( 1986 ) showed that it is possible to find such a value of the rotation angle @xmath105 , at which the ratio @xmath97 will be a maximum and equal to the value of contrast @xmath96 .",

    "the angle @xmath105 in this case indicates the direction of elongation , and the angle @xmath106 indicates the direction of the wave vector @xmath86 coincident ( modulo 180@xmath95 ) with the propagation direction of the phase front .",
    "the method of mercier ( 1986 ) essentially makes it possible to determine only the anisotropy and the direction of irregularity elongation of the phase interference pattern ( modulo 180@xmath95 ) .    a statistical ,",
    "angle - of - arrival and doppler method ( sadm ) is proposed by afraimovich ( 1995 , 1997 ) for determining characteristics of the dynamics of the phase interference pattern in the horizontal plane by measuring variations of phase derivatives with respect not only to spatial coordinates @xmath91 and @xmath90 - proportional to the angles of arrival variations , but additionally to time @xmath107 - proportional to the frequency doppler shift variations .",
    "this permits to ascertain the unambiguous orientation of @xmath22 of the wave - vector @xmath86 in the range 0360@xmath95 and determine the horizontal velocity modulus @xmath108 at each specific in - stant of time .",
    "afraimovich et al.(1998 , 1999 ) described updating of the sadm algorithm for gps - arrays ( sadm - gps ) based on a simple model for the displacement of the phase interference pattern that travels without a change in the shape and on using current information about angular coordinates of the gps satellites : the elevation @xmath50 and the azimuth @xmath51 .",
    "of course , such an approximation is acceptable only for large values of the los elevation @xmath109 .",
    "the method sadm - gps permits to determine the horizontal velocity @xmath108 and the azimuth @xmath22 of tid displacement at each specific in - stant of time ( the wave - vector orientation @xmath86 ) in a fixed coordinate system ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) :    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the propagation velocities of the phase front along the axes @xmath84 and @xmath85 in a frame of reference related to the gps - array ; @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the @xmath84 and @xmath85 projections of the velocity @xmath115 of the subionospheric point ( for taking into account the motion of the satellite ) .",

    "three points ( a , b , c ) are chosen in such a way that the distances between them do not exceed about one - half the expected wavelength @xmath121 of the disturbance .",

    "since the distance between gps - array elements ( from several tens to a few hundred of kilometers ) is much smaller than that to the gps satellite ( over 20000  km ) , the array geometry at the height near the main maximum of the @xmath26-layer is identical to that on the ground .",

    "as a first approximation , the transionospheric sounding method is responsive only to tids with the wave vector @xmath126 perpendicular to the direction @xmath135 of the los . a corresponding condition for elevation @xmath125 and azimuth @xmath94 has the form    @xmath136",
    "hence the phase velocity modulus @xmath137 can be defined as    @xmath138    the aspect dependence ( 12 ) of the tec disturbance amplitude is of significant importance for investigating wave disturbances .",
    "the condition ( 12 ) imposes a constraint on the number of los for which a reliable detection of tids at the background of noise is possible .",
    "the aspect effect causes the disturbance maximum to be displaced along the time axis , which can introduce errors in determining the tid displacement if the velocity is calculated from time delays . furthermore , as will be shown below , the aspect effect will give rise to structures of the type of wave packets `` observed '' in tec variations , which do not exist in the reality .",

    "4c ) by use of the sadm - gps method provided distributions of the main twp parameters recorded on october 18 , 2001 in california .",

    "this distribution virtually coincides with @xmath93 , suggesting that the twp travel across their elongation .",

    "7 illustrates a good similarity of the experimental and model tec variations @xmath33 , @xmath36 and the dependencies @xmath108 and @xmath22 .",
    "noteworthy is the weaker inclination of the model tec @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "7e ) when compared with the experimental one ( fig .",
    "7a ) . this is because for the sake of simplicity and for illustrative purposes , diurnal variations in ionization in the model are proportional to the cosine of the zenith angle of the sun . in actual conditions the dependence is more complicated , which gives a faster temporal growth of the tec .",
    "because the trend is removed in the subsequent discussion and only the relative tec variations @xmath36 are considered , the above - mentioned difference in the behavior of the model and experimental tec will not affect results obtained .",
    "a comparison of the tec disturbance parameters specified in the model with the corresponding values obtained following a processing by formulas of the sadm - gps method shows a relatively good agreement of these values .",
    "the azimuth of the wave vector of twp was taken to be @xmath162 , and the mean value of the azimuth calculated by the sadm - gps method is @xmath163 ( fig .  7 g , and fig .",
    "8e ) ; the horizontal velocity was specified equal to 180  m / s , the calculated mean value of the velocity was 207.5  m / s ( fig . 7h , and fig .",
    "8d ) ; the elevation in the model was @xmath164 , and the most probable value of the calculated elevation was @xmath165 ( fig .",
    "the azimuth of twp propagation determined by the sadm - gps method was also close to the azimuth values calculated by analyzing the contrast of the phase interference pattern ( mercier , 1986 )  fig .",

    "let us now consider the possible mechanisms that are responsible for the formation of structures of the type of pulsations in observed tec variations .",
    "the recorded tec pulsation represents a single wave packet with a duration of about 60 min , the oscillation period inside the packet of 1215 min , and with the amplitude exceeding the level of background fluctuations by a factor of 25 ( fig .",
    "structures of such a type can be produced in tec variations in different ways .    if a monochromatic wave with a period of about 15 min ( the period of observed tec variations ) propagates in the ionosphere , then tec oscillations of the type of pulsations could be produced through the aspect effect .",
    "9a , d illustrates such a situation .",
    "panels * a * and * d * present the filtered tec series obtained by modeling a single plane wave under different conditions of its observation . at the bran site ( fig .",
    "9a ) the elevations of the prn14 satellite are close to 90@xmath27 , and the wave vector of the disturbance is perpendicular to the receiver - satellite los throughout the observing period .",
    "this is indicated by the character of the theoretical dependence @xmath166 calculated by formula ( 14 ) for this los : @xmath166 is close to 1 over the entire observing interval ( fig .",
    "waves disturbances of the tec close to the specified monochromatic wave are therefore observed along the bran ",
    "prn14 los .    at the bru1 site for prn05 ,",
    "the detection conditions for disturbances are significantly worse . in this case for the first half an hour the wave propagates virtually along the los ( @xmath167 , fig .",
    "9f ) , and at the end of the observing interval he bru1prn15 los is perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave but has low elevations ( @xmath168 , fig .",
    "9f ) . owing to this",
    ", tec variations show an increase in the oscillation amplitude from 0 to 0.7 @xmath17  there arises a feature resembling a wave packet that was absent in the initial specified model of the wave .",
    "however , as is evident from the figure , in this case the increase in the tec variation amplitude has an almost linear character while the experiment ( fig .",
    "7b ) shows a nonlinear amplitude modulation .",
    "an investigation of the character of the aspect dependence for all gps arrays that were used in this study , showed that in 97% of cases ( including those shown in fig .",
    "7b ) the situation is realized , which is depicted in fig .",
    "9c , i.e. @xmath166 is close to 1 throughout this observing interval . considering all that has been said above , one can draw the conclusion that the recorded tec pulsations are indeed caused by the propagation of an actual wave packet of a local density disturbance in the ionosphere rather than resulting from the recording conditions .",
    "another possibility of the production of a twp is the combination of two or several monochromatic waves with close periods propagating in the ionosphere ( yakovets et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "we modeled the propagation of two quasi - horizontal waves with periods @xmath154=15  min and @xmath157=12  min by identical amplitudes , velocities and directions of propagation .",
    "the resulting tec variations along two los : bran  prn14 , and bru1prn05 , with the trend removed , are presented in fig . 9b and 9e , respectively .    as would be expected ,",
    "there arise amplitude - modulated tec oscillations with the modulation period of about @xmath169=60  min .",
    "the period is close to the length of the wave packet recorded experimentally ; however , a simple superposition of two waves gives not one but a whole chain of wave packets . in the case where the aspect effect affects little the character of tec variations ( fig .",
    "9c ) these packets have , in addition , different amplitudes as well ( fig .",
    "a phase change of the combined waves affects little the picture presented here by altering the form and position of the amplitude minimum only slightly . the aspect dependence in fig .",
    "9f , however , introduces an additional modulation into the recorded signal - there occurs a significant enhancement of one of the chain s packets ( fig .",
    "9e ) , and the picture approaches what is observed experimentally in fig .",
    "nevertheless , it can not be believed that the observed single twps are the result of the aspect effect .",
    "firstly , in the case of the aspect modulation , because of the slow(nearly linear ) change of the amplitude , not one but at least two wave packets are observed .",
    "secondly , as has been pointed out above , the character of the aspect dependence in most cases of twp recordings was such that it affected little the amplitude of disturbances . to obtain the closets tec oscillations to those observed experimentally we had to introduce an artificial modulation , i.e.",
    "the amplitude of the initial monochromatic wave of the disturbance @xmath152 was specified not constant but it had a time dependence in the form of a gaussian function .",
    "it is such a model of tec variations that is shown in fig .",
    "sequences of wave packets similar to the ones shown in fig .  6 at the left , were recorded in frequency doppler variations with the multifrequency doppler ionosonde at almaty ( yakovets et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the recordings of the frequency doppler shift presented clearly show chains of wave packets ( on the average , 23 wave packets with the record length of about 8  hours ) .",
    "the duration of the wave packets averaged 90  min , and the oscillation period in a packet averaged 16  min .",
    "the authors of the cited reference observed two types of fd - variations : quasi - stochastic tids , and monochromatic tids in the form of wave packets .",
    "they concluded that quasi - stochastic tids are characterized by a random behavior of the phase , a small length of coherence , and by a large vertical phase velocity .",
    "wave packets show quasi - monochromatic oscillations , a larger length of coherence , and a smaller vertical phase velocity .",
    "our estimate of the radius of spatial correlation ( on the order of several hundred kilometers ) is in reasonably good agreement with the data reported by yakovets et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "yakovets et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argued that the observed wave packets are the superposition of the direct and ground - reflected wave whose source lies in the troposphere .",
    "the analysis made in this paper did not confirm the validity of such an explanation for the october 18 , 2001 twp .    by comparing our detected tec pulsations with the data from ( yakovets et al .",
    ", 1999 ; hines , 1960 ; waldock and jones , 1984 ; francis , 1974 ) as well as with the findings of our modeling , it can be assumed that in the atmosphere there exists an additional amplitude modulation mechanism for wave processes which make sit possible to obtain tec oscillations in the form of a single wave packet .",
    "francis ( 1974 ) , by considering the auroral electrojet to be the source of tids , showed that upon propagating through the atmosphere into the @xmath44-region , the ground - reflected waves acquire the properties of a wave packet .",
    "on the basis of the dispersion relation hines ( 1960 ) and waldock and jones ( 1984 ) showed that tids that are associated with a tropospheric jet flow occur in the @xmath44-region in the form of a wave packet with quasi - monochromatic oscillations , the period of which is a function of inclination angle of the wave vector during the propagation of the wave from the source to the place of observation in the @xmath44-region .",
    "our data on the twp displacement velocity and direction correspond to those of mid - latitude medium - scale traveling ionospheric disturbances ( ms tids ) obtained previously in the analysis of phase characteristics of hf radio signals ( kalikhman , 1980 ; afraimovich , 1982 ; waldock and jones , 1984 ; 1986 ; 1987 ; jacobson and carlos , 1991 ) , as well as signals from first - generation navigation satellites ( spoelstra , 1992 ) , geostationary satellites ( afraimovich et al . , 1997b ; jacobson et al . , 1995 ) and",

    "<S> we identified a new class of mid - latitude medium - scale traveling ionospheric disturbances ( ms tids ) , viz . traveling wave packets ( twps ) of total electron content ( tec ) disturbances . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , the morphology of twps is presented for 105 days from the time interval 1998 - 2001 with a different level of geomagnetic activity , with the number of stations of the global gps network ranging from 10 to 300 . </S>",
    "<S> the radio paths used in the analysis total about 700000 . </S>",
    "<S> these data were obtained using the globdet technology for global detection and monitoring of ionospheric disturbances of natural and technogenic origin from measurements of tec variations acquired by a global network of receivers of the navigation gps system . </S>",
    "<S> the globdet technology was developed at the istp sb ras . using the technique of gps interferometry of tids we carried out a detailed analysis of the spatial - temporal properties of twps by considering an example of the most conspicuous manifestation of twps on october 18 , 2001 over california , usa . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that twps are observed no more than in 0.1 - 0.4% of all radio paths , most commonly during the daytime in winter and autumn at low geomagnetic activity . </S>",
    "<S> twps in the time range represent quasi - periodic oscillations of tec of a length on the order of 1 hour with the oscillation period in the range 10 - 20 min and the amplitude exceeding the amplitude of `` background '' tec fluctuations by one order of magnitude , as a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of spatial correlation of twps does not exceed 500600 km ( 35 wavelengths ) . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity and direction of twps correspond to those of mid - latitude medium - scale traveling ionospheric disturbances ( ms tids ) obtained previously from analyzing the phase characteristics of hf radio signals as well as signals from geostationary satellites and discrete cosmic radio sources . </S>"
