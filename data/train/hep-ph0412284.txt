    "<S> we investigate a possible nuclear correction to the nutev measurement of the weak - mixing angle @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a nuclear modification difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 distributions contributes to the nutev measurement with the iron target . </S>",
    "<S> first , the modification difference is determined by a @xmath3 analysis so as to reproduce nuclear data on the structure function @xmath4 and drell - yan processes . </S>",
    "<S> then , taking the nutev kinematics into account , we calculate a contribution to the @xmath0 determination . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , its uncertainty is estimated by the hessian method . </S>",
    "<S> although the uncertainty becomes comparable to the nutev deviation , the effect is not large enough to explain the whole nutev @xmath0 anomaly at this stage . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is difficult to determine such a nuclear modification difference , so that we need further investigations on the difference and its effect on the nutev anomaly . </S>"
