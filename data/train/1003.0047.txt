    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely believed to be the theory of the strong interactions .",
    "investigations on its rich vacuum structure and how the qcd vacuum can be modified in extreme environment are among the major theoretical challenges in modern physics .",
    "it is in particular an interesting topic to study how non - perturbative features of qcd are affected by thermal excitations at high temperature @xmath1 and/or by baryon - rich constituents at large baryon ( quark ) chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "such research on hot and dense qcd is important not only from the theoretical point of view but also for numerous applications to the physics problems of the quark - gluon plasma ( copiously produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ) , ultra - dense and cold nuclear / quark matter as could exist in the interior of compact stellar objects , and so on .",
    "the most intriguing non - perturbative aspects of the qcd vacuum at low energy are color confinement and spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry . in recent years our knowledge on ( some parts of )",
    "the qcd phase diagram has increased noticeably because of significant developments of the lattice qcd simulations ( see  @xcite for several examples and see also references therein ) . at zero @xmath2 , except for some reports  @xcite , the numerical simulations have almost established that two qcd phase transitions ( crossovers ) take place simultaneously at nearly the same temperature ; one for quark deconfinement and another for restoration of chiral symmetry ( the latter being always broken because of finite bare quark masses , strictly speaking ) .",
    "it is still however under debate whether two crossovers should occur at exactly the same temperature , however .",
    "once a finite @xmath2 is turned on , the monte - carlo simulation in three - color qcd on the lattice can not be performed straightforwardly because of the ( in)famous sign problem  @xcite . to overcome this problem several techniques",
    "have been developed such as the multi - parameter reweighting method  @xcite , taylor expansion  @xcite , density of state method  @xcite , analytical continuation from the imaginary chemical potential  @xcite , the complex langevin dynamics  @xcite , etc .",
    "in addition to hot and dense qcd with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the effect of a strong magnetic field @xmath3 on the qcd vacuum structure is also a very interesting subject .",
    "it would be of academic interest to speculate modification of the vacuum structure of a non - abelian quantum field theory under strong external fields . besides , more importantly , this kind of investigation has realistic relevance to phenomenology in relativistic heavy - ion collisions in which a strong magnetic field is produced in non - central collisions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the results obtained by the urqmd model  @xcite show that @xmath4 created in non - central au - au collisions can be as large as @xmath5 ( i.e.  @xmath6gauss ) for the top collision energy at rhic , namely @xmath7  gev .",
    "moreover , an estimate with the energy reachable at lhc , @xmath8  tev , gives @xmath9 for the pb - pb collision according to ref .",
    "@xcite . hence",
    ", heavy - ion collisions provide us with a most intriguing laboratory available on the earth in order to study the effect of extremely strong magnetic fields on the qcd vacuum .    concerning the ( electromagnetic ) magnetic field effect on the qcd vacuum structure ,",
    "there have been many investigations and it has been recognized that @xmath3 plays a role as a catalyzer of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the qcd vacuum properties have been also studied by means of so - called holographic qcd models  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the dynamics of qcd in a strong magnetic field and non - commutative field theories is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a phenomenologically interesting consequence from the strong @xmath3 in heavy - ion collisions is what is termed the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  @xcite .",
    "the underlying physics of the cme is the axial anomaly and topological objects in qcd .",
    "analytical and numerical investigations have demonstrated that the sphaleron transition occurs at a copious rate at high temperature unlike instantons that are thermally suppressed  @xcite .",
    "sphalerons are finite - energy solutions of the minkowskian equations of motion in the pure gauge sector and they appear not only in the electroweak theory but also in qcd  @xcite . they carry a finite winding number @xmath10 which is defined as @xmath11 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote respectively the field strength tensor and its dual .",
    "sphalerons connect two distinct classical vacua of the theory with different chern - simons numbers in minkowskian space - time .",
    "it is possible through the coupling with fermions in the theory to relate the change of chirality , @xmath14 , to the winding number by virtue of the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly relation , @xmath15 the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "is the integral over space - time of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the anomalous flavor - singlet axial current . the physical picture that arises from eq .",
    "is that in the presence of topological excitations such as instantons and sphalerons with a given @xmath10 , and starting with a system of quarks with @xmath18 , an unbalance between left - handed and right - handed quarks is produced .",
    "such an unbalance can lead to observable effects to probe topological @xmath19- and @xmath20-odd excitations .",
    "an experimental observable sensitive to local @xmath19- and @xmath20-odd effects has been proposed in ref .",
    "recently the star collaboration presented the conclusive observation of charge azimuthal correlations  @xcite possibly resulting from the cme with local @xmath19- and @xmath20-violation .    the intuitive picture of the cme is as follows .",
    "in a strong magnetic field @xmath3 , quarks are polarized along the direction of @xmath3 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath3 is along the positive @xmath21 axis ( that is conventionally taken as the @xmath22 axis in the context of heavy - ion collisions ) .",
    "neglecting quark masses , which is a good approximation for @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks in the high-@xmath1 chiral restored phase , the chirality is an eigenvalue to label the quarks .",
    "then , right - handed @xmath23 quarks should have both their spin and momentum parallel to @xmath3 and left - handed @xmath23 quarks should have their spin parallel to @xmath3 and momentum anti - parallel to @xmath3 .",
    "obviously the same reasoning applies to @xmath24 quarks . if @xmath18 , then the current that would originate from the motion of left - handed quarks is exactly cancelled by that of right - handed quarks .",
    "if @xmath25 which is expected from the anomaly relation  , on the other hand , a finite net current is produced .",
    "therefore , if quarks experience a strong magnetic field in a domain where the topological transition occurs , a net current is produced locally .",
    "the cme has been investigated in the chiral effective model  @xcite as well as in the holographic qcd model  @xcite .",
    "the chiral magnetic conductivity is calculated without gluon interactions in ref .",
    "@xcite . in  @xcite the electric - current susceptibility under a homogeneous magnetic field , which can be related to the fluctuation of the electric - charge asymmetry measured by the star collaboration , has been computed in the same way .",
    "the first lattice - qcd study of the cme has been performed by the itep lattice group  @xcite in the color-@xmath26 quench approximation . moreover",
    ", the connecticut group  @xcite performed a lattice - qcd study of the cme with @xmath27 dynamical quark flavors .",
    "this article is devoted to the study of the two - flavor nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio model with the polyakov loop coupling ( pnjl model ) in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the pnjl model has been introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite to incorporate deconfinement physics into the njl model  @xcite .",
    "the main addition to the njl model is a background gluon field in the euclidean temporal direction .",
    "the background field is related to the expectation value of the traced polyakov loop , @xmath28 , which is known to be an order parameter for the deconfinement transition in a pure gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "there are many theoretical studies related to different aspects of the pnjl model ; see for example ref .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a related study within the polyakov - quark - meson model , and  @xcite for an investigation within qcd with imaginary chemical potential .",
    "we work in the chiral limit throughout the paper , in which the definition of the chiral critical temperature has no ambiguity .",
    "firstly we focus on the effect of @xmath3 on chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature . as it will be clear soon ,",
    "our results support the role of the external @xmath3 as a catalyzer of dynamical symmetry breaking ; the critical temperature increases with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "naturally the ( pseudo)critical temperature for deconfinement crossover is less sensitive to the presence of @xmath3 because there is no direct coupling between photons and gluons .",
    "hence , the pnjl model predicts that at large enough @xmath3 , a substantial range of temperature will open at which quark matter is deconfined but chiral symmetry is still dynamically broken .",
    "see  @xcite for a related study .",
    "also we shall discuss the effects of a finite chiral chemical potential @xmath0 on the phase structure within the pnjl model .",
    "this @xmath0 mimics the topologically induced changes in chirality charges @xmath29 that are naturally expected by the qcd anomaly relation .",
    "the relevant quantity in a microscopic picture is rather the total chirality charge @xmath30 but for technical reasons it is easier to work in the grand - canonical ensemble by treating @xmath0 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative description based on the flux - tube picture ) , which is to be interpreted as the time derivative of the @xmath31 angle of the strong interactions ; @xmath32 .",
    "besides the phase diagram from the pnjl model , we compute quantities that are relevant to the cme , namely , the induced electric current density , its susceptibility , and the chiral charge density @xmath33 together with its susceptibility .    this paper is organized as follows ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we give a detailed description of the model we are using . in secs .  [ sec : phase ] and [ sec : cme ] we present and discuss our numerical results from the model . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we analyze the interplay between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement crossover at large @xmath3 using the pnjl model . here",
    "we consider two - flavor quark matter in the chiral limit since the chiral phase transition is a true phase transition only in the chiral limit , and then and only then @xmath34 can be identified unambiguously by vanishing chiral condensate .",
    "the chiral limit in the two - flavor sector is not far from the physical world in which the current quark masses are a few mev , almost negligible as compared to the temperature .",
    "moreover , we are interested in studying the situation in the presence of chirality charge density . in the grand - canonical ensemble",
    "we can introduce the chirality charge by virtue of the associated chemical potential @xmath0 in the following way .",
    "the lagrangian density of the model we consider is given by @xmath35    - \\mathcal{u}[\\phi,\\bar\\phi , t ] \\ ; , \\label{eq : four - fermi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the covariant derivative embeds the quark coupling to the external magnetic field and to the background gluon field as well , as we will see explicitly below .",
    "we note that @xmath0 couples to the chiral density operator @xmath36 , hence @xmath37 can develop when @xmath38 .",

    "we assume a homogeneous magnetic field , @xmath3 , along the positive @xmath21 axis .",

    "the thermodynamic al potential @xmath57 in the mean - field approximation in the presence of an abelian chromomagnetic field has been considered in many literatures , ref .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "the expression for an electromagnetic @xmath3 can be obtained in the same way .",
    "here we simply write the final result ; @xmath58 here the above definition of @xmath57 is different from the standard grand potential in thermodynamics by a volume factor @xmath59 . the quasi - particle dispersion @xmath60 is given by eq .  .",
    "the spin degeneracy factor is @xmath61 before going ahead further , one may wonder why we introduce only one order parameter for the chiral symmetry breaking even though the magnetic field breaks isospin symmetry . since @xmath62 , one could suspect that the effects of @xmath3 on @xmath63 and on @xmath64 are different .",
    "this is not the case , however , in the present model in the mean - field approximation . as a matter of fact , even in the presence of @xmath65 , the thermodynamic",
    "potential   depends only on @xmath66 .",
    "this is so only when the four - fermion interaction is eq .   with equal mixing of the @xmath67-symmetric and @xmath67-breaking terms .",
    "hence , the relevant quantity for the chiral symmetry breaking is just one condensate , namely @xmath68 , even for @xmath69 , and there is no need to introduce two independent condensates in this special case .",
    "even when we consider more general four - fermion interaction , the isospin breaking effect is only negligibly small .",
    "the vacuum part of the thermodynamic potential , @xmath70 , is ultraviolet divergent .",
    "this divergence is transmitted to the gap equations .",
    "thus we must specify a scheme to regularize this divergence .",
    "the choice of the regularization scheme is a part of the model definition and , nevertheless , the physically meaningful results should not depend on the regulator eventually . in the case with a strong magnetic field",
    "the sharp momentum cutoff suffers from cutoff artifact since the continuum momentum is replaced by the discrete landau quantized one . to avoid cutoff artifact ,",
    "in this work , we use a smooth regularization procedure by introducing a form factor @xmath71 in the diverging zero - point energy .",
    "our choice of @xmath71 is as follows ; @xmath72 where we specifically choose @xmath73 .",
    "in the @xmath74 limit the above @xmath71 is reduced to the sharp cutoff function @xmath75 .",
    "since the thermal part of @xmath57 is not divergent , we do not need to introduce a regularization function .",
    "in this section we firstly focus on the system at @xmath76 and discuss the role of the magnetic field as a catalyzer of the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we also analyze the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement crossover as the strength of @xmath3 increases .",
    "we analyze , within the pnjl model , the response of quark matter to @xmath3 at @xmath77 .",
    "in particular we are interested in the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement crossover in the presence of a magnetic field which leads to the so - called chiral magnetic catalysis  @xcite .",
    "our model parameter set is @xmath78 these parameters correspond to @xmath79 and the vacuum chiral condensate @xmath80 , and the constituent quark mass @xmath81 .",
    "the critical temperature for chiral restoration in the njl part at @xmath82 is @xmath83 .",

    "figure  [ figs ] is interesting for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the role of @xmath3 as a catalyzer of chiral symmetry breaking is evident .",
    "indeed , the chiral condensate and thus constituent quark mass increase in the whole @xmath1 region as @xmath4 is raised ( for graphical reasons , we have plotted our results starting from @xmath92 .",
    "there is nevertheless no significant numerical difference between the @xmath93 and @xmath92 results ) .",
    "this behavior is in the correct direction consistent with the well - known magnetic catalysis revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite and also discussed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite in a slightly different context of the pnjl - model study on the response of quark matter to external chromomagnetic fields .",
    "secondly , we observe that the deconfinement crossover is only marginally affected by the magnetic field .",
    "we can identify the deconfinement @xmath34 by the inflection point of @xmath28 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this simple procedure gives results nearly in agreement with those obtained by the peak position in the polyakov loop susceptibility , which is a common prescription to locate the so - called pseudo - critical temperature .",
    "also we can identify the deconfinement @xmath34 with the temperature at which @xmath94 .",
    "we note that @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ figs ] is the chiral @xmath88 where the chiral condensate vanishes , but not the deconfinement @xmath34 in both figures .    from fig .",
    "[ figs ] we notice that , increasing @xmath4 from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , the shift of the chiral transition temperature @xmath97 , while the shift of the deconfinement crossover temperature is as small as @xmath98 .",
    "hence , the chiral phase transition is more easily influenced by the magnetic field than the deconfinement as anticipated .",
    "consequently , under a strong magnetic field , there opens a substantially wide @xmath1-window in which quarks are deconfined but chiral symmetry is still spontaneously broken .",
    "this result , valid for @xmath99 , does not necessarily hold , in general , for @xmath100 , as we will see in the next subsection .",
    "+       we next turn to the study of the effect of a finite @xmath0 on the qcd phase transitions using the pnjl model .",
    "we recall that @xmath0 can not be a true chemical potential since its conjugate variable @xmath33 is only approximately conserved due to axial anomaly .",
    "nevertheless , because the time derivative of the strong @xmath31 angle translates into @xmath0 , as explained in the introduction section , @xmath0 itself is a physically meaningful quantity .",
    "we specifically look into the behavior of the critical line for chiral symmetry restoration , which is well defined in the chiral limit , at differing @xmath3 while keeping @xmath0 fixed",
    ". this study will be useful , among other things , in order to understand the relation between the chirality density @xmath33 and @xmath0 that we compute numerically in later discussions .",
    "one effect of @xmath38 is lowering of the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition .",
    "this is evident from the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "firstly we discuss the case of @xmath101 corresponding to the left upper and left lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "we see that increasing @xmath0 at low @xmath1 results in slight enhancement of the chiral condensate . as @xmath1 approaches @xmath34",
    ", however , the chiral phase transition at larger @xmath0 takes earlier place below @xmath34 . as a result of the coupling between the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop , the deconfinement crossover as shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] is also shifted earlier as @xmath0 becomes greater .    in view of the right upper and right lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] for large @xmath102 the @xmath0-effect on the chiral condensate at low @xmath1 is less visible .",
    "this is understood from the fact that the chiral magnetic catalysis effect is predominant over the minor enhancement due to @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , as @xmath1 is increased toward @xmath34 , the qualitative behavior of the shift in the critical temperature is just the same as what we have seen previously for @xmath103 .",
    "an interesting prediction from the pnjl model is that , at a given value of @xmath4 , there exists a critical @xmath0 , above which the chiral phase transition becomes first order . in the case @xmath103 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] the critical @xmath0 is found between @xmath104 . as a matter of fact , at @xmath105 , the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop both exhibit discontinuity at the critical temperature .",
    "we see that , as compared to the @xmath106 case , the slopes of the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop sharply change as a function of @xmath1 for the @xmath107 case . hence , our data plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] suggest the existence of a critical @xmath0 in the range @xmath108 at which the weakly first - order transition becomes a true second - order one .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane has a tricritical point ( tcp ) accordingly .",
    "we will discuss more on the tcp in the next subsection .",
    "we notice that this picture is qualitatively robust regardless of the chosen value of @xmath4 , as is already implied from fig .",
    "[ fig : masses ] .",
    "the first - order phase transition in the high-@xmath109 and low @xmath1 region leads to a discontinuity in the chirality density as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this point will be also addressed in some details in the next section .",
    "as a final remark in this subsection we note that , in figs .  [ figs ] and [ fig : masses ] , the slope of the curve quickly changes at some point ( at @xmath110 for @xmath111 for example ) .",
    "this is because of the second - order phase transition which is the case for chiral restoration in the chiral limit .",

    ", @xmath116 is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath4 as expected naively . when @xmath4 reaches a critical value around @xmath96 , however , @xmath116 has a pronounced peak and then decreases with increasing @xmath4 , which is a result of mixture with diverging chiral susceptibility at the chiral phase transition",
    ". it should be mentioned that @xmath116 at @xmath76 ( as shown in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : susc02 ] ) does not diverge at the critical @xmath4 since the mixing with the chiral susceptibility is vanishing due to @xmath76 .",
    "this behavior below and above the chiral critical point can be easily understood in terms of the chiral symmetry breaking by virtue of the magnetic field . as",
    "a matter of fact , at @xmath131 the chiral condensate stays zero identically as long as @xmath4 is small enough , leading to zero quasiparticle masses .",
    "once @xmath4 exceeds a critical value , the chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously even at high @xmath1 ( see the upper right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : susc02 ] ) and the quasiparticle masses can then jump to a substantially large number then .",
    "such dynamical quark masses result in appreciable suppression of the chirality - charge fluctuations .",
    "as it will be shown in the next section , this interesting and intuitively understandable effect appears in the current susceptibility as well .",
    "the current density @xmath117 ( and its susceptibility as well ) is the most important quantity to compute for the chiral magnetic effect  @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to the charge per unit volume that moves in the direction of the applied magnetic field in a domain where an instanton / sphaleron transition takes place , which causes chirality change of quarks .",
    "the current has been computed analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite in four different ways .    to compute the current density along the magnetic field , i.e.@xmath132",
    ", we follow the common procedure to add an external homogeneous vector potential along the magnetic field , @xmath133 , coupled to the fermion field",
    ". then , @xmath134 the derivative of the thermodynamic potential in the presence of a background field is computed in the following way .",
    "the coupling of quarks to @xmath133 is achieved by shifting @xmath135 in eq .   as @xmath136 . after putting regularization in the momentum integral with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath129 ( we know that the current is ultraviolet finite , hence the choice of the regularization method does not affect the final result ) we change the order of the momentum integral and the derivative with respect to @xmath133 .",
    "then we make use of the following replacement , @xmath137 to obtain , @xmath138 \\;.\\ ] ] the ellipsis represents irrelevant matter terms . after summing over the spin @xmath139 ,",
    "the contribution of the integrand from the landau levels with @xmath140 turns out to be an odd function of @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , only the lowest landau level gives a non - vanishing contribution to the current and we get from the surface contribution  @xcite , @xmath141 which is certainly ultraviolet finite as it should be .",
    "generally speaking we should utilize a gauge - invariant regularization .",
    "nevertheless the above indicates that a naive momentum cutoff can reproduce a correct expression for the anomalous chiral magnetic current .    the current density as given by eq .",
    "does not depend on quark mass explicitly , and on temperature either .",
    "the reason is that the current is generated by the axial anomaly and it receives contributions only from the ultraviolet momentum regions ( as the above derivation shows ) , and so it is insensitive to any infrared energy scales .",
    "also , the polyakov loop does not appear explicitly in eq .  .",
    "this is easy to understand ; the polyakov loop is a thermal coupling between quark excitations and the gluonic medium , and thus the polyakov loop only enters the thermal part of @xmath57 .",
    "since the current originates from the anomaly , however , the thermal part of @xmath57 just drops off for the current generation .",
