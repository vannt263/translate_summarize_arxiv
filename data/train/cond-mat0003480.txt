    "scaling and criticality in nonequilibrium systems continue to be of great interest in statistical physics . among the various classes of systems that have been subject to intensive study are models of growing interfaces @xcite , and absorbing - state phase transitions , typified by directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite .",
    "absorbing - state phase transitions have been linked to self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite , as have driven interface models @xcite .",
    "the latter connection is established by defining a height variable @xmath3 at each site of a sandpile model ; at each time interval , the height increases by one unit at each active ( toppling ) site .",
    "it turns out that the interface of the bak - tang - wiesenfeld model @xcite is described by an edwards - wilkinson equation with columnar noise @xcite . in view of the connections between absorbing - state phase transitions , soc , and surface growth , it is of interest to study the dynamics of the interface representation of a simple model in the dp class .",
    "precise results on the scaling properties of the dp interface representation should prove useful when trying to assign interface models ( or height representations of other models , such as sandpiles ) to universality classes .    in this paper",
    "we examine the dynamics of the contact process in dimensions 1 - 3 , studying the interface width and the height - height correlation function , as well as the height probability distribution . in sec .",
    "ii we define the model and then present a brief discussion of the associated continuum equation , and of a scaling theory .",
    "numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "iv contains a brief summary .",
    "the contact process ( cp ) is a simple particle system ( lattice markov process ) exhibiting a phase transition to an absorbing ( frozen ) state at a critical value of the creation rate @xcite .",
    "this model belongs to the universality class of directed percolation @xcite and reggeon field theory @xcite , and is pertinent to models of epidemics @xcite , catalysis @xcite , and damage spreading @xcite , among many others . in the cp",
    "each site of the hypercubic lattice @xmath4 is either vacant or occupied by a particle .",
    "particles are created at vacant sites at rate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the number of occupied nearest - neighbors , and are annihilated at unit rate , independent of the surrounding configuration .",
    "the order parameter is the particle density @xmath7 ; the vacuum state , @xmath8 , is absorbing .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased beyond @xmath10 , there is a continuous phase transition from the vacuum to an active state ; for @xmath11 , @xmath12 in the stationary state . in one dimension , @xmath13 .",
    "there are a number of ways ( equivalent as regards scaling behavior ) , of implementing the cp in a simulation algorithm ; this work follows the widely used practice of maintaining a list of all occupied sites . in this",
    "study the initial condition is always that of all sites occupied .",
    "subsequent events involve selecting ( at random ) an occupied site * x * from the @xmath14 sites on the list , selecting a process : creation with probability @xmath15 , annihilation with probability @xmath16 , and , in the case of creation , selecting one of the @xmath17 nearest neighbors , * y * , of * x*. ( the creation attempt succeeds if * y * is vacant ) .",
    "the time increment @xmath18 associated with an event is @xmath19 , where @xmath14 is the number of occupied sites immediately prior to the event .",
    "a trial ends when all the particles have vanished , or at the first event with time @xmath20 , a preset maximum time .",
    "the important scaling laws pertinent to the critical contact process on a lattice of @xmath21 sites , starting with all sites occupied are : ( 1 ) the mean survival time @xmath22 , and ( 2 ) the average particle density decays as a power law , @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "( in practice , the power law is found already for @xmath25 . ) in one dimension , @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "occupied sites represent activity , which spreads from site to site .",
    "( the absence of any activity corresponds to the absorbing state . ) in a growing surface or driven interface , activity corresponds to the motion of the interface .",
    "we therefore define the _ height _ @xmath3 at site @xmath28 as the amount of time ( up to time @xmath29 ) that site @xmath28 has been occupied . in our numerical studies we use a real - valued height ( recall that time is not restricted to integer values in our implementation ) . by keeping a record of the last time @xmath30 at which the state of site @xmath28 changed , we are able to evaluate @xmath3 at any moment in the simulation .",
    "( while the results reported here are for real @xmath31 , we find the same scaling properties for integer @xmath31 . )",
    "the surface @xmath3 may be thought of as a driven interface . since the critical contact process must eventually enter the absorbing state , the interface , in this analogy , will eventually be pinned .",
    "the large - scale properties of the cp and related models such as dp can be described via a field theory ( so - called reggeon field theory ) framed in terms of a coarse - grained density @xmath32 @xcite . retaining only relevant terms ,",
    "the stochastic pde for @xmath33 reads @xmath34    here @xmath35 is a gaussian noise with zero mean and autocorrelation    @xmath36    in our continuum description , the height is given by    @xmath37    integrating eq .",
    "( [ cpft ] ) from time zero to time @xmath29 , we obtain    @xmath38    with the noise autocorrelation    @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "thus the equation governing the height includes a nonlinear memory term and a noise with nonvanishing correlations between different times .",
    "this equation does not seem to shed much light on the scaling properties of the interface .",
    "rather , the relation between @xmath31 and the density in the contact process , eq . ( [ htcont ] ) , yields some properties that are not immediately obvious from eq .",
    "( [ hft ] ) , for example , that @xmath41 , and that the nonlinear term is relevant for @xmath42 . in any event ,",
    "( [ hft ] ) does serve to point up some differences between the cp interface and conventional surface - growth models such as the edwards - wilkinson @xcite or kardar - parisi - zhang equations @xcite .",
    "first , the linear  drive \" term ( @xmath43 with @xmath44 in the active regime ) is proportional to the local height and so can not be transformed away .",
    "second , in the active state , the moduli of the last three terms on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ hft ] ) grow without limit , suggesting that @xmath45 does as well , so that the width of the active phase never saturates .",
    "we turn now to a simple scaling analysis of the interface . at its basis",
    "lies a scaling hypothesis for the probability density @xmath46 of the height @xmath31 ( at any lattice site ) at time @xmath29 : the time - dependence of this density enters only through the _ mean height _ @xmath47 .",
    "the conjectured scaling property is    @xmath48    where the scaling function @xmath49 with @xmath50 , and the prefactor guarantees normalization .",
    "it follows that the moments of @xmath31 all scale with the mean height , @xmath51^n$ ] with @xmath52 the @xmath6-th moment @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , the mean - square width    @xmath54 ^ 2 \\ ; , \\label{scw2}\\ ] ]    if eq .",
    "( [ schyp ] ) holds . on the other hand",
    ", we have that for times @xmath55 in the critical contact process ,    @xmath56    which immediately implies that @xmath57 with @xmath0 .    in surface growth studies the crossover time is expected to scale as @xmath58 ; for a process in the dp universality class , we may write @xmath59 ( clearly @xmath60 and @xmath61 should scale with the same exponent ) . then the roughness exponent @xmath62 , defined via @xmath63 for @xmath64 ,",
    "is given by the scaling relation @xmath65 .",
    "it is perhaps worth stressing that the expressions relating @xmath62 and @xmath1 to dp exponents depend on the validity of the scaling hypothesis , eq .",
    "( [ schyp ] ) , which should be tested . inserting the known dp exponent values , scaling theory yields @xmath66 , 0.97 , 0.51 , and zero for dimensions 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the interface associated with the critical contact process is super - rough in one dimension , and asymptotically flat in @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the family of height - difference correlation functions    @xmath69    are also much studied in surface growth processes . starting with a flat interface at @xmath70",
    ", we expect power - law growth , @xmath71 , for @xmath72 , the time - dependent correlation length .",
    "if @xmath73 depends on @xmath74 the interface is said to be multi - affine . for @xmath75 , @xmath76 will saturate ; in particular , @xmath77 should approach @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath81 is the only length - scale relevant to correlations at short times ( i.e. , for @xmath82 , so that the system size @xmath83 does not come into play ) , it is reasonable to expect the scaling form    @xmath84    where the scaling function @xmath85 for small @xmath86 and is constant for large @xmath86 . the case @xmath87 is referred to as  conventional \" scaling while @xmath88 is characterized as  anomalous \" scaling @xcite .",
    "we determined the square width @xmath89 for rings of @xmath90 , 1000 , 2000 , and 5000 sites , in samples of 2000 , 1000 , 1000 , and 400 trials , respectively .",
    "the maximum time ranged from about @xmath91 for @xmath92 to @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "all simulations were performed at the critical point , @xmath13 . in the contact process , interfacial properties can be studied over the full sample , or over a sample restricted to those trials that survive to time @xmath29 .",
    "when a trial enters the absorbing state , @xmath95 naturally remains fixed for all subsequent times , and since all trials do eventually reach the absorbing state in the critical contact process , the interface width saturates for large @xmath29 .",
    "if we restrict the sample to surviving trials , however , there is no saturation .",
    "it is important to note that the same scaling laws apply in either case .",
    "( the power - law growth regime , for example , corresponds to times @xmath96 , for which all trials still survive . )",
    "1 shows a series of snapshots of the interface in a single trial with @xmath97 , at intervals of 5000 time units .",
    "the progressive roughening of the interface , without evidence of saturation , is apparent .",
    "2 is a scaling plot of the square width , averaged over all trials , i.e. , @xmath98 versus @xmath99 , using the exponents @xmath100 and @xmath101 expected for dp in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "there is a near - perfect data collapse for @xmath102 .",
    "the power - law portion of the graph ( @xmath103 ) yields the growth exponent @xmath104 , in good agreement with the value @xmath105 expected on the basis of the scaling argument .",
    "( figures in parentheses denote statistical uncertainties . ) analysis of the saturation width yields @xmath106 with @xmath107 .    in fig .",
    "3 we test the scaling assumption for the height probability distribution @xmath108 by plotting @xmath109 versus @xmath110 .",
    "( recall that @xmath111 is expected to grow @xmath112 . ) in this system of @xmath113 sites , there is a near - perfect data collapse , in accord with eq .",
    "( [ schyp ] ) , for times between 500 and @xmath114 . for @xmath115",
    "we begin to note a departure from scaling , which becomes more pronounced at later times .",
    "note that @xmath116 corresponds to @xmath117 , which is where @xmath95 begins to depart noticeably from a power law in fig .",
    "2 . analysis of @xmath108 for @xmath94 yields similar results .",
    "the form of the scaling function for a given reduced time @xmath118 is independent of the system size , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , which compares height probability distributions for systems of 1000 and 5000 sites at times corresponding to the same @xmath118 .",
    "the height - height correlation function @xmath77 in a system of 1000 sites is shown in fig .",
    "5 , which is a double - logarithmic plot of @xmath119 versus @xmath120 .",
    "there is a perfect data collapse for @xmath29 = 500, ...",
    ",@xmath114 ( reduced times @xmath121 ) , with a power - law portion @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "at later times @xmath124 does not collapse , principally because the square width has begun to saturate ( it no longer grows @xmath125 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath126 is insensitive to system size .",
    "for @xmath94 we obtain @xmath127 for @xmath128 , and 0.644 for @xmath129 .",
    "thus we may , with a high degree of confidence , adopt the estimate @xmath130 , clearly much smaller than the roughness exponent @xmath131 found in the analysis of the square width , indicating that this one - dimensional system exhibits anomalous scaling .",
    "recently , lpez argued that anomalous surface roughening is associated with a diverging height gradient @xcite . in view of the growing spikes evident in the profiles shown in fig .",
    "1 , this association seems very probable in the present instance .",
    "indeed , the mean - square height gradient    @xmath132    diverges as a power law ( see fig .",
    "we find @xmath133 , with @xmath134 for @xmath113 , @xmath135 for @xmath136 , and 0.4337(4 ) for @xmath94 ; we adopt @xmath137 as our best estimate . from lpez analysis ,",
    "one expects    @xmath138    inserting our result for @xmath139 and the dp values @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the r.h.s . , we obtain @xmath142 , in good agreement with the result found from analysis of the correlation function",
    ".    we also studied the generalized height - height correlation function @xmath76 , eq .",
    "( [ corrfct ] ) , for @xmath74 = 1/2 , 1 , 3/2 , 2 and 3 , in a system with @xmath113 , at @xmath143 , and found that the functions @xmath144^{1/q}$ ] are identical , and give @xmath145 .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the dp interface is self - affine not multi - affine .    in two dimensions we studied systems of up to 256@xmath146256 sites at the critical point , @xmath147 .",
    "the curves for @xmath95 again show a good collapse ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , and the derived exponents are in very good agreement with the expected values .",
    "specifically , we find @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "scaling relations combined with known dp exponent values yield @xmath151 and @xmath152 , while current best estimates give @xmath153 for dp in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .    for smaller system sizes",
    "we observe a transient in @xmath95 and all other measured quantities , which does not appear in one dimension .",
    "anomalous roughening is also seen in two and three dimensions .",
    "fig . 8 shows @xmath154 growing @xmath155 with @xmath156 .",
    "the height - height correlation function exhibits a good collapse , as shown in fig .",
    "9 ; the initial power - law growth yields @xmath157 ; thus the scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ lopezsc ] ) is well satisfied : @xmath158 .",
    "we determined the interface exponents in three dimensions ( @xmath159 , system size @xmath160 sites , maximum time 10@xmath161 ) , though to somewhat lower precision , owing to the larger computational demand .",
    "the scaling relation yields @xmath162 , while our simulation results for @xmath95 give @xmath163 . in three dimensions",
    "we find @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "together with eq .",
    "( [ lopezsc ] ) , these yield @xmath167 .",
    "our results for critical exponents are collected in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "defining an interface representation for the contact process by analogy with similar representations for sandpile models , we verified the expected scaling relation @xmath0 in dimensions 1 - 3 , and the scaling property of the height probability distribution in one dimension . the local roughness exponent , @xmath126 , is smaller than the global value , @xmath62 , indicating anomalous surface growth .",
    "this anomalous scaling is attended by a diverging local slope , @xmath168 .",
    "our results for @xmath139 are consistent with the scaling relation eq .",
    "( [ lopezsc ] ) derived by lpez .",
    "there is , on the other hand , no evidence of multi - affinity in this process .",
    "an interesting point is that the process continues to exhibit anomalous scaling for @xmath169 and 3 , even though @xmath170 in these cases .",
    "while it was pointed out some time ago that @xmath171 implies anomalous growth @xcite , the latter appears to be an intrinsic feature of the contact process ( and , by extension , of other models in the dp universality class ) below @xmath172 .",
    "finally , we note that the anomalous roughening analysis introduces two new critical exponents , @xmath126 and @xmath139 , and only one new scaling relation between them .",
    "we therefore have a new independent exponent , @xmath139 for instance , that is not related to the standard dp exponents in any way .",
    "a very interesting theoretical task is that of computing @xmath139 in an epsilon expansion around the upper critical dimension @xmath173 .",
    "our guess is that this new anomalous exponent is related to the renormalization of a composite operator not consider so far in the analysis of the reggeon field theory , but this issue is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be studied elsewhere .",
