    "the conjectures on @xmath0-gorenstein surface singularities with rational homology sphere link fit in the wider framework of the following question .    which discrete data are needed to know a normal surface singularity ?",
    "one interpretation of ` knowing a singularity ' is that we can write down equations .",
    "as we only have discrete data , such equations necessarily describe a family of equisingular surfaces . at",
    "the very least one should know the geometric genus of the singularity , the most basic analytical invariant , which is constant in equisingular families ( this requirement excludes the multiplicity ) .",
    "the first thing needed is the topology of the singularity , or what amounts to the same , the resolution graph .",
    "let @xmath32 be any resolution of a normal surface singularity @xmath33 with exceptional set @xmath34 .",
    "the intersection form @xmath35 is a negative definite quadratic form .",
    "it can be coded by a weighted graph , with vertices @xmath36 corresponding to the irreducible components @xmath37 of the exceptional set with weight @xmath38 ; two vertices are joined by an edge , if the corresponding components intersect , with edge weight the intersection number . the numerical class @xmath39 of the canonical bundle of @xmath40 provides a characteristic vector : by the adjunction formula we have @xmath41 .",
    "the resolution graph of @xmath42 is the weighted graph obtained by giving the vertices as additional weight the arithmetical genus of the corresponding component , written in square brackets .",
    "it encodes all necessary information for the calculus of cycles on @xmath43 , but it carries no information on the singularities of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore one usually requires that all irreducible components are smooth and that they intersect transversally ; this is called a good resolution .",
    "all edge weights are then equal to 1 , and are not written . according to custom",
    "we also suppress the vertex weights @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 . by the resolution graph of a singularity we mean the graph of the minimal good resolution .    for rational singularities",
    "the resolution graph suffices to ` know ' the singularity , by a celebrated result of artin .",
    "by laufer and reid the same holds for minimally elliptic singularities . beyond these classes of singularities",
    "this is no longer true , as shown by the following example of laufer , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 6.3 ) ; it occurs on several places in @xcite , starting with 2.23 .",

    "let @xmath52 be the normal bundle of @xmath48 on the minimal resolution .",
    "one has @xmath53 , as divisor on @xmath48 .",
    "so by adjunction @xmath54 , if the singularity is gorenstein .    to compute @xmath55 one can use computation sequences for s.s .- t .",
    "yau s elliptic sequence ; a convenient reference is @xcite .",
    "starting from @xmath56 one considers in order the cycles @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "one looks at the long exact cohomology sequences of the short exact sequences connecting these cycles .",
    "the most relevant ones are @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62 one finds @xmath63 . moreover , if @xmath64 , the singularity is not gorenstein and @xmath65 . if @xmath54 , then @xmath66 , and @xmath67 if @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 both cases @xmath67 and @xmath70 are possible .    in the following we give equations for all cases . for double points @xmath71",
    "this can be done starting from the topological type of the branch curve , but in general it is very difficult to find equations .",
    "the easiest approach is to first compute generators of the local ring .",
    "this works for quasi - homogeneous singularities , where one can use pinkham s method @xcite . by computing deformations of positive",
    "weight one finds other singularities .",
    "as the graph is star - shaped , there exist quasi - homogeneous singularities with this graph .",
    "their coordinate ring is the graded ring @xmath72 .",
    "we may take the point @xmath73 as origin of the group law on the elliptic curve .",
    "the structure of the ring @xmath74 depends on the order of the point @xmath50 on the elliptic curve .      in this case",
    "the singularity is gorenstein by a result of s.s .- t .",
    "yau , see @xcite , and all singularities are deformations of the quasi - homogeneous ones .",
    "the weighted homogeneous ring @xmath74 has three generators , in degrees 1 , 6 and 9 .",
    "the whole equisingular stratum is given by @xmath77      a singularity of this type is still a deformation of a quasi - homogeneous singularity , but now a nonnormal one .",
    "the resolution specialises to the resolution of the quasi - homogeneous singularity and blowing down the exceptional set of the total space yields a family specialising to a nonnormal singularity with @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the normalisation of the local ring .",
    "an example of such a singularity is provided by the subring of @xmath81 generated by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in computing a deformation of positive weight of this singularity",
    "there is no guarantee that the computation stops , but with some luck we succeeded . for the deformed singularity",
    "two variables can be eliminated and the result of our computation is a determinantal singularity in @xmath88 , for which we give the equisingular stratum .",
    "this will contain most singularities of this type , but maybe not all .",
    "in new variables @xmath89 we get the equations @xmath90 checking that this singularity has indeed the required resolution graph can be done by embedded resolution , for which point blow - ups suffice .",
    "eliminating @xmath91 , i.e. , projecting onto the first three coordinates , gives the non - isolated hypersurface singularity @xmath92 the singular locus is given by @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 be the generator of the dualising sheaf .",
    "then @xmath95 and @xmath96 lift to regular differential forms on the normalisation .",
    "so indeed @xmath67 .",
    "this example is related to examples of okuma @xcite .",
    "every such singularity is a deformation of a quasi - homogenous one .",
    "generators of the weighted homogeneous ring have degree 2 , 3 and 7 .",
    "the equisingular stratum is @xmath99      here there are two moduli , one being the modulus of the elliptic curve , the other the class of the divisor @xmath101 in the jacobian of the curve .",
    "we start again from the quasi - homogeneous case .",
    "the dimension of the group @xmath102 is @xmath103 .",
    "we consider the plane cubic @xmath104 with inflexion point @xmath105 and inflexional tangent @xmath106 .",
    "a section of @xmath107 can be given by the rational function @xmath108 , where @xmath18 is the equation of the tangent line in the point @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath109 we take the function @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is a conic intersecting the the curve in @xmath73 with multiplicity 2 and in @xmath50 with multiplicity 3 . continuing in this way one gets generators of the local ring .",
    "we refrain from giving complicated general formulas .",
    "the formulas simplify if @xmath112 , but on the other hand the embedding dimension increases by one . following the principle of first describing the most special singularity we take for @xmath50 the inflexion point @xmath113 .",
    "the function @xmath114 is a section of @xmath107 and @xmath109 .",
    "we homogenise and write the sections as forms of degree @xmath115 . with this convention",
    "we find generators @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we need a generator in degree 9 , as @xmath122 .",
    "there are 10 equations , which can be written in _ rolling factors format _",
    "there are two deformations of positive weight , which respect this format ; in fact , they can be written as deformation of the equation : @xmath123 the equations consist of the six equations of a scroll : @xmath124 and four additional equations , obtained by multiplying the equation ( [ cuba ] ) with suitable factors .",
    "the transition from one equation to the next involves the replacement of one occurring entry of the top row of the matrix by the one standing below it . we get",
    "@xmath125 furthermore there is a deformation of degree 0 , corresponding to moving the point @xmath50 . it does not respect the rolling factors format ; as infinitesimal deformation we change the equation of degree 9 to @xmath126 , showing again that the embedding dimension drops for @xmath127",
    "we did not succeed in computing the higher order terms , which seem to involve power series . only for the special value @xmath128 of the modulus the computation ended after a finite number of steps .",
    "we give the result .",
    "@xmath129    similar examples exist with @xmath48 replaced by other minimally elliptic cycles , such as a chain of rational curves .",
    "but if @xmath48 is a rational cuspidal curve , there are no torsion points , as the group structure of a cuspidal cubic is that of the additive group @xmath130 , and there is only one possibility for a gorenstein singularity , the one with @xmath70 , giving the singularity @xmath131 ( in arnold s notation ) ; a quasihomogeneous equation is @xmath132 .",
    "the conjecture has been made that the geometric genus is topological , if one assumes a topological restriction , that the link of the singularity is a rational homology sphere , and an analytical one , that the singularity is @xmath0-gorenstein .",
    "in fact , nmethi and nicolaescu proposed a precise formula : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the seiberg - witten invariant of the link @xmath40 , as before @xmath39 is the canonical cycle and @xmath135 the number of components of the exceptional divisor ; for details see @xcite .    for smoothable gorenstein singularities",
    "this conjecture can be formulated in terms of the signature of the milnor fibre .",
    "we recall laufer s formula @xmath136 together with @xmath137 and @xmath138 we find durfee s signature formula @xmath139 so the conjecture is @xmath140 .",
    "this conjecture generalises the casson invariant conjecture of neumann and wahl @xcite , that for an complete intersection with integral homology sphere link @xmath141 equals the casson invariant .    as an outgrowth of their work neumann and wahl even came up with a way to write down equations from the resolution graph .",
    "what is known about it , is very well described in wahl s survey @xcite . in the case of",
    "a rational homology sphere link satisfying certain conditions one gets equations together with an action of the finite group @xmath142 . given a singularity @xmath33 with @xmath23 finite , the maximal unramified abelian cover of @xmath143 is a galois cover with covering transformation group @xmath23 , which can be completed with one point . we get a map @xmath144 , which is called the universal abelian cover of @xmath33 .",
    "the recipe for the equations involve the splice diagram of the singularity , see @xcite . here",
    "we recall only the case of a resolution graph of a quasi - homogeneous singularity , already given in @xcite .",
    "there is one central curve with @xmath115 arms , which are resolution graphs of cyclic quotient singularities with a group of order @xmath145 , @xmath146 .",
    "the associated @xmath147 equations define a brieskorn - pham complete intersection : one has linear equations in @xmath148 with general enough coefficient matrix .",
    "the group @xmath23 acts diagonally . in general these equations",
    "are the building blocks , which have to be spliced together , leading to splice type equations .",
    "this requires conditions on the graph , which are called the ` semigroup condition ' ( in order to be able to splice ) and the ` congruence condition ' ( to have an action of @xmath23 ) .",
    "the resulting singularity is said to be a splice quotient .",
    "a surface singularity @xmath10 is called superisolated if blowing up the origin once resolves the singularity .",

    "this singularity is a @xmath115-fold suspension singularity if and only if @xmath161 is a unit , so @xmath162 . to determine the embedded resolution it suffices to consider the singularity @xmath163 .",
    "the other singular points of @xmath12 can be treated in a similar way .    in particular , for a superisolated singularity",
    "the first blow up gives the minimal resolution .",

    "the link @xmath40 of the singularity is a rational homology sphere if @xmath22 is homeomorphic to @xmath168 ( we restrict ourselves to the case of irreducible curves ) .",
    "this implies that it is locally irreducible , so @xmath22 is an irreducible rational curve with only ( higher ) cusp singularities .",
