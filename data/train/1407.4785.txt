    "primordial gravitational waves ( gws ) are one of the most important probe of the very early universe and a lot of efforts have been made for this subject both in theoretical and observational aspects .",
    "in particular , the recent result of b - mode polarization in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from bicep2 @xcite that claimed the detection of the primordial gws has been stimulating a lot of research .",
    "although there have been some debate regarding the issue of the foreground subtraction in bicep2 @xcite , taking it at face value , the bicep2 result seems to be inconsistent with the temperature data from planck . from the analysis of planck+wmap 9-year polarization in the framework of the @xmath3cdm+tensor mode , the upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio",
    "@xmath4 has been given as @xmath5 ( 95  % c.l ) @xcite , while the recent bicep2 gives the bound @xmath6 ( 68 % c.l . )",
    "this tension motivates various works considering an extension of the standard cosmological model , one of which is a blue - tilted tensor spectrum @xcite .",
    "although the standard inflation model predicts a red - tilted spectrum since the tensor spectral index @xmath7 has the so - called consistency relation @xmath8 , a blue - tilted spectrum can be realized in some models , e.g , string gas cosmology @xcite , super - inflation models @xcite , g - inflation @xcite , non - commutative inflation @xcite , particle production during inflation @xcite , and so on .",
    "therefore , observational constraints on the blue - tilted tensor spectrum would be worth investigating also from the perspective of models of the early universe .    aside from the cmb",
    ", primordial gws could be also detected as a stochastic gw background and there are several observational constraints on the energy density of the stochastic gws at different gw frequencies : pulsar timing @xcite , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite , interferometric gw detectors such as ligo and virgo @xcite and so on   distortion @xcite , helioseismology @xcite , precision doppler tracking from the cassini spacecraft @xcite , orbital monitoring of binary systems @xcite , torsion - bar antennas @xcite , seismic spectrum from the earth @xcite , synchronous recycling interferometers @xcite , cross - correlation measurement between the explorer and nautilus cryogenic resonant bar detectors @xcite , and global positioning system ( gps ) satellite @xcite . ] .",
    "although these limits are far above the prediction of the standard inflationary models , a strongly blue - tilted tensor spectrum can easily be excluded by these constraints , which has been investigated in @xcite .    however , it should be noted that the thermal history of the universe affects the spectrum of the primordial gws @xcite .",
    "for instance , high - frequency primordial gws which entered the horizon during a matter - like component dominated epoch , such as that exists during reheating or late - time entropy production , have different frequency dependence compared to those which entered the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "this results in a suppression of the spectrum at high frequencies , whose range depends on when and how long it took place .",
    "it should also be noted that the above - mentioned generation mechanisms of gws do not necessarily predict a blue - tilted spectrum over all the frequencies .",
    "the spectral index of the primordial gw spectrum can change at some frequency . therefore , if we also take into account the spectral shapes caused by those effects , the constraint on @xmath7 changes depending on the underlying scenario of the early universe , which we are going to investigate in this paper .",
    "for this purpose , we use two different approaches to describe the gw spectrum .",
    "first , we consider constraints on @xmath7 taking into account the suppression of the spectrum at high frequencies due to reheating and late - time entropy production , assuming that the primordial spectrum has uniform spectral index over all frequencies . for this case",
    ", we use a fitting formula which can reproduce the effect of the thermal history on the spectrum with a very good accuracy .",
    "second , we consider the constraints on @xmath7 without assuming an explicit model of the early universe .",
    "since the shape of the gw spectrum strongly depends on the model assumed , we use a more general form of the spectrum such that the spectral index changes from @xmath7 to a different value at a given frequency .",
    "this modeling also includes the case where the universe is dominated by a component whose equation of state differs from that of radiation / matter component .",
    "although we assume that the transition is discontinuous , this method can approximately describe gw spectra in several scenarios of the early universe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we begin with a brief review of the formalism to calculate the gw spectrum , taking into account the effect of thermal history by using fitting functions . in section  [ sec : results ] , first we summarize current observational bounds on the amplitude of the gw to be used in providing an upper bound on @xmath7 . then we show how the constraints on @xmath7 change depending on the existence of reheating and late - time entropy production .",
    "subsequently , we provide constraints on @xmath7 under the general modeling .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion of this paper .",
    "here , we briefly summarize the formalism to calculate the spectrum of a stochastic gw background of primordial origin .",

    "the amplitude , @xmath36 , is usually characterized by the so - called tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 defined by @xmath37 and we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the power spectrum for the scalar perturbation and it is precisely measured as @xmath40 at @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the transfer function @xmath30 describes the evolution of gws after horizon crossing , which depends on the thermal history of the universe .",
    "this can be obtained by numerically solving the evolution equation of the gws : @xmath42 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to the conformal time . in the following subsections ,",
    "we provide fitting formulas which enable us to easily express the effects of thermal history with a few parameters .",
    "let us first consider the standard reheating scenario in which soon after inflation the universe has matter - dominated ( md ) like phase before the completion of reheating .",
    "such a phase is proceeded by the oscillation of inflaton field at the bottom of its quadratic potential .",

    "gws which enter the horizon during that phase have a spectral power dependence of @xmath172 therefore , when the background equation of state changes from @xmath171 to @xmath173 ( radiation ) at the temperature @xmath174 , one can describe the gw spectrum by assuming @xmath101 as @xmath175 and @xmath159 would be the quantity determined by @xmath174 .",
    "in addition , in some models predicting a blue - tilted gw spectrum , the generation mechanism of the primordial gws does not continuously generate a blue - tilted spectrum , and the spectral index changes from blue - tilted one to another .",
    "the general modeling is useful to describe such change of the spectral power dependence in the primordial spectrum @xmath176 .",
    "for example , if there exists some phase during inflation in which the production of the vector quanta becomes effective , for the modes which exit the horizon during such phase , the generated primordial gws can be blue - tilted @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the action such as @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the field strength of the gauge field and its dual , @xmath180 is a dynamical pseudo - scalar field and @xmath181 is a pseudo - scalar decay constant . through the coupling between the pseudo - scalar and gauge field , time dependent pseudo - scalar @xmath180 induces the production of the gauge quanta and this gauge quanta becomes the source of the gravitational waves .",
    "since the spectral tilt of the gravitational waves depends on the time evolution of the pseudo - scalar @xmath182 , the blue tensor spectrum can be realized by taking into account appropriate dynamics of @xmath180 . for the modes which cross the horizon after the production phase ( e.g.",
    ", @xmath180 stops the rolling ) , the gw spectrum is not blue - tilted anymore , and the amplitude of the primordial gws decreases at higher frequency . in a such case ,",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath159 represents the mode which exits the horizon at the end of the effective particle creation phase during inflation .",
    "then , the duration of the particle creation phase , measured from the time when the reference scale exit the horizon , can be expressed in terms of the @xmath183-folding number as @xmath184 where we assume that the hubble parameter during inflation stays almost constant .    to obtain an intuitive idea of this modeling and how the constraint on @xmath7 depends on the value of @xmath101 and @xmath161 ( or @xmath159 ) , we show the gw spectrum represented by eq .   in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_general ] . in this figure , we show three examples of gw spectrum considering different scenarios of the early universe . the green dashed spectrum corresponds to a blue - tilted primordial spectrum , @xmath185 , which underwent the standard reheating scenario with @xmath186  gev .",
    "the blue dotted one describes a scale - invariant primordial spectrum which has experienced a kination - dominated phase after inflation . for the red solid one",
    ", we consider a primordial spectrum such that the model predicts a strongly blue - tilted spectrum of @xmath187 around the cmb scale , but at some later stage , the situation become the same as the standard slow - roll inflation .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : general_const ] , the upper bound on @xmath7 is shown as a contour plot in the @xmath159@xmath101 plane for each observation , i.e. , ligo , pulsar timing and bbn .",
    "once we know an approximated form of the gw spectrum for some particular model , we can find the values of @xmath101 and @xmath159 for that model and read off the upper bound on @xmath7 from the figure . in the figure",
    ", we can see the tendency that the constraint on @xmath7 becomes tighter for larger @xmath101 , since a positive value of @xmath101 enhances the spectral amplitude at high frequencies . for negative values of @xmath101",
    ", we can see the constraint becomes weaker when @xmath159 is smaller than the frequency of the observational bound .",
    "this is because , for smaller @xmath159 , a negative value of @xmath101 reduces the spectral amplitude at the corresponding frequency of the experiment . on the other hand , for larger @xmath159 ,",
    "the suppression occurs at higher frequency and does not affect the spectrum at the frequency where the observational bounds are relevant .     and @xmath159.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]     upper bound on @xmath7 in the @xmath159@xmath101 plane . here",

    "we have provided more general constraints on the blue - tilted gw spectrum using observational bounds from ligo , pulsar timing and bbn , taking into account the effect of the thermal history after inflation , such as reheating and late - time entropy production .",
    "the recent finding of cmb b - mode polarization by bicep2 suggests the large tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath188 and some analysis pointed out that the data favors a blue - tilted spectrum .",
    "besides , from the theoretical point of view , there are several models of the early universe which predict a blue - tilted spectrum , hence it is worth investigating to what extent blue - tilted spectrum can be allowed by current observational bound on the stochastic gw amplitude .",
    "first , we have found that the suppression of the gw spectrum due to reheating can significantly relax the constraint on the tensor spectral index @xmath7 , depending on the reheating temperature @xmath64 .",
    "we have also shown that , by taking into account the late - time entropy production , the constraint on @xmath7 changes depending on the amount of the produced entropy @xmath84 and the cosmic temperature at the epoch of entropy production @xmath72 .",
    "when one does not take into account the thermal history ( or assuming a very high reheating temperature such as @xmath189  gev ) and assume that the spectral amplitude continue to increase at high frequencies with the spectral index @xmath7 , the constraints on @xmath7 from bbn , ligo and pulsar timing are @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 for @xmath91 at 95  % c.l .",
    ", respectively .",
    "these bounds are modified depending on the assumption of the thermal history : for example , if we consider reheating with @xmath193  gev , these bound are weakened to @xmath194 ( bbn ) , @xmath195 ( ligo ) and @xmath192 ( pulsar ) . if we consider a late - time entropy production after reheating with @xmath146 , @xmath196  gev and @xmath189  gev , the bounds become @xmath197 ( bbn ) , @xmath198 ( ligo ) and @xmath199 ( pulsar ) .",
    "note that the results shown in this paper are all calculated assuming @xmath91 , motivated by the recent bicep2 result .",
    "these bound on @xmath7 changes for different values of @xmath4 . since @xmath4 and @xmath7 are degenerate in the expression of the spectrum as @xmath200 , the constraints on @xmath7 are relaxed for small value of @xmath4 , while the dependencies on the thermal history parameters are the same .",
    "the degree of the relaxation is determined by the value of @xmath201 , which has a different value depending on the experiment .",
    "we have also discussed the constraints using the more generalized modeling of the spectrum , where the spectral power dependence changes at the characteristic frequency @xmath159 and we allow a general power - law form for the spectrum for @xmath202 .",
    "this modeling accommodates various models of the early universe .",
    "we have shown that a significantly blue - tilted spectrum is still allowed in some parameter region , while there are also regions of parameter space where the value of @xmath7 is severely constrained .",
    "thus , the constraint on @xmath7 strongly depends on the underlying models of the early universe .    in this paper",
    ", we have demonstrated that a very blue - tilted gw spectrum can still be allowed in some particular models of the thermal history .",
    "however , in the future , various space - based interferometer experiments are planned , such as elisa @xcite , bbo @xcite and decigo @xcite and so on .",
    "once these experiments are realized , they will put a severe constraint on the spectral index @xmath7 , which would surely help to obtain new insight into the physics of the early universe .",
    "the authors thank k. nakayama and j. yokoyama for helpful discussions . the work is supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research nos .",
    "24 - 2775  ( sy ) and 23740195  ( tt ) from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology in japan .",
    "although we have numerically calculated the integral in the left hand side of eq .   to obtain the bbn constraint in sec .",
    "[ sec : standard ] , here we show that the upper bounds on @xmath7 can be analytically estimated and given in terms of reheating temperature @xmath64 .    assuming the standard thermal history after inflation",
