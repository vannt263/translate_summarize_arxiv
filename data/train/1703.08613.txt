    "the patterns often have a unique enhancement along classical unstable periodic orbits .",
    "such a phenomenon is called scar in quantum stationary states of a finite chaotic region .",
    "the eigen states with scars are called scar states .",
    "in contrast , in integrable billiards , the nodal patterns are essentially repetitive and synthetic .",
    "the eigen states are a genuine quantum mechanical concept , whereas the periodic orbits are apparently classical mechanical objects .",
    "the scar state is an important discovery expressing a providential quantum - classical correspondence .",
    "-coordinate is set along the bottom line of the stadium , and the @xmath0-coordinate is on the left straight boundary .",
    "thus , the origin of the coordinate is located on the left bottom corner .",
    "the wavepacket is launched from @xmath1 and begins travelling with the launching angle @xmath2(a ) , which is defined in the counterclockwise direction from the direction of the @xmath3-axis , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the orbit corresponds to periodic orbit no.7 in @xcite .",
    "after approximately @xmath6 , the wave function almost defuses all over the stadium(f ) .",
    "[ fig.1],width=491 ]    a semiclassical approximation emerged as a powerful tool to clarify scar states in quantum systems along the classical unstable periodic orbits .",
    "this method has been used to construct theories of scars in coordinate space @xcite and phase space @xcite ; they successfully clarify the contribution of the periodic orbits to the scar states .",
    "both theories discuss the scars in energy dependence because the scars first are discovered in the eigen states .",
    "bogomolny @xcite proposed a green s function in terms of actions of classical periodic orbits to expose the periodic orbits as the origins of the scar in the coordinate space .",
    "berry s theory @xcite utilizes the wigner function under approximation in the phase space to clarify the cause of the scars .",
    "in particular , heller s lecture @xcite revealed the dynamical properties of scars , stating that the time - evolving wavepackets propagate near the periodic orbits .",
    "especially , the heller group focused on homoclinic orbits and the return of the gaussian wavepacket to the neighborhood of its launching point in finite regions .",
    "in addition , they realized the importance of the autocorrelation function and its fourier counter part : the weighted spectrum @xcite .",
    "finally , the enhancement or localization in the time - average of the time - evolving wavepacket was discovered @xcite . in this study , it is called as the  dynamical scar \" .",
    "it has a distinctly close relation to scar states because it also emerges along a periodic orbit @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the scar states are shown to heavily contribute to the dynamical states .",
    "the window function @xcite for the semiclassical approximation to describe the enhancement is derived from the weighted power spectrum .",
    "however , it is known that reflection symmetries of billiard s shape sometimes prevents the detection of its genuine chaotic characteristics . to remove the discrete symmetries",
    ", we studied the localization in a desymmetrized @xmath7 stadium billiard @xcite .",
    "the desymmetrization eliminates the two discrete mirror symmetries of the full stadium shape and makes the chaotic properties more evident .",
    "we use table i in ref.@xcite to distinguish the periodic orbits ; however , the table is for a full stadium , and not for a desymmetrized stadium .",
    "therefore , it should be used with caution .",
    "if the periodic orbits pass over the horizontal and vertical axes of the symmetries , they may have to be folded at the crossing points for the desymmetrized stadium ( cf .",
    "fig.2,3 ) .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath8 governs dynamical properties of quantum systems . by adopting the quarter of the @xmath9 stadium ( fig.1@xmath103 ) as the 2d chaotic finite structure ,",
    "the potential is simply set to @xmath11 inside the billiard and @xmath12 outside .",
    "the gaussian wavepacket is a conventional tool used for elucidating the time - evolution of quantum states @xcite .",
    "it has been one of the fundamental quantum objects since the early stage of quantum mechanics .",

    "the standard deviation of the gaussian packet @xmath17 determines its size .     in fig.1 .",
    "the weak concentration appears along the broken yellow lines which represent the corresponding unstable periodic orbit .",
    "it shows the shape of the desymmetrized orbit no.7 in @xcite .",
    "[ fig.2],width=491 ]    if the gaussian wavepacket is placed in a flat infinite space , it travels as a bunch with the initial velocity of the center of the wavepacket @xmath18 .",
    "the absolute value of the wavepacket shows that its shape is always gaussian ; however , its size increases as @xmath19 .",
    "if time is sufficiently long , @xmath20 .    in this study , the wavepacket travels in the finite region , and repeated reflections on the boundary eventually diffuse it all around the billiard ( fig.1 ; cf .",
    "initially it behaves like a bunch of viscous liquid .",
    "the travelling wavepacket then gradually and progressively shows less specific texture . finally , in chaotic billiards , the snapshots of wave function ripple all over the billiard with irregular granular pattern .",
    "on the contrary , the autocorrelation function has surprisingly already revealed long time recurrence @xcite .",
    "moreover , this obliquely implies the localization on the periodic orbit .",
    "one of the most fundamental concepts in quantum physics is the use of the absolute square of the wave function to derive any physical properties ; usually its time average is important to investigate a quantum effect .",
    "therefore , the time - average of the absolute square of the wave function is as follows : @xmath21 this is an appropriate tool to detect the localization that is concerned . here",
    ", @xmath22 expresses the time required to measure the time - average .    for numerical calculation ,",
    "it is discretized as @xmath23 on the mesh points @xmath24 , and the integration over time is the summation over the discretized times @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a time step .",
    "the summation must then be divided by the integer @xmath27 representing the number of whole time steps and apparently @xmath28 . in this study ,",
    "the natural units @xmath29 are always applied for actual numerical evaluation .",
    "the time step is set at @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 , and the lattice constant is 0.2 .",
    "a typical example of calculated @xmath33 is presented in fig.2 .",
    "the time - average expresses clear localization along unstable periodic orbits despite no specific patterns in the snapshots of the wavepackets ( e.g. fig.1(f ) ) .",
    "it is apparently similar to the scars of a stationary wave function @xcite .",
    "furthermore , different launching conditions exibit the same phenomena on various periodic orbits , as shown in fig.3 ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the enhancement appears clearly around the periodic orbit if the initial location of the center of the wavepacket and its velocity are on and along the orbit .",
    "these are referred to as  dynamical scars \" to distinguish them from the scar states in stationary eigen states .",
    "these are an enhancement in the time - average of time - dependent wave function .    any states in quantum systems can be expanded using these eigenfunctions as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath36-th eigen state of the system with energy @xmath37 .",

    "therefore , at least theoretically , the time - average ( 7 ) can be written in energy integration as follows : @xmath48 however , the dirac delta function must be treated carefully to allow comparison of numerical results and experimental data .",
    "the behavior of the delta functions is often smoothed by the limitation of the precision of numerical calculation and experimental measurement .",
    "eq.(8 ) can be considered as the summation of the related wave fuctions and the specific contribution weight that closely correspond to the weighted spectrum because it includes the factor @xmath49 . in numerical calculation",

    "the semiclassical approximation of the wave function diverges at the point due to factor @xmath167 , and @xmath168 is the off - diagonal element of the monodromy matrix@xcite for the unstable classical periodic orbit @xmath149 . in our study , @xmath169 for no.7 ( fig.10 ) , and @xmath170 for no.14 ( fig.11 ) . in both cases @xmath128",

    "the monodromy matrix element @xmath168 becomes zero and @xmath171 diverges at the conjugate point @xmath172 , where the classical orbits near the classical periodic orbit converge .",

    "the window function @xmath73 , which is manipulated from @xmath89 , plays a crucial role for the approximation .    by setting the window size small so that only one eigen state can exist inside the window energy range ,",
