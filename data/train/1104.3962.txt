    "the seesaw mechanism , in its different realisations , constitutes one of the simplest and yet most elegant ways to explain neutrino masses and mixings . in the minimal realisations of the seesaw , the standard model ( sm )",
    "can be extended by the addition of fermionic singlets ( type i seesaw )  @xcite , scalar triplets ( type ii )  @xcite or fermionic triplets ( type iii )  @xcite .",
    "although dependent on the size of the neutrino yukawa couplings ( @xmath3 ) , these new states are in general heavy : assuming natural couplings , @xmath4 , their masses can be close to the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , @xmath5 .",
    "if these states are indeed at the origin of neutrino mass generation , it is important to investigate which seesaw realisation ( or combination thereof ) is at work . indeed ,",
    "if the mass of the mediators is such that production at present colliders is possible ( in this case @xmath6 ) , then one can devise strategies for their direct searches . on the contrary , if they are very heavy , then they can not be directly probed , and their indirect signatures in low - energy observables ( typically via higher order corrections ) will be extremely suppressed .",
    "other than the mechanism of neutrino mass generation , there are several reasons - theoretical issues and observational problems - motivating the extension ( or embedding ) of the sm into a larger framework .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a well motivated solution for the hierarchy problem that also offers an elegant solution for the non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) problem of the universe  @xcite .",
    "if the large hadron collider ( lhc ) indeed finds signatures of susy , it is then extremely appealing to consider the embedding of a seesaw mechanism into a supersymmetric framework ( the so - called susy seesaw ) .",
    "supersymmetric seesaws lead to a number of possible signatures in the neutral and charged lepton sectors , both at low and high energies . among low - energy observables ,",
    "the most striking susy seesaw impact is perhaps the possibility of having charged lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) transitions .",
    "indeed , one can have sizable contributions to radiative decays ( @xmath7 ) , three - body decays ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 transitions in heavy nuclei , well within reach of current and/or future dedicated facilities  @xcite . at high - energy colliders , such as the lhc",
    ", several observables may reflect an underlying susy seesaw .",
    "let us begin by noticing that if some components of the seesaw mediators are not singlets under the sm gauge group ( which is the case in type ii and iii seesaws ) , the latter can leave an imprint on the susy spectrum , since they can modify the supersymmetric @xmath10 functions governing the evolution of the gauge couplings and soft - susy breaking parameters .",
    "at the lhc , susy seesaws can also give rise to several lfv signals : firstly , one can have sizable widths for lfv decay processes like @xmath11  @xcite ; secondly , one can have observable flavoured slepton mass splittings ( ms ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these splittings can be identified since , under certain conditions , one can effectively reconstruct slepton masses via observables such as the kinematic end - point of the invariant mass distribution of the leptons coming from the cascade decays @xmath14 .",
    "if the slepton in the decay chain is real ( on - shell ) , the di - lepton invariant mass spectrum has a kinematical edge that might then be measured with a very high precision ( up to 0.1 % )  @xcite .",
    "together with data arising from other observables , this information allows to reconstruct the slepton masses @xcite and hence study the slepton mass splittings .",
    "finally , one can observe multiple edges in di - lepton invariant mass distributions from @xmath15 , arising from the exchange of a different flavour slepton @xmath16 ( in addition to the left- and right - handed sleptons , @xmath17 ) . under the assumption of a seesaw as the unique underlying source of flavour violation in the leptonic sector ( for instance assuming that susy breaking is due to flavour blind interactions ) , then all the above observables , both at high and low energies , will be strongly correlated .",
    "each seesaw realisation will have a distinct impact on the latter observables .",
    "it is thus mandatory to conduct an exhaustive study of the many possible experimental signatures , in order to test the seesaw hypothesis , either excluding or substantiating it , and in the latter case , devising a strategy to disentangle among the different seesaw realisations .    in a previous work  @xcite",
    "we have studied the impact of a type i seesaw , embedded into the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( cmssm ) , in what concerns lepton flavour violation both at low - energies and at the lhc . here",
    "we extend the analysis to the type iii susy seesaw . in this case , and in order to accommodate neutrino masses and mixings , one adds ( at least two ) fermionic su(2 ) triplets to the sm particle field content  @xcite , as well as the corresponding superpartners . if one extends the usual mssm by just the superfields responsible for neutrino masses and mixings , one would destroy the nice feature of gauge coupling unification .",
    "this problem is easily circumvented by embedding the new states in complete su(5 ) representations , * 24 * -plets in the case of a type iii seesaw  @xcite .",
    "note that in addition to the su(2 ) triplet , the * 24 * -plet contains a singlet state which also contributes to neutrino dynamics , so that in this case one actually has a mixture between type i and type iii seesaws .",
    "our study shows that if a type iii seesaw is indeed the unique source of neutrino masses and leptonic mixings , and is realised within an otherwise flavour conserving susy extension of the sm ( specifically the cmssm ) , one then expects low - energy lfv observables within future sensitivity reach , as well as interesting slepton phenomena at the lhc . after having identified regions in the cmssm parameter space , where the slepton masses could in principle be reconstructed from the kinematical edges of di - lepton mass distributions ( i.e. @xmath18 can occur , and with a non - negligible number of events ) , we study the different slepton mass splittings , exploring the implications for lfv decays . from the comparison of the predictions for the two sets of observables ( high- and low - energy ) with the current experimental bounds and future sensitivities , one can either derive information about the otherwise unreachable seesaw parameters , or disfavour the type iii susy seesaw as being the unique source of lepton flavour violation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : susytypeiii ] we define the model , providing a brief overview on the implementation of a type iii seesaw in the cmssm . in section  [ sec : lfv ] we discuss the implications of this mechanism for low- and high - energy lfv observables .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] where we study the different high- and low - energy observables in the seesaw case .",
    "this will also allow to draw some conclusions on the viability of a supersymmetric type iii seesaw as the underlying mechanism of lfv .",
    "further discussion is presented in the concluding section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "under the hypothesis that neutrinos are majorana particles , the smallness of their masses , as well as their mixings , can be explained via seesaw - like mechanisms due to the exchange of heavy states : fermionic singlets ( type i ) , scalar triplets ( type ii ) or fermionic triplets ( type iii ) .",
    "the three possible seesaw realisations can be easily embedded in the framework of supersymmetric models . however",
    ", if susy s appealing feature of gauge coupling ( and gaugino mass ) unification is to be preserved , the new particles present below the grand unified scale must belong to complete gut representations . under the assumption of an su(5 ) gauge group , generating a neutrino mass matrix with at least two non - zero eigenvalues neutrino mass matrices",
    "can also be obtained with a truly minimal heavy field content , via the inclusion of non - renormalisable operators in the superpotential ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . ]",
    "requires the following multiplet content : two copies of @xmath19 or @xmath20 ( type i and iii , respectively ) or @xmath21 ( type ii ) .",
    "the addition of the non - singlet fields ( i.e. the @xmath22- and the @xmath20-plets ) has an important effect on the evolution of several fundamental parameters , especially on the @xmath23-functions for gauge and yukawa couplings , as well as on the renormalisation group ( rg ) running of mass - terms above the seesaw scale . at low - energies ( electroweak scale )",
    "this translates into changes in the susy spectrum , leading to scenarios that can be significantly different from a minimal supergravity ( msugra ) inspired ( or minimal type i susy seesaw ) scenario . in turn",
    ", this will have consequences concerning flavour observables and cosmological quantities like the dark matter relic density .",
    "we consider in this study a generic framework where three families of triplet fermions , @xmath24 ( as well as their superpartners ) are added to the mssm particle content  @xcite .",
    "each one is embedded into a @xmath20-plet does indeed contain a singlet hypercharge field .",
    "] , that decomposes under the sm gauge group , su(3)@xmath25su(2)@xmath25u(1 ) , as @xmath26 the fermionic components of the last two terms in the above decomposition ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) have exactly the same quantum numbers of a fermionic triplet ( @xmath29 ) and of a singlet right - handed neutrino ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is then clear that if embedded into an su(5 ) framework , the realisation of the type iii seesaw will in general produce a mixture of type i and type iii mechanisms .    in the unbroken su(5 ) phase ,",
    "the superpotential is given by @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting generation ( flavour ) indices , and where we have not included the terms specifying the higgs sector responsible for the breaking of su(5 ) .",
    "the majorana mass term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : su(5):w ] ) is gauge invariant due to having the triplet superfields in the adjoint su(2 ) representation . in the broken phase , in addition to the usual mssm terms , the superpotential is given by : @xmath33 after the heavy fields are integrated out , and at lowest order in the expansion in @xmath34 ( @xmath35 being the vacuum expectation value of @xmath36 ) , one obtains the light neutrino mass matrix : @xmath37 where we have again omitted flavour indices . from the above formula",
    ", it is clear that we are indeed in the presence of a mixed type i and iii seesaw , with contributions to @xmath38 arising from both the singlets ( @xmath39 ) and su(2 ) triplets ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the model is further specified by @xmath41 and by the soft - susy breaking lagrangian . concerning the latter",
    ", we will furthermore assume a cmssm framework , where msugra - inspired universality conditions for the soft - breaking susy parameters are imposed at some very high - energy scale , which we take to be @xmath42 .",
    "the mssm part of the model is then defined by the usual 4 continuous parameters ( the universal gaugino and scalar soft - breaking masses @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the universal trilinear coupling @xmath45 and the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath46 ) and the sign of the bilinear @xmath47-term in @xmath41 , sign(@xmath47 ) .",
    "one can further impose additional gut scale su(5)-motivated boundary conditions for the yukawa couplings and majorana masses appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : brokensu(5):w ] ) : @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "although the above parameters do run between the gut scale and their corresponding decoupling scales , one has , to a very good approximation , that @xmath50 and @xmath51 as the heavy states decouple .",
    "at the seesaw scale ( which we define to be @xmath52 ) @xmath38 is approximately given by @xmath53 where we have again used the simplifying notation @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "up to an overall factor ( @xmath56 ) , one can still use the casas - ibarra parametrization  @xcite for the neutrino yukawa couplings at the seesaw scale @xmath57 , @xmath58 in the above @xmath59 is a complex orthogonal @xmath60 matrix that encodes the possible mixings involving the heavy neutral states , in addition to those of the low - energy sector ( i.e. @xmath61 ) , and which is parametrized in terms of three complex angles @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "as extensively discussed in  @xcite , the @xmath23-functions of the gauge couplings , as well as the running for soft gaugino and scalar masses , are strongly affected in type iii seesaw models .",
    "in fact , rge effects are behind the relatively small interval for @xmath57 in a type iii susy seesaw . assuming that the triplet masses are degenerate ( @xmath64 ) , the interval is bounded from above , @xmath65 gev , to comply with the atmospheric neutrino mass difference . on the other hand , for triplet masses below @xmath66 gev , the running is such that one encounters landau poles for the gauge couplings at the gut scale , while tachyonic sfermions ( especially the lighter stau and stop )",
    "can also arise for smaller values of the soft - susy breaking parameters .",
    "as clear from the above discussion , the new distinctive features of a type iii seesaw will likely be manifest in many phenomena . in what follows",
    "we discuss the new contributions of the type iii susy seesaw for low - energy lepton flavour violation ( e.g. to radiative decays such as @xmath67 ) , as well as for lfv at the lhc : in particular , we focus on the study of slepton mass splittings to probe deviations from the cmssm and possibly derive information about the susy seesaw parameters .",
    "as for the case of a type i susy seesaw , the non - trivial flavour structure of @xmath3 at the gut scale will induce ( through the running from @xmath42 down to the seesaw scale ) flavour mixing in the otherwise approximately flavour conserving soft - susy breaking terms . in particular , there will be radiatively induced flavour mixing in the slepton mass matrices , manifest in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 blocks of the @xmath70 slepton mass matrix ; an analytical estimation using the leading order ( llog ) approximation leads to the following corrections to the slepton mass terms  @xcite : @xmath71 when compared to the type i susy seesaw , the most important difference corresponds to a change in the overall factor ( multiplying the @xmath72 term ) .",
    "the above sources of flavour mixing will have an impact regarding lepton flavour non - universality and lepton flavour violation in the charged slepton sector , potentially inducing sizable contributions to high- and low - energy lfv observables , as we proceed to discuss .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", several lfv signals can be observable at the lhc , in strict relation with the @xmath73 decay chains . as discussed in  @xcite , in scenarios where the @xmath74 is sufficiently heavy to decay via a real ( on - shell ) slepton , the process @xmath75 is greatly enhanced while providing a very distinctive signal : same - flavour opposite - charged leptons with missing energy .",
    "the @xmath76 decay chain thus offers a golden laboratory to study lfv at the lhc , via the following observables : + ( i ) sizable widths for lfv decay processes like @xmath77  @xcite ;    \\(ii ) multiple edges in di - lepton invariant mass distributions @xmath78 , arising from the exchange of a different flavour slepton @xmath79 ( in addition to the left- and right - handed sleptons , @xmath80 ) ;    \\(iii ) flavoured slepton mass splittings .    in order to optimise",
    "the reconstruction of the leptons momentum ( which is expected to be easy , accounting for smearing effects in @xmath81 s ) and , in addition , extract indirect information on the mass spectrum of the involved sparticles , the susy spectrum must comply with the requirements of a so - called `` standard window '' : + ( a ) the spectrum is such that the decay chain @xmath82 , with intermediate real sleptons , is allowed ;    \\(b ) it is possible to have sufficiently hard outgoing leptons : @xmath83 gev .    in this case , the di - lepton invariant mass spectrum has a kinematical edge that might be measured with a very high precision ( up to 0.1 % )  @xcite .",
    "together with data arising from other observables , this information allows to reconstruct the slepton masses @xcite , and hence probe slepton mass universality or test lfv in the slepton sector .",
    "in particular , the relative slepton mass splittings , which are defined as @xmath84 can be inferred from the kinematical edges with a sensitivity of @xmath85  @xcite for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 .    even in the absence of a seesaw mechanism ,",
    "it is important to recall that universality between the third and first two slepton generations is broken due to @xmath69 mixing and to rge effects proportional to the third generation lepton yukawa coupling .",
    "however , in the presence of flavour violation ( as induced by the susy seesaw , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lfv : llog ] ) ) , the mass differences between left - handed selectrons , smuons and staus can be potentially augmented .",
    "similar to the case of a type i seesaw  @xcite , the relative mass splitting between left - handed sleptons is approximately given by @xmath89 where we have neglected @xmath69 mixing effects , as well as rge contributions proportional to the charged lepton yukawa coupling .",
    "in the @xmath90 seesaw limit , where all flavour violation in @xmath3 stems from the @xmath91 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : seesaw : casas ] ) ) , and assuming that the large flavour violating entries involving the second and third generation constitute the dominant source of mixing ( and are thus at the origin of the slepton mass differences ) , one can further relate the @xmath92 and the @xmath93 mass differences  @xcite : @xmath94 as discussed in  @xcite , in the framework of a type i seesaw , the slepton mass differences can be sufficiently large as to be within the reach of lhc sensitivity .    before proceeding , let us briefly notice that , depending on the amount of flavour violation , one can be led to regimes where two non - degenerate mass eigenstates have almost identical flavour content ( maximal flavour mixing ) . to correctly interpret a mass splitting between sleptons with quasi - degenerate flavour content , one has to introduce an `` effective '' mass @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the matrix that diagonalizes the @xmath70 slepton mass matrix .",
    "the effective mass splittings are then defined as @xmath97    the seesaw - generated flavour violating entries of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lfv : llog ] ) will also give rise to low - energy lfv phenomena , such as radiative @xmath7 decays , which are induced by 1-loop diagrams via the exchange of gauginos and sleptons .",
    "these can be described by the effective lagrangian  @xcite , @xmath98 where @xmath99 are the usual chirality projectors and the couplings @xmath100 and @xmath101 arise from loops involving left- and right - handed sleptons , respectively .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagmueg ] ) , the branching ratio @xmath7 is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the fermi constant and @xmath104 is the electromagnetic coupling constant . in our numerical calculation",
    "we use the exact expressions for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "however , for an easier understanding of the numerical results , we note that the relations between these couplings and the slepton soft - breaking masses are approximately given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes a generic ( average ) susy mass and where we have used eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lfv : llog ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice here that when compared to other seesaws , and for the same cmssm parameters , the sparticle spectrum is lighter .",
    "together with the larger yukawa couplings ( a consequence of the larger seesaw scale ) , the type iii seesaw typically leads to larger lfv observables than in either type i or ii  @xcite .",
    "equally interesting lfv observables are @xmath9 conversions in heavy nuclei , as they offer challenging experimental prospects : the possibility of improving experimental sensitivities to values as low as @xmath107 renders this observable an extremely powerful probe of lfv in the muon - electron sector . in the limit of photon - penguin dominance , the conversion rate cr(@xmath9 ,  n ) and br(@xmath108 )",
    "are strongly correlated , since both observables are sensitive to the same leptonic mixing parameters  @xcite .    in the following section we numerically analyse the above discussed points .",
    "for the numerical computation , we have used the public code spheno ( v3.beta.51 )  @xcite to carry out the numerical integration of the rges .",
    "the rges of the su(5 ) type iii susy seesaw were calculated at 2-loop level in  @xcite , using the public code sarah@xcite .",
    "spheno further computes the sparticle and higgs spectrum , as well as the various low - energy lfv observables .",
    "the dark matter relic density is evaluated through a link to v2.2  @xcite .",
    "regarding low - energy neutrino data , current ( best - fit ) analyses favour the following intervals for the mixing angles  @xcite @xmath109 while for the mass - squared differences one has @xmath110 where the two ranges for @xmath111 correspond to inverted and normal neutrino spectrum . in table",

[ cols=\"<,^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we now consider more general scenarios of non - degenerate spectrum for the heavy triplets . in order to investigate this regime , we fix the heaviest ( lightest ) triplet mass to the upper ( lower ) limits of the @xmath112 interval previously obtained , and allow the next - to - lightest triplet mass to vary between the latter limits . for such a non - degenerate triplet spectrum , we display in fig .  [",
    "fig : ndmasses : br : deltams : emu ] an analogous study to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : br : deltams : emu ] ( same choice of the susy parameters , still working in the limiting case of @xmath90 ) . as can be observed ,",
    "the area complying with all requirements ( cyan band ) is now comparatively larger .",
    "the @xmath113 slepton mass differences are also enhanced when compared to the degenerate case : for all three regimes of @xmath114 tev , one has @xmath115 .",
    "remarkably , one can have @xmath116 , in agreement with current bounds on br(@xmath108 ) . concerning the amount of lfv inducing the @xmath108 transitions ,",
    "one finds that , similar to what occurs in the degenerate case , the largest brs are associated with @xmath117 close to its maximal allowed value ( i.e. @xmath118 , leading to degenerate heavy and next - to - heavy triplets ) and minimal values of @xmath43 .",
    "while the latter leads to a lighter spectrum , the former allows to enhance the @xmath119 contributions proportional to @xmath117 , which are not suppressed by the smallness of @xmath120 .",
    "however , it is important to notice that the same does not occur regarding br(@xmath121 ) , which is maximal for both minimal values of @xmath43 and @xmath117 ( now degenerate with the lightest triplet ) . for fixed values of @xmath122 , while the flavour violating entries responsible for @xmath123 transitions and other decays involving the first lepton family ( i.e. @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) increase with increasing @xmath117 , @xmath126 - which induces br(@xmath121 ) - remains approximately constant : in fact it actually decreases by a small factor , since the contributions proportional to @xmath117 have the opposite sign of those associated to @xmath127 .    finally , and to conclude our numerical study ,",
    "we have considered deviations from the @xmath90 limit , i.e. , allowing for additional mixings in the seesaw mediators .",
    "non - vanishing angles @xmath128 lead to larger @xmath129 , with implications for lfv observables : as expected ( and aside from eventual accidental cancelations ) , there is a large enhancement of the contributions to low - energy lfv observables , as well as an increase of the mass splittings . more concretely , this would displace the cyan regions in figs .  [",
    "fig : br : deltams : emu ] and [ fig : ndmasses : br : deltams : emu ] towards larger values of br(@xmath123 ) - potentially excluded by current bounds - and towards slightly larger @xmath130 mass differences .",
    "notice that when compared to the type i susy seesaw , the effects of @xmath131 are somewhat less important , since due to the much narrower interval of the seesaw scale ( which is also heavier ) , perturbativity of @xmath3 effectively constraints the values of @xmath128 .",
    "concerning the impact of these variations on the susy spectrum ( rge induced ) , we have verified that deviations from @xmath90 have no effect on the gaugino and squark spectra .    to summarise , let us re - emphasise that should the @xmath132 decay chain be reconstructed at the lhc , a type iii susy seesaw will be manifest in both low- and high - energy lfv observables , which will lie within the sensitivity of present / future experimental facilities . in other words ,",
    "finding regions in the type iii susy seesaw parameter space where the @xmath132 is present , without observing neither @xmath108 transitions at meg , nor @xmath133 at the lhc , is almost impossible .",
    "although it is a very appealing hypothesis to explain the origin of neutrino masses and mixings , the seesaw mechanism is in general very hard to probe directly . when embedded into a larger framework ( as for instance susy models ) , where new states are active between the seesaw scale and the electroweak one , the seesaw mechanism can give rise to many distinct signatures , depending on the nature of the mediators : scalar or fermionic ( gauge singlets or triplets ) . in this study we considered a supersymmetric type iii seesaw where , in order to preserve gauge coupling unification , the additional states are embedded into complete su(5 ) representations",
    ". the many experimental constraints ( lep , lhc , low - energy experiments ) strongly reduce the available parameter space of the model , so that one expects very characteristic signals ( susy spectrum and charged lfv , both at low - energies and at the lhc ) , which offer the possibility of falsifying the model . using the correlation between the different lfv observables ( inherent from the assumption that the seesaw provides the only source of flavour violation in the model ) ,",
    "we have focused our analysis on the interplay between low - energy radiative decays ( e.g. @xmath134 ) and potential lfv signatures appearing in association with the @xmath135 cascade decays at the lhc , such as flavoured slepton mass splittings , @xmath136 .",
    "firstly , requiring that the spectrum allows for the reconstruction of slepton masses from the @xmath137 cascade decay chains ( and assuming a @xmath138 lsp ) , the type iii susy seesaw leads to scenarios where a heavy susy spectrum ( e.g. @xmath139 tev ) is in general favoured .",
    "although viable dark matter scenarios are in general very hard to accommodate in the type iii seesaw , we have nevertheless verified that one can still find small regions in the parameter space where the @xmath138 has the correct relic density .",
    "such scenarios typically arise in association with the low @xmath44 regime .",
    "concerning dark matter , it is important to recall that other candidates might be present and have a relic density in agreement with wmap bounds , as could be the case for gravitinos .",
    "this issue clearly lies beyond the scope of the present work .    assuming that a type iii seesaw is indeed the only source of lfv , and given the extremely constrained parameter space",
    ", one finds that the corresponding slepton mass splittings will always lie around the % level , and are thus within the expected sensitivity of the lhc .",
    "a hierarchical fermionic triplet spectrum further boosts the expected mass splittings : one is led to a regime where , even in the conservative limit of @xmath90 , one has @xmath140 , in agreement with current bounds on charged lfv .",
    "furthermore , these mass splittings correspond to values of br(@xmath108 ) well within the expected sensitivity of meg ( or , in very limiting cases , within prism / prime sensitivity for cr(@xmath9 , ti ) ) .    in the more general case of an increased mixing involving the triplet sector ( i.e. @xmath141 )",
    ", there is an enhancement of the contributions to low - energy lfv observables , as well as a small increase in the slepton mass splittings , without further impact on the remaining susy spectrum .",
    "unlike what occurs for a type i susy seesaw , the very constrained range for the type iii seesaw scale strongly tightens the predictions for lfv : the expected flavoured mass splittings are indeed well within the sensitivity range of the lhc , while at the same time low - energy scale lfv must unavoidably lie within the present and future sensitivity of either meg or prism / prime ( observation of a @xmath121 signal at superb will be much more challenging ) .",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered at the lhc , and a type iii seesaw is at the origin of flavour mixing in the lepton sector , then this model can be easily falsified in the near future .",
