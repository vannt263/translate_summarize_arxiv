    "these intermediate - size moonlets are not directly seen , but rather the propeller - shaped disturbances they create in the ring continuum .",

    "the sizes of the perturbing moonlets , subject to some ambiguities in interpretation , were given as @xmath6 meters .",
    "their surface densities are quite low relative to smaller particles , corroborating the steep cutoff reported by @xcite .",

    "four of these objects are those reported by @xcite , and another eight were first noted by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have found evidence for similarly - sized moonlets in the narrow and highly disturbed f  ring ; however , this is not directly applicable to our analysis because there is no particular reason to expect the particle - size distribution of the f  ring to be simply related to that of the a  ring .",

    "[ illustration],width=377 ]",
    "the general morphology of propeller - shaped features , hereafter `` propellers '' , can be understood from the classical hill problem , in which massless test particles orbiting a large central body are deflected in the vicinity of a perturbing mass , hereafter the `` moonlet '' ( see fig .  [ illustration ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that this is a simple model for conceptual purposes only , as perturbing effects such as inter - particle collisions and self - gravity wakes ( see below ) complicate the actual picture considerably .    due to keplerian shear , the chaotic zone in which test particles are cleared out by the moonlet",
    "is carried forward on the inward side , while that on the outward side trails behind .",
    "the clearing of particles from these chaotic zones results in two gaps , oriented primarily along the orbital direction , symmetric about the origin in the shape of a propeller ( fig .",
    "[ illustration ] ) .",
    "the separation between these gaps in the radial direction is approximately 4 times the hill radius[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "herafter , we will refer to this aspect of a moonlet s disturbance , which is a local decrease in the total surface density , as _ * propeller - shaped gaps*_.    regions of enhanced surface density can also be created by the perturbing moonlet .",
    "the genesis of these density enhancements , as is easily seen in the non - self - gravitating case shown in fig .  [ illustration ] , is essentially the same as the `` moonlet wakes '' that are seen elsewhere in the rings on a larger scale  for example , in the vicinity of pan @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to this aspect of a moonlet s disturbance as _ * moonlet wakes*_. these are farther from the moonlet , in terms of radial displacement , than are the gaps .",
    "they also differ from the gaps in their general morphology , being less consistently oriented in the azimuthal direction , though this distinction could possibly be less important in more realistic cases that account for self - gravity wakes .    in reality , the motion of particles in saturn s rings is far from the laminar flow portrayed in the hill problem .",
    "inter - particle collisions play a significant role , especially at locations where streamlines cross , but even more important are `` self - gravity wakes''[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite , a constant clumping together and shearing apart of ring particles as their mutual gravity is balanced against saturn s tides .",
    "self - gravity wakes pervade the a  ring and significantly affect its photometry @xcite . in numerical simulations",
    "@xcite , the wakes produced by considering particle self - gravity cause a propeller s morphology to be altered significantly . as one changes the particle - size regime as well as the perturbing moonlet size , the strength ( i.e. , deviation from the continuum background ) and the azimuthal length of the propeller feature can vary , and the region of moonlet wakes can change in shape or even disappear .",
    "however , the existence of a propeller - shaped gap and the radial separation between the two lobes have so far appeared in every model in which the perturbing moonlet is large enough to produce any signature at all .",
    "the morphology of observed propellers fits best with the gaps ( regions of diminished surface density ) seen in models , with two unitary offset lobes that are oriented precisely in the azimuthal direction @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that propellers are observed as bright features relative to background requires us to consider the possibility that the observed features are caused by moonlet wakes , rather than gaps .",
    "we will refer to this ambiguity in section  [ results ] , and discuss it explicitly in section  [ interpretation ] .",
    "the images in which our propellers have been found were taken by the imaging science subsystem @xcite on board the _ cassini _ spacecraft , on several occasions during its tour of the saturn system . the viewing geometry is described in table  [ observeinfo ] , in which images taken during the same observing sequence are grouped together .",
    "the two discovery images @xcite , taken during _ cassini _ s saturn orbit insertion maneuver ( soi ) upon its arrival at saturn on 1  july  2004 ( day - of - year 183 ) , remain the highest - resolution images ever obtained of the rings .",
    "propellers were next found in a suite of images taken in orbit  13 during an occultation by the rings of the star @xmath13  scorpii , an event planned by _ cassini _",

    ", a propeller was captured in one of a series of 105 images of the encke gap . in each of these cases ,",
    "the propellers were seen in diffuse transmission , with the camera on the unlit side of the rings .",
    "more recently , propellers have been captured during four complete , high - resolution radial scans of the sunlit side of the rings at high resolution during orbits  28 , 31 , 32 and  46 .",
    "other images were taken during the soi maneuver in which propellers might have been detected but were not .",
    "a second pair of ultra - high - resolution ( @xmath14  km / pixel ) images , similar to the discovery images , was taken of the mid - a  ring with similar emission and phase angles ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "these are probably significant non - detections ; the footprint of one ( n1467347504 ) lies at 132,580  km , just beyond the outer edge of the propeller belt ( see section  [ locs ] ) , while that of the other ( n1467347445 ) falls within the moderate - strength prometheus 12:11 spiral density wave ( see section  [ locs ] ) .",
    "the primary soi data set was a series of 39 high - resolution images , incompletely covering the rings at resolutions of 0.16  to 0.28  km / pixel @xcite ; these images have somewhat higher emission and lower phase angles than the ultra - high - resolution images , but may lack propellers primarily because of the low signal - to - noise that was necessary to prevent smear due to high spacecraft velocity .",

    "this yields a surface number density for large propellers of @xmath49  km@xmath50 averaged over the annulus from 126,000 to 132,000  km from saturn s center , though some regions within that annulus are an order of magnitude more propeller - rich than others ( fig .",

    "the surface number density of smaller propellers can be estimated from the 4 examples seen in soi images , in which they are quite well - resolved , yielding a value of @xmath52  km@xmath50 for propellers with @xmath53  km @xcite .",

    "furthermore , although one might expect unresolved features to be propellers that are too small to be resolved in the current images , their characteristic sizes in each observing sequence are only slightly smaller than resolved features in the same sequence .",

    "radial separation is the only measurement for which the very well - resolved soi propellers are not the smallest propellers in our data set ; it is also the measurement most closely related to moonlet size , leading to the conclusion that the soi propellers anomaly in other dimensional measurements merely reflects the improved resolution of the soi images .",

    "the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath64 and @xmath27 is only 0.24 .",
    "analytical theory indicates that the length of propeller - shaped gaps should scale as @xmath66 @xcite , where @xmath67 is the local dynamical viscosity , as random non - keplerian velocities cause ring particles to fill in the propeller s gaps through diffusion .",
    "this relation was confirmed in the numerical models of @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim their failure to fit their data with a curve of the form @xmath68 is evidence that observed propeller - shaped features are due to moonlet wakes rather than propeller - shaped gaps ( see section  [ propellers ] for definitions , and section  [ interpretation ] for further discussion ) .",
    "however , these analyses neglect the effects of mutual gravity among ring particles , particularly the self - gravity wakes that are ubiquitous in this region of the a  ring @xcite . more detailed simulations of propellers in the a  ring s environment are ongoing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but have yet to put significant constraints on length scaling .",
    "furthermore , the local dynamical viscosity ( @xmath67 ) in the propeller - rich region was recently shown to fluctuate significantly , as well as generally increasing by nearly an order of magnitude from 126,750 to 132,000  km from saturn s center , as indicated by modeling of spiral density waves @xcite .",
    "thus , drawing robust conclusions from the length of propellers will be a complex task .",
    "the integrated brightness above the background for modeled propellers is @xmath69 for the primary model ( eq .  [ doublegaussianmodel ] ) and @xmath70 for the secondary model ( eq .  [ singlegaussianmodel ] ) .",

    "[ propbrightness ] .",
    "all features in our data set are brighter than their background ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) , though dark features should be just as easily detectable .",

    "we also note that orbit  13 views the unlit side of the rings , orbit  46 the lit side .",
    "( a higher median brightness is obtained for the low - phase orbit  28 data , but this is likely a result of dimmer objects being undetectable in the lower - resolution data , rather than a phase effect . ) the lack of significant brightening with increasing phase angle ( comparing orbit  13 to orbit  46 ) indicates that the observed features are likely composed primarily of macroscopic particles , rather than dust .    , width=377 ]      analytical theory indicates that the radial separation between the two lobes of a propeller - shaped gap ( @xmath27 ) should be 4  times the hill radius of the central moonlet ( section  [ propellers ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , detailed numerical simulations that take particle self - gravity into account have not directly addressed this issue , but preliminary indications are that the result @xmath72 holds ( d.  c.  richardson , private communication , 2006 ) . on the other hand , the average separation between moonlet wakes ( see fig .  [ illustration ] ) is larger , from @xmath73 to @xmath74 ; it is also more difficult to quantify ( as moonlet wakes do not generally lie along the azimuthal direction ) and varies with the parameters of a given simulation .",
    "we can thus infer properties of the embedded moonlet , if we assume we are observing propeller gaps ( see section  [ interpretation ] ) ; in this case , fig .",
    "[ prop_locs]f indicates that the largest embedded moonlets ( @xmath75  km ) have masses @xmath76  g and diameters @xmath77  m if their density is equal to the roche critical density[multiblock footnote omitted ] of 0.5  g @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "a lower limit on propeller size can be drawn from the conclusion of @xcite that propellers do not form if the embedded moonlet is not significantly larger than the largest particles that are abundant in the ring continuum .",
    "thus , a propeller - causing moonlet must have @xmath79  m , which , using the assumptions given in this paragraph , would result in @xmath80  m. in our data set , only 3 of the 78 resolved propellers ( 4% ) have error bars that are entirely below this value ; the discovery of a significant population of resolved propellers with @xmath81  m would be evidence against interpreting observed propellers as gaps .",
    "for images of the unlit side of the rings ( including the original soi detections ) , some ambiguity exists in principle as to whether locally bright features are due to an increase or a decrease in local optical depth @xcite . for propellers ,",
    "this ambiguity is largely resolved by the further data reported here , including many images of the lit side of the rings , that indicate that propellers are generally local increases in the effective optical depth  which is to say that the observed structures contain more material interacting with light than does the background . from this one",
    "might conclude that what is being seen are the density enhancements ( wakes ) around the propeller , rather than the propeller - shaped gaps themselves ( see section  [ propellers ] ) .",
    "however , this inference confronts two major problems .",
    "firstly , the morphology of observed propellers strongly favors gaps over moonlet wakes : the bright bands in fig .",
    "[ propexamples ] appear like the open regions in fig .",
    "[ illustration ] . secondly , because a smaller central moonlet is required to produce a given observed value of @xmath27 , if it refers to the separation between moonlet wakes , this interpretation results in more inferred central moonlets ( 12% , rather than the 4% reported above ) that would not be significantly larger than the largest particles that are abundant in the ring continuum , a condition under which simulated propellers do not form according to some models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in simulations presented by @xcite , propeller gaps appear under certain conditions without any significant associated moonlet wakes .",
    "however , the converse is not true , and the question then arises : if it is wakes that are being observed , where are the gaps ?    one possible resolution of this conundrum has been proposed by @xcite : that ring - particle regolith is temporarily liberated by the effects of the embedded moonlet , locally increasing the optical depth ( but not the mass density ) within the propeller until the material is re - accreted onto continuum ring particles .",
    "a role may also be played by a moonlet s varying effects on ring particles of various sizes .",
    "due to gravitational scattering by larger ring particles , smaller particles ( with sizes between 1  and 10  cm ) may already have eccentricities as large as that imparted by an encounter with the moonlet , and thus may be less affected by the moonlet .",
    "these small particles interact more effectively with light than a large particle of the same total mass , but are too numerous to include in present numerical simulations ; they may be at least partly reponsible for propeller gaps that are brighter than simulations predict.[multiblock footnote omitted ] a similar effect may have been seen in the keeler gap , where brightness is enhanced in the wavy gap edges surrounding the moon daphnis , even though numerical simulations indicate a decrease in particle density at such locations @xcite .",
    "we suggest , only briefly in this paper , a different way in which the _ effective _ optical depth need not correlate exactly with the total amount of material present .",
    "the a  ring is not a homogeneous sheet of material , but rather consists of a matrix of self - gravity wakes that are nearly opaque , while only the low-@xmath82 spaces between the wakes are able to transmit light to an obsever on the unlit side of the rings ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a moonlet embedded in the ring may locally disrupt the self - gravity wakes , releasing more material into the optically active component even as the total amount of material is lessened in the propeller gap .",
