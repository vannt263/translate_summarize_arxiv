    "this allowed popovic to give some very interesting results about critical processes , and similar techniques were built upon in various ways by her and other authors @xcite .",
    "although these are certainly related to our investigation , they generally require that we look at the entire population alive at time @xmath0 , rather than sampling a fixed number of individuals , which results in a different scaling regime . biological motivation for why we might like to sample a fixed number of individuals from a growing population  that is , our regime  can be found in @xcite .      for a moment forget about the scaling limit , and consider a birth - death process ( that is , fix @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and suppose that @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , with @xmath93 for @xmath94 ) .",
    "wait until time @xmath0 , and then colour any particle that has a descendant alive at time @xmath0 purple , and any particle whose descendants all die before time @xmath0 red .",

    "we are not interested in whether particles survive forever , only whether they survive to time @xmath0 , so we colour such particles purple .",
    "of course red particles in our picture are also red in the harris - hesse - kyprianou picture , whereas each of our purple particles may be either red or blue in their colouring .",
    "now suppose that , rather than running the birth - death process until time @xmath0 and then colouring all the particles , we want to construct the coloured picture dynamically as the process evolves .",
    "if we start with one particle and condition on the process surviving until time @xmath0 , then the first particle is certainly purple , since at least one of its descendants must survive .",

    "using generating functions one can show that @xmath235 see section [ bdgenfuncts ] for details .",
    "if a purple particle branches at time @xmath61 , then its two children could be either both purple , or one red and one purple .",

    "give birth to new purple particles at rate @xmath240 similar calculations can be done generally , rather than just for birth - death processes .",
    "however it is easy to see that in near - critical cases the probability that a purple particle has more than two purple children at any branching event will tend to zero , so in a sense the important information is captured by the simpler birth - death calculations .",
    "indeed we saw in theorem [ nearcritthm ] that in our scaling limit , only the mean of the branching process really matters ; and we will see again in lemma [ splitsdistinct ] that only binary splits appear in the limit . for this non - rigorous discussion",
    "we therefore carry out our calculations only in the birth - death case .",
    "of course , to understand the coalescent structure of the tree drawn out by particles chosen at time @xmath0 , we can ignore the red particles ; only the purple tree matters .",
    "let us now return to a near - critical scaling limit by assuming that @xmath241 for some @xmath242 . at time @xmath178 , the purple tree branches at rate @xmath243 scaling time onto @xmath28 $ ] , at time @xmath155 the purple tree branches at rate @xmath244 since @xmath245 we see that the purple tree in the near - critical scaling limit is the same as a yule tree ( binary branching at rate @xmath149 ) observed under the time change @xmath246    following the same route in the purely critical case @xmath128 gives that the rescaled purple tree branches at rate @xmath247 , which corresponds to a yule tree under the time change @xmath248 .",
    "these rough calculations help to explain the similarities between our formulas in the near - critical scaling limit ( theorem [ nearcritthm ] ) and in the birth - death process ( theorem [ noncritbdthm ] ) .",
    "in this section we lay down many of the technical tools that we will need to prove the results in the previous sections .",
    "our two most important signposts will be proposition [ firstprop ] , which translates questions about uniformly chosen particles under @xmath37 into calculations under a new measure @xmath249 ; and proposition [ qmgf_gen_prop ] , which is a version of campbell s formula under @xmath249 which will be central to our analysis .",
    "first , of course , we must introduce @xmath249 , and we begin by describing the idea of _ spines _ , which introduce extra information into our tree by allocating _ marks _ to certain special particles .",
    "spine methods are now well known and a thorough treatment can be found for example in @xcite . we give only a brief introduction .",
    "we define a new measure @xmath250 under which there are @xmath1 distinguished lines of descent , which we call spines .",
    "briefly , @xmath250 is simply an extension of @xmath37 in that all particles behave as in the original branching process ; the only difference is that some particles carry marks showing that they are part of a spine .    under @xmath250 particles",
    "behave as follows :    * we begin with one particle which carries @xmath1 marks @xmath251 .",
    "* we think of each of the marks @xmath252 as distinguishing a particular line of descent or `` spine '' , and define @xmath253 to be the label of whichever particle carries mark @xmath70 at time @xmath7 . * a particle carrying @xmath71 marks @xmath254 at time @xmath7 branches at rate @xmath4 , dying and being replaced by a random number of particles according to the law of @xmath2 , independently of the rest of the system , just as under @xmath37 . *",
    "given that @xmath108 particles @xmath255 are born at a branching event as above , the @xmath71 marks each choose a particle to follow independently and uniformly at random from amongst the @xmath108 available .",
    "thus for each @xmath256 and @xmath257 the probability that @xmath258 carries mark @xmath259 just after the branching event is @xmath260 , independently of all other marks . * if a particle carrying @xmath261 marks @xmath254 dies and is replaced by 0 particles , then its marks are transferred to the graveyard @xmath57 .",
    "again we emphasise that under @xmath250 , the system behaves exactly as under @xmath37 except that some particles carry extra marks showing the lines of descent of @xmath1 spines .",
    "we write @xmath262 .",
    "obviously @xmath263 depends on @xmath1 too , but we omit this from the notation .",
    "we let @xmath264 be the number of distinct spines ( i.e.  the number of particles carrying marks ) at time @xmath7 , and for @xmath265 @xmath266 with @xmath267 .",
    "we view @xmath268 as the @xmath70th spine split time ( although , for example , the first and second spine split times may be equal  corresponding to marks following three different particles at the first branching event ) .",
    "we also let @xmath269 be the number of marks following spine @xmath70 .",
    "the set of distinct spine particles at any time @xmath7 , and the marks that are following those spine particles , induce a partition @xmath270 of @xmath69 .",

    "if we then let @xmath272 for @xmath83 , we have created a discrete collection of partitions @xmath273 which describe the topological information about the spines without the information about the spine split times .",

    ", there exists a last time at which @xmath42 was a spine ( which may be @xmath7 ) .",
    "if this time equals @xmath268 for some @xmath70 , then we say that @xmath42 is a _ residue _ particle ; if it does not equal @xmath268 for any @xmath70 , and @xmath42 is not a spine , then we say that @xmath42 is _ ordinary_. each particle is exactly one of residue , ordinary , or a spine .",
