    "the past @xmath3  years have seen a lively controversy over the phase diagrams of transition metals at megabar pressures , with the pressure dependence of the melting temperature @xmath4 from diamond - anvil - cell ( dac ) measurements differing greatly from that deduced from shock data and from first - principles calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ figintro ] ) .",
    "@xcite one suggested resolution of the controversy is that the transition interpreted as melting in some of the dac experiments may in fact be a solid - solid crystallographic transformation , and in the case of molybdenum this is consistent with the observation of two transitions in shock experiments .",
    "@xcite this suggestion appeared to be confirmed by recent first - principles work on mo , which indicated a transition from the low - temperature body - centred - cubic ( bcc ) structure to a close - packed structure in the appropriate temperature region .",
    "@xcite however , that work relied on two important assumptions , which we examine in detail in this paper .",
    "the results we shall present imply that those assumptions and the conclusions drawn from them may be incorrect , so that further work is still needed to resolve the controversy .",
    "dac measurements have been reported on the melting curves of several transition metals , including ti , v , cr , fe , co , ni , mo , ta and w.  @xcite the measurements extend up to nearly @xmath5  gpa ( @xmath6  mbar ) , and in most cases the increase of melting temperature @xmath7 between ambient pressure and @xmath5  gpa is surprisingly small ; in the case of mo , the increase is only @xmath8  k.  @xcite these findings are in stark contrast to the melting curves deduced from shock measurements , which are available for fe , mo , ta and w.  @xcite for mo , the increase of @xmath7 between ambient and @xmath5  gpa estimated from shock data is @xmath9  k. recently , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the melting curves of mo and ta have been reported .",
    "@xcite the dft predictions are expected to be reliable , because it is well known that dft , without any adjustable parameters , gives excellent results for a wide range of properties of transition metals , including cold compression curves up to @xmath10  gpa ,  @xcite hugoniot @xmath11 curves ,  @xcite phonon dispersion relations ( and their pressure dependence , in the case of fe ) ,  @xcite and low - temperature phase boundaries .",
    "@xcite furthermore , techniques for calculating melting curves using dft have become firmly established over the past @xmath3 years and more , and are known to give accurate results .",
    "@xcite the dft results for @xmath12 of mo and ta lend support to the correctness of the melting curves deduced from shock data .",
    "@xcite    it has become clear very recently that experimental difficulties may have led to a substantial underestimate of high-@xmath0 melting temperatures in earlier dac measurements . the work of dewaele _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicates that formation of metal carbide by chemical reaction between the diamond and the metal sample can be a major problem .",
    "their work also shows that difficulties in the pyrometric measurement of temperature can also lead to substantial underestimates of @xmath13 . in the case of ta ,",
    "their measurements give a melting curve that is well above those given by earlier dac experiments and is fairly close to ( though systematically lower than ) the predictions from dft .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of mo , the occurrence of two breaks in the shock data seems to leave little doubt that there is a transition from the low-@xmath2 bcc structure to an unidentified high-@xmath2 crystal structure , followed by the melting of the latter .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath0 of the lower transition ( 3500  k and 200  gpa ) lie close to the natural extrapolation of the @xmath14 boundary identified as melting in the older dac experiments .",
    "this suggests that this boundary is associated with a bcc - solid transition . even in the case of ta ,",
    "recent evidence based on dft calculations  @xcite indicates that a bcc - solid transition is implicated in earlier dac attempts to detect high-@xmath0 melting .    to substantiate the picture of a bcc - solid transition followed by a melting transition , it is necessary to show that another crystal structure becomes thermodynamically more stable than bcc at high temperatures , and to identify this structure",
    "this was the aim of the recent dft work on mo by belonoshko _",
    "et al_.  @xcite they showed that , in the quasiharmonic approximation , the gibbs free energy of the fcc structure is lower than that of bcc over a substantial high-@xmath0/high-@xmath2 region of the phase diagram below the bcc melting curve .",
    "the fcc structure becomes harmonically unstable ( there are imaginary phonon frequencies ) for @xmath15  gpa , but extrapolation of the predicted bcc - fcc phase boundary passes quite close to the @xmath16 of the lower shock transition .",
    "the quasiharmonic calculations on the bcc and fcc free energies were independently confirmed by two subsequent papers .  @xcite as independent evidence that fcc is more stable than bcc at high  @xmath2 , belonoshko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the z method  @xcite to calculate the melting curve of fcc mo .",
    "( the z method employs observations of spontaneous melting of the superheated solid in constant - energy molecular dynamics simulations to determine points on the melting curve . )",
    "they found that the fcc melting curve lies above the bcc melting curve , thus appearing to confirm that the free energy of fcc is lower than bcc .",
    "however , we note the two important assumptions made here : first , that anharmonic contributions to the free energies of high-@xmath2 bcc and fcc mo can be neglected ; and second , that the first - principles statistical - mechanical techniques that were employed have the precision needed to distinguish between the possibly rather similar melting curves of bcc and other stuctures .",
    "there is also the question of whether fcc can remain vibrationally stable at high  @xmath2 in the region @xmath15  gpa , where the harmonic phonons are unstable .",
    "these are the issues addressed in the present paper .",
    "we use two methods here for comparing the free energies of the bcc and other crystal structures , and both methods fully include anharmonicity .",
    "the other structures we examine are fcc and hexagonal - close - packed ( hcp ) .",
    "the first method uses the fact that the free energy difference between two systems that differ only by a finite strain can be obtained by integrating the thermal average stress with respect to strain .",
    "@xcite we use this idea to obtain the free energy difference between fcc and bcc , which can be transformed into each other by a continuous strain along the bain path ( bp ) .",
    "the second method employs thermodynamic integration ( ti ) from a harmonic reference system to the fully anharmonic system described by dft .",
    "this is essentially the same method as we employed in earlier work on fe .  @xcite as further ways of probing the possible thermodynamic stability of the fcc structure , we have re - examined the melting curve of fcc mo , using the reference coexistence technique employed in some of our earlier work ,  @xcite and we have also performed our own first - principles z - method calculations on the melting of bcc and fcc mo . all the results point to the conclusion that none of the other structures is thermodynamically more stable than bcc at high  @xmath2 .",

    "[ sec : harmonic ] , we summarise briefly the technical details of the dft methods employed in all the calculations , and we then present our results for the harmonic dispersion relations of the bcc , fcc and hcp structures over a wide range of @xmath0 ; we note the pressure thresholds below which the fcc and hcp structures become harmonically unstable . in the same section",

    "but in order for this to be true , several conditions must be satisfied .",
    "first , since the lower shock transition occurs at @xmath87  gpa , which is far below the harmonic stability limit for both fcc and hcp , the system must somehow be vibrationally stabilised , presumably by anharmonic effects .",
    "second , the system must remain elastically stable at pressures @xmath88  gpa , i.e. small , arbitrary volume - conserving strains must not cause the free energy to decrease .",
    "third , the crystal structures must have lower free energies than bcc . vibrational stability can be tested by straightforward first - principles md simulations , as has been shown in our earlier work on high-@xmath0/high-@xmath2 bcc fe ,  @xcite and in recent work by asker _",
    "_ on low-@xmath0 fcc mo ;  @xcite we report tests here for fcc mo .",
    "the strain dependence of free energy can be also probed by md calculations in which the thermal average stress is monitored . for the case of fcc , calculation of stress as a function of strain along the bain path also allows us to test its thermodynamic stability .",
    "when we say that a crystal in thermal equilibrium is vibrationally stable , we mean that the thermal average position of each atom remains centred on its pefect - lattice site , and does not acquire a permanent deviation away from that site . to test this , it is convenient to use the so - called position correlation function @xmath83 , defined by :  @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the position of atom @xmath91 at time @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the perfect - lattice position of the atom , @xmath94 is an arbitrary time origin , and @xmath95 denotes the thermal average . in practice , the thermal average is performed by averaging over @xmath94 and over atoms . at @xmath96 , @xmath83 is simply the vibrational mean square displacement .",
    "the crystal is vibrationally stable if @xmath97 , because the vibrational displacements at widely separated times become uncorrelated .",
    "but if atoms acquire a permanent vibrational displacement , then @xmath98 becomes non - zero .",
    "the characteristic behaviour of @xmath83 in a vibrationally unstable crystal can be seen in our earlier work on high-@xmath0/high-@xmath2 fe in the bcc structure .",
    "@xcite for this test to work , the atoms must not diffuse from one site to another , and we routinely test for lack of diffusion by monitoring the time - dependent mean square displacement @xmath99 .    we have performed a set of first - principles md simulations on mo in the bcc and fcc structures at a wide range of thermodynamic states . a typical md run consisted of @xmath100 steps performed with a time - step of @xmath6  fs , with the first 5  ps allowed for equilibration , and only the last 5  ps used to accumulate statistical averages .",
    "the simulation cell contained @xmath101 particles for both fcc and bcc structures and @xmath102-point electronic @xmath22-point sampling was used .",

    "the idea is that if an md simulation is performed at constant total energy @xmath222 and volume @xmath30 ( microcanonical ensemble ) starting from the perfect crystal ( all atoms on regular - lattice sites ) , then after the solid has thermally equilibrated at some temperature @xmath223 it will subsequently melt only if @xmath223 exceeds a superheating limit @xmath224 .",

    "@xmath229 ) with specified density @xmath230 , and for each value of total energy ( equivalently , for each equilibrated solid temperature @xmath223 ) , we performed several hundred statistically independent simulations differing only in the random velocities assigned at the start of the simulation .",
    "the key conclusions were that ( a )  @xmath227 is a stochastic quantity having a roughly exponential probability distribution ; ( b )  its mean value @xmath231 lengthens rapidly as @xmath232 , being roughly proportional to @xmath233 ; ( c )  @xmath231 also increases as the size of the system decreases , the dependence being roughly @xmath234 .",

    "this means that if @xmath7 is estimated by performing simulations of fixed length @xmath235 and seeking the lowest @xmath223 and @xmath225 for which melting is observed , then @xmath225 will inevitably overestimate @xmath7 , and the overestimation will become worse as the system size is reduced . as an indication of the difficulties , the results of ref",

    "we have performed our own dft z - method simulations on bcc and fcc mo , using systems of 250 atoms for bcc and 256 atoms for fcc and simulation times of at least @xmath238  ps ( these are greater than the typical values used in ref .   by factors of @xmath239 and 4 respectively ) .",

    "@xcite and zeng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite however , we find that anharmonic contributions to the free energy substantially change the picture .",
    "our most direct evidence for this in the case of fcc comes from thermodynamic integration along the bain path , which indicates that fcc is thermodynamically less stable than bcc in the region where harmonic theory predicts the opposite ; furthermore , fcc appears to be elastically unstable at high  @xmath2 and @xmath175  gpa .",
    "the bain - path approach has the attractive feature that it relies only on completely standard first - principles md , and the calculations are easily repeatable by other researchers .",
    "the existence of large anharmonic contributions , which crucially change the high-@xmath2 stability of fcc and hcp relative to bcc , is confirmed by our explicit calculation of these contributions .",
    "further confirmation that fcc is thermodynamically less stable than bcc at high  @xmath2 comes from our comparison of the fcc and bcc melting curves .    at first sight , it might seem unexpected that anharmonicity stabilises bcc more than fcc and hcp .",
    "after all , fcc and hcp are the structures that go harmonically unstable at @xmath15  gpa , and intuition might suggest that below this pressure there could be large , anharmonically stabilised vibrations , which would have a large entropy .",
    "however , we have seen that the fcc structure at high  @xmath2 is not vibrationally unstable , at least with the sizes of simulation cell that we have used , so presumably phonons that would be harmonically unstable are stiffened by anharmonic effects , so that their entropy is actually reduced . in fact ,",
    "_ have shown recently that electronic thermal excitations have the effect of increasing the phonon frequencies of fcc mo ( see fig .  2 in ref .  [ ] ) . furthermore , electronic thermal excitations appear also to further stabilize the bcc structure over fcc . as we know from previous work ,",
    "the general effect of high  @xmath2 is to smooth the peaks and valleys of the zero - temperature electronic dos .",
    "however , in the bcc structure the population of electronic states on the region near the fermi energy is enhanced while in the fcc structure it is depleted .",
    "this has the overall effect of enhancing the electronic entropy of the bcc structure with respect to that of fcc .",
    "a similar argument has already been suggested by asker _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for explaining the stability properties of mo at low  @xmath0 and high  @xmath2 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in a recent study where we have developed a tight - binding model for mo based on dft data and used it to calculate anharmonic free energies over wide @xmath109 intervals , no stabilization of the fcc structure over bcc is observed .",
    "@xcite the effect of anharmonicity on the thermodynamic functions of the closely analogous element w has been discussed recently by ozolins .",
    "@xcite    our finding that the fcc melting curve is below the bcc curve , supported by our own z - method calculations , is not consistent with the mo melting curves deduced by belonoshko _",
    "_  @xcite from their z - method work .",
    "we have noted that one of the difficulties faced by the z method concerns time scales .",
    "when the temperature @xmath223 of the initially thermalised crystal exceeds the superheating limit @xmath224 , then in constant - energy md the system will eventually melt , but the waiting time @xmath227 before this occurs may be tens of ps or even more if @xmath223 is near @xmath224 , so that long simulations are needed if the method is to be reliable .",
    "@xcite the time - scale problem appears to become worse for small systems .",
    "the evidence we have presented indicates that the simulation times of only @xmath221  ps used in the earlier z - method work  @xcite were too short to yield reliable results .",
    "the longer simulations of at least @xmath238  ps that we use here should give better results , but even so the bcc melting temperature that we obtain is a significant overestimate compared with the values from our reference - coexistence calculations .",
    "it would clearly be desirable to repeat the z - method calculations with still longer runs on larger systems .",
    "however , the present simulations do serve the useful purpose of showing that the z - method predictions for the relative melting temperatures of bcc and fcc mo can be consistent with our much more extensive and detailed results from free - energy calculations .    the very recent dac work of dewaele _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the melting of ta makes it clear that very careful attention must be paid to experimental procedures if reliable results are to be obtained for high-@xmath0/high-@xmath2 phase boundaries , and we believe that a cautious attitude should be adopted towards the existing dac evidence  @xcite for low melting curves in high-@xmath0 mo .",
    "nevertheless , the shock data on mo seem to require a crystallographic boundary somewhere in the region where quasiharmonic calculations indicate a transition from bcc to fcc or hcp . when we began the present work",
    ", we did not expect that the inclusion of anharmonicity would cause the bcc - fcc and bcc - hcp boundaries to disappear .",
    "because we were initially sceptical of our findings , we felt it essential to confirm them in the ways that we have described .",
    "our current belief is that efforts should be continued to search for other candidate crystal structures which might be thermodynamically more stable than bcc in the high-@xmath0/high-@xmath2 region .    in conclusion",
    ", our results suggest that the high-@xmath0/high@xmath2 solid phase of mo indicated by shock experiments is not fcc or hcp , but we do not rule out the possibility of other stable high-@xmath2 crystal phases .",

    "<S> we use first - principles techniques to re - examine the suggestion that transitions seen in high-@xmath0 experiments on mo are solid - solid transitions from the bcc structure to either the fcc or hcp structures . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that in the harmonic approximation the free energies of fcc and hcp structures become lower than that of bcc at @xmath1  gpa and @xmath2 below the melting curve , as reported recently . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that if anharmonic effects are fully included this is no longer true . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate fully anharmonic free energies of high-@xmath2 crystal phases by integration of the thermal average stress with respect to strain as structures are deformed into each other , and also by thermodynamic integration from harmonic reference systems to the fully anharmonic system . </S>",
    "<S> our finding that fcc is thermodynamically less stable than bcc in the relevant high-@xmath0/high-@xmath2 region is supported by comparing the melting curves of the two structures calculated using the first - principles reference - coexistence technique . </S>",
    "<S> we present first - principles simulations based on the recently proposed z method which also support the stability of bcc over fcc . </S>"
