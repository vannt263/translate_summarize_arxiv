    "jupiter and saturn played a key role in the formation of the solar system . yet",
    "their internal structure and composition are still poorly known .",
    "this is due to the fact that the only way to probe the deep regions of these planets is by calculating interior models matching their observed gravitational field , a method that can only yield information on quantities that are averaged over a significant fraction of the planetary radius .",
    "it is however of primordial importance to derive the largest ensemble of theoretical models compatible with observations , and yet to try to narrow down the ensemble of solutions as much as possible , thus providing related scientific fields with useful constraints .",
    "previous work on the subject , including those of hubbard & marley ( 1989 ) , zharkov & gudkova ( 1992 ) , chabrier et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and guillot et al .",
    "( 1994b ) , has generally aimed at finding a sample of models matching the observational constraints , i.e. radius and gravitational moments . using the new h / he mixing ratio from galileo and taking advantage of the improvements in computing capabilities over the past years , guillot et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have calculated an extended ensemble of interior models of jupiter matching all observational constraints within the error bars .    although new observations of saturn relevant to studies of its internal structure will probably have to await the arrival of the cassini - huygens space mission in 2004 , the present article is motivated by the renewed interest in giant planet formation subsequent to the discovery of extrasolar planets ( see e.g. mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy and butler 1998 ) . as a consequence , the formation of giant planets by gas instability ( cameron 1978 ) , which had been abandoned to the profit of the nucleated instability model ( lissauer 1993 , pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) , has reborn from its ashes , and been proposed as a mechanism that led to the rapid formation of jupiter and saturn ( boss 1998 ) .",
    "this prompts for a recalculation of models of saturn aimed at constraining its internal composition .    furthermore , accurate evolution calculations ( guillot et al . 1995 ) using improved atmospheric models ( marley et al . 1996 ; burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) were available , but assumed a homogeneous structure .",
    "the additional energy provided by helium sedimentation ( or that of any other element ) has been estimated by hubbard et al .",
    "the resulting model ages therefore provide an additional constraint , as they must , within the uncertainties , agree with the age of the solar system .",
    "the aim of the present article is thus to calculate new static models of saturn , to include additional constraints obtained from evolution calculations on the models of jupiter and saturn , and to compare the structure and composition of the two giant planets .",
    "relevant observations and input physics are presented in section  2 .",
    "the main assumption of a three layer structure for jupiter and saturn is discussed in section  3 .",
    "i then present in the next section the method used to calculate interior models .",
    "the results are detailed in section  5 ; their consequences on models of the formation of the giant planets and perspectives are discussed in section  6 .",
    "jupiter and saturn are rapid rotators : the rotation rates derived from their magnetic fields are 9 hours and 55 minutes , and 10 hours and 39 minutes , respectively .",
    "although the consequences of rotation on their very structure , and in particular the presence and strength of convection in their interiors , are difficult to assess ( stevenson and salpeter 1977 ; see also busse 1976 , zhang & schubert 1996 ) , this property is a chance because it allows us to constrain their interior density profiles , by measuring the departures from sphericity of their gravitational potentials : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant , @xmath27 the mass of the planet , @xmath28 its equatorial radius , @xmath29 the distance to the planetary center , @xmath30 the polar angle ( to the rotation axis ) , and @xmath31 are legendre polynomials .",
    "the @xmath32 are the gravitational moments .",
    "their observed values ( inferred mostly from the trajectories of the pioneer and voyager spacecrafts ) are given in table  [ tab : grav ] .",
    "the gravitational moments can also be related to the internal density profile @xmath33 ( and thus to theoretical models ) by the following relation ( e.g. , zharkov & trubitsyn 1974 ) : @xmath34 in which the integral is calculated over the total volume of the planet . a common method for the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : j2i ] is the so - called theory of figures , which will not be developed here ( see zharkov & trubitsyn 1978 ) . the present work uses equations to the third order of the theory of figures .",

    "observations of the atmospheric winds show significant variations with latitude , however ( e.g. , gierasch & conrath 1993 ) .",
    "the question of the depth to which these differential rotation patterns extend is still open .",
    "hubbard ( 1982 ) has proposed a solution to the planetary figure problem in the case of a deep rotation field that possesses cylindrical symmetry .",
    "it is thus possible to derive , from interior models assuming solid rotation , the value of the gravitational moments that the planet would have if its surface rotation pattern extended deep into its interior .",
    "it is _ a priori _ impossible to prefer one model to the other , and i will therefore present calculations assuming both solid and differential rotation .",
    "table  [ tab : grav ] gives both the measured gravitational moments , and those corrected for differential rotation .",
    "the following definitions for chemical abundances will be used : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the mass mixing ratios of hydrogen , helium , and heavy elements , respectively . because it is difficult to separate helium and heavy elements",
    ", i also introduce an _ equivalent _ helium mass mixing ratio , @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : z ] hereafter for an exact derivation ) .",
    "a first indicator of the internal evolution of the giant planets is the abundance of helium in their atmospheres .",
    "since the helium to hydrogen ratio in the whole planet must have remained constant for its entire evolution , any measured depletion in the atmosphere compared to the initial value means that more helium is present deeper inside the planet .",
    "this has significant consequences on the planet s internal structure and evolution .",
    "unfortunately , the initial ( i.e. , protosolar ) helium mass mixing ratio can not be directly inferred from abundance measurements in the solar photosphere because of the progressive gravitational settling of helium into the radiative zone of our star . instead , determination of the protosolar value must rely on solar evolution models including diffusion and satisfaction of the constraints provided by observations of solar oscillations .",
    "these indicate that the protosolar helium mass mixing ratio was @xmath45 ( bahcall & pinsonneault 1995 ) .    in situ measurements of that quantity in jupiter yield @xmath46 ( von zahn et al .",
    "combined radio occultation measurements and spectra analysis indicate that , in saturn , @xmath47 ( conrath et al . 1984 ) . however , similar measurements for jupiter led to @xmath48 ( gautier et al .",
    "1982 ) , in disagreement with the value obtained by the galileo probe .",
    "it is conceivable that the value obtained for saturn is incorrect too , prompting us to consider other values for the atmospheric helium mixing ratio in that planet .",
    "indeed , both a reexamination of voyager iris data ( gautier & conrath , personal communication 1998 ) and constraints from the static and evolutionary models ( see below , and accompanying paper by hubbard et al . 1999 ) point to significantly higher values of @xmath42 . in any case , the conclusion that more helium was present in the protosolar nebula gas from which jupiter and saturn formed than is observed today in their atmospheres seems inescapable .",
    "this is explained by the presence of either a first order molecular / metallic phase transition of hydrogen , or a hydrogen / helium phase separation , or both , as described below .",
    "the measured abundances of other elements also provide important clues to the composition of the planets .",
    "both jupiter and saturn are globally enriched in heavy elements compared to the sun . in jupiter ,",
    "the _ in situ _ measurements of the galileo probe are compatible with a @xmath493 times solar enrichment of carbon and sulfur ( niemann et al .",
    "it is still unclear as to whether nitrogen is close to solar ( by a factor 1 to 1.5 ; de pater and massie 1985 ) , moderately ( 2.2 to 2.4 ; carlson et al . 1992 ) or strongly enriched ( 3.5 to 4.5 times solar ; folkner et al .",
    "water is still a problem because of its condensation at deep levels , and only a lower limit of @xmath490.1 times solar can be inferred from the measurements . on the contrary , neon , and perhaps argon",
    "appear to be depleted , having abundances less than 0.13 and 1.7 times solar , respectively ( niemann et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this might be due to the fact that noble gases , in particular neon , tend to be carried deep into the interior by helium - rich droplets ( roulston & stevenson 1995 ) .    unfortunately , the uncertainties for saturn are still relatively large .",
    "its atmosphere is enhanced in carbon by a factor of 2 to 7 , and in nitrogen by a factor 2 or more ( gautier & owen 1989 ) .",
    "observationally , it could therefore be more rich in heavy elements than the jovian atmosphere . this will be tested by the cassini - huygens mission .",
    "the temperatures at the tropopause ( at pressures of about 0.3 bar ) are relatively well constrained by direct inversions of infrared spectra .",
    "these predict relatively large latitudinal temperature changes of the order of 10 k ( conrath et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the temperature gradients decrease with tropospheric depth , as interior convection presumably becomes more efficient in redistributing the heat .",
    "however , the accuracy of this method drops rapidly with increasing pressure and does not reach levels deep enough to be used as surface condition for interior models .",
    "so far , the only reliable measurement of the deep tropospheric temperature of a giant planet is that from the galileo probe in jupiter : 166 k at 1 bar ( seiff et al .",
    "it is not clear however how representative of the whole planet this measurement is .",
    "previous analyses have relied upon ( local ) radio occultation data acquired with the pioneer and voyager spacecrafts ( lindal et al . 1981 , 1985 )",
    "that predicted 1 bar temperatures of @xmath50 k in jupiter and @xmath51k in saturn .",
    "the temperatures inferred from these data are however dependent on the assumed mean molecular weight @xmath52 . in the case of a vertically uniform atmospheric composition ( a fairly accurate representation in the present case )",
    ", one can derive the temperature directly from the measured refractivity @xmath53 as a function of altitude @xmath54 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the gravity and @xmath57 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the new measurement of the helium mixing ratio in jupiter yields a higher @xmath52 , and hence a larger surface temperature of 170.4 k at 1 bar . on the other hand",
    ", the interpretation of the iris data suggests that the radio occultation data tend to predict temperatures that are too high by a few kelvins ( gautier , personal communication 1998 ) , therefore pointing to a value closer to 165 k. in this work , i choose to consider values of 165 to 170 k for jupiter .    in the case of saturn",
    ", i will show that values of @xmath42 higher than the voyager value ( @xmath58 ) , are more in agreement with the evolution of this planet , and that the surface helium mass mixing ratio could be as high as 0.25 . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : tz ] , these high values indicate that the planet s surface temperature might be significantly underestimated , and be of the order of 145 k , a value that i choose to use in the calculations .",
    "i also present calculations with 1 bar temperatures of 135 k. the lower limit of 130 k appears to be inconsistent with the static and evolutionary constraints and is therefore not used .      inside jupiter and saturn ,",
    "all chemical species are compressed to very high pressures ( up to 10 - 70 mbar ) at temperatures for which experimental data are difficult to obtain , and theoretical models very complex .",
    "hydrogen undergoes a transition from a molecular phase at low pressures to a metallic phase at pressures larger than about one mbar .",
    "yet it is still unclear whether this transition is discontinuous ( first order ) or continuous .    to date",
    ", the most thorough theoretical effort to model the high - pressure , low - temperature liquid hydrogen equation of state ( eos ) predicts that this element passes from molecular to metallic phase via a first order ( i.e. discontinuous ) plasma phase transition ( ppt ) ( saumon et al .",
    "this eos is however based on the so - called `` chemical picture '' which assumes that the species considered ( h , h@xmath59 , h@xmath60 , h@xmath61 ) are chemically distinct under all conditions .",
    "this assumption is probably not entirely satisfied in the region of interest , and hence , saumon et al .",
    "( 1995 ) provide two eoss : a thermodynamically consistent one , which includes the ppt , and one that has been smoothly interpolated between low - pressure and high - pressure regimes .",
    "these two eoss ( referred to as `` ppt - eos '' and `` @xmath62-eos '' hereafter ) are used in this work and serve as an estimate of present uncertainties on the calculated densities of hydrogen at high pressure .",
    "recent shock compression on liquid deuterium ( e.g. , holmes et al .",
    "1995 ; weir et al . 1996",
    "; collins et al . 1998 ) show that the molecular / metallic transition is even more complex than was expected . at pressures of about 1.4 mbar ,",
    "the resistivity of the liquid ceases to decrease , which is interpreted as the sign that the metal phase has been reached , thus favoring the case for a continuous molecular to metallic transition ( nellis et al .",
    "1999 ; da silva et al .",
    "1997 ) . however , the measured resistivity is still larger than theoretical estimates pertaining to a fully - ionized metal ( hubbard et al .",
    "1997 ) . as discussed by nellis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , in the @xmath63 mbar pressure range , the transition is from a semi - conducting to an essentially metallic fluid but one which retains a strong pairing character .",
    "as these authors note , `` the precise mechanism by which a metallic state might be attained is still a matter of debate '' .",
    "one proposition is that the ppt exists , but lies deeper still ( saumon et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the complex behavior of hydrogen due to the molecular / metallic transition probably extends over the range @xmath64 mbar indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : jupsat ] hereafter .",
    "helium is the source of yet another difficulty : its behavior would be simpler than that of hydrogen , since it requires larger pressures to become ionized , were it not for its interactions with hydrogen atoms and molecules , and the subsequent possibility that a phase _ separation _ between helium - rich and helium - poor mixtures occurs in jupiter and saturn ( salpeter 1973 ) . to date , no fully consistent equation of state including",
    "both hydrogen and helium has been made available .",
    "attempts to predict the critical pressures and temperatures at which helium separates from hydrogen still yield very different results ( pfaffenzeller et al .",
    "1995 ; klepeis et al .",
    "1991 ) but generally agree that this should take place in the metallic region ( see also stevenson 1982 ) .",
    "i choose to consider this phase separation as a possibility , but do not attempt to derive a consistent phase - diagram .",
    "instead , in the framework of the saumon - chabrier eos , helium is added to hydrogen using the ideal mixing rule ( thereby preventing any derivation of gibbs mixing enthalpy ) .",
    "heavier elements are present in smaller quantities , so that errors on their eoss should not lead to substantial changes in the final interior models . their contribution is derived from the ideal mixing rule , with the assumption that their eos is proportional to that of helium , with a factor equal to the ratio between the molecular mass of helium and heavy elements . however , contrary to previous work ( see chabrier et al .",
    "1992 , guillot et al . 1994b , 1997 )",
    ", i account for their specific heat , as it is significantly different from that of helium .",
    "the additional entropy due to the presence of heavy elements is derived within the perfect gas formalism .",
    "this is clearly an oversimplification , but this term is only significant in the molecular phase and not in the partly degenerate metallic phase , for which density is less sensitive to temperature changes .",
    "accordingly , the specific entropy of the gas at any given temperature and pressure is written : @xmath65 , \\label{eq : s}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the entropies for pure hydrogen and helium , respectively , @xmath68 is the entropy of mixture of these two species ( see saumon et al .",
    "1995 ) , @xmath69 is the ( mean ) molecular mass of the heavy elements , @xmath70 their specific heat ( in units of @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are arbitrary reference temperature and pressure , respectively .",
    "i use @xmath74 and @xmath75 as typical values .",
    "different values were tested without significantly changing the results .",
    "in fact , most of the difference with previous calculations is the result of the use of @xmath42 ( i.e. in the molecular envelope , the observed helium mass mixing ratio ) instead of the equivalent helium mass fraction @xmath76 in eq .",
    "[ eq : s ] ( see guillot et al .",
    "note that in the molecular envelope , in which the temperature profile is most important , helium is in atomic form and has the smallest possible specific heat . the use of eq .",
    "[ eq : s ] is thus especially important for saturn , whose molecular envelope is rich in heavy elements .",
    "the resulting models of this planet are substantially cooler than previous ones .    in the central cores of the planets ,",
    "i use the density relations appropriate to `` ices '' ( a mixture of ch@xmath77 , nh@xmath78 , and h@xmath59o ) and `` rocks '' ( fe , ni , mgo and sio@xmath59 ) , as described by hubbard & marley ( 1989 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho_z ] compares different pressure - temperature profiles for jupiter and saturn , using the various equations of state described here .",
    "the figure is intended to provide an estimate of the uncertainties on the various equations of state ( hydrogen - helium , heavy elements ) .",
    "it is important to notice at this point that saturn s interior lies mostly in a relatively well - known region of the hydrogen - helium eos , i.e. in which hydrogen is molecular , whereas a significant fraction of jupiter s interior is at intermediate pressures ( one to a few mbar ) for which the eos is most uncertain .",
    "although most of the interiors of jupiter and saturn are convectively unstable , some regions have been recognized to be potentially _",
    "stable_. at temperatures of the order of 1500 to 2000 k , a minimum of the rosseland mean opacity ( see , e.g. , clayton 1968 for a definition ) is responsible for the likely presence of a radiative region in jupiter , and perhaps saturn ( guillot et al .",
    "much closer to the visible part of the atmospheres of these planets , the underabundance of some compounds , in particular water , may yield stable regions as well ( see guillot et al .",
    "1994a ; fig.5 ) .",
    "those may however not cover the entire surface of the planet at a given level . instead ,",
    "2- and 3-dimensional effects are to be expected due to meteorological phenomena .",
    "the presence of radiative regions has major consequences on both static and evolution models of the giant planets : it yields significantly cooler interiors ( guillot et al .",
    "1994b ) , and quickens their evolution ( guillot et al . 1995 ) .",
    "it is therefore of prime importance to calculate accurate radiative opacities . in this work ,",
    "i use a simplified opacity calculation , using the method described in guillot et al .",
    "( 1994a ) , and updated absorption data for water , methane , h@xmath59s ( see marley et al . 1996 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "the results of these preliminary calculations are presented in table  [ tab : opa ] , for a 3 times solar mixture .",
    "they are however much improved compared to previous calculations ( guillot et al .",
    "1994a ) : as expected , including hot bands of water increased the opacity by as much as a factor 3 in some places , thereby significantly diminishing the extent and consequences of jupiter s and saturn s inner radiative zones . in the case of saturn ,",
    "the present models show no radiative zone , or a very limited one .",
    "the detailed study of the new absorption data on the presence and magnitude of the radiative zone will however have to await a more detailed calculation of an extended rosseland opacity table ( freedman , personal communication 1999 ) .",
    ".rosseland opacities ( log@xmath79 , in g@xmath80 ) [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     in this section , better constraints are sought from evolution models , which are described in detail in the companion paper by hubbard et al .",
    "model ages assuming _ homogeneous _ evolutions ( see guillot et al .",
    "1995 ) , and corrected for the variable solar luminosity are given in table  [ tab : evol ] .",
    "compared to the age of the solar system , 4.55 gyr , jupiter and saturn formed on a relatively short time scale , at most 0.02 gyr ( e.g. , pollack et al . 1996 ) .",
    "any difference between the ages in table  [ tab : evol ] and that of the solar system has therefore to be explained by either uncertainties inherent to the evolution calculations ( probably less than 0.3 gyr ) , or by physical phenomena , among which differentiation appears to be the most likely .",
    "the time delay due to helium differentiation can be estimated by the following relation ( see hubbard et al .",
    "1999 ) : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is in gyr , and @xmath83 could represent the differentiation of either helium or any other elements ( e.g. , water , if it is abundant enough ) .",
    "one can see that a negative @xmath83 would yield a faster evolution , as heavy elements are then transported upward against gravity , thereby consuming some of the internal luminosity . however , this situation is extremely unlikely , as this would mean that helium differentiation would be more than balanced by that of other elements , which _ a priori _ are less abundant .",
    "i therefore assume that @xmath83 is positive .",
    "some of the models of table  [ tab : evol ] , in particular the adiabatic ppt - eos jupiter evolution models , are thus incompatible with the age of the solar system .",

    "it is noteworthy that a high @xmath106 value necessitates that saturn s metallic envelope be richer in heavy elements than its molecular envelope .",
    "this presumably would indicate the absence of a global mixing of the planetary interior throughout its evolution , the inner regions , which formed early , having been impacted by many more planetesimals in the early protoplanetary phases than the final planet itself .",
    "an interesting side result concerns the values of @xmath107 and @xmath19 obtained assuming solid rotation ( only the _ measured _ observational moments have been adjusted for differential rotation ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : j4j6 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath107 were constrained to be within the observational error bars , but it can be seen that , both in the case of jupiter and saturn , the models with the additional evolution constraint ( large symbols ) are generally in better agreement with a solid internal rotation than with a surface differential rotation extending deep in the interior ( hubbard 1982 ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the measurements are however still too large to be conclusive .",
    "again , more accurate @xmath107 measurements may resolve the issue of the presence of a core , as models with no core always possess smaller @xmath108 .    from jupiter to saturn , a close proportionality relation links @xmath19 to @xmath107 , almost independently of any assumed uncertainty ( on the equation of state , temperature profile , condensation of heavy elements",
    "... etc . ) .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the uncertainties on the density profile in the external layers are rather small , and these profiles are continuous .",
    "the theoretical values for @xmath19 are between 0.35 and @xmath21 for jupiter , and between 0.9 and @xmath23 for saturn .",
    "these values are thus defined with a precision which is about 10 times larger than the current observational uncertainties .",
    "should measurements point to different values of @xmath19 , major changes in interior models would have to be found , probably invoking significant departures from the three - layer assumption , and/or very peculiar differential rotation patterns .",
    "for example , an abstract by bosh ( 1994 ) states that a more accurate value of @xmath19 can be obtained for saturn by constraints added by measurements of the position of non - circular ringlets of the planet .",
    "the thus inferred value ( adjusted to the 1bar equatorial radius given in table  [ tab : grav ] ) , @xmath109 , is incompatible with all interior models presented here .",
    "this has also been verified by gudkova & zharkov ( 1997 ) .",
    "measurements by the cassini orbiter should provide accurate measurements of @xmath107 and @xmath19 , and therefore test interior models .",
    "it also has been proposed that a jupiter close orbiter would allow the precise determination of the planet s gravitational moments up to a relatively high order ( @xmath110 ) , and would thus constrain the deep internal rotation ( hubbard 1999 ) .",
    "such a mission would also provide an excellent test of interior models of jupiter .",
    "the measurement of the deuterium to hydrogen isotopic ratio in the giant planets could be a powerful way to determine the abundance of ices in their interiors , as this isotopic ratio @xmath111 is , in the interstellar medium , higher in ices ( hdo / h@xmath59o ) than in hydrogen ( hd / h@xmath59 ) .",
    "the giant planets are expected to contain slightly more deuterium than the protosolar value @xmath112 , in proportion to their enrichment in heavy elements ( hubbard and macfarlane 1980 ; lcluse et al .",
    "1996 ) : @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the masses of the hydrogen and water reservoirs , respectively , that were allowed to exchange their deuterium , and @xmath116 is the deuterium ratio in water whose assumed value , 300ppm , is representative of that found in comets so far ( bockele - morvan et al .",
    "other compounds may also have a small contribution to the deuterium enrichment but are neglected .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsurh ] compares the d / h ratios measured on jupiter ( mahaffy et al .",
    "1998 ) and saturn ( griffin et al . , 1996 ) to the theoretical values estimated from the interior models matching both the gravitational and evolution constraints .",
    "two theoretical calculations were performed for each planet , one for which the total amount of ices was allowed to exchange its deuterium with the hydrogen reservoir , another for which the core was kept separated from the envelope ( i.e. material in the core never mixed with the hydrogen in the envelope , even during the formation of the planets ) .",
    "the mass of water ( and other deuterium - carriers ) that contributed to the heavy element content of the giant planets was supposed to lie between 1/2 and 2/3 of the total mass of heavy elements now present in these planets . as a result , even if jupiter and saturn have been enriched in deuterium by ices with relatively high d / h ratios , this enrichment is still too small to be detected , given the large observational error bars .",
    "a better observational determination of the deuterium abundances in jupiter and saturn is to be sought .",
    "if measured with an accuracy of the order of 1ppm , a comparison of the values obtained for the two planets would allow an estimate of the deuterium content of the primordial ice carriers , thus testing the hypothesis that ices that formed planetesimals vaporized and had time to exchange their deuterium in the hot early protosolar nebula ( drouart et al .",
    "constraints on the internal structure and composition of jupiter and saturn have been derived within the framework of the three - layer model . for the first time , constraints from both the planets gravitational fields and their evolution have been used .",
    "the uncertainties of the result are still large , mostly because of our limited knowledge of the behavior of hydrogen and of hydrogen / helium mixtures at pressures greater that 1 mbar .    yet",
    "interior models indicate that both jupiter and saturn are enriched in heavy elements compared to the sun ( or , equivalently , the protosolar nebula ) . how the planets acquired these additional heavy elements",
    "is still a mystery .",
    "unfortunately , a comparison of core masses and amounts of heavy elements in jupiter and saturn is still inconclusive .",
    "most importantly , it is not yet possible to decide which of jupiter and saturn possesses the largest absolute quantity of elements other than hydrogen and helium .    from this work , one can not rule out either core accretion or gaseous instability as valid formation mechanisms for jupiter .",
    "uncertainties on the hydrogen equation of state greatly affect the accuracy of the results obtained for that planet , and both a low and a high heavy elements content ( which , presumably would be incompatible with a rapid formation of the planet , as its capture radius would become small on time scales shorter than 1 myr ) are possible .    in the case of saturn , constraints from the interior and evolution models , indicate that a significant fraction of the heavy elements lie in the dense core and in the metallic envelope .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with the formation of this planet by gaseous instability .",
    "although , it will be difficult to accurately determine the structure of the interiors of jupiter and saturn in the foreseeable future , progress is to be expected from high pressure experiments on liquid hydrogen ( or deuterium ) and the corresponding theoretical improvements on the equation of state of that material , from better determinations of saturn s helium abundance in its atmosphere , from measurements of the high order gravitational moments ( beginning with @xmath107 ) in jupiter and saturn , and from theoretical improvements on opacity data and non - homogeneous evolution models including hydrogen / helium phase separation .",
