    "cobe ( the cosmic background explorer satellite ) is nasa s first cosmological satellite . the spectacular results and success cobe provided stimulation to the field and to everyone s imagination which has resulted in the world s space agencies being open to future missions that promise to revolutionize and quantify our view of the universe .",
    "cobe has also provided us with confidence in the big bang model of cosmology and our ability to test variants of the big bang models and determine their parameters with precision .",
    "cobe also determined two of those parameters remarkable well in a field characterized by uncertainty in these parameters at the 50 to 100%  level .",
    "the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) was nasa s first cosmological satellite and had a number of significant results :    * full sky maps at 14 frequencies * cosmic microwave background spectrum  precision measurements * cmb anisotropies  detection , observation , measurement * diffuse infrared background ",
    "detection , measurement * cmb polarization ",
    "significant upper limits    cobe , additionally , proved to be a training ground for approaches , techniques , and people .",
    "these included those of the cobe team and the external community which had good and timely access to the data .",
    "this lead to much scientific interest and activity .",
    "our current view of the data / signal flow and ultimate analysis and interpretation is very similar to that used on the cobe observations and analysis .",

    "the firas ( far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ) instrument has made a high precision observation of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "firas @xcite was built to measure the spectrum of diffuse emission from 1 to 100 , with particular attention to possible differences between the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and a blackbody spectrum as small as 0.1%  of the peak of the cmbr spectrum .",
    "the firas has differential inputs and outputs , a full beam external calibrator , a controllable reference blackbody , and a polarizing michelson interferometer with bolometer detectors .",
    "it operated at a temperature of 1.5 k inside a liquid helium cryostat to suppress instrument emission and improve detector sensitivities .",
    "firas improves upon previous measurements in reducing the potential contributions of the systematic errors by : 1 ) operating outside the atmosphere ; 2 ) providing full aperture _ in situ _ calibration ; 3 ) providing a continuous differential comparison with a reference blackbody adjusted to null the input signal ; 4 ) operating the entire instrument , including the beam forming optics , in a shielded environment at cryogenic temperatures ; and 5 ) using an improved horn antenna with a flared aperture to define the beam and reduce the contributions from objects outside the main beam .",
    "these were possible in the context of a satellite mission .",
    "the ultimate result of the firas observations and analysis was a remarkable precise measurement of the cmb spectrum and comparison @xcite to that from a blackbody spectrum .",
    "the measured spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : spectrum ] and [ fig : tspectrum ] .",
    "the cmb spectrum would have a blackbody form if the simple , hot , big bang model is a correct description of the early universe , but will be distorted from that form by energy release for a redshift @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "such releases might arise from decay of unstable particles , dissipation of cosmic turbulence and gravitational waves , breakdown of cosmic strings and other more exotic transformations .",
    "the cmb was the dominant energy field after the annihilation of positrons and the decoupling of neutrinos until @xmath2 . for energy release into the electron - proton plasma , between redshift of a few times @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite",
    "the number of compton scatterings is sufficient to bring the photons into thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma . during this time",
    ", bremsstrahlung and other radiative processes do not have enough time to add a sufficient amount of photons to create a planckian distribution .",
    "the resulting distribution is a bose - einstein spectrum with a chemical potential , @xmath5 , that is exponentially attenuated at low frequencies , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the frequency at which compton scattering of photons to higher frequencies is balanced by bremsstrahlung creation at lower frequencies @xcite ) . at redshifts smaller than @xmath8 ,",
    "the compton scattering rate is no longer high enough to produce a bose - einstein spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectrum has an increased brightness temperature in the far rayleigh - jeans region due to bremsstrahlung emission by relatively hot electrons , a reduced temperature in the middle rayleigh - jeans region where the photons are depleted by compton scattering , and a high temperature in the wien region where the compton - scattered photons have accumulated .",
    "these observations provide new limits on the following cosmological parameters : @xmath9  the thermodynamic temperature of the background radiation @xmath10  a measure of the effects of bremsstrahlung , unitless ; a.k.a . @xmath11",
    "y  a measure of the effects of compton scattering , unitless @xmath12  describes the bose - einstein distortion , unitless .",
    "the most complete fit is a nonlinear simultaneous fit of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , as shown in table [ tab : nonlinear ] , making use of all data published for the cmb monopole .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,^ , < , < \" , ]     the extragalactic background light consists of the cumulative emissions from various pregalactic objects , protogalaxies , galaxies , and clusters of galaxies summed over the evolution of the universe .",
    "much of the extragalactic background light is predicted to be manifested as the cosmic infrared background due to the process of absorption and reradiation by dust particles and by the general redshifting due to the expansion of the universe .",
    "theorists have anticipated that there are two major energy sources that contribute to the extragalactic background light : nuclear and gravitational . nuclear energy released in stellar nucleosynthesis",
    "is radiated predominantly in the ultraviolet to visible wavelengths and is either redshifted or absorbed and reradiated into the infrared ( @xmath15 m ) wavelength region .",
    "similarly , released gravitational energy is shifted toward longer wavelengths .",
    "the infrared is thus expected to contain a significant fraction of all the energy released in the universe since the recombination epoch .",
    "its observation then constrains the relative contribution of all potential energy sources .    the integrated cib intensity detected by cobe in the 140 - 1000  @xmath5 m wavelength range is about 16  nw  m@xmath16  sr@xmath17 .",
    "this intensity is consisentwith the energy release expected from nuclear energy sources and xonstitutes about 20% - 50%  of the total energy released in the formation of he and metals throughout the history of the universe .",
    "galaxy number counts provide a lower limit of 12  nw  m@xmath16  sr@xmath17 in the 0.36 to 2.2 .  @xmath5 m wavelength interval .",
    "the explored regions then account for a total intensity of 28  nw  m@xmath16  sr@xmath17 .",
    "if attributed to nuclear sources only , this intensity implies more than about 10%  of the baryonic mass density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis analysis has been processed in stars to he and heavier elements .",
    "this leaves little room for strong and exotic other sources of energy release through this epoch .",
    "conclusions : what we learned from cobe ?",
    "* a cosmology satellite can be wildly successful * a development of techniques and personnel * cmb spectrum very close to planckian * there are primordial perturbations / temperature anisotropies * gravitational instability is proper paradigm - normalization * the hot big bang model is strongly supported * the cmb polarization is small * the large - scale structure of space - time is simple * constraints on non - standard physics to early times * cib exists at an appropriate level    this work was funded in part by the director , office of energy research , office of high energy and nuclear physics , division of high energy physics of the u.s .",
