    "the experimental hep frontier is soon reaching tev energies and most of physicists expect that just there theoretically proposed higgs bosons and super partners are waiting to be discovered .",
    "there are many reasons to be so optimistic .",
    "first of all , in spite of its remarkable successes , the standard model has to be extended into a more complete theory which should solve the hierarchy problem and stabilize the higgs boson mass against radiative corrections . the most attractive extension to realize these objectives is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "its minimal version ( mssm ) requires a non - standard higgs sector @xcite which introduces additional sources of cp - violation@xcite beyond the @xmath1 phase @xcite .",
    "the plethora of cp - phases also influences the decays and mixings of b mesons ( as well as d and k mesons ) .",
    "the present experiments at babar , tevatron and kek and the one to start at the lhc will be able to measure various decay channels to determine if there are supersymmetric sources of cp violation . in particular , cp - asymmetry and decay rate of @xmath2 form a good testing ground for low - energy supersymmetry with cp violation @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned additional cp - phases explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry of the universe and the lightest susy particle could be an excellent candidate for cold dark matter in the universe @xcite .    in the case of exact supersymmetry",
    ", all scalar particles would have to have same masses with their associated sm partners .",
    "since none of the superpartners has been discovered , supersymmetry must be broken .",
    "but in order to preserve the hierarchy problem solved the supersymmetry must be broken softly .",
    "this leads to a reasonable mass splittings between known particles and their superpartners , i.e. to the superpartners masses around 1 tev .    the precision experiments by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite have put the following constraint on the relic density of cold dark matter which are based on 1st year data .",
    "now the wmap 3rd year data is also available @xcite , but the new wmap + sdss combined value for relic density of dark matter does not change the numerical results in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely the wmap - allowed bands .",
    "see `` note added '' section of ref . @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath3    recently , in the light of this cosmological constraint an extensive analysis of the neutralino relic density in the presence of susy - cp phases has been given by blanger _",
    "_ @xcite .    in this study",
    "we present the numerical investigation of the fermionic two - body decays of squarks in mssm with complex susy parameters .",
    "actually , we had performed a short study in this direction for the third family squarks @xcite incorporating all the existing bounds on the susy parameter space by utilizing the study by belanger et al .",
    "this investigation showed us that the effects of @xmath4 and its phase @xmath5 on the decay widths of @xmath6 and @xmath7 are quite significant .",
    "now we extend it to all three families .",
    "although the susy parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are in general complex , we assume that @xmath10 and @xmath9 are real , but @xmath4 and its phase @xmath5 take values on the wmap - allowed bands",
    ". these bands also satisfy the edm bounds @xcite .",
    "the experimental upper limits on the edms of electron , neutron and the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 atoms may impose constraints on the size of the susy cp - phases @xcite . however , these constraints are highly model dependent .",
    "this means that it is possible to suppress the edms without requiring the various susy cp - phases be small .",
    "for example , in the mssm assuming strong cancelations between different contributions @xcite , the phase of @xmath13 is restricted to @xmath14 , but there is no such restriction on the phases of @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we evaluate the parameter @xmath15 via the relation @xmath16 which can be derived by assuming gaugino mass unification purely in the electroweak sector of mssm .",
    "it is very important to insert the wmap - allowed band in the plane @xmath17 into the numerical calculations instead of taking one fixed @xmath4 value for all @xmath18-phases , because , for example , on the allowed band for @xmath19 gev , @xmath4 starts from 140 gev for @xmath20 and increasing monotonously it becomes 165 gev for @xmath21 .",
    "in ref.@xcite two wmap - allowed band plots are given , one for @xmath19 gev and the other for @xmath22 gev .",
    "for both plots the other parameters are fixed to be @xmath23 , @xmath24 tev , @xmath25 tev , @xmath26=@xmath27=0 .",
    "we here simply choose generic masses for squarks as @xmath28=1000 gev and @xmath29=750 gev ( q = u , d , c , s , t , b ) , although we had chosen more reasonable mass values in our previous note @xcite .",
    "taking different sets of values for squark masses around 1 tev does not affect much neither the phase dependences nor the decay widths .",
    "as a second possibility , we take masses of 10 tev for the first and second family squarks .",
    "the superpartners of the sm fermions with left and right helicity are the left and right sfermions . in the case of top squark ( stop ) and bottom squark ( sbottom ) the left and right states are in general mixed .",
    "therefore , the sfermion mass terms of the lagrangian are described in the basis ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) as @xcite @xmath32   m_{r l}^{2 } & m_{r r}^{2 }   \\end{array }   \\right )   \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } \\tilde q_l\\\\ [ 1.ex ] \\tilde q_r \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] with @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the mass , electric charge , weak isospin of the quarks and the weak mixing angle , respectively .",

    "( 2.1 ) : @xmath54    note that the left - right mixing is not significant for the first and second generations ; i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( q = u , d , c , s ) .",
    "we might add a comment about the possibility of a flavor mixing , for example , between the second and third squark families .",
    "in this case , the sfermion mass matrix in eq . ( 2.1 ) becomes a 4x4 matrix in the basis ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) .",
    "then one obtains squark mass eigenstates ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) from these weak states , and analyzes their decays by utilizing procedures similar to the ones indicated in the text .",
    "the problem with flavor violation effects is that their inclusion necessarily correlates b , d and k physics with direct sparticle searches at colliders .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that , with sizeable supersymmetric flavor violation , even the higgs phenomenology at the lhc correlates with that of the rare processes @xcite . in this work",
    "we have neglected such effects ; however , we emphasize that inclusion of such effects can give important information on mechanism that breaks supersymmetry via decay products of squarks .",

    "we content with tree - level amplitudes as we aim at determining the phase - sensitivities of the decay rates , mainly .",
