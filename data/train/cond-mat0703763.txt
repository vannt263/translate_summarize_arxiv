    "the development of new growing techniques enables control of the potential responsible for confining the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a nanometer scale .",
    "this potential influences the electronic transport properties of the 2deg and is a key feature that allows us to have systems with profiles appropriate for different purposes in the development of new electronic devices .",
    "in addition , when a dc magnetic field is applied to a 2deg it modifies the effective potential felt by the electrons and can be responsible for externally controlled modifications of the electronic properties of the system .",
    "it is expected that the electronic spin affects the transport properties of the system and a tilted or oscillating magnetic field modifies the state of the spin as well as its dynamical characteristics .",
    "although the large number of papers dealing with this subject @xcite , we are still far from achieving a complete understanding of the role of the intrinsic magnetic moment in the transport phenomena .",
    "it is supposed that the control of the transport properties via the spin will allow the substitution of the actual generation of electronics equipments by the spin - based devices @xcite that can be used , for example , for future applications in quantum computation .",
    "the two - dimensional systems studied here are constituted by free electrons confined in a plane with a very narrow thickness compared to its lateral dimensions . in the  real world \"",
    "these systems might be formed by inversion layers of gaas / algaas structures where the electrons are affected by a periodic potential ( that may be very weak ) as well as spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "these interactions are important in order to fully describe the system , but their main effect is to mix the free electron states ( they couple the landau - level subbands ) . in other words , these interactions will introduce corrections but they will not interfere with the main characteristics of the physical properties studied here .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of a tilted magnetic field on the electrical transport properties of a free 2deg .",
    "we name the two - dimensional region where the electrons are confined the @xmath0 plane , and we set the magnetic field in the @xmath1 plane . in section ii we develop the formalism necessary to describe a two - dimensional electronic system in presence of a tilted magnetic field , taking into account the orbital and spin variables .",
    "since the fermi energy depends on the energy and degeneracy of the states and is one of the key quantities to understand the transport properties of any system , the unique behavior of the landau - level subbands with the spin and field configuration suggests that this quantity should be carefully analyzed .",
    "this is done in section iii where we calculate and discuss the dependence of this quantity with the strength and direction of the dc magnetic field . in order to estimate the influence of the combined effect of the spin and field configuration on the transport properties of 2deg , in section",
    "iv we obtain numerical results for the hall conductivity of low electronic density systems .",
    "the conclusions and general comments are presented in section v.",
    "a noninteracting two - dimensional electronic system may describe a moderate or low electronic density system observed at the interfaces of semiconductors and materials with a wider bandgap such as ingaas / inalas or algaas / gaas . in these structures",
    "the electrons are confined in a narrow quantum well that can be less than @xmath2 @xmath3wide . in these cases",
    "we may write the @xmath4 dependence of the wave function as a gaussian function of half - width @xmath5 equal to the thickness of the system . roughly speaking",
    "@xmath5 is the width of the quantum well that confines electrons in the @xmath0 plane , and here we take @xmath6 @xmath3 for all numerical purposes .",
    "the procedure described above gives a result similar to those obtained many years ago by several authors @xcite for spin independent solutions of this system .",
    "here we go further and we analyze the contribution of the spin ( via zeeman interaction ) . as will be seen , in presence of tilted magnetic fields the spin not only split the levels , but",
    "also produces a singular mixture of the landau - levels subbands with significative consequences on the transport properties of the system .",
    "the one electron hamiltonian for this system is writen as : @xmath7 where the first term is the interaction between the particle s spin and the magnetic field , and @xmath8 denotes the pauli matrices .",
    "the second term is the electron kinetic energy with effective mass @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 in the presence of a dc magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic field is just @xmath12 , where the vector potential is @xmath13 .",
    "we have assumed the @xmath4 dependence of the wave functions as a gaussian function and then the effective hamiltonian ( the total hamiltonian averaged in the @xmath4 direction ) may be written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 . since @xmath16 is a constant ( it commutes with @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is also a constant , a little algebra reduces the search for the one electron eigenstates @xmath20 to the search of @xmath21 and @xmath22 that are solutions of @xmath23    from eq .",
    "( [ lab02a ] ) we find the eigenstates and eigenenergies given by @xmath24 , @xmath25 respectively . here",
    "@xmath26 are the eigenstates of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the solutions of eq .",

    "we display the behavior of the energy of the eigenstates @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the graphic shows the modification introduced by the parallel component of the magnetic field . as usual",
    ", the landau - index gives the information about the orbital behavior of the system , while the spin ( which has its state controlled by the magnetic field ) is responsible for the shift of each level .",
    "as can be seen in this figure , when the parallel component increases , at some point there is an inversion in the sequence of the energies of the states and higher landau levels become lower energy states . this behavior will give a unique characteristic to these systems since it will be responsible for an externally controlled modification of the fermi energy , as well as , the increasing of the degeneracy of the energy states with consequences on the transport properties of the system .",
    "against the angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath4-direction .",
    "the straight ( dashed ) lines are for @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , and n=1 is the line at the bottom.,title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=188 ]",
    "as mentioned before , a moderate or low electronic density allows us to use the one particle approximation to obtain information about the system , and then , a standard calculation can be used to obtain the fermi energy of the system .",
    "the density of state is given by @xmath44 and we may assume a gaussian broadening of width @xmath45 to write @xmath46 as    @xmath47    here @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the length of the system along the @xmath50-direction ) , and we assume that the gaussian has the same width for all energy levels @xmath51 ( we use @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 in all numerical results presented here ) . since the density @xmath56 of particles ( electrons ) is given by @xmath57 with @xmath58^ { - 1}$ ] the fermi - dirac function , a straight calculation gives @xmath59 }   = 0 \\label{eqfermi}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the error function .",
    "for a given electronic density the fermi energy is the value of @xmath61 that satisfies the eq.([eqfermi ] ) .    in figures 2a and 2b",
    "we show the behavior of the fermi energy against the angle between the dc magnetic field and the @xmath4-direction for @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the oscillations observed are a consequence of inversions in the sequence of the energy states , since all of them converge to @xmath64 when @xmath65 is very small .",
    "as the fermi energy is intimately related to the transport properties of the system , this behavior has a strong influence on this property . in figure 3 ,",
    "the direction of the magnetic field is fixed and we let its intensity to vary . the jumps ( discontinuity ) observed are the result of the increasing of the splitting of the states energy .     and the @xmath4-direction for two specific values of the electron density ; ( a)@xmath66 , ( b)@xmath67.,title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=188 ]     as a function of the intensity of a dc magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath4-direction.,title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=188 ]",
    "when an electric field produces a carrier current in the presence of a non collinear magnetic field , there is always a transversal current as a result of the magnetic field .",
    "this is the hall effect .",
    "since the conductivity observed experimentally incorporates several properties of the sample , this effect is used as a tool to study several physical properties and to characterize several materials .    here",
    ", the hall conductivity is used to estimate the influence of a tilt dc magnetic field applied on the 2deg .",
    "we use the results obtained in sections ii and iii to calculate the hall conductivity , which ( within the one particle approximation ) is given by ( see for example refs .",

    "in figure 2 we show the fermi energy as a function of the angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath4-direction .",
    "the behavior of the fermi energy is a direct consequence of the behavior of the energy of the eigenstates depicted in figure 1 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that when @xmath79 increases , the energies of all states go to @xmath80 and , as a consequence , there is an increasing of the number of states per unit of energy .",
    "the increasing of the electronic density enhances this behavior because the electrons are  accommodated \" in a larger number of states and then there will be a bigger mix of populated states .    also , for finite values of @xmath45 , there will be a mix of the gaussian associated with the neighbor energy levels . when the magnetic field increases the degeneracy of the states also increases , and there will be values of @xmath81 where these states are  disconnected \" resulting ( at these points ) in a singular behavior for the fermi energy",
    ". it should be said that if @xmath45 is changed , the shape of the curves are different but the general behavior is preserved .    for electronic density that has the fermi energy located at the landau energy larger than a given @xmath82 but much smaller than @xmath83",
    "the increasing of its value with the external field has a smaller derivative than the case that the fermi energy is bellow @xmath82 , but much bigger than @xmath84 .",
    "this is the main reason to the oscillatory behavior observed when the field is modified .",
    "the hall conductivity also reproduce this result , and it has well defined  terraces \" with length related to the  distance \" of two consecutive minima ( or discontinuity ) of the fermi energy .",
    "this behavior is better noticed when the density of electrons increases and stronger oscillations are observed for the fermi energy ( see figures 2 and 4 ) .",
    "however , the length of the terrace decreases because the distance between the local minima is smaller .",
    "our results show that the conductivity decreases when the magnetic field increases ( see figure 5 ) while the parallel component of the field provides a way to increase it . in both cases",
    "we can see well defined plateaus with length related to the fermi energy behavior .    in summary",
    ", our calculation shows that the fermi energy is strongly dependent on the spin states , which is controlled by the external dc field .",
    "moreover , any property that depends on the fermi - dirac distribution , ( which is dependent on the fermi energy ) will have the influence of these spin states .",
    "we use the hall conductivity to show this fact .",
    "we are now working on a more complex system to demonstrate that the spin states may be used to control the transport properties of selected materials .",
    "this might be the reason for the behavior of the resistivity recently observed by k. vakili et al.@xcite .",
