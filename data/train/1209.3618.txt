    "electrostatic interactions in suspensions of charged colloids are of paramount importance to the structure and phase behaviour of such systems  @xcite .",
    "the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek ( dlvo )  @xcite theory is the most well - known theory by which the pair interactions between screened charged particles can be described .",
    "however , dlvo theory only describes the interactions between homogeneously charged spherical particles and is therefore a _ monopole _ theory .",
    "the rapidly - growing zoo  @xcite of new colloidal particles demands similar theories that are equipped to deal with anisotropy in shape and size .    for classical , spherically charged , particles ,",
    "dlvo theory has proven to be a powerful means to describe the electrostatic properties of systems ; mostly for high - polarity solvents , low surface charge , and high ionic strength .",
    "the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) approach  @xcite extends this range , although analytic results are only possible for a limited number of systems . pb theory",
    "is based on a mean - field approximation that ignores ion - ion correlations , which is justified only for sufficiently high temperatures , not too apolar media , and monovalent ions at reasonable concentrations . in regimes where ion - ion correlations are important",
    "strong - coupling ( sc ) theory  @xcite may be applied .",
    "several modifications to pb theory exist  @xcite , including modifications of the traditional pb theory that account for finite - size ions .",
    "in the computational field , both monte carlo ( mc ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) techniques have been developed to analyse charged particles suspended in an electrolyte . in _ primitive - model _",
    "simulations , ions are taken into account explicitly , whilst the solvent is modelled as a dielectric continuum  @xcite .",
    "ewald sums  @xcite usually provide the basis for calculating the long - ranged coulomb contribution to the total energy of a system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , employing ewald sums is computationally expensive and the systems that can be studied in the primitive model are therefore typically small . when studying charged colloids suspended in an electrolyte it is desirable to coarse - grain the system and use the much shorter ranged effective interactions between the particles instead of accounting for the ions explicitly .",
    "most simulation studies therefore consider systems where the interactions between the colloids can be modelled by a dlvo pair potential  @xcite .",
    "we note that faster ewald - sums implementations exist , e.g. , mesh - based approaches  @xcite , but these can not outperform a course - grained method that does not take the ions into account at all in a system of charged colloidal particles .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the range of applicability for nonlinear pb theory to accurately describe the behaviour of the ion density around charged _ heterogeneous _ particles .",
    "this allows us to quantify the parameter regime for which a ( multipole - expanded ) dlvo approximation may be applied to describe pair interactions in coarse - grained simulations , since ( the electrostatic part of ) such dlvo theories can be derived using pb approximations .",
    "charge - patterned particles have already been studied using the dlvo approximation by partitioning the surface charge over a finite number of point - yukawa charges with different prefactors  @xcite to obtain effective pair interactions . for charge - patterned particles",
    "this approximation still generally results in an expensive calculation of the pair interaction as a function of the separation and orientation .",
    "moreover , the point - yukawa description inadequately accounts for the hard core of the particle , i.e. , it implicitly assumes that ions can penetrate the colloid  @xcite . in this paper a correct , simple , and therefore computationally far more efficient dlvo - multipole approximation is derived for the effective interaction between two charge - patterned particles .",
    "the multipole - based effective interactions have an enormous potential for use in simulation studies to explore the phase behaviour of previously inaccessible systems .",
    "for this study we focus on particles with a janus - type charge pattern .",
    "the term _ janus _ refers to the two - faced roman god of doors and was introduced to describe colloid properties in 1988  @xcite .",
    "a janus particle  @xcite consists of two opposing parts ( usually hemispheres ) with different properties for the wetting , charge , chemical functionality , etc .",
    "the past decade has seen a marked increase in the ability to synthesize such janus colloids  @xcite and their use in self - assembly experiments .",
    "many interesting structures have been found  @xcite and questions have been raised on how to approach simulations of such systems . with our study",
    "we aim to address some of these questions for charged janus particles in an electrolyte , in much the same way as the pioneering simulation studies that probed the applicability of the common dlvo / pb approximation for homogeneously charged particles  @xcite .    in section  [ ewsec : method ]",
    "we introduce the methods by which we compute the ion density around charged janus particles : primitive - model mc simulations ( [ ewsub : simulation ] ) and nonlinear pb theory ( [ ewsub : theory ] ) .",
    "we discuss the results of our investigation in section  [ ewsec : result ] , which is divided into four parts . in section  [ ewsub :",
    "compare ] we introduce the method , based on fourier - legendre ( fl ) mode decomposition , by which we compare the mc and pb results .",
    "this method is applied for a homogeneously charged particle in section  [ ewsub : homogen ] , where we also investigate the relation to the field - theoretical results of refs .",
    "for homogeneously charged flat surfaces . in section",
    "[ ewsub : janus ] we extend our results to a janus dipole and show that there is remarkable correspondence with the results for a homogeneously charged sphere .",
    "we consider a particle with a single charged hemisphere in section  [ ewsub : hemi ] . throughout these sections",
    "we give explicit recipes for calculating the pair interactions between such particles within the pb approximation that we are testing .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the appendix for a derivation of these pair interactions .",
    "we discuss our findings , comment on the potential synergy between simulation methods and theoretical results , and present an outlook in section  [ ewsec : disc ] .",
    "in the following we consider a system of spherical charge - patterned colloids with radius @xmath0 suspended in an electrolyte .",
    "the colloid volume fraction is denoted by @xmath1 .",

    "unless stated otherwise @xmath7 throughout this paper .",
    "we assume that there is a perfect dielectric match between the colloid , the ions , and the medium to avoid any dielectric boundary effects .      to study the systems described above by mc simulations we turn to the primitive model , for which the ions are represented by charged spheres and the solvent",
    "is treated as a dielectric continuum . to simplify the calculations we study only one of these particles , which we locate at the centre of a volume @xmath8 .",
    "we apply periodic boundary conditions to this volume to account for the fact that we are in principle interested in a system which contains many colloids .",
    "the particle s ( heterogeneous ) surface charge is specified by @xmath9 charge sites distributed over this surface , which can be positively or negatively charged , or which do not have charge .",

    "the difference in shape and associated boundary conditions imply that we compare a simple - cubic crystal of colloids with a liquid of colloids at the same volume fraction .",

    "an example of a significant mismatch between the mc and pb results is found deep in the strong - coupling regime where the mc method predicts a total condensation of counter ions in a very small region close to the surface , whilst pb theory predicts that the counter charge is located in a diffuse layer around the colloid of significant width . for higher order modes the value of @xmath130",
