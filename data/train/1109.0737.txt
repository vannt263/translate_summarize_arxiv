    "ultraperipheral collisions at the lhc provide a fine probe for studies of the small x dynamics in much cleaner environment than strong proton - proton ( nucleus ) collisions .",
    "they also provide an important bridge to the future studies at the e - a colliders .",
    "a detailed study of the upc physics was performed by the upc study group and reported in @xcite .",
    "however , all these studies were performed for the planned energy of the heavy ion collisions at the lhc - @xmath2 .",
    "hence , it is necessary to provide the predictions for the current energy @xmath3 in models , used in @xcite , as well as to explore long term advantages of having upc data at two different lhc energies .",
    "also , we receive requests from experimental groups to calculate the quantities which are more readily accessible experimentally - the partial cross sections with dissociation of one or two nuclei with emission of a number of neutrons .    the basic expressions for the cross section of production of vector mesons in ultraperipheral collisions are given in a number of papers , see e.g. @xcite : @xmath4 the quantity @xmath5 is the rapidity of the produced vector meson , and @xmath6 is the flux of photons with the energy @xmath7 emitted by one of nuclei ( @xmath8 is the lorentz factor for colliding nuclei , and @xmath9 -is the photon momentum in the coordinate system of moving nucleus ) .",
    "the specific feature of the ultraperipheral collisions is rather large impact parameter @xmath10 between interacting nuclei .",
    "hence , the flux of photons , radiated by accelerated ion , can be with reasonable accuracy approximated by the equivalent photon spectrum of the point charge @xmath11 , moving with velocity @xmath12 . to avoid the strong interaction of the colliding ions ( which breaks coherence of the process )",
    ", one has to restrict the impact parameters @xmath13 of the interaction by choosing for example @xmath14 or by suppressing the strong interactions by the factor @xmath15 $ ] with @xmath16 describing overlap of colliding ions ( @xmath17 is the nuclear density normalized by the condition @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , due to the large value of @xmath11 in upc of heavy nuclei , there is a significant probability of the photon exchange with excitation of nuclei accompanied by a subsequent decay with emission of neutrons @xcite .",
    "when such additional photon exchange occurs in the final state of upc with the vector meson photoproduction , this does not destroy the coherence of photoproduction , and sum over the final state of ions gives the total coherent photoproduction cross section . on the other hand , measurements by star at rhic",
    "demonstrate that , using the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) which are installed in all detectors at rhic and lhc , it is possible to select different channels , in particular , coherent photoproduction with excitation of ions in which neutrons are emitted by one or both nuclei .",
    "one can distingish several channels : 1n1n - emission of one neutron by each ion , xnxn - emission of several neutrons , 0n1n and 0nxn excitation and decay only of one ion .",
    "to estimate these partial cross sections , we use the model suggested in @xcite where it is shown that coherent photoproduction with additional electromagnetic nucleus excitation can be calculated modifying the flux of photons by impact parameter dependent factors @xmath19 which account for different channels ( i=0n0n , 0n1n,1n1n,0nxn , xnxn ) . hence , the final expression for the photon flux used in our calculations is    @xmath20p_s ( { b})p_{c}^{i}(b ) , \\label{fluxf}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "we provide predictions for the light and heavy vector meson photoproduction with small transverse momenta of vector mesons .",
    "the dynamics of production of mesons , built of light quarks , and those , built of heavy quarks , is qualitatively different .",
    "hence , we treat them separately .",
    "production of @xmath1-meson provides an important check of the modeling of the dynamics of upc . indeed , the cross section @xmath23 is well understood theoretically . though the gribov space -time picture of high energy process of hadron - nucleus interaction differs qualitatively from low energy glauber picture , numerically , the gribov - glauber theory which includes inelastic screening effects predicts very small ( on the level of few percent ) deviations from the glauber formula for hadron - nucleus scattering .",
    "an additional element of the theory in the case of the photon projectile is presence of the non - diagonal transitions @xmath24 .",
    "the generalized vector dominance model combined with glauber approach describes well the data on @xmath1 production at @xmath25 without free parameters @xcite .",
    "it also predicted @xcite reasonably well absolute cross section of the @xmath1 meson photoproduction for @xmath26 = 130 gev as measured in the upc at rhic @xcite .",
    "for high energy photoproduction off heavy nuclei correction to standard vdm+glauber model due to the account for the nondiagonal transitions is about @xmath27 .",
    "since the uncertainty ( combined experimental errors due to the restricted statistics and systematics ) of the experimental cross sections measured by star exceeds this number almost by factor two , we use the standard glauber model formula @xcite for calculation of the cross section of coherent @xmath1 meson photoproduction in the kinematics of upc of heavy ions at rhic and lhc : @xmath28 here @xmath29 , @xmath30 is longitudinal momentum transfer in @xmath31 transition .",
    "we also use donnachie - landshoff model @xcite to calculate the total @xmath32 cross section and forward cross section of coherent @xmath1 photoproduction off the nucleon target .",
    "this model describes reasonably well the data for @xmath33 at energies up to @xmath34 gev studied at hera but can slightly overestimate the cross section at the very high energies due to introducing the hard pomeron exchange with large intercept ( @xmath35 ) in such soft process as coherent photoproduction of @xmath1 with small transverse momentum .",
    "note , that we neglect the interesting effect of interference between production by left and right moving photons @xcite since it gives a small correction in the cross section integrated over rapidities , @xmath36 .",
    "our calculations for @xmath1 meson photoproduction in upc at rhic and lhc are given in tables [ tcrsec]-[tcrseclhc ] and figures [ rothexp]-[rolhc ] . in table",
    "[ tcrsec ] and fig .",
    "[ rothexp ] we compare cross sections obtained in the model described above with results presented by the star collaboration .",
    "it is worth noting that in the star experiment only the ( xnxn ) and ( 1n1n ) channels were measured .",
    "the @xmath1-meson were detected in the rapidity range @xmath37 and @xmath38 mev / c .",
    "the numbers reported by experiment for the total cross sections of various channels were calculated from the measured two cross sections using the the starlight event generator to extrapolate to the larger @xmath39 and to calculate the ratio of the cross section in different channels .",
    "we find a reasonable agreement at lower energies but a significant discrepancy in all measured partial cross sections at @xmath40 gev .",
    ".cross sections of the @xmath1 meson photoproduction in gold - gold upc at rhic calculated in the glauber model .",
    "numbers in brackets present results obtained by star collaboration from analysis of the experimental data on the gold - gold upc studies at rhic .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     if the measurements are done at two energies @xmath3 and @xmath2 a simultaneous analysis of two data sets will allow to extend model independent determination of nuclear ratio to @xmath41 at least a factor of two smaller than in @xmath42 at @xmath2 .",
    "the studies of the @xmath0 production in the heavy ion upc at the lhc will allow to measure coherent photoproduction cross section down to @xmath43 using the channels without nucleus break up which dominate at the lhc energies .",
    "a cross check will be possible using channels with dissociation of nuclei .",
    "however , this would require sorting out situation with the @xmath1-meson production at the rhic energies .",
    "this requires both further experimental studies at rhic and lhc as well as further theoretical studies .",
    "we would like to thank l.frankfurt , v. guzey , s.klein , j.nystrand , yu.gorbunov , for the discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the us doe contract number de - fg02 - 93er40771 and by program of fundamental researches at lhc of russian academy of science ."
