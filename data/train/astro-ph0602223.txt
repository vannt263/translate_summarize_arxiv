    "infrared observations are crucial for studies of the structure of edge - on galaxies .",
    "the all - sky 2mass survey gives a good opportunity to enhance the number of edge - on galaxies available for studies in the near - infrared bands .",
    "whereas faint parts of the galaxies are not seen in the 2mass images , the thin disks of the galaxies are obtained with sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "we refer to the revised flat galaxies catalog ( rfgc ; it contains extragalactic objects with major - to - minor axis ratio a / b @xmath0 7 ) as to a source of edge - on galaxies .",
    "more than 200 rfgc galaxies with major axis size more than 1 were selected .",
    "this size was estimated directly from the 2mass images at the level s / n @xmath2 3 and is significantly less that commonly used diameter d@xmath3 . of them , there are 140 galaxies taken in all three 2mass bands : h , j , and k@xmath4 .",
    "we applied the technique described by @xcite to assess the structural parameters of edge - on disks : the radial ( h ) and vertical ( z@xmath1 ) scales , and central face - on surface brightness s@xmath1 .",
    "this method implies an analysis of photometric profiles drawn parallel to the major and minor axes of galaxy at a one - pixel interval .",
    "the h , z@xmath1 , and s@xmath1 were obtained in the h , j , and k@xmath4 bands for selected 140 galaxies .",
    "the dust layer in spiral galaxies is thinner than the stellar disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since dust extinction is more significant in the j , and less important in the k@xmath4 , we expect to obtain smaller scaleheights for the same galaxies in the k@xmath4 and larger in the j. one of the program galaxy , rfgc 2946 , is shown in figure 1 in the j ( top panel ) , h ( middle ) , and k@xmath4 ( bottom ) bands . in figure 2 ( upper panel )",
    "one can see the scaleheights in different 2mass bands for all considered edge - on galaxies .",
    "the scales in all bands are normalized by the scaleheight in the j. histograms in lower panel of figure 2 show the same normalized slaleheights in the h ( dotted line ) and k@xmath4 ( dashed line ) . the mean relative ratios of the scaleheights are 1.00:0.91:0.86 in j : h : k@xmath4 bands , respectively .",
    "the different values of scaleheights z@xmath1 for different bands enabled us to infer the structural parameters of our edge - on galaxies under assumption of zero extinction , i.e. if they had no dust . here",
    "we assume that the ratio of scaleheights is a linear function of the internal extinction coefficient in given photometric band .",
    "it can be shown that this approximation should work well for small optical depths , i.e. for the case of nir photometry ) .",
    "hence , one can figure out the extinction - free z@xmath1 for the case of zero extinction coefficient .",
    "the resulting value of the extinction - free scaleheights is , on average , 0.76 in units of z@xmath1(j ) .",
    "hence , the k@xmath4 scaleheight of thin stellar disks assessed in the k@xmath4 band overestimates the original scaleleheight by , on average , only 13 % .",
    "because of the large extinction , the scaleheights in the optical photometric bands much more significantly overestimate the real vertical scales of the stellar disks .    as it was shown in @xcite ,",
    "the stellar disks with dimmer central surface brightness ( s@xmath1 ) tend to have smaller ratios of scales ( z@xmath1/h ) .",
    "the dust extinction may ne responsible for at least a part of this relation .",
    "now we can check the relation z@xmath1/h versus s@xmath1 using the extinction - free scaleheights . the central surface brightness in the k@xmath4 band",
    "is considered as s@xmath1 . since the scalelength for",
    "our galaxies does not indicate a clear systematic variation between the j , h , and k@xmath4 bands , we consider the k@xmath4 scalelength here as the `` h '' . figure 3 suggests that correlation between the vertical to radial scales ratio ( z@xmath1/h ) and disks s@xmath1 is not due to dust , but has a physical reason .",
    "this project was partially supported by grant rfbr 04 - 02 - 16518 .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the nasa and the nsf ."
