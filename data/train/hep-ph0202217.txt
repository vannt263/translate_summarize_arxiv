    "one of the great challenges in hadronic physics is to calculate the structure of hadrons starting from qcd alone .",
    "presently this task is very difficult and one relies on specific models to gain some understanding of hadronic structure at low energies and momentum transfer values .",
    "a popular model is the constituent quark model ( cqm ) which in its relativized form has met with quite some success .",
    "a first test of this model is the comparison of the mass spectra it predicts to the experimental data .",
    "such a test provides some constraints on the wave functions .",
    "a more stringent test for the wave functions is found when one also calculates the form factors of a hadron .",
    "it lies in the nature of the cqm that only valence wave functions are determined easily .",
    "however , in a fully covariant calculation of the form factors one needs the full structure of the hadron - quark vertex .",
    "it has been known for some time that there are situations where the form factors can be expressed correctly as convolutions of the wave functions .",
    "such is the case for certain components of the currents . in particular",
    "one finds within the formalism of light - front dynamics ( lfd ) @xcite that the so - called plus component of the currents for a scalar or pseudoscalar meson can be expressed in terms of the wave functions alone for spacelike momentum transfer .",
    "the matrix elements obtained this way we call the _ valence parts_. the parts arising from vertices that can not be expressed in the wave functions we call the _ nonvalence parts_. ( the plus component of a four - vector being a particular combination of its usual components : @xmath9 where the factor @xmath10 is conventional . )    in the case of vector mesons the situation is more complicated .",
    "till now there have been several recipes  @xcite for the extraction of the invariant form factors from the matrix elements of the currents .",
    "it turns out that even when one limits oneself to the plus component , these different ways of extracting the form factors do not produce the same results  @xcite .",
    "one realizes that since the nine complex matrix elements of the current(@xmath2 ) , corresponding to the possible combinations of the polarizations of the initial and final spin-1 particles , can be expressed in terms of three real invariants only , it becomes clear that there must be relations between these matrix elements .",
    "this was of course known for a long time and many authors have used this knowledge to sort out the invariants from the calculated matrix elements . in reference frames where the plus - component of the momentum transfer , @xmath11 , vanishes these relations",
    "can be reduced to just one besides the relations provided by hermiticity , parity and rotation about the @xmath12-axis .",
    "the latter relation is known as the _ angular condition _  @xcite .",
    "in general reference frames the situation was not so clear . in a previous paper @xcite we completely analyzed these conditions for the spin-1 case and found besides the angular condition given before another one .",
    "there we gave only the formal expressions for these consistency conditions . in the @xmath13 frame , however , the additional condition is very simple involving only two helicity amplitudes and does nt seem to provide as strong a constraint as the usual condition since most constituent quark models are expected to satisfy it rather easily . nevertheless , the @xmath13 frame is in principle restricted to the spacelike region of the form factors and it may be useful to impose this additional condition in processes involving the timelike region which must be analyzed in the @xmath14 frame .",
    "thus , it is important to analyze both angular conditions in different frames calculating actually the form factors with existing theoretical models . in the present paper ,",
    "we demonstrate their usefulness for theoretical / phenomenological models for spin-1 objects . in order",
    "that the matrix elements satisfy these constraints , the current operator must transform properly and the state vectors must be eigenstates of total spin . if the models do not have these properties , the angular conditions will not be met .    in this work",
    ", we use a simple but exactly solvable model for the spin-1 ( e.g. @xmath15 ) meson and separate the valence and nonvalence contributions to the three physical form factors to investigate the degree of violations in the two angular conditions for each contribution in different frames .",
    "although the quantitative results that we find in this model may differ in other models depending on the details of the dynamics in each model , the basic structure of model calculations is common and we expect the essential findings from this model calculation may apply to realistic models .    in particular , we compared two different types of polarization vectors , the one obtained from the lf gauge ( @xmath16 , which is usually used in the lf cqm analysis , and the other obtained from the instant form ( if ) polarization , which is not associated with the lf gauge , i.e. @xmath17 , but used in some recent papers@xcite . in both cases , there is a zero - mode contribution , i.e. a contribution from the nonvalence part that remains finite for @xmath18 , even if the plus - component of the currents is used .",
    "specifically , there is a zero mode contribution in the lf helicity case ( @xmath19 ) to the @xmath20 amplitude , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the initial and final helicities , respectively , but there is no zero - mode for other helicity combinations such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 . on the other hand , in the instant form case ,",
    "only @xmath25 is immune to the zero - mode but others such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 do receive zero - mode contributions . of course , the two results are exactly the same if one properly includes the zero - mode contribution .    now turning to the angular conditions ,",
    "there are several different prescriptions  @xcite in choosing the matrix elements to extract the three physical form factors .",
    "we compare three different types of helicity combinations , gk@xcite , cckp@xcite , and bh  @xcite , using both lf and instant form helicity bases in a reference frame where @xmath28 .",
    "one of our very interesting findings of the analysis in the lf helicity basis is that the prescription using the plus - component of the current but not involving the @xmath20 helicity amplitude in the lf gauge is preferred for model calculation .",
    "especially , the gk prescription uses only @xmath29 and @xmath24 but not the pure @xmath30 component and thus achieves the goal of not involving the zero - modes . on the other hand ,",
    "the longitudinal ( 0,0 ) component is the most dominant contribution in the high momentum transfer region and thus it may be better to use the bh prescription , involving the @xmath31 and @xmath32 amplitudes only , in the high momentum perturbative qcd analysis .",
    "the cckp prescription , however , involves all helicity states , i.e. @xmath33 and @xmath32 and one needs a quantitative analysis of the angular conditions to pin down the momentum transfer region for the validity of this prescription .",
    "our quantitative analyses indeed verify that the gk prescription is remarkably free from the zero - mode contribution but others are not . in the recent work by melikhov and simula@xcite",
    ", we see that the result using the gk prescription is not in complete agreement with their covariant model calculation , which is due to the dependence on a light - like four - vector called @xmath34 in their formulation that necessarily involves unphysical form factors . the covariant formulation presented in our work",
    "should be intrinsically distinguished from theirs@xcite , since our formulation involves neither @xmath35 nor any unphysical form factor .",
    "if we use the instant form basis , however , all three prescriptions receive the zero - mode contribution .",
    "since the instant form helicity is not obtained from the lf gauge , i.e. @xmath17 , even the gk prescription gets the zero - mode contribution especially for the magnetic form factor as we shall show in this work .",
    "thus , the instant form basis used in the lf formulation seems quite dangerous , because it can lead to a wrong interpretation of the physics involved in lf dynamical models .",
    "our solvable model calculation clearly indicates that one can avoid the zero - mode contribution if the lf basis when the lf gauge is used without using the longitudinal to longitudinal helicity amplitude .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect.ii ] ,",
    "we summarize the angular conditions for spin-1 systems using the lf helicity basis and the kinematics for the reference frames drell - yan - west ( dwy ) , breit ( brt ) , and target - rest frame ( trf ) used in this work .",
    "the three prescriptions ( gk , cckp , bh ) used in extracting the physical form factors are also briefly discussed in that section . in section [ sect.iii ] , we present our covariant model calculations of physical quantities such as the three electromagnetic form factors and the decay constant of the spin-1 meson system using both the manifestly covariant feynman method and the lf technique . in the @xmath13 frame",

    "in this work , we made a taxonomical analysis of spin-1 form factors with respect to several different prescriptions ( gk , cckp , bh ) , polarization vector choices ( lf , if ) , and reference frames ( dyw , brt , trf ) .",
    "we used the @xmath2 current for all of our analysis .    in the @xmath13 frame",
    ", we looked at both lf and if polarization vectors and made a comparative analysis on the three prescriptions ( gk , cckp , bh ) in relating the matrix elements to the physical form factors . in the light - front gauge , @xmath282 , the light - front helicity basis is the set of eigenvectors of the light - front helicity operator .",
    "however , the instant - form polarization vectors have been also used in the literature .",
    "we find that the zero - mode contamination occurs minimally in the light - front gauge because only the helicity zero to zero amplitude , i.e. @xmath88 , gets a zero - mode contribution , but all others ( @xmath283 ) are immune from the zero - mode in the light - front basis .",
    "thus , one can find a prescription which does nt involve the zero mode contribution at all . indeed , the gk prescription which does nt use @xmath88 has precisely this property .",
    "consequently , the computation of only the valence contributions to the form factors using the gk prescription yields results which coincide exactly with the full results of the form factors as we have shown in figs.[fig_gc]-[fig_gq ] .",
    "these full results can be obtained by the other prescriptions , cckp and bh , only if the zero - mode contributions are added to the valence contributions .",
    "we have also computed the form factors using a manifestly covariant feynman method and explicitly shown that the full results of the light - front calculations are fully in agreement with the covariant one no matter what prescriptions we use .",
    "although the full results are also independent of the choice of the polarization vectors , we find that the nice feature of the gk prescription described above is lost in the instant - form basis . as shown in fig.[fig_gm ] , the valence contribution to the magnetic form factor ( @xmath284 ) computed in the instant - form basis substantially differs from the full result even if the gk prescription is used .",
    "this is due to the fact that a larger number of matrix elements are contaminated by the zero - mode in the instant - form basis and in the particular case of @xmath284 the terms affected by the zero - mode such as @xmath214 and @xmath215 in eq .",
    "( [ g_gk_i ] ) do not cancel each other ( see eq .",
    "( [ sxx ] ) . ) but rather add up .",
    "we thus conclude that the gk prescription in the light - front basis is certainly advantageous for model calculation involving only the valence contributions to the spin-1 form factors .",
    "we have also analyzed the frame dependence of the valence contribution to the physical form factors and the angular conditions using the light - front polarization vectors .",
    "since the three presciptions discussed above are defined only in the @xmath13 frame , we use the prescriptions @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath238 defined in section  [ sect.ii ] to work in a general frame . in dyw frame , our @xmath251 prescription corresponds to the gk prescription and the results on the form factors from our @xmath250 prescription coincide with those from the @xmath251 or gk prescription . also , some combinations of the @xmath251 and @xmath238 prescriptions correspond to the cckp and bh prescriptions depending on the coefficients of the combinations . again",
    ", only the @xmath238 prescription involves the zero - mode and the valence result from the @xmath238 prescription differs from the results of the @xmath250 and @xmath251 prescriptions that coincide each other exactly as shown in figs .  [ fig.05 ] and [ fig.06 ] .",
    "the results in the breit frame reproduce the dyw results if @xmath233 , since they can be transformed into each other by purely kinematic operators in lfd . if @xmath285 , however , the results are quite different from the dyw results . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig.07]-[fig.10 ] more drastic differences in the results among the @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and @xmath238 prescriptions are found at @xmath232 than at @xmath249 .",
    "similar observations can be made also for the trf .",
    "however , the kinematic equivalence to dwy obtains only at a special angle @xmath286 ( see ref .  @xcite . ) which depends on @xmath239 .",
    "thus , it is rather difficult to see the similarity of the results of trf and dyw .",
    "although the angular condition @xmath257 is rather well satisfied , the usual angular condition @xmath258 is severely broken in the small @xmath239 region .",
    "singularities associated with those violations are visible in our figures(see e.g. figs.[fig.18 ] and [ fig.19 ] . ) .    nevertheless , both angular conditions @xmath257 and @xmath258 are well satisfied in the region @xmath239 above a few gev@xmath260 except the tiny region near the singularity position discussed in section [ sect.iv.2.5 ] . and thus the results from all the prescriptions become consistent with each other .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the zero - mode contributions are highly suppressed in the high @xmath239 region and the results are consistent with the perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "this may justify the use of the bh prescription in the analysis of high @xmath239 form factors .",
    "for the low and intermediate @xmath239 regions , however , the zero - mode contributions are very important and the gk prescription with the light - front polarization vectors in the dyw frame is certainly desirable for the form factor analyses .",
