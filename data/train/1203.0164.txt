    "one of the main goals of intermediate energy heavy ion collision ( hic ) is to study properties of nuclear matter , especially to determine the nuclear equation - of - state ( eos ) .",
    "hic provides a unique means to compress nuclear matter to hot and dense phase within a laboratory environment . the pressures that result from the high densities achieved during such collisions strongly influence on the motion of ejected matter and provide the sensitivity to the eos .",
    "in comparison with the conventional hadronic probes , photons interacting only weakly through the electromagnetic force with the nuclear medium are not subjected to distortions by the final state ( neither coulomb nor strong ) interactions and therefore photon delivers an undistorted picture of the emitting source @xcite .",
    "since the last two decades , many model calculations and experimental facts @xcite have indicated that in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions hard photons defined as photons with energies above the giant dipole resonance domain , above 30 mev in this paper , mainly originate from incoherent proton - neutron bremsstrahlung collisions , namely @xmath1 .",
    "a nice review paper on hard photon was available @xcite .",
    "these hard photons are emitted from two distinct sources .",
    "the first and dominant component denoted as direct hard photon ( called as `` direct photon '' for short ) is associated with the first - chance proton - neutron collisions in the initial phase of the heavy - ion reaction .",
    "the second one originates from the secondary proton - neutron collisions in the later stage of the reactions when the di - nuclear system tends to be thermalized , accordingly called as thermal hard photon ( called as `` thermal photon '' for short ) . because of their distinct emission sources , direct photons and thermal photons can deliver thermodynamic and dynamical information of hot and dense nuclear matter formed during the various stages of the heavy - ion collisions .    in relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "photons are also of very interesting since they can be served as one of the potential signals of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation , eg . , see ref .",
    "a hot qgp radiates a large amount of thermal photons , which dominate the spectra at small transverse momenta , whereas hard processes in nucleon - nucleon scatterings produce large momenta photons .",
    "therefore photon enhancement at low transverse momenta could be seen as a qgp signal , which has been observed at the bnl - relativistic heavy - ion collider @xcite .",
    "similar to the feature of photon production in intermediate energy hic , photons emitted from the interior of the hot matter no longer interact with the hadronic medium , in contrast to hadronic observables .",

    "iv , we discuss the different variables ( impact parameter , beam energy and eos ) dependences of the hard photon production and/or anisotropic flow parameters .",
    "v gives the results and discussions on two - photon correlation functions , namely momentum correlation function , which is also called hanbury - brown and twiss ( hbt ) correlation function , as well as azimuthal correlation function .",

    "in particular , two - boson relative momentum distributions enable one to determine the space - time structure according to the formalism of bose - einstein correlations . the magnitude of the correlation can be related to ther space - time distribution of the boson source . in the follwoing calculations",
    ", we will construct two - photon momentum correlation function as well as azimuthal correlation function , from which the space - time structure of the photon souce and anistropy property can be indicated .",
    "intensity interferometry ( also called hbt correlation ) is used as a universal tool to study the properties of any boson sources such as stars @xcite , or photon and meson sources in the early phase of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the formalism was developed starting from optics and quantum statistics and was finally adapted to the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we have performed the calculation which evaluates the correlation function directly from the photon source distribution given by the buu calculation .",
    "we store for each @xmath94th @xmath95 collision its position @xmath96 and the associated photon probability distribution @xmath97 . after the completion of the calculation",
    ", we analyze this output data to construct plane waves with four - momentum @xmath98 at @xmath99 and calculate the two - photon probability for @xmath100 as @xcite : @xmath101\\right ] , \\label{two_photon_pro}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 represents the probability to produce a pair without correlation , and @xmath26 and @xmath103 are the amplitudes related to the normalized probabilities of the direct @xmath104 $ ] and cross terms @xmath105 $ ] .",
    "this corresponds to fourier transforming the photon source event by event .",
    "we set the weight of the interference in eq .",
    "[ two_photon_pro ] as @xmath106 , that is @xmath107 , which was predicted between 0.5 and 1.0 depending on the anisotropy of hard photon emission .",
    "the exact experimental filter was finally applied to the projection onto the lorentz - invariant relative four momentum @xmath108 of the resulting distribution @xmath109 and @xmath102 of eq .",
    "[ two_photon_pro ] , then the two - photon correlation function was calculated as @xmath110 = f(q)$ ] .    for convenience ,",
    "@xmath106 was set to 0.75 for our calculations in order to take into account the established anisotropic component in the angular distribution of hard photons .",
    "the two - photon correlation function has been fitted with a gaussian parameterization with correlation strength @xmath111 and radius parameter @xmath112 : @xmath113 in the above relation @xmath112 is the space - time parameter conjugate to @xmath114 , which measures an invariant length depending on the source - size parameters @xmath19 and @xmath115 : @xmath116 one can easily know that , since @xmath117 , @xmath112 is a first order measure of the spatial extent of the source , that is @xmath118 .",
    "we can then calculate from @xmath119 the rms radius of the source as the one of a static three - dimensional gaussian source : @xmath120 .",

    "[ c_hbt ] presents hbt correlation functions of direct photons ( green squres ) , thermal photons ( blue triangles ) and inclusive photons ( red open circles ) , respectively .",
    "we find that the correlation function of direct photons is much larger than thermal one , and the correlation function of inclusive photons is intermediate .",
    "this result is reasonable , because direct photons are emitted at the early compressed stage of collisions , so they have stronger interference than thermal photons which are produced in later thermalizing stage .",
    "we also see that our result can well reproduce the experimental data @xcite , especially for the correlation function of thermal photons , which agrees with the experimental function even the oscillation structure . therefore , we can successfully reproduce the hbt correlation function of hard photons by the buu simulation .    in order to further study the hbt correlation of hard photon and",
    "extract photon source information , we calculated the symmetric reaction system @xmath24ca + @xmath24ca at 60@xmath26 mev in the c.m .",
    "frame , and only the events of central collision ( @xmath130 ) were taken for simplification . in fig .",
    "[ c_hbt2 ] , we find that the correlation function of direct photons is the largest , the thermal one is the least , and the correlation function of inclusive photons are between them . moreover , in the conditions of above reaction , all of them can be well fitted by eq .",
    "[ hc_fit ] . after fitting correlation function ,",
    "we can obtain two useful fitting parameters : correlation strength @xmath111 and radius parameter @xmath112 . as the results on top right corner show , direct photons have the largest correlation strength @xmath111 , the second is inclusive photons and",
    "the least one is thermal photons .",
    "thus @xmath111 is a parameter which is sensitive to the intensity of interference .",
    "and we also get three radius parameters @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath112 of thermal photons is nearly twice than direct photons , and inclusive photon is equivalent to the later . to explain this , we know that direct photon is mostly emitted in the early stage when the reaction system is strongly compressed , so the emission source of photons is small . and",
    "later on , the thermalizing system extends very much in company with the production of thermal photons . in this reaction energy at @xmath131 = 60@xmath26 mev , most of hard photons are produced in the early stage of the collision , so the spatial source extent of inclusive photons should be approximate to the direct photons . as a result , they have equivalent radius parameter @xmath112 .",
    "then we can get the rms radius of the photon source by the equation @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , two - photon correlation function provides the information of hard photon source , which is available to investigate the emission source during the collisions .      from individual - photon azimuthal distribution",
    ", we find that direct hard photons exhibit the azimuthal asymmetric emission in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions , especially negative elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 .",
    "actually it is difficult to extract the elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 by the method of reconstructing reaction plane in the experiment , so as below , we will discuss to use the method of two - photon azimuthal correlation to extract the elliptic flow of direct photons directly .",
    "for particles in the same class , we defined the particle azimuthal correlation function following the multi - fragment azimuthal correlation method @xcite .",
    "the multi - fragment azimuthal correlation function is defined as follows : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the @xmath134 distribution for fragment pairs from the same event and @xmath135 is the @xmath134 distribution by randomly selecting each member of a fragment pair to form mixed events .",
    "the @xmath134 between all selected fragments in an event are used to construct the correlation function , that is , @xmath136 angles for @xmath43 fragments .    in our calculations for two - photon azimuthal correlations , we get @xmath133 from the @xmath134 distribution of photon pairs in the same event and @xmath135 from the mixed events . for these correlations , we may make a fit of the fourier series with the expression @xmath137 , \\label{cazifit}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are treated as fit parameters .",

    "further , as shown in fig .",
    "[ hcazi_v2e ] , we get the excitation function of @xmath52 by the above two methods which shows nearly same amplitude of @xmath52 in various reaction energy but different signs . therefore , in view of the difficulty to reconstruct reaction plane in experiment , two - photon azimuthal correlation provides us an alternative method to extract the amplitude of elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 of hard photons .",
    "in summary , we have systematically investigated hard photon production by the process of proton - neutron bremsstrahlung as well as the behavior of azimuthal asymmetry of hard photons and free protons produced in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions in the framework of the buu model .",
    "as discussed in previous studies , hard photons can be separated into direct hard photon which is produced by the first channel neutron - proton bremsstrahlung and thermal hard photon which is produced by the later stage neutron - proton bremsstrahlung during the system s evolution towards thermalization .",
    "the kinetic energy spectra of two kinds of photons show the exponential form which provides us with information on the apparent temperature in different stage of heavy - ion collision .",
    "the azimuthal asymmetry parameters have been investigated in detail .",
    "the time evolution of directed flow and elliptic flow of hard photons exhibits rich structure as the density of the system oscillates during the pre - equilibrium and thermalization stage of reaction system .",
    "this structure indicates that the azimuthal asymmetry evolves with time .",
    "a nonzero directed transverse flow and elliptic flow parameter have been predicted for the direct hard photons produced by the first channel proton - neutron bremsstrahlung process in the intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the asymmetry parameters of hard photons are plotted as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum , which show contrary signs in comparison with the flow of free protons , i.e. the azimuthal asymmetry of direct hard photons seems to be anticorrelated to that of the corresponding free proton s .",
    "therefore we can expect the direct hard photon can server as a good probe to nuclear matter properties in the early stage of hic .",
    "different variables dependences are investigated for the hard photon production and anisotropic flow .",
    "we can see that the absolute value of both directed flow and elliptic flow of direct photons and free protons increase with the impact parameter , indicating that the flow mainly reflects the initial geometric asymmetry of the collision zone in a given beam energy and revealing a rich structure of flows with increasing beam energy . for directed flow , direct photons reach a minimum of around 40@xmath26 mev where the free protons approach the maximum negative value , while for elliptic flow , the absolute values of direct photons show decreasing trends with increasing beam energy .",
    "the eos dependence for hard photons at different time indicates that the direct photon is not sensitive to the nuclear incompressibility nor to the symmetry energy .",
    "however , for the thermal photon , its multiplicity increases with nuclear incompressibility . for a given nuclear incompressibility ,",
    "the soft symmetry energy favors thermal photon production .",
    "finally , we calculated the two - photon correlations , including hbt momentum correlations and azimuthal correlations . from two - photon hbt correlations , we can extract photon source information , such as intensity interference and the spatial extent of the emission source .",
    "we also find that two - photon azimuthal correlations can provide us with a good method for extracting the amplitude of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath0 of hard photons in the experiment .    in light of the present study",
    ", we expect that direct photons would be a very useful probe for exploring nuclear reaction dynamics in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions , while the thermal hard photon can give us some hints on the nuclear eos , including the symmetry energy .",
