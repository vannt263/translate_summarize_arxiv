    "<S> the energy of the system is increased according to the blue curve in fig.2(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this decreases the effective height of the barrier and the particles tunnel faster . </S>",

    "<S> [ tb ]    we observe a decrease in the tunneling time constant over two orders of magnitude for increasing magnetic field due to the gain in interaction energy caused by the cir . + for a direct comparison of the properties of the two interacting distinguishable fermions with those of two identical fermions we perform the same measurement with two fermions in state @xmath44 in the same potential [ fig.1(c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these reference measurements are shown in fig.3 and fig.4 ( green points ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the identical fermions are noninteracting we find no dependence of the tunneling time constant on the magnetic field in this measurement . </S>",
    "<S> + comparing the results of the two systems we find that the tunneling time constant for the interacting system decreases monotonically with increasing magnetic field and crosses the magnetic field independent tunneling time constant of the two identical fermions . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is one magnetic field value where the tunneling time constants of both systems are equal . at this point </S>",
    "<S> both systems must have the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> for a 1d system with given energy there is only one unique solution for the square modulus of the wave function . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , right at the observed crossing point of the tunneling time constants the energy and the square modulus of the wave function @xmath45 of the two interacting distinguishable fermions and the two noninteracting identical fermions must be equal . hence , exactly at this crossing point the system of two distinguishable fermions is fermionized . </S>",
    "<S> as predicted by theory @xcite we find the position of the fermionization at the magnetic field value where @xmath28 diverges due to the confinement - induced resonance . + for magnetic field values below the cir we have realized the two - particle limit of a tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> above the cir we have created a super - tonks state consisting of two particles . </S>",
    "<S> the super - tonks state is a strongly correlated metastable state above the attractive ground state branch [ see fig.2(b ) ] . in a system with particle numbers @xmath46 inelastic three - body collisions </S>",
    "<S> lead to a fast decay of the metastable super - tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our two - particle super - tonks state is stable against collisional losses since there is no third particle available to undergo an inelastic three - body event . </S>",

    "<S> this theory needs two input parameters , the coupling strength and the level spacing . for the coupling strength we use @xmath28 of our system shown in fig.4(b ) . for the level spacing we use the energy difference @xmath47hz between the ground and first excited state of the potential which we calculate using the wkb method . with this approximation </S>",
    "<S> the energy obtained from the tunneling measurements and the energy obtained from the analytic theory @xcite are the same at the cir . for the tonks regime </S>",
    "<S> we find excellent agreement of the experimentally determined energy with the theoretical prediction for a harmonic trap . above the cir </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic theory is not applicable because the second excited state is not bound in our potential . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we expect deviations for larger energies due to the limited validity of the wkb approximation for energies close to the continuum threshold . a more precise description could be achieved by adapting the theory described in @xcite to our nonharmonic potential and by using a more accurate theory for the tunneling process @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the interaction energy of two distinguishable fermions as a function of the interaction strength and identified the point of fermionization . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement between our results and theoretical predictions shows that our experiment has the capability to simulate strongly correlated few - body quantum systems . using the experimental methods </S>",
    "<S> established in this work it is straightforward to extend our studies to more complex systems . simply adding a third particle either in one of the present spin states @xcite or a different spin state @xcite allows us to study a highly nontrivial system where no analytical solution exists . in a few - body system with defined particle number and attractive interaction </S>",
    "<S> we could investigate pairing phenomena and thus work towards studying superfluidity in finite systems . </S>",
    "<S> this has already been investigated in the context of nuclear physics @xcite . by dynamically changing the shape of the trapping potential we could simulate a vast amount of different time - dependent quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> a feasible experiment would be to periodically modulate the strength of the magnetic field gradient . </S>",
