    "in @xmath3 physics , there exist several qcd - inspired approaches describing the nonleptonic @xmath3 decays , such as qcd factorization ( qcdf ) , pqcd and soft collinear effective theory .",
    "however , this is not the case in the @xmath4 sector . although charm has been with us for 35 years , until today a theoretical description of the underlying mechanism for exclusive hadronic @xmath4 decays based on qcd is still not yet available .",
    "this has to do with the mass of the charm quark , of order 1.5 gev .",
    "it is not heavy enough to allow for a sensible heavy quark expansion and light enough for the application of chiral perturbation theory . after more than three decades , we are still back to square one : besides the effective short - distance hamiltonian we need to rely on naive factorization , or the improved version of factorization such as the generalized factorization known as the bauer - stech - wirbel model@xcite or the factorization based on @xmath5 expansion . in the past 15 years or so ,",
    "people have tried to apply pqcd or qcdf to hadronic charm decays .",
    "however , it does not make much sense to generalize these approaches to charm decays as the @xmath6 power corrections are so large that the heavy quark expansion in @xmath6 is beyond control .",
    "there is another powerful tool which provides a model - independent analysis of the charm decays , namely , the diagrammatic approach .",
    "it is complementary to the factorization approach .",
    "analysis based on the flavor - diagram approach indicates a sizable weak annihilation ( @xmath7-exchange or @xmath7-annihilation ) topological amplitude with a large phase relative to the tree amplitude . since weak annihilation and final - state interactions ( fsis ) are both of order @xmath6 in the heavy quark limit , this means fsis could play an essential role in charm decays .",
    "indeed , we shall see that weak annihilation contributions arise mainly from final - state rescattering .",
    "this explains why an approach based on heavy quark expansion in @xmath6 is not suitable for charm decays .",
    "the two - body nonleptonic weak decays of heavy mesons can be analyzed in terms of six distinct quark diagrams@xcite : @xmath8 , the color - allowed external @xmath7-emission tree diagram ; @xmath9 , the color - suppressed internal @xmath7-emission diagram ; @xmath10 , the @xmath7-exchange diagram ; @xmath11 , the @xmath7-annihilation diagram ; @xmath12 , the horizontal @xmath7-loop diagram ; and @xmath13 , the vertical @xmath7-loop diagram .",
    "( the one - gluon exchange approximation of the @xmath12 graph is the so - called `` penguin diagram '' . )",
    "it should be stressed that these diagrams are classified according to the topologies of weak interactions with all strong interaction effects encoded , and hence they are _ not _ feynman graphs .",
    "therefore , analyses of topological graphs can provide information on final - state interactions .",
    "the first study of topological amplitudes in charm decays was due to rosner@xcite . using the most recent cleo measurements@xcite for @xmath14 decays ,",
    "the reduced quark - graph amplitudes @xmath15 are extracted from the cabibbo - favored ( cf ) @xmath14 decays to be ( in units of @xmath16 gev)@xcite @xmath17 for @xmath18 , the @xmath19 mixing angle defined in terms of the flavor states @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the fitted @xmath22 value is 0.29 per degree of freedom with quality @xmath23 .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp1 ] ) we see that the color - suppressed amplitude @xmath9 not only is comparable to the tree amplitude @xmath8 in magnitude but also has a large strong phase relative to @xmath8 .",
    "( it is @xmath24 in naive factorization . )",
    "the @xmath7-exchange @xmath10 is sizable with a large phase of order @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath7-exchange is of order @xmath6 in the heavy quark limit , this means that @xmath6 corrections are very important in charm decays .",
    "finally , we see that @xmath7-annihilation is substantially smaller than @xmath7-exchange and almost perpendicular to @xmath10 .    in naive factorization ,",
    "the factorizable weak annihilation amplitudes are usually assumed to be negligible as they are helicity suppressed or , equivalently , the form factors are suppressed at large @xmath26 . at first glance",
    ", it appears that the factorizable weak annihilation amplitudes are too small to be consistent with experiment at all .",
    "however , in the diagrammatic approach here , the topological amplitudes @xmath10 and @xmath11 do receive contributions from the tree and color - suppressed amplitudes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , via final - state rescattering , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : dfsi ] . therefore , even if the short - distance weak annihilation vanishes , a long - distance weak annihilation can be induced via inelastic fsis .     and",
    "@xmath27 from the color - allowed @xmath28 and color - suppressed @xmath29 decays , respectively , followed by a resonant - like rescattering . while ( a ) has the same topology as the @xmath7-exchange graph , ( b ) mimics the @xmath7-annihilation amplitude.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    ( a ) as the long - distance @xmath30- and @xmath31-channel contributions to the @xmath7-exchange amplitude in @xmath32 .",
    "the thick line in ( a ) represents a resonance.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    since fsis are nonperturbative in nature , in principle it is extremely difficult to calculate their effects .",
    "it is customary to consider the final - state rescattering at the hadron level .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : dfsi](a ) is manifested at the hadron level as fig .",
    "[ fig : wexchange ] : an @xmath30-channel scalar particle exchange with the quark content @xmath33 and a @xmath31-channel contribution with a @xmath34 particle exchange .",
    "the next question is which contribution dominates .",
    "one thing unique to charm decays is that an abundant spectrum of resonances is known to exist at energies close to the mass of the charmed meson .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite , most of the properties of resonances follow from unitarity alone , without regard to the dynamical mechanism that produces the resonance .",
    "systems receives little contributions from resonant fsis .",
    "] as shown in @xcite , the effect of resonance - induced fsis [ fig .",
    "2(a ) ] can be described in a model - independent manner in terms of the mass and width of the nearby resonances .",
    "it is found that weak annihilation amplitudes are modified by resonant fsis as@xcite @xmath35 with @xmath36 , where the @xmath7-exchange amplitude @xmath10 and @xmath7-annihilation @xmath11 before resonant fsis are denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "therefore , even if the short - distance weak annihilation is turned off , a long - distance @xmath7-exchange ( @xmath7-annihilation ) contribution still can be induced from the tree amplitude @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) via fsi rescattering in resonance formation . to see the importance of resonant fsis ,",
    "consider the scalar resonance @xmath39 with a mass @xmath40 mev and a width @xmath41 mev , contributing to the @xmath7-exchange in @xmath42 .",
    "assuming @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , we obtain @xmath44 , which is close to the  experimental \" value of @xmath10 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that _ weak annihilation topologies in @xmath14 decays are dominated by nearby resonances via final - state rescattering . _    under the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , one can use the topological amplitudes extracted from cf modes to predict the rates for singly cabibbo - suppressed ( scs ) and doubly cabibbo - suppressed ( dcs ) decays . in general , the agreement with experiment is good except some discrepancies in scs decays .",
    "for example , the predicted rates for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are too large , while those for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are too small compared to experiment@xcite .",
    "we find that part of the su(3 ) breaking effects can be accounted for by su(3 ) symmetry violation manifested in the color - allowed and color - suppressed tree amplitudes .",
    "however , in other cases such as the ratio @xmath53 , su(3 ) breaking in spectator amplitudes leads to @xmath54 and is still not sufficient to explain the observed value of @xmath55 .",
    "this calls for the consideration of su(3 ) violation in the @xmath7-exchange amplitudes .",
    "we argue that the long - distance resonant contribution through the nearby state @xmath56 can naturally explain why @xmath0 decays more copiously to @xmath57 than @xmath58 through the @xmath7-exchange topology@xcite .",
    "this has to do with the dominance of the scalar glueball content of @xmath56 and the chiral - suppression effect in the decay of a scalar glueball into two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the same fsi through the @xmath56 pole contribution also explains the occurrence of @xmath59 . in short ,",
    "the long - standing puzzle for @xmath60 is now understood .",
    "since the spectator quark of the charmed meson may end up in the pseudoscalar or vector meson , there exist two different types of reduced amplitudes @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the spectator topology and likewise for weak annihilation .",
    "a fit to the data of cf @xmath61 decays gives the best solutions@xcite ( in units of @xmath16 ) @xmath64 we did nt find solutions for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the topological amplitude expressions of @xmath67 and @xmath68 in units of @xmath69 are given by @xmath70 under the @xmath71-parity argument , the decay @xmath72 is prohibited via direct or resonance - induced @xmath7-annihilation ; that is , @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , a general consideration of resonant fsis gives the relations@xcite @xmath74 the above relation shows that @xmath75 does not receive any @xmath76 resonance ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath77 resonance @xmath78 ) contributions .",
    "experimentally , however , it is the other way around@xcite : @xmath79 and @xmath80 . to resolve this puzzle",
    ", we notice that there are long - distance final - state rescattering contributions to @xmath81 allowed by @xmath71-parity conservation .",
    "a nice example is the contribution from the weak decay @xmath82 followed by quark exchange .",
    "the rescattering of @xmath83 into @xmath84 is prohibited by the @xmath71-parity selection rule .",
    "consequently , @xmath85 , where the superscript @xmath37 indicates final - state rescattering via quark exchange , and @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath87 has the largest rate among the cf @xmath88 decays , it is conceivable that @xmath72 can be produced via fsis at the @xmath89 level as its branching fraction .",
    "therefore , _ contrary to the @xmath90 sector , weak annihilation in @xmath91 systems is dominated by final - state rescattering via quark exchange . _    in principle , the annihilation amplitudes can be determined from the four decays @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath84 .",
    "however since @xmath95 , it is not possible to find a nice fit to the above - mentioned four decays simultaneously .",
    "this leads to a contradiction with data , as @xmath96 while the former is dominated by @xmath97 and the latter by @xmath98 .",
    "so a full determination of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 amplitudes still await more precise data on the related modes .",
    "we conjecture that the currently quoted experimental results for both @xmath99 and @xmath100 are overestimated and problematic .",
    "there are two interesting applications of the diagrammatic approach : 0.1 cm   the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing is governed by the mixing parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the mass eigenstates @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "it is known that the short - distance contribution to the mixing parameters is very small@xcite , of order @xmath16 . on the theoretical side ,",
    "there are two scenarios : the inclusive approach relied on @xmath6 expansion ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent study ) and the exclusive approach with all intermediate states summed over . in the well - known paper @xcite , only the su(3 ) breaking effect in phase space was considered for the estimate of @xmath105 .",
    "consequently , the previous estimate of mixing parameters is subject to large uncertainties .",
    "we believe that a better approach is to concentrate on 2-body decays and rely more on the data and less on theory .",
    "this is because the measured 2-body decays account for about 75% of hadronic rates of @xmath4 mesons . for @xmath90 and @xmath91 modes , data with good precision for cf and scs decays",
    "are now available . for as - yet unmeasured dcs modes",
    ", their rates can be determined from the diagrammatic approach .",
    "we obtain@xcite @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath90 and @xmath91 final states account for nearly half of the hadronic width of @xmath0 , it is conceivable that when all hadronic states are summed over , one could have @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "they are consistent with the recent babar measurement@xcite @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we believe that our estimate of the mixing parameters is more realistic and reliable .",
    "0.1 cm   @xmath2 is the only allowed baryonic charm decay and it proceeds via @xmath7-annihilation . since the factorizable decay amplitude vanishes in the chiral limit , its branching fraction is very small , of order @xmath16 .",
    "this mode was first observed by cleo@xcite with the result @xmath112 .",
    "it receives long - distance contributions through final - state scattering of tree and color - suppressed amplitudes . assuming that the long - distance enhancement of @xmath7-annihilation in the baryonic @xmath113 decay is similar to that in the meson sector , where the latter can be obtained from the analysis of the diagrammatic approach",
    ", we find that @xmath2 becomes visible@xcite .",
    "the observation of this baryonic charm decay implies the dynamical enhancement of @xmath7-annihilation in the @xmath113 decay .",
