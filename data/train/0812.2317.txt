    "ferroelectric ( fe ) solids have been the subject of many theoretical studies for a long time . in particular , the nature of their phase transitions , displacive versus order - disorder , and the microscopic mechanisms that might be responsible for them , the space and time correlation of dipoles , the damping of the soft mode in the high - temperature phases , have attracted very soon much interest since these phenomena are of fundamental interest to understand the deep nature of ferroelectricity .    from a phenomenological point of view , fe phase transitions are well described in the framework of the landau theory .",
    "this theory assumes the existence of a so - called landau free energy @xmath2 , that can be seen as an `` incomplete '' thermodynamic potential@xcite :    @xmath3    in which @xmath4 is an incomplete partition function defined by @xmath5 in this expression , the summation is extended over the microscopic states @xmath6 with energy @xmath7 exhibiting a polarization equal to @xmath0 . in landau theory ,",
    "the equilibrium order parameter @xmath0 is obtained as the value minimizing the landau free energy .",
    "the landau theory has been successfully applied to batio@xmath1 ( bto ) by devonshire in the fiftees@xcite .",
    "he expanded the landau free energy in power series up to sixth order in the three components of the polarization @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "assuming a linear dependence with temperature of the coefficient of the @xmath11 term ( as stated by landau theory ) , he showed that the three phase transitions of barium titanate can be described with a relatively simple expression of the free energy . since this pionnering work",
    ", landau theory has been applied to barium titanate in many other forms than bulk ( films@xcite , wires@xcite ) and to many other ferroelectrics@xcite .",
    "the direct calculation of the landau free energy requires two things :    \\(1 ) performing simulations with fixed polarization , which can be achieved easily within constrained molecular dynamics ( with modified equations of motion obtained from lagrangian formalism ) , or by applying a suitable external electric field@xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) calculating the thermodynamic potential .",
    "this last point is the most difficult since standard simulation techniques such as monte carlo ( mc ) or molecular dynamics ( md ) do not give a direct access to the free energy , that can not be attained as the thermal average of some microscopic quantity .",
    "these two techniques only give access to macroscopic states of the system that are _ minima _ of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the coefficients of the free energy expansion for barium titanate have been calculated from the first - principles derived effective hamiltonian of zhong _",
    "et al_@xcite in an elegant way by i@xmath12iguez _",
    "et al_@xcite through monte carlo simulations under applied external electric field .",
    "although monte carlo only gives access to the minima of the free energy , these authors used the external field to displace the minima in the 3-d space ( p@xmath13 , p@xmath14 , p@xmath15 ) and get access to the coefficients of the expansion and their temperature dependence .",
    "in fact , their approach could have been extended to obtain the derivatives of the free energy with respect to the polarization at various points , and thus , by integration , get access to the free energy as a function of @xmath0 without any assumption on its analytical form .",
    "the approach we propose in this article is formally equivalent to this point .    indeed",
    ", some efficient techniques do exist to get directly insight into the thermodynamic potential ( or more precisely into differences of thermodynamic potential ) , such as umbrella sampling@xcite , free energy perturbation@xcite or thermodynamic integration@xcite .",
    "the basic idea of thermodynamic integration is to find a `` reaction coordinate '' @xmath16 joining continuously two macroscopic states @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and calculate the derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath16 ( normally accessible within constrained md ) along this path .",
    "this derivative can thus be integrated to obtain the difference of free energy between @xmath17 and @xmath18 :    @xmath19    or even the whole free energy profile along the path . in this formula",
    ", @xmath20 is the incomplete thermodynamic potential defined above .    in most cases ,",
    "this yields :    @xmath21    in which @xmath22 is the potential energy@xcite .    this technique is widely used in computational chemistry and chemical physics , two fields in which scientists are interested in calculating free energy profiles along a reaction coordinate @xmath16 to obtain the activation free energy of a chemical reaction or its equilibrium constant ( related to the standart change in free energy ) . the free energy for a given value of @xmath16 ( referenced to that with @xmath17 )",
    "is interpreted as the `` potential of mean force '' on the reaction coordinate    @xmath23    _ i.e. _ the potential related to the averaged force acting on the reaction coordinate @xmath16 ( usually @xmath24 is the external force that must be applied to maintain the reaction coordinate invariant ) .    in our case , if we choose for @xmath16 the polarization and take as starting point ( @xmath16=0 ) the paraelectric state of bto at some given temperature , it is thus formally possible to get access to the free energy for any value of @xmath0 , _ i.e. _ the landau free energy of the ferroelectric crystal .",
    "thus we interpret the landau free energy as a potential of mean force , calculated as a function of the polarization , considered as the reaction coordinate .",
    "chemists have been using this technique for a long time to calculate reaction free energies and activation free energies along paths defined by a reaction coordinate@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we transpose the thermodynamic integration technique to the field of ferroelectricity .",
    "we adopt the formalism of the effective hamiltonian@xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the number of degrees of freedom of the perovskite ( 15 per abo@xmath1 unit cell ) is reduced to 6 per abo@xmath1 unit cell , chosen to be local collective displacements constructed from the lowest - energy eigenvectors of the force constant matrix .",
    "two kinds of such modes are considered : the `` local modes '' @xmath25 , that roughly represent the dipole in each unit cell , and the `` displacement modes '' @xmath26 , describing the inhomogeneous strain .",
    "the use of such degrees of freedom has revealed to be efficient and sufficient to describe correctly the thermodynamics of bto ( in particular its complex sequence of phase transitions ) . in terms of these relevant degrees of freedom , the potential energy is the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the homogeneous strain tensor .",
    "the local modes @xmath25 are related to the polarization by :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the volume of the supercell and @xmath31 the effective charge of the local modes .",
    "we define an average local mode",
    "@xmath32 : @xmath33 in which @xmath34 is the number of unit cells in the supercell .",
    "fixing @xmath0 is thus equivalent to fix @xmath32 and we use @xmath32 for convenience in the following ( we calculate the free energy as a function as @xmath32 ) .",
    "@xmath32 has the dimension of a displacement .",
    "our approach in this work is based on molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "the first - principles derived hamiltonian of zhong _ et al _ can be solved either via monte carlo simulations or molecular dynamics , that should yield similar results under the ergodicity hypothesis .",
    "we have already validated the md method with the effective hamiltonian on barium titanate@xcite and showed that its complex sequence of phase transitions as well as the temperature evolution of the polarization and strain can be reproduced successfully as it is in monte carlo .",
    "this is achieved by combining the nos - hoover@xcite ( to fix the temperature ) and the parinello - rahman@xcite ( to fix the pressure / stress ) algorithms .",
    "more details about this molecular dynamics are given in appendix b.    anyway , to calculate differences of free energy along a path indexed by polarization ( reaction coordinate ) , it is necessary to perform md under fixed polarization .",
    "additional forces have to be added in the dynamical equations of motion that ensure the constraint @xmath35 . these additional forces can be found in a simple manner starting from the lagrangian formalism .",
    "let us call @xmath36 the lagrangian of the system without constraint , and @xmath37 that of the system with constraint .",
    "@xmath38 in which @xmath39 are lagrange multipliers and @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "applying the lagrange equations on @xmath37 gives a new set of equations of motion for the local modes : @xmath42 in which @xmath43 is the mass associated to the local modes@xcite and @xmath44 the @xmath45-component of the force acting on the @xmath46 local mode .",
    "summing over @xmath47 gives immediately the value of the lagrange multiplier along @xmath45 :    @xmath48    maintaining the polarization fixed is thus equivalent to add to the force acting on each local mode ( and at each time step ) a term equal to ( minus ) the ( space-)average of the forces .",
    "the _ total _ external force that must be applied to maintain @xmath0 fixed is thus @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 will be thus qualified in the following of this paper as the ( internal ) force `` acting on the polarization '' ( one must apply its opposite to the system so as to maintain the polarization invariant ) .",
    "the equations of motion of the displacement modes @xmath26 are not affected by the constraint .      the application of the technique of the thermodynamic integration yields in our case : @xmath51    in which a continuous path is assumed from @xmath52 to @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath53 is the free energy of the entire supercell , and the summation is over all the local modes of the supercell .",
    "n , v and t are assumed constant along this path . a proof of this equation is given in appendix a. for each point of the path",
    ", the thermal average of the forces is calculated under fixed @xmath32 . in the previous formula , @xmath54 .    in the particular case of a linear path along the @xmath45-axis",
    ": @xmath55 in which the calculation is performed along the @xmath45 direction ( @xmath56 is the @xmath45 component of @xmath32 , and @xmath57=0 along the path ) .",
    "the formula can be written in a local form : @xmath58    the landau free energy is thus the potential of mean force acting on the polarization .",
    "it is the integral of minus the thermal average of the total force that is acting on the polarization ( _ i.e. _ the total external force that must be added to maintain the constraint ) . written as an infinitesimal variation @xmath59 the right hand - side member can be interpreted as a ( thermodynamic ) work and the link with the basic laws of thermodynamics is easy ( see appendix c ) .",
    "if we define a free energy per unit cell @xmath60 , and an average force per unit cell also @xmath61 , we get the very simple expression : @xmath62    we have thus to perform constrained md simulations at different values of @xmath56 , and calculate in each case the thermal average of the sum of the forces acting on the local modes .",
    "this is why md is well suited to thermodynamic integration since the forces are directly available .",
    "we perform molecular dynamics ( md ) based on the effective hamiltonian of ref .   using the code described in ref .  .",
    "we use a 12@xmath6312@xmath6312 supercell with periodic boundary conditions for the thermodynamic integration . for the direct md simulations ,",
    "we also use this size of supercell , excepting below the phase transition , in which finite - size effects are responsible for rapid reversal of the polarization : in that case we use 14@xmath6314@xmath6314 and 16@xmath6316@xmath6316 supercells ( 10 k below the phase transition ) to improve the quality of the numerical results .",
    "the equations of motion are solved within the well - known verlet algorithm .",
    "we use a nos - hoover@xcite thermostat to control the temperature . the paths over which the integration is performed are sampled with a step of @xmath64 0.001a@xmath65 ( a@xmath65 is the bto lattice constant obtained from the lda = 7.46 a.u . from ref .  ] ) . each simulation with fixed polarization",
    "is performed on 10@xmath66 steps , the thermal averages being computed on the 50000 last steps . the time step is fixed to 2 @xmath63 10@xmath67 s. all the free energy curves presented herafter are performed at _ fixed strain tensor _ , and each curve corresponds to a fixed temperature , to ensure we calculate a ( helmholtz ) free energy curve @xmath68 .    the thermodynamic integration along the @xmath45 direction is simply performed , from zero to @xmath69 , via : @xmath70 the thermal average being performed for each value of k under fixed polarization ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "we apply our method to the case of batio@xmath1 under fixed volume .",
    "this system has been studied very soon , and it was suggested from landau theory@xcite that bto under fixed volume might undergo a second - order phase transition at the curie temperature .",
    "several experiments@xcite have confirmed that clamped batio@xmath1 has the coefficient of @xmath72 ( in the landau - devonshire expansion ) positive , making the paraelectric - ferroelectric transition of second order .",
    "we first focus on bto constrained to have a cubic unit cell , with a strain tensor frozen to the values found in its high - temperature cubic phase from direct md simulations@xcite : @xmath730.0121 and @xmath74=0.0 .",
    "this corresponds to a lattice constant of 3.995  .",
    "we note that these strains result from the application of a negative pressure -4.8 gpa ( _ i.e. _ positive stress tensor @xmath754.8 gpa ) , which is the one used by zhong _ et al_@xcite to correct the underestimation of the lattice constant by the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "moreover , the strain is defined here with respect to this cubic lda ground state ( lattice constant 7.46 a.u . ) .    using the nos - hoover md method , we first perform simulations to determine the temperature evolution of the polarization and the possible phase transitions .",
    "in fact we only find one phase transition in that case , from cubic ( high t ) to rhombohedral ( low t ) ( fig .  [ cubique2 ] ) at @xmath76 280 k. zhong _",
    "et al_@xcite have already noticed this point through mc simulations on bto , but with a homogeneous strain tensor frozen entirely to zero .",
    "moreover , the transition seems to be second order or at least weakly first - order ( the fluctuations just below the curie temperature are very large and finite - size effects make the polarization flip from a direction to another , which makes it difficult to discriminate ) .",
    "we now turn to thermodynamic integration for a set of selected temperatures surrounding the curie temperature : t=320 , 300 , 280 , 260 and 240 k. we perform the integration along two paths starting from @xmath52 and going to @xmath77 ( along [ 100 ] ) and to @xmath78 ( along [ 111 ] ) . the free energy , resulting from the integration of the thermal averages of the total forces along the second path ( _ i.e. _ along [ 111 ] ) , is shown on fig .  [ cubique1 ] .",
    "the minima of the free energy are reported on fig .",
    "[ cubique2 ] ( orange circles ) for the five temperatures : _ as expected , the results obtained by direct molecular dynamics correspond to the minima of the free energy .",
    "_ we have also computed the profile of the free energy along the [ 100 ] direction , leading to globally higher free energies than along [ 111 ] .",
    "interestingly , the rhombohedral ferroelectric phase obtained at low temperature does not exhibit shear strain ( since shear strain is fixed to zero ) as it would be the case for a stress - free crystal . instead , we observe a shear stress , as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ stress ] ( inset ) : the non - diagonal components of the stress tensor are not zero at low temperature and decrease to zero at the transition .      as another example , we freeze the strain to the values found in the tetragonal phase at t=280 k , _ i.e. _ @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( as in the previous case , these strains corresponds to a negative hydrostatic pressure of -4.8 gpa at this temperature ) . the corresponding lattice constants are a=4.017  and b = c=3.988  .",
    "we first perform direct molecular dynamics simulations from t=260 to 400k ( fig .",
    "[ tetra2 ] ) .",
    "the system slowly evolves from ferroelectric to paraelectric , the transition temperature being at @xmath76 t=375 k.    we also calculate under this fixed strain tensor the free energy as a function of @xmath81 ( with @xmath82 ) , for eight temperatures ( from 260 to 380k ) and plot it on fig .",
    "[ tetra1 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath81 directly found by molecular dynamics correspond to the minima of the landau free energy curve , as expected ( the values minimizing the free energy are reported on fig .",
    "[ tetra2 ] , in orange circles ) .",
    "interestingly , the transition is also second order or weakly first - order : within the numerical accuracy of our calculations , the evolution of the landau free energy curves as a function of temperature follow the well - known trends of second order transitions , with a continuous evolution from a double - well to a single - well ( with minimum at zero ) curve .    in the range of temperature considered ( 260 - 400k ) , we do not find any orthorhombic phase .",
    "such a phase naturally appears when the simulation is performed under fixed pressure and not under fixed volume@xcite .",
    "the second - order ( or weakly first - order ) character of the two phase transitions is illustrated by the temperature evolution of the stress tensor components ( fig .",
    "[ stress ] ) , that do not exhibit discontinuities at the phase transition .      since the work of devonshire",
    ", the thermodynamics of barium titanate has been the subject of many phenomenological studies , and several landau potentials have been proposed as expansions in power series of @xmath0 up to 6@xmath83 or 8@xmath83 order for this material .",
    "the landau potential is more often given as a gibbs free energy and for a stress - free crystal ( @xmath84=0 ) .",
    "converting to an helmholtz free energy@xcite , @xmath85 usually writes as the sum of three terms , in which it appears as a function of temperature , strain tensor @xmath86 and polarization :    @xmath87    in which @xmath86 denotes the strain tensor ( given in voigt notations ) and    @xmath88    @xmath89    where the @xmath90 are the elastic constants ,    @xmath91    where the @xmath92 are the electrostrictive coefficients .    the coefficients entering the expression of @xmath93 are the same as those entering the free energy of the stress - free crystal , excepting the 4@xmath83-order coefficients , that must be renormalized@xcite .",
    "these renormalized 4@xmath83-order coefficients @xmath94 and @xmath95 are calculated from @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( from the stress - free crystal ) and from the elastic and electrostrictive coefficients@xcite . in the following",
    ", we will use the values of ref .   to calculate these renormalized coefficients .",
    "this function @xmath98 should be directly comparable to the free energy we have calculated by thermodynamic integration .",
    "we will restrain to the comparison with two recent studies that have proposed 8@xmath83-order expansions of the landau free energy : li _ et al_@xcite and wang _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "however , the reader must be cautionned that the comparison is not always relevant for the following reasons :    \\(i ) the strains have not the same reference in the two models : in the effective hamiltonian the strain is defined with respect to the cubic @xmath99 lda ground state ( lattice constant 7.46 a.u . ) , which causes problems in the comparison of the quadratic coefficients of @xmath100 .",
    "\\(ii ) the effective hamiltonian has a curie temperature @xmath76 120 k lower than the true one .",
    "thus the quadratic coefficient , that is expected to evolve with t as @xmath101 , will be naturally strongly shifted with respect to the phenomenological potentials , that reproduce much better the transition temperatures .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , some free energy curves can give very different coefficients according to the degree of the polynomial function with which they are fitted .",
    "for these reasons , we have prefered to plot the quadratic coefficient as obtained from our calculations without correction . from a general point of view",
    ", the coefficients fitted on our data have orders of magnitude in good agreement with the phenomenological potentials , although their temperature evolution appears as more complex , as already pointed out by i@xmath12iguez _",
    "et al_@xcite .      in the first case studied ( isotropic strain ) , we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "thus the free energy writes :    @xmath104    the curves of fig .",
    "[ cubique1 ] have been fitted on 8@xmath83 order polynomial functions ( without odd term ) .",
    "the coefficients of the high - order terms give access to complex combinations of the @xmath45 coefficients ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath107 is plotted on fig .  [ landau_quartic]-a together with @xmath108 calculated from the potentials of wang _ et al _ and _",
    "li et al_. it falls just between the two and has the same sign as that of wang .    the coefficient of @xmath109 is plotted on fig .",
    "[ landau_quadratic]-a as well as @xmath110 calculated from the potentials of wang _ et al _ and _ li",
    "et al_. as already said , they are not directly comparable since under fixed strain , @xmath110 should be renormalized by a constant term @xmath111 .",
    "anyway the slopes are close .",
    "the term found from our calculation approximately varies with t as @xmath101 with @xmath112 270k , which roughly corresponds to the transition temperature in the isotropic strain case .      in the tetragonal case",
    ", we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the landau free energy writes :    @xmath115    then , as in the previous section , we have fitted the curves of fig .  [ tetra1 ] obtained by the thermodynamic integration by polynomial functions up to 8@xmath83 order .",
    "for each temperature , we get a set of 4 coefficients that we now compare to the ones of wang _ el al _ and li _",
    "et al_.    the highest order terms should directly correspond to the @xmath116 and @xmath117 coefficients .",
    "the values provided by our data correspond very well to the phenomenological ones above @xmath76 325 k ( fig .  [ landau_tetra1 ] ) .",
    "below this temperature , these coefficients strongly vary .",
    "the variation of the @xmath107 coefficient , that should compare directly to @xmath94 , reveals more complex ( fig .",
    "[ landau_quartic]-b ) , as well as that of the quadratic one ( fig .",
    "[ landau_quadratic]-b ) .",
    "in this work , we have proposed and validated a method to calculate numerically the landau free energy of a ferroelectric material , without any assumption on its analytical form and using the effective hamiltonian of zhong _",
    "et al_@xcite directly fitted on first - principles calculations .",
    "it is based on the technique of the thermodynamic integration coupled with molecular dynamics performed at fixed temperature ( nos - hoover ) and fixed polarization along paths in the 3-d space ( p@xmath13 , p@xmath14 , p@xmath15 ) .",
    "although possible also with monte carlo simulations , molecular dynamics is well suited to this kind of problem since thermodynamic integration requires to calculate the forces , directly available within md .",

    "the results have been compared with some available phenomenological potentials .",

    "the next step is to extend the simulations to the isothermal - isobaric ensemble to obtain the gibbs free energy as a function of polarization .",
    "this will be achieved by coupling nos - hoover , parinello - rahman and also fixed polarization molecular dynamics .",
    "other extensions of this approach can be imagined , such as the computation of entropy profiles as a function of @xmath0 , the application to low - dimensional systems and to complex perovskite ( with antiferrodistortions ) and multiferroic materials , where the free energy could be computed as a function of polarization and tilt angle or magnetization@xcite .",

    "this is more obvious by rewriting : @xmath141 ,    @xmath142    the derivative with respect to @xmath32 is : @xmath143    which can be rewritten :    @xmath144    one recognizes the thermal average ( under fixed polarization ) in the canonical ensemble of the microscopic quantity @xmath145 .",
    "this quantity is in fact : @xmath146 in which @xmath147 is the force acting on the n@xmath83 local mode .    and finally ,    @xmath148    it is clear that the n@xmath83 local mode does not have a particular role .",

    "these equations are integrated numerically within the well - known verlet algorithm@xcite : the local mode at time @xmath161 ( @xmath162 is the time step ) is computed from the local modes at @xmath163 and @xmath164 , using the forces calculated at @xmath163 :    @xmath165    and idem for the displacement modes .",

    "this method consists in adding to the system a fictitious degree of freedom @xmath166 representing the thermostat , and that couples to the equations of motion , according to :    @xmath167    @xmath168    @xmath169    where t(t ) and t@xmath65 are respectively the instantaneous and targetted temperature , @xmath170 is the number of degrees of freedom in the system , and @xmath171 .",
