    "but , motivated by analogy with infinite barrier potentials to the linear wave equation @xmath26}(x ) \\phi$ ] with initial data smooth and supported on @xmath10 $ ] , a simple compactness argument ( or explicit computation ) shows that @xmath8 converges ( in , say , the uniform topology ) to the solution to the free wave equation @xmath27 on @xmath28 $ ] with the reflective ( dirichlet ) boundary conditions @xmath29 .",
    "] , one might wish to interpret the infinite nonlinearity @xmath30 as some sort of `` barrier nonlinearity '' which is constraining @xmath8 to have magnitude at most @xmath31 , but otherwise has no effect .",
    "intuitively , we thus expect the limiting wave @xmath9 to evolve like the linear wave equation until it reaches the threshold @xmath32 or @xmath33 , at which point it should `` reflect '' off the nonlinear barrier in does not directly make sense ) , and so energy should be reflected rather than absorbed by the barrier . ] . the purpose of this paper is to make the above intuition rigorous , and to give a precise interpretation for the equation .",
    "to get some further intuition as to this reflection phenomenon , let us first study ( non - rigorously ) the simpler ode problem , in which we look at solutions @xmath34 to the ode @xmath35 with fixed initial data @xmath36 with @xmath37 , and with @xmath4 . from the conserved energy @xmath38 ( and recalling that @xmath39 ) we quickly obtain the uniform bounds @xmath40 and all times @xmath41 , where the implied constants in the @xmath42 notation depend on @xmath5 .",
    "thus we already see a barrier effect preventing @xmath8 from going too far outside of the interval @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "to investigate what happens near a time @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is close to ( say ) @xmath45 , let us make the ansatz @xmath46 observe from that @xmath47 is positive for @xmath48 and some constant @xmath49 depending only on @xmath50 .",

    "these solutions asymptotically approach @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "thus we see that if @xmath52 is large and negative but with positive velocity , then the solution to this ode will be approximately linear until @xmath52 approaches the origin , where it will dwell for a bounded amount of time before reflecting back into the negative axis with the opposite velocity to its initial velocity . undoing the rescaling , we thus expect the limit @xmath24 of the original ode solutions @xmath23 to also behave linearly until reaching @xmath65 or @xmath66 , at which point they should reflect with equal and opposite velocity , so that @xmath9 will eventually be a sawtooth function with range @xmath10 $ ] ( except of course in the degenerate case @xmath67 , @xmath68 , in which case @xmath9 should be constant ) . because the ode can be solved more or less explicitly using the conserved hamiltonian , it is not difficult to formalise these heuristics rigorously ; we leave this as an exercise to the interested reader .",
    "note that the above analysis also suggests a more precise asymptotic for how reflections of @xmath23 should behave for large @xmath69 , namely ( assuming @xmath70 for simplicity ) @xmath71 or ( after taylor expansion ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 measures the speed of the reflection , and @xmath43 the time at which reflection occurs , and we are deliberately being vague as to what the symbol @xmath74 means .    adapting the above ode analysis to the pde setting , we can now study the reflection behaviour of @xmath23 near the nonlinear barrier @xmath75 at some point @xmath76 in spacetime by introducing the ansatz @xmath77 where @xmath52 can be computed to solve the equation @xmath78 in the region where @xmath8 is near @xmath31 ( and is in particular non - negative ) . in the limit @xmath4",

    "( defect measure ) we have @xmath110 in the sense of distributions , where @xmath111 are locally finite non - negative measures supported on the sets @xmath112 , @xmath113 respectively .",
    "* ( null energy reflection ) for almost every @xmath114 , we have explicitly from in terms of the initial data as @xmath115 and @xmath116 . ]",
    "@xmath117 is almost everywhere equal to a function of @xmath118 only , and similarly for @xmath119 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of @xmath8 obeying the above properties is not obvious , but is part of the theorem .",
    "the conditions ( i)-(vi ) are thus the rigorous substitute for the non - rigorous equation ; they superficially resemble a `` viscosity solution '' or `` kinetic formulation '' of ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it would be interesting to see if there is any rigorous connection here to the kinetic theory of conservation laws .    the hypotheses ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) on the initial data @xmath5 are somewhat stronger than what is likely to be needed for the theorem to hold ; in particular , one should be able to relax the strict barrier condition ( b ) to @xmath120 , and also omit the non - degeneracy condition ( c ) , although the conclusions ( ii ) , ( iii ) the limit @xmath8 would have to be modified in this case ; one also expects to be able to relax the smoothness assumption ( a ) , perhaps all the way to the energy class or possibly even the bounded variation class .",
    "we will not pursue these matters here .      to illustrate the reflection in action ,",
    "let us restrict attention to the triangular region @xmath121 and consider the initial data @xmath5 associated to the linear solution @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a small constant ( e.g. @xmath124 is safe ) .",
    "observe that @xmath125 lies between @xmath126 and @xmath31 for most of @xmath127 , but exceeds @xmath31 in the disk @xmath128 .",
    "thus we expect @xmath8 to follow @xmath125 until it encounters this disk , at which point it should reflect .",
    "the actual solution @xmath8 can be described using figure [ fig1 ] . in region",
    "i , @xmath8 is equal to the linear solution @xmath125 . but",
    "@xmath125 exceeds @xmath31 once one passes the circular arc joining @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and so a reflection must occur in region ii ; indeed , one has @xmath131 in this region .",
    "once the solution passes @xmath129 and @xmath130 , though , it turns out that the downward velocity of the reflected wave is now sufficient to drag @xmath8 off of the singular set ( which , in this case , are the left and right arcs of the circle @xmath132 ) are not used as a reflective set for @xmath8 . ]",
    "@xmath133 ( which , in this example , is the circular arc connecting @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) . indeed , in region iii",
    ", we have @xmath134 ( note that this is the unique solution to the free wave equation that matches up with @xmath8 on regions i , ii ) and similarly on region iv we have @xmath135 finally , on region v we have another solution to the free wave equation , which is now on a downward trajectory away from @xmath65 : @xmath136 if one were to continue the evolution of @xmath8 forward in time beyond @xmath127 ( extending the initial data @xmath5 suitably ) , the solution would eventually hit the @xmath66 barrier and reflect again , picking up further singularities propagating in null directions similar to those pictured here .",
    "thus , while the solution remains piecewise smooth for all time , we expect the number of singularities to increase as time progresses , due to the increasing number of reflections taking place .",
    "it is a routine matter to verify that the solution presented here verifies the properties ( i)-(vi ) on @xmath127 ( if @xmath137 is sufficiently small ) , and so is necessarily the limiting solution @xmath8 , thanks to theorem [ main - thm ] ( and the uniqueness theory in section [ unique - sec ] below ) . we omit the details .",
    "the circular arc between @xmath129 and @xmath130 supports a component of the defect measure @xmath138 , which can be computed explicitly from the above formulae .",
    "the defect measure can also be computed by integrating and observing that @xmath139 whenever @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 are the corners of a small parallelogram intersecting this arc . sending @xmath144 ( say ) , we observe that the left - hand side is asymptotic to @xmath145 . since @xmath146 reflects in sign across the arc , we can simplify this as @xmath147 .",
    "this allows us to describe @xmath138 explicitly in terms of the conserved quantity @xmath148 and the slope of the arc ; we omit the details .",
    "the above example shows that the barrier set @xmath149 has some overlap initially with the set @xmath150 , but the situation becomes more complicated after multiple `` reflections '' off of the two barriers @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and the author does not know of a clean way to describe this set for large times @xmath41 , although as the above example suggests , these sets should be computable for any given choice of @xmath41 and any given initial data .",
    "we shall shortly discuss the proof of theorem [ main - thm ] , but let us first pause to discuss two techniques that initially look promising for solving this problem , but end up being problematic for a number of reasons .",
    "each of the nonlinear wave equations enjoy a conserved stress - energy tensor @xmath151 , and it is tempting to try to show that this stress - energy tensor converges to a limit @xmath152 .",
    "however , the author found it difficult to relate this limit tensor to the limit solution @xmath9 .",
    "the key technical difficulty was that while it was not difficult to ensure that derivatives @xmath153 of @xmath23 converged in a weak sense to the derivatives @xmath154 of a limit @xmath9 , this did not imply that the _ magnitudes _ @xmath155 , @xmath156 of the derivatives converged ( weakly ) to the expected limit of @xmath157 , @xmath158 , due to the possibility of increasing oscillations in the sign of @xmath159 or @xmath160 in the limit @xmath4 which could cause some loss of mass in the limit . because of this , much of the argument is instead focused on controlling this oscillation , and the stress - energy tensor conservation appears to be of limited use for such an objective .",
    "instead , the argument relies much more heavily on pointwise conservation ( or almost - conservation ) laws such as , and on the method of characteristics .",
    "another possible approach would be to try to construct an approximate solution ( or parametrix ) to @xmath23 , along the lines of , and show that @xmath23 is close enough to the approximate solution that the convergence can be read off directly ( much as it can be from ) .",
    "while it does seem possible to construct the approximate solution more or less explicitly , the author was unable to find a sufficiently strong stability theory to then close the argument by comparing the exact solution to the approximate solution .",
    "the difficulty is that the standard stability theory for ( e.g. by applying energy estimates to the difference equation ) exhibits losses which grow exponentially in time with rate proportional to @xmath69 , thus requiring the accuracy of the approximate solution to be exponentially small in @xmath69 before there is hope of connecting the approximate solution to the exact one . because of this , the proof below avoids all use of perturbation theory . ] , and instead estimates the nonlinear solutions @xmath23 directly .",
    "it may however be of interest to develop a stability theory for which is more uniform in @xmath69 ( perhaps using bounded variation type norms rather than energy space norms ? ) .",
    "one starting point may be the perturbation theory for , explored recently in @xcite .",
    "our arguments are instead based on a compactness method .",
    "it is not difficult to use energy conservation to demonstrate equicontinuity and uniform boundedness in the @xmath23 , so we know ( from the arzel - ascoli theorem ) that the @xmath23 have at least one limit point .",
    "it thus suffices to show that all such limit points obey the properties ( i)-(vi ) , and that the properties ( i)-(vi ) uniquely determine @xmath8 .",
    "the uniqueness is established in section [ unique - sec ] , and is based on many applications of the method of characteristics . to establish",
    "that all limit points obey ( i)-(vi ) , we first establish in section [ apriori ] a number of _ a priori _ estimates on the solutions @xmath23 , in particular obtaining some crucial boundedness and oscillation control on @xmath8 and its first derivatives , uniformly in @xmath69 . in section [ compact - sec ]",
    "we then take limits along some subsequence of @xmath69 going to infinity to recover the desired properties ( i)-(vi ) .",
    "it seems of interest to obtain more robust methods for proving results for infinite nonlinear barriers ; the arguments here rely heavily on the method of characteristics and so do not seem to easily extend to , say , the @xmath4 limit of the one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath161 , or to higher - dimensional non - linear wave equations . in higher dimensions",
    "there is also a serious additional problem , namely that the nonlinearity becomes energy - critical in the limit @xmath4 in two dimensions , and ( even worse ) becomes energy - supercritical for large @xmath69 in three and higher dimensions .",
    "however , while global existence for defocusing supercritical non - linear wave equations from large data is a notoriously difficult open problem , there is the remote possibility that the asymptotic case @xmath4 is actually better behaved than that of a fixed @xmath69 . at the very least",

    "but on the line @xmath572 that that edge lies on , we have holding in @xmath539 outside of @xmath450 intervals of length @xmath573 ; also , by hypothesis , we have @xmath574 for @xmath171 in @xmath539 . we conclude ( for @xmath564 large enough ) that there are at most @xmath450 subdiamonds with northwest edge lying on this line @xmath572 for which @xmath565 changes sign on this edge . summing over all @xmath571 possible edges",
    ", we obtain the claim .",
    "fix @xmath137 , and let @xmath575 .",
    "the set of subdiamonds on which @xmath526 is totally positive or totally negative can change with @xmath564 ; however there are only a finite number of possible values for this set for fixed @xmath137 .",
    "hence , by the infinite pigeonhole principle , we may refine the sequence @xmath576 and assume that these sets are in fact independent of @xmath564 .",
    "for any totally positive or totally negative diamond , @xmath565 has a definite sign ; since @xmath565 converges weakly to @xmath206 , we conclude that @xmath577 converges weakly to @xmath555",
    ". since there are no sign changes on this diamond , must hold throughout the subdiamond ( by the intermediate value theorem ) ; we thus conclude that holds on any such subdiamond .",
    "since the measure of all the degenerate sub - diamonds is @xmath578 , we conclude that holds on @xmath539 outside of a set of measure @xmath578 .",
    "letting @xmath579 we obtain the claim .",
    "the only remaining property we need to verify is ( ii ) . by spatial reflection symmetry",
    ", it suffices to show that for each @xmath447 $ ] , the map @xmath580 is piecewise smooth on @xmath581 $ ] , with only finitely many pieces .    from ( c ) , we know that @xmath582 vanishes for @xmath118 in a finite union of intervals and points in @xmath581 $ ] .",
    "on any one of these intervals , we know from ( vi ) that @xmath583 also vanishes almost everywhere , which by the lipschitz nature of @xmath8 and the fundamental theorem of calculus ensures that @xmath584 is constant in @xmath118 on each of these intervals , for any fixed @xmath179 .",
    "so it will suffice to verify the piecewise smoothness of @xmath585 for any @xmath179 and on any compact interval @xmath449 of @xmath118 for which @xmath582 is bounded away from zero , so long as the number of pieces is bounded uniformly in @xmath449 and @xmath179 .",
    "fix @xmath449 and @xmath179 . by hypothesis",
    ", we can find @xmath443 such that @xmath586 for all @xmath446 ; in particular , @xmath587 does not change sign on this interval . by lemma [ piece ] , we conclude for each @xmath564 that @xmath588 for @xmath446 outside of @xmath450 intervals of length @xmath589 intersecting @xmath449 .    by pigeonholing , we may assume that the number @xmath590 of such intervals is constant ; denoting the midpoints of these intervals by @xmath591 ; without loss of generality we may take @xmath592 and @xmath593 to be the endpoints of @xmath449 .",
    "we may assume from the bolzano - weierstrass theorem and passing to a further subsequence that each of the @xmath594 converge to some limit @xmath595 .    between @xmath594 and @xmath596 , excluding those @xmath118 lying within @xmath589 of either endpoint , we may write @xmath597 , where @xmath598 . by a further pigeonholing we may take @xmath599 independent of @xmath564 . using the fundamental theorem of calculus and then taking limits ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath174 is piecewise smooth for @xmath446 , with possible discontinuities at @xmath600 , and with @xmath174 equal to @xmath601 on the interval @xmath602 for any @xmath603 .",
