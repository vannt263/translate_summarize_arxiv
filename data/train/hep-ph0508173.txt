    "precision measurements at the lep collider at cern and other colliders like e.g.  slc at slac , tevatron at fermilab and hera at desy have reached a precision which has exceeded all expectations .",
    "this is true especially for electron colliders  @xcite . at the moment",
    "the precision of measurements related to the parameters of the standard model of electroweak interactions reaches values up to @xmath4  @xcite . at future colliders like the lhc or the ilc ( including gigaz ) ,",
    "further improvements are expected  @xcite .",
    "compared to this , theoretical predictions accomplish this precision only in very few cases . to check the validity of the standard model and to be able to draw conclusions about `` new physics '' , progress in theoretical methods and their application is necessary  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the calculations and the number of the graphs which have to be calculated within perturbation theory grows considerably order by order . at second order",
    "only a few observables are calculated  @xcite .",
    "still there is no method available which allows for the ( semi)automatic calculation of arbitrary processes at this order .",
    "much work has been done on nnlo calculations  @xcite . while for mixing qcd and electroweak @xmath5 nnlo vertex corrections a few calculations were done several years ago  @xcite , for the evaluation of two - loop three - point diagrams in the general mass case only the methods proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite have been used successfully in order to calculate electroweak nnlo corrections  @xcite . with increasing energy as it will be used at the ilc , radiative corrections will become increasingly important",
    ". therefore , there is still need for independent methods to calculate general massive two - loop vertex diagrams .",
    "in this paper we present a new algorithm which allows one to calculate nnlo - corrections for general massive planar two - loop vertex functions as they arise in the standard model of electroweak interactions using feynman gauge , e.g.  for the effective weak mixing angle @xmath6  @xcite occuring in @xmath7 and for other processes like @xmath8 .",
    "even though the calculation of particular physical processes is not subject of this paper , the new algorithm enables one to perform such calculations . for our algorithm",
    "we use the parallel / orthogonal space method  @xcite which allows one to separate effects coming from inner momenta from those of momenta of the outer particles of the process .",
    "the benefit of the parallel / orthogonal space method is the fact that the calculation stays close to the physical process .",
    "the introduction of feynman parameters and the application of the wick rotation which estrange the calculation from the physical process for other methods are not necessary for the parallel / orthogonal space method . instead",
    ", a decay process can be calculated in the rest frame of the decaying particle .",
    "the introduction of gram determinants which might cause artificial divergences is not necessary .",
    "the analytical integration leads to still rather simple basic functions like logarithms and dilogarithms . for the remaining numerical integration",
    "the integrand can be analyzed at physical thresholds .",
    "landau singularities are mirrored directly onto the parameters of the integrands .",
    "finally , the method is totally independent from other methods and therefore allows for an independent check .    up to now",
    ", the parallel / orthogonal space method was used successfully to evaluate the general massive scalar integrals in the case of the planar topology  @xcite and in the case of the crossed topology  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not possible to evaluate two - loop three - point functions which contain loop momenta in the numerator .",
    "the method proposed in this paper allows one to calculate also tensor integrals for the planar vertex topologies .",
    "we present a tensor reduction which reduces the planar and rotated reduced planar two - loop three - point topologies containing an arbitrary tensor structure to a set of master integrals with strongly restricted numerator structure  @xcite . as for most of the master integrals which remain after tensor reduction",
    "there are already established methods available  @xcite , we do not give results in these cases . the same is valid for particular mass cases  @xcite and for the uv - singular parts  @xcite .",
    "efficient methods for several cases including few masses have been developed in refs .",
    "we also do not dwell on the calculation of massless diagrams for which other methods are applied successfully ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as ir divergences occur in this case",
    ", there is no systematic method available within the parallel / orthogonal space method because for each special case the subtraction has to be found seperately `` by hand ''  @xcite .",
    "instead , we concentrate on the most complicated part , namely the calculation of the uv - finite parts of those master integrals which keep the planar or rotated reduced planar topology after tensor reduction .",
    "two - loop integration in four - dimensional space - time needs eight integration steps . using the parallel / orthogonal space method , we can do six of them analytically using different techniques .",
    "the last two integration steps are done numerically .",
    "because most of the integrations can be performed analytically , the landau singularities of the feynman diagrams can be related graphically to the integrands in the remaining two - dimensional integration region . using different algorithms",
    ", we demonstrate the numerical stability .",
    "the algorithm for the numerical calculation of the last two integrations is developed and its reliability is demonstrated .",
    "in addition , further exhaustive numerical tests are done . while for the numerical integration programs like the monte carlo integration routine vegas  @xcite and the program divonne of the library cuba  @xcite are used , the implementation of the algorithms for the semi - automatical calculation in xloops  @xcite is part of the work described in this paper . in the xloops - ginac project developed by the members of the thep working group in mainz  @xcite ,",
    "work on the automatic generation of feynman diagrams and their evaluation with analytical and numerical means is in progress . for this purpose",
    "the language for algebraic calculation ginac was developed  @xcite . while most of the master two - loop integrals not considered in this paper are already implemented in xloops ,",
    "the missing planar topologies will be added in the course of the work introduced here .",
    "the complete set of algorithms described in this paper is implemented under xloops - ginac .",
    "however , the implementation of parts of the algorithms for known topologies as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sumredpro ] still has to be done . because in this spirit the implementation is not yet finished , the calculation of physical processes is not subject of this paper but will be presented in a future publication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the main tools of the analytical calculation associated with the parallel / orthogonal space method . the tensor reduction procedure is explained in detail in sec .  3 for the non - reduced planar two - loop three - point diagram , and modifications in case of the rotated reduced planar diagrams are mentioned and explained .",
    "the tensor reduction leads to master integrals which are integrated analytically in sec .  4 up to the last two integrations .",
    "in sec .  5 we deal with the analysis of landau singularities and thresholds .",
    "6 is devoted to the numerical integration . in both sections we present examples to show the reliability of our procedure . in sec .",
    "7 we give our conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we deal with the integral basis .",
    "in this section we provide the reader with the tools necessary for the calculation of massive two - loop tensor vertex integrals .",
    "most of the tools were already introduced in the literature  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can be brief in presenting these tools .",
    "the integrals we have to calculate are determined by the two momenta of the produced particles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . because the integrals are expressed in terms of covariant quantities , we are free to decompose any loop momentum @xmath11 into two covariant vectors , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 has components in the _ parallel space _ which is the linear span of the external momenta @xmath14 , while @xmath15 is the orthogonal complement with @xmath16 with components in the _ orthogonal space _  @xcite . for three - point functions",
    "we can consider the process in the rest frame of the decaying particle . in this frame",
    "the two emerging particles are produced back - to - back , defining the @xmath17-axis .- component will be written as the second component of the four - vector in the following . ] in this frame the representation @xmath18 can be used where @xmath19 is the momentum of the decaying particle with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "accordingly , the loop momenta @xmath11 and @xmath22 necessary for the description of the two - loop integral are parametrized by  @xcite @xmath23 the two - dimensional vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 are represented in polar coordinates , using the squared absolute values @xmath26 and @xmath27 and two angles , the angle @xmath28 of @xmath24 with the @xmath29-axis and the relative angle @xmath30",
    ". we can write @xmath31 the choice of parallel and orthogonal subspaces itself is lorentz invariant , so that the calculation can still be done in any lorentz frame .",
    "the benefit of the parallel / orthogonal space method ( p / o - space method ) is that the contributions belonging to the orthogonal space can be integrated out and we are left with the contributions in parallel space only .",
    "the integration measure is accordingly written as @xmath32 where the trivial integration over @xmath28 has already been performed .      using feynman gauge ,",
    "the denominators of integrals occurring in two - loop vertex calculations contain up to six propagator factors .",
    "a typical factor is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in the p",
    "/ o - space representation this propagator factor reads @xmath35 if we replace @xmath36 , we obtain @xmath37 where @xmath38 no longer appears quadratically .",
    "this replacement , also known as _ linearization _ , is allowed because the integral for @xmath39 ranges from @xmath40 to @xmath41 . however , because of the occurrence of the mixing propagator factor @xmath42 the signs for the linearizations in @xmath11 and @xmath22 are coupled . in applications of this linearization we use the sign which is the most appropriate for our aims .",
    "the benefit of the linearization is that the integrals over @xmath38 and @xmath43 can then be calculated by using the residue theorem .",
    "the quantity @xmath17 occurs only in the just mentioned propagator factor @xmath44 .",
    "after linearization this propagator factor can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath44 occurs only once in the denominator ( if at all ) .",
    "the resulting integral @xmath47}{(a+i\\eta)^2-b^2 } }    = \\frac\\pi{{\\sqrt[\\star]}{(a+i\\eta)^2 - 4st}}\\ ] ] can be written in this closed form only if we make a convention different from the usual one  @xcite .",
    "we stipulate that the cut of the square root is located on the positive real axis instead of the negative one . for this reason",
    "we have added the star in @xmath48{(a+i\\eta)^2-b^2}$ ] which reminds one of the different cut .",
    "the occurrence of the modified square root has consequences for the subsequent integrations because in closing paths for the residue theorem we have to avoid crossing this cut . in order to find conditions for this we split the square root up into a product of two square roots @xmath49}{a\\pm b+i\\eta}$ ] .",
    "if one of the radicands is equal to a positive real number @xmath29 , we are definitely crossing the cut .",
    "written in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath50 note that the two undetermined signs are not correlated . while the sign between @xmath51 and @xmath52 depends on which of the two square roots is taken , the global sign of the right hand side is due to the sign of the linearization . considering only the linearizations @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the signs of the real and imaginary part of the cut still depend on the sign of @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 , the cut is located in the lower complex half plane . the real part starts ( for @xmath57 ) at some finite value and runs to @xmath41 , independent of which square root we selected . in order to avoid the cut",
    ", we therefore have to close the integration path for @xmath38 resp .",
    "@xmath43 in the upper complex half plane while for @xmath58 we have to close it in the lower half plane .",
    "the situation is opposite for the linearization with a minus sign .",
    "after having introduced the main tools for the calculation , we can start with the calculation itself .",
    "the starting point is the tensor integral @xmath59 where @xmath60 if one is doing standard model calculations using feynman gauge , the powers are restricted by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as well as by @xmath63 and @xmath64 . nevertheless , the algorithm introduced in this paper works for general powers . in fig .  [ momflow ]",
    "we show the momentum flow for the diagram in order to define the momenta .    for the indices",
    "@xmath65 we allow non - negative integer values . in performing the tensor reduction",
    "the integrals are simplified to integrals with simpler numerator and/or denominator structure .    for one - loop integrals the numerator",
    "can always be removed by reduction procedures @xcite . for two - loop integrals this need not be the case .",
    "in general there are not enough propagator factors to cancel all components of the numerator that occur . for the genuine planar two - loop three - point function",
    "all numerator factors related to the second loop momentum @xmath22 can be cancelled .",
    "this is not the case for the reduced topologies , and it is not the case for the first loop momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the aim of the tensor reduction in general is to reduce the numerator as far as possible so that the integrations can be performed similar to what is done for a trivial numerator  @xcite .",
    "the reduction procedure will be explained in the following .",
    "the representation of the procedure by diagrams will show the topologies only . in this spirit plus",
    "signs like the one occuring in eq .",
    "( [ diagmix0 ] ) have to be understood as sums over diagrams with the same topology but different factors and signs .",
    "the first step in the cancellation procedure consist in cancelling powers of the mixed factor @xmath66 .",
    "this factor occurs also in the propagator factor @xmath44 .",
    "we can write @xmath67 where @xmath68 used iteratively , we obtain @xmath69 this iterative formula is necessary because the propagator factor @xmath44 occurs only once .",
    "as applied to the integral , we obtain @xmath70 where we have skipped all the other numerator factors for convenience .",
    "the first part is the same planar integral with a different numerator structure .",
    "however , the second part no longer contains the mixing propagator factor @xmath44 .",
    "instead , the diagram factorizes .",
    "in addition , we can conclude that this vanishes if @xmath71 is odd .",
    "the reason is that the integration over @xmath17 is given by @xmath72 which vanishes if the integrand is odd .",
    "diagramatically we can write @xmath73 after having cancelled the mixing part it is irrelevant with which loop momentum we continue . however , we always start with the orthogonal space components .",
    "the factor @xmath75 occurs in the denominator factor @xmath76 .",
    "we can write @xmath77 the iterative formula @xmath78 can be used for the integral to obtain @xmath79 schematically this reduction reads @xmath80 in the following only the diagrammatic reduction will be shown .      in anticipation of the linearization we replace the numerator factors @xmath38 by @xmath81 , using @xmath82",
    "while the additional factors @xmath83 will be cancelled together with @xmath84 in the next step , the subsequent linearization will replace @xmath85 by @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath87 are the only propagator factors that contain only @xmath11 and not @xmath22 .",
    "we can combine these both to obtain @xmath88 an iterative formula can be constructed as before , the reduction reads @xmath89      in using @xmath91 we can cancel the factors @xmath90 , ending up with the reduction scheme @xmath92      different from the situation for the replacement of @xmath38 , we have three propagator factors which do not contain @xmath11 . in this case the factors @xmath43 can be cancelled completely .",
    "we use @xmath93 to reduce powers of @xmath43 according to the scheme @xmath94      finally , we can cancel the factors @xmath95 as well , using @xmath96 the reduction scheme reads @xmath97      after performing the reduction procedure , we can collect all the steps into a single one .",
    "all diagrams which are still of the ( original ) planar topology after reduction procedure have a numerator factor @xmath85 in different powers . the maximal power , i.e.  the maximal value for @xmath28 , is given by @xmath98 .",
    "the numerator factors of the diagrams with reduced topology are changed but not easier . nevertheless , because of the different topology , reduction procedures which are known in the literature or which will be explained in the following can be applied .",
    "schematically we write @xmath99 denoting the topologies by @xmath100 according to the cancelled propagator factor , we can cite the following references :    * _ two - loop three - point functions with two - point subloop _ , as they are given in our case by the topologies @xmath101 and @xmath102 , can be calculated by using dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "* the _ factorizing topology @xmath103 _ is calculated as a product of one - loop topologies .",

    "they can be reduced in a similar manner as the original planar topologies . in the following section we will deal with these topologies and the necessary modifications of the reduction procedure .      for the rotated reduced planar topologies we assume the same numerator factor as for the non - reduced one , @xmath107 .",
    "the procedure is quite the same as in the case discussed before .",
    "but because one of the denominator factors @xmath108 and @xmath109 is absent , it is not possible to cancel the factors of @xmath43 as in the previous case .",
    "instead , we anticipate the linearization as in the case of @xmath38 ( and with the same sign ) in writing @xmath110 again , while the additional factors @xmath111 will be cancelled together with @xmath112 in the last step , the subsequent linearization will replace @xmath113 by @xmath114 .",
    "however , this last step makes the difference between the two topologies .    for",
    "the topology @xmath105 the denominator factor @xmath108 is absent .",
    "however , we can obtain @xmath115 at this point the different signs for the linearization enter the game . while we have designed the term @xmath113 in the way that it can be combined with the factors from the cancellation of @xmath43 , in order to obtain @xmath95 we have to divide by @xmath116",
    "however , if the second produced particle is massless , @xmath117 , this factor will become zero . in order to include also the massless case , we will prefer the linearization @xmath118 for this topology , i.e.  the upper sign .",
    "the whole reduction procedure for the case of the topology @xmath105 reads @xmath119 all the diagrams on the right hand side except for the first one with maximal powers @xmath98 for @xmath28 and @xmath120 for @xmath121 are again members of the different simpler topology classes which were mentioned in the previous paragraph .    looking at the topology @xmath106 , the propagator factor @xmath109 is absent . in this case",
    "we can obtain a reduction formula from combining @xmath108 and @xmath122 to obtain @xmath123 in this case the linearization @xmath124 ( lower sign ) is more appropriate .",
    "the result of the reduction reads @xmath125",
    "after having reduced the numerator of the integrand to factors @xmath126 in case of the planar two - loop topology and @xmath127 in case of the rotated reduced planar two - loop topologies , we can start to integrate this set of master integrals @xmath128 .",
    "before we do so , we have to consider the occurrence of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences and their treatment in terms of appropriate subtractions . as for the treatment of infrared ( ir ) divergences",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for the scalar case . in the more general case ,",
    "methods taken from ref .",
    "@xcite can be applied .",
    "however , in this paper we consider only ir - finite examples .",
    "the uv - divergences can be subdivided into three classes : divergences with respect to the two loop momenta and global divergences .",
    "it is quite obvious that if we have @xmath129 propagator factors depending only on @xmath11 , @xmath130 propagator factors depending only @xmath22 , @xmath131 propagator factors depending both on @xmath11 and @xmath22 , and a power @xmath132 in the numerator , the corresponding degrees of divergence in @xmath133 space - time dimensions are given by @xmath134 the two - loop integral is divergent in @xmath133 dimensions , if at least one of the degrees @xmath135 , @xmath136 , or @xmath137 is zero or negative .",
    "if the degree of divergence is zero , this divergence is called logarithmic divergence .    in order to calculate the integral",
    ", we first have to regularize it .",
    "we use dimensional regularization and write @xmath138 .",
    "after that , integrals can be split off into a divergent and a convergent part .",
    "while the convergent part can be calculated for @xmath139 , i.e.  for @xmath140 space - time dimensions , the integrand of the divergent part is simpler but has the same uv - behaviour . in an appropriate subtraction procedure , therefore , we subtract and add an integrand which is simple enough to be integrated analytically ( at least the singular part ) but has the same singularities as the integrand itself in order to cancel the singularities .",
    "this subtraction procedure is found and will be formulated multiplicatively  @xcite .",
    "the subtracted integrand contains the subtraction factors @xmath141 with @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 are _ subtraction masses _ which have to be introduced artificially .",
    "the degrees of divergence for this subtracted integrand increase by @xmath147 and @xmath148 , resp .  and thus may lead to integrals without singularities for arbitrary values for @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 .",
    "finally , the limit @xmath153 can be performed , leaving the subtracted integral convergent and enabling the semi - analytical calculation .",
    "since the subtraction terms always contain a two - point subloop , the singular part can be calculated analytically . for",
    "the non - singular part one can use @xmath139  @xcite . in the end",
    "the sum of subtracted integral and subtraction terms have to be independent of the subtraction masses . in the following",
    "we will deal with the subtracted integrals only .",
