    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is known to be able to destabilize hydrodynamically stable flows by means of an externally imposed magnetic field as originally shown by velikhov @xcite and analyzed in more detail by chandrasekhar @xcite for cylindrical taylor - couette flow of a perfectly conducting fluid subject to an axial magnetic field .",
    "three decades later balbus and hawley @xcite suggested that , in a similar way , the hydrodynamically stable keplerian velocity distribution in accretion disks could be rendered turbulent by the mri accounting for the formation of stars and entire galaxies proceeding much faster than it could be accomplished by the viscous angular - momentum transport alone .",
    "meanwhile this proposition has triggered not only numerous theoretical and numerical studies @xcite but also some experimental efforts as well @xcite .",
    "however , one of the main technical challenges to laboratory mri is the magnetic reynolds number @xmath1 which is required to be @xmath2 at least . for a liquid metal with the magnetic prandtl number @xmath3",
    "this translates into a hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "thus , the base flow on which the mri is supposed to be observable may easily be turbulent at such reynolds numbers independently of mri as in the experiment of sisan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . a way to circumvent this problem",
    "was proposed by hollerbach and rdiger @xcite who suggested that mri can take place in the taylor - couette flow at @xmath5 when the imposed magnetic field is helical rather than purely axial as in the classical case .",
    "the theoretical prediction of this new type of helical mri ( hmri ) was soon succeeded by a confirming experimental evidence provided by the so - called promise facility @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these experimental observations have subsequently been questioned by liu _",
    "@xcite who find no such instability in their inviscid theoretical analysis of finite length cylinders with insulating end caps .",
    "they suspect the observed phenomenon to be a transient growth rather than a self - sustained instability @xcite .    indeed , such an interpretation of the hmri is possible when the analysis is based only on the conventional linear stability analysis for separate fourier modes as done by hollerbach and rdiger @xcite following the classical mri approach",
    ". however , there is a principal difference between the classical and the helical mris , namely , the former is stationary whereas the latter is traveling .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the conventional stability analysis for traveling waves yields the so - called convective instability threshold at which the system becomes able to amplify certain externally excited perturbations . at this threshold",
    "the perturbation grows in time only in the frame of reference moving with its group velocity while it asymptotically decays in any other frame of reference including the laboratory one @xcite .",
    "eventually , such a growing while traveling perturbation reaches the end wall where it is absorbed unless the system is able to reflect it back .",
    "the latter supposes reflection symmetry in the system which , however , is not the case provided that the magnetic field is helical .",
    "thus , it is indeed unclear whether the hmri can be self - sustained in an ideal taylor - couette flow of large but finite axial extension .",
    "this question is addressed in the second part of the present study where the absolute hmri is found to exist besides the convective one which , in turn , is analyzed in detail in the first part . note that the existence of absolute instability is nontrivial as known , for instance , for the ponomarenko dynamo @xcite which has a convective but no absolute instability threshold @xcite .",
    "the latter requires an additional return flow to be included in the original ponomarenko model @xcite .",
    "the distinction between convective and absolute instabilities is relevant mainly for open flows and unbounded geometries @xcite . in finite geometries , it is important to distinguish transiently growing and noise - sustained perturbations from the self - sustained linear instabilities , which are always global with the threshold asymptotically approaching from above that of the absolute instability as the system size increases @xcite .",
    "we consider both the convective and the absolute hmris in the inductionless approximation corresponding to @xmath6 that was suggested in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this approximation , which leads to a significant simplification of the problem , allows us to focus exclusively on the hmri because it does not capture the conventional mri @xcite .",
    "we show that the hmri is effective only in a relatively narrow range of the ratio of rotation rates of the inner and outer cylinders beyond the limit of purely hydrodynamic instability defined by the so - called rayleigh line .",
    "for the convective hmri , the range of instability is considerably larger for perfectly conducting cylinders than that for insulating ones .",
    "in addition we find that the hmri is effective only in a limited range of reynolds numbers .",
    "namely , for any unstable mode , there is not only a lower critical reynolds number by exceeding which the hmri sets in but also an upper one by exceeding which it disappears again .",
    "it is this upper threshold that distinguishes hmri from a magnetically modified taylor vortex flow .",
    "absolute hmri exists in a significantly narrower range of parameters than the convective one .",
    "in contrast to the convective hmri , the absolute one is much less dependent on the conductivity of the boundaries .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the instability is seen to switch to a long - wave mode with the critical wave numbers and reynolds numbers varying asymptotically as @xmath105 and @xmath134 respectively .      in this section",
    ", we turn to the absolute instability for which the wave number @xmath47 is in general a complex quantity with real and imaginary parts @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that the convective instability threshold considered above is not sufficient for the development of a self - sustained instability unless the system is mirror symmetric along the direction of propagation which , however , is not the case when the magnetic field is helical .",
    "the convective instability just ensures the ability of the system to amplify external perturbations excited with the critical frequency . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the problem is that in an axially bounded system the perturbation has to meet certain boundary conditions at two end walls that , however , can not be accomplished by a single fourier mode .",
    "when the critical fourier mode is replaced with a corresponding wave packet of a limited spatial extension , one finds such a perturbation to grow only in the frame of reference traveling with its group velocity while it decays asymptotically in any other frame of reference including the laboratory one which is at rest .",
    "the growth of a perturbation in the laboratory frame of reference is ensured by the absolute instability threshold , at which the group velocity of the wave packet becomes zero .",
    "thus , formally , the absolute instability requires one more condition to be satisfied , _ i.e. _ , zero group velocity , by means of an additional free parameter  the imaginary part of the wave number .",
    "note that although the group velocity in non - conservative media is , in general , a complex quantity , for the most dangerous perturbations satisfying @xmath137 it is real and , thus , coincides with its common definition .",
    "alternatively , the absolute instability may be regarded as an asymptotic case of the global instability when the axial extension of the system becomes very large @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that for a convectively unstable perturbation to become self - sustained a feedback mechanism is needed which could transfer a part of the growing perturbation as it leaves the system back to its origin .",
    "such a feedback can be provided by the reflections of perturbation from the end walls or , generally , by the end regions where the base state becomes axially non - uniform .",
    "if the base state is both stationary and axially uniform , the coefficients of the linearized perturbation equations do not depend on time and on the axial coordinate , respectively . then ,",
    "as for linear differential equations with constant coefficients , the particular solution for the perturbation varies exponentially in both time and axial coordinate as supposed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert ] ) where both the growth rate @xmath46 and the wave number @xmath47 may be in general complex . at the end walls , where the base state is no longer axially invariant , the particular solutions with different wave numbers become linearly coupled while their time variation remains unaffected as long as the base state is stationary .",
    "thus , the reflection of a perturbation by the end wall in general couples modes with different wave numbers but with the same @xmath138 sufficiently far away from the end walls the reflected perturbation is dominated by the mode with the imaginary part of the wave number @xmath139 corresponding to either the largest growth or lowest decay rate along the axis .",
    "consequently , sufficiently away from the end walls a global mode is expected to consist of two such waves coupled by reflections from the opposite end walls .",
    "taking into account that the amplitude of the reflected wave is proportional to that of the incident wave , it is easy to find that in a sufficiently extended system both waves must have the same imaginary part @xmath139 of the wave number whereas the real parts may be different . additionally , for two such waves to be coupled by reflections from the end walls , they have to propagate in opposite directions .",
    "+     we search for such a pair of modes by considering the conventional neutral stability curves at various @xmath140 as seen in figs .",

    "[ cap : re - wki](c ) .",

    "note that the approach outlined above to find the absolute instability is an extension of the well - known cusp map for the complex frequency plane to the ( @xmath94-@xmath143 ) plane @xcite by using the neutral stability condition @xmath144 which maps the real part of the growth rate @xmath145 to the marginal reynolds number .",

    "the problem was considered in the inductionless approximation defined by a zero magnetic prandtl number ( @xmath0 first , we carried out a conventional linear stability analysis for perturbations in the form of fourier modes specified by real wave numbers . the helical magnetic field was found to extend the original instability to a relatively narrow range beyond its purely hydrodynamic limit defined by the rayleigh line .",
    "the range of destabilization was found to be considerably larger for perfectly conducting cylinders than that for insulating ones . for insulating cylinders , the instability beyond the rayleigh line is effective only in a limited range of wave and reynolds numbers .",
    "unstable reynolds numbers are bounded by an upper critical value which tends to infinity right beyond the rayleigh line .",
    "for perfectly conducting cylinders and moderate helicities of the magnetic field , the range of unstable wave numbers is bounded only from the short - wave end . although there is an upper marginal reynolds number for each unstable wave number , no bounded upper critical reynolds number exists in this case because the range of unstable wave numbers extends to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , infinitely long waves . nevertheless , at sufficiently large helicities , the range of unstable wave numbers becomes bounded also from below , and an upper critical reynolds number appears in the same way as for insulating cylinders .",
    "it is important to note that these instabilities predicted by the conventional stability analysis in the form of single traveling waves correspond to the so - called convective instability threshold at which the system becomes able to amplify certain externally imposed perturbations that , however , are not self - sustained and thus may be experimentally unobservable without a proper external excitation .",
    "the problem is that convectively unstable perturbations grow asymptotically in time only in the frame of reference traveling with their group velocity , whereas they decay in any other frame of reference including the laboratory one . for an instability to be self - sustained and thus observable it has to grow in the laboratory frame of reference . in an extended system , this condition is satisfied by the so - called absolute instability which ensures a zero group velocity of a growing perturbation .",
    "this additional condition is satisfied by regarding the wave number as a complex quantity with a nonzero imaginary part which describes an exponential axial modulation of the wave amplitude . using this concept",
    ", we found that there is not only a convective but also an absolute hmri implying that this instability can be experimentally observable in a system of sufficiently large but finite axial extension . in the hydrodynamically unstable range before the rayleigh line ,",
    "the threshold of absolute instability is slightly higher than the convective one . nevertheless , the critical wavelength for absolute instability is significantly shorter than that for the convective one that may allow us to distinguish between both .",
    "the absolute instability threshold rises significantly above the convective one beyond the rayleigh line . as a result ,",
    "the extension of the absolute instability beyond the rayleigh line is considerably shorter than that of the convective instability without a marked difference between insulating and perfectly conducting cylinders in contrast to the convective hmri .",
    "the extension of hmri beyond the rayleigh line is of particular interest from the astrophysical point of view regarding a keplerian velocity profile @xcite . for a couette - taylor flow with a radius ratio @xmath75 considered here",
    ", the keplerian velocity profile approximately corresponds to a ratio of rotation rates of @xmath149 as seen in figs .",
    "[ cap : muc - bt](b ) and [ cap : muc - ha ] for the absolute instability , no such value of @xmath76 is reached up to @xmath150 and @xmath151 . whether or not it can be reached at higher",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath85 is still an open question requiring a more detailed study using either higher numerical resolution or asymptotic analysis . on the other hand , hmri in a system of large axial extension with a radius ratio of @xmath75",
    "might be of limited astrophysical relevance for accretion disks anyway .",
    "conversely to liu _",
    "@xcite we find that the hmri can be a self - sustained instability rather than just a transient growth .",
    "this contradiction may be due to a couple of additional simplifications underlying the analysis of liu _ et al .",
    "_ first , the viscosity is neglected .",
    "second , the electromagnetic force is treated as a small perturbation which is a sensible approach within the inviscid approximation where an infinitesimal magnetic field can cause a correspondingly slow growth of an unstable fourier mode .",
    "however , such a perturbative approach may be inadequate for the absolute instability which requires a finite temporal growth rate of the corresponding convectively unstable fourier mode .",
    "in addition , note that our results do not support the recent findings of liu @xcite .",
    "according to his estimates for the cases considered here , the absolute hmri occurs above @xmath152 only .",
    "we predict the absolute hmri to occur at the lower value of @xmath153 and to disappear again above @xmath152 due to the mechanism discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : conv - insl ]",
    ". this disagreement may be due to the absolute instability analysis which is carried out by liu using real wave numbers only . according to the conventional absolute instability analysis @xcite",
    ", such an approach yields the long - time asymptotics only in the frame of reference traveling with the group velocity of the fastest growing perturbation .",
    "moreover , owing to its linearity , the analysis is limited to sufficiently small perturbation amplitudes only .",
    "namely , it is limited up to the point where the first exponentially growing perturbation appears , which is the convective instability threshold .        finally , let us compare the convective and absolute instability thresholds calculated for perfectly conducting cylinders with the experimental data of stefani _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite who reports on the observation of hmri - like traveling waves at @xmath154 @xmath1551775 , and a fixed rod current @xmath156 for the coil currents @xmath157 that corresponds to @xmath1583 and @xmath159 - 15.8 .",
    "another observation was done at the same @xmath76 but different other parameters : @xmath160 @xmath161 and @xmath162 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rec - mu - exp ] , in both cases the experimental points lie well inside the range of @xmath76 for convective instability but outside that for absolute instability .",
    "this discrepancy with the experimental observations may be due to the deviation of the real base flow from the idealized one used in this study .",
    "in particular , the ekman pumping driven by the end walls in the experiment , which is not taken into account in the present analysis , may affect the hydrodynamic stability limit of the base flow , _",
    "i.e. _ , its actual rayleigh line , which however serves as the reference point for the observation of mri .",
    "a more detailed comparison with the experimental observations lies outside the scope of the present paper .    in conclusion ,",
    "the main result of the present paper is the finding of absolute hmri in addition to the convective one which can be self - sustained and , thus , experimentally observable without external excitation in a system of sufficiently large axial extension .",
    "a characteristic feature of hmri is the upper critical threshold existing besides the lower one that distinguishes it from a magnetically - modified taylor vortex flow .",
