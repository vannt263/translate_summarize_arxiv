    "despite recent progress , the detailed physical processes in the early stages of low - mass star formation are still uncertain . currently , the most detailed and successful model of low - mass star formation is the four - stage model proposed in the late 80 s by @xcite . in the first stage , slowly rotating molecular cloud cores form within a molecular cloud as magnetic and turbulent support is lost through ambipolar diffusion . in the second stage ,",
    "a molecular cloud core becomes dynamically unstable and collapses from the inside - out , forming a protostar surrounded by an accretion disk deeply embedded within an infalling envelope of dust and gas . in the third stage , as the protostar continues accreting mass through the accretion disk , a stellar wind breaks out along the rotational axis of the system , creating a bipolar outflow . in the fourth stage ,",

    ", we investigate the protostellar collapse and outflow in the second and third stages , with the submillimeter array ( sma ) observations around a young protostar , iras 05413 - 0104 , and its remarkable jet hh 212 .",
    "iras 05413 - 0104 is a cold , low - luminosity ( @xmath2 14 @xmath5 ) , low - mass source @xcite , located at a distance of 460 pc in the l1630 cloud of orion .",
    "it is surrounded by a cold ( @xmath2 14 k ) , flattened ( with an aspect ratio of 2:1 ) rotating 3 envelope with a diameter of 12,000 au @xcite .",
    "it is detected also at 1.1 mm @xcite and 1.3 mm @xcite , with a high ratio of millimeter - wave luminosity to bolometric luminosity .",
    "it is thus classified as a class 0 source , which has much material to be accreted still from the surrounding molecular gas envelope @xcite .",
    "hh 212 is a remarkable jet with a length of @xmath2 240 arcsecs ( @xmath2 0.6 pc ) powered by the iras source .",
    "it was discovered in the rotational - vibrational @xmath6 s(1 ) emission line of 2 at @xmath7 @xcite .",

    "a temporal variation in the jet velocity produces a chain of 2 knots propagating down along the jet axis .",
    "since these 2 knots are localized ( ballistic ) shocks with high thermal pressure , they expands sideways , growing into 2 bow shocks with the shock velocity ( and thus temperature ) decreasing rapidly away from the bow tips .",
    "as these bow shocks propagate down along the jet axis , they sweep up the ambient material into a thin outflow shell around the jet axis . in our observations ,",
    "the shells around the source can be identified as the ambient material swept up by the 2 bow shocks .",
    "in addition , emission also arises from around the 2 knots and bow shocks , with the velocity decreasing rapidly away from the knots and bow tips .",
    "higher @xmath46 transition line of traces higher velocity around the knots and bow tips likely because it arises from regions of higher temperature and thus higher velocity closer to the knots and bow tips . as a result",
    ", the emission appears jetlike at high velocities in high @xmath46 transition .",
    "located inside the outflow cavity , the jetlike emission is unlikely from the entrained ambient gas .",
    "the jet is probably intrinsically molecular , such as that seen in hh 211 @xcite .",
    "since the shell is the swept - up ambient material , the density of the ambient material is expected to be lower than that of the shell .",
    "thus , the jet is an overdensed jet with the density higher than that of the ambient material .    in the south , emission is seen coincident with the 2 bow shock sb4 , indicating that the shocked material there must have cooled very fast from @xmath2 2000 k ( 2 ) to a few 10 k ( ) because of a significant mixing with the ambient material .",
    "the transverse velocity there is also lower than that around other bow shocks ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pv12co ] ) , probably because the bow shock sb4 is sharing momentum with the quiescent ambient material ( cf .",
    "fig . 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the bow shock sb4 may trace the leading bow shock where the head of the jet impacts on the ambient material .",
    "so emission is seen around the source and the 2 knotty shocks in the south , especially the knot sk4 .",
    "the emission around the source may arise from two components . like",
    "that around the knot sk4 , the emission seen at high velocity is likely to be from knotty shocks , which are expected to be there following the 2 knotty shocks toward the source .",
    "the shocks are not seen in 2 probably due to dust extinction .",
    "however , the so emission seen around the systemic velocity may arise from the flattened envelope due to its low velocity .",
    "observations at high angular resolution are needed to confirm this .",
    "so emission has also been seen toward the cepa - east outflows , tracing ambient material at 60 - 100 k and shocked gas at 70 - 180 k @xcite .",
    "assuming an optically thin emission , a temperature of 120 k , and a so abundance of 10@xmath94 relative to molecular hydrogen @xcite , the mass is found to be @xmath2 0.4 and 0.1 , respectively , around the source and the knot sk4 . however , these masses are too large to be from knotty shocks .",
    "the abundance of so must have been highly enhanced .",
    "note that emission is weak around the knot sk4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:12co]b ) , probably suggesting that there is destroyed by the shock interaction .",
    "the detection of the so emission is likely because of the abundance enhancement of so due to the shock - triggered release of various molecules ( e.g. , h@xmath8s / ocs / s ) from dust mantles and the subsequent chemical reactions in the warm gas . since the abundance is enhanced only for a very short period of time , the so emission traces regions of recent shock activity @xcite .    around the knot sk4",
    ", the redshifted emission is seen to the east while the blueshifted emission is seen to the west , similar to that seen in the flattened envelope .",
    "a similar velocity structure has been seen around the knot sk1 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : so ] for its location ) in 2 and considered as a tentative evidence that the knot sk1 is rotating @xcite .",
    "it was observed with 3 slits from east to west with a separation of @xmath2 . the peak velocities with respect to the systemic velocity",
    "were found to be + 4.6 , + 2.9 , and + 2.3 , measured from east to west .",
    "thus , assuming that the central velocity at the knot sk1 is @xmath95 , the redshifted emission is seen to the east while the blueshifted is seen to the west .",
    "a similar velocity structure is seen here around the knot sk4 in so but with higher velocity .",
    "does this suggest that the knot sk4 is also rotating and that the jet carries away angular momentum from the infalling envelope ?",
    "the velocity here , however , is much larger than @xmath71 ( i.e. , 0.3 ) and thus may be too large to be from rotation .",
    "in addition , the shocked material there is expected to have sideways expansion .",
    "further observations at higher angular resolution are needed to study it .",
    "we have mapped the 1.33 mm continuum , ( @xmath0 ) , ( @xmath0 ) , ( @xmath0 ) , and so ( @xmath1 ) emission around a protostellar jet hh 212 and its central source , iras 05413 - 0104 .",
    "a dust core is seen in the continuum around the source , with a temperature of @xmath2 46 k and a mass of @xmath2 0.08 .",
    "a flattened envelope is seen in around the source in the equator perpendicular to the jet axis , with its inner part seen in .",
    "the structure and kinematics of the envelope can be roughly reproduced by a simple edge - on disk model with both infall and rotation .",
    "the flattened envelope seems dynamically infalling toward the source with slow rotation because the kinematics is found to be roughly consistent with a free fall toward the source plus a rotation of a constant specific angular momentum .",
    "a outflow is seen surrounding the 2 jet , with a narrow waist around the source .",
    "jetlike structures are also seen in near the source aligned with the 2 jet at high velocities . the morphological relationship between the 2 jet and the outflow , and the kinematics of the outflow along the jet axis",
    "are both consistent with those seen in a jet - driven bow shock model .",
    "so emission is seen around the source and the 2 knotty shocks in the south , tracing shocked emission around them .",
