    "equation ( [ register ] ) gives a good approximation to the wave function in the limit @xmath16 .    in the lattice space of the digital quantum simulation ,",
    "an important task is to construct the kinetic and potential operators . because the potential operator @xmath17 is a function of the coordinate operator @xmath2 , it is a diagonal matrix in the coordinate representation , which can be decomposed as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the pauli matrix @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the identity matrix in two dimensions .",
    "the kinetic energy operator , which is diagonal in the momentum representation , can be constructed in the coordinate representation with the help of a quantum fourier transformation ( qft ) .",
    "similar to equation ( [ register ] ) , we have @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the wave function in the momentum representation , and    @xmath24    is the eigenvalue of the momentum operator @xmath25 in the momentum representation , @xmath26 therefore the kinetic energy operator in the coordinate representation can be written via the qft as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the qft operator .",
    "equations ( [ register ] ) , ( [ potential ] ) and ( [ fourier ] ) give the discretized forms of the wave function , the potential operator and the kinetic energy operator , respectively . with these expressions in hand , we can efficiently implement the time evolution of the system within a small interval @xmath29 , by using a modified trotter formula , which is correct up to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ def-1 ] ) is then approximated as @xmath30 from equation ( [ fourier ] ) we have @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the usual bit - swapped fourier transformation operator , which can be readily realized in quantum circuits via a series of hadamard gates and controlled - phase gates @xcite .",

    "we simulated the situation in which the particle is initially trapped inside one of the two wells by preparing the pseudo - pure state @xmath39 from thermal equilibrium @xcite as the initial state .",
    "the tunneling process of the particle was simulated using nine experiments , where in each experiment the operations in fig . 1 were performed .",
    "quantum state tomography ( qst ) was performed on the density matrices of the final states after 1 to 9 steps ( @xcite ) .",
    "the whole evolution process of a single particle in the double - well potential can be described by depicting the diagonal elements of the density matrix , which correspond to the probability distribution of the particle , at each step .",
    "they are illustrated in fig .",
    "it is clearly observed that the particle tunnels through the potential barrier between the two wells while its probability to be found in the barrier remains scarce , which accords well with theoretical calculations in fig .",

    "our two - qubit experiments reflected a remarkable difference between the two situations with and without the double - well potential . in our three - qubit experiments ,",
