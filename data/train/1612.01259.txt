    "the light - front hamiltonian approach is poised as a unique tool to understand the non - perturbative dynamics of quantum field theory in minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian formalism provides frame - independent wave functions that are essential for understanding the underlying structure of relativistic bound state systems . the obtained light - front wave functions ( lfwfs )",
    "can be used to compute hadronic observables and distributions defined in the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) , and to study exclusive processes in the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , which are otherwise not easily accessible in other methods @xcite .",
    "therefore , the light - front hamiltonian approach is complementary to lagrangian methods formulated in euclidean space , e.g. , lattice gauge theory .",
    "recently we proposed a phenomenological light - front potential model for mesons based on light - front holography @xcite .",
    "we applied this model to charmonium and bottomonium , and solved the system in a basis function representation .",
    "the obtained mass spectra , form factors and decay constants are compared with experiments and other established methods . the lfwfs are also used to study exclusive vector meson productions in dis @xcite . very recently ,",
    "similar work has been done within the dyson - schwinger / bethe - salpeter approach @xcite and the covariant spectator theory ( cst ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an improvement of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite by incorporating the evolution of the coupling based on perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "we will show that the mass spectra are improved .",
    "another aim of this paper is to display the lfwfs , which reveal first - hand information of the hadrons , and also help to visualize relativistic bound states on the light front .",
    "heavy quarkonium is an ideal system to explore lfwfs , as the characteristic heavy quark velocities are small [ @xmath0 compared to the speed of light and the familiar nonrelativistic quantum mechanical language and intuition may be applied .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the model reads @xcite , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the average 4-momentum squared carried by the exchanged gluon .",
    "the confining term @xmath3 comes from the `` soft - wall '' light - front holography , @xmath4 is the strength of the confinement , and @xmath5 is brodsky and de tramond s holographic variable @xcite . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are taken as the independent variables , @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is the color factor .",
    "@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the mass of the quark ( anti - quark ) .",
    "the longitudinal confinement comes from completing the transverse holographic confinement in the finite mass case and is consistent with the pqcd asymptotics of the distribution amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "the longitudinal confining strength is fixed in the nonrelativistic limit hence no additional parameter is introduced .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strong coupling @xmath13 is assumed fixed for each system , say , charmonium , whereas for different systems , the values of @xmath13 are different and are related through the pqcd evolution . while such treatment is reasonable ( indeed traditional ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite ) , as the mass difference between states in the same system , e.g. @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is small compared to their respective masses , nevertheless , the inclusion of the running coupling implements important qcd physics .",
    "another motivation is to improve the rotational symmetry and the hyperfine structure . in the effective one - gluon exchange kernel , @xcite",
    ", a non - covariant uv counterterm is introduced to regularize the uv divergence appearing in the box diagram @xcite , which further spoils the rotational symmetry as will be seen in the mass spectra below .",
    "the introduction of the running coupling changes the uv asymptotics of the one - gluon exchange kernel  . as a result , the counterterm is not necessary anymore .",
    "while rotational symmetry is not fully restored , as we will see , the breaking of rotational symmetry is moderated , and the hyperfine structure is significantly improved .    in the effective one - gluon exchange interaction eq .",
    "( [ eqn : heff ] ) , the 4-momentum squared of the exchanged gluon @xmath16 naturally appears .",
    "the running coupling can be introduced as a function of @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 for charmonium and @xmath19 for bottomonium . here",
    "@xmath20 is an ir cutoff introduced to avoid the pqcd ir catastrophe .",
    "similar forms are used in the literature , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in practice",
    ", we choose @xmath21 .",
    "we find the spectrum is not sensitive for the choice of @xmath22 within the range @xmath23 .",
    "the state vectors , hence the lfwfs , are obtained from diagonalizing the light cone hamiltonian operator @xmath24 : @xmath25 the state vectors can be represented in the fock space : @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the intrinsic spin and the spin projection of the particle .",
    "the coefficient of the expansion , @xmath29 , is the ( two - body ) lfwf , which is normalized as , @xmath30 it is useful to introduce lfwfs in the transverse coordinate space : @xmath31    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eqn : heff ] ) was solved in a basis function approach .",
    "the lfwfs then are represented as , @xmath32 here the coefficients @xmath33 are obtained from diagonalization .",
    "basis function @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the solutions of the hamiltonian without the one - gluon exchange interaction , i.e. , the kinetic energy plus the confinement terms . specifically , @xmath36 is the harmonic oscillator function in the holographic variables .",
    "@xmath37 is the jacobi polynomials weighed by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 .    in practical calculations",
    ", the basis is truncated and lfwfs have a corresponding finite set of terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : basis_representation ] ) .",
    "observables are evaluated from finite - dimensional representations and , in principle , have to be extrapolated to the complete basis . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the basis are truncated according to : @xmath41",
    ".summary of the model parameters .",

    "the light - front hamiltonian formalism provides a natural framework to understand strongly interacting relativistic bound states .",
    "we demonstrate this in a model that implements a holographic confinement and a one - gluon exchange interaction in the heavy quarkonium systems .",
    "we update the previous results by incorporating the evolution of the strong interaction coupling constant .",
    "the resulting spectroscopy is compared favorably with the experiments .",
    "we present the wave functions , which bridge the nonrelativistic picture and the quantum field theoretical treatment of heavy quarkonium .",
    "they offer a unique way to visualize and to understand the structure of the relativistic bound states .",
    "our model can be applied to other mesons , e.g. , heavy - light and light mesons , which is in progress .",
    "another important improvement is to include the self - energy correction @xcite , which will allow us to go beyond the light - front potential model treatment and to build a consistent effective light - front model for hadrons .",
    "there are several promising ways under development to go beyond the current phenomenological model .",
    "the first one is the systematic fock sector expansion with a non - perturbative sector dependent renormalization @xcite .",
    "the second one is the full configuration interaction simulation , with or without the coupled cluster technique , of the light - front qcd hamiltonian within the basis function approach @xcite .",
    "the third line of investigation is to use the effective hamiltonians obtained from a similarity renormalization group with a systematic perturbative expansion @xcite .",
    "last but not least , progress in the holographic approach to qcd may also provide new insights .",
    "the current model can be linked to all these lines of investigation .",
    "the physics learned from the current model , and the techniques employed in our model , may be helpful to explore those more ambitious approaches .",
