    "the direct project ( as in `` direct distances '' ) started in 1996 with the long - term goal of obtaining distances to two important galaxies in the cosmological distance ladder  m31 and m33  using detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) and cepheids .",
    "these two nearby galaxies are the stepping stones in most of the current effort to understand the evolving universe at large scales . not only are they essential to the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale , but they also constrain population synthesis models for early galaxy formation and evolution . however , accurate distances are essential to make these calibrations free from large systematic uncertainties .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries have the potential to establish distances to m31 and m33 with an unprecedented accuracy of better than 5% and possibly to better than 1% .",
    "current uncertainties in the distances to these galaxies are in the order of 10 to 15% , as there are discrepancies of 0.2 - 0.3 mag between various distance indicators .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries ( paczyski 1997 ) offer a single - step distance determination to nearby galaxies ( fitzpatrick et al .",
    "2003 ) and may therefore provide an accurate zeropoint calibration for other distance indicators , including cepheids .",
    "the direct project obtained time - series observations of m31 and m33 during 170 nights between 1996 september 6 and 2000 january 2 using the fred l. whipple observatory 1.2-m telescope .",
    "additional observations were carried out during 36 nights in 1996 and 1997 at the michigan - dartmouth - mit observatory 1.3-m telescope . in 1996 and 1997",
    ", images were obtained using a camera with @xmath0 field of view . in 1998 and 1999 ,",
    "data were collected using a camera with a @xmath1 field of view.observations were obtained mainly in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands , with some additional data in the @xmath4 band .",
    "the total area covered by the observations was @xmath5 in m31 and @xmath6 in m33 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "most of the fields have been analyzed and published ( bonanos et al .",
    "2003 ; kaluzny et al .",
    "1998 ; kaluzny et al .",
    "1999 ; macri et al .",

    "1999 ; stanek et al . 1998 ; stanek et al .",
    "these publications contain a total of @xmath7 eclipsing binaries , @xmath8 cepheid variables , and @xmath9 miscellaneous variables .",
    "representative light curves of cepheid variables and eclipsing binaries discovered in m33 can be seen in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "two additional publications will appear in the near future with the analysis of the remaining fields ( bonanos et al .",
    "2004 ; macri et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "additional publications related to the direct project include : the discovery of cessation of pulsations in a long - period cepheid in m33 ( macri , sasselov , & stanek 2001 ) ; the study of the influence of unresolved blends on the cepheid distance scale ( mochejska et al .",
    "2000 ; mochejska et al .",
    "2001a ) ; a catalog of globular clusters in m31 and m33 ( mochejska et al . 1998 ) ; ancillary stellar catalogs and additional short - period variables ( macri et al . 2001b ; mochejska et al . 2001b",
    "; mochejska et al . 2001c ; mochejska et al .",
    "four promising detached eclipsing binary systems have been discovered in the direct fields ; two in m31 and two in m33 . as a first step in their follow - up",
    ", higher quality light curves were obtained through observations conducted at the kitt peak national observatory 2.1-m telescope in 1999 and 2001 .",
    "ecently , a program was started to measure radial velocities of the debs using the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ) at keck observatory .",
    "figure 4 shows the radial velocities measured for a system in m33 during the first two nights of that program , plotted against the radial velocity predicted by the photometric data .",
    "m33 has one of the largest abundance gradients among nearby spiral galaxies , @xmath10  dex / kpc ( henry & howard 1995 ; monteverde , herrero , & lennon 2000 ) .",
    "the direct cepheid sample in this galaxy exceeds 700 variables and covers the majority of the disk , making it ideal for a study of the metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity relation . a previous observational determination ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1998 ) based on a similar differential test , but using cepheids in m101 , obtained a value for the dependence in the @xmath11 bands that is at odds with theoretical predictions ( bono et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , a recent analysis by fiorentino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) has postulated a possible solution for the disagreement .",
    "follow - up observations of m33 cepheids were started in 2002 august using the minimosaic ccd imager at the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "once these observations conclude in 2004 january , we expect to have obtained @xmath12  epochs in @xmath13 with a greatly improved image quality relative to the original direct survey ( @xmath14 vs. @xmath15 ) , which in turn will result in greatly improved photometric accuracy",
    ". we should be able to detect the metallicity effect predicted by fiorentino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in the @xmath13 bands at the @xmath16 level .",
    "additionally , we are carrying out near - infrared ( @xmath17 ) observations , using the near infrared imager ( niri ) on the 8.1-m fred gillett gemini north telescope , of a subsample of @xmath18 cepheids well distributed across the disk of m33 .",
    "figure 5 shows preliminary @xmath19 and @xmath20 p - l relations for a subset of 95 variables located in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "once all data are collected , we should be able to detect the metallicity effect predicted by fiorentino et al .",
