    "we study this question for an @xmath4 model in six dimensions ( 6d ) @xcite which , compared to models derived from the heterotic string @xcite , has considerably simpler field content .",
    "the paper extends previous work which demonstrated that the compact dimensions can be stabilized at small radii , @xmath5 , much smaller than the inverse supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "a crucial ingredient for the stabilization of compact dimensions is the casimir energy of bulk fields @xcite .",
