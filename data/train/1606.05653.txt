    "as we have shown , there is a non - vanishing 4d fi term @xmath114 , which follows from the green - schwarz term .",
    "following @xcite , it would be interesting to analyze systematically the interplay between the classical bulk flux and the local quantum flux at the fixed points , and to study their joint effect on the zero - mode wave functions .",
    "the explicit form of the supersymmetric effective action enables us to determine the masses of the bosons in the theory . for the gauge boson @xmath18 and the charged scalar field",
    "@xmath37 the results were already given in @xcite .",

    "this modifies the classical scalar mass term to @xmath116 without flux the negative second term , accounting for the quantum corrections induced by anomaly cancellation , leads to a vacuum expectation value for @xmath37 such that the total @xmath1-term vanishes . for non - vanishing flux , however , @xmath117 and the first term tends to stabilize the scalar field @xmath37 at zero .",
    "consequently , the charged scalars are stabilized at the origin as long as the first , flux induced , term in eq .   dominates , i.e.  for @xmath118 moreover , the real part of the gauge kinetic function , determining the effective @xmath4 gauge coupling , has to be positive for the theory to be consistent . because of the negative prefactor of @xmath60 this leads to a restriction of the physical moduli space parametrized by @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( see eq .  ) , @xmath119 hence , for @xmath120 the charged fields are always stabilized at zero for @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the physical region of the moduli space appears , since @xmath121 . in the following we set @xmath122 . ] .",
    "furthermore , in this regime the @xmath1-term contribution to the scalar potential is positive .",
    "however , it is obvious that the runaway - type @xmath1-term potential alone can not stabilize the moduli fields and we have to include a superpotential .    a superpotential for the moduli can arise at the orbifold fixed points in the six - dimensional supergravity theory .",
    "the superpotential in the 4d effective action is the sum of the fixed point contributions .",
    "consistency requires this superpotential to be gauge invariant . in the following discussion we neglect a possible coupling of moduli to charged bulk fields and restrict our attention to a superpotential that only depends on the moduli fields .",
    "for that reason we define a gauge invariant combination of the two shifting chiral superfields @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath123 the superpotential is a holomorphic function of @xmath124 and the gauge invariant modulus @xmath125 . inspired by typical superpotentials induced by nonperturbative effects , such as gaugino condensation or instanton corrections ,",

    "the @xmath2-term scalar potential reads @xmath132 note that the khler potential is of the no - scale form , and the contribution @xmath133 is therefore canceled .",
    "the f - term potential also contributes to the scalar mass term @xmath134 .",
    "however , this contribution is @xmath135 , which is much smaller than the leading contribution @xmath136 , and it can therefore be neglected .    with the charged fields stabilized at zero the @xmath1-term @xmath137 and the linearly independent combination @xmath138 can be used to rewrite the scalar potential in the convenient form @xmath139 where the parameters of the superpotential are encoded in @xmath140 for the specific form of the superpotential these quantities are given in app .

    "the form is identical to the two moduli case discussed in @xcite , @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the ratio @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , the arguments for the existence of vacua given in @xcite carry over to the three moduli case .",
    "importantly , one necessary condition is that the prefactor @xmath146 of one of the moduli in the gauge kinetic function is negative . in the above case",
    "this constrains the allowed moduli region to a regime where the @xmath1-terms are positive definite .",
    "the additional negative contributions from the @xmath2-terms of the gauge invariant superpotential allow to find minkowski or de sitter vacua with all moduli stabilized . in this way we can construct models with minkowski or de sitter vacua with a size of the internal space that ranges between gut and tev scale .    given a vacuum with @xmath147 and the cancellation between @xmath2- and @xmath1-term contributions to the potential",

    "therefore , the mass scale of the internal dimensions ( in 4d planck units ) is given by @xmath158 which corresponds to the gut scale and an intermediate mass scale , respectively .",
    "the moduli are stabilized at @xmath159 , @xmath160 . as discussed above",
    ", the combination @xmath161 remains constant in both models .",
    "the minima in the two different models are plotted in the @xmath59-@xmath60 and the @xmath59-@xmath162 plane in figures [ minimumploti ] and [ minimumplotii ] .",
    "one immediate consistency check for the solutions is the value of the effective gauge coupling which has to be positive and small enough to allow a perturbative treatment @xmath163 this perfectly matches the scaling behavior in eq .  .",
    "the charged scalar and vector boson masses can then be evaluated numerically using eqs .   and",

    "the scaling between the two models matches the one predicted in eq .  .",
    "the same is true for the two non - vanishing eigenvalues of the axion mass matrix @xmath171 so that @xmath172 one massless axion gives mass to the vector boson via the stckelberg mechanism .",
    "their numerical values in both vacua are discussed in app .",
    "[ appnumerical ] , where the scaling is explicitly demonstrated .",
    "it is instructive to compare the mass spectra of the two models . from eq .",
    "one reads off that in both cases @xmath173 .",
    "hence , even the lightest charged scalar does not belong to the low - energy effective lagrangian for fields with masses @xmath174 .",
    "nevertheless , we included this scalar in the above discussion to check the stability of the vacuum , that is @xmath175 .",
    "the vector boson , moduli and axion masses scale as @xmath176 and become parametrically smaller than the size of the extra dimension for large @xmath25 .",
    "the first step in calculating the fermion masses is to disentangle their mixing with the gravitino , i.e.  to identify the goldstino .",

    "whereas the mass term for the gravitino remains unchanged .",
    ".   represents the gravitino lagrangian in unitary gauge .",
    "hence , the dependence on the goldstino should completely disappear in the full lagrangian , which we explicitly demonstrate in the following .",

    "finally , we discussed two example models with different parameters and evaluated numerically the masses of all particles in the model . in the first example , the extra dimensions are of order the gut scale , @xmath214 , and moduli , axion and gauge boson masses are also @xmath215 , slightly larger than gravitino and modulini masses . in the second example , the size of the extra dimensions corresponds to an intermediate scale , @xmath216 and all masses scale as @xmath217 .",
    "the only exception is the charged scalar mass which is of the order of the compactification scale .",
    "the size of the extra dimensions is controlled by the gauge coupling , with @xmath218 .",
    "this dependence on the gauge coupling can be used to construct models whose size of the extra dimensions interpolates between the gut scale and the tev scale .",
    "the constructed family of de sitter vacua can easily be combined with higher - dimensional gut models , and they also offer an interesting playground to study the interplay of moduli stabilization and inflation . since the considered 6d flux compactifications contain all ingredients familiar from string models , i.e. compact dimensions with flux , the green - schwarz mechanism and a nonperturbative superpotential , it will be very interesting to see whether they can in fact be realized within a string theory construction .",
    "we thank emilian dudas , zygmunt lalak , jan louis , hans - peter nilles , and alexander westphal for valuable discussions . this work was supported by the german science foundation ( dfg ) within the collaborative research center ( sfb ) 676 `` particles , strings and the early universe '' . m.d .",
    "also acknowledges support from the studienstiftung des deutschen volkes .",
    "for the evaluation of the superpotential parameters it is convenient to define new linear combinations of the derivative operators @xmath219 in terms of this derivative operators the constraints can be rewritten as ( note that @xmath220 ) @xmath221 using the specific form of the nonperturbative superpotential the parameters can be identified as :    @xmath222    under the assumption @xmath223 and @xmath224 the imaginary parts are generically stabilized at zero .",
    "nevertheless , this has to be checked a posteriori for the specific superpotential parameters .",
    "in the following we will therefore set @xmath225 and @xmath226 and crosscheck for consistency afterward .",
    "we further introduce a convenient new combination @xmath227 using the relations @xmath228 and analogous equations for @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is substituted by @xmath1 , as well as @xmath231 one finds    @xmath232    here , we have introduced the linear combination @xmath233 .",
    "one can then reverse the problem of finding a minimum of the scalar potential for fixed parameters by fixing the values of the moduli and trying to solve eqs .   for the superpotential parameters instead .",
    "it is obvious that the superpotential has five free parameters , but we only have four equations to determine them .",
    "therefore , generically we have to fix one of the parameters in order to solve for the others which corresponds to nonperturbative effects in @xmath125 . ] .",
    "the solution for the superpotential parameters has to fulfill several consistency conditions .",
    "for instance , taking into account eqs .   and , @xmath18 and @xmath234 have to be positive .",
    "interestingly , the combination of the equations @xmath235 with the constraint that @xmath236 , fixes @xmath18 unambiguously @xmath237 where we have introduced the new variable @xmath238 . unfortunately , the rest of the equations can not be simplified in a similar way and have to be evaluated numerically .",
    "in the following we derive the mass matrix for canonically normalized fermions and show explicitly that the goldstino decouples in the unitary gauge .",
    "the standard fermion mass terms for gaugino and modulini are given in full generality in @xcite .",
    "for our case they read @xmath239 where @xmath240 ( with @xmath241 etc . ) .",
    "after the rescaling to canonical kinetic terms and transforming to the unitary gauge , the fermion bilinears are given by @xmath242 using @xmath243 @xcite , the mass matrix elements read @xmath244 in order to show the decoupling of the goldstino we now perform the unitary transformation to the @xmath245 basis , for which we have to show @xmath246 . using the above expressions for @xmath247 and eq .   for @xmath248 one obtains @xmath249 where we used @xmath250 .",
    "clearly , the gauge invariance of the superpotential , i.e @xmath251 , implies that in minkowski space @xmath252 similarly , one finds for the second condition @xmath253 where we have used the identity @xmath254 from eq .",
    "one reads off that @xmath255 for an extremum of the potential and vanishing vacuum energy density .",
    "as expected , for a gauge invariant superpotential the goldstino completely decouples from the mass matrix at an extremum of the potential with vanishing cosmological constant . in the case of a small cosmological constant @xmath256",
    "the above equations are modified by terms @xmath257 .",
    "we summarize the superpotential parameters and masses of the bosons and fermions in the two vacua with different sizes of the extra dimensions and demonstrate the predicted scaling behavior .",
    "the vacuum expectation values for the moduli in the vacuum are @xmath258 the other input parameters for the two models are @xmath259 corresponding to a scale parameter of @xmath260 . in order to obtain unique solutions for the superpotential we have to fix one of its parameters ,",
