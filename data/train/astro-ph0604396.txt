    "theoretical models of the evolution of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) make predictions about the distributions of their physical parameters such as orbital period , mass ratio and the individual masses of the two stars .",
    "if these parameters can be measured , the ( many ) assumptions that go into the theory can be tested .",
    "these assumptions are of interest in the broader context of binary star evolution .",
    "the same parameters are needed to gain an accurate understanding of the accretion processes which dominate these stars .",
    "unfortunately , the only reliable physical parameter that can be measured for the majority of cvs is their orbital period , with perhaps the spectral type of the donor star coming a distant second . in this ranking ,",
    "the masses of the white dwarf and the donor star are so uncertain that they are often barely mentioned in the context of evolution .",
    "this is partly because of the difficulty of measuring orbital inclinations common to all forms of close binary , but also because it is hard to measure the the radial velocities of the binary components .",
    "the optical spectra of most cvs are dominated by emission from accreting material , rather than the white dwarf . in the case of non - magnetic systems , the emission lines are formed in discs , and often have a double - peaked shape resulting from the doppler shift of matter rotating in a keplerian disc .",
    "the high - velocity wings of the emission lines are expected to form close to the white dwarf , where it is hoped the flow is axi - symmetric .",
    "if so , these wings should trace the motion of the white dwarf .",
    "this is the idea behind many studies of cvs .",
    "however , this method fails in practice : in those systems in which one has independent knowledge of the orbital phase , the emission line radial velocities invariably fail to match expectations ( stover 1981 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the white dwarf velocities measured in this way are still used for mass determination , perhaps because there has not been any direct evidence for the magnitude of the distortion .",
    "this changed after long & gilliland ( 1999 ) measured directly the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the white dwarf in u  gem from narrow photospheric lines visible in the ultraviolet . in this case , the phase agreed perfectly with the predicted conjunction phase .",
    "long & gilliland ( 1999 ) measured @xmath5 .",
    "the direct nature of this measurement makes it the most accurate to date for any cv , and gives us the chance to test what the nature of the distortion of the emission line measurements in one system at least .",
    "one other cv for which we have a good estimate of @xmath6 is ae  aqr ( welsh et al 1995 ) . in this case @xmath6",
    "is measured from the pulsations of the white dwarf .",
    "however , ae  aqr is a very unusual cv with flaring emission lines that are not suited to testing the general method of measuring @xmath6 from line emission .",
    "u  gem is interesting from several other points of view : it is a double - lined , partially - eclipsing system , and is one of the brightest dwarf novae .",
    "it has prominent emission from the gas stream / disc impact region which has a velocity in - between that of a keplerian disc and a ballistic stream ( marsh et al .",
    "finally , during outburst it has shown spiral shocks ( groot 2001 ) .",
    "we will see that our new data has something to tell us on all of these issues .",

    "a similar effect was seen in ex  dra ( billington & marsh 1996 ) who suggested that non - kinematic broadening , such as stark broadening , could be responsible .",

    "this spiral structure has been previously reported for u  gem in outburst ( groot 2001 ) , making it one of a handful of systems in which the phenomenon has been detected .",
    "we emphasize that the amplitude of the spiral structure we find here is _",
    "far _ less than that suggested by neustroev and borisov ( 1998 ) for the same system .",
    "their data shows pronounced asymmetries , but were taken with poor spectral and phase resolution , and most importantly , without complete orbital coverage .",
    "in contrast our raw maps are very symmetric .",
    "we believe their claim of strong spiral structure to be incorrect , and a result of the difficulty of interpreting the complex variations of u  gem with inadequate orbital coverage .    the presence of spiral structure in the disc has been regarded as evidence of `` spiral shocks '' ( steeghs , harlaftis & horne 1998 ) , which had been predicted in simulations of accretion discs ( see matsuda et al .",
    "2000 for a review ) .",
    "the spiral shock interpretation requires the presence of large or unusually hot discs .",
    "this prompted smak ( 2001 ) and ogilvie ( 2002 ) to propose alternatives to the spiral shocks to explain the phenomenon .",
    "they suggest that the spiral features revealed by doppler tomography could be explained as the consequence of 3-body effects ( paczynski 1977 ) .",
    "ogilvie extends the model of paczynski from 2 to 3 dimensions , allowing for a complete set of physical conditions in his model .",
    "he concludes that , due to tidal distortions , some regions of the disc would thicken , later being irradiated by the white dwarf .",
    "the pattern of thickening would be slightly spiral , but no waves or shocks would be involved in the process . in doppler tomography",
    "the pattern would show up as the kind of open spiral structure seen in published tomograms .",
    "these two competing explanations predict a different evolution of the spiral structures from outburst to quiescence .",
    "the spiral shock model requires hot material to have open spirals . in quiescence , the spirals , if present , are expected to be relatively tightly wound ( steeghs and stehle 1999 ) .",
    "assuming that the asymmetries that we see are indeed related to the outburst spiral structure , our observations show little change in morphology from outburst to quiescence , i.e. the spirals do not appear tightly wound .",
    "this argues against the spiral shock model as an explanation of the spiral structure detected in u  gem and favours ogilvie s ( 2002 ) and smak s ( 2001 ) explanation .",
    "although similar patterns are seen in several lines , we remain cautious about claiming a definitive detection of spiral structure in the quiescent u  gem .",
    "we emphasize again that the maps are really extremely symmetrical , and given the presence of strong bright - spot components which have strengths modulated in orbital phase , it is hard to rule out the possibility that we are seeing low - level artefacts",
    ". it is also worth noting that the size of the disc we find from the bright - spot of @xmath100.3a ( section [ sec : bright_spot ] ) is close to the minimum observed radius of u  gem s disc ( smak 1984 ) and well inside the tidal radius where one would expect ogilvie s and smak s model to operate , let alone tidally - driven spiral shocks .",
    "a notable feature in most of the tomograms , in particular in , is the mass donor s irradiated face .",
    "small sections of these maps , centered on the donor star , are presented in the top row of figure [ fig : disc_shielding ] .",
    "the figure shows that the irradiation - induced emission avoids the equator of the mass donor , indicative of shielding by the disc ( harlaftis 1999 ; morales - rueda et al .",
    "the irradiation in  and  seems to be located further from the l1 point than for the other lines .",
    "this is suggestive of a changing effective thickness due to wavelength dependent opacity at the euv wavelengths needed for photoionisation of the elements involved .",
    "this has been previously seen in other cvs ( morales - rueda et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in the bottom row of figure  [ fig : disc_shielding ]",
    "we show simulated tomograms for a system with the same parameters of u gem but with varying height - to - radius ratio ( h / r ) in the disc .",
    "we included some broadening in the simulations by convolving the synthetic datasets with a gaussian with fwhm @xmath15 .",
    "values of h / r from 0.10 to 0.25 were considered ( increasing by 0.05 each time ) . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the height completely prevents the irradiation to take place .",

    "these values could be a little smaller if @xmath17 is larger than we have assumed ( raising the roche lobes of figure  [ fig : disc_shielding ] ) , as suggested by the sharp spot in heii ( section  [ sec : bright_spot ] ) .       and",

    "the central panels were processed to improve visibility of the extension of the eclipse ( see text for details ) .",

    "note that the data are affected by emission components not included in our simulations.,width=384 ]    zhang & robinson ( 1987 ) derived an orbital inclination angle @xmath19 for u  gem from a detailed lightcurve fitting model .",
    "other estimates of @xmath20 have displayed a trend to somewhat smaller values , but mainly in the region of @xmath21 .",
    "given the radial velocity semi - amplitiudes , the inclination determines the component masses .",
    "long ( 2000 ) and more recently naylor et al ( 2005 ) encountered a problem when combining a measurement of the gravitational redshift of the white dwarf , which fixes @xmath22 , with other constraints including inclination estimates .",
    "the problem , summarised in fig .  8 of naylor et al .",
    "is that the gravitational redshift gives a rather small radius for a given mass , which only crosses the hamada - salpeter mass - radius relationship for @xmath23 implying at the same time a low inclination of @xmath24 and a radius well below the value predicted from u  gem s uv spectrum and parallax ( long 2000 ; harrison 1999 ) .",
    "the hamada - salpeter relation and the radius measured from the uv flux are in agreement for a much higher inclination of @xmath25 to @xmath26 and a lower white dwarf mass , @xmath27 ( naylor et al . 2005 ) , but then one must suppose that the gravitational redshift , a combination of careful measurements from the uv ( long & gilliland 1999 ) and i - band ( naylor et al .",
    "2005 ) to be seriously in error .",
    "in this section we use the eclipse of the emission lines , and specifically the highest velocity in the lines that is eclipsed to provide a new independent constraint on the orbital inclination .",
    "we find a high inclination favouring the low - mass solution for the white dwarf .",
    "the key point is that in a partially eclipsing system , since the eclipse does not reach the white dwarf , there will be a velocity in the lines above which there is no eclipse .",
    "if we can determine this point , we can measure the inclination .",
    "we do so by simulating the eclipse and comparing the simulation with the data ( figure [ fig : eclipses ] ) .",
    "the top panel shows a simulated trailed spectra when @xmath20 is set to @xmath28 , with @xmath6 and @xmath29 set to the values mentioned before .",
    "the three central panels show real data after removal of the mean spectrum .",
    "the extension of the eclipse in these panels easily reaches @xmath30 while in the simulated data of the top panel it does not go beyond @xmath31 .",
    "the inclination must be larger than @xmath32 ; we favour a value of @xmath33 ( lowest panel , figure [ fig : eclipses ] ) .",
    "the emission line eclipse strongly favours the low - mass , high inclination solution and is in conflict with the measurements of gravitational redshift .",
    "our data allows us to check the systemic - velocity of the donor star which is one component of the gravitational redshift .",
    "we did this by subtracting from the dataset the orbital motion corresponding to the centroid of the mass donor s irradiated region .",
    "then we averaged the spectra in phase ranges for which the separation between the signal from the irradiated region and other contaminating signals ( bright spot , disc ) was maximum .",
    "this produced well defined peaks to which we fitted gaussian solutions .",
    "we calculated the systemic - velocity of the donor as the offset of the centre of the gaussians with respect to their wavelengths at rest .",
    "the result is @xmath34 ( average of ,  and ) .",
    "this is compatible with @xmath35 from naylor et al .",

    "the result , @xmath38 , can be used to test the effectiveness of the techniques already in use , which are mostly based on assuming that the emission lines originated on the accretion disc will provide information from which the motion of the white dwarf can be tracked .",
    "two traditional techniques to measure @xmath6 are the diagnostic diagram ( shafter , szkody & thorstensen 1986 ) and the light - centre diagram ( marsh 1988 ) .",
    "both use the double - gaussian method ( schneider & young 1980 ; hereafter sy80 ) to measure the radial velocities from a dataset .",
    "this method consists in convolving the continuum subtracted line with two gaussians of identical width and varying separations .    in the diagnostic diagram technique , the velocities measured",
    "are then fitted with an orbital solution @xmath39)$ ] , and the parameters of the fit are plotted in a diagram like those presented in figs .",

    "[ fig : rv_diag_halpha ] and [ fig : rv_diag_hbeta ] we see that this happens for a = @xmath41 giving values of @xmath6 = 95 and @xmath42 for  and  respectively .",
    "the plots in the diagnostic diagrams display curves that behave only partially as expected .",
    "in particular there is no simultaneous convergence towards final values in the panels ( compare , for instance , top and bottom panel of figure [ fig : rv_diag_halpha ] ) .    in the light - centre technique ,",
    "the radial velocities measured using the double - gaussian method are plotted in velocity space and the line of points obtained is extrapolated towards the @xmath43 axis .",
    "the value for @xmath6 is the point at which the extrapolated line crosses @xmath43 .",
    "the plot obtained , not reproduced here , is very similar to figure  [ fig : rv_new_method ] , which is described below .",
    "a problem with the double gaussian measurement is that each spectrum is treated one by one , before the individual radial velocities are fitted by a sinusoid .",
    "the process breaks down as soon as the signal - to - noise in one of the spectra becomes too low for the measurements to be made .",
    "we can do somewhat better by fitting all spectra simultaneously , still employing the double - gaussian method because of its isolation of particular velocities in the line profiles . denoting the velocity , flux and uncertainty of the @xmath20-th pixel of the @xmath44-th spectrum by @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively",
    ", we therefore miminise the following function : @xmath48^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the velocity of a pixel relative to the velocity of the spectrum @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 is a weighting function given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 represents two gaussians of standard deviation @xmath55 separated by @xmath56 , @xmath57 the function of eq .",
    "[ eq : chi2 ] is minimised by fitting the velocities of the spectra @xmath50 , @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",

    "the difference is that we do not allow the @xmath50 to be independent , but instead constrain them to represent a circular orbit as so : @xmath62 fitting instead the standard orbital parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath43 .",
    "uncertainties were estimated by a bootstrap procedure ( diaconis & efron 1983 ) , with 1000 bootstrap samples being chosen from the original set of spectra .",
    "the end products are @xmath64 and @xmath43 values as a function of gaussian separation , exactly as with the old procedure .",
    "the gain is greater robustness in the presence of noise .",
    "figure [ fig : rv_new_method ] shows the application of this new method for performing the analysis of radial velocities .",
    "we use a small cross to mark the point with coordinates ( 0,-107.1 ) @xmath65 , the direct measurement for @xmath6 from long & gilliland ( 1999 ) .",
    "the points in the diagrams show the variation with separation for two gaussians of fwhm @xmath66 .",
    "the initial separation is @xmath67 and is marked with a large grey circle .",
    "small circles mark steps of @xmath68 while large circles marks steps of @xmath69 . in both panels",
    "an inset with a blow up of the region close to ( 0,-107.1 ) @xmath65 has been included . in the insets",
    "we have ommited the error bars .",
    "although the  plot does on two occasions shows trends towards the known value , it would be impossible in the absence of long & gillilands s value to deduce it from our measurements , although they are at least in its vicinity .",
    "this should not come as a suprise ; the diagnostic diagrams have a phase offset from zero , and whatever causes the distortion will distort the new method as well .",
    "the chief conclusion is that even far in the wings , there is something that distorts the radial amplitudes by of the order @xmath2 to @xmath68 , and that we can not improve on stover s ( 1981 ) estimate of @xmath70 .",
    "we carried out several simulations to see what could disturb the wing velocities using the model applied in section  [ sec : inclination_angle ] .",
    "we began the simulations considering just an accretion disc and an opaque secondary star . in this way we obtained double - peaked phase - shifted spectra",
    "in which an eclipse by the secondary star was included but no flux was contributed by it to the spectra .",
    "we found that both techniques were able to accurately recover the correct value for @xmath6 from this dataset .",
    "we then added a nearby line so that the separation and relative fluxes of both lines would approximate the situation of having  or  close to  or  respectively .",
    "again both methods correctly extracted @xmath6 from the data",
    ". then we added a bright spot ( its parameters tuned to fit the feature observed in our data ) to the main line ( -like and -like ) and found that the measurements were seriously distorted by its presence .",
    "however , after increasing the gaussian separation beyond @xmath71 the methods again reliably extracted @xmath6 from the data .",
    "lastly , we added a bright spot to the companion lines ( -like and -like ) and found that the recovery of @xmath6 was no longer possible .    in summary",
    ", we can not recover u gem s @xmath6 to better than @xmath72 , and we suspect that the problem is caused by the need to go far into the line wings to avoid the bright - spot , which brings with it the problem of contamination by the bright - spot emission of nearby lines .",
    "we have presented high spectral resolution and signal - to - noise optical spectra of u  gem with the aim of testing the use of the broad emission lines in tracing the motion of the accreting white dwarf in cvs .",
    "u  gem is particularly well suited for this task because the true motion of its white dwarf has been measured from _",
    "_ spectra by long et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "despite observations on a @xmath73m - class telescope of one the brightest dwarf novae , we find values of the semi - amplitude of the white dwarf ranging from 80 to @xmath74 which contain not a hint that the correct value is the @xmath75 measured by long et al ( 1999 ) . neither the diagnostic diagram ( shafter et al 1986 ) nor the light centre technique ( marsh 1988 ) were of any help .",
    "the root cause of the problem seems to be the bright - spot which causes an asymmetry that extends to large velocities in doppler maps , and which is present in the same way in pairs of close spectral lines (  and ;  and ) , thus violating the usual assumption of a trend towards symmetry at high velocity .",
    "our data reveal a number of new phenomena for which we can offer only tentative explanations .",
    "these include low velocity absorption and emission that we suggest imply the presence of prominences on the mass donor star .",
    "u  gem shows a complex structure in the region of the gas stream / impact region .",
    "extended emission lies between the velocity expected for the ballistic gas stream directly and the velocity of the keplerian disc along the gas stream .",
    "this emission extends both to very high and very low velocities in the maps .",
    "most surprising of all is the presence of a narrow component of the bright - spot in , which appears to be unresolved even at @xmath76,@xmath77 .",
    "this narrow spot appears to come from the disc rather than the stream , but seems to require a slightly larger value of radial velocity amplitude for the secondary star than has been measured to date .",
    "we find no evidence of stream overflow , but we find weak spiral asymmetry in the ( quiescent ) disc , similar in nature to those seen during outburst",
    ". this may provide support for ogilvie s and smak s explanation for the presence of spiral structure based upon 3-body effects .",
    "we find an inclination angle of @xmath78 .",
    "this supports a solution for the mass of u  gem s white dwarf in agreement with the hamada - salpeter mass - radius relationship and with the radius measured from the uv flux .",

    "in a doppler tomogram is usually possible to find at least two closed contours at a particular flux level .",
    "this happens because the tomogram is usually dominated by the disc continuum , in such a way that the flux increases from the centre of the map towards a ring of maximum intensity , the flux then decreasing from this ring outwards .",
    "this scenario makes the traditional methods to fit ellipses from the field of galactic surface photometry unstable ( e.g. kent 1983 , jedrzejewski 1987 ) , because in them most levels occur only once . on the other hand ,",
    "the techniques employed in computer vision , for the characterization of conics in an image , are very suitable for application here .",
    "we devised a new strategy by dividing the problem in two stages :        tracing the contours at a certain level and extracting the points pertaining to a single closed contour at the same level are two completely different problems .",
    "the former is readily solved in a purely graphical manner ( e.g. burke 1987 ) , while the latter ( ours ) is non - trivial and , as far as we know , not certainly solvable without human assistance .",
    "consequently the first stage admits several approaches varying in efficiency .",
    "we devised one in which from many angular directions either zero or one pixel was chosen , according to its proximity to the pixel selected in the previous direction and to the general pattern of the contours ( e.g. no crossed contours were allowed ) .",
    "the procedure could be carried out almost on its own in the case of a smooth continuum , but it required close supervision when dealing with finely detailed ( or noisy ) structure .",
    "the main danger is for the algorithm not to close the contour or to take a wrong detour before coming back to the expected path .",
    "once all the points for a particular level were chosen , we fitted them with ellipses according to an analytical ellipse - specific method proposed by fitzgibbon , pilu & fischer ( 1999 ) .",
    "the task is accomplished via a very efficient matrix procedure . in a non - matrix form",
    "we can explain the procedure as the fitting of a general conic of the form : @xmath79 but adding the constraint : @xmath80 so that the result will specifically be an ellipse .",
    "the constraint adds an arbitrary factor of scaling to the solution , but the algorithm provides for the removal of the effect at a later stage .",
    "the resulting general coefficients @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 were converted to the more meaningful values @xmath87,@xmath88 ( coordinates of the centre of the ellipse ) , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ( size of the two semiaxes ) , @xmath91 ( eccentricity ) and @xmath92 ( angle of rotation ) .",
    "uncertainties were estimated by a bootstrap procedure over the points .    the solution given by the method of fitzgibbon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) has been proved to be unique , but it must be noted that it has a certain bias to low eccentricities , specially if only a few points are fed to the algorithm . this is fine for our purposes because we use many points for the fitting ( basically limited by the resolution of the map ) and also we do not want unrealistically high values for @xmath91 ( which for an accretion disc we expect to be close to 0 for most isophotes ) .",
    "if this was a problem , the bias could be removed by another bootstrap procedure at the cost of computing time ( see , for instance , cabrera & meer 1996 ) .          by subtracting the disk from the original doppler map we can greatly improve the visibility of asymmetrical features .",
    "although we expect disc isophotes to have low values of @xmath91 , this value is generally not be exactly 0 .",
    "we therefore used the results from the ellipse - fitting process described above to subtract an interpolated elliptical background . to do this",
    ", we found for every point the two closest ellipses and then we linearly interpolated their fluxes according to the distance of the point to both ellipses .",
    "special cases were : a point exactly in the path of an ellipse ( its flux was used ) , and points beyond the region fitted ( no flux was assigned ) ."
