    "the lines at 1031.96  and 1037.60  are far more intense in sunspots than in the quiet sun ( @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution of sunspots to the total integrated disk spectrum seen by o@xmath1 ions in the corona is therefore non negligible .",
    "this has important consequences on the interpretation of observed lines in the corona ( @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to understand the formation mechanisms of these lines in sunspots .",
    "we present an analysis of sumer observations of a sunspot from march 18 , 1999 .",
    "we discuss the interaction between the lines and the emission line of molecular hydrogen h@xmath0 at 1031.87 .",
    "we use the reference spectrum obtained by the sumer spectrometer onboard the soho spacecraft on march 18 , 1999 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these observations were made with the detector b and lasted for 7 hours .",
    "the spectrometer slit ( 0.3@xmath2120 ) was kept at a fixed position centered on the sunspot ( fig .",
    "[ nl - fig : sunspot context ] , left ) and compensation for the solar rotation was turned on . from the mdi continuum intensity",
    "we estimate the location of the sunspot umbra to be between 364  and 382  on the sumer slit ( fig .",
    "[ nl - fig : sunspot context ] , right ) .",
    "the surrounding penumbra is between 344  and 364 , and between 382  and 392 .",
    "the upper and lower parts of the slit are on the quiet sun .",
    "these features will now be denoted u , p , and qs , respectively .",
    "the two panels of fig .",
    "[ nl - fig : ovi ] show how the intensities of the lines are affected by the different physical conditions in the quiet sun , in the penumbra , and in the umbra .",
    "the integrated intensities have been determined by a simple integration over the line profiles .",
    "the intensity profile of the lines is similar to what has been observed by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "an interesting and important feature is that the ratio between the two lines significantly deviates from its average value .",
    "while it is around 2 on qs , it reaches values greater than 8 in the southern umbra / penumbra interface .",
    "this implies that the coronal o@xmath3 ions , which are sensitive to the disk radiation , are illuminated by a radiation field which may very well be different from the averaged one ( qs ) that is usually assumed .",
    "doppler dimming diagnostic techniques using the doublet line ratios , are sensitive to the value of the ratio on the disk . adopting a value of 2 for the line ratio and a homogeneous disk could lead to spurious results of ion speeds in the corona considering the impact that sunspots can have on the disk radiation field",
    "this is due to the presence of h@xmath0 emission at 1031.87  ( @xcite ) in the 11 werner band .",
    "this molecular line is excited by resonance fluorescence from the line .",
    "the two panels in fig .  [ nl - fig : nv ] present the integrated intensities and intensity ratio of the two lines at 1239 and 1243  from the same data set as .",
    "the and doublets are in the lithium - like sequence .",
    "the doublet is very similar to ( same collisional excitation coefficient ratio and similar temperature of formation ) , so the 1239/1243 intensity ratio should be close to 2 at all temperatures , even accross the sunspot .",
    "this proves the special case of due to its interaction with the h@xmath0 lines in the q3 band .",
    "furthermore , the sumer data shows that the lines at 1036.3 and 1037  are fainter in the sunspot region .",
    "this is expected as the lines of first ions are reduced in intensity over sunspots ( @xcite ) .",
    "this may in turn have implications for the pumping of the coronal 1037  line at speeds above @xmath4100  km / s .",
    "werner band lines across the sunspot .",
    "the solid line shows the difference i ( 1032)-2@xmath2i ( 1038 ) .",
    "the enhancement of intensity at the sides of the sunspot is interesting , and is possible evidence of ambipolar diffusion of h@xmath0 from the umbra , that is , h@xmath0 and other neutrals can diffuse across the near - vertical magnetic field of the sunspot umbra ( @xcite).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figure  [ nl - fig : ovidiff ] helps us to quantify the amount of h@xmath0 molecular emission present in the sumer sunspot observations by assuming that the integrated intensity at 1032  is normally the double of the intensity at 1038 .",
    "this figure also presents the normalized intensity profiles of four h@xmath0 werner band lines across the sunspot .",
    "these lines are not blended with other uv lines , therefore they predict what the 1031.87  11 line would look like in the absence of interaction with .",
    "the relative intensity of all these lines agree closely with the calculated emission transition probabilities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can see that h@xmath0 and o@xmath3 interaction is significant in the sunspot area only .",
    "the sunspot s molecular h@xmath0 line interacting with the lines is one of many in the h@xmath0 werner band .",
    "theory gives relative intensities for each line , and this theory has been tested by @xcite on the sumer sunspot data .",
    "this means that we can know very closely the h@xmath0 emission in the 11 band at 1031.87 , which is the one that pumps the 1031.9 , just by looking at a clean line ( e.g. , the 13 band at 1119 ) and multiplying by the theoretical intensity ratio between the two given in @xcite .    in a future work we will model a slab of oxygen ions in the transition region above a sunspot and calculate the 1032 and 1038 line intensities emitted by the slab purely by collisions",
    "then , using a radiative transfer code , we will add the h@xmath0 line intensity at the bottom of the slab , and study the pumping of 1032  that ensues ."
