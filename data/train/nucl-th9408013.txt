    "<S> submitted to physics letter b    we explore the possibility to verify vector meson dominance for the nucleon by measuring the half - off - shell form factor in the vector - meson mass region . </S>",
    "<S> cross sections for the process @xmath0 be presented .    </S>",
    "<S> there exists by now a vast amount of experimental data on the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these data were obtained with electron scattering experiments yielding information on the form factor in the space - like sector . the form factor in the time - like region </S>",
    "<S> has been explored by @xmath1 annihilation experiments ; because of the masses of the particles involved this channel is open only for @xmath2 .    to explain </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of photons to hadrons vector meson dominance ( vmd ) has been invoked ; in this picture one assumes that the photons couple to hadrons only through the vector mesons . while this picture is well established for the pion , the situation for the nucleon is less obvious @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally determined form factors have been shown to follow very well the so - called dipole fit @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that not a monopole , but a dipole dependence appears here presents a problem for naive vector meson dominance since the form factor should contain the vector meson propagator only linearly . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , coupling constants often agree only within factors of 2 with the predictions of vector meson dominance @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are essentially two classes of explanations for the unexpected @xmath5-dependence of the propagators . in the first one </S>",
    "<S> assumes that the observed form factor is the _ sum _ of contributions of several vector mesons and that these contributions conspire such that the effective @xmath5-dependence is of dipole type @xcite . to this class of models </S>",
    "<S> we also count the attempts to describe the form factor as a sum of two terms , one describing the coupling of the photon to the meson cloud ( vector meson dominance ) and a second giving the direct coupling of the photon to the quark core @xcite . in the second class of explanations </S>",
    "<S> one assumes that the effective form factor is the _ product _ of the vector meson propagator and a cut - off form factor of monopole type that takes the properties of perturbative qcd at large @xmath6 into account @xcite . both of these models , </S>",
    "<S> if extended into the timelike sector , give large , resonance - like contributions at the vector - meson mass @xmath7 gev @xcite which , of course , have never directly been seen because they lie in the so - called unphysical region which is not accessible in on - shell processes . there </S>",
    "<S> the models as well as the dispersion theoretical analyses @xcite have to be considered as analytic continuations from the space - like measurements into the time - like region , and , more specifically , to the on - shell point there . the direct experimental proof for vmd for the nucleon , the presence of a clear resonance in its electromagnetic form factor just as for the pion , is thus still missing .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we explore the possibility to ascertain the resonance behavior of the form factor expected from vmd by determining experimentally the _ half - off - shell _ form factor of the nucleon in the time - like region just mentioned . </S>",
    "<S> if measured , this form factor could then be analytically continued to the on - shell point even at time - like @xmath5 in the unphysical region . </S>",
    "<S> this continuation from a time - like half - off - shell point may supplement and be even more conclusive and more stringent than the continuation from spacelike , on - shell points .    </S>",
    "<S> one way to explore the half - off - shell form factor in the time - like region is that of dilepton production in elementary processes . </S>",
    "<S> the dls group at the bevalac @xcite has recently undertaken such experiments both for @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions . </S>",
    "<S> first theoretical analyses @xcite indicate a sensitivity of the invariant - mass spectra to the electromagnetic form factor . </S>",
    "<S> however , the results of these experiments do not allow for an easy , unambigous extraction of the form factor , because the strong - interaction vertices affect the cross - section . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for quite early experiments employing the reaction @xmath10 @xcite .    in order to avoid the ambiguities necessarily connected with the presence of strong - interaction vertices and form factors we propose to explore a purely electromagnetic reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the process we consider is compton - scattering of a real photon into the time - like sector , i. e. the process @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> real compton scatttering in the energy range considered here , i.e. up to 1 gev photon energy , has been investigated in refs . @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors have given a decomposition of the compton scattering amplitude @xmath12 into a resonance contribution @xmath13 and into a non - resonant born amplitude @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> the born amplitudes are given in detail in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the exponential multiplying it damps the backward - angle scattering and represents an ad - hoc correction that takes neglected effects such as the @xmath15-channel scattering into account ; @xmath16 is the photon scattering angle in the c.m </S>",
    "<S> . frame .    </S>",
    "<S> while for the resonance amplitude the _ u_-channel is neglected , the only contribution to this amplitude is the _ </S>",
    "<S> s_-channel @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the mass of the resonance , @xmath20 its width and w the invariant energy . the phases @xmath21 are introduced to take the relative phases between the various resonances and the born amplitude into account . </S>",
    "<S> for later purposes we have written eq.([amplitude2 ] ) in a form also correct for off - shell photons ( @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> essential for our purposes here is the structure of the elastic photon width @xmath23 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amplitude2 ] ) which is given by @xmath24 with the form factor @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the spin of the resonance and @xmath27 the photon coupling constants of the resonance . for all further details </S>",
    "<S> see wada et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis includes all resonances up to a mass of about 2 gev ; in the following we use the parameters extracted there from fitting compton scattering data in the energy range up to 1.2 gev .    in order to use this information on the electromagnetic vertices of the nucleon for our purpose of investigating the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon in the time - like sector </S>",
    "<S> , we now consider the general structure of the electromagnetic vertex appearing in the @xmath28 process . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that both electromagnetic vertices are half - off shell , at the entrance point for an on - shell photon and at the exit point for a virtual time - like photon . </S>",
    "<S> the general structure of the electromagnetic half - off - shell vertex has recently been investigated in detail by tiemeijer and tjon @xcite and naus and koch @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these authors have shown that the general electromagnetic form factor for a half - off - shell vertex depends on the squares of the fourmomentum of the photon , @xmath6 , and of the off - shell nucleon , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the original 6 different form factors to only 1 is possible when using gauge - invariance , particle - antiparticle symmetry @xcite and the experimentally well established equality of electric and magnetic form factors in the space - like region .    in order to explore the sensitivity of the dilepton invariant mass spectra on a possible vmd form of the form factor we now extend the electromagnetic form factor ( [ photonwidth ] ) into the region @xmath22 and multiply a vmd based factor @xmath31 to it . </S>",
    "<S> we thus make the ansatz @xmath32 with @xmath33 for the form factor in the timelike region . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity at @xmath34 is avoided by implementing the decay width of the vectormesons in the denominator of @xmath31 in ( [ formfact2 ] ) . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume the same form factor for all the hadrons in the timelike region . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the analysis of stoler that shows that the spacelike form factors of all the resonances agree within a few percent for @xmath35 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is now straigthforward to generalize the amplitude - based description of compton scattering of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to virtual photons . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by using in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ amplitude2 ] ) and ( [ photonwidth ] ) the momentum of a massive photon created in the resonance decays . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the real compton amplitude the photon vertex @xmath23 is replaced @xmath36 the superscripts in parenthesis give the helicity quantum numbers , @xmath37 is the invariant mass of the dilepton pair , @xmath38 the massive photon s propagator and @xmath39 the dilepton current .    in this way we take into account that the massive photon can be polarized in longitudinal direction . for the longitudinal contribution </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath40 thus we can use for this amplitude also the photon coupling constant @xmath41 from ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the nucleon poles is calculated exactly . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we retain the experimentally determined half - off - shell vertex for real photons and extend it to the time - like photon vertex . </S>",
    "<S> we also ensure by construction that the cross - section for dilepton production reduces at the photon point to the experimentally correct compton scattering value .    within this description </S>",
    "<S> we are able to calculate the amplitude for the feynman diagrams shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and 1b . </S>",
    "<S> for the creation of virtual photons we also have to add contributions to the amplitude from the so called _ bethe - heitler _ diagrams ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c ) ; for the corresponding space - like form factor we use the measured one . because of the pole - like behaviour of the electron propagator this contribution dominates in any integrated cross section </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we look only at a five - times differential cross section , very similiar to what was done in @xcite . in this symmetric kinematical situation ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) it was shown that the influence of the bethe - heitler diagrams decreases with increasing angle @xmath42 ( ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the invariant mass of the dilepton pair is a simple function of only this opening angle .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible in this kinematical situation that a given invariant mass corresponds to two different angles , one less and one larger than @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath44 we show only the invariant mass spectra above 400 mev , because for smaller masses ( = smaller angles ) the contribution from the bethe - heitler diagrams dominates the spectrum . even for larger invariant masses </S>",
    "<S> the bethe - heitler contribution is the main contribution to the cross section ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) if we switch off the vmd form factor for the hadrons by setting @xmath45 . since the contribution of the nucleons ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 : dotted line ) is dominated by the bethe - heitler diagrams , it shows only a weak resonance shape . but a resonance behaviour is definitely seen for the contribution of the nucleon resonances which is , now including the vmd , larger than the bethe - heitler contribution . because of the weak sensitivity of the cross section to the nucleon form factor it may be possible to get information on the electromagnetic form factor for the resonances if the detection angle of the leptons is less than 90 degree , but the signal sits on a steeply falling background </S>",
    "<S> .    if the angle is larger than @xmath46 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) , we find a strong effect of the vmd on the nucleon as well as the resonance contribution , because now the influence of the bethe - heitler diagrams is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> for this kinematic situation we see in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 that the resonance contribution is now larger than the nucleonic one by roughly a factor of two .    after fixing the resonance form factors @xmath47 in the forward region it might be possible to extract from the cross section in backward kinematics the form factors @xmath48 for the nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> because the resonances are propagated with @xmath49 , necessary to get dilepton invariant masses well above the vector meson region , many of them are excited and it may not be possible to disentangle their form factors separately . however , on the basis of stoler s analysis @xcite , which shows that the spacelike form factors of all resonances roughly agree in the momentum range considered here , we expect that at least an average form factor can be extracted which is not too different from the individual ones .    our calculations thus show that indeed sizeable effects from time - like electromagnetic form factors on the dilepton mass spectra are to be expected in @xmath50 experiments . </S>",
    "<S> due to the different effects in forward and backward scattering of the proton it is possible to obtain information on the form factors for the nucleon as well as for some of the resonances in the time - like sector in a momentum range where so far no other information is available .    the authors like to thank to y. wada for providing us with his earlier results and his original source code .    99    g. hhler , e. pietarinen , i. sabba - stefanescu , f. borkowski , g.g . </S>",
