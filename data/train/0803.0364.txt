    "spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum information processing due to their long decoherence and relaxation time.@xcite some schemes , such as solid state spin qbuits , further enjoy the potential scalability via the integration with nanotechnology.@xcite however , spin qubits are not totally immune from the ubiquitous decoherence . to describe the bath that causes the decoherence of spin qubits , it is known that in some cases , the bath is better modeled by spins instead of delocalized oscillators , resulting in the so - called spin baths.@xcite",
    "it has been argued that the influence of spin baths may be qualitatively different from bosonic baths and non - markovian dynamics can easily emerge.@xcite due to the growing interest in spin baths , the decoherence behavior and the entanglement dynamics of few qubits coupled to spin baths have been studied extensively in recent years .",
    "early works focus on the decoherence due to independent spins.@xcite here although the proposed model formally resembles a spin boson model , non - markovian already emerges even when bath modes are not interacting.@xcite in real baths , however , spins are not independent .",
    "it is therefore important to include effects due to interactions of spins in the bath .",
    "nonetheless , the inclusion of the intra - spin interaction in the bath complicates the problem and only for some limited models with high symmetry , exact reduced dynamics can be identified .",
    "@xcite beyond models with exact solutions , approximated dynamics was obtained by using mean - field@xcite or perturbative approaches@xciteto handle more generic models .",
    "the most common model employed in these works is the `` central spin model '' , where the qubits are uniformly coupled to all spins of the bath . while analytical derivations are possible in these models , they are less realistic and are more difficult to be implemented experimentally . a non - perturbative approach that can capture the non - markovian effects induced by interacting spin bath with generic coupling to qubits is hence highly desirable .    to overcome the difficulty associated with interacting spins , we utilize the method of time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) @xcite to investigate the reduced dynamics of single or two qubits coupled to an interacting spin chain .",
    "recently , t - dmrg has been used to study the single qubit pure dephasing induced by a @xmath0 anisotropic spin chain.@xcite the advantage of t - dmrg is its ability to calculate reduced dynamics even when the spin bath is not integrable and the coupling is not uniform . due to the accumulation of errors , t - dmrg will eventually run away at large time@xcite but this does not impose serious limitation since for the study of quantum information we are mostly interested in some smaller time scale . in this work",
    "we apply the method of t - dmrg to investigate both pure dephasing and general decoherence model of qubits coupled to spin baths .",
    "single qubit decoherence as well as two qubits ( dis)-entanglement dynamics are investigated .",
    "it is shown that both decoherence and entanglement strongly depend on the phase of the spin bath .",
    "in general , we find that spin baths can induce entanglement for an initially disentangled pair of qubits .",
    "however , when the spin bath is in the ferromagnetic phase , because qubits directly couple to the order parameter , the reduced dynamics shows oscillatory type behavior . on the other hand , only for paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases , initially entangled states suffer from the entanglement sudden death.@xcite    to quantify the single spin decoherence , we evaluate the evolution of the loschmidt echo.@xcite we analyze the relation between the short time loschmidt echo decay parameter and the quantum phases of the spin bath , as it has been pointed out that these two are closely related , especially when a symmetry breaking occurs in the bath.@xcite we use the temporal evolution of concurrence@xcite to study the entanglement dynamics .",
    "one important issue of entanglement dynamics is the possibility of creating entanglement through a common bath for originally dis - entangled qubits .",
    "it has been shown that induced entanglement via a common bath is possible for bosonic and fermionic baths.@xcite for spin baths such a possibility has been explored for non - interacting spin bath@xcite as well as interacting ones@xcite but is restricted to uniform coupling models . it will be shown later in this paper that induced entanglement is possible for local coupling model considered in this work .",
    "we note that the induced entanglement is also closely related to recent proposals of quantum communication and teleportation via spin chain.@xcite    another important issue is the disentanglement dynamics of an initially entangled state .",
    "it has attracted much attention in recent years since yu and eberly@xcite and jakbczyk and jamrz@xcite predicted that two initially entangled state without interaction can become completely disentangled at finite time .",
    "this feature has been termed entanglement sudden death ( esd ) .",
    "esd has been studied theoretically within various models @xcite and has been demonstrate experimentally.@xcite these models , however , are restricted to markovian bosonic bath or classical noise . in this work we explore for the first time if esd - like phenomena can occur for spin baths in non - markovian regime .",
    "in particular , we will show that only when the spin bath are paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic , the phenomenon of esd occurs , while when the spin bath is in the ferromagnetic phase , concurrence shows oscillatory behavior .",
    "as understanding the nature of the ( dis)-entanglement dynamics constitutes an important step for quantum engineering these systems , our results are of practical usage for future quantum information processing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we consider a system - bath model which is described by the total hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of a single or two qubits system , @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of a spin bath and @xmath4 represents the interaction between qubits and the bath",
    ". we shall set @xmath5 but our method can be applied to a generic @xmath2 .",

    "it is known that the @xmath0 heisenberg model has a very rich structure.@xcite the system is ferromagnetic for @xmath8 , antiferromagnetic ( ising - type ) for @xmath9 , and critical ( xy - type ) for @xmath10 .",
    "it also encompasses the @xmath11 model where @xmath12 .",
    "the most general linear coupling between qubit @xmath13 and the bath can be expressed as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 characterizes the coupling of the spin qubit to the @xmath18th spin in the spin chain . for most situations ,",
    "the more interesting cases are @xmath19 @xcite and hence we shall concentrate on negative @xmath20 . our numerical method ,",
    "however , can be applied equally well to cases with positive @xmath20 . in our work",
    ", both the ising coupling and isotropic heisenberg coupling will be considered . the ising coupling ( @xmath21 )",
    "gives rise to a pure dephasing model while the isotropic heisenberg coupling ( @xmath22 ) induces both dephasing and energy relaxation .",
    "the range of the coupling is crucial for characterizing the interaction of qubits to the spin bath",
    ". for uniform coupling @xmath17 is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "this is unrealistic but for uniform coupling the loschmidt echo and the entanglement dynamics can be calculated exactly by using jordan - wigner transformation when the spin bath is the @xmath11 model ( @xmath12).@xcite however , the more realistic coupling model is the local coupling model in which only the coupling to the closest spin is nonvanishing .",
    "nonetheless , there is no analytic solutions known for this model .",
    "the reduced dynamics is less studied but is more relevant to real experiments . in this case , if the spin bath is ferromagnetic , the qubit couples directly to the order parameter ( the magnetization ) ; while if the spin bath is antiferromagnetic or paramagnetic , the qubit does not couple to the order parameter .",
    "hence the reduced dynamics exhibits completely different behavior in different phases . as",
    "the local coupling model is more relevant to real experiments , in the following we shall concentrate on the local coupling model .",
    "we now briefly outline the procedure to evaluate the reduced dynamics of the qubits and other derived quantities . for a given set of parameters",
    ", we first employ static dmrg@xcite to find the ground state @xmath23 of the spin chain , where open boundary condition ( obc ) is used .",

    "we set @xmath31 in the trotter slicing while for entanglement dynamics we set @xmath32 to balance the trotter error and truncation error .",
    "in this section , we present our results for the single qubit decoherence which is characterized by the loschmidt echo .",
    "the loschmidt echo has been used extensively to quantify the single qubit decoherence , especially its connection to the quantum criticality of the spin baths .",
    "@xcite loschmidt echo can be understood intuitively as follows : consider an initially disentangled total state @xmath33 , at some later time @xmath34 it will evolve into an entangled state @xmath35 .",

    "when @xmath39 the qubit is disentangled from the bath while when @xmath40 the qubit is totally entangled with the bath .",
    "we start by noting that for numerical calculation on finite length , all dynamics will show quasi - periodic behavior .",
    "the quasi - period is known as the revival time . since in our numerical calculation",
    ", the spin bath is a chain of finite length , it is essential to identify the revival time for each length to avoid unphysical results due to revival . as a zeroth order approximation ,",

    "one clearly observes the liner dependence of revival time on the length .",
    "we find that for ising coupling the minimal value loschmidt echo reached is non - zero unless a very strong coupling strength is taken ( not shown here ) , while for heisenberg coupling , the loschmidt echo reaches zero if the length is longer than some @xmath41 dependent critical length .",

    "we tune the spin bath to different quantum phases by changing the parameter @xmath41 . in the ferromagnetic regime , a small uniform external field",
    "is introduced during the static - dmrg calculation but is turned off during time evolution .",

    "our numerical results also show that if the qubit is coupled to multiple sites , decay parameter acquires a weak dependence on @xmath41 and the transition near @xmath53 becomes less sharp ( not plotted ) .",
    "note that the decay parameter becomes sensitive to the magnitude of the small staggered field applied when the spin bath is close to the phase boundary @xmath54 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for finite @xmath55 the barrier between two degenerate ground states is finite and approaches zero as @xmath41 approaches @xmath56 .",
    "the ground state obtained by static dmrg includes a small mixture of the degenerate state , which is sensitive to the strength of the staggered field .",
    "for larger @xmath41 , the barrier between two degenerate ground states increases as one moves deep into the antiferromagnetic regime . as a result",

    "we now turn to the case of heisenberg coupling .",
    "we first note that in the ferromagnetic regime , the qubit couples to the order parameter .",
    "therefore , the qubit is effectively in an average magnetic field @xmath58 . as a consequence of the heisenberg coupling",
    ", the qubit will precess about @xmath59 .",
    "since magnons are generated at the same time when the qubit evolves , @xmath58 starts to deviate from @xmath60 and results in oscillations in the reduced dynamics .",
    "[ fig : positive ] shows some typical oscillating behavior of @xmath42 in this scenario . clearly , the reduced dynamics is no longer gaussian .",

    "[ fig : le - xyz ] we plot the decay parameter as a function of @xmath41 for the case of heisenberg coupling .",
    "the overall behavior is very similar to the case of ising coupling except that the decay parameter depends weakly on @xmath41 in the critical regime .",
    "this is different from the ising coupling case shown above but is similar to the multiple sites ising coupling case . for both ising and heisenberg coupling",
    "we find a discontinuity in the behavior of @xmath42 at @xmath61 and a first derivative discontinuity at @xmath53 .",
    "these discontinuities coincides with the phase boundary of the underlying spin chain .",
    "different behavior at the @xmath62 can be traced back to the different nature of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic transition and the close relation between the decoherence and the quantum criticality of the bath is clearly demonstrated .",
    "in this section , we investigate the entanglement dynamics of two qubits that couple to the spin bath .",
    "there are two central issues to be addressed .",

    "the second issue is the disentanglement dynamics of an initially entangled state . in particular",

    "@xmath12 and @xmath50.,width=288 ]      it has been shown that entanglement can be created without direct interaction if two qubits interact with a common bosonic bath @xcite or a fermionic bath.@xcite of particular interest to us is the onset time of the entanglement , the strength of the induced entanglement , and the time scale where the induced decoherence eventually takes over .",
    "these considerations are important in determining if such an induced entanglement is useful in real quantum computation .",
    "the issue is also closely related to the proposals of induced interaction via a common bath , @xcite where the effect of induced decoherence from the same bath is usually neglected during the derivation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent - c - i ] we plot the concurrence as a function of time using various coupling strength and inter qubit distance .",

    "we shall set @xmath12 but similar results can ba obtained for @xmath71 .",
    "before we discuss our findings in more details we would like to comment that if markovian approximation or uniform coupling assumption are taken then one can no longer discuss the inter - qubit distance dependence .",
    "the relation between entanglement dynamics and inter - qubit distance , however , is gaining interest since people begin to explore the non - markovian effects of the bath .",
    "@xcite we terminate the simulation at half of the revival time , where usually loschmidt echo reaches its minimum , to avoid the unphysical dynamics due to the revival .",
    "we also numerically check the finite size effect by comparing the entanglement dynamics from different chain lengths .",
    "we find that the results from different chain lengths agree with each other reasonably well .",
    "the length of the chain mainly set an upper bound for the simulation time .",
    "we find that for this configuration it is possible to create entanglement via the spin bath . in particular , for weaker coupling strength the induced entanglement rises more slowly but can reach a higher value ; while for stronger coupling the induced entanglement rises more rapidly .",
    "the maximal concurrence reached , however , is lower .",
    "this is because larger coupling strength also lead to stronger decoherence .",
    "it is also evident from the figure that the entanglement creating rate decreases as the inter qubit distance increases , which is typical for this kind of induced interaction .",
    "we find that for large enough @xmath20 and the smaller enough inter qubit distance the concurrence shows oscillatory behavior . in these cases , the coupling is strong enough to create concurrence oscillation but also weak enough to prevent the bath to totally disentangle the qubits .",
    "the delicate interplay between induced decoherence and induced entanglement indicates that using such an induced entanglement for quantum computation is a tricky task .",
    "one has to tune the coupling to be within the right window to balance the effect from each side .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent - c - h ] we plot the concurrence as a function of time for the case of heisenberg coupling , starting form the same initial condition .",
    "qualitatively the behavior is similar to the case of ising coupling .",
    "we find that the maximal entanglement that can be reached is smaller .",
    "this is because for heisenberg coupling the loschmidt echo always decays to zero regardless the coupling strength while for ising coupling the minimal loschmidt echo value is a decreasing function of the coupling strength and is not zero .",
    "we also find that the onset time is roughly proportional to the inter qubit distance .",
    "this is expected as the excitation of spin chain , which mediate the entanglement generation , travels with finite phase velocity .",
    "the time the excitation reaches the other qubit would be proportional to the inter qubit distance . however , the concurrence oscillation is absent , indicating that the induced interaction is weaker for heisenberg coupling .",
    "we note that it is difficult to write down an exact form of the induced interaction unless markovian approximation is taken .",
    "in general the induced interaction is time - dependent and is accompanied by a complicate decoherence effect .",
    "it is , however , possible to perform quantum state tomography experimentally or numerically to extract kraus operators .",
    "the kraus operators can then be used to design quantum operations without using directly the form of the induced interaction .",
