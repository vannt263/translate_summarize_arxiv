    "in recent years , the weak radio core emission associated with the class of so - called ` radio - quiet ' quasars ( for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been shown by a succession of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) imaging experiments usually to be compact on milliarcsecond ( mas ) scales @xcite .",
    "the typical physical size of  a few cubic parsecs for these radio luminosities and corresponding brightness temperatures ( @xmath0k ) strongly argues against star - formation as the origin of this radio emission , despite the striking continuity of the correlation of far - infra - red and radio emission from star - forming galaxies to radio - quiet quasars @xcite .",
    "instead , a mechanism resembling that which powers the core emission in the more radio - luminous ` radio - loud ' quasars is suggested .",
    "one quasar in particular , pg1407 + 263 , identified in a mas imaging survey of radio - quiet quasars @xcite clearly has multiple components and seemed an important target to monitor subsequently with vlbi techniques .",
    "it was first discovered as a quasar in the palomar - green survey @xcite with @xmath1 @xcite . with a hubble constant of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , the luminosity distance @xmath4 and 1mas @xmath5 7.9pc .",
    "we observed pg1407 + 263 at 8.4ghz using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) with the very large array ( vla ) in phased array mode on 1996 june 15 ( vlba only ) , 1997 april 27 , 1998 january 31 , 1999 march 20 and 1999 july 20 .",
    "we usually recorded a 64-mhz bandwidth ( a 32-mhz bandwidth was used for epochs 4 & 5 ) with 2bit sampling and dual circular polarization .",
    "the observations were phase - referenced @xcite , i.e.  regular observations of a bright extragalactic source close on the sky to the target were made to derive residual antenna - based and atmospheric phase corrections , which were interpolated to calibrate the target data and provide accurate astrometric referencing .",
    "the calibrator source used was oq208 , separated from pg1407 + 263 by 2.2@xmath6 .",
    "we typically used a switching cycle of two minutes on the calibrator and three minutes on the target .",
    "the total on - source time for oq208 was 0.5hrs ( epoch 1 ) and 2.8hrs ( epochs 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ) . throughout the three - year monitoring ,",
    "a pair of  mjy components were persistently detected ( figure1 ) , albeit with changes in structure and flux density ( figure2 ) .",
    "one striking change seen between successive epochs is that the structure of each component appears to vary : this is particularly marked in the final three epochs ( figure1 ) .",
    "real changes in shape represent an intriguing aspect of the parsec - scale evolution of the source : since 1  mas corresponds to 7.9  pc , real expansion between epochs of one tenth of a synthesized beam would correspond to apparent motion of a few times the speed of light .",
    "the components appear both resolved and unresolved at different epochs .",
    "component b appears to be significantly resolved ( with a high total flux density ) in earlier epochs , while both components appear essentially unresolved ( with low flux densities ) in the final epoch .",
    "unmodeled residual spatial gradients in tropospheric ( and ionospheric ) delays lead to interferometer phase errors which are cancelled towards the bright calibrator source oq208 , but remain in the target data .",
    "thus , apart from the above general assertions above about component b , it is difficult to draw solid conclusions from the structural variations : simple centroid fitting to the components , while technically possible , can be ambiguous in interpretation .",
    "the rms variation of the position of component a is @xmath7@xmath8-arcsec .",
    "typical estimates of the effects of tropospheric delay errors on phase - referenced vlbi data with a calibrator 2.2deg away are 100200@xmath8-arcsec . in addition , the typical signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the detections is 510 to 1 ; this would introduce a positional variation roughly equal to the synthesized beam divided by the s / n  i.e.  100 to 250@xmath8-arcsec .",
    "therefore , the position wandering largely results from a combination of unmodeled tropospheric delay errors and s / n considerations . given the weak (  mjy ) flux density levels in these images , it is not possible to correct for these residual errors . during the course of these observations the relative position shift of components a and b appeared at times to be systematic , possibly indicating superluminal motion @xcite .",
    "analysis of the existing data set does not allow a definitive determination of superluminal motion in this radio - quiet quasar , although we in any case infer it to have a highly relativistic jet speed ( doppler factor @xmath9 ) in the analysis below .",
    "the rapid variations in component b s flux density are unlikely to result from imaging coherence loss , which would affect both components ; a s relatively constant peak flux density implies that b s flux density variations are intrinsic .",
    "the dramatic changes in b s flux density occur on timescales of 100300 days , reminiscent of those seen in the cores of radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "in order to establish whether pg1407 + 263 is truly a radio - quiet quasar , we made deep vla images to search for evidence of extended radio structure or hotspots .",
    "these images revealed only independent sources including an apparent double 53arcsec east of the quasar .",
    "@xcite commented that this double structure might be related to the output of the quasar , since it lacks any optical identification on the palomar observatory sky survey .",
    "we made a more sensitive test by observing the field in the near infra - red @xmath10-band on the uk infra - red telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "figure3 indicates each part of the ` double ' radio structure is identified with a galaxy and is thus unrelated to the quasar .",
    "therefore , we do not believe that pg1407 + 263 has been radio - loud for the last @xmath11years , where this timescale is taken from the typical radiative lifetimes for synchrotron - emitting particles in the lobes of radio - loud quasars @xcite .",
    "it is feasible that the observed structural changes in component b are related to at least one unresolved sub - component .",
    "the much closer source 3c120 @xcite is a good example of how jet knot components can appear and fade .",
    "gmez et al have interpreted this in terms of interaction between the jet and the inhomogeneous ambient medium",
    ". observed at lower resolution , the jet in 3c  120 would present apparently structurally changing partially resolved components .",
    "if we are indeed observing such a phenomenon , then the offset between the two local surface brightness maxima in component  b may give us some idea of the scale of the jet diameter .",
    "the perpendicular offset between the centroid of the two b subcomponents and the line connecting the two main components , a and b is about @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , in the following , we adopt a fiducial scale for the jet diameter , @xmath13 of @xmath14 . the causal limit on the diameter deduced from the variability time scale , @xmath15 , and",
    "corresponding to a doppler factor @xmath16 is : @xmath17 the variation from epochs 1 to 2 entails a factor @xmath18 decrease in flux density over a timescale @xmath19 .",
    "this implies an upper limit on the diameter @xmath20 for a doppler factor of 10 .",
    "this is intriguingly less than , but of the same order as , the approximate scale size estimated from the vlba images",
    ". of course , the discrepancy decreases with increasing doppler factor .",
    "[ if the jet is pole - on so that @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the bulk lorentz factor ) , given the existence of apparent proper motions @xmath23 in some quasars , then @xmath24 is not out of the question . ] clearly , the reconciliation of these two scales is in the direction of larger doppler factors , not smaller .",
    "this is an indication that this source is highly beamed .",
    "a second , more persuasive , indication for beaming comes from estimating the intrinsic source power .",
    "the emitted power per steradian is : @xmath25 , where the integral is that of the rest - frame emissivity , @xmath26 , at the _ observed _ frequency @xmath27 over the proper volume ( @xmath28 ) of each blob and @xmath29 is the flux density at @xmath27 .    for unity doppler factor ,",
    "the total emitted power , at 8.4  ghz , of both components at epoch  1 would be @xmath30 .",
    "this is comparable to the core powers of the most powerful galaxies in the b2 sample @xcite .",
    "if pg1407 + 263 were similar to the b2 sources then , using the statistical relationship between core and extended powers derived by @xcite , its corresponding 1.4  ghz extended power would be of order @xmath31 and the 8.4 ghz flux density would be of order one jansky .",
    "however , since the flux density of any extended emission from pg1407 + 263 is less than 0.1mjy , this is another indication that the core is beamed .",
    "the doppler factor has to be increased to @xmath32 in order to reduce the expected extended flux density to the observed upper limit .",
    "the additional parameters describing each knot are the spectral index @xmath33 , the electron energy index , @xmath34 , the volume , @xmath28 , of the knot in its rest frame , the doppler factor , @xmath16 and the ratio , @xmath35 , of energy in relativistic electrons and positrons to other particles .",
    "the rest - frame magnetic field that minimizes the total energy density of a spherical blob in the rest frame is :    @xmath36    @xmath37^{\\frac{2}{a+5 } }   \\ > { \\rm t}.$ ]    here @xmath38 is a coefficient involving @xmath22-functions that appears in the expression for the angle - averaged synchrotron emissivity ; @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the electronic charge , electronic mass and speed of light respectively , and @xmath42geoff / hea / hea.html ] .",
    "we have estimated the minimum - energy magnetic field and corresponding particle energy densities , from the flux density of component b at epoch  1 and for proper jet diameters of 0.375 , 0.75 and 1.5mas as functions of doppler factor .",
    "figure[f : energy ] shows the associated jet energy flux , @xmath43 \\ , \\gamma^2 c \\beta a_{\\rm jet}$ ] , where @xmath44 is the cross - sectional area of the jet , @xmath45 is the rest - mass density , and where the poynting flux of a perpendicular magnetic field has been included .",
    "we assume that the jet is pole - on and purely relativistic , so that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the almost constant value of the jet energy flux for doppler factors @xmath48 is the result of the @xmath49-dependence of the magnetic and particle energy densities canceling the @xmath50-dependence of the energy flux . if we assume that 0.75mas is a reasonable upper limit to the jet diameter , then the jet is no more powerful than about @xmath51 . for jet diameters less than the fiducial value the jet is less powerful , albeit still relativistic .",
    "we note that this is not the first radio - weak object for which relativistic velocities have been inferred .",
    "@xcite inferred superluminal motion from their observations of the seyfert galaxy iiizw2 , directly implying relativistic motion .",
    "the low extended emission relative to the core in pg1407 + 263 is a good argument that this jet is relativistically beamed .",
    "if our inference of partially resolved structure in the jet is correct then the case for relativistic beaming is reinforced by the variability time scale ( @xmath52 for epochs 1 - 2 ) . if the jet diameter is indeed @xmath53 then , given the typical expansion rates of jets , the components are of the order of 100pc from the core , placing them in the narrow - line region . these two arguments point to a doppler factor of @xmath54 . as figure  [",
    "f : energy ] shows , the dependence of energy flux on doppler factor and jet radius indicates a kinetic power no greater than about @xmath55 . using theoretical @xcite and observational @xcite relations between jet and radio power",
    ", such an energy flux would be typical of a radio galaxy jet no more than an order of magnitude above the fri / frii break @xcite .",
    "the interest that attends this galaxy is the existence of an fri radio power associated with a bright quasar so it is unsurprising that this quasar is classified as radio quiet @xcite .",
    "it appears the only reason that we detect any radio flux is that it is one of the few pg quasars that is beamed towards us .    as well as its variation between epochs 1 and 2 ,",
    "component b also exhibits a significant rise in flux density @xmath56 between epochs 3 and 4 then a sharp drop ( @xmath57 days ) between epochs 4 and 5 with @xmath58 .",
    "this variability indicates a diameter @xmath59 for component b around this epoch  much less than the indicative jet diameter @xmath53 inferred above .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( 1 ) the jet may not be as wide as 5pc or ( 2 ) the variation is due to a small section of the jet being affected by its interaction with clouds in the narrow - line region of the quasar .",
    "this second case is similar to what has been observed in 3c120 by @xcite .",
    "our observations therefore suggest a relativistic jet , of only moderate power , propagating through the clumpy narrow - line region of a bright host quasar .",
    "does our consideration of the radio structure of pg1407 + 263 shed any light on its curious optical properties e.g. , the low equivalent width of the emission lines @xcite",
    "? if the doppler factor of the jet is as high as 10 , then we are viewing pg1407 + 263 within a few degrees of pole - on and looking directly into its broad - line region .",
    "thus , the emission line spectrum may be diluted by a direct line of sight to the accretion disk continuum .",
    "an argument against this is that the pg quasars show no evidence for orientation - dependent effects and this is generally ascribed to the initial selection via ultra - violet excess .",
    "however , supporting evidence for pg1407 + 263 being close to pole - on is the large velocity dispersion of its emission line gas @xmath60 @xcite , indicating that we may be looking directly into the inner part of the broad - line region .",
