    "understanding interactions between light and matter in a dense atomic medium is a long - standing problem in physical science@xcite since the seminal work of dicke@xcite .",
    "in addition to their fundamental importance in optical physics , such interactions play a central role in enabling a range of new quantum technologies including optical lattice atomic clocks@xcite and quantum networks@xcite .",
    "the key ingredient in a dense sample is dipole - dipole interactions that arise from the exchange of virtual photons with dispersive and radiative contributions , and their relative magnitude varies between the near - field and far - field regimes .",
    "the dispersive ( real ) part is responsible for collective level shifts and the radiative ( imaginary ) part gives rise to line broadening and collective superradiant emission@xcite .",
    "intense theoretical efforts have been undertaken over many years to treat the complex interplay between the dispersive and radiative dynamics@xcite .",
    "however , experimental demonstrations that provide a complete picture to clarify these interactions have been elusive .    collective level shifts and line broadening arising from the real and imaginary parts of dipole - dipole interactions",
    "have recently been observed in both atomic@xcite and condensed matter@xcite systems .",
    "the modification of radiative decay dynamics at low excitation levels has also been observed using short probe pulses@xcite , and interaction effects were manifested in coherent backscattering@xcite . while simple models of incoherent radiation transport have often been used to describe light propagation through opaque media@xcite and radiation trapping in laser cooling of dense atomic samples@xcite , coherent effects arising from atom - atom interactions , which are necessary",
    "to capture correlated many - body quantum behavior induced by dipolar exchange , are beginning to play a central role .",
    "for example , the dipole - dipole interaction is responsible for the observed dipolar blockade and collective excitations in rydberg atoms@xcite ; it may also place a limit to the accuracy of an optical lattice clock and will require non - trivial lattice geometries to overcome the resulting frequency shift@xcite .",
    "previous theoretical efforts have already shown that physical conditions such as finite sample size , sample geometry , and the simultaneous presence of dispersive and radiative parts can play crucial roles in atomic emission@xcite .    in this work",
    "we use millions of sr atoms in optically thick ensembles , taking advantage of the unique level structure of sr to address motional effects , to study these radiative and dispersive parts simultaneously .",
    "we demonstrate that a single , self - consistent , microscopic theory model can provide a unifying picture for the majority of our observations .",
    "these understandings can help underpin emerging applications based on many - body quantum science , such as lattice - based optical atomic clocks@xcite , quantum nonlinear optics@xcite , quantum simulations@xcite , and atomic ensemble - based quantum memories@xcite .",
    "bosonic alkaline - earth atoms with zero nuclear spin have simple atomic structure compared to the more complex hyperfine structure present in typical alkali - metal atoms that complicates the modeling and interpretation of the experimental observations .",
    "for example , @xmath7sr atoms have both a strong @xmath8@xmath9 blue transition ( @xmath10 nm ) and a spin - forbidden weak @xmath8@xmath11 red transition ( @xmath12 nm ) , with a strict 4-level geometry ( fig .  [",
    "fig : setup](a ) ) . when the atoms are cooled to a temperature of @xmath131  @xmath14k , doppler broadening at 461",
    "nm is about 55 khz , which is almost three orders of magnitude smaller than the blue transition natural linewidth , @xmath15 = 32  mhz . to an excellent approximation",
    "atomic motion is negligible for atomic coherence prepared by the 461 nm light . to the contrary",
    ", the red transition with a natural linewidth @xmath15 = 7.5  khz is strongly affected by atomic motion . by comparing the behaviors of the same atomic ensemble observed at these two different wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) ) we can thus collect clear signatures of motional effects on coherent scattering and dipolar coupling@xcite .",
    "we use the experimental scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) to perform a comprehensive set of measurements of fluorescence intensity emitted by a dense sample of @xmath7sr atoms .",
    "the sample is released from the trap and then illuminated with a weak probe laser .",
    "we vary the atomic density , cloud geometry , observation direction , and polarization state of the laser field , and we report the system characteristics using three key parameters : the peak scattered intensity , the linewidth broadening , and the line center shift . for example , along the forward and transverse directions we observe different values of intensity and linewidth broadening , as well as their dependence on light polarization ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup](c ) ) .",
    "we also observe motional effects on the red transition in contrast to the same measurements on the blue transition .",
    "in the experiment , up to 20 million @xmath7sr atoms are cooled to @xmath131  @xmath14k in a two - stage magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , the first based on the blue transition and the second on the red transition .",
    "the atomic cloud is then released from the mot and allowed to expand for a variable time of flight ( tof ) , which allows us to control its optical depth and density .",
    "they are subsequently illuminated for 50(100 )  @xmath14s with a large size probe beam resonant with the blue ( red ) transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : forward](a ) ) .",
    "the resulting scattered light is measured with two detectors far away from the cloud ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ( a ) ) .",
    "one detector is along the forward direction @xmath16 ( detector @xmath17 ) , and the other transverse direction @xmath18 ( detector @xmath19 , offset by @xmath13@xmath20 ) . for a short tof ,",
    "the atomic cloud is anisotropic and has an approximately gaussian distribution with an aspect ratio of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are r.m.s radii .",
    "we define @xmath23 as the on resonance optical depth of the cloud , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 depends on the direction of observation with @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the transverse and forward directions respectively , @xmath28 is the atom number , and @xmath29 is the laser wavevector for the atomic transition ( see supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "the coherent effect manifests itself most clearly in the forward direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : forward ] ) . to separate the forward fluorescence from the probe beam , we focus the probe with a lens ( l@xmath30 ) after it has passed through the atomic cloud and then block it with a beam stopping blade , which can be translated perpendicular to the probe beam ( fig .",
    "[ fig : forward](a ) inset ) .",
    "the same lens ( l@xmath31 ) also collimates the atomic fluorescence so that it can be imaged onto @xmath32 .",
    "the position of the beam stopper can be used to vary the angular range of collected fluorescence , characterized by the angle ( @xmath33 ) between @xmath16 and the edge of the beam stopper ( see methods ) . using the maximum atom number available in the experiment ,",
    "the measured intensity @xmath34 is normalized to that collected at @xmath35 mrad .",
    "both the blue ( square ) and red ( triangle ) transition results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : forward](a ) . for the blue transition",
    "we observe a thousand - fold enhancement of the normalized intensity for @xmath36 0.5 mrad .",
    "we note that this enhancement as a function of @xmath33 far exceeds the diffraction effect by the beam stopper .",
    "the latter effect becomes significant only when @xmath33 @xmath37  mrad , and is also suppressed in our differential measurement scheme which compares measurements with and without atoms .",
    "the enhancement is also present for the red transition , but it is reduced by nearly two - orders of magnitude at small @xmath33 due to the motional effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the wider angular area of enhancement is attributed to the longer wavelength of the red transition .",
    "the forward intensity strongly depends on the atom number . in fig .",
    "[ fig : forward](b ) we present measurements of the forward intensity @xmath38 versus the transverse intensity @xmath39 at a fixed @xmath40 mrad for different atom numbers .",
    "the intensities are normalized to those obtained at the peak atom number as used in fig .",
    "[ fig : forward](a ) .",
    "to the first order approximation , the transverse fluorescence intensity scales linearly with the atom number .",
    "hence , the forward intensity of both the blue and red transitions scales approximately with the atom number squared .    in the forward direction",
    "we have also investigated the linewidth broadening of the blue transition as a function of the atomic @xmath23 . by scanning the probe frequency across resonance",
    "we extract the fluorescence linewidth , which is found to be determined primarily by the @xmath23 of the cloud ( open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : forward](c ) ) . for the range of @xmath41",
    "the lineshape is lorentzian ( see insets ) ; however , the observed lineshape starts to flatten at the center for @xmath23@xmath4220 .",
    "we have also varied the atom number by a factor of four , and to an excellent approximation the linewidth data is observed to collapse to the same curve when plotted as a function of @xmath23 ( open triangles ) .      for independent emitters the forward fluorescence should have no dependence on the probe beam polarization ; however , the transverse fluorescence ( along @xmath18 ) should be highly sensitive to the probe polarization , and it is even classically forbidden if the probe is @xmath18-polarized",
    ". however , multiple scattering processes with dipolar interactions can completely modify this picture by redistributing the atomic population in the three excited magnetic states and thus scrambling the polarization of the emitted fluorescence .",
    "consequently , even for a @xmath18-polarized probe there should be a finite emission along @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](c ) ) , with an intensity that increases with increasing @xmath23 .",
    "our experimental investigation of the fluorescence properties along the transverse direction is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : transverse ] . under the same @xmath23 along @xmath18 , the @xmath43-polarized probe beam ( square )",
    "gives rise to a much more broadened lineshape for the blue transition than the @xmath18-polarized probe beam does ( triangle ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transverse](a ) .",
    "meanwhile , the peak intensity ratio of @xmath44 decreases significantly with an increasing @xmath23 , indicating the rapidly rising fluorescence with a @xmath18-polarized probe when @xmath23 increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transverse](b ) ) . for the red transition ,",
    "the existence of doppler broadening requires the lineshape data to be fitted to a voigt profile . with the doppler linewidth",
    "@xmath45 fixed from the thermal velocity measured in free expansion , the voigt profile determines the line center as well as the lorentzian linewidth with the gaussian linewidth determined by the temperature .",
    "[ fig : transverse](c ) displays the lorentzian linewidth obtained with a @xmath43-polarized red probe showing a strong increase of the linewidth with @xmath23 .      to a good approximation",
    ", the dependence of the linewidth on @xmath23 along the forward and transverse directions ( for the classically allowed @xmath43 polarization in the single scattering limit ) is similar .",
    "however , due to the anisotropic aspect ratio of the cloud , for the same tof , the @xmath23 is lower along @xmath18 than along @xmath16 .",
    "this is responsible for the smaller broadenings measured along @xmath18 than along @xmath16 .",
    "the classically forbidden polarization direction , on the other hand , exhibits a different scaling with @xmath23 , which is understandable given that the emission in this case comes only from multiple scattering events with dipolar interactions .",
    "the transverse linewidth broadening for the red transition is similar to that of the blue , and it does not depend sensitively on motional effects .",
    "this behavior is in stark contrast to another important observation : the shift of the transition center frequency .",
    "[ fig : fshift ] contrasts the linecenter frequency shift observed for @xmath8@xmath9 ( square ) and @xmath8@xmath11 ( triangle , with original data reported in ref .",
    "[ ] , see supplementary fig .",
    "the blue transition frequency shift is consistent with zero at the level of 0.004@xmath15 using an atomic density of @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "however , the measured density shift for the red transition ( normalized to the transition linewidth ) is more than one order of magnitude larger . this density - related frequency shift significantly exceeds the predicted value based on general s - matrix calculations of @xmath48-wave collisions@xcite ( 2.18@xmath4910@xmath50 hz @xmath51 if the unitary limit is used ) .      before we turn to a microscopic model to obtain a full and consistent understanding of all these related experimental observations",
    ", we note that semiclassical models@xcite treating the atomic cloud as a continuous medium of an appropriate refractive index can give an intuitive explanation of the linewidth broadening in the forward direction .",
    "classically , an incoming electric field is attenuated as it propagates through the medium according to the beer  lambert law , and the forward fluorescence intensity is determined by the same mechanism .",
    "this simple semiclassical model recovers the linear dependence of the forward width for small @xmath23 , and predicts a nonlinear dependence of the linewidth for large @xmath23 and a flattening of the line center .",
    "however , we find that this semiclassical approach can not provide explanations for most aspects of the experimental observations .",
    "the full microscopic model builds on a set of coherently coupled dipoles . here , each 4-level atom is treated as a discrete radiating dipole located at a frozen position but coupled with retarded dipole radiation , and it is driven with a weak incident laser beam . the atomic ensemble follows the gaussian distribution observed in the experiment with the appropriate aspect ratio . by solving the master equation in the steady state we find that the coherence , @xmath52 $ ] , of atom @xmath53 , located at @xmath54 is modified by other atoms as@xcite : @xmath55 here , @xmath56 , @xmath57 corresponds to the three excited states of @xmath58 or @xmath59 , with @xmath60 representing the cartesian states . also , @xmath61 is the reduced density matrix of the atoms , and @xmath62 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the driving laser s linear polarization state @xmath63 is along @xmath43 or @xmath18 , with wavevector @xmath64 along @xmath16 , rabi frequency @xmath65 and detuned by @xmath66 from the @xmath67 transition .",
    "the function @xmath68 accounts for the retarded pairwise dipolar interactions and is given by@xcite @xmath69 $ ] . the fluorescence intensity @xmath70 , detected at position @xmath71 , can be determined@xcite as a function of @xmath72 , @xmath73e^{i{\\bf k}_{\\rm s}\\cdot({\\bf r}_j-{\\bf r}_m)},\\label{eq : int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 the atomic transition dipole moment , and @xmath74 .",
    "to understand the forward enhancement we first consider non - interacting atoms under the zeroth order approximation .",
    "the atomic coherence is driven only by the probe field that imprints its phase and polarization onto the atoms : @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding intensity , @xmath76 has a lorentzian profile .",
    "it also exhibits an @xmath77 scaling and an enhanced forward emission lobe , with an angular width given by the ratio between the transition wavelength and the transverse size of the sample @xmath78 .",
    "the forward lobe reflects the constructive interference of the coherently emitted radiation stimulated by the laser . outside the coherent lobe the constructive interference",
    "is quickly reduced due to the random position of atoms@xcite . the longer wavelength of the red transition corresponds to a wider angular width of the forward lobe for the red fluorescence .",
    "simple considerations can also give rise to a qualitative understanding of atomic motion - related effects on forward enhancement .",
    "again for the red transition , the doppler effect introduces random phases accumulated by @xmath79 . here , @xmath80 is the thermal velocity .",
    "the dephasing reduces coherent photon emission and gives rise to a net suppression of the forward emission intensity . the suppression becomes stronger with @xmath81 , with @xmath82 the doppler width .",
    "such a suppression is clearly observed for the red transition .    to address the linewidth broadening we now consider atoms coupled by dipolar interactions , which tend to emit collectively in an optically dense cloud .",
    "the collective emission manifests itself with a broader fluorescence linewidth . moving to the first order approximation",
    ", we note that the atomic coherence acquires contributions not only from the probe beam but also from the surrounding atoms , with @xmath83 . here , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "for a relatively dilute cloud with average inter - particle distance @xmath86 , the far - field interactions dominate , so higher order terms beyond @xmath87 can be neglected .",
    "dipolar interactions modify the fluorescence lineshape , with consequences of both a frequency shift that depends on the cloud peak density @xmath88 , and a line broadening that is proportional to @xmath23 : @xmath89 and @xmath90 , with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the first order approximation provides an intuitive picture about the role of dipolar effects on the lineshape .",
    "however , in a cloud with an increasingly large @xmath23 , dipolar interactions are stronger and multiple scattering processes become relevant .",
    "the first order perturbative analysis then breaks down@xcite .",
    "the full solution of equation  ( [ eq : eom ] ) based on the coherent coupled - dipole model becomes necessary to account for multiple scattering processes ( see methods ) .",
    "the first signatures arise from the forward fluorescence intensity , where its naive @xmath77 scaling is reduced with an increasing atom number as a consequence of multiple scattering processes .",
    "this effect is observed in both red and blue calculations , and it is expected to be more pronounced on the red transition due to its longer wavelength .",
    "however , atomic motion leads to a lower effective @xmath23 , which tends to suppress multiple scattering processes and thus helps to partially recover the collective enhancement .",
    "the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : forward](a ) and ( b ) represent such quantitative theory calculations for both transitions , which agree with experiment .",
    "meanwhile , for the linewidth broadening observed in the forward direction , it becomes evident that the scaling of the linewidth vs. @xmath23 turns nonlinear at large values of @xmath23 .",
    "the experimental data falls within the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : forward](c ) , which represents the full solution with a 20% uncertainty in the experimental atom number .",
    "multiple scattering processes are also key to the explanation of the measured fluorescence along the transverse direction , especially for the classically forbidden polarization @xmath18 . indeed , for both intensity and linewidth broadening observed in the transverse direction , under either @xmath43 or @xmath18 probe polarization",
    ", the full model ( shown as shaded areas in both fig .  [ fig : transverse](a ) and ( b ) ) reproduces well the experimental results on @xmath8@xmath9 . taking into account motional dephasing ( see supplementary note 2 ) , the transverse broadening for @xmath8@xmath11 is also well reproduced as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transverse](c ) .",
    "so far , we have shown the observed effects on linewidth and fluorescence intensity are uniquely determined by @xmath23 . however , following the arguments discussed above , the frequency shift arising from the dipolar coupling is expected to scale with atomic density , @xmath93 , which includes both the collective lamb shift and the lorentz - lorenz shift@xcite . for our experimental density",
    "this effect is @xmath94 , which is consistent with the observed frequency shift for the blue transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fshift ] ) .",
    "( note that the role of multiple scattering processes is to further suppress this frequency shift mechanism@xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for the red transition , the measured density shift ( normalized to @xmath15 ) is significantly larger than what is predicted from the current treatment of interacting dipoles ; it is also much bigger than the unitarity limit of @xmath48-wave scattering .",
    "qualitatively , we expect that as the atoms move and approach each other , the long lived ground - excited state coherence in the red transition can be significantly modified by the collisional process and open higher partial wave channels .",
    "we can thus expect a larger collisional phase shift .",
    "this process can be further complicated by atomic recoil , light forces , and doppler dephasing@xcite .",
    "we have shown that a coherent dipole model describes light scattering in a dense atomic medium with collective effects and multiple scatterings .",
    "the model captures the quantitative features of the experimental observations .",
    "motional effects , as manifested in dephasing , can be captured in the model as well .",
    "our results provide useful guides for further developments of optical atomic clocks and other applications involving dense atomic ensembles .",
    "here we present the derivation of eq .",
    "the fundamental assumption is to treat the atoms as frozen during the interrogation .",
    "this is an excellent approximation if @xmath95 is much faster than other energy scales in the problem .",
    "the latter condition is always satisfied in the case of the blue transition . for the @xmath96 to @xmath97 configuration exhibited by @xmath98sr",

    "specifically , for non - interacting two - level atoms , the atomic coherence is modified as @xmath166 for the incoherent scattering , this leads to @xmath167 while for the coherent scattering in the forward direction , one has to take into account pairwise atomic contributions , such that @xmath168 thus the on - resonance enhancement factor is @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the complementary error function .",
