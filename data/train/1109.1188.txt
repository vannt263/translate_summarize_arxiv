    "in an accompanying paper [ 1 ] , data are presented from the crystal barrel experiment on @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 at nine beam momenta from 600 to 1940 mev / c ; this corresponds to the mass range 19602410 mev .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to add these new results to earlier data on @xmath60 and do a combined partial wave analysis .",
    "data on @xmath3 were reported by eisenhandler et al . [ 2 ] and on polarisation @xmath4 by carter et al . [ 3 ] from @xmath66 to 2430 mev / c ( masses up to 2580 mev ) .",
    "further data on both @xmath3 and @xmath4 from 360 to 1550 mev / c were reported by hasan et al .",
    "the polarisation data play a vital role in the analysis , since they separate cleanly states with @xmath67 , e.g. @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these data help greatly in consolidating the analyses of @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 data and help identify resonances . the data of hasan et al .",
    "are particularly valuable , since they cover the important mass range down to 1910 mev .",
    "there have been several earlier amplitude analyses of the data on @xmath70 [ 5 - 11 ] .",
    "we find quite good agreement with these papers , though we locate additional features , noteably four @xmath71 states .",
    "the earlier analyses were restricted to the @xmath72 channel only .",
    "one of our primary objectives is to include @xmath1 and @xmath2 data , so as to examine the su(3 ) character of the fitted resonances .",
    "we also use data on @xmath73 states observed in @xmath74 [ 12 ] .",
    "they provide further constraints on the relative sign and magnitudes of @xmath75 and @xmath76 amplitudes .",
    "the analysis reported here is in terms of @xmath6-channel resonances up to @xmath77 , plus backgrounds which are needed only in the low partial waves @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this approach in terms of resonances .",
    "firstly , we find that the well known @xmath80 makes a large and unavoidable contribution .",
    "it fits to a mass and width slightly lower than averages quoted by the particle data group ( pdg ) [ 13 ] .",
    "because we need to make use of its fitted mass , we shall hereafter refer to it as @xmath81 .",
    "once this resonance is introduced , it defines phases over a considerable mass range .",
    "relative phases with other partial waves are accurately determined and it becomes impossible to avoid introducing further resonances into all other partial waves .",
    "this is not surprising , since resonances are predicted in this mass range by extrapolation from experience at lower masses . a second related point concerns the polarisation .",
    "it lies close to + 1 over much of the angular range at many momenta and inevitably requires large imaginary parts in many partial wave amplitudes .",
    "the quantity @xmath82 is proportional to the imaginary part of the interference between partial waves .",
    "differential cross sections measure the real parts of the same interferences . in order to achieve consistency between the principle of analyticity and these real and imaginary parts of interferences",
    ", we find resonance behaviour in all partial waves unavoidable .",
    "this is what was found in all earlier analyses except that of kloet and myrher [ 11 ] , which focussed on the narrow mass range below a momentum of 1 gev / c .",
    "for completeness , we repeat the standard formulae used in earlier work . the differential cross section may be expressed in terms of spin - flip ( @xmath83 ) and non - flip ( @xmath84 ) helicity amplitudes : @xmath85 here @xmath86 are legendre polynomials .",
    "partial helicity amplitude @xmath87 are defined in terms of angular momentum partial waves @xmath88 according to : @xmath89    our procedure is to express the @xmath88 as sums over resonances , up to 5 for each @xmath90 value : @xmath91 here @xmath92 are standard blatt - weisskopf centrifugal barrier factors for angular momentum @xmath93 in terms of momentum @xmath94 in the entrance channel @xmath59 and @xmath95 in the exit meson channel .",
    "explicit formulae are given by chung [ 14 ] .",
    "they guarantee the correct threshold behaviour in the @xmath59 channel .",
    "the @xmath96 are real coupling constants and @xmath97 are phases for each resonance , arising from final state interactions .",
    "we now comment in general terms on this approach .",
    "firstly , resonances overlap and interact to some degree , e.g. via common decay channels . in principle , a k - matrix approach is desirable , in order to investigate such interactions . in reality , this is impracticable at present , because of the large number of open channels , and almost complete lack of information about many of them .",
    "a practical point is that the speed of convergence of the fitting procedure is helped greatly by using as basis states the eigenstates of the scattering amplitudes ; these are t - matrix poles .",
    "we therefore view the resonances fitted to the data as a parametrisation from which further analysis can unfold the physics content .",
    "a first step is to find how many resonances are required and what their properties are .",
    "a second concern is that @xmath98-channel exchanges also undoubtedly contribute .",
    "what effect are they likely to have , if any ? in each partial wave , they lead to left - hand singularities which are very distant ; the left - hand cut opens below @xmath99 gev@xmath100 . for @xmath101 , there are further resonances lying between the mass range discussed here and the left - hand cuts",
    ". any @xmath98-channel amplitude will acquire the phase dictated by @xmath6-channel resonances in each partial wave , via rescattering within the present mass range .",
    "the effect of any @xmath98-channel exchange is therefore to introduce some slow @xmath6-dependence into the resonance width .",
    "a classic example of this is the effect of the nucleon pole on the shape of the @xmath102 resonance , first treated by the theory of chew and low [ 15 ] . in the present mass range , fitting an @xmath6-dependent width to each resonance is an impractical luxury , because there are too many unknowns .",
    "for example , form factors and the opening of new channels will distort the shape of each resonance . for simplicity , we adopt constant widths .",
    "one of our objectives is to examine the su(3 ) content of resonances .",
    "the simplest approach would be to require each resonance to have the same phase @xmath97 for all its decay channels .",
    "secondly , amplitudes for decay to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in principle related to those for @xmath72 via the quark content of the resonance , and via the well - known composition of @xmath103 and @xmath104 in terms of singlet and octet states and the pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath105 : @xmath106 and @xmath107 [ 13 ] .",
    "amplitudes for decay of @xmath7 @xmath108 combinations to @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 may then be written compactly as : @xmath109.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have introduced into the latter equation a factor @xmath110 . this factor has been fitted empirically in ref . [ 16 ] to a large variety of data on strange and non - strange final states at high energies .",
    "its value is @xmath111 and we adopt the central value of 0.85 .",
    "the resonances @xmath112 we observe in present data may be linear combinations of @xmath108 and @xmath58 : @xmath113 we use @xmath108 as a shorthand to denote @xmath114 .",
    "we expect the observed resonances to be dominantly @xmath108 in view of their production in @xmath59 reactions ; however , we would like to test this against the observed branching ratios to @xmath72 , @xmath115 and @xmath2 .",
    "amplitudes for the decay of @xmath112 to these three channels are given by the three equations : @xmath116    in our earliest attempts to fit data on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it immediately became obvious that there are major problems in applying these su(3 ) relations .",
    "the best fit we shall show later has a @xmath117 of 10585 .",
    "if one sets the phase angles @xmath97 of each resonance to the same value in all three decay channels @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and takes the resonances to be pure @xmath108 , @xmath117 increases dramatically to about 45000 .",
    "the fit is visibly awful .",
    "some deviation from strict @xmath118 is obviously required .",
    "it is necessary to introduce some latitude into phase angles @xmath97 to different channels , or into the flavour composition of the resonances , or both .    to examine where the problem lies , we have tried fitting two extreme scenarios .",
    "the first is to take all resonances to be pure @xmath108 by setting all @xmath119 to zero ; if the phases @xmath97 of all resonances are left free , @xmath120 .",
    "this is not a huge increase in @xmath117 over our best value of 10585 .",
    "however , the fit to both @xmath1 and @xmath121 angular distributions is visibly poor , particularly for @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , some of the phases @xmath97 depart from zero by unreasonably large amounts @xmath122 .",
    "so it seems that some departure from strict su(3 ) is unavoidable .",
    "the other extreme is to set all @xmath97 to zero and attempt to fit purely by adjusting flavour mixing angles @xmath119 .",
    "this turns out to be more successful , giving a @xmath117 of 11527",
    ". we shall give detailed results below .",
    "most of the mixing angles optimise in the range 020@xmath123 , i.e. close to pure @xmath108 states .",
    "these small mixing angles allow modest changes in branching ratios between @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , one resonance , @xmath53 , requires considerably larger mixing , with @xmath119 in the range 5971.6@xmath123 .",
    "the integrated cross sections shown below for @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fairly close to the values predicted by simple su(3 ) on average .",
    "the question therefore is whether it is wise to set phase angles @xmath97 strictly at zero .",
    "we now consider several considerations bearing on this point .",
    "firstly , each resonance rides on the tails of other resonances .",
    "we have had experience of fitting data at lower masses by both t - matrix techniques [ 17 ] and the k - matrix [ 18 ] . from this experience",
    ", we have learned that mixing between states commonly gives rise to deviations of phase angles @xmath97 betweeen different decay channels in the range 15 to + 15@xmath123 .",
    "even if k - matrix poles have the same phases , t - matrix poles can have different phases ; the difference depends on the separation of poles , resonances widths and the mixing through decay channels . in view of this experience ,",
    "we feel it unwise to demand strictly the same phases @xmath97 in all channels . for most resonances ,",
    "we have allowed @xmath97 to optimise freely for each decay channel with differences limited to the range 15 to + 15@xmath124 . in isolated cases , where they seem to need it , this range has been allowed to extend to @xmath125 .",
    "angles @xmath119 for flavor mixing mostly optimise naturally in the range 15 to + 15 @xmath123 .",
    "however , for large spin , it is likely that differences in centrifugal barriers and form factors between @xmath72 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 may affect branching ratios .",
    "resonances are commonly believed to have radii of 0.81.0 fm . in @xmath72",
    "decays , the wavelength of each outgoing @xmath126 is 1.1 fm for a resonance mass of 2.2 gev .",
    "overlap of wave functions will play a strong role in determining matrix elements .",
    "even quite small momentum differences between @xmath72 and @xmath1 and larger differences for @xmath2 may lead to significant departures from su(3 ) .",
    "we observe a problem in fitting @xmath1 cross sections simultaneously with @xmath54 unless some departure from strict su(3 ) is allowed .",
    "our final compromise is therefore to allow flavour mixing angles to vary in the range 0 to @xmath127 .",
    "all optimise naturally in this range , except for @xmath53 , which must be allowed complete freedom . as far as resonance masses and widths are concerned , the freedom in flavour mixing angles fortunately has little effect ; masses and widths are determined by the locations of singularities , which are independent of mixing and corresponding branching ratios .",
    "a further unknown is the radius to be given to centrifugal barriers .",
    "the masses fitted to @xmath73 states are sensitive to this radius , since the centrifugal barrier in the @xmath59 channel is strong .",
    "if the @xmath81 is to be fitted to the pdg value of 2044 mev , the radius required is unreasonably large , namely 1.5 fm .",
    "the fitted value is 0.88 fm .",
    "ratios of amplitudes for @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath128 are fitted to real constants for each resonance .",
    "since this linear combination refers to mixing within the @xmath59 channel , it is taken to be the same for decays to @xmath72 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for the @xmath81 , one expects the channel with @xmath129 to dominate over @xmath130 , because of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "this is precisely what we find .",
    "likewise , the @xmath131 state is dominantly @xmath132 .",
    "this mixing is determined very precisely by the polarisation data . for @xmath133 , we assume pure @xmath134 .",
    "the data on @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 stop at 1940 mev / c .",
    "polarisation data stop at 2200 mev / c . from @xmath135 data above 2 gev / c ,",
    "it is clear that a @xmath133 resonance is required at @xmath48 mev .",
    "a resonance close to this mass has been observed decaying to @xmath72 by the gams collaboration [ 19 ] , at 2510 mev .",
    "it seems likely that there will be further high spin resonances of similar mass .",
    "they lie so close to the top of the available mass range that we can not establish their parameters precisely . nonetheless , it is convenient to use @xmath131 , @xmath73 , and @xmath71 resonances in the range 25002620 mev to parametrise the data at the highest momenta .",
    "the tail of the @xmath133 resonance in the mass range lear below 2410 mev needs to be described accurately , since its interferences with states of lower spin are important for fitting legendre polynomials up to order 10 required by the @xmath72 and @xmath1 data .",
    "we summarise first the expected states .",
    "the @xmath81 is well known and there is plenty of evidence , summarised by the particle data group , for its radial excitation @xmath136 .",
    "there is a known @xmath137 at 2330 mev .",
    "consequently , resonances having spins with all @xmath50 below @xmath73 are expected around 2020 mev and with all @xmath50 below @xmath131 around 2300 mev . in the mass range 19102410 mev , our main focus of attention , this implies two @xmath18 @xmath108 states plus one with @xmath24 near 2300 mev , two @xmath68 and two @xmath69 states , four @xmath79 states and two @xmath138 .",
    "we are able to identify all of these except for two @xmath139 states .",
    "it is hardly surprising that it is difficult to disentangle two states of low @xmath50 .",
    "the ambiguities we have encountered concern signs of the amplitude ratios @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "these are the ratios of amplitudes after centrifugal barrier factors are factored out , i.e. they are asymptotic ratios as @xmath142 .",
    "we have located two solutions with similar @xmath117 , one with @xmath143 positive and the other with @xmath143 negative .",
    "they both contain the same resonances with similar masses and widths , and differ mostly in coupling constants .",
    "however , analysis of @xmath144 data [ 12,20 ] allows a clear distinction between these alternatives .",
    "clebsch - gordan coefficients in equns .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are such that positive @xmath143 requires dominance of @xmath145 amplitudes for @xmath136 .",
    "[ here @xmath9 is the projection of the spin of the initial state along the beam direction ; @xmath145 corresponds to @xmath146 in the helicity basis ] .",
    "this agrees with the @xmath144 analysis .",
    "negative @xmath143 is rejected strongly by that analysis .",
    "there is an argument concerning matrix elements for decay which supports this conclusion . for this high spin",
    ", the wave function of the resonance is peaked strongly at a radius of 0.81.0 fm .",
    "wave functions for the @xmath59 channel are described by spherical bessel functions .",
    "for momenta in the mass range under discussion , the first zero of @xmath147 lies outside 2 fm for both @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "overlap of wave functions with the resonance leads to the expectation that @xmath59 @xmath76 and @xmath75 will couple to the resonance with the same sign , hence @xmath143 positive .",
    "we find that the fitted amplitude ratios @xmath150 and @xmath151 are likewise positive , as one would expect from the same argument .",
    "we shall present evidence for four @xmath71 resonances at 1910 , 2020 , 2230 and 2300 mev .",
    "we shall argue for several reasons that the @xmath152 is the first @xmath108 @xmath69 state .",
    "we have examined all alternative sign combinations of @xmath153 for these four resonances .",
    "the @xmath154 polarisation data are sensitive to these signs .",
    "the best solution is obtained with signs respectively + , + , - , - in the order @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "the second best solution has signs - , - , - , - , but a @xmath157 of 13850 , i.e. worse by 3265 than the best solution .",
    "the increase in @xmath117 is mostly for polarisation data , where there is a clear systematic discrepancy between data and fit for the second alternative . for @xmath152 , @xmath153",
    "is again expected to be positive .",
    "the first zero of the bessel function @xmath158 ( coupling to @xmath68 ) again lies outside 2 fm ; so the @xmath59 momentum is low enough that the argument given above remains unchanged .    for @xmath156 , which we shall interpret as the radial excitation of @xmath152 , the momentum in the @xmath59 channel is such that the first zero of @xmath158 lies at 1.28 fm .",
    "when one allows for ( i ) the fact that the wave function will be attracted to smaller @xmath159 by the resonant interaction ( mixing in a component due to the irregular function @xmath160 ) , and ( ii ) the node in the radial wave function of the resonance , it is possible to arrive at a negative @xmath153 , as observed . for @xmath108 @xmath68 states ,",
    "it is not possible to make reliable predictions , because of the large number of nodes in the radial wave functions of the resonances .",
    "they are , however , found to show the same general variation with @xmath6 as for other @xmath50 , i.e. positive for low @xmath161 momenta and going negative for high momenta .      a solution is obtained in typically 1 - 2 minutes of computing ; consequently several thousand fits have been made , exploring the systematic effects of including or omitting various resonances .",
    "in the course of this work , we have found , from the observed variations from fit to fit , that errors on resonance masses and widths may be assigned from @xmath117 changes of @xmath162 .",
    "this is the quantitative criterion we adopt in assessing errors given here .",
    "it is larger than statistics ( @xmath163 and therefore conservative .",
    "it covers almost all of the variations which have been observed between fits with differing ingredients ; where it does not , errors have been increased to cover the observed variations .",
    "the @xmath54 data have statistical errors which are much smaller than those of other data .",
    "consequently , there is the danger that delicate features of the @xmath164 data cause problems in fitting other channels . to remedy this",
    ", we reduce the weight of the @xmath54 data by a factor 3 , and increase the weight of @xmath2 by a factor 2 .",
    "this does not introduce any major qualitative changes , but speeds convergence greatly .",
    "values of @xmath117 for all data sets are given in table 1 .",
    "they are somewhat above 1 per point , particularly for @xmath54 , because of the weighting mentioned above .",
    "it may reflect the presence of systematic errors in some data points , but also may reflect small missing components in the fit ( e.g. backgrounds from the tails of lower mass resonances ) , which can not presently be identified unambiguously .",
    "our objective is to locate the essential features of the data , and these are stable against small variants in the parametrisation of the amplitudes .",
    "[ htp ]    .contributions to @xmath117 of the fit . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a possibility is that the flavour mixing arises purely from the overlap with neighbouring @xmath58 states .",
    "the @xmath58 partner of @xmath165 could be the @xmath71 state reported by the lass group at 1950 mev [ 36 ] decaying to @xmath166 , in which case mixing with @xmath155 would be natural . on the other hand , the lass group may simply be observing the decays of @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath58 partner of @xmath155 itself is expected around 21502250 mev .",
    "it is possible to identify the states observed in @xmath167 as the @xmath58 partners of @xmath155 and @xmath152 .",
    "the @xmath71 state decaying to the @xmath167 s - wave , reported by etkin et al . [ 37 ] , also peaks at about 2150 mev ; however , their k - matrix analysis assigns it a mass of 2020 mev , because of a strong threshold effect .",
    "the jetset group have likewise reported a signal in @xmath168 peaking at @xmath169 mev , possibly the same object [ 38 ] .",
    "prokoshin has reported a peak in @xmath1 at @xmath170 mev [ 39 ] , again possibly the same resonance .",
    "recent data of the omega group on central production of @xmath171 reveals a peak at 2150 mev [ 40 ] .",
    "etkin et al .",
    "have also reported a peak in the @xmath167 d - wave at 23002340 mev .",
    "this makes a natural candidate for the @xmath69 @xmath58 partner of @xmath152 .",
    "production of the @xmath167 resonances from initial @xmath59 and @xmath172 states requires explanation .",
    "it could arise if resonances are strongly mixed between @xmath108 and @xmath58 .",
    "however , the small flavour mixing angles we observe do not point that way .",
    "a second clear possibility is that the mixing is with the @xmath71 glueball predicted in this mass range , or slightly above , by lattice qcd calculations .",
    "there is evidence from the crystal barrel data on @xmath173 for a broad @xmath71 state in @xmath1 with a mass of @xmath174 mev and a width @xmath175 mev [ 29 ] .",
    "there is similar evidence from two other sources .",
    "firstly , a broad @xmath71 contribution to the @xmath176 channel is observed in central production data at small @xmath177 [ 30 ] .",
    "its mass is @xmath178 mev with a width of @xmath179 mev . secondly , there are data from bes on @xmath180 [ 41 ] and @xmath181 [ 42 ] , which both require a broad @xmath71 signal peaking at about 2000 mev .",
    "the presence of this wide @xmath71 signal in @xmath182 radiative decays and central production data is suggestive of mixing between a glueball and neighbouring @xmath108 states to produce a broad state .",
    "we have tried inserting a broad @xmath183 with @xmath184 mev into our analysis , in addition to the four @xmath71 states discussed above .",
    "there is a modest improvement in @xmath157 of @xmath185 , but little visible change to the quality of the fits .",
    "this is not sufficient to confirm the possible presence of a broad @xmath71 background in the present data , because of the complexity of possible interferences with @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "one very striking result of the present analysis is that @xmath53 is far from being a normal @xmath108 state .",
    "its flavour mixing angle @xmath119 is @xmath186 if @xmath187 is excluded from the fit , or @xmath188 with it included .",
    "that is , it behaves predominantly as an @xmath58 state .",
    "allowing for interferences with @xmath187 , it makes up @xmath189 of the @xmath190 @xmath191 intensity and @xmath192 of that for @xmath1 .",
    "the branching ratio to @xmath2 is not well determined , because of the low statistics in this channel .",
    "our best estimate of amplitude ratios is as follows : @xmath193 for an unmixed @xmath108 state , the ratio expected between @xmath54 and @xmath1 is @xmath194 , i.e. 2.44 . the strong production of an @xmath58 state in @xmath59 annihilation is clearly anomalous .",
    "how can this be explained ?",
    "it could be a second glueball .",
    "a glueball would have a mixing angle of + 37@xmath123 .",
    "the flavour mixing angle we observe then required some mixing with a nearby @xmath58 state ; for ideal mixing , @xmath58 states are members of su(3 ) singlets , so such mixing is plausible .",
    "the latest lattice qcd calculations [ 43 ] predict a second @xmath138 glueball with a mass ratio to the first of @xmath195 . if we assign @xmath196 and @xmath53 as the two glueballs , the mass ratio is 1.40 .",
    "the alternative scenario , developed by anisovich and sarantsev [ 44 ] , is that the glueball mixes strongly with neighbouring @xmath108 and @xmath58 states to generate a broad state which contains @xmath197 of the glueball in its wave function .",
    "such a broad state may well overlap the mass range of the @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath196 , @xmath198 and @xmath53 are all seen strongly as peaks in @xmath182 radiative decay to @xmath176 [ 28 ] .",
    "this suggests that @xmath53 may be a mixed state made by mixing of the glueball with a nearby @xmath58 state .",
    "it is important to look for it in decays to @xmath199 .",
    "a combined analysis of the @xmath154 data of eisenhandler et al . and hasan et al . with crystal barrel data for @xmath54 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 leads to a secure partial wave analysis and the identification of most of the expected @xmath108 resonances in this mass range , except for two @xmath139 states .",
    "the polarisation data play a vital role in separating states with @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting fit is rather close to that obtained previously by hasan and bugg [ 9 ] .",
    "however , it is now possible to identify clearly four @xmath71 resonances .",
    "these have small flavour mixing and are probably to be identified with the @xmath108 @xmath68 and @xmath69 states expected in this mass range .",
    "the systematics of resonances on fig .",
    "10 establishes a valuable guide to masses to be expected to @xmath108 states .",
    "this should help in identifying intruder states of exotic character .",
    "the @xmath53 make a large contribution to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 data .",
    "it is not to be identified with a simple @xmath108 state , because of its + ( 5971.6)@xmath123 flavour mixing angle .",
    "this requires it to have a large @xmath58 and/or exotic component .",
