    "a topological quantum computer ( tqc ) would allow quantum information to be stored in quasiparticles and manipulated by quasiparticle braiding , in a way that is inherently robust against local perturbations ( noise ) .",
    "many of the most promising candidates for experimental implementation of a useful tqc are those which support ising anyons , e.g. , fractional quantum hall effect @xcite , majorana wires @xcite , @xmath0 superconductors @xcite and the kitaev honeycomb model ( in the presence of a magnetic field ) @xcite . while there are large differences in the underlying physics of all these systems , the non - abelian braiding statistics are such that they all possess the same computational power ( i.e. , they enable the same types of quantum gates and measurements when viewed as a quantum information processing device ) .    the model of computation ( sometimes known as the clifford computer model @xcite ) that we assume in this work , and the one that is relevant to ising anyon tqcs , is one in which @xmath1 all single - qubit clifford gates ( discussed in section [ sec : clifford operations ] ) , @xmath2 measurements in the computational basis , and @xmath3 the controlled - not gate ,",
    "are all implemented in a topologically protected ( i.e. , effectively perfect ) manner .",
    "collectively , we refer to this set of gates and measurements as stabilizer operations .",
    "some proposals for tqcs based on ising anyons use `` @xmath4-distillation '' to achieve the controlled - not @xcite , while others achieve it using quasiparticle braiding @xcite or non - demolitional measurements of the collective charge of four anyons @xcite .",
    "it is the latter , topologically protected , implementations of the controlled - not that we have in mind here .",
    "a result in quantum information theory  the gottesman - knill theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion )  says that the set of stabilizer operations is insufficient for achieving universal quantum computation .",
    "if a ( noiseless ) single - qubit unitary gate from outside the clifford group was implementable then we would immediately have full uqc ( this is the case for tqc proposals based on fibonacci anyons ) .",
    "in fact , for an ising anyon tqc , attempting to implement any non - stabilizer operation necessitates using non - topological operations which are expected to be highly noisy . for specific target gates and noise models , one can calculate the threshold noise rate @xcite before the power to provide uqc is lost ( see e.g. , section [ sec : example : phase gate subject to dephasing ] for a relevant example ) . rather than consider a number of different target gates ( unitaries ) and noise models , we examine an overall quantum operation @xmath5 , which we intend to be non - stabilizer but which may be subject to some unknown evolution , and give an operational benchmark on the utility of @xmath5 for uqc . proving that an operation , @xmath5 , enables uqc , when used alongside perfect stabilizer operations , reduces to the question of whether @xmath5 can be used to produce ancillas that are suitable for magic state distillation @xcite ( msd ) .",
    "msd is a subroutine used in many proposals for fault - tolerant uqc , whereby the requisite non - clifford gate , @xmath6 , is implemented with the assistance of a non - stabilizer pure qubit state @xmath7 .",
    "crucially , many impure ( noisy ) copies of @xmath7 can be used to create a smaller number of purer @xmath7 _ using only stabilizer operations _ , and this process can be iterated a number of times if necessary .",
    "however , if the ancillas @xmath7 are too impure then it becomes futile to attempt an approximation of @xmath6 , regardless of the number of ancillas and techniques used .",
    "a summary of the current methods and limits of msd can be found in @xcite .",
    "the benchmark ( for identifying @xmath5 that enable uqc ) that we have just described will involve the violation of a bell inequality by a two - qubit quantum state , wherein the underlying qubit encoding is provided for by non - abelian ising anyons .",
    "the topological phase supporting ising anyons is inherently nonlocal , but for the purposes of quantum information processing we are more interested in displaying the nonlocality of encoded qubits .",
    "investigations of nonlocality in non - abelian anyons have been carried out in @xcite from a different perspective .",
    "the results here are motivated mainly by ising anyon proposals for a tqc , but we note that any system in which magic state distillation is used to achieve fault - tolerant quantum computation assumes that stabilizer operations are effectively perfect ( albeit at an encoded level within a css error - correcting code , for example ) . consequently , the results presented here can be applied to any such system .    given the restriction on topologically implementable gates , and hence on measurement directions , one quickly sees ( see e.g. , section [ sec : nonlocal correlations with restricted operations ] later ) that this setup precludes the possibility of performing measurements that lead to violation of a bell inequality .",
    "in other words , all measurement outcomes can be described by a local hidden variable ( lhv ) theory , when we restrict the experimenter to using only topologically protected gates .",
    "previously , we have motivated examining the set of operations @xmath5 that can provide uqc .",
    "similarly , we can examine the set of operations @xmath5 that can enable violation of a bell inequality , when used in conjunction with topological operations .",
    "here we relate the two sets of operations with each other , and show that , under certain restrictions , one is strictly included within the other .",
    "more generally , we show that any operation that can be used to violate a so - called chsh bell inequality can also be used to provide uqc .",
    "note that violation of bell inequalities has been related to quantum computational power in other contexts @xcite , although these works were more focused on generalized entanglement and measurement - based quantum computation respectively .",
    "while an interesting topic in its own right , our results do not claim to relate nonlocality and uqc in a broad sense .",
    "indeed in the ising anyon context , if we are allowed to construct tripartite states ( e.g. , the ghz state @xmath8 ) then topologically protected operations _ are _ sufficient to exhibit tripartite nonlocality ( e.g. mermin s experiment @xcite ) , whilst still not enabling uqc .",
    "the single qubit clifford group has @xmath9 distinct elements and contains the pauli group ( of order @xmath10 ) as a subgroup ( strictly speaking we are discussing the clifford and pauli groups modulo their center , which amounts to ignoring a global phase in the matrix representation of these elements ) .",
    "canonical , non - pauli , elements of the clifford group are @xmath11[eqn : hands ] and these two operations are actually sufficient to generate the whole group .",
    "the characteristic property of clifford gates , @xmath12 , is that they map pauli operators to pauli operators under conjugation , i.e. , @xmath13 when visualized as operations on the bloch sphere , the clifford group can be identified with the @xmath9 possible transformations that can be constructed by combining consecutive @xmath14 rotations about the @xmath15-,@xmath16- and @xmath17- axes .",
    "to describe the unknown evolution of an ising anyon qubit , whilst we attempt to implement the requisite non - stabilizer operation , we use the quantum operations formalism ( as described in e.g. @xcite ) , where @xmath5 is a superoperator that maps input density matrices to output density matrices : @xmath18 a well known tool in quantum information , the jamiokowski isomorphism , tells us that @xmath5 is completely characterized by the output state , @xmath19  , of a process whereby @xmath5 is applied to one half of a maximally entangled pair @xmath20 \\quad \\text { where } \\phi=\\tfrac{\\ket{00}+\\ket{11}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\label{eqn : jamiso}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath19  is our preferred method for representing general quantum operations , we will sometimes use @xmath5 and @xmath19  interchangeably in latter sections of the paper .",
    "another convenient way of expressing a quantum operation is in terms of its so - called kraus operators , @xmath21 , via @xmath22 it takes @xmath23 real parameters to completely characterize an arbitrary completely - positive trace - preserving operation .",
    "a @xmath24-parameter subset of the set of all possible operations is given by those that preserve the identity ( these are often called unital channels ) i.e. , those for which @xmath25 . for unital operations , a kraus - like description is possible , except the operation is now a probabilistic mixture of unitaries ( where each unitary @xmath26 is applied with probability @xmath27 ) @xmath28      here we briefly motivate why a non - stabilizer operation is necessary to exhibit non - locality . consider the maximally entangled state @xmath29 , then its pauli expectation values , defined as @xmath30 are all zero except for @xmath31 the pauli expectation values for @xmath32 can be recreated exactly by two spatially separated parties * a * and * b * , given that they share @xmath33 random ( unbiased ) bits @xmath34 , and they both obey the following set of rules @xcite    1 .",
    "measurement in the @xmath35 direction @xmath36 * a * and * b * both output @xmath37 2 .",
    "measurement in the @xmath38 direction @xmath36 * a * outputs @xmath39 , * b * outputs @xmath40 3 .   measurement in the @xmath41 direction @xmath36 * a * and * b",
    "* both output @xmath42    a little thought shows that a similar scheme would work for any bipartite entangled state created by stabilizer operations . that such a scheme suffices , using only shared randomness , indicates that no purely quantum mechanical effects are needed to describe such an experiment .",
    "we will attempt to perform an experiment that , unlike the example of section [ sec : nonlocal correlations with restricted operations ] , is not describable by local hidden variables .",
    "the basic setup is depicted in figure [ fig : tikz_circuit_ising_anyons ] , where @xmath5 is applied to one half of a maximally entangled state @xmath43 and then pauli measurements are performed .",
    "we can allow for either two or three distinct pauli measurements to be performed on each qubit ( figure [ fig : tikz_circuit_ising_anyons ] depicts the scenario in which only two measurements are performed on each side ) , and these lead to different types of bell inequality .",
    "a simple set - up to detect nonlocality : here , two possible measurement settings for the first ( second ) qubit are denoted @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "when @xmath44 and @xmath45 are constrained to be pauli operators , then @xmath5 must be a non - stabilizer operation if any bell inequality ( e.g. , that given in ) is to be violated . ]    for a given bipartite state @xmath46 , and using a notation similar to that of collins and gisin @xcite , we can arrange the expectation values for a given nonlocality experiment with pauli measurements in a table i.e. , @xmath47 where xy is the expectation value @xmath48 and so on . since each pauli operator has eigenvalues @xmath49 , we can list all possible matrices of the form that correspond to deterministic local configurations .",
    "a deterministic local configuration is one in which the local pauli expectation values are extremal and , when multiplied , provide the nonlocal pauli expectation value ( e.g. , where identities like ( xi)(iy)=xy hold , with xi , iy , xy all either @xmath49 ) . by letting @xmath50",
    "take on all @xmath51 assignments , then the following matrix fully describes all possible local configurations , @xmath52 if an experimentalist s measured expectation values correspond _ exactly _ to any of the above local configurations , then these expectation values do not exhibit any nonlocality .",
    "clearly , any realistic experiment will not obey such a strict condition and the question of exhibiting nonlocality becomes richer .",
    "the experimentalist must now check that the measured expectation values can not be expressed as a probabilistic combination of local configurations .",
    "this naturally leads to the notion of convex geometry and bounded polyhedra in higher dimensions ( these are usually called polytopes ) .    ignoring the constant term in the top - left , the @xmath51 matrices in",
    "can each be identified with a vector in @xmath53 .",
    "these local configuration vectors are called vertices and the convex hull of these vertices ( i.e. the set of vectors that is expressible as a probabilistic combination of the vertices ) describes a polytope in @xmath53 ( this is analagous to how the 8 vertices @xmath54 describe a solid cube in @xmath55 ) .",
    "the interior of this polytope describes all possible lhv models .",
    "conversely , any table of expectation values that does not lie inside this polytope exhibits genuine quantum nonlocality .",
    "the usual , textbook , way of identifying nonlocality is via bell inequalities like @xmath56 in fact , ( tight ) bell inequalities such as these are actually the defining inequalities for the bounding faces ( facets ) of the lhv polytope that we have just described .",
    "software such as avis lrs @xcite can be used to derive all the facets of lhv polytope , given the @xmath51 local configuration vectors in as input ( and vice versa ) . in order to unify our notation",
    ", we rearrange the inequality and then rewrite in table form @xmath57 where the dot product between two matrices @xmath58 behaves like the familiar vector dot product i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "the full list of bounding inequalities for the lhv polytope is described in a concise form in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "in the previous section , ascertaining whether measurement results had an lhv model amounted to the question of whether the results could be expressed as a probabilistic combination of local configurations . in the context of uqc",
    ", the relevant question is now whether @xmath5 is expressible as a probabilistic combination of clifford gates ; for example , an operation @xmath5 given by @xmath60 is clearly of no use in the quest to achieve uqc .",
    "the general prerequisite for @xmath5 to be useful is @xmath61 if we use the jamiokowski isomorphism ( as defined in ) to represent operations , then a completely equivalent condition to is given by @xmath62 to test whether an unknown operation satisfies the above requirement , one is naturally lead to the concept of convex polytopes once more .",
    "the @xmath9 clifford gates , when represented as @xmath63 and decomposed in the pauli basis , form the @xmath9 vertices of what is called the clifford polytope .",
    "in fact , the clifford operations only span a 9-dimensional subspace of @xmath53 because the six coefficients ix , iy , iz , xi , yi and zi are all identically zero when @xmath64 .",
    "the clifford gates given in , for example , correspond to the following two vertices @xmath65    the facets of the clifford polytope @xcite are bounding inequalities that partition the set of all valid @xmath19  into those that represent @xmath5 satisfying and those that do not .",
    "in other words , any operation @xmath5 that satisfies violates ( at least ) one of these facet inequalities .",
    "these inequalities , which we label @xmath66 , can be cast in matrix form , in a completely equivalent way to what was done in , and it turns out there are two distinct classes of facet @xcite  a representative example of each of which we provide below .",
    "@xmath67 the total number of facets , required to completely characterize the boundary of the clifford polytope , is @xmath68 , which can be broken down into @xmath69 .",
    "we are primarily interested in facets from @xmath70 because it was shown in @xcite that an operation violating such a facet can always be used to create an ancilla @xmath71 that is useful for magic state distillation . the circuit to create @xmath71",
    "is given in figure [ fig : rho_from_op ] , where the choice of which two - qubit pauli measurement @xmath72 to perform is determined by the particular facet that is violated by @xmath5 .     a circuit to help achieve universal quantum computation via magic state distillation : every element of this circuit except @xmath5 is implementable using stabilizer operations .",
    "when @xmath5 exhibits nonlocality in the setup of figure [ fig : tikz_circuit_ising_anyons ] , then @xmath5 used in the above circuit produces ancillas @xmath71 that are useful for magic state distillation subroutine ( msd circuit not depicted ) .",
    "the block containing @xmath72 stands for a two - qubit pauli measurement ( e.g.  parity measurement ) wherein we postselect on the desired outcome . ]",
    "a full facet description of the lhv polytope as described in section [ sec : bell inequalities ] comprises 684 distinct facets , and this facet description can partitioned into 3 different classes i.e , @xmath73 the number of distinct facets in each class is @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "inequalities of the type @xmath77 are considered trivial , since the restrictions they impose are satisfied by any bipartite quantum state @xmath46 .",
    "the representative inequality @xmath77 given in amounts to @xmath78\\geq 0}$ ] , for example .",
    "inequalities of the type @xmath79 are usually known as clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequalities @xcite and an example of one such inequality was already discussed in the context of equation .",
    "these @xmath79 inequalities appear , in a different form closer to that of , in most textbook accounts of nonlocality ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "bell inequalities of the type @xmath80 are less well known but have a long history , appearing as early as 1981 @xcite and rediscovered more recently in @xcite . finally we note the reasoning behind the notation @xmath81 ; the numbers @xmath82 in the subscript refer to the number of measurement settings , @xmath83 , available to each party , wherein each measurement has a number , @xmath84 , of possible outcomes ( e.g. , inequalities of the type @xmath80 can only arise when there are @xmath33 possible measurement settings on each side of the bipartite state ) .",
    "the @xmath79 inequalities require only two pauli measurements on each side whereas @xmath80 inequalities require three on each side .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath79 inequalities are sufficient for our purposes .",
    "in fact , @xmath80 inequalities are irrelevant ( redundant ) for a very large subset of all possible quantum operations @xmath5 . if one makes the assumption that @xmath64 , which is the case for many of the most important noise models , then local expectation values for @xmath46 are identically zero , and coefficients of ix , iy , iz , xi , yi and zi in @xmath80 facets can be ignored . with this modification ,",
    "the @xmath80 inequalities are expressible as linear combinations of @xmath79 ( chsh ) inequalities , and hence the @xmath80 inequalities are irrelevant .",
    "one can check that all ( purely nonlocal ) @xmath80 inequalities decompose into four @xmath79 inequalities , as in the following example @xmath85 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are now ready to state the main result :    [ thm : theorem1 ] if there is an operation @xmath5 violating a facet from @xmath86 ( i.e. , violating a chsh inequality ) , then @xmath5 also violates a facet ( of the clifford polytope ) from @xmath87 . using results from @xcite , such @xmath5 enable uqc ( via magic state distillation ) when supplemented with topologically protected operations .",
    "mathematically , we have the following statement @xmath88 without loss of generality , we assume that the canonical representative , @xmath79 , of @xmath86 is violated , and show that @xmath89 from @xmath87 is necessarily also violated .",
    "this is a consequence of the following proposition , which is easily proved @xmath90 rearranging the above inequality gives @xmath91 which simply stands for @xmath92 this is always satisfied since pauli expectation values are in the range @xmath93 $ ] . to create an ancilla for magic state distillation ( and",
    "consequently enable uqc ) , the best measurement @xmath72 to use in the circuit of figure [ fig : rho_from_op ] is the parity measurement postselcted on even parity i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "note that @xmath95 .",
    "examining the matrix representation of these sets of facets , one sees that each @xmath96 can be paired one - to - one with each @xmath97 , by matching facets whose non - identity coefficients differ in only one position ( e.g. , the coefficient of zz in our canonical @xmath79 is @xmath98 , whereas for our canonical @xmath99 the coefficient is @xmath100 ) .",
    "this provides a recipe for identifying the relevant @xmath99 such that holds , for a given @xmath79 ( the chsh inequality that we presume has been violated ) .",
    "any such pair @xmath101 will obey an inequality of the form .",
    "the general expression , analagous to , for different facets from @xmath86 and suitably chosen facets from @xmath70 is @xmath102 and this clearly always holds . in order to use @xmath5 to obtain ancillas useful for magic state distillation , a suitable measurement @xmath72 in figure [ fig : rho_from_op ]",
    "includes one of the form @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the phase gate , @xmath104 , defined as @xmath105 is an element of the clifford group when @xmath106 is a multiple of @xmath107 .",
    "whilst technically any non - clifford angle @xmath106 would suffice to enable uqc , one typically seeks to implement the so called `` pi - over - eight '' gate @xmath108 because it possesses additional desirable properties @xcite . for the case of ising anyons",
    ", it has been proposed @xcite to perform a phase gate using a sack - like geometry , wherein the sack contains a single qubit , and an anyonic edge current can either follow the exterior boundary of the sack or tunnel across the constriction of the sack . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , subject to certain assumptions , the overall evolution of the qubit state can be described by a superoperator @xmath109 where the matrix elements of the density operator change like @xmath110 or , equivalently in the kraus operator form , @xmath111 as a side note ; in quantum information theory , the description of this process in terms of kraus operators would probably be rewritten @xmath112 which is completely equivalent .",
    "the natural interpretation is that with probability @xmath113 the desired @xmath104 gate is performed , and with probability @xmath114 an undesired rotation @xmath115 is performed .",
    "this undesired rotation is actually the worst possible noise that could be inflicted @xcite ( i.e. , it requires the smallest noise rate , @xmath114 , to make the overall @xmath5 expressible as a probabilistic combination of clifford gates ) .",
    "the operation , @xmath5 , of , when expressed as a jamiokowski state , @xmath19  , and decomposed in the pauli basis , takes the form @xmath116 & e^{-\\frac{s^2}{2 } } \\text{sin}[\\theta ] & 0 \\\\   0 & e^{-\\frac{s^2}{2 } } \\text{sin}[\\theta ] & -e^{-\\frac{s^2}{2 } } \\text{cos}[\\theta ] & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ) \\label{eqn : dephasinginpb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so the bell inequality given in reads @xmath117 + [ \\sin \\theta ] + [ \\sin \\theta ] - [ -\\cos \\theta ] \\right)\\leq 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the optimal choice of angle , @xmath118 , this inequality is violated for the parameter range @xmath119 . in terms of the simplified kraus operators given in the range of allowable noise rates @xmath114 , while still giving chsh violation",
    "is given by @xmath120 .",
    "another simple calculation shows that the facet @xmath99 is also violated ( hence uqc is possible ) for the same noise rates @xmath120 .",
    "one can actually see this straight away by noting that implies that @xmath121zz@xmath122 , which means ( with reference to ) that the threshold noise rate is the same for violation of @xmath99 and @xmath79 .",
    "this will also be true for any noise model that is expressible as a probabilistic combination of rotations about the @xmath17-axis ( and similarly for operations comprised of rotations about @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes too ) .",
    "the noise rates for which bell inequality violation is possible , and the noise rates for which uqc is possible , generally do not coincide .",
    "for example , a @xmath108 gate under depolarizing noise , modeled as @xmath123 enables uqc , but does not violate any bell inequality , for the parameter range @xmath124 .",
    "in the current context , a non - clifford operation @xmath5 is necessary if one hopes to observe nonlocality ( as shown in section [ sec : nonlocal correlations with restricted operations ] ) , but not always sufficient .",
    "however , if we expand the problem to allow multiple ( possibly simultaneous ) uses of @xmath5 , in a more complex circuit than that of figure [ fig : tikz_circuit_ising_anyons ] , then it is an interesting question whether @xmath5 being non - clifford could be both a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of a bipartite bell inequality .",
    "by using techniques from convex geometry , we can show that detection of nonlocality in the encoded qubits of an ising anyon tqc serves as a benchmark for universal quantum computation .",
    "the strength of this approach is that it does not consider specific noise models , but rather considers general quantum operations . given an unknown operation that has been observed to enable violation of a chsh inequality ( using two distinct pauli measurements on each half of an entangled state ) , we can prescribe a way of using this operation to manufacture ancillas that are suitable for magic state distillation . when used in conjunction with topologically protected stabilizer operations , ancillas of this kind allow for universal quantum computation .",

    "<S> an obstacle affecting any proposal for a topological quantum computer based on ising anyons is that quasiparticle braiding can only implement a finite ( non - universal ) set of quantum operations . </S>",
    "<S> the computational power of this restricted set of operations ( often called stabilizer operations ) has been studied in quantum information theory , and it is known that no quantum - computational advantage can be obtained without the help of an additional non - stabilizer operation . similarly , </S>",
    "<S> a bipartite two - qubit system based on ising anyons can not exhibit non - locality ( in the sense of violating a bell inequality ) when only topologically protected stabilizer operations are performed . to produce correlations that can not be described by a local hidden variable model again </S>",
    "<S> requires the use of a non - stabilizer operation . using geometric techniques , we relate the sets of operations that enable universal quantum computing ( uqc ) with those that enable violation of a bell inequality . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the fact that non - stabilizer operations are expected to be highly imperfect , our aim is to provide a benchmark for identifying uqc - enabling operations that is both experimentally practical and conceptually simple . </S>",
    "<S> we show that any ( noisy ) single - qubit non - stabilizer operation that , together with perfect stabilizer operations , enables violation of the simplest two - qubit bell inequality can also be used to enable uqc . </S>",
    "<S> this benchmarking requires finding the expectation values of two distinct pauli measurements on each qubit of a bipartite system . </S>"
