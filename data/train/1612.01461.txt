    "transport properties of massless dirac fermions in graphene display many interesting behaviors such as anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite , chiral tunneling @xcite , klein paradox @xcite and so on @xcite .",
    "furthermore , graphene acquires both ferromagnetic and superconducting features by means of proximity @xcite .",
    "these effects open a new opportunity for designing devices which are based on hybrid structures of superconductors . since the graphene - based junctions are assumed as mesoscopic systems , one can employed the landauer formalism to describe the transport properties of them in ballistic regime . extending this formalism leads to blonder - thinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) approach @xcite for describing quantum transports of the system .",
    "the thermoelectric power or seebeck coefficient and thermal current of graphene based junctions have been topics of intense research in few years @xcite .",
    "because of some experimental limitations in nano - scale devices on 2d materials , the charge and spin - dependent seebeck effects are often ignored in the previous studies @xcite",
    ". recently , developing in the low - temperature measurement devices provide suitable condition for experimental observation in the field of thermal transport .",
    "more recently , theoretical and experimental investigations were done on the thermoelectric features of graphene by zuev et al .",

    "in fact , we need electron - hole asymmetry at fermi level to reach higher efficiency in thermoelectric power @xcite . in graphene - based devices , chemical potential can be tuned close to the band edges which provide conditions to create asymmetry in density of states ( doss ) . applying spin - splitting field @xmath1",
    "can also break the symmetry for each spin directions . in spin - splitting systems ,",
    "the spin - polarized current can be generated by applying a temperature gradient .",
    "usually , the combination of spin - orbit interactions ( soi ) and a uniform zeeman field create a useful mechanism to manipulate the quasi - particles transport which lead to very interesting phenomena in the field of spintronics @xcite .",
    "it is well known that soi can be divided into two categories named rashba spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi ) which is due to the structure inversion symmetry and dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction ( dsoi ) which is the results of the bulk inversion symmetry @xcite .",
    "it was experimentally demonstrated that a graphene nano - sheet can support strong rsoi about 17 mev by proximity @xcite while the strength of the dsoi is very small approximately between 0.0011 and 0.05 mev @xcite . to demonstrate the existence of proximity - induced rsoi in the graphene layer , a dc voltage along the graphene layer is measured by spin to charge current conversion which is interpreted as the inverse rashba - edelstein effect .",
    "this property can be employed as a means to control the spin - transport in the graphene - based spintronic devices .",
    "in addition to the above , spin - caloritronics which is a combination of thermoelectric and spintronic effects has attracted more attention due to very promising applications @xcite . in a non - magnetic material like graphene , generating the spin - dependent seebeck effect which can produce an spin current with ability to convert into a measurable voltage is a very important issue .",
    "this spin -dependent seebeck effect has been previously reported for metallic , semiconductor and even insulator materials @xcite .",
    "the heating power applied to the system can easily change the accumulation of majority and minority spins and switch the sign of spin - dependent seebeck coefficient with reversing the temperature differential .",
    "the results revealed a large number of possible applications in designing thermo - spintronic devices and increasing their efficiency @xcite . considering this fact that graphene has tunable electronic properties with strong energy - dependence of the conductivity along with very weak spin relaxation made it promising candidate in spin - thermoelectrics in comparison with other magnetic materials .",
    "herein , we consider two different setups of graphene - based junctions which have a potential for developing superconducting devices with interesting thermoelectric abilities under various condition of temperature , magnetic exchange field , chemical potential and spin - orbit interaction . we theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties of ferromagnetic - superconductor ( f - s ) and ferromagnetic - rashba spin - orbit region - superconductor ( f - rso - s ) junctions made of graphene .",
    "results demonstrate that the simultaneous effect of spin - splitting field and spin - orbit coupling lead to a strong suppression of the spin imbalances which can affect on the usually small thermoelectric coefficients in superconducting heterostructures . also , the calculated spin seebeck coefficient can easily tunned both through applied magnetic exchange field and chemical potential .",

    "furthermore , in graphene , the rashba spin - orbit coupling is in the order of @xmath135 17 mev and the typical superconducting gap is about @xmath136 mev .",
    "so , in the theoretical point of view , we can easily increasing the rso parameter ( @xmath107 ) up to 15 times greater than the value of @xmath74 and the results can be experimentally reliable .",

    "<S> using the bogoliubov de - gennes formalism , we investigate the charge and spin - dependent thermoelectric effects in superconductor graphene junctions . </S>",
    "<S> results demonstrate that despite normal - superconductor junctions , there is a temperature dependent spin thermopower both in the graphene - based ferromagnetic - superconductor ( f - s ) and ferromagnetic - rashba spin - orbit region - superconductor ( f - rso - s ) junctions . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction , the charge and spin - dependent seebeck coefficients can reach to their maximum up to 3.5@xmath0 and 2.5@xmath0 , respectively . remarkably , these coefficients have a zero - point critical value with respect to magnetic exchange field and chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> this effect disappears when the rashba coupling is absent . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that graphene - based superconductors can be used in spin - caloritronics devices . </S>"
