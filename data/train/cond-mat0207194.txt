    "the k - satisfiability ( ksat ) problem deals with an ensemble of @xmath0 boolean variables , submitted to @xmath1 constraints .",
    "each constraint is in the form of an or function of @xmath2 variables in the ensemble ( or their negations ) , and the problem is to know whether there exists one configuration of the variables ( among the @xmath3 possible ones ) which satisfies all constraints .",
    "the ksat problem for @xmath4 is a central problem in combinatorial optimization : it was the first problem to be shown np - complete  @xcite , and an efficient algorithm for solving ksat in its worst case instances would immediately lead to other algorithms for solving efficiently thousands of different hard combinatorial problems .    at the core of the statistical physics of disordered systems",
    "is the spin glass problem ( sg ) , which also deals with boolean variables ( spins ) , interacting with random exchange couplings @xcite .",
    "each pair of interacting spins can be seen as a constraint , and finding the state of minimal energy in a spin glass amounts to minimizing the number of violated constraints .",
    "although the precise form of the constraints in sg and ksat differ , there exist deep similarities@xcite ; in both cases the difficulty comes from the existence of frustration@xcite , which forbids to find the global optimal state by a purely local optimization procedure .",
    "links between combinatorial optimization and statistical physics have been known for long@xcite .",
    "two main categories of questions can be addressed .",
    "one type is algorithmic , for instance finding an algorithm which decides whether an instance is sat or unsat .",
    "another is more theoretical , and deals with large random instances , for which one wants to predict the typical behaviour .",
    "examples of use of statistical physics in each category are the simulated annealing algorithm @xcite and the solution of the random assignment problem @xcite , or the direct mapping of certain graph partitioning problems to spin glasses @xcite . here",
    "we address the two types of questions in the 3sat problem .",
    "the study of random ksat problems , where the clauses are chosen randomly , is also interesting from the viewpoint of optimization . in practice ,",
    "algorithms which are used to solve real - world np - complete problems display a huge variability of running times , ranging from linear to exponential , when the parameters ( e.g. the number of clauses ) are changed .",
    "a theory for the typical - case behaviour of algorithms , on classes of random instances chosen from a given probability distribution , is therefore the natural complement to the worst - case analysis  @xcite .    in random 3sat",
    ", numerical simulations have shown the existence of a phase transition when one varies the ratio @xmath5 of the number of clauses to the number of variables .",
    "for @xmath6 the generic problem is satisfiable ( sat ) , for @xmath7 the generic problem is not satisfiable ( unsat)@xcite . using the cavity method , first developed in spin glass theory , we shall show the existence of this threshold and compute @xmath8 .",
    "we also find an intermediate region , the hard - sat - phase @xmath9 , where the generic problem is still sat but the proliferation of metastable states makes it difficult for algorithms to find a solution .",
    "this proliferation is similar to the effect found in the theories of structural glasses using spin glass models with multispin interactions @xcite , where it is known to lead to a dramatic slowdown of the relaxation . in this sense",
    "the difficulty to solve the 3sat problem in the intermediate region @xmath10 is similar to the difficulty in equilibrating structural glasses .",
    "this theoretical analysis is done using the cavity method , at a level equivalent to what is called one step replica symmetry breaking in the replica language .",
    "this means that it assumes the existence of many states , but can not handle a nontrivial correlation pattern between them .",
    "there are some arguments which point towards the correcteness of this solution , although an exact proof looks somewhat remote at present .    in this cavity method with many states , the order parameter consists in the surveys of local magnetic fields acting on each spin . while for the theoretical analysis one averages over the random graph structure of the problem , it turns out that this order parameter can also be computed for one given sample , using a reasonably simple message passing procedure which takes into account the multiplicity of states .",
    "this procedure provides a generalization of the belief propagation used in statistical inference @xcite ; it is shown here to converge in some difficult situation with many equilibrium states where ordinary belief propagation does not converge .",
    "the resulting surveys provide an interesting description of one given sample , where the various variables are found to play very different roles .",
    "this single sample analysis is very useful in order to find new algorithms for solving hard optimization problems .",
    "here we show one such algorithm for the random 3sat problem , where the surveys are used to identify one spin and fix it .",
    "the problem is thus reduced and the surveys are computed again on the new system .",
    "this decimation procedure is shown to have very good performances , comparable to , or better than , the state of the art in this problem .",
    "the paper presents a number of concepts and techniques , both analytical and numerical , which can be applied to a rather large class of combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "we have presented these concepts and techniques in a broad framework , in order to allow for future use on different problems .",
    "the concrete implementation is then done on the random 3sat problem .",
    "some of the results discussed in this paper have been recently announced in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect_fact_graph ] we present the generic structure of the optimization problems in which we are interested .",
    "these can be represented as bipartite graphs called factor graphs .",
    "[ sect_sum_prod ] recalls a general message passing procedure which can be used to study optimization or inference problems defined on these factor graphs .",
    "the basic ingredients of this procedure are messages which we call cavity - biases which play a crucial role in the whole paper .",
    "[ sect_rangraph ] defines the set of random graphs which we study , which are random hypergraphs with a fixed connectivity .",
    "[ sect_states ] provides some background on the decomposition of the configuration space into states .",
    "it consists of a short introduction for non - physicists , a specific definition of zero temperature states for the random 3sat problem , and the definition of the _ complexity _ which is a crucial concept for a system with many states .",
    "[ sect_cavity ] provides an introduction to the zero temperature cavity method , presented in the general setting of combinatorial problem on random factor graphs .",
    "this section summarizes , and puts in a more general context , some recent work which has developed the cavity method for finite connectivity problems , first at finite temperature @xcite , then at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "it provides the whole formalism for the analytic study of the phase diagram .",
    "this formalism is applied to the random 3sat problem in sect .",
    "[ sect_r3sat ] , where all the results on the phase diagram are derived .",
    "we explain the survey propagation algorithm on a given sample in sect .",
    "[ sect_sp ] , and the decimation algorithm for solving large random 3sat problems is presented in [ sect_sid ] .",
    "[ sect_concl ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "appendix a contains some technical details relative to the computation of the phase diagram done in sect.[sect_r3sat ] .",
    "appendix b explains the computation of the free energy for one given sample .",
    "the models we are interested in involve boolean variables which interact in groups , the energy being the sum of energies of all groups .",
    "we shall adopt the factor graph representation  @xcite familiar in computer science , but we shall keep to the representation of boolean variables as ising spins , more familiar to statistical physicists .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 ising spins , @xmath11 , and we suppose that we have @xmath1 groups of interacting variables , which are called function nodes .",
    "each function node @xmath12 involves a set of @xmath13 spins .",
    "we denote by @xmath14 the set of all these spins .",
    "the interaction is an arbitrary function of the spins in @xmath14 , which depends on the problem one considers , and can also involve hidden variables .    the total energy of a configuration @xmath15 is @xmath16 and the goal in combinatorial optimization is to find a configuration of spins which minimizes @xmath17 . a generalization of this problem , natural from the point of view of physics , and which connects with problems in statistical inference , consists in introducing an additional parameter @xmath18 , an inverse temperature in the physics language , and in studying the boltzmann probability distribution : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a normalisation constant . as usual in physics",
    ", we shall denote by @xmath21 the expectation of an observable @xmath22 ( which can be any function of the @xmath23 ) with respect to this measure . in the large @xmath18",
    "( low temperature ) limit this measure concentrates onto the lowest energy configurations . at finite @xmath18",
    "one may be interested in computing for instance the expectation value of one spin variable @xmath24 with the boltzmann probability . because we work with binary spins , this average determines the full marginal probability law of @xmath24 :",
    "this is precisely the quantity that one typically seeks in many inference problems , like e.g. decoding procedures for error correcting codes .",
    "the general problem can be represented by a graph consisting of two types of vertices , variable nodes associated with each spin , and function nodes. a function node @xmath12 is connected by edges to all the variable nodes involved in @xmath25 .",
    "therefore each variable node has connections towards all the function nodes in which it appears , and the graph is bipartite ( see fig.[fig_graph ] ) .",
    "each spin @xmath23 is connected to @xmath26 function nodes , we denote this set of function nodes by @xmath27 .",
    "we call @xmath26 the connectivity of spin @xmath28 , @xmath13 the connectivity of function node @xmath12 . throughout this paper ,",
    "the variable nodes indices are taken in @xmath29 , while the function nodes indices are taken in @xmath30     variable nodes @xmath31 and @xmath32 function nodes @xmath33 . in this case , each function node has connectivity @xmath32 , as in the 3sat problem .",
    "the connectivities of the @xmath34 variable nodes are respectively @xmath35 . ]",
    "let us give here a few standard examples .",
    "spin glasses : all the interactions involve two spins , so all @xmath13 are equal to @xmath36 ; the energy of an interaction node @xmath12 involving spins @xmath23 and @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where the number @xmath39 is called the coupling constant . generalized spin glasses with p - spin interactions , @xmath40 have also been studied a lot in statistical physics as models of structural glasses .",
    "they are the closest physical analogues of the satisfiability problems which we study here @xcite .",
    "k - sat : all interactions involve @xmath2 spins , and the energy of an interaction node @xmath12 involving spins @xmath41 is given by : @xmath42 it depends on a set of @xmath2 coupling constants @xmath43 which take values @xmath44 .",
    "this interaction node has a simple interpretation as a clause : the energy @xmath45 is zero as soon as at least one of the spins @xmath46 is opposite to the corresponding coupling @xmath47 .",
    "if all spins are equal to their couplings , the energy is equal to @xmath36 .",
    "the more conventional description of ksat uses boolean variables : let us introduce @xmath48 which is true if and only if @xmath49 . the energy @xmath45 depends on the or of the @xmath2 variables @xmath50, ...",
    "@xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the original @xmath53 when @xmath54 and is its negation when @xmath55 .",
    "the energy vanishes if @xmath56 is true ( the clause is then said to be satisfied ) , otherwise it is equal to @xmath36 and the clause is unsatisfied .",
    "this arbitrary factor of @xmath36 is introduced for future convenience .",
    "one can also consider graphs involving mixtures of function nodes of different types , e.g. mixtures of @xmath57 clauses and @xmath58 clauses @xcite .",
    "these are some examples of constraints satisfaction problems , but of course there exist many other instances of problems , much studied in computer science , which can be represented by such factor graphs .",
    "in general , an instance of the problem ( also called a sample in physics language ) is given by a graph and the set of couplings needed to define each function node . in physics ( e.g. spin glasses ) one is interested in the configurations of low energy . in the sat problem ,",
    "one wants to know whether there exists a configuration of zero energy ( in which case the instance is called sat ) , or not ( in which case the instance is unsat ) .",
    "a popular method for studying the inference , i.e. the probability measure ( [ boltz ] ) , is a message passing procedure called the `` sum - product '' algorithm@xcite . when used at @xmath59 , the corresponding `` min - sum '' algorithm can also be used to get some information on the lowest energy configurations .",
    "this procedure is exact and fast on tree - like graphs . in our case",
    "the sum - product algorithm amounts to sending some messages along the edges of the graph .",
    "we call cavity - field , and denote by @xmath60 , the message passed from a variable node @xmath28 to a function node @xmath12",
    ". we call cavity - bias , and denote by @xmath61 , the message passed from a function node @xmath12 to a variable node @xmath28 .",
    "the cavity - field @xmath60 is given by the sum of cavity - biases converging to @xmath28 from all function nodes @xmath62 distinct from @xmath12 : @xmath63    the operation performed by a function node to compute the cavity - biases which it will send to its neighboring variable nodes is a partial summation : it computes the marginal probability law for that variable to which it sends the message .",
    "more precisely , let us consider a function node @xmath12 of connectivity @xmath2 and let us suppose , for notational simplicity , that it is connected to variables @xmath64 .",
    "the cavity - bias @xmath65 sent from the function node @xmath12 to the variable node @xmath66 is a function of the cavity - fields @xmath67 sent from all other variables nodes @xmath68 towards node @xmath12 .",
    "one considers the function of @xmath24defined by @xmath69 . as @xmath70 , this function",
    "can be written for instance as the exponential of a linear form in @xmath24 .",
    "the cavity - bias @xmath71 sent from @xmath12 to @xmath72 is defined from : @xmath73 beside the cavity - bias @xmath71 , this equation also defines a free - energy shift @xmath74 which is not used in the sum - product algorithm but will become very important in our generalisation later on . in physics words",
    ", @xmath60 is the magnetic field on spin number @xmath28 whenever the interaction @xmath12 is turned off , and @xmath75 is the contribution to the magnetic field on spin number @xmath28 from the interaction @xmath12 . equation ( [ sum_u ] ) indicates that the probability law of spin @xmath23 due to the interactions @xmath76 is a product of independent laws due to each interaction , while the marginalization operation ( [ uwdef ] ) is a partial summation , hence the name sum - product . the algorithm is easily generalized to variables which are more complicated than boolean .",
    "the iteration of the above message passing algorithm , starting from a generic random initial condition , is known to converge whenever the underlying factor graph is a tree .",
    "actually it converges in one sweep if one first computes the messages from the leaves of the tree .",
    "the resulting set of messages can be used to compute the probability distribution of one spin ( or more generally of some subset of spins ) .",
    "one just needs to compute the local field @xmath77 on spin @xmath23 : @xmath78 and the probability distribution of @xmath23 is : @xmath79 one way to prove this result , using the physics language , is to show that the message passing algorithm minimizes the bethe free energy of the spin system @xcite . as the bethe free energy is exact for tree like graphs , this provides the proof . if one is interested in the optimization problem ( @xmath80 ) , one can show that the configuration @xmath81 is the lowest energy configuration if there is a unique such configuration .",
    "if there are several lowest energy configurations , taking the @xmath59 limit of @xmath82 with the measure ( [ local_meas ] ) gives the average of the spin @xmath23 over all these configurations ( but one needs to make this detour through the finite @xmath18 problem in order to get this result ) .    in this work",
    "we shall mainly be interested in the optimization problem .",
    "working directly at @xmath83 then simplifies the algorithm .",
    "the cavity - fields are generated as before by sums of cavity - biases . for computing a cavity - bias ,",
    "one performs a partial minimization , and the formula ( [ uwdef ] ) simplifies to @xmath84 = - \\left(w_{a \\to 1}+\\sigma _ { 1 } u_{a \\to 1}\\right ) \\ . \\label{uwdef2}\\ ] ] this equation defines the output messages @xmath85 and @xmath86 as functions of the input messages @xmath87 . in general , we shall write @xmath88 which defines the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( the label @xmath91 is here to explicitly remind that a given function node energy @xmath45 will in general depend on some set of couplings - see ( [ epsdefpspin],[epsdefksat])- which we denote collectively as @xmath91 ) .",
    "in the rest of this paper we shall consider the random k - sat problem , which is defined on some ensemble of random graphs which we now describe . to lighten the notation , we concentrate on the @xmath58 cases for which all the function nodes have connectivity @xmath92 , and we generate the random graphs as follows : for each triplet @xmath93 of variable nodes , a function node connecting them is present with a probability @xmath94 , and it is absent with probability @xmath95 .",
    "the average number of function nodes is then @xmath96 . the graph model",
    "used is analogous to the g(n , p ) model of random graph theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , with @xmath97 .    for the problem which we consider",
    ", the energy @xmath45 associated with a function node @xmath12 also depends on some coupling constants @xmath91 ( see for instance ( [ epsdefksat ] ) ) , which may be drawn randomly and independently for each function node from some probability distribution .",
    "for instance in random 3sat , each number @xmath98 takes values @xmath44 with probability @xmath99 . in general",
    "we shall denote by @xmath100 the average of any quantity @xmath22 over all the choices of the random graphs ( with fixed @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and over the choices of couplings .",
    "in such a probabilistic setting , one is interested for instance in computing the average ground state energy : for each sample , an optimal configuration ( one with minimal energy ) , is called the ground state , its energy is @xmath101 , and one would like to compute @xmath102",
    ".      we shall be interested in the _thermodynamic limit_ where @xmath1 and @xmath0 go to @xmath103 , keeping the ratio @xmath5 fixed .",
    "the connectivities of variable nodes become independent identically distributed ( iid ) random variables with a poisson distribution @xmath104 of mean @xmath105 , since the probability of having @xmath106 edges connected to a variable node is : @xmath107    the structure of the random graphs generated by this process for large @xmath0 is interesting . locally",
    "such a graph is tree - like : the typical size of a loop in the graph scales like @xmath108 for large @xmath0 . on the other hand loops are definitely present , and they can induce frustration in the sense of having competing constraints ( it has been argued that similar random graphs with a local tree - like structure provide a natural setting for discussing the bethe approximation of frustrated systems @xcite ) .",
    "the structure of the graph has one important consequence : consider one given function node , connected to three variable nodes ( spins ) .",
    "if one deletes this function node , the typical distance between any two of these three spins ( measured as the length of the shortest path on the graph which connects them ) is of order @xmath109 , and thus diverges in the thermodynamic limit : the spins are far apart .",
    "this property will be crucial in understanding the type of correlations existing between the spins , and in solving the model .",
    "notice that the limit where @xmath110 is also the one that is interesting from a computational complexity point of view .    for problems defined on random graphs with given @xmath111 ,",
    "the ground state energy fluctuates from sample to sample .",
    "it is often true , but it may be difficult to show , that the distribution of the ground state energy density @xmath112 becomes more and more peaked when @xmath0 increases , so that , in the thermodynamic limit , almost all samples have the same energy density , which can be computed as @xmath113 for random ksat it can be proved that the above condition holds @xcite .",
    "one of our aims is to compute this limiting value @xmath114 for a fixed value of @xmath5 . for the ksat problem it turns out that this value is equal to zero below a certain threshold @xmath115 , and becomes @xmath116 for @xmath7 . in statistical physics",
    "it is very difficult to go beyond the estimate of the energy density : if one can compute @xmath114 , one knows that @xmath117 is the leading behaviour of the energy for large @xmath0 , but in general one can not control the subleading part , and in principle it could be possible for instance that also in the small @xmath118 phase of ksat where @xmath119 , some finite contribution to @xmath101 ( finite when @xmath120 ) could make the problem typically unsat .",
    "numerical simulations tend to show that this is not the case . knowing @xmath114",
    "will then allow to get the phase diagram of the problem .",
    "but one is also interested in other properties of the generic samples in the thermodynamic limit , like the decomposition of the space of accessible configurations at a given energy , to which we now turn .",
    "one of the main aims of statistical physics is to understand the building up of correlations between distant variables , when the basic interactions between them are short range .",
    "this is precisely the type of question that we need to address here : variables interact locally ( the only direct interactions involve spins connected to the same function node ) .",
    "but we also need to control the correlations established between two spins belonging to the same function node , due to their indirect coupling through other nodes . as we saw , the geometry is such that this indirect interaction builds up through very long ( @xmath121 ) paths .",
    "usually , in the statistical physics of systems with short range interactions , the correlation between distant variables displays a relatively simple variety of behaviours .",
    "the simplest one is when there is only one pure state in the system ( typically a paramagnetic phase ) : then there exists a finite correlation length and the connected correlation function between two distant spins @xmath122 decays exponentially with the distance @xmath123 at large distances : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the correlation length ( @xmath126 can be a constant , or involve power law corrections in the distance ) .",
    "this is called the clustering property . on the other hand",
    ", some systems can also have phase transitions , and display a low temperatue phase with several pure state .    the archetypical case which we briefly describe here as a pedagogical example is the ferromagnetic @xmath127 spin system with energy given by ( [ epsdefpspin ] ) with @xmath128 : at low temperature the spins polarize in one of two pure states , related to each other by the global symmetry changing all @xmath23 to @xmath129 .",
    "let us call a configuration one assignment of the @xmath0 spins , @xmath15 .",
    "the pure states are probability measures on the configuration space obtained using a slightly modified boltzmann measure where one adds an external symmetry breaking magnetic field ( in the present language one adds a function node of connectivity one connected to each variable node @xmath28 , with energy @xmath130 ) .",
    "one computes @xmath131 , which defines the expectation value @xmath132 of spin @xmath28 in each of the two states @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "it is a well known fact that the connected correlation functions within each state have the clustering property : @xmath135 this means that when the spins collectively polarize in the @xmath133 state , the correlations between distant spins vanishes .",
    "it is not true for the full boltzmann measure : if one does not add the small symmetry breaking field @xmath136 , but keeps to the boltzmann measure ( [ boltz ] ) , one gets for any observable @xmath137 ( the fact that the two states enter with equal weight @xmath99 is a consequence of the global symmetry of the original problem ) , and one easily shows that the corresponding correlations do not vanish at large distances .",
    "the lesson we learn from statistical physics is that correlations decay at large distance within each pure state . in problems",
    "more complicated than the ferromagnet it may be difficult to identify the various pure states , especially when we do not have at hand a simple breaking of a symmetry . a large part of the work on spin glasses has been devoted to this problem and we shall not try to reproduce it here ( see @xcite for a review ) , nor to give a general definition of states at finite temperature in our problems .",
    "instead we shall focus on the zero temperature limit ( @xmath138 ) , where the situation is simpler .",
    "a state is defined in the thermodynamic limit as a cluster of configurations , all of equal energy , related to each other by single spin flip moves , and which are locally stable , in the sense that the energy can not be decreased by any flip of a finite number of spins . in the random 3sat problem",
    "one can use an even simpler definition which allows to generalize the definition of states also to finite @xmath0 problems : the condition of local stability can be substituted by a condition of stability with respect to any sequence of one spin flips .",
    "the reason for this simplification , specific to the ksat problem , is that in this case the stability with respect to sequences of single spin flips insure stability with respect to collective flips of finite sets of spins",
    ".      experience with disordered and frustrated systems like glasses shows that there can exist many states , and the number of states typically grows exponentially with the number of variables .",
    "the number of states @xmath139 with energy @xmath17 is written as : @xmath140 where the quantity @xmath141 is called the complexity .",
    "it is a function of @xmath5 and @xmath142 , and the form ( [ complexity_def ] ) is derived from the basic assumption that @xmath143 is extensive .",
    "in general , whenever a problem has a nonzero complexity , one may expect that simple local algorithms will have great difficulty in finding the ground state , simply because the states proliferate ( for large @xmath0 ) and the algorithm will easily get trapped into one state with energy above that of the ground state .",
    "we shall see in the next sections how the cavity method can handle such a situation .",
    "the cavity method was originally introduced in @xcite to study spin glasses , but it gives a general framework for computing statistical properties of various frustrated systems , and is ideally adapted to systems with a locally tree - like structure .",
    "it is always in principle equivalent to the replica method , which is a more compact and very appealing formalism , however it possesses two advantages . on one hand , it proceeds through a standard probabilistic analysis , and makes explicit all the hypotheses involved in it . roughly speaking",
    ", the cavity method assumes some properties about the correlations between variables in a system with @xmath0 spins , and shows that these are self - consistently reproduced for a system with @xmath144 spin system .",
    "the problem in turning it into a rigorous methods is that these hypotheses only hold in the large @xmath0 limit , not for @xmath0 small .",
    "if one is able to have a good control of the correlations as a function of @xmath0 , then the cavity method becomes also a choice method for rigorous probabilistic studies of frustrated systems @xcite . on the other hand , in the cavity method",
    ", one considers explicitely the site dependence of the order parameter , and the averaging over disorder is performed at the end ( this is in contrast with the replica approach where the disorder average is made from the very beginning ) .",
    "as we shall see here , this aspect allows to define some algorithm , inspired from the cavity method , which computes the order parameter on each site for one given sample .    in",
    "what follows we shall be interested in the zero temperature version of the cavity method . as discussed in details in @xcite ,",
    "the formalism simplifies a lot in this limit .",
    "here we shall mainly outline for completeness the basic aspects of the method , applied to the 3-sat model where all function nodes involve exactly three spins ( the generalization to more general problems is totally straightforward but would make the notation more cumbersome ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "we shall first present the method in its simple replica symmetric ( rs ) version where it assumes the presence of a single state , and we shall then turn to the more involved case in which many states exist but are uncorrelated , a situation called one step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) in the replica jargon .         is added to the system , it gets connected through @xmath106 new function nodes to @xmath145 other spins , @xmath146 and @xmath147 . the cavity - field on @xmath146",
    "is denoted by @xmath148 , the one on @xmath147 is denoted by @xmath149 .",
    ", width=453 ]    consider a @xmath0 spin system @xmath150 and its interaction graph , and add to it a new spin @xmath151 . then generate the new function nodes involving this new spin as follows : for each pair @xmath152 , the function node @xmath153 is present with probability @xmath154",
    ". therefore we have added @xmath106 new function nodes which we label by @xmath155 , where @xmath106 is a random variable with probability distribution @xmath156 .",
    "let us consider all the new function nodes which involves , besides @xmath151 , @xmath145 other spins which we call @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( see fig.[fig_iter ] ) .",

    "the reason why this limit is subtle is due to the fact that some of the local fields , at low temperatures , vanish linearly in @xmath459 , and thus contribute to the local magnetization @xmath460 ; we call these fields evanescent fields",

    "this means that , in a given state , a finite number of local fields are non - zero integers , giving rise to magnetizations @xmath44 , as one could expect at zero temperature .",

    "note that our approach working directly at @xmath457 also has its limitations , for instance we are unable to determine precisely the self overlap ( or the typical radius ) of a state , or its internal entropy , precisely because we do not control the evanescent fields .",
    "we leave for future work the delicate study of the small @xmath459 region of the phase diagram .",

    "is performed with the proper probability distribution .",
    "while such an averaging step is central if one wants to estimate typical properties , the iterative equations make perfect sense on a single specific instance .",
    "the order parameters arising from the cavity equations , namely the u - surveys , are histograms of probability distributions of cavity biases .",
    "they determine the bias of each spin in all metastable states of a given energy density for a given instance of the underlying factor - graph .",

    "however the idea of exploiting the information on optimal states carried by the functional order parameter is rather general and we expect algorithmic applications in different fields .",
    "whenever the factor graph representing the problem does not lead to clustering within states , in practice whenever loops are short enough , one should think to the present approach as a first step of a sequence of possible approximations .",
    "as is well known , the so called cluster variation method@xcite provides a systematic scheme that can be adopted to improve the approximate results given by the cavity approach@xcite .",

    "of course this higher level of description is useful only when there are many states , which will be typically the case in hard optimization problems .",
    "one a - priori drawback of the approach is that the messages are complicated , being functional probability distributions : a cavity - bias is already a parametrization of a probability distribution ( which turns out to be parametrized by a single variable in our case of binary spins , but could be more complicated in general ) ; here the u - surveys are probability distribution functions of these cavity - biases . in cases like ksat at @xmath457 in which the standard messages can take only few values ( say @xmath464 ) , a u - survey is given by the probabilities of these values , i.e. by @xmath465 real numbers and the sp can be implemented easily .",

    "then one could proceed in finding a satisfying assignment just by converting the decision algorithm into a search algorithm as follows  @xcite .",
    "a variable is selected and fixed to one value .",
    "we then use sp to evaluate the gs energy of the subproblem of size @xmath530 and decide whether it is still sat or not . if the subproblem is sat then we keep the assignment , otherwise the opposite value of the binary variable is chosen .",
    "the process is repeated untill all the variables have been exhausted ( in at most @xmath531 steps ) .",
    "if along this reduction process the subsystem becomes a paramagnet , then sp becomes ineffective and another search algorithm must be used on the subsystem ( but for a paramagnet it is very easy to find the ground state ) .",
    "the above scheme , however , suffers from finite size effects and from the imprecision in the determination of the ground state energy , a fact which is particularly important close to @xmath115 .",
    "moreover it does not take advantage of the information provided by the u - surveys .",
    "a somewhat coarse grained information contained in the u - surveys , once sp has reached convergence , is the one given by the total weights @xmath532 of the local field distribution which gives the fraction of states where the spin @xmath23 is positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) .",
    "having computed these weights , we may distinguish three reference types of spins ( of course all the intermediate cases will also be present ) : the _ paramagnetic _ ones with @xmath533 , the _ biased _ ones with @xmath534 or @xmath535 and the _ balanced _ ones with @xmath536 and @xmath537 small .    in order to characterize the differences between these various types of variables ,",

    "has an effect only on the internal entropy of the states ( which we can not measure ) but leaves the energy unaltered .",
    "interestingly enough , balanced spin have an enormous effect : the most balanced ones produce a decrease very close to @xmath538 in the complexity , indeed half of the states are eliminated by fixing one single balanced variable!.     versus the number of violated clauses ( i.e. one half of the extensive energy ) of an instance of 3sat with @xmath539 and @xmath540 . the difference in the two curves",
    "is very close to @xmath538.,width=453 ]      one strategy for using this information in order to produce an optimization algorithm is to fix as many variables as possible without altering the ground state energy , evaluated step by step as the size of the problem decreases",
    ". eventually , either all variables have been fixed or ( more likely ) the remaining variables turn out to be paramagnetic ( i.e. @xmath498 , @xmath499 ) , in which case a simple search process can be run to find the complete ground state configuration .",
    "a straightforward implementation of the above ideas provides a simple algorithm that can be used to find solutions to random 3sat in the hard region @xmath541 $ ] .",
    "we do not expect this implementation to be the most efficient one , in that no particular strategy has been worked out to optimize the decimation process .",

    "step a single variable is fixed according to the outcome of sp and the effect of such fixing is used to simplify the problem .",
    "the size of the problem reduces from @xmath542 to @xmath543 , where @xmath544 is the number of variables which become fixed due to the simplification of the problem : satisfied clauses are eliminated , unsatisfied k clauses are transformed into ( k-1 ) clauses .",
    "@xmath545 clauses need to be satisfied and therefore their variables are properly fixed ( unit clause propagation ) leading to further spin elimination .    at the beginning of the process , randomly chosen balanced spins can be fixed in order to reduce the number of states . at each step one may compute the free energy to detect the onset of violated clauses .",
    "one may also evaluate the function @xmath275 to have an estimate of the complexity .",
    "successively , biased spins are fixed .",
    "whenever a paramagnetic state is found , or at some intermediate steps , a rapid search process like simulated annealing at a fixed cooling rate or walksat is run on the sub - system .",
    "we may end up either by having found a solution or by having still few violated clauses . in the latter case",
    "we may simply restart .",

    "* ) else ( if a contradiction is reached ) restart ( * go to 0 . * )    extensive numerical experiments on random 3sat instances at @xmath438 with size up to @xmath549 have shown a remarkable efficiency of sid .",
    "while the process of fixing a single variable takes some time ( @xmath550 operations ) the number of assignments explored is very small . at @xmath438 typically a single run of sid ( i.e. with no restarts ) leads to a solution .",
    "closer to the critical @xmath118 , few restarts might be necessary in order to find a configuration of strictly zero energy",
    ". however , at each run the typical energy found by sid is very close to zero , well below the energy at which simulated annealing gets stuck .",

    "we have derived here two main results .",
    "the first one concerns the phase diagram of the random ksat problem , and establishes the existence of an intermediate phase where the problem is sat but the solution is difficult to find because of the existence of many states .",
    "we would like to point out that the cavity method which we have used here is not rigorous : it relies on some hypotheses which can be true only for large systems and are thus difficult to prove ( although this can be done in some cases @xcite ) .",
    "however the experience gained from similar problems , together with numerical results of this and previous papers , indicates that this solution is likely to be the correct one .",
    "if higher order replica symmetry breaking effects would show up , one can believe that in any case their quantitative influence on the results should be rather small .",
    "it should also be noted that the very same cavity strategy which we have used here has been tested on a variant of the ksat , the xorsat problem , which can be also solved by exact methods @xcite . in this case , the existence of the intermediate phase has been confirmed and all the predictions ( qualitative and quantitative ) from the cavity method have been checked rigorously @xcite .",
    "the second result gives a new class of message passing algorithms for solving optimization problems in the regime where the proliferation of metastable states slows down a lot all the local algorithms .",
    "one such algorithm turns out to be quite powerful on the case of random 3sat problems . clearly",
    "a lot of work needs to be done in order to develop such algorithms in various contexts and test them against traditional strategies . a more direct derivation and understanding of the algorithm , and in particular of the nontrivial reweighting term , would also be welcome .    finally , we expect that the _ single sample sp method _ at finite temperature can become a useful tool in analyzing the fine structure of order parameters in disordered systems and other complex systems .",
