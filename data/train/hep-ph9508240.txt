    "the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation  @xcite provides a consistent covariant description for bound state of two fermions ( or fermion - antifermion ) . in particular , a phenomenological success has been achieved in the case of the deuteron describing ground state properties and various reactions  @xcite .",
    "it has been established that bs formalism reproduces the bulk of the non - relativistic approaches at the nucleon momenta small comparing to the nucleon mass , @xmath6 , but displays a relativistic effects at larger momenta @xmath7 and in some of the spin - dependent observables",
    ". however , the relativistic effects are not too large , since the deuteron is essentially a non - relativistic system .",
    "another topical subject studied within the bs formalism is the bound state of the quark - antiquark systems , mesons ( @xmath8 ) . compared to the deuteron case",
    "the @xmath8-bound states are governed by a more complex dynamics and , correspondly , physics here is richer . usual way to proceed here",
    "is to reduce the bs equation to an approximate equation of the quasi - potential form and then to use approaches and methods similar to those which are used in the non - relativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "a number of the specific questions of principle and technical problems must be resolved in order to reach the same state - of - art as it is in the case of the deuteron :    1 .",
    "first , we need a rigorous method to obtain the bound state spectrum and the corresponding amplitudes for the bs equation . today",
    "we do not find in the literature a discussion of this problem without making approximations .",
    "second , the fundamental problem here is a construction of an effective theory , which would provide the bs equation with confinement .",
    "moreover , it is not clear how the confinement should manifest itself in this formalism .",
    "third problem , we would like to mention here , is the `` problem of light quarks ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) '' . for the formalism ofthe bs equation",
    "we understand this problem as a description of the dynamical generation of the masses and creating the bound states with a mass , which is much larger then sum of the `` bare '' masses of the constituents .",
    "apparently , physics of light quarks is essentially different of physics of heavy quarks",
    ". we will not discuss the special problems of light quarks physics in this paper .",
    "all these problems were discussed starting the pioneering work of llewellyn - smith  @xcite .",
    "there are , of course , methods to study the spectrum based on the reduction of the two - dimensional integral equations to an _ infinite _ system of one dimensional equations by means of the hyperspherical harmonics and , then cutting off the system at some lowest functions as an approximation  @xcite .",
    "this method is valid for the tightly bound states , with mass vanishing compared to the sum of the constituent masses , in which case the bs equation has an exact @xmath11-symmetry .",
    "this was sufficient for early studies , where the mechanism of the confinement was modeled as the binding of the heavy quarks to the relatively light bound states .",
    "however , it has become clear that even for heavy quarks the mass spectrum of the mesons lies near and even above the sum of the constituent masses .",
    "therefore other methods must be employed to at the spectrum with such characteristics .",
    "alternative approaches to the study of the spectrum of the relativistic bound state is based on the reduction of the bs equation to one of the possible quasi - potential equations and then utilizing the schrdinger - like potentials , @xmath12 , in the coordinate space  @xcite or its generalization in the momentum space  @xcite . in spite of the obvious advantages of these approaches , such as clear physical interpretation of interactions and solutions with relationship to the schrdinger equation approach  @xcite ,",
    "still there is interest to study the full bs equation , which gives direct connection to the covariant field theory .    as to the underlying effective field theory for the relativistic equations of the bound states ,",
    "now we can only imagine about the structure of such a theory and its connection to the fundamental theory , qcd .",
    "the approach based on the integral equations of the field theory  @xcite , the set of schwinger - dyson equations for propagators , the ward - takahashi relations ( slavnov - taylor relations ) and the bethe - salpeter equation is very promissing .",
    "the model investigations presented here allow for a study of the properties of the analytical structure of the quark propagator  @xcite , the mechanisms of the chiral symmetry breaking and the dynamical generation of the masses  @xcite and the connections with the bound state problem  @xcite and observables of reactions  @xcite .    in the present paper we ( i ) consider the problem of the spectrum of the two - body bs equation with no reduction to the quasipotential equation or other approximations and ( ii ) attempt to construct a model for the confinement , based on the formal properties of the kernels , but with no direct connection with qcd .",
    "we present , in section  2 , a method to find the ground states and excited states in the channel with any quantum numbers .",
    "the illustrative numerical calculations , aimed to show capabilities of the method are presented in section  2.3 .",
    "we consider in section  3 the formal properties of the kernel in the form of a sum of the ladder kernels . we derive conditions when this kernel displays properties , similar to the non - relativistic constant potential in the coordinate space .",
    "the implementation of this interaction to the single particle propagator leads to the disappearance of the singularities in the propagator . using the developed method to study the bound state spectrum we analyze the bs equation with this kernel and self - energy corrections in section  3.3 .",
    "combination of properties of the solutions in this case allows for an interpretation of the interaction of this type as the confining interaction .",
    "_ nota bene_. in this paper we often use the name `` quark '' for the constituents and the `` meson '' for the bound system .",
    "this is just a matter of convenience and our concrete calculations are not based on the qcd and do not pretend to a phenomenological application .",
    "moreover , the illustrative analytical and numerical calculations are presented for a model with massive scalar particles with scalar interactions , the `` massive wick model '' .",
    "however , the methods can be applied directly to the bs equation for two spinor fields interacting via a phenomenological @xmath8-interaction .",
    "the spectrum of the spinor - spinor bs equation has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite with no confining interaction , and the application of the model with the confinement to the meson spectrum will be done elsewhere .",
    "the bs equation for bound state of two equal mass scalar fields , `` quarks '' , interacting via scalar exchanges has a form : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bs amplitude for the bound state with momentum @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a kernel of bs equation and @xmath17 is the two - body propagator . generally speaking , the kernel @xmath18 is a sum of the all renormalized irreducible graphs presenting the green s function with two incoming and two outcoming constituent fields and the propagator @xmath19 is product of the renormalized full single - particle propagators . in practice , however , both of them are usually taken in the lowest order in the coupling constant .",
    "it corresponds to the ladder approximation for the kernel with free particle propagators . in the simplest case of an exchange field of mass @xmath20 and coupling",
    "constant @xmath21 , the ladder approximation for the kernel has an explicit form : @xmath22 the two - body propagator then reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is free one - particle propagator , @xmath25 is the mass of the constituents and @xmath26 are the constituent momenta .",

    "more degrees of freedom are provided by introducing a sum of the exchanges with different parameters and different lorents structure , e.g. vector or pseudoscalar exchanges . in the presence of the several ( effective ) exchanges with different quantum numbers and in higher orders kernel",
    "may contains both attractive and repulsive terms .",
    "here we consider the kernel of the form : @xmath27 where index @xmath28 enumerates different `` exchange '' terms , distinguished by the mass parameter , @xmath29 , and strength , @xmath30 .",
    "factor @xmath31 defines attractive ( @xmath32 ) or repulsive ( @xmath33 ) type of the correspondent term .",
    "being interpreted as contribution of the lowest order diagram , the terms with negative value of @xmath34 require either antihermitian term in the interaction hamiltonian ( lagrangian ) or fields with additional quantum numbers . however , we consider the entire sum in the eq .",
    "( [ kerg ] ) as a convenient parametrization of the unknown full kernel of the bs equation .",
    "the convenience of such a form of the kernel is that kernel is explicitly covariant and contains only `` field theoretical '' elements , the free particle propagators . accepting this way of action , we assume that parameters of the kernel should be fixed to describe the experimentally known spectrum of the system .",
    "the free propagator @xmath17 of the form ( [ twoprop ] ) and the kernel in the ladder approximation , ( [ ladk ] ) or ( [ kerg ] ) , usually provide the basis for an investigation of the bs equation .",
    "the parameters for a phenomenological adjustment of the theoretical framework are the coupling constants , @xmath30 , and exchange masses , @xmath29 .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 in the propagator is referred to as `` physical mass '' of the constituent and it is supposed to include effectively the self - energy corrections . in the case of the observable particles , e.g. nucleons",
    ", @xmath25 is the observable mass , otherwise , e.g. quarks , it has rather ambiguous model - dependent value .    in order to study the spectrum of the bs equation we , first , fix the frame of calculation as the rest frame of the system , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the mass of the system , `` meson '' .",
    "then , we perform the well - known wick rotation  @xcite , which may later cause difficulties in the calculation of observables of some reactions , but does not affect the spectrum of the equation and simplifies the numerical analysis . under the wick rotation",

    "in the case of the generalized kernel ( [ kerg ] ) , there will be a sum over different terms on the right hand side of eq .",

    "then by inverting the mapping as @xmath59 , we will find solutions of the eigenvalue problem for @xmath36 with the kernel @xmath60 , where factor @xmath45 is trivially absorbed by redefining the coupling constants .",
    "traditional methods to find solutions to the linear eigenvalue problem corresponding to the integral equation ( [ sbsel ] ) are based on the ideas of the classical fredholm theory .",
    "the basic idea here is to substitute integration by a summation and then deal with a sufficiently large system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "the problem is reduced to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix corresponding to the integral operator @xmath61 . however , in the case of the covariant bs equation such a program of action meets extra difficulties in view of the double integration , which leads necessarily to very large matrices , say @xmath62 or even larger in the case of spinor - spinor equation ( with additional factor of @xmath63 if the parity is conserved by interactions and factor 256 if it does not ) .",
    "we use an alternate method based on the iteration of the bs equation in the form ( [ sbsem ] ) .",

    "more relevant approach is based on the simultaneous analysis of the bs , schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equations and ward - takahashi at the lowest order and with the model gluon propagator  @xcite . in particular , the role of the analytical structure ( structure of singularities ) of the quark propagators is discussed here .",
    "it is found that , with certain choices of the model gluon propagator , the quark propagator is an entire function ( function with no singularities ) at physical momentum of the quark .",
    "this important property of the quark propagator is considered as an indication of confinement  @xcite .",
    "these two examples present two essentially different pictures of what is referred to as confinement . in the first case ,",
    "the confinement is the two - body effect , i.e. quarks can not escape from each other because of the interaction between them . in the second example , confinement is attributed to the property of a single quark , which can not propagate as a free particle .",
    "the general formalism of the field theory suggests that the two - body and the single particle phenomena are in a generic relationship .",
    "so do the approaches based on the bs and sd equations .",
    "our approach to a modeling of the confinement is in some sense inverse to that of refs .",
    "we , first , construct the covariant kernel of the bs equation which , we expect , would provide the confinement and only then study the modifications of the quark propagators involved in the bs equation .",
    "we start from a few unsophisticated observations prompted by the non - relativistic picture :    1 .   in the non - relativistic limit",
    "the covariant theory can be reduced to the formalism with the schrdinger equation , where we can expect the picture of the confinement as interaction with non - vanishing potential at @xmath104 to be valid .",
    "the main distinguishing feature of the spectrum here is the existence of the bound states above the two quark mass limit , @xmath103 .",
    "it is not necessary to have an infinitely rising potential , if we intend to discuss only a few lowest levels in the spectrum .",
    "more manageable potential , @xmath105 at @xmath104 , could be sufficient , if @xmath4 is large enough . in this sense",
    ", we also refer to the constant potential as a confining one .",
    "the potential in the momentum space @xmath106 can be obtained as a non - relativistic limit of the kernel @xmath18 , similar to @xmath107 if the kernel is of the form ( [ ladk ] ) .",
    "important point here is that the non - relativistic form of the potential ( [ yuk ] ) is of a field - theoretic origin .",

    "however , without numerical analysis we are not able to discuss the properties of the solutions at @xmath146 .",
    "before to go to the numerics , let us discuss the possible effects of the self energy corrections in the presence of the interaction of the form ( [ krel ] ) .",
    "dealing with the kernel ( [ krel ] ) as a sum of the lowest order ( ladder ) kernels , we calculate the one - loop self - energy corrections to the single quark propagator , @xmath24 .",
    "integration over the loop is performed at imaginary @xmath147 component of the four - momentum of the quark and result can be analytically continued to any values of @xmath147 .",
    "for physical momentum we get : @xmath148 the propagator ( [ singprop ] ) does not have singularities for physical values of the momentum , @xmath41 .",
    "this property of the interaction of the form ( [ krel ] ) has already been established within model investigations of the behavior of the quark propagator  @xcite .",
    "now we see that this single quark effect is in a generic relation with the two - body confining interaction in the framework of the bs equation . for our calculations",
    "it is also important that the singularities of the modified two - body propagator in ( [ 2con ] ) with @xmath149 defined by eq .",
    "( [ singprop ] ) still allow to perform the wick rotation .",
    "first we compare the meson spectra obtained with eq .",
    "( [ 2con ] ) with @xmath150 and @xmath151 . for convenience",
    "we take the same kernel , @xmath152 , as that in the section  2.3 . the main effect",
    ", we expect here , is the shift of the spectrum beyond the limiting point @xmath88 . in order to compare the spectra",
    ", we calculate @xmath58 for two lowest states in the channels with @xmath153 .",
    "this is enough to make conclusions about ( i ) the position of the bound states , ( ii ) limiting point of the spectra and ( iii ) separation between ground and excited states .",
    "results of these calculations are presented in the fig .  3 , groups of curves a and b. the constant @xmath136 for the case b",
    "is chosen to be of the typical energy scale of the equation , @xmath154 .",
    "we find , indeed , that the masen spectrum of the equation with @xmath155 is extended beyond the point @xmath103 .",
    "however , it displays unusual behavior beyond the point , @xmath156 ( this point is shown on fig .  3 by the arrow )",
    "non - monotonical behavior of the curves @xmath58 indicates some difficulties in the interpretation of the corresponding solutions .",
    "the obvious difficulty is the existence of two solutions with the same coupling constant @xmath45 and different masses , @xmath36 , ( see e.g. discussions in refs .",
    "therefore , we have to find a way to isolate the only one physical solutions .",
    "the solution of this problem is quite simple . calculating the normalization of the solutions of the equation along @xmath36 we find that the ground state solutions beyond @xmath156 have a negative norm , i.e. are the _ abnormal _ non - physical solutions .",
    "this observation gives us the selection rule to eliminate the extra solutions .",
    "another problem with the solutions corresponding @xmath151 is that spectrum is not only shifted to larger masses , but also the separation between levels is drastically increased ( see table  ii ) .",
    "this effect make it a problem for a phenomenological use of the kernel of the form ( [ krel ] ) . indeed ,",
    "if we intend to consider states above @xmath103 we have to take @xmath139 large enough to provide us with a new limit of the spectrum , however this can be in conflict with the desired separation between levels .",
    "one may try to adjust the parameters of the remaining part of the full kernel , @xmath152 , so as to have a reasonable density of levels .",
    "however our analysis showed that in the presence of the kernel , @xmath122 , separation between levels depends only weakly on the kernel , @xmath152 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table .",
    "the levels splitting in the `` scalar charmonium '' for different kernels .",
    "it should be remembered that in the bs equation the addition of interaction of any kind to the full kernel can not be related linearly to the shift in the mass of the system .",
    "the same interaction also `` shifts '' the masses of the constituents through the self - energy corrections to the single - particle propagators .",
    "a self - consitent approach has to be adopted to include both the self - energy corrections and changes in the two - body interactions .",
    "we take into account the self - energy correction , ( [ singprop ] ) , to the quark propagator .",
    "this leads to a corresponding modification of the two - body propagator @xmath157 , ( [ twoprop ] ) . the resulting spectrum is presented in fig .  3 , group of curves c. it is clear that for the interval of masses @xmath158  gev the density of levels `` returns to normal '' , of the same value as in the case a ( see table  ii ) . the value of constant @xmath159 is chosen as an example giving the spectrum density close to the the one of the case a. at smaller @xmath160 the separation of levels is even smaller .",
    "the examples of calculations , b and c , show that the kernel containing the part @xmath122 is indeed similar in its effect to the non - relativistic potential in coordinate space , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . where the positive real constant @xmath4 defines the shift of the bound state spectrum compared to the case with no @xmath122 , the case a. from fig .",
    "3 another similarity with the non - relativistic constant potential is obvious , this kernel gives only a limited number of states in the spectrum , which can be adjusted by varying the @xmath161 .",
    "for instance , for the case c with @xmath162 there is only one bound state , @xmath163 , whereas with @xmath164 there are four states in the s and p channels ( there can be other undetected states in channels with higher @xmath165 ) .",
    "on the other hand , taking account of the self - energy corrections , corresponding to this type of interaction , leads to the disappearance of the poles in the single quark propagator .",
    "therefore quarks can not propagate other than being bound in a bound state .",
    "apparently , this fact is not related to the infinitely rising interaction between them , but rather to the modification of the single quark properties .    to be sure that the picture is valid in a wide interval of the constant @xmath139 , also the spectrum is calculated for the case @xmath166 and self - energy corrections taken into account .",
    "the result is shown in the fig .  3 , group of curves d. that the picture is found to be similar to the one of case c , but the spectrum is shifted up to even larger @xmath167  gev . the density of levels in the interval of masses @xmath168  gev is the same as those of cases a and c ( see table  ii ) .",
    "the value of constant @xmath159 is chosen again to give the spectrum density close to the the one of the case a.    note that in our model the constant @xmath136 can not be taken arbitrary large , since all the calculations are performed in the lowest order .",
    "the natural criteria on the maximum value of @xmath136 is that the corrections of the lowest order , @xmath137 , must not be too large .",
    "for instance , a shift of the mass spectrum with @xmath169 should not be too big compare to the typical masses for the case with @xmath170 .",
    "we have presented a method to find the ground state and excited states of the two - body bethe - salpeter equation for a channel with any quantum numbers .",
    "this method allows us to solve the bound state problem without reduction of equation to quasipotential form or any other approximations .",
    "based on a qualitative analogy with the construction of a non - relativistic potential with non - vanishing asymptote at large distances , @xmath171 , we have proposed a recipe to obtain the confining kernel for the bethe - salpeter equation , parametrized in the form of a special limiting case of a superposition of ladder kernels . we find that in the simplest case such a kernel is proportional to @xmath172 in the euclidean momentum space , which corresponds to a constant kernel in the coordinate space .",
    "we have studied the effect of this kernel on the spectrum of the bethe - salpeter equation , when the usual attractive interaction is added .",
    "it is found that this kernel is similar in its effect to the non - relativistic potential in coordinate space , @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .",
    "the positive real constant @xmath4 gives the scale that defines the limit of the bound state spectrum compared to the sum of the constituent masses , @xmath5 . at the same time",
    "the self - energy corrections remove the singularities from the propagators of the constituents , i.e. constituents do not propagate .",
    "combination of these features of the solutions allows an interpretation of this type of interaction as a confining interaction .",
    "the illustrative analytical and numerical calculation are presented for a model of massive scalar particles with scalar interaction and do not pretend to a phenomenological application .",
    "however , the developed formalism can be straightforwarly adopted for the bethe - salpeter equation for the bound state of two spinor fields and , therefore , can be used for the realistic studies of the properties of the quark - antiquark systems , mesons .",
