    "at least three of the rotation - powered pulsars seen in high - energy gamma rays by egret ( crab , vela , psr b1951 + 32 ) are neutron stars in snr . a fourth , psr b1706@xmath144 ,",
    "would be expected from its age to have a visible snr , but the observational evidence is unclear .",
    "( dodson , gvamaradze , these proceedings . )",
    "because egret and previous gamma - ray telescopes lacked the resolution to distinguish neutron star emission from nebular emission , the only certain detections are based on pulsed emission .",
    "the recent discovery by halpern et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of psr j2229 + 6114 , a young , high spindown rate radio and x - ray pulsar in an egret source error box strongly suggests an association with the egret source based on energetics ( halpern , these proceedings ) . we have applied three approaches to searching for pulsations in the egret data .",
    "such a search is necessary , because the egret observations occurred years before the pulsar discovery , and pulsars in this age range are typically noisy and/or subject to glitches .",
    "the methods :    \\1 .",
    "we applied the program described in jones ( 1998 ) and jones et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to the data in vp34 , the viewing period with the greatest detection significance .",
    "this program uses the ideas of gregory & loredo ( 1992 ) , extended to take into account the angular distribution of the detected photons and the diffuse backgrounds observed by egret .",
    "it calculates a likelihood for each assumed pulsar period , using a 5-bin light curve , marginalizing over the arbitrary choice of zero phase .    \\2 .",
    "we carried out a frequency scan on barycentered event files ( 100@xmath1300 , 300@xmath11000 , 100@xmath11000 , @xmath21000 mev ) for 10 viewing periods .",
    "h - test and protheroe - test statistics were applied .",
    "we made a pulse folding search on barycentered event files e@xmath050 mev using individual viewing periods , then attempted to link the best results into a coherent timing solution .",
    "the statistics used were the h - test and rayleigh test .",
    "the most promising solution is shown in fig .",
    "1 , for vp34 .",
    "the energy and angle cuts have been optimized to maximize the significance .",
    "the resemblance of this light curve to others seen in egret data ( two peaks separated by 0.4@xmath10.5 phase ) is intriguing , but the other viewing periods , all of which had lower statistics but were closer in time to the observed radio and x - ray data , produced no consistent , confirming signal . by itself , even this optimized signal is of marginal significance ( @xmath21% probability of chance occurrence ) based on the trials factor .",
    "we do * not * claim a detection .",
    "the limitation on searches of the egret data is statistical : the number of source photons in excess of the diffuse gamma radiation is too small .",
    "all three of the techniques described above have demonstrated the ability to find pulsations for sufficiently bright sources . the glast large area telescope ( lat ) will have a much greater effective area ( factor of @xmath36 at 1 gev ) and a narrower point - spread function ( factor of @xmath33 at 1 gev ) than egret .",
    "in addition , the field of view will be more than 4 times larger than egret s , and the lat will scan to avoid occultation by the earth , increasing by a large factor the total number of photons detected . the greater rates of photons from pulsar candidates and better discrimination of diffuse interstellar emission will enhance the sensitivity of pulsation searches .",
    "analyses of lat performance ( e.g. , chandler et al .",
    "2001 ; carramiana 2001 ) show that periodicities should be detectable if present in any of the known low - latitude egret sources .",
    "observations with the lat on glast should clarify the nature of the gamma - ray emission of egret sources positionally associated with snr as well as fainter snr / plerion / pulsar sources .",
    "the limits for resolving or closely localizing sources with the lat depend on the spectral characteristics of the sources , the intensity of the interstellar emission from the milky way , and of course the observing strategy , so general statements about resolving power are difficult to make .",
    "the imaging capability of the lat for snr is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 using a model for @xmath4-cygni that is consistent with the egret observations ( see allen et al .",
    "the egret data suggest spatially extended high - energy emission , and the model assigns 40% of the flux of the egret source to emission from cosmic - ray interactions with interstellar gas at the edge of the snr shell .",
    "successful multiwavelength identification campaigns toward unidentified egret sources coincident with snrs often find point sources as more convincing candidates for the observed gamma - ray emission than other emission mechanisms in an snr . for bright and steady hard spectrum gamma - ray sources such as @xmath4-cygni",
