    "quantum error correction @xcite and fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite promise to allow almost perfect storage , transmission and manipulation of quantum information . without them ,",
    "quantum information processing would be doomed to failure due to the decoherence produced by interactions with the environment and the unavoidable inaccuracies of quantum operations .",
    "the key concept in quantum error correction is the notion of quantum code .",
    "this is a subspace of a given quantum system where quantum information can be safely encoded , in the sense that the adverse effects of noise can be erased through an error correction procedure . in practice",
    "this procedure is also subject to errors and thus it should be as simple as possible to minimize them . naturally , the meaning of ` simple ' will depend on particular implementations .",
    "a common situation is that interactions are restricted to quantum subsystems that are close to each other in space . in those cases ,",
    "the locality of the operations involved in error correction becomes crucial .",
    "the stabilizer formalism @xcite provides a unified framework for many quantum codes . in stabilizer codes",
    "the main step for error correction is the measurement of certain operators , which may be local or not .",
    "a class of codes where these measurements are intrinsically local is that of topological stabilizer codes @xcite . in a different direction",
    ", locality can also be enhanced by considering more generally stabilizer subsystem codes @xcite .",
    "the present work provides an example of a family of codes which can be labeled both as ` topological ' and ` subsystem ' .",
    "topological codes where originally introduced with the goal of obtaining a self - protecting quantum computer @xcite .",
    "this idea faces important difficulties in low dimensions , since thermal instabilities are known to occur @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "topological codes are local in a natural way and have very interesting features in the context of active error correction .",
    "for example , they do not only allow to perform operations transversally @xcite but also through code deformations @xcite .",
    "moreover , there exist a useful connection between error correction in topological codes and certain classical statistical models @xcite .",
    "stabilizer subsystem codes are the result of applying the stabilizer formalism to operator quantum error correction @xcite . in subsystem codes",
    "part of the logical qubits that form the code subspace are no longer considered as such but , rather , as gauge qubits where no information is encoded .",
    "this not only allows the gauge qubits to absorb the effect of errors , but has interesting consequences for error correction . it may allow to break up each of the needed measurements in several ones that involve a smaller number of qubits @xcite .",
    "an example of this is offered by bacon - shor codes @xcite , in which the basic operators to be measured can have support on an arbitrarily large number of qubits , yet their eigenvalues can be recovered from 2-local measurements that do not damage encoded information . moreover , the pairs of qubits to be measured together are always neighbors in a 2d lattice .",
    "thus , subsystem codes can have very nice locality properties .",
    "the 2d topological subsystem codes introduced here show all the characteristic properties of topological codes and at the same time take profit of the advantages of subsystem codes .",
    "some of them are :    * the codes are local in a 2d setting , which can be flat . *",
    "the measurements needed for error correction only involve two neighboring qubits at a time , as in bacon - shor codes .",
    "this is an important advantage with respect to other topological codes , such as surface codes , that require measuring groups of at least 4 qubits .",
    "* most errors of length up to @xmath0 are correctable , where @xmath1 is some constant and @xmath2 the number of physical qubits .",
    "this feature , common to topological codes , follows from the fact that logical operators are related to strings that wind nontrivially around the surface where the code is defined .",
    "* error correction must be done only ` up to homology ' , an important simplification that allows the introduction of specific tools .",
    "* one can naturally perform certain logical gates through ` deformations ' of the code .",
    "this feature , however , is less powerful that in other topological codes because boundaries can not be introduced in the usual way .",
    "since these codes are topological , it is natural to expect a connection between their correction procedures and suitable classical statistical models .",
    "however , the mapping between surface codes and random ising models @xcite makes stronge use of their css structure @xcite , and the same is true for the one between color codes and 3-body random ising models @xcite .",
    "the css structure makes it possible to completely separate the correction of phase flip and bit flip errors , making the problem classical and enabling the connection .",
    "indeed , there exist similar mappings from classical codes to statistical models @xcite .",
    "fortunately , as explained in section vi , the approach can be generalized even in the absence of this separation . moreover",
    ", the subsystem structure is also compatible with the approach , so that it can be applied to the family of codes of interest .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections ii and iii go over several aspects of quantum error correction and topological codes , respectively , setting up a framework for the rest of the paper .",
    "section iv introduces the family of topological subsystem codes and presents a thorough study of their properties .",
    "section v offers the construction of a general mapping between error correction in subsystem codes and classical statistical models .",
    "section vi is devoted to conclusions .",
    "this section summarizes the notions of quantum error correction that will be needed in the rest of the paper .",
    "it mainly reviews stabilizer codes , both in the subspace and the more general subsystem formulation .",
    "ideal error correction procedures and their success probability are also considered .",
    "quantum error correction deals with the preservation of quantum information in the presence of noise . both the noise @xmath3 and the error recovery @xmath4",
    "are modeled as quantum operations or channels @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the space of linear operators on @xmath7 , the hilbert space associated to the quantum system under consideration .",
    "such maps can always be expressed in the operator - sum representation .",
    "for example , the noise is @xmath8 for some @xmath9 , which will be denoted by @xmath10 .    in the original formulation of quantum error correction @xcite",
    ", quantum information is encoded in a subspace of @xmath7 , the code subspace @xmath11 .",
    "the system undergoes a noisy process @xmath3 and afterwards an error recovery operation @xmath4 is performed .",
    "then , given a code @xmath12 , a noise source @xmath3 is said to be correctable if there exists a recovery operation @xmath4 such that @xmath13 for any state @xmath14 .    more generally , in the operator quantum error correction formalism @xcite , information is encoded in a subsystem @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "whatever happens to subsystem @xmath17 is irrelevant .",
    "that is , error recovery is possible for a quantum channel @xmath3 if there exists a recovery operation @xmath4 such that for any @xmath18 and @xmath19 it gives @xmath20 for some arbitrary @xmath21 .",
    "the sufficient and necessary condition for the noise process @xmath10 to be correctable @xcite is that @xmath22 for every @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the projector onto the code subspace .",
    "when this condition holds , the set of errors @xmath26 is said to be correctable . since adding a linear combination of the @xmath27 to the set does not change correctability , it is natural to consider correctable sets of errors as linear subspaces and to choose the most convenient operator basis .",
    "generally the quantum system is composed of @xmath2 qubits , @xmath28 , and error operators are chosen to be pauli operators , elements of the pauli group @xmath29 .",
    "here @xmath30 , @xmath31 are as usual the pauli operators on the @xmath23-th qubit , @xmath32 , @xmath33 in the orthonormal basis @xmath34 .",
    "usually error models are such that errors which affect more qubits are less likely to happen .",
    "then it makes sense to correct as many errors as possible among those that have support on ( act nontrivially on ) a smaller number of qubits .",
    "the weight @xmath35 of a pauli operator @xmath36 is defined as the number of qubits that form its support .",
    "when a code can correct all pauli errors @xmath37 with @xmath38 it is said to correct @xmath39 errors .      a formalism that has been particularly successful for the development of quantum codes is the stabilizer formalism @xcite , in which the code @xmath12 is described in terms of an abelian subgroup @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "take the generators @xmath42 to be independent and let @xmath43 be the rank of @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath2 qubit hilbert space @xmath45 can be partitioned according to the eigenvalues of the @xmath42 into @xmath46 isomorphic orthogonal subspaces @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the error syndrome , with @xmath49 the eigenvalue of @xmath42 . by convention",
    ", the code subspace @xmath12 is that with @xmath50 for all @xmath24 .",
    "it has dimension @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the number of encoded or logical qubits .",
    "the reason to call @xmath53 the error syndrome is that in can be obtained by measuring the @xmath42 and then used to infer which errors have produced .",
    "it is easy to introduce a pauli group for the @xmath54 logical qubits .",
    "let @xmath55 be the normalizer of @xmath44 in @xmath56 .",
    "its elements are the pauli operators that map the subspaces @xmath57 onto themselves , and the quotient group @xmath58 is isomorphic to @xmath59 .",
    "the logical pauli operators are then generated by @xmath60 , some chosen representatives of the images of @xmath61 under a given isomorphism .",
    "it is also possible to characterize a stabilizer code with a pair @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is an automorphism of @xmath56 and @xmath43 an integer , @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath65 , @xmath66 denote the images of @xmath30 , @xmath31 trough @xmath63",
    ". then the stabilizer is @xmath67 .",
    "this approach directly provides a choice for encoded pauli operators : @xmath68 .",
    "pauli errors @xmath37 have a specially simple effect on the encoded states , as they map the subspaces @xmath57 one onto another .",
    "set @xmath69 when @xmath70 .",
    "then a pauli error @xmath37 maps @xmath12 onto @xmath71 .",
    "pauli operators are divided in three categories .",
    "the elements of @xmath72 map the code to other subspaces and are termed detectable errors , as their effect can be detected by measuring the operators @xmath73 .",
    "the elements of @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , map in a nontrivial way the code to itself and are thus called undetectable errors .",
    "finally , the elements of @xmath76 have no effect on encoded states @xmath77 .",
    "the distance @xmath78 of the code is defined as the minimum weight among undetectable errors .",
    "it determines the number of corrected errors , which is @xmath79 .",
    "a code of @xmath2 qubits that encodes @xmath54 qubits and has distance @xmath78 is denoted @xmath80 $ ] .      the stabilizer formalism can also be used in the context of operator quantum error correction @xcite . instead of being characterized by a stabilizer group ,",
    "subsystem stabilizer codes are almost determined by a subgroup @xmath81 , called the gauge group , such that @xmath82 .",
    "almost because , in addition , a stabilizer group @xmath44 has to be chosen such that @xmath83 , as defined above , is the center of @xmath84 .",
    "there are different choices for @xmath44 because the sign of some of its generators can always be flipped .",
    "this amounts to different choices for @xmath12 in the decomposition @xmath47 .",
    "the idea after the introduction of the gauge group is that gauge operations should not affect the encoded information .",
    "this forces to identify states such as @xmath85 and @xmath86 as equivalent , giving rise to a subsystem structure @xmath87 .",
    "the decomposition is such that the gauge operators @xmath88 act trivially in the @xmath89 subsystems and generate the full algebra of operators of the @xmath90 subsystems .",
    "set @xmath91 , with @xmath92 the logical subsystem where information is encoded and @xmath93 the gauge subsystem that absorbs the effect of gauge operations .",
    "since @xmath94 for some @xmath39 , @xmath93 consists of @xmath39 qubits .",
    "similarly , the pauli operators for the @xmath54 logical qubits are recovered from the isomorphism @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "it is also possible to characterize a stabilizer subsystem code as a triplet @xmath97 , where @xmath63 is an automorphism of @xmath56 and @xmath98 are integers with @xmath99 . using the same notation as above , the stabilizer and gauge groups are @xmath67 and @xmath100 .",
    "the chosen logical pauli operators are @xmath101 .    in subsystem codes",
    "detectable pauli errors are the elements of @xmath72 and undetectable ones are those in @xmath102 .",
    "undetectable errors are directly related to logical pauli operators . indeed , @xmath103 , through the following correspondence .",
    "for any @xmath104 there exists a @xmath105 such that @xmath106 , and if @xmath107 is such that @xmath108 then @xmath109 . the distance @xmath78 of the code is defined as for subspace codes and has the same implications regarding error correction .",
    "a subsystem code of @xmath2 qubits that encodes @xmath54 qubits and has @xmath39 gauge qubits and distance @xmath78 is denoted @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "an interesting property of stabilizer subsystem codes is that they may allow an easier measurement of the stabilizer generators .",
    "this is so because it is possible to substitute the direct measurement of an stabilizer element @xmath111 by an indirect one , in which @xmath112 self - adjoint gauge operators @xmath113 such that @xmath114 are measured",
    ". it may be the case that the @xmath113 have a smaller weight than @xmath111 .",
    "for example , in the family of bacon - shor codes the gauge generators @xmath113 have always weight @xmath115 but the smallest stabilizer generators have an arbitrarily large weight .",
    "such cases offer two important advantages . on the one hand ,",
    "the smaller the weight of a pauli operator , the simpler the operations needed to measure it .",
    "this is specially relevant in fault - tolerant quantum computing , where error correction is considered a faulty process in itself , because simpler operations imply less errors .",
    "secondly , it may be possible to measure the @xmath113 in parallel , with the corresponding saving of time .",
    "this is again relevant for fault tolerance , where the ability to perform measurements faster entails less errors .    since the @xmath113 need not commute the ordering of the measurements is relevant . in general , the ordered measurement of a collection of @xmath112 operators @xmath116 yields the effective measurement of an abelian group of self - adjoint pauli operators @xmath117 , with @xmath118 the center of @xmath119 .",
    "in particular , @xmath120 with @xmath121 the abelian group of those self - adjoint pauli operators with eigenvalues fixed by the sequence of measurements . @xmath121 can be computed iteratively , since adding an additional measurement @xmath122 changes @xmath121 to @xmath123      even if a noisy channels @xmath3 is not correctable for a given subsystem code , there exists some probability of performing a successful error recovery .",
    "for example , if each of the physical qubits that compose a code undergoes a depolarizing channel @xmath124 , then the noise is certainly not correctable , but the success probability can still be close to one .",
    "this section quantifies this probability , which is of primary importance for topological codes @xcite .",
    "some notation is needed here . set as equivalent @xmath125 those operators @xmath126 that have the same action up to gauge elements , @xmath127 for some @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding equivalence classes will be denoted @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be a particular set of representatives for @xmath130 , taking in particular @xmath131 .",
    "the @xmath132 with @xmath133 will represent the ways in which error correction can fail .",
    "for example , if there is one encoded qubit a choice is @xmath134 . to exted the equivalence of operators to channels",
    ", we choose the minimal equivalence relation such that @xmath135 whenever @xmath136 for all @xmath23 .",
    "assume an error model in which pauli errors @xmath36 occur with a given probability @xmath137 .",
    "that is , @xmath138 .",
    "errors with different phases will not be distinguished when discussing @xmath137 because phases are irrelevant . up to gauge operations the error channel is @xmath139 , where @xmath37 denotes any chosen element of @xmath128 and @xmath140 is the probability for a given class of errors to happen .",
    "this makes already apparent that class probabilities @xmath141 are more important than individual error probabilities @xmath137 .",
    "error recovery starts with the measurement of the stabilizer generators @xmath42 .",
    "this yields the error syndrome @xmath53 , which limits the errors @xmath37 that have possibly happened to those with @xmath69 .",
    "these possible errors are arranged into different classes , which may be labeled by choosing any possible error @xmath37 and taking as representatives the elements @xmath142 .",
    "then the conditional probability for the class of errors @xmath128 to have happened given the syndrome outcome @xmath53 is @xmath143 suppose that these conditional probabilities can be computed , which may be potentially difficult due to the combinatorics .",
    "then the class @xmath144 that maximizes @xmath145 is known and the optimal recovery operation is @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the projector onto the subspace @xmath57 .",
    "the combined effect of errors and recovery is @xmath148 for some probabilities @xmath149 that only depend on the error distribution @xmath141 .",
    "this gives a success probability for the error recovery @xmath150    a bad feature of the expression is that it depends on @xmath151 .",
    "consider an alternative error correction procedure where the class of errors with the maximum probability @xmath152 is not always chosen .",
    "instead , an operator from a class @xmath128 is applied with probability @xmath153 , so that @xmath154 . the success probability for this randomized correction procedure is @xmath155 this procedure is at best as successful as the original one , giving the bound @xmath156 .",
    "notice that @xmath157 if and only if @xmath158 .",
    "it follows that @xmath157 if and only if for any @xmath159 @xmath160 this was the condition used in @xcite to characterize successful recovery .",
    "this section gathers together several aspects of topological stabilizer codes to provide a reference for section [ sec : subsystem_topological_codes ] .",
    "the goal is to put the subsystem codes introduced there in a broader context , making apparent the similarities and differences with previously known local and topological codes .      in the context of fault - tolerant quantum computing",
    "it is advantageous to be able to perform the syndrome measurements in a simple way .",
    "it may be desirable , for example , that the number of qubits that form the support of the operators to be measured is small .",
    "similarly , it may be convenient that the qubits that form the code only belong to the support of a small number of such operators .",
    "this ideas can be formalized to give rise to the notion of local families of codes @xcite .",
    "in particular , a family of stabilizer subspace codes @xmath161 is local when i/ it contains codes of arbitrary distance and ii/ there exist two positive integers @xmath162 such that for each @xmath163 there exists a family of generators of the stabilizer @xmath164 such that ii.a/ @xmath165 and ii.b/ the number of @xmath42-s with support on any given qubit is smaller than @xmath166 .",
    "the drawback of such an abstract notion of locality is that it is not related in any way to a particular geometry .",
    "many physical settings have qubits disposed in 1,2 or 3 spatial dimensions and only allow the direct interaction of nearby qubits .",
    "to reflect this fact , and without loss of generality regarding the nature of the lattices , the definition above may be modified as follows @xcite .",
    "first , the qubits of each code @xmath163 are considered to be disposed in the vertices of some finite , periodic , cubic lattice of a given dimension @xmath167 .",
    "second , instead of ii/ there must exist a positive number @xmath78 , independent of @xmath163 , such that the support of all the @xmath42 is contained in some cube containing @xmath168 vertices .",
    "a family of codes that is local in @xmath167 dimensions is always local in the previous sense .",
    "a similar notion of local stabilizer subsystem codes may be defined by substituting the stabilizer with the gauge group .",
    "notice that a family of subsystem codes might have local gauge generators but non - local stabilizer generators , as bacon - shor codes exemplify .",
    "topological stabilizer codes are constructed from lattices on a given manifold , in such a way that the generators of the stabilizer are local with respect to the lattice @xcite .",
    "typically the set of qubits and the set of generators are directly related to sets of geometric objects such as the vertices , links or faces of the lattice . in order to distinguish truly topological codes from merely local ones , we propose the following criterium . _ in a topological stabilizer code , any operator @xmath169 with support in a subset of a region composed of disconnected pieces , each of them simply connected , has trivial action on logical qubits_. stated this way , it is a rather vague criterium since no formal definition of region or connectedness is given .",
    "however , it will be enough for our purposes by adopting a reasonable interpretation when needed .",
    "[ fig : region ] shows an example of a region in a torus that can not be the support of an undetectable error .",
    "an enumeration of the common properties of known topological codes will be useful .",
    "first , the support of undetectable errors is topologically non - trivial in some well - defined way . indeed , both in surface codes @xcite and color codes @xcite undetectable errors are related to homologically non - trivial cycles .",
    "second , and closely related , the number of encoded qubits @xmath54 depends only upon the manifold in which the lattice is defined , and not the lattice itself .",
    "for example , for 2d surface and color codes the number of logical qubits is respectively @xmath170 and @xmath171 , with @xmath172 the euler characteristic of the 2-manifold .",
    "finally , an important property of topological codes is that their nature makes it possible to define them in many different lattices , typically rather arbitrary ones as long as some code dependent constraints are satisfied . in other words ,",
    "topological codes display a huge flexibility .",
    "this is to be expected from constructions that only see the topology , not the geometry , of the manifolds to which they are related .",
    "notice that the locality of the stabilizer generators has been emphasized , with no mention to gauge generators .",
    "the reason is that , up to now , no genuinely subsystem topological codes have been known .",
    "this paper introduces a family of such codes .",
    "they have both local gauge generators and local stabilizer generators .",
    "such locality properties should be expected from any topological subsystem code .",
    "the family of bacon - shor codes @xcite provides an example of non - topological local gauge codes .",
    "these codes certainly do not satisfy the above criterium for any interpretation of connectedness that agrees with their 2d lattice geometry .",
    "moreover , their geometry is completely rigid , in the sense that there is no clear way to generalize them to other lattices and manifolds .",
    "it is interesting to observe that topological codes do not offer good @xmath173 ratios , which go to zero as larger codes are considered . for example , in two - dimensional surface or color codes @xmath174 holds ( which is optimal among 2-dimensional local codes @xcite ) .",
    "but , as remarked in @xcite , this is a misleading point because topological codes can correct most errors of order @xmath175 .",
    "finally , classical topological codes also exist @xcite . unlike quantum ones",
    ", they can be obtained from mere graphs , that is , 1-dimensional objects .      in @xcite an interesting approach to the problem of indefinite preservation of quantum information",
    "was presented that makes use of topological codes .",
    "since it will underly several discussions below , a brief summary is in order .",
    "the main idea is that information is encoded in a surface code and preserved by keeping track of errors . to this end",
    ", round after round of syndrome extractions must be performed .",
    "there are thus two sources of errors , since not only the code will suffer from storage errors but the stabilizer measurements themselves are also faulty .",
    "when the error rate is below certain threshold , the storage time can be made as long as desired by making the code larger , a feature that is only available in topological codes ( for other codes one would have to use concatenation ) .",
    "interestingly , this error threshold can be connected to a phase transition in a classical statistical model , a random 3d gauge model @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of topological codes implies that they can be defined in many lattices .",
    "this feature makes natural the introduction of code deformations @xcite , which are briefly described next .    when two codes are very similar , in the sense that they differ only by a few qubits , it is possible to transform one onto another by manipulating these few qubits .",
    "this is specially natural for local codes that only differ locally . in particular",
    ", such local code deformations will not compromise the protection of the encoded information .",
    "these ideas where first explored in @xcite , where the geometry of a surface code is transformed step by step to compensate a change in the lattice geometry provoked by a transversal gate . in @xcite code deformations are also used to initialize the code with an arbitrary state .",
    "this is done by ` growing ' the code from a single qubit encoding the desired state .",
    "notice that in this case encoded information is not protected on the early stages of the code deformation , when the code is still small .",
    "in general @xcite , two main kinds of deformations may be distinguished : those which change the number of encoded qubits and those which do not .",
    "the formers can be used to initialize and measure encoded qubits , and the latter to perform operations on encoded qubits . in the case of topological codes ,",
    "code deformations amount to changes in the geometry of a lattice , which may ultimately be understood as changes in the geometry of a manifold . when the topology of the manifold changes , initialization or measurement of encoded qubits will happen in a well - defined way @xcite .",
    "when the manifold undergoes a continuous transformation that maps it to itself , a unitary operation is performed on the encoded qubits @xcite . this unitary operation only depends on the isotopy class of the mapping .",
    "code deformation can be naturally integrated with the successive rounds of stabilizer measurements mentioned in the previous section .",
    "in particular , as long as the deformations are local , one can perform them simply by changing the stabilizers to be measured at each stage of error detection @xcite .      in this and",
    "subsequent sections we only consider 2-dimensional topological codes with qubits as their basic elements , because the topological subsystem codes introduced in section iv fall into this category .",
    "for the same reason , subsystem code language , as opposed to subspace , will be used .    in known",
    "2d topological codes the logical pauli operators @xmath176 can be chosen to be string operators @xcite .",
    "these are operators @xmath177 with support along a set of qubits @xmath43 that resembles a closed string .",
    "there are several types of strings , labeled as @xmath178 .",
    "two strings @xmath179 of the same type that enclose a given region , like @xmath180 , @xmath181 in fig .",
    "[ fig : strings ] , give equivalent operators @xmath182 .",
    "in other words , only the homology of the strings is relevant . in particular , boundary strings , those that enclose a region like @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : strings ] , produce operators in @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , @xmath183 is generated by boundary strings of some minimal regions .",
    "when two strings @xmath179 cross once , like @xmath180 and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig : strings ] , @xmath177 and @xmath184 commute or not depending only on the labels of the strings .",
    "finally , two strings @xmath43 , @xmath185 with a common homology class can be combined in a single string @xmath186 of a suitable type , in the sense that @xmath187 .",
    "for example , @xmath78 and @xmath188 in fig .",
    "[ fig : strings ] can be combined in a string @xmath189 of a suitable type .     and",
    "@xmath181 enclose a region and thus are homologically equivalent , producing equivalent operators .",
    "the string @xmath1 encloses a region and thus is homologically trivial , producing a stabilizer element .",
    "the strings @xmath78 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are homologically equivalent but have different labels , producing inequivalent operators.,width=188 ]    all this properties can be captured in a group @xmath190 , for some @xmath112 that depens on the code .",

    "the process is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deformation_b ] .",
    "it follows from the way in which the logical operatorators evolve @xcite that the complete process amount to a controlled phase gate , up to some signs in the final logical operators that depend on the choice of @xmath266 . a cnot gate",

    "in @xcite an interesting connection between error correction thresholds for surface codes and phase transitions in 2d random bond ising models was developed .",
    "similar mappings exist also for color codes @xcite , in this case to 2d random 3-body ising models . in both cases ,",
    "the css structure of these codes is an important ingredient in the constructions : they are subspace codes with @xmath351 in such a way that @xmath352 is generated by products of @xmath353 operators , @xmath354 . to take full profit of this , the noise channel for each qubit must be a composition of a bit - flip channel @xmath355 and a phase flip channel @xmath356 .",
    "there are two main obstacles to construct a similar mapping for the codes @xmath357 .",
    "the first is that they are subsystem codes rather than subspace codes .",
    "the second , that the gauge group can not be separated in a @xmath237 and a @xmath235 part . as we show below , both can be overcome .      rather than directly considering the codes",
    "@xmath229 , this section deals with the general mapping from any given stabilizer subsystem code to a suitable classical statistical model . for simplicity , each qubit in the code",
    "is supposed to be subject to a depolarizing channel @xmath358 , with @xmath359 the error probability , but more general channels are possible within the same framework .    to build the classical hamiltonian model ,",
    "the first step is the choice of a set of generators @xmath360 of @xmath361 .",
    "these generators can be captured in a collection of numbers @xmath362 defined by @xmath363 with @xmath247 , @xmath364 , @xmath365 .",
    "attach a classical ising spin @xmath366 to each of the generators @xmath113 .",

    "the coupling @xmath370 is introduced to follow conventions .",
    "notice that codes with local gauge generators give rise to local hamiltonian models .",

    "@xcite css codes must be considered .",
    "these are codes with @xmath395 for some @xmath396 generated by products of @xmath353 operators , @xmath354 . and",

    "this allows to treat @xmath237 and @xmath235 errors independently @xcite .",
    "here we consider the case of bit flip errors , phase flip errors are analogous .",
    "the construction is similar to the one in the previous section .",
    "it starts with the choice of generators @xmath398 .",

    "the probability of an error @xmath37 that is a product of @xmath237 operators is @xmath402 where @xmath392 is the number of redundant generators of @xmath403 and @xmath404 defines the nishimori temperature @xcite .",
    "bacon - shor codes provides an example of gauge css - like codes . with the above procedure , they yield models that amounts to several copies of the 1d ising model .",
    "interestingly , the redundancy of the generators of @xmath84 is directly connected to the symmetries of the hamiltonians .",
    "suppose that the generators are subject to a constraint of the form @xmath405 for some set of indices @xmath406 .",

    "we now put equation to use in the error correction framework of section [ sec : error_correction ] .",
    "recall that , after the syndrome has been measured , one has to find the most probable class of errors among several candidates @xmath410 .",
    "this amounts to compare the probabilities @xmath411 or , alternatively , the quantities @xmath412 . and to do this , it is enough to know the free energy differences @xcite @xmath413 where @xmath414 is the free energy of a given interaction configuration @xmath377 . for example , in the ising models that appear for 2d surface and color codes",
    "these are domain wall free energies .    in practice",
    ", the computation of may be difficult .",
    "in this regard , it has been suggested @xcite , in the context of surface codes , that in the absence of glassy behavior the computation of should be manageable , and in @xcite a possible approach was sketched .      in surfaces codes there",
    "exists an error probability @xmath415 , the error threshold , such that the asymptotic value of the success probability @xmath416 , in the limit of large code instances , is one for @xmath417 and @xmath418 for @xmath419 @xcite .",
    "this is directly connected to an order - disorder phase transition in a model with random interactions .",
    "an analogous transition is observed for the random model that corresponds to color codes @xcite .",

    "the model has two parameters , the temperature @xmath430 and the probability @xmath359 . for the mapping only a particular line in the @xmath359-@xmath430 plane is relevant , the nishimori line @xcite , given by the condition @xmath431 that has its origin in .",
    "the error correction success probability in can be written in terms of this statistical model as follows : @xmath432_{k_p},\\ ] ] where @xmath433_{k_p } : = \\sum_{\\tau } p(\\tau ) \\,\\cdot$ ] denotes the average over the quenched variables .",
    "suppose that the code has a threshold probability @xmath415 below which @xmath434 in the limit of large codes .",

    "it diverges with the system size below @xmath437 and attains some finite limit over the threshold , signaling an order - disorder phase transition at @xmath415 .",
    "a similar behaviour can be expected for other topological codes . for 2d color codes",
    "this was shown in @xcite .",
    "the above mapping can be immediately applied to the subsystem codes @xmath229 .",
    "choose as generators of the gauge group the edge operators @xmath438 , so that there is an ising spin @xmath439 at each edge @xmath188 .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath440 where the sum runs over vertices and for each of them the ising spins @xmath441 correspond respectively to the @xmath237 , @xmath236 and two @xmath235 edges meeting at the vertex .",
    "the hamiltonian has a local symmetry at each triangle .",
    "in particular , flipping the three ising spins of the triangle leaves @xmath442 invariant .",
    "this is so becuase the product of the three edge operators in the triangle equals the identity .",
    "there exist also a global @xmath443 symmetry that follows from the global constraints in .",
    "the local constraints in do not provide any symmetry as they are trivial in terms of the gauge generators .",
    "the mapping considered up to know is only suitable if perfectly accurate quantum computations are allowed in error correction .",
    "this section generalizes it to include errors in the measurements of the stabilizer generators .",
    "following @xcite , take as a goal the ` indefinite ' preservation of the content of a quantum memory .",
    "time is divided in discrete steps . at each time step",
    ", the memory suffers errors and at the same time the stabilizer generators are imperfectly measured . then if from the history of measurements one can correctly infer the actual history of errors , up to a suitable equivalence , the memory is safe .",
    "the results in @xcite show that for surface codes there exists of a noise threshold below which long time storage is possible for sufficiently large codes .",
    "the same behavior can be expected for other topological codes , but the construction of a suitable random statistical model for each code is required first . here",
    "we generalize the construction of @xcite to subsystem codes and depolarizing channels .",
    "consider first the case of a depolarizing channel @xmath429 occurring for each physical qubit between each round of measurements .",
    "we adopt the convention that at a given time @xmath112 first errors occur and then faulty measurements are performed .",
    "recall that in the mapping of error correction to a statistical model errors were mapped to interactions through the @xmath444 , see .",
    "the new elements here are time and faulty measurements .",
    "since errors can occur at different time steps @xmath112 , a time label must be added to the @xmath444 s to get the collection of signs @xmath445 , subject as before to the constraints @xmath446 . to represent errors in the measurements of stabilizers , first a set @xmath447 of generators of @xmath44 to be measured at each time step @xmath112 must be chosen .",
    "attach to them a collection of signs @xmath448 .",
    "the correct ( wrong ) measurement of the @xmath23-generator at time @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath449 ( @xmath450 ) . in the statistical model the @xmath377 and @xmath451",
    "are quenched variables .",
    "@xmath377 follows the same distribution as before , dependent on the probability @xmath359 , and each @xmath452 is independent an takes value @xmath453 with probability @xmath454 . for this to make sense under the mapping , errors in the measurements must occur independently with a fixed probability @xmath454 .",
    "this will not be true in most settings .",
    "still , it is a useful assumption because knowing the correlations between errors can only improve error correction . in analogy with the @xmath455 defined above , the stabilizer generators are captured in a collection of numbers @xmath456 defined by @xmath457 with @xmath247 , @xmath458 , @xmath365 .",
    "recall also that in the original mapping gauge generators @xmath113 were mapped to ising spins @xmath459 .",
    "the reason for this was that gauge generators play the role of basic equivalences between errors .",
    "now for errors that occur at the same time @xmath112 these kind of equivalence happens again , represented by spins @xmath460 .",
    "but in addition there is an equivalence between errors that involves errors at different time and measurement errors . if at times @xmath112 an @xmath461 a given error occurs and the measurements at time @xmath112 of the stabilizers that would detect the error fail , then these errors altogether go unnoticed but produce no harm .",
    "thus , two collections of errors that differ only by such an event should be considered equivalent .",
    "therefore , ising spins that represent this equivalence are necessary",
    ". this can be achieved by attaching two ising spins @xmath462 to the @xmath112-th time step and @xmath24-th qubit .",
    "the hamiltonians are @xmath463 where @xmath464 and the range of values of the different indices should be clear from the context . in order to recover the probability of a given set of errors from the partition function the relations @xmath465 must hold .    for each time step @xmath112 , the hamiltonians",
    "keep the symmetries .",
    "in addition , there is a symmetry for each gauge generator @xmath466 and time @xmath467 .",
    "namely , @xmath468 therefore , local gauge generators give rise to a ( random ) gauge model .",
    "finally , consider the simpler case of a bit flip channel @xmath469 in a css - like code .",
    "as noted above , the case of a phase flip channel is analogous and if both channels happen consecutively they can be treated independently .",
    "the construction is an extension of the one in section [ sec : css_stat ] .",
    "the @xmath470 s and @xmath459 are respectively replaced by the signs @xmath471 and the ising spins @xmath460 .",
    "given a choice of generators @xmath472 to be measured at each time step , there is a corresponding collection of signs @xmath473 .",
    "the generators take the form @xmath474 for some @xmath475 .",
    "there is also an ising spin @xmath476 for each physical qubit @xmath24 and time step @xmath112 .",
    "the hamiltonians read @xmath477 instead of , the right conditions are now @xmath478 the analog of is @xmath479",
    "topological codes are intrinsically local , and gauge or subsystem codes can have interesting locality properties . in this paper we have introduced a family of topological subsystem codes , thus putting together the two concepts . the gauge group of the code is generated by 2-local operators , which compares well with surface or color codes that have at least 4-local and 6-local generators , respectively .",
    "in particular , the measurement of these 2-local operators is enough to recover the error syndrome .",
    "we have argued that these codes do not allow the introduction of boundaries with nice properties , which motivates further research .",
    "there are probably interesting topological codes still to be discovered .",
    "one could look for example for subsystem codes with nice boundaries or with interesting transversality properties as those found in color codes .",
    "we have also explored a general connection between error correction in subsystem codes and statistical physics .",
    "the connection is specially meaningful in the case of topological codes , where the error threshold maps to a phase transition in the corresponding statistical model .",

    "the construction is the following .",

    "let @xmath489 be the collection of those sets of triangles that have an even number of triangles meeting at each vertex .",
