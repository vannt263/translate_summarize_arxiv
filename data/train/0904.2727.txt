    "these divergences are associated with the particular features of the light - cone gauge ( or the use of purely lightlike wilson lines ) that must be removed by some consistent method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for instance , they can be avoided by using non - lightlike gauge links in covariant gauges , or by employing an axial gauge , but going off - the - light - cone @xcite .",

    "2 vanishes as well , entailing @xmath118 . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution arising from real gluons , @xmath119 , does not contain uv - singularities .",
    "hence , @xmath120 reduces to unity , excluding the appearance of any contribution to the anomalous dimension of the tmd pdf related to spurious rapidity divergences .",

    "( [ eq : tmd_re - definition ] ) also for the case of the light - cone gauge with the ml - prescription .",
    "further , the anomalous dimension of the modified tmd pdf ( [ eq : tmd_re - definition ] ) coincides , therefore , with the anomalous dimension of the standard tmd pdf ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : tmd_naive ] ) ) in the light - cone gauge with the ml - prescription .",
    "consequently , the renormalization - group properties of the tmd pdf are controlled by the following evolution equation @xmath121 where the anomalous dimension coincides with the standard expression , i.e. , @xmath122",
    "this work was devoted to the treatment of mixed rapidity divergences of fully gauge - invariant tmd pdfs when employing the light - cone gauge in conjunction with the mandelstam - leibbrandt pole prescription .",
    "to this end , we calculated the leading - order contributions to the tmd pdf ensuing from virtual gluon corrections .",
    "exactly these terms contain the uv singularities of the tmd pdf and thereby entail its anomalous dimension .",
    "we have shown by explicit calculation at one loop that , in contrast to other popular pole prescriptions , like the advanced , retarded , or the principal - value one , the mandelstam - leibbrandt prescription possesses the important property that spurious mixed rapidity divergences , related to obstructions of the gauge contour , are absent .",
    "correspondingly , the soft factor , we introduced in @xcite in order to ensure the cancelation of such artifacts to the anomalous dimension of the tmd pdf , reduces in this case to unity , thus preserving its validity .",
    "phenomenologically , the use of the ml pole prescription in the light - cone gauge will facilitate calculations of tmd pdfs in a factorized description of sidis cross sections because the contributions to the anomalous dimensions from gauge - contour obstructions in the wilson lines of the tmd pdfs cancel out , making the insertion of a correcting soft factor superfluous right from the start .",
    "this is also reflected in the evolution behavior of the tmd pdfs which is controlled by the standard anomalous dimension one finds in a covariant gauge , where anomalous - dimension artifacts are manifestly absent because factorization is complete like in collinear factorization .",
    "these aspects and the practical analysis of their applications will be considered in more detail elsewhere .",
