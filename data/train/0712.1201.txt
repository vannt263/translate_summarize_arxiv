    "<S> motivated by the description of the graphene electronic structure in terms of the relativistic dirac equation , a generalization to four dimensions yields a strictly local fermion action describing two species and possessing an exact chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is the minimum number of species required by the well known `` no - go '' theorems .    </S>",
    "<S> the structure of graphene , a single layer of graphite consisting of a hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms , has attracted considerable attention recently both from the experimental front and the fact that the low electronic excitations are described by the dirac equation for massless fermions @xcite . from the point of view of a particle physicist , this structure has two particularly striking features . </S>",
    "<S> first , the massless structures are robust for topological reasons related to chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> second , it achieves this symmetry in a manner that involves the minimum number of effective massless fermions required by the famous `` no - go theorems '' for lattice chiral symmetry @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> given the importance of chiral symmetry in particle physics and the difficulties with implementing it with a lattice regularization @xcite , it is natural to ask whether these properties of the graphene electronic structure can be extended to four dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this is possible , and provides a remarkable fermion action with an exact chiral symmetry and manifesting two species of massless states , the minimal number consistent with chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this action is strictly local and thus will be vastly faster in simulations than either the overlap operator or domain wall fermions , the only other known ways to have chiral symmetry with only two flavors .    </S>",
    "<S> recently a chiral gauge theory structure on two dimensional graphene has been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given that we do not yet have a lattice regularization of the standard model , it would be particularly interesting if this construction could be extended to the four dimensional lattices presented here .    </S>",
    "<S> although well known , it is useful to review briefly the standard two - dimensional graphene band structure . </S>",
    "<S> we will closely parallel this derivation for the four - dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> ignored here are all but the pi orbitals in a tight binding approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we also ignore the electron spin , each component of which gives an equivalent structure . </S>",
    "<S> our electrons hop from neighbor to neighbor around a fixed underlying hexagonal lattice . </S>",
    "<S> a fortuitous choice of coordinates makes the problem straightforward to solve . as sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ graphenefig ] ) , orient a graphene surface with one third of the bonds horizontal , one third sloping up at 60 degrees , and one third sloping down . </S>",
    "<S> it is then convenient to collapse the atoms at the opposite ends of each horizontal bond together and call this unit a lattice `` site , '' as enclosed in ellipses in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> for each site , let @xmath0 denote the creation operator for an electron on the left atom , and correspondingly let @xmath1 create an electron on the right atom . </S>",
    "<S> the commutation relations are the usual @xmath2_+ = [ b_{x_1,x_2},b^\\dagger_{x_1^\\prime , x_2^\\prime}]_+ = \\delta_{x_1,x_1^\\prime}\\delta_{x_2,x_2^\\prime}\\ ] ] with the @xmath3 type operators anti - commuting with the @xmath4 s . finally , it is useful to label the sites using a non - orthogonal coordinate system with axes @xmath5 sloping up at 30 degrees intersecting the corresponding sites , and similarly @xmath6 sloping down at 30 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> all of this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ graphenefig ] ) .        with these conventions , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of interest involves only nearest neighbor hoppings between @xmath3 and @xmath4 type sites @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the basic hopping parameter . the phase of @xmath8 is a convention ; here i consider positive real hopping . </S>",
    "<S> to diagonalize this hamiltonian go to momentum space @xmath9 this brings the hamiltonian to the simple form @xmath10 the problem reduces to diagonalizing a two by two matrix of form @xmath11 with @xmath12 the energy eigenvalues are @xmath13 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ threeterms ] ) it is easy to see that the energy vanishes only at two points , @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> these are known as `` fermi points '' @xcite and their robustness can be seen by considering contours of constant energy . </S>",
    "<S> these are closed curves of constant @xmath15 in @xmath16 space . </S>",
    "<S> the important point is that for such a contour near one of the zero energy solutions , the phase of @xmath17 wraps non - trivially around a circle . </S>",
    "<S> this non - contractable mapping indicates that on reducing the energy and shrinking the curve to a point , the magnitude of the energy at this point must vanish . </S>",
    "<S> this is the mechanism that prevents a band gap from opening in the spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> this robustness is associated with a chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> because the hoppings are always between @xmath3 and @xmath4 type sites , we can change the sign of the energy by taking @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to the statement that @xmath19 anti - commutes with the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> for the four - dimensional generalization , this will become the anti - commutation of @xmath20 with the dirac operator .    </S>",
    "<S> we wish to extend this formalism to the four - dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> we want an operator @xmath21 to insert into the euclidian path integral via the fermion action @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> for low energy excitations this operator should reduce to two massless dirac fermions , and this reduction should be robust due to a chiral symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> essentially all dirac operators used in practice for lattice gauge theory satisfy what is called a `` @xmath20 hermiticity '' condition @xmath23 where @xmath20 is the usual four by dirac matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it is hermitean and squares to the unit matrix . a specific realization of this and the other dirac matrices will appear below . using this </S>",
    "<S> we can construct a hermitean `` hamiltonian '' @xmath24 with which we will parallel the two dimensional discussion . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to remember that this is not the hamiltonian of the three dimensional quantum system , but a convenient operator for leading us back to @xmath21 . in four - dimensional space , </S>",
    "<S> the analog of the curves of constant `` energy '' are three dimensional manifolds . to maintain a topological argument in analogy to the two dimensional case , we want to consider the situation where these surfaces wrap non - trivially around a three sphere , an @xmath25 . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> it is quite natural to maintain the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hmatrix ] ) , but extend @xmath17 to two by two matrices in a quaternionic space . </S>",
    "<S> that is , take @xmath26 with @xmath27 a real four vector and @xmath28 denotes the traditional pauli matrices . with @xmath17 being a two by two matrix inserted into the two by two matrix of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hmatrix ] ) , we wind up with a four by four matrix , the same dimension as used in the usual dirac equation . as before , vanishing energy states occur when @xmath17 vanishes , which now corresponds to @xmath27 vanishing as a four vector . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to construct our hamiltonian so that that constant energy surfaces that wrap around zero energy points within the brillouin zone will involve a non - trivial mapping in the quaternionic space . </S>",
    "<S> because of the periodicity of the brillouin zone , these zero energy points must appear in pairs so that the overall wrapping will vanish . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this is the famous no - go theorem @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we want a construction giving precisely one and only one such pair . </S>",
    "<S> we also want to involve only local couplings , i.e. with only simple trigonometric functions of the momenta appearing in the dispersion relations . because of the robustness of the zeros , if such a construction exists , it is clearly not unique . to find one such solution , </S>",
    "<S> start with a regular four - dimensional lattice and perform a fourier transform . </S>",
    "<S> now there will be four momentum variables @xmath29 , all ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . a convenient form to explore </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are parameters whose values will be discussed later .    for zero energy states </S>",
    "<S> we need @xmath17 to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> this gives four equations corresponding to the coefficients of 1 and each @xmath35 vanishing . from the coefficients of the pauli matrices </S>",
    "<S> imply the sines of all the momentum components must be equal . </S>",
    "<S> picking @xmath36 arbitrarily , each other @xmath37 must either equal @xmath36 or @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> now turning to the constant part of @xmath17 , we have @xmath39 since the cosine function is bounded by unity , we clearly must take @xmath40 to have any solutions . to resolve the @xmath41 ambiguity </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to ask that @xmath42 be positive . imposing the constraint @xmath43 ensures this . </S>",
    "<S> we will later discuss some interesting specific choices for @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> so with these constraints on the constant @xmath34 there are exactly two zeros of energy in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> these occur when all components of @xmath44 are equal and satisfy @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the two solutions differ in the sign of @xmath44 . picking the positive sign for convenience , it is useful to expand about the zero @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 . defining @xmath49 we have @xmath50 inserting all this into our quaternion @xmath51 this two by two matrix is to be inserted into the analogue of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hmatrix ] ) to otain a four by four matrix . at this point </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a convention for the dirac gamma matrices @xmath52 the direct product notation here is defined so that @xmath20 is diagonal with @xmath53 in the last two places . with these conventions </S>",
    "<S> our euclidean dirac operator takes the form @xmath54 this reproduces the desired massless dirac equation if we identify new momenta @xmath55 proper lorentz invariance requires symmetry between the @xmath56 s . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the original lattice , as generated by translations using the @xmath57 s , will in general be distorted from simple hyper - cubic .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical angles between the original lattice directions are easily determined . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a step along the @xmath58 axis represents a shift in the @xmath59 basis by @xmath60 while going along the @xmath61 axis gives @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> these vectors are at the angle @xmath63 to each other .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the original axes can be made orthogonal by setting @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> with such a choice , gauging the theory is straightforward . because the starting links are orthogonal </S>",
    "<S> , we can use the usual wilson gauge action with group elements on links interacting with the simple plaquette action . </S>",
    "<S> borici @xcite has recently suggested using @xmath65 and @xmath66 as a particularly simple case with orthogonal axes .    another especially interesting choice for the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 gives a closer analogy with graphene . </S>",
    "<S> imagine the fermion fields on one site to actually be spread along a new bond connecting two atoms in the @xmath67 direction , similar to the construction for graphene indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ graphenefig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this structure would be particularly symmetric if the angles between all five bonds attached to an atom were equal in length and distributed at a common angle to each other .    to construct this structure </S>",
    "<S> it is simplest to look in momentum space continued beyond the first brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the zeros of the energy then form a lattice on which we wish to impose the above symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to consider one zero and ask that the five closest ones are equally distant in the physically scaled momentum units and at angles from each other satisfying @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , ask that the physical four vector between the two zeros at @xmath69 and @xmath70 be of the same physical length as the vector from the first of these to the repetition of the second when any one of the four components of @xmath44 is increased by @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a set of five four vectors , which should be symmetrically distributed in four space . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions on lengths and angles then determines the parameters as @xmath72    this lattice of zeros has an appealing intuitive geometric interpretation in terms of bonds along one direction , analogous to the horizontal bonds in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ graphenefig ] ) , splitting at a site into four bonds going off symmetrically into four - space . </S>",
    "<S> these then join a repetition of this structure with new horizontal bonds displaced in the various directions . while in two dimensional graphene each carbon is coupled symmetrically to three neighbors , here each atom </S>",
    "<S> is directly coupled to 5 others . </S>",
    "<S> the entire lattice is then built up of hexagonal chairs with an inter - bond angle of @xmath73 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> note that the diamond lattice in three dimensions represents an intermediate case , where one bond splits into three giving each atom a tetrahedral environment .    </S>",
    "<S> this lattice has a 120 element discrete symmetry group under permutations of the five neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> the specific action chosen here , however , selects the @xmath67 direction as special from the way it appears in the site diagonal term . because of this </S>",
    "<S> , the full action is not exactly invariant under the full 120 element group , but only a 24 element subgroup of rotations and inversions that leave invariant the positive diagonal of the initial hypercubic structure defined by the @xmath57 axes . </S>",
    "<S> this tetrahedral symmetry , which is that of the three dimensional diamond lattice , applies for all valid values of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 and includes 12 parity odd operations . </S>",
    "<S> considering the time axis to run along this positive diagonal , there is in addition a symmetry under reflections about a spacelike surface perpendicular to this time axis accompanied by a rotation to bring the bonds back into alignment </S>",
    "<S> . these symmetries will eliminate many possible lattice artifacts and constrain operator mixing in renormalization studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main remaining issue is that the special treatment of time still allows a renormalization of the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> this can be compensated by adding to the gauge action terms involving six link chairs orthogonal to the time direction . while such terms are generally necessary , for the hyper - cubic values @xmath74 they should go to zero in the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , these are all issues of order the lattice spacing squared , as discussed in @xcite .    from the standpoint of computational efficiency , it does not appear to matter much what values of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen , within the constraint @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> near the limits of this range one should expect lattice artifacts to increase . </S>",
    "<S> the hyper - cubic values @xmath74 are presumably closest to conventional lattice gauge ideas and simplest to gauge , with only a traditional plaquette action required . on the other hand , the values in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ symmetric ] ) may have smaller lattice artifacts due to the high symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> returning from reciprocal to position space , the fermionic action involves several terms . </S>",
    "<S> first from the collapsed @xmath67 bond there is a site diagonal term @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> then for a forward step in the various directions we pick up a factor of the hopping parameter @xmath8 multiplied by different combinations of gamma matrices , as listed here : @xmath77 keeping the operator @xmath21 anti - hermitean , the reverse hops involve minus the conjugate of these factors . </S>",
    "<S> note the factor of @xmath78 in front of @xmath79 which is absent for the @xmath80 terms . </S>",
    "<S> this twisting of the phase gives rise to the required factors of @xmath81 or @xmath82 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this action is only marginally more complicated than that of naive fermions ; so , it should be easy to insert into simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry is manifested in the exact anti - commutation of @xmath20 with @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this is actually a flavored chiral symmetry since the expansion about the negative solution for @xmath44 flips the sign of the gamma matrix associated with @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> note that as with naive fermions , @xmath21 is purely anti - hermitean . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral symmetry can easily be broken with the addition of a term proportional to @xmath20 to @xmath84 that splits the degeneracy of the type @xmath3 and type @xmath4 sites . </S>",
    "<S> this gives each physical fermion a common mass . because the chiral symmetry remains exact on gauging , an additive renormalization for the physical fermion mass is forbidden , unlike with wilson fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the further addition of a wilson type mass term would enable splitting the degeneracy of the two species . note that if we wish to extend this formalism to more flavors , the no - go theorem restricts us to an even number of species . </S>",
    "<S> the best we can do for three flavors is to start with four and , using a chiral symmetry breaking operator , make one of the flavors heavier . </S>",
    "<S> such a term will unfortunately introduce the possibility of an additive mass renormalization for the third flavor .    </S>",
    "<S> it is perhaps interesting to compare this formalism with staggered fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter also have an exact chiral symmetry and the appearance of several degenerate flavors ( sometimes called tastes to distinguish them from independent lattice fields ) . in both formalisms </S>",
    "<S> the chiral symmetry is flavored , with the different species rotating differently under a chiral rotation . </S>",
    "<S> also , in both cases mixing between the flavors will result in the zero modes associated with topologically non - trivial gauge fields to no longer be exact at finite lattice spacing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the usual staggered approach has the doublers appearing in multiples of four , and thus is further from the situation desired for the physical case with only the light up and down quarks . </S>",
    "<S> staggered fermions do have only one component of the field per site , yielding potentially faster simulations at the expense of an intricate non - local formalism in constructing composite fields . </S>"
