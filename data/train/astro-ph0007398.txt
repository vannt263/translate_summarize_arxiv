    "recent deep radio surveys ( @xmath9 mjy ) have shown that normalized radio source counts flatten below a few mjy .",
    "this has been interpreted as being due to a new population which does not show up at higher fluxes where counts are dominated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . to clarify its nature",
    "it is necessary to get detailed information on the radio properties of normal galaxies in the nearby universe ( z @xmath10 0.15 ) , down to faint flux limits and to have at hand large samples of mjy and sub - mjy sources , for subsequent optical identification and spectroscopic work . to this end",
    "we have surveyed a large area ( @xmath11 26 sq .",
    "degr ) with the atca at 1.4 ghz with a bandwidth of @xmath12 mhz .",
    "the properties of normal nearby galaxies can be easily derived , because this area coincides with the region in which the esp redshift survey was conducted ( vettolani et al .",
    "samples of faint galaxies over large areas are necessary to avoid bias due to local variations in their properties .",
    "present samples of faint radio sources are confined to small regions with insufficient source statistics .",
    "+ the present paper contains the radio source catalogue derived from the atesp survey . the full outline of the radio survey , its motivation in comparison with other surveys , and the description of the mosaic observing technique which was used to obtain an optimal combination of uniform and high sensitivity over the whole area has been presented in prandoni et al .",
    "( 2000 , paper i ) .",
    "the source counts derived from the atesp survey will be presented and discussed separately in a following paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec - det ] we describe the source detection and parameterization ; the catalogue is described in sect .",
    "[ sec - cat ] and the accuracy of the parameters ( flux densities , sizes and positions ) are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec - errors ] .",
    "the atesp survey consists of 16 radio mosaics with spatial resolution @xmath0 .",
    "the survey was designed so as to provide uniform sensitivity over the whole region ( @xmath4 sq .",
    "degrees ) of the esp redshift survey . to achieve this goal",
    "a larger area was observed , but we have excluded from the analysis the external regions ( where the noise is not uniform and increases radially ) . in the region with uniform sensitivity the noise level varies from 69 @xmath3jy to 88 @xmath3jy , depending on the radio mosaic , with an average of 79 @xmath3jy ( see @xmath13 values reported in table  3 of paper i and repeated also in table  [ tab - mospar ] of appendix  [ sec - appb ] , at the end of this paper ) . for consistency with paper",
    "i , in the following such sensitivity average values are denoted by the symbol @xmath13 .",
    "this means that sensitivity values have been defined as the _ full width at half maximum _ ( fwhm ) of the gaussian that fits the pixel flux density distribution in each mosaic ( see paper i for more details ) .",
    "+ a number of source detection and parameterization algorithms are available , which were developed for deriving catalogues of components from radio surveys .",
    "we decided to use the algorithm _ image search and destroy _ ( imsad ) available as part of the _ multichannel image reconstruction , image analysis and display _ ( miriad ) package ( sault & killeen @xcite ) , as it is particularly suited to images obtained with the atca .",
    "+ imsad selects all the connected regions of pixels ( _ islands _ ) above a given flux density threshold .",
    "the _ islands _ are the sources ( or the source components ) present in the image above a certain flux limit .",
    "then imsad performs a two - dimensional gaussian fit of the _ island _ flux distribution and provides the following parameters : position of the centroid ( right ascension , @xmath14 , and declination , @xmath15 ) , peak flux density ( @xmath16 ) , integrated flux density ( @xmath17 ) , fitted angular size ( major , @xmath18 , and minor , @xmath19 , fwhm axes , not deconvolved for the beam ) and position angle ( p.a . ) .",
    "+ imsad proved to have an average success rate of @xmath20 down to very faint flux levels ( see below ) . since imsad attempts to fit a single gaussian to each _ island _ , it obviously tends to fail ( or to provide very poor source parameters ) when fitting complex ( _ i.e. _ non - gaussian ) shapes .",
    "we used imsad to extract and parameterize all the sources and/or components in the uniform sensitivity region of each mosaic .",
    "as a first step , a preliminary list containing all detections with @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the average mosaic rms flux density ) was extracted .",
    "detection thresholds vary from 0.3 mjy to 0.4 mjy , depending on the radio mosaic .",
    "we visually inspected all _ islands _ ( @xmath23 ) detected , in order to check for obvious failures and/or possibly poor parameterization , that need further analysis .",
    "problematic cases were classified as follows :    * _ islands _ for which the automated algorithm provides poor parameters and therefore are to be re - fitted with a single gaussian , constraining in a different way the initial conditions ( @xmath24 of the total ) . * _ islands _ that could be better described by two or more split gaussian components ( @xmath25 of the total ) ; * _ islands _ which can not be described by a single or multiple gaussian fit ( @xmath26 of the total ) ; * _ islands _ corresponding to obviously unreal sources , typically noise peaks and/or image artifacts in noisy regions of the images ( @xmath27 of the total ) ;    the goodness of gaussian fit parameters was checked by comparing them with reference values , defined as follows . positions and peak flux densities were compared to the corresponding values derived by a second - degree interpolation of the _ island_. such interpolation usually provides very accurate positions and peak fluxes .",
    "gaussian integrated fluxes were compared to the ones derived directly by summing pixel per pixel the flux density in the source area , defined as the region enclosed by the @xmath28 flux density contour .",
    "flux densities were considered good whenever the difference between the gaussian and the reference value @xmath29 was @xmath30 .",
    "positions were considered good whenever they did fall within the @xmath31 flux contour .",
    "for the first three groups listed above _ ad hoc _ procedures were attempted aimed at improving the fit .",
    "+ single - component fits were considered satisfactory whenever positions and flux densities satisfy the tolerance criteria defined above .",
    "+ in a few cases gaussian fits were able to provide good values for positions and peak flux densities , but did fail in determining the integrated flux densities .",
    "this happens typically at faint fluxes ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "gaussian sources with a poor @xmath17 value are flagged in the catalogue ( see sect .  [ sec - cformat ] ) .",
    "+ the _ islands _ successfully split in two or three components are 67 in total ( 64 with two components and 3 with three components ) .",
    "+ for non - gaussian sources we adopted as parameters the reference positions and flux densities defined above .",
    "the source position angle was determined by the direction in which the source is most extended and the source axes were defined as _ largest angular sizes _ ( _ las _ ) , i.e. the maximum distance between two opposite points belonging to the @xmath33 flux density contour along ( major axis ) and perpendicular to ( minor axis ) the same direction .",
    "all the non - gaussian sources are flagged in the catalogue ( see sect .  [ sec - cformat ] ) .",
    "the procedures described in the previous section yielded a preliminary list of sources ( or source components ) for further investigation . in order to minimize the incompleteness effects present at fluxes approaching the source extraction threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - fluxhist ] ) we decided to insert in the final catalogue only the sources with @xmath34 , where @xmath22 is the mosaic rms flux density .",
    "this threshold has been chosen after inspection of the local noise distribution .",
    "the local noise ( @xmath35 ) has been defined as the average noise value in a box of about @xmath36 size around a source .",
    "usually the local noise does not show significant systematic departures from the mosaic average rms value : the @xmath37 distribution can be described fairly well by a gaussian with @xmath38 and peak value equal to 1.01 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - lrmshist ] ) . +",
    "this can be seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig - lrms ] , where we show , for each source , the signal - to - noise ratio defined using both @xmath35 and @xmath13 .",
    "the two signal - to - noise ratios mostly agree with each other , although a number of significant departures are evident for the faintest sources .",
    "this is due to the presence of some residual areas where the noise is not random due to systematic effects ( noise peaks and stripes ) .",
    "this is caused by the limited dynamical range in presence of very strong sources ( stronger than @xmath39 mjy , see also paper i ) .",
    "it is worth noting that also the systematic departures from the expected behavior at the brightest end of the plot ( @xmath40 ) are a consequence of the same problem .",
    "+ in mosaic regions where local noise is significantly larger , we applied a @xmath41 cut - off if @xmath42 ( assuming a normal distribution for the noise , the probability to get a local to average noise value @xmath43 is @xmath44 ) .",
    "this resulted in the rejection of 32 sources ( see the region in fig .",
    "[ fig - lrms ] defined by @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . + the criteria discussed above proved to be very effective in selecting out noise artifacts from the catalogue .",
    "nevertheless a few ( 6 ) sources , which satisfy both the average and the local noise constraints are , however , evident noise artifacts at visual inspection .",
    "such objects have been rejected from the final catalogue .",
    "+ the adopted criteria for the final catalogue definition also allowed us to significantly reduce the number of poor gaussian fits ( see sect .",
    "[ sec - refit ] ) since a large fraction of them ( @xmath48 ) have fainter @xmath16 : we are left with 50 poor gaussian fits ( flagged _ ` s * ' _ , see sect .",
    "[ sec - cformat ] ) in the final catalogue . + a total number of 3172 source components entered the final catalogue .",
    "some of them have to be considered different components of a unique source and , as discussed later in sect .",
    "[ sec - mult ] , the number of distinct sources in the atesp catalogue is 2960 .      the ratio of the integrated flux to the peak flux is a direct measure of the extension of a radio source : @xmath49 where @xmath19 and @xmath18 are the source fwhm axes and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the synthesized beam fwhm axes .",
    "the flux ratio can therefore be used to discriminate between extended ( larger than the beam ) and point - like sources .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ fig - stspratio ] we have plotted the flux ratio as a function of the signal - to - noise for all the sources ( or source components ) in the atesp catalogue . the flux density ratio has a skew distribution , with a tail towards high flux ratios due to extended sources .",
    "values for @xmath52 are due to the influence of the image noise on the measure of source sizes ( see sect .  [ sec - errors ] ) . to establish a criterion for extension , such errors have to be taken into account .",
    "we have determined the lower envelope of the flux ratio distribution ( the curve containing 90% of the @xmath53 sources ) and we have mirrored it on the @xmath54 side ( upper envelope in fig .",
    "[ fig - stspratio ] ) . we have considered as unresolved all sources laying below the upper envelope .",
    "the upper envelope can be characterized by the equation : @xmath55   \\ ; .\\ ] ] from this analysis we found that 1864 of the 3172 sources ( or source components ) in the catalogue ( i.e. @xmath56 ) have to be considered unresolved . + it is worth noting that the envelope does not converge to 1 going to large signal - to - noise values .",
    "this is due to the radial smearing effect .",
    "it systematically reduces the source peak fluxes , yielding larger @xmath57 ratios ( see discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec - corr ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig - stspratio ] we can quantify the smearing effect in @xmath24 on average . + deconvolved angular sizes are given in the catalogue only for sources above the upper curve ( filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig - stspratio ] ) . for unresolved sources ( dots in fig .",
    "[ fig - stspratio ] ) deconvolved angular sizes are set to zero .",
    "+ note that no bandwidth correction to deconvolved sizes has been applied .",
    "correcting for such effect would be somewhat complicated by the fact that each source in the radio mosaics is a sum of contributions from several single pointings .      in fig .",
    "[ fig - doubles ] the ( nearest neighbor ) pair density distribution is shown as a function of distance ( histogram )",
    ". also indicated is the expected distribution if all the sample sources ( components ) were randomly distributed in the sky .",
    "the expected distribution has been scaled so as to have the same area below the curve and the observed histogram .",
    "the excess at small distances is clearly due to physical associations and , because of the normalization chosen , is compensated by a deficiency at larger distances ( between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) . +",
    "all the components closer than @xmath60 ( _ i.e. _ about three times the beam size ) have been considered as possibly belonging to a unique double source .",
    "triple sources are defined whenever one additional component is closer than @xmath60 to ( at least ) one of the pair components . for multiple sources the same criterion",
    "is applied iteratively . applying this distance constraint",
    "we expect that @xmath61 of the pairs are random superpositions .",
    "+ the flux ratio distribution between the pair components has a large spread at all distances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - fratio ] ) . to reduce the contamination",
    "we have discarded all the pairs with flux ratio larger than a factor 10 . for triples and multiple sources the probable core",
    "is not considered when computing the flux ratios .",
    "+ a few departures from the adopted criteria are present in the catalogue .",
    "for example the triple source atesp j005620 - 394145 and the double source atesp j011029 - 393253",
    "have @xmath62 but do not satisfy the flux ratio constraint .",
    "all exceptions are based on source geometry considerations and/or the analysis of the source field .",
    "+ in order to increase the multiple sources sub - sample completeness , we added 31 sources with distances @xmath63 , which show clear signs of physical associations between their components ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - examples ] for some examples ) .",
    "no flux ratio constraints have been applied to such sources . in fig .",
    "[ fig - fratio ] are shown the flux ratios for all the pairs in the final sample of multiple sources ( filled circles ) . + as a final result we have 189 multiple sources : 168 doubles , 19 triples and 2 sources with four components . as a consequence , the initial list of 3172 radio components results in a catalogue of 2960 distinct radio sources .",
