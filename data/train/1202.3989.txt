    "in the last decades much effort has been put into understanding and modelling non - equilibrium systems , which find applications in fields ranging from biology to finance @xcite . among the various models which have been proposed to study such real - life processes , stochastic interacting particle systems ( interacting markov systems )",
    "have enjoyed particular success @xcite . in this class ,",
    "the zero - range process ( zrp ) is a well studied lattice gas model offering many applications and the possibility of obtaining analytical results",
    ". introduced in 1970 @xcite , one of the reasons the zrp gained interest was because it can show a phase transition from a fluid to a condensed state @xcite .",
    "the zrp has been extensively studied with both periodic and open boundary conditions in one dimension @xcite , and some variants involving junction topologies have also been introduced , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , currents in a closely related model have recently been considered on more general networks @xcite , which may give some insight into expected effects for manmade networks such as traffic on roads or the internet .",
    "+ for extended zrps defined on two - dimensional or three - dimensional lattices , particle currents can flow in principle in loops within the bulk of the system . to illustrate this possibility , we study a simple variant of the zrp defined on a diamond - shaped lattice with open boundaries . for this model",
    ", we are able to obtain analytical expressions for the mean current flowing between specific sites of the lattice which show that the model has two regimes of mean particle currents : a unidirectional regime where particles flow in the same direction through different lattice branches and a loop current regime where the mean current flows around the diamond .",
    "the analysis is also extended to a chain of coupled diamonds where , for a weak asymmetry of the bulk hopping rates , we find a transition between unidirectional and loop current regimes persisting in the large - system - size limit . + in addition to mean currents , we also study fluctuations by calculating the probability distribution of particle currents and its associated large deviation rate function , which plays a role similar to thermodynamic potentials in equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "recently much experimental and theoretical attention has been devoted to the study of certain fluctuation symmetries @xcite , which may also be observed experimentally , e.g. @xcite .",
    "our simple model allows us to study explicitly the joint probability of observing a given current on different lattice branches .",
    "we obtain analytically the large deviation functions for currents across different bonds and hence gain understanding of the role of current loops .",
    "these results for current loops , which are difficult to obtain for general models , are expected to be important in testing fluctuation symmetries for higher dimensional systems , such as those reported recently by hurtado et al .",
    "+ the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "s : model ] , we define the zrp on the diamond lattice and calculate its stationary state . in section [ s : currentloops ] , we discuss the appearance of unidirectional and loop mean current regimes in the system . in section [",
    "s : currentfluct ] , we calculate the joint particle current fluctuations of the upper and lower branches of the lattice and test the well known gallavotti - cohen fluctuation relation for partial and total currents . in section [ s : diamondchain ]",
    "we use our approach to analyse a chain of diamonds .",
    "finally , in section [ s : conclusion ] , we discuss our results and their possible implications for other models .",
    "the zrp is a lattice - based many - particle model in which , as the name suggests , particles interact only with other particles at the same site .",
    "additionally , particles are allowed to accumulate to any non - negative number on each site of the lattice . here , we study the zrp with open boundary conditions on a diamond lattice as shown in figure [ diaarr ] .",
    "+    s represent the fugacities of sites 14 .",
    "the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the hopping rates . ]    the dynamics of the particles on this lattice is defined in continuous time such that the topmost particle on each site hops to an adjacent site after an exponentially distributed waiting time .",
    "more precisely , particles hop clockwise around the diamond with rate @xmath6 and anti - clockwise with rate @xmath7 , where the interaction between particles on each site is taken into account by the term @xmath8 which depends exclusively on the occupation number @xmath9 of the departure site . given the symmetry of the system , without loss of generality we will assume from now on that @xmath10 moreover , we allow particles to enter and leave the boundary sites with probability rates @xmath0 and @xmath11 for site 1 , @xmath2 and @xmath12 for site 3 .",
    "+ based on the one - dimensional open boundary zrp studied in @xcite we expect the system to be driven out of equilibrium for @xmath13 but that some choices of parameters may lead to a boundary condensation phenomenon in which particles accumulate on one of the sites 1 or 3 .",
    "we shall return to this point later .",
    "+ in the quantum hamiltonian formalism @xcite , one defines a probability vector @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a basis vector for the particle configuration @xmath16 and @xmath17 the probability of that configuration .",
    "then the time evolution of the system is described by the master equation @xmath18 here the matrix @xmath19 , or hamiltonian , is the stochastic generator of the system . to explicitly write the hamiltonian of our system we define the creation and annihilation operators on site @xmath20 by @xmath21 respectively . with the additional definition of the diagonal matrix @xmath22 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the model shown in figure [ diaarr ] is written @xmath23 where the index sums are taken modulo 4 .",
    "we are interested in finding the non - equilibrium stationary state @xmath24 of our system . by definition ,",
    "this probability does not change in time and is therefore , such that @xmath25 it has been shown that for the zrp on any lattice geometry the steady state factorises as the tensor product ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath26 here each site s probability distribution vector is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 the probability of finding @xmath29 particles on the @xmath30th - site and @xmath31 the corresponding configuration vector .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 is given in terms of the site s fugacity @xmath32 and the interaction term @xmath8 by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the grand canonical partition function @xmath35 it now becomes obvious that the choice of the interaction @xmath8 will be reflected in the existence of the partition function .",
    "for instance , if we let @xmath36 with @xmath37 a constant , then we have to make sure that @xmath38 in order for the infinite sum of equation ( [ infsum ] ) to converge and the partition function to exist . hopping parameters leading to @xmath39",
    "correspond physically to a growing condensate . in the remainder of this paper we will assume , unless stated otherwise , an unbounded interaction rate @xmath8 for the particles , i.e. , @xmath40 this guarantees that the system has a non - equilibrium stationary state without condensation . +",
    "it can be shown that the creation and annihilation operators act on the stationary - state eigenvector of the hamiltonian as @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "here we have made explicit that the operators corresponding to the @xmath30th - site act only on the probability distribution vector of the same site .",
    "thus , applying the hamiltonian ( [ hamdia ] ) to the stationary state vector @xmath24 yields the expression @xmath43|p^*\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath24 to be the required stationary state the coefficients of the matrices @xmath44 must vanish . solving the resulting system of equations leads to the fugacities @xmath45",
    "note that with these solutions , one verifies that @xmath46 , which is consistent with the stationary state being the eigenvector with eigenvalue zero .",
    "+ with these fugacities , we can calculate the mean time - averaged current @xmath47 which measures the average number of particles jumping from site @xmath48 to site @xmath49 per unit time .",
    "this current is expressed in terms of the fugacities as @xmath50 here once again , @xmath51 and modulo 4 applies over the subindex addition .",
    "similarly , for the boundary sites the mean current is @xmath52 with the convention of a positive flow direction from the left to the right boundary of the lattice .",
    "+ since we have assumed the system is in a stationary state without condensation , the mean currents must satisfy @xmath53 by particle conservation . from this",
    "we then find that the mean current at the left boundary is positive if @xmath54 which is equivalent to @xmath55 or @xmath56 this condition implies a net current left - to - right through the system .",
    "if conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) are satisfied , it follows that the largest fugacity is @xmath57 .",
    "hence , returning to the discussion of a bounded interaction @xmath8 , the consistency condition for existence of a stationary state without condensation is @xmath58 .",
    "an interesting feature of the model we are studying is that it shows a transition from a unidirectional mean current to a loop mean current regime as the parameters are varied ",
    "see figure [ unid - loop ] . an intuitive way to see this change , is to consider specific parameter values . on one hand , when we have symmetric hopping rates @xmath59 , the mean current flows clockwise through the upper branch and anti - clockwise through the lower branch , i.e. , the unidirectional regime . on the other hand , when we have completely asymmetric hopping rates @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the mean current flow is forced to go around the diamond , i.e. , the loop current regime .",
    "since the mean current through the lower branch changes from anti - clockwise to clockwise direction as the regime changes from unidirectional to a loop , one way to determine where the transition occurs is to calculate the parameters at which the mean current @xmath62 between sites 1 and 4 vanishes . +        as a first step to characterize this change of regime in more detail we now consider the special case of @xmath63 , which corresponds to having only injection of particles at the left end of the lattice and only depletion at the right end .",
    "this allows us to understand the change of regime with fewer parameters and get some intuition for the cases with non - zero hopping rates @xmath1 and @xmath2 . + from equations ( [ fugacities ] ) and ( [ mean_curr ] ) the condition for a vanishing mean current @xmath62 is satisfied when @xmath64 where we have defined the ratios @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the curve defined by the equation above gives us the exact location of the regime change from positive to negative average current as shown in figure [ zercur ] .",
    "as expected , if @xmath67 ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) it does not matter how large the extraction rate @xmath68 ( or @xmath3 ) is , the system is always in the loop regime , whereas if @xmath69 ( i.e. , for symmetric hopping rates ) the system is always in the unidirectional regime .",
    "notice also that equation ( [ bofq ] ) has no dependence on the injection parameter @xmath0 which means , that for @xmath70 we can control the system regime just by changing the extraction rate @xmath3 . for large @xmath3 ,",
    "the system favours the unidirectional regime whereas , for low @xmath3 , a smaller fraction of the particles on site 3 can leave the system and a loop current is therefore more likely .    .",
    "red region @xmath71 .",
    "blue region @xmath72    in the general case where we admit injection and extraction of particles from both boundary sites , we can still compute the mean current @xmath62 : @xmath73 we can check again that for the special cases of symmetric hopping rates ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) the current is positive and the system is in the unidirectional regime , whereas for totally asymmetric rates ( i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) the current is negative and thus , in the loop current regime as expected . moreover , for fixed @xmath74 , we can see that the mean current regime can be chosen by changing the boundary rates where , just as in the special case discussed above , large @xmath3 favours the unidirectional regime and small @xmath3 the loop current regime . similarly , for fixed boundary conditions satisfying @xmath75 , we can choose the mean current regime by varying the bulk hopping rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a further remark about the existence of these two regimes , is that if we were to consider @xmath8 bounded we know that for some choices of the hopping rates the system would undergo condensation ( and have no steady state ) meaning , for example , that not all of the phase plane in figure [ zercur ] would be accessible .",
    "we now complement our results for the mean currents by studying their fluctuations .",
    "to be specific , we are interested in calculating the probability distribution @xmath76 of the time - averaged current @xmath77 between sites @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the lattice . in the long - time limit",
    ", we expect this distribution to follow the large deviation principle @xmath78 with rate function ( rf ) @xmath79 . here",
    "`` @xmath80 '' denotes asymptotic equality in the limit of large time .",
    "one way to obtain the rf is to calculate the scaled cumulant generating function ( scgf ) @xmath81 indeed , if the scgf is continuous and differentiable , then it is known that the rf is obtained from the scgf via the legendre transform @xcite as @xmath82    to calculate the scgf we need to modify the hamiltonian ( [ hamdia ] ) to count particle jumps .",
    "this is done by multiplying the terms accounting for the transfer of particles from sites @xmath48 to @xmath49 ( and vice versa ) by the exponential factor @xmath83 , see for example @xcite .",
    "then for instance , to measure the fluctuations of @xmath62 the required modified hamiltonian is : @xmath84 the scgf can be identified with the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian ( [ hamdiamod ] ) , which in general is different from zero .",
    "then we find the desired rf of the current @xmath85 via the legendre transform ( [ legtra ] ) .",
    "correlations between particle currents flowing through different bonds can be studied by considering a two - parameter scgf . for the diamond lattice",
    ", it is interesting for example to study the current flowing between sites 1 and 2 and the current flowing between sites 1 and 4 simultaneously .",
    "the joint scgf that characterizes the joint distribution @xmath86 of these currents is calculated analytically by modifying the system s hamiltonian similarly to described above .",
    "particle jumps between sites 1 and 2 are counted with parameter @xmath87 and between sites 1 and 4 with parameter @xmath88 .",
    "this calculation leads to the two - parameter scgf , @xmath89 where we have defined @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath90 .",
    "for the special case @xmath63 the scgf reduces to @xmath91 the rf @xmath92 associated with the joint distribution @xmath86 is obtained from this scgf via the double legendre transform : @xmath93 the numerical evaluation of this transform is shown in figure [ legtra2d ] . +    , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath69 ( i.e. , unidirectional regime ) .",
    "black lines cross at the minimum current @xmath97 .",
    "red line corresponds to the curve with constant @xmath98 for which the most likely value of @xmath85 is negative.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the rf of figure [ legtra2d ] is not defined for all currents , since for @xmath63 it follows that @xmath99 in the long time limit . for the parameters used in figure [ legtra2d ] , we also know from our analysis of section",
    "[ s : currentloops ] that each of the mean currents @xmath100 and @xmath62 corresponding to the minima of @xmath92 , are strictly positive , which means that we are in the unidirectional regime .",
    "what the joint rf shows is that , despite being in this regime , it is possible to have loop current fluctuations . in particular , for a fixed large positive current @xmath101 , the most probable value of @xmath85 is negative ( as this minimises the rf ) , implying that loop current fluctuations are more likely than unidirectional current fluctuations in this case .",
    "this behaviour is also seen for other values of parameters .",
    "+ note that from the joint scgf we can quickly recover the scgf of either of the two possible partial currents or the total current simply by making the correct selection of parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we shall do this in the following subsections .",
    "a possible use of the two - parameter scgf obtained above is to analyse the partial currents @xmath101 or @xmath85 . since the particle flow from site 1 to site 4 allows us to observe both positive and negative mean currents ( see section 3 ) , we choose to analyse this bond more closely . to do this we set the parameter @xmath102 and the resulting function",
    "is @xmath103    we can further simplify this function by considering the case @xmath63 in which we already studied the change of regime from unidirectional to loop mean current .",
    "the resulting scgf and the numerical rf are shown in figure [ scgfandrf ] . here",
    "we can observe again how the choice of the parameter @xmath68 affects the mean current flow through the lattice .",
    "+     with parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( red ) , @xmath107 ( black ) , @xmath108 ( blue ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +   with parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( red ) , @xmath107 ( black ) , @xmath108 ( blue ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we can see directly from the scgf whether the choice of parameters corresponds to a unidirectional or loop regime by looking at the slope of the function at @xmath109 .",
    "this is because , from large deviation theory , we know that the first derivative of the scgf at zero corresponds to the mean current between the sites we are looking at . hence , a positive slope implies a positive current and the unidirectional regime , whereas a negative slope implies the loop regime . at the level of the rf , this translates into having a positive or negative minimum , respectively , which determines the mean current . from the full form of the rf ,",
    "what can be seen again is that fluctuations of currents having a sign opposite to the mean current have a non - zero probability to be observed .",
    "this means concretely that loop current fluctuations can be seen in the unidirectional current regime and vice versa .",
    "another possibility , is not to differentiate between the two lattice branches but simply to measure the total flux of particles through the cross - section between site 1 and sites 2 and 4 , i.e. , @xmath110 .",
    "once again , the joint scgf ( [ fulljointscgf ] ) reduces to a single variable function but now by taking @xmath111 : @xmath112 the rf @xmath113 associated with the probability distribution of @xmath114 can be obtained analytically for this scgf , resulting in @xmath115 as expected , for the case of unbounded @xmath8 the same rf is found when measuring current fluctuations of @xmath116 or either of the boundary currents @xmath117 or @xmath118 .",
    "we shall use equation ( [ diamrf ] ) in the next subsection to show that fluctuations of total currents possess a particular symmetry property that fluctuations of partial currents do not have .      in the previous subsections",
    "we have seen that the large deviation rf provides rich information about stochastic models beyond the level of mean values .",
    "the study of such fluctuations allows us to find symmetries in the dynamics of a system rather than just spatial symmetries .",
    "in particular , the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation relation ( gcfr ) provides a well - known symmetry for the entropy production rate , which can be translated into a symmetry for the current rfs in interacting particle systems @xcite .",
    "+ the gcfr in the context of particle current fluctuations can be written as @xmath119 and makes a connection between the long - time probability of observing a time - averaged current @xmath114 and the probability of observing a current @xmath120 of the same magnitude in the reversed direction . here",
    ", @xmath121 is a constant which can be interpreted as an equilibrium - restoring field . since we are assuming that currents follow a large deviation principle as in equation ( [ largedevprinc ] ) , relation ( [ gcftrel ] )",
    "can also be written in terms of only the rfs as @xmath122    now that we know the probability rate function of observing particle currents measured through different bonds , we would like to investigate if our rate functions satisfy the gcfr . in our model",
    "it can be straightforwardly shown analytically that the rf ( [ diamrf ] ) for the fluctuations of the _ total _ current , @xmath110 , obeys the gcfr ( [ lineargcft ] ) with @xmath123 interestingly , due to the cyclic arrangement of the bulk hopping rates in this model , the equilibrium - restoring field @xmath121 turns out to be independent of the rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 and equal to the expression for a single - site zrp with open boundaries @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , for _ partial _ current fluctuations , the gcfr ( [ lineargcft ] ) is _ not _ satisfied .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure [ gcft ] where we plot @xmath124 for the numerical results obtained in section 4.3 and observe that is not linear in @xmath85 .",
    "however , we can see that for small @xmath85 the relation is approximately satisfied .",
    "the blue curve corresponds to the numerical values of @xmath125 with parameters @xmath105 , @xmath104 , @xmath126 and @xmath108 ( unidirectional regime ) whereas the straight line corresponds to @xmath127 with field @xmath128.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    our observations are consistent with recent results for other two dimensional models , both classical and quantum , which highlight the breakdown of the gcfr for partial currents @xcite .",
    "we emphasize here that the crucial point is not the existence of a loop mean current regime but that for some partial current fluctuations away from the mean , the most likely realisation involves loop current flow .",
    "this is confirmed by studying a variant of our model in which the rates on the lower branch are reversed ( see figure [ sqrlat ] ) and thus the possibility of a loop mean current is eliminated . performing a similar analysis as for the original diamond model one again observes loop fluctuations in the joint - probability rf and finds that the gcfr is satisfied for the total current , this time with @xmath129 , but not for partial currents .",
    "+        we conclude this subsection by commenting on the relation of our results to recent general analysis in the literature . a theory for electron currents on arbitrary networks",
    "was presented in @xcite and confirmed for some specific cases ; our model provides a complementary classical example in which fluctuations can be calculated exactly for interacting particles with _ any _ unbounded interaction @xmath8 .",
    "note that the total current @xmath114 in our system flows through input and output links which in the language of @xcite `` do not belong to any loop of the network '' and therefore the observed gcfr for the total current is consistent with the general arguments there .",
    "however , for the original version of the diamond model in figure [ diaarr ] , this total current @xmath114 is _ not _ proportional to the entropy production .",
    "the possibility of a gcfr - type symmetry for quantities other than entropy was also highlighted in @xcite in a slightly different context  a  peculiar \" network of configurations in state space .",
    "our model provides a simple demonstration of this newly proposed symmetry but for interacting particles on a real - space network and corresponding infinite state space . note , however , that for the modified model of figure [ sqrlat ] the total current @xmath114 is proportional to the entropy production rate .",
    "we illustrate the generality of our approach by extending the analysis to a chain of coupled diamonds as shown in figure [ diamondchain ] . following the discussion in section [ s : currentloops ] ,",
    "for partially asymmetric hopping rates @xmath130 we expect the mean current regime in the different diamonds to depend on the boundary parameters .",
    "furthermore , we now have the possibility of co - existence of unidirectional and loop current regimes along the chain  a scenario we shall explore in more detail below",
    ". +     diamonds . here",
    "the @xmath131th - diamond is formed by sites @xmath132 , @xmath133 , upper branch site @xmath134 and lower branch site @xmath135 . ]    from calculation of the mean steady - state currents as in section 2.2 , we find that to see a rightwards total mean current through the system , the boundary parameters must again satisfy @xmath136 assuming this condition , we now concentrate on determining how tuning the extraction rate , @xmath3 , controls the presence or absence of mean current loops for each diamond . from our analysis of the single diamond array , we expect that for a given asymmetry , small @xmath3 favours the loop current regime , whereas large @xmath3 leads to the unidirectional regime .",
    "furthermore , one intuitively expects that for large chains the influence of @xmath3 in the diamonds close to the left - hand side boundary is small .",
    "therefore , one expects for the diamond chain that for increasing @xmath3 , the diamonds close to the right - hand side boundary change to the unidirectional regime before the ones close to the opposite boundary .",
    "in other words , for intermediate @xmath3 there should be co - existence of two current domains located at left and right sides of the chain .",
    "+ a detailed analysis of the mean currents in the lower branch of each diamond confirms the above picture .",
    "however , it turns out that for strongly asymmetric bulk rates , the left - hand diamonds remain in the loop current regime regardless of how large the extraction rate is . for @xmath137 , considering the behaviour of the first diamond in the chain we can show that in order to find a finite @xmath3 such that all diamonds change regime , the hopping rates must satisfy @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the number of diamonds in the chain . hence for weakly asymmetric hopping rates ,",
    "there is a crossover between a phase in which there is a loop current in every diamond and a phase where the current is everywhere unidirectional .",
    "this transition persists even in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath140 .",
    "+ focusing on this weakly asymmetric case , we now set @xmath141 where @xmath142 takes values in @xmath143 . using exact numerics",
    "to check the mean current in each diamond , we plot in figure [ uniddiamratio ] how the proportion @xmath9 of diamonds in the unidirectional current regime increases with the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "one can clearly see convergence towards a limiting curve as @xmath139 increases . in the thermodynamic limit , the exact critical value at which the right most diamond changes regime is given analytically by @xmath144 note that this critical point always satisfies assumption ( [ cond3 ] ) which is essential for a rightwards total mean current .",
    "+     for @xmath60 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 5 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 from bottom to top . ]",
    "we can also calculate the generating function for the current fluctuations through any of the cross - sections of the chain by using the same method as in section [ s : currentfluct ] . in this case",
    ", we verify again that it is only for total currents that the gcfr is satisfied ; specifically , we obtain the same field @xmath121 as for the single diamond regardless of the length of the chain .",
    "we have performed a current fluctuation analysis of the zero - range process on a diamond lattice with open boundaries . for rates which impose a preferred direction around the diamond",
    ", we demonstrated the possibility of two different mean current regimes depending on the boundary parameters and the asymmetry of the bulk hopping rates .",
    "moreover , for the case in which particles are only injected on one side of the diamond and only removed from the other we proved that , regardless of the injection rate , we could control the regime of the system just by varying the extraction rate . + analysing the current fluctuations via the two - parameter scaled cumulant generating function , we also studied the joint probability distribution of the partial and total currents flowing between sites 1 and 2 and between sites 1 and 4 of the lattice .",
    "significantly , we saw from the joint current rate function that both unidirectional and loop current fluctuations may be observed whether the mean current is unidirectional or in a loop .",
    "+ from our analysis we also confirmed that to observe the gallavotti - cohen fluctuation relation we need to measure total currents as opposed to partial currents .",
    "this point should obviously be taken into account when testing fluctuation symmetries in higher dimensional systems in experiment or simulation . indeed ,",
    "the recent isometric fluctuation relation @xcite which is a generalised symmetry for higher dimensions , is also concerned with global rather than local currents .",
    "+ finally , we applied our methods to a chain of diamonds and explicitly demonstrated that it can support co - existence of different current domains .",
    "we emphasize that our results hold only for the case of an unbounded site interaction @xmath8 ; it would be interesting to extend the analysis to the case of bounded @xmath8 where one expects the formation of `` instantaneous condensates '' and a breakdown of the fluctuation symmetry even for total currents @xcite .",
    "for such models on higher dimensional lattices or more complex geometries we expect loop current or vortex fluctuations to play an important role ."
