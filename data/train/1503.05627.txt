    "the dimensionality of a many - particle system is a crucial determinator for how importantly interaction effects can shape its physical properties . generally , three - dimensional ( 3d ) bulk conductors are less drastically affected by the coulomb interaction between charge carriers than lower - dimensional , quantum - confined structures such as quasi-2d quantum wells and quasi-1d quantum ( nano-)wires  @xcite .",
    "this is essentially due to phase - space restrictions arising from free motion being only possible in fewer than three spatial directions .",
    "furthermore , the exact structure of transverse bound - state wave functions shapes the density distribution of the confined charge carriers and , thus , turns out to critically influence coulombic effects in quantum wells  @xcite and wires  @xcite . here",
    "we explore how another aspect of quantum - confined states , namely their intrinsic spinor structure , modifies the effect of the coulomb interaction in nanostructured systems .",
    "most low - dimensional conductors are fabricated from semiconductor materials where the coupling between the spin degree of charge carriers and their orbital motion is often quite strong  @xcite . as a result",
    ", quantum confinement can significantly affect spin - related properties  @xcite .",
    "such effects are particularly pronounced for valence - band states ( i.e. , _ holes _ ) because of their peculiar spin-@xmath0 character  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , conduction - band electrons are spin-@xmath1 particles and generally subject to weaker spin - orbit couplings that are due to the bulk inversion asymmetry in the material s crystallographic unit cell ( dresselhaus  @xcite spin splitting ) or the structural inversion asymmetry present in a nanostructured systems ( rashba  @xcite spin splitting ) . the multitude , and often counter - intuitive nature , of spin - orbit effects in nanostructures has become the focus of recent study , with developing an understanding of the interplay with coulomb interactions being a key question to be addressed .",
    "bulk - hole systems  @xcite , quantum - well - confined holes  @xcite , and 2d electron systems subject to rashba spin splitting  @xcite have been considered .",
    "the comparatively few studies of coulomb - interaction effects in spin - orbit - coupled quasi-1d systems  @xcite have almost exclusively focused on effective luttinger - liquid descriptions  @xcite and , in particular , did not investigate the effect of rashba spin splitting on the total exchange energy and exchange - induced quasiparticle - effective - mass renormalization in quantum wires .    in this article , we fill precisely this gap and investigate both the exchange energy and effective - mass renormalization in quantum wires with a rashba - type spin - orbit coupling . previous work on the exchange energy of quantum wells revealed that spin - orbit coupling has the opposite effect on interactions in n - type and p - type systems : the exchange energy of a quasi-2d conduction - band electron system is slightly enhanced  @xcite due to spin - orbit coupling , whereas the exchange energy for quasi-2d holes is suppressed due to confinement - induced valence - band mixing  @xcite and the heavy - hole - type rashba spin splitting  @xcite .",
    "the different behavior of confined band electrons and holes warrants more systematic investigation and , as we will see below , considering the quasi-1d case sheds new light on the different ramifications of spin - orbit coupling in interacting systems .",
    "our investigation also reveals that the quasiparticle effective - mass is more strongly suppressed by the exchange interaction in nanowires with spin splitting .",
    "in addition , quantum wires with strong spin - orbit coupling are currently attracting great interest as possible hosts of exotic quasiparticle excitations such as majorana  @xcite and fractional  @xcite fermions . clarifying the effect of interactions in such systems is necessary for a complete understanding of experiments aimed at verifying the existence of the unusual quasi - particle excitations .",
