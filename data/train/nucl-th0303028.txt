    "the recent report of a @xmath1he uniquely identified event in nuclear emulsion @xcite , with @xmath8 binding energy value @xmath9 mev , has triggered renewed interest in the physics of double-@xmath2 hypernuclei , particularly for light species . the previous , old report of @xmath10 mev @xcite which has been considered dubious by the hypernuclear community implied a fairly strong @xmath8 interaction potential , considerably stronger than the @xmath11 interaction potential deduced from studying single-@xmath2 hypernuclei and at odds with one - boson - exchange models @xcite . in contrast , the new event is compatible with a fairly weak @xmath8 interaction , with scattering length @xmath12 fm @xcite considerably smaller in magnitude than @xmath13 fm for the @xmath11 interaction @xcite .",
    "with such a weak @xmath8 interaction it becomes interesting to explore the onset of @xmath8 binding in nuclei .",
    "our earlier faddeev calculations @xcite of the @xmath14 @xmath8 hypernuclei @xmath0h and @xmath0he suggested that these species are comfortably particle stable for weak @xmath8 interaction potentials , and this has been recently confirmed by the variational calculation of ref .",
    "however , for @xmath15 the situation is unclear , with conflicting calculational conclusions @xcite for the @xmath16 four - body @xmath17h hypernucleus which has been recently conjectured to exist in the experimental report of ref .",
    "a three - body @xmath18 bound state is ruled out on general grounds @xcite .    in our earlier work",
    "@xcite the @xmath19 @xmath20 hypernuclei @xmath21h , @xmath22he and @xmath23he were considered as three - body systems @xmath24 , where the ( assumed inert ) nuclear cluster @xmath25 stands for @xmath26h , @xmath26he or @xmath27he respectively .",
    "the faddeev equations were then solved for model @xmath8 interactions under an @xmath28-wave approximation ( to be specified below ) using @xmath29 interaction potentials fitted to the observed @xmath29 binding energies .",
    "it was argued , by comparing to earlier non - faddeev calculations for @xmath23he , that the use of this approximation incurred an error of roughly 0.2 mev . in the present work",
    "we extend our earlier faddeev calculations , relaxing the @xmath28-wave approximation and testing the convergence of these calculations with respect to the partial wave expansion . to this end",
    "we have followed the formulation and numerical solution method outlined and tested by bernabu _",
    "@xcite for faddeev equations in configuration space .",
    "the calculations here reported do confirm our earlier estimates . since @xmath23he serves in most applications as the primary normalizing datum for extracting phenomenologically the @xmath8 interaction , it is desirable to improve as much as possible the calculational aspects of the @xmath23he binding energy evaluation in order to gain confidence in such extraction .",
    "we therefore compare our faddeev calculations to other , non - faddeev calculations of the @xmath19 @xmath8 hypernuclei .",
    "finally , we comment on the order of magnitude expected for dynamical effects due to @xmath30 mixing .",
    "the bound states of the three - body systems considered in this work are obtained by solving the differential faddeev equations @xcite    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a short - range pair interaction in the channel @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the internal kinetic energy operator , @xmath35 is the total energy and the wavefunction of the three - body system is given as a sum @xmath36 over the three faddeev components , corresponding to the two - body rearrangement channels .",

    "we have followed the isle potential due to ref .",
    "@xcite which was shown to provide good agreement with the measured mesonic weak decay rate of @xmath90he .",
    "the resulting @xmath2-hyperon density distribution has been shown very recently @xcite to closely resemble that due to a microscopic calculation of @xmath90he using @xmath91 interactions which simulate those of model nsc97 @xcite .",
    "the parameters of this potential are listed in table 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite recently have used different parameters for this @xmath28-wave interaction potential , and also kept an option for using a weaker @xmath92-wave potential .",

    "some of the older works used purely attractive @xmath29 potentials which are no longer considered realistic ones .",
    "in this section we report binding - energy results of solving the coupled faddeev equations for @xmath95 systems with @xmath96 , using a sufficiently large cutoff value @xmath97 for the angular momenta of the partial two - body systems .",

    "convergence is reached already for @xmath109 , merely 0.06 mev higher than the @xmath106 value corresponding to the @xmath110 @xmath28-wave approximation .",
    "our faddeev calculations ( marked fgs ) are compared in the table to the ikeda _",
    "@xcite schrdinger - equation calculations which were restricted to the @xmath111 rearrangement channel , disregarding the @xmath112 rearrangement channel .",
    "therefore , calculations of this latter type offer neither a way to sort out a range of values for @xmath113 nor a meaning for @xmath28-wave approximation ; indeed , improving over what would have been perceived as an @xmath28-wave approximation ( @xmath114 ) amounts in ref .",
    "@xcite to 0.5 mev , about eight times the corresponding improvement for our faddeev calculation .",
    "more importantly , our faddeev calculations demonstrate that the ikeda _",
    "_ calculation misses our converged value of @xmath106 by about 0.4 mev ( which is a sizable miss in this three - body trade ) .",
    "a comparison is also offered in table [ tab : tabl1 ] with the variational calculation by portilho and coon @xcite , extrapolated from @xmath115 .",
    "the agreement with our exact faddeev calculation is remarkable .",
    "this variational calculation uses a large basis of harmonic oscillator wavefunctions , with a variable spring constant , in the @xmath111 rearrangement channel .",
    "it works well because these wavefunctions within a given dimension may be cast into a similar basis of the same dimensionality in the @xmath112 rearrangement channel , a property which is exclusively specific to harmonic oscillator wavefunctions . finally , we quote in the table the result of the pioneering dalitz and rajasekaran @xcite variational calculation , using a @xmath1he ansatz wavefunction @xmath116 which accounts through its variational parameters for short - range correlations as well as for obvious long - range asymptotic requirements . in this outstanding calculation dalitz and rajasekaran",
    "used the same @xmath5 interaction as used in the subsequent calculations listed in table [ tab : tabl1 ] , but their @xmath89 interaction was slightly different , although it was constrained by fitting to the observed @xmath90he binding energy .",
    "for this reason we hesitate to claim that their 40 years old variational calculation matches today s faddeev techniques , yet even if they missed the exact result by only 0.1 mev ( or less ) it is a tribute to the essential physics requirements imposed on the parameterization of the functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 of which the wavefunction @xmath119 in eq . ( [ eq : dr ] ) consists of .    in table [ tab : tabl2 ] we show @xmath106 values calculated by us",
    "( marked fgs ) , this time using a @xmath5 isle potential together with a purely attractive @xmath89 interaction potential , both taken from the work of khan and das @xcite .",
    "these potentials , again , act in all the allowed partial waves .",
    "our @xmath28-wave approximation , here too , works very well ( to order of 0.04 mev ) , in contrast with the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) calculation by khan and das which falls short of 1 mev in its first round .",
    "nevertheless , the hh calculation is a systematical one , treating _",
    "correctly _ all the three - body degrees of freedom in the limit of going to infinitely large values of the hyper - angular momentum @xmath120 which serves as a measure of the size of space in which the coupled three - body equations are solved . for @xmath97 where comparison is possible",
    ", the agreement between the faddeev calculation and the hh calculation is excellent .",
    "however , the hh calculation may suggest that higher values of @xmath107 beyond @xmath97 are needed in our faddeev calculation in order to reach convergence , whereas this faddeev calculation appears already converged at @xmath97 .",
    "we now switch to a more realistic @xmath28-wave @xmath89 isle interaction , with a repulsive core as shown by the solid curve in fig .",

    "values are shown in table [ tab : tabl3 ] for @xmath122 .",
    "it is seen that the deviation of @xmath106 for a given value of @xmath107 from its @xmath28-wave approximation @xmath123 grows monotonically with @xmath107 , reaching about 0.2 mev for @xmath124 . while it is still reasonably small , of the order of magnitude of the experimental error @xcite derived from the observed emulsion tracks for @xmath1he , this deviation is several times bigger than for the calculations summarized in the previous tables which shared purely attractive @xmath125 potentials in common .",
    "this is due to the contribution of @xmath126 getting enhanced for @xmath125 interactions of an isle form , compared to such contribution for a purely attractive potential .",
    "however , since it is unrealistic to use the same @xmath28-wave @xmath125 interaction for all @xmath125 partial waves , one should expect the above deviation to be smaller once a more realistic ( weaker ) @xmath92-wave potential component is introduced .",

    "are given in the last row of the table and are in very good agreement with our @xmath28-wave approximation results .",
    "it appears that by limiting the variational calculation to @xmath130 , as might be understood from the discussion at the beginning of their section 3 , the whole evaluation turned out to be limited to the @xmath28-wave approximation .",
    "we have also pursued the _ full _ spin - dependent calculation for the @xmath134 hypernuclei and found out that it yields 0.08 mev higher binding than for the spin - averaged results shown in table [ tab : tabl4 ] .",

    "@xcite , using their parameterization of the corresponding potentials @xmath138 and @xmath135 .",
    "it is seen that the inclusion of a coupling potential , motivated by the nsc97e free - space interaction , increases the calculated binding energy by @xmath140 mev .",
    "we note that the simulation of the @xmath6 coupling potential @xmath141 in ref .",

    "the @xmath6 coupling potentials due to model nsc97 involve a subtle pattern of cancellations between pseudoscalar ( @xmath120 ) vector ( @xmath142 ) and scalar ( @xmath143 ) meson - exchange contributions , the net result being considerably weaker than assumed by the parameterization in tables 2,3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , for stronger potentials ( diagonal as well as off - diagonal , each consisting of a short - range repulsive component plus a longer - range attractive component motivated by model nd ) , found that by including the @xmath6 coupling one adds 0.50 mev as shown in the table too .",
    "a consequence of their methodology is that for the considerably weaker nsc97 interactions , the total effect of including the @xmath6 coupling would amount to much less , as argued recently by afnan and gibson @xcite .",
    "an important consideration in the discussion of the @xmath6 coupling effect is the extent to which this coupling is pauli suppressed .",
    "for example , in @xmath1he transitions creating a fifth nucleon in the @xmath144 shell are pauli forbidden .",
    "this means that @xmath135 is less attractive in @xmath1he than in free space where it was derived .",
    "@xcite estimated the corresponding suppression for potentials @xmath88 and @xmath136 to be _ at least _ as large as 0.43 mev , almost saturating the _ total _ 0.5 mev @xmath6 coupling effect calculated for these same potentials .",
    "this casts doubts on the validity of their method of estimate of the pauli suppression effect .",
    "we note that the contribution due to what they perceive as the pauli blocked transition is inversely proportional to the mass difference @xmath145 between the initial @xmath1he(0@xmath139 ) ground state and the intermediate @xmath146he forbidden state .",
    "this mass difference is estimated by them to be @xmath147 mev , ignoring the substantial binding that a fifth nucleon in the @xmath144 shell would have acquired in the field of the @xmath4he core .",
    "estimating this extra binding to be of the order of 25 mev , the mass difference would reduce to merely @xmath148 mev , resulting in an unacceptably large pauli suppression effect of order 2 mev which exceeds substantially the total 0.5 mev @xmath6 coupling effect .",

    "in this work we have studied light @xmath5 hypernuclei ( @xmath96 ) which may be described in terms of @xmath95 ( @xmath25=cluster ) systems and treated by solving the three - body faddeev equations .",
    "our calculations confirm the estimates made by filikhin and gal @xcite that the @xmath28-wave approximation ( @xmath131 ) works fairly well and that the contribution of higher partial waves is small ( @xmath150 0.2 mev ) if ordered according to increasing @xmath107 .",
