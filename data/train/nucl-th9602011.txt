    "relativistic hydrodynamic models are frequently applied to study high  energy heavy ",
    "ion collisions @xcite , because they simply represent ( local ) energy  momentum and charge conservation .",
    "their main advantage is that they provide a _",
    "direct _ link between space ",
    "time dynamics , i.e. , observable flow phenomena , and the nuclear matter equation of state .",
    "they are therefore a unique tool to investigate e.g.  effects of phase transitions , such as the deconfinement transition to the quark  gluon plasma , on the dynamics of the reaction @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics requires the assumption of _ local thermodynamical equilibrium _ , i.e. , it describes the evolution of an _ ideal _ fluid @xcite .",
    "this assumption obviously breaks down in the very early stages of ultrarelativistic heavy  ion collisions ( the stopping power of nuclear matter is insufficient to produce immediate thermalization of matter in the collision zone ) and in the very late stages of heavy ",
    "ion collisions at all energies . in this stage ,",
    "the interaction rate between individual particles becomes too small , or equivalently , their mean free path between collisions becomes too long , to maintain local thermodynamical equilibrium in the expanding system , and non  equilibrium processes become dominant .",
    "eventually , particles will decouple completely and stream freely until they reach the detector .    in order to calculate experimental observables",
    "it is essential to incorporate this so - called _ freeze  out _ into the hydrodynamical simulation of a heavy  ion collision .",
    "the long mean free path or the small interaction rate , respectively , suggest a treatment of the freeze  out via kinetic theory @xcite . up to now , however , no attempt has been made to combine the hydrodynamical and the kinetic description to model the late expansion stage of a heavy  ion collision .",
    "the most simple and therefore often used method is to assume an _ instantaneous _ transition from fluid - dynamical motion to free  streaming .",
    "note that microscopic models for heavy ",
    "ion collisions @xcite do not encounter this problem , since they follow the trajectories of individual particles . on the other hand ,",
    "their disadvantage is that they do not provide a direct link to the nuclear matter equation of state and , when based on binary scatterings , become invalid for higher densities .    in this paper",
    "we present a systematic comparison of two different instantaneous freeze  out scenarios presently used in the literature , namely the freeze  out across a space  time hypersurface defined by a constant temperature ( referred to as `` isothermal '' freeze  out in the following ) and that across one defined by a constant time in the center - of - momentum ( cm ) frame of the system , respectively ( subsequently termed `` isochronous '' freeze  out ) .",
    "contributions from time - like and space - like parts of the hypersurface are discussed separately and it is shown that the often used approximation of neglecting the time - like contributions in the isothermal freeze  out scenario leads to serious distortions of the rapidity spectra , and moreover violates the conservation laws .",
    "the above freeze  out scenarios are not strictly self - consistent , because the hypersurface is determined _ after _ the fluid - dynamical problem has been solved in the _ whole _ forward light cone . in other words , the influence of the freeze  out of particles from the ( time - like or space - like ) surface of the fluid on the dynamical evolution is neglected .",
    "although attempts to treat this problem analytically have been made @xcite , up to now no generally accepted solution exists .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the underlying relativistic hydrodynamic expansion model . in section 3",
    "we introduce the two different freeze  out scenarios .",
    "section 4 contains a discussion of single  inclusive rapidity distributions and transverse momentum spectra . in section 5",
    "we present our results and close with a summary in section 6 .",
    "we use natural units , @xmath0 .",
    "since we want to focus on the effects of different freeze  out scenarios on the final particle spectra , we choose a particularly simple and transparent hydrodynamic expansion model , namely the one  dimensional expansion of a finite slab of matter with an ultrarelativistic ideal gas equation of state .",
    "this model was first studied by landau et al.@xcite .",
    "the expansion with landau initial conditions can to first approximation serve to describe the evolution of ( net ) baryon  free matter in the central region of ultrarelativistic heavy  ion collisions @xmath1 . in the following we briefly outline the essential ingredients and results of the landau expansion model",
    ".    in general , relativistic hydrodynamics implies ( local ) energy  momentum conservation , @xmath2 where for an ideal fluid the energy ",
    "momentum tensor reads @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the energy density and pressure in the local rest frame of matter , @xmath6 is the metric tensor , and @xmath7 is the fluid 4velocity ( @xmath8 ) . the system of eqs .",
    "( [ dtmn ] , [ tmn ] ) is closed by choosing an equation of state for the matter under consideration . for an ultrarelativistic ideal gas",
    "this is @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the velocity of sound . for the particular application to heavy ",
    "ion collisions , we may think of an ideal ( massless ) pion gas . then",
    ", the energy density is given in terms of the temperature @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the degeneracy factor for pions ( assuming isospin symmetry ) .",
    "the particle density @xmath14 in the local rest frame is @xmath15    in the cm frame , the initial conditions for the one  dimensional expansion of a finite slab of length @xmath16 into vacuum @xcite are @xmath17 note that all lengths and times scale with @xmath18 .",
    "the system evolves as follows , cf .",
    "fig .  1 .",
    "initially , the discontinuities at @xmath19 decay into two simple ( riemann ) rarefaction waves .",
    "the wave fronts move into the slab with velocities @xmath20 and into the vacuum with the speed of light @xmath21 . at the cm time",
    "@xmath22 the two simple waves meet at the center and begin to overlap . at later times",
    "@xmath23 there are three distinct regions of hydrodynamic flow in the forward light cone .",
    "we call the one at the center of the system , where the two rarefaction waves overlap , the _ landau region _ @xcite , because landau was the first to determine the hydrodynamic solution in this region .",
    "the other two are called _ riemann regions _ , because here the hydrodynamic solution is still given by the original simple riemann rarefaction waves .    since we ultimately want to apply the freeze  out scenarios discussed in this work to more complicated , three  dimensional simulations , we study the landau expansion numerically . for the numerical solution we employ the explicit shasta algorithm @xcite . the applicability of this version of shasta to relativistic one  dimensional compression and expansion problems in thermodynamically normal matter has been demonstrated in refs .  @xcite .",
    "we employ a reduced antidiffusion and also a simple full  step method for updating source terms .    the initial temperature profile and typical profiles for times @xmath23",
    "are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the temperature is calculated from the local energy density @xmath4 according to ( [ epi ] ) , and normalized to the initial temperature @xmath24 .",
    "note that the overlapping rarefaction waves in the landau region produce a local minimum of energy density and temperature at fixed cm times @xmath25 .",
    "this is essentially a relativistic effect : faster matter at larger @xmath26 experiences more time dilation and thus cools not as fast in the cm frame as slower matter near the center @xcite .",
    "a particle `` freezes out '' when its interactions with the rest of the system cease . in principle",
    ", this can happen at any space  time point of the many  particle evolution , depending on the ( finite ) mean free path of the particular particle . in a one  component system ,",
    "the mean free path is estimated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ( total ) cross section and @xmath14 the ( local ) comoving particle density . if @xmath29 is small enough such that local thermodynamical equilibrium is established , ideal hydrodynamics is valid ( and @xmath14 is , for a pionic system , given by eq .",
    "( [ npi ] ) ) . for larger @xmath29",
    "non  equilibrium effects become increasingly important , and if @xmath29 exceeds the system s dimension @xmath30 , the latter starts to decouple into free  streaming particles . to describe the system s evolution in the latter two stages in principle requires kinetic theory .    up to now",
    ", drastic simplifications of the freeze  out stage were made for practical calculations @xcite .",
    "the first assumption is that the intermediate region where @xmath31 has negligible extent and can be approximated by a hypersurface in space  time .",
    "when a fluid element crosses this hypersurface , particles contained in that element freeze out instantaneously .",
    "the second assumption is that the freeze  out of particles does not change the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "because of energy and momentum carried away by the leaving particles , the hydrodynamical solution is obviously influenced .",
    "also , the decoupling of a particle from the flow perturbes ( local ) thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium in the respective fluid element . in general , the freeze  out should be treated in a self - consistent way taking all these effects into account .",
    "this , however , is out of the scope of the present work .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", here we also assume instantaneous freeze  out across a hypersurface .",
    "we focus on two different scenarios .",
    "the first , referred to in the following as _ isothermal freeze  out _ , corresponds to freeze  out at a constant fluid temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the second corresponds to freeze  out at a constant cm time @xmath33 and is referred to as _ isochronous freeze  out_.      the isothermal freeze  out is based on assumptions originally formulated by landau @xcite .",
    "he argued that the freeze  out of an interacting hadronic fluid into free  streaming particles takes place at a certain freeze  out temperature @xmath34 which , according to eq .",
    "( [ mfp ] ) with @xmath35 , depends only weakly on the system s size , @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the isotherm with @xmath37 defines the freeze  out hypersurface . for pions we have ( roughly ) @xmath38 @xmath39 ( at the energy scale relevant for pion  pion collisions in a thermal ensemble ) .",
    "we also assume @xmath40 fm ( cf .",
    "2 ) , where the initial size of the hot central region was estimated to be @xmath41 fm ( for an equilibration time @xmath42 fm after impact ) , and obtain with eq .",
    "( [ npi ] ) the freeze  out criterion @xmath43 , where @xmath44 mev is the pion mass .",
    "in order to apply this scenario to our underlying expansion model presented in section 2 , the isotherm of temperature @xmath34 has to be found numerically on the calculational grid . as an example , fig .",
    "1 shows the isotherm @xmath45 .",
    "the isotherm is in very good agreement with that calculated with the ( semi  analytical ) method of characteristics , see @xcite .",
    "a hypersurface element is called space - like if its normal vector is time - like , and vice versa .",
    "the whole isothermal hypersurface can be divided into space- and time - like parts according to fig .  1 .      due to its simplicity , the isochronous freeze  out scenario",
    "is widely used in ( 3 + 1)dimensional one and multi  fluid - dynamics @xcite .",
    "the freeze  out condition one commonly assumes is that the _ average _ temperature of the system at cm time @xmath33 drops below a given value @xmath32 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is calculated according to @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath14 is the local rest frame density given by eq .",
    "( [ npi ] ) .",
    "note that the hypersurface for isochronous freeze  out is purely space - like .",
    "1 shows the hypersurfaces at cm times @xmath33 when ( a ) the _ average _ temperature is @xmath50 ( @xmath51 , lower line ) , and ( b ) when the _ maximum _ temperature in the system has dropped below @xmath32 ( `` late '' isochronous freeze  out , @xmath52 , upper line ) . fig .",
    "2 shows the corresponding temperature profiles .",
    "although the isochronous freeze  out surfaces are purely space - like , we distinguish `` time - like '' ( dotted ) and `` space - like '' ( full line ) parts as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "this is motivated by the situation at `` late '' isochronous freeze  out : the energy and momentum associated with particles freezing out across @xmath53 in the isothermal freeze  out scenario later has to cross the dotted , `` time - like '' parts of the `` late '' isochronous freeze  out surface , because it can not leave the forward light cone .",
    "on the other hand , the energy and momentum freezing out across @xmath54 is the same that freezes out across the `` space - like '' part of the `` late '' isochronous freeze  out surface .",
    "in both freeze  out scenarios , the distribution of particles that have decoupled from the fluid is determined as follows .",
    "the ( lorentz  invariant ) momentum  space distribution of particles crossing a hypersurface @xmath55 in minkowski space is given by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the local equilibrium distribution function @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the normal vector on an ( infinitesimal ) element of the hypersurface @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath60 is naturally chosen to point outwards with respect to the hotter interior of @xmath55 , since ( [ coo1 ] ) is supposed to give the momentum distribution of particles decoupling from the fluid . in our case of one  dimensional geometry , the transverse dimensions enter only as a ( constant ) transverse area factor @xmath61 . the parametric integration over the hypersurface @xmath55 in ( [ coo1 ] ) is performed by distinguishing space - like parts @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 as integration variable ) and time - like parts @xmath64 ( with @xmath65 as integration variable ) , cf .",
    "fig .  1 .",
    "this yields the total momentum  space distribution @xmath66~,\\label{cp3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the ( longitudinal ) particle rapidity , @xmath68 is the transverse mass ( which reduces to @xmath69 for massless particles ) , and @xmath70 is the ( longitudinal ) fluid rapidity . @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the ( local ) slope of the space - like and the inverse slope of the time - like hypersurface element , respectively .",
    "note that the parametric integration in eq .",
    "( [ hypercooper ] ) holds for a mathematically positive orientation of @xmath55 .",
    "we now apply eq .",
    "( [ cp3 ] ) to the isothermal freeze  out scenario . along the isotherm , @xmath73 and",
    "only @xmath74 depends on position or time , respectively .",
    "the rapidity distribution is obtained by integrating ( [ cp3 ] ) over transverse momentum .",
    "for massless particles , @xmath75~.\\label{cp9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analogously , the transverse momentum distribution is obtained integrating over @xmath76 , @xmath77~.    \\label{cp11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in the isochronous freeze  out scenario the hypersurface @xmath55 has no time - like part and the second term in ( [ cp3 ] ) vanishes . moreover ,",
    "also the first term in the numerator of the remaining term vanishes due to @xmath78 for this particular hypersurface .",
    "the temperature along the hypersurface , however , is no longer constant .",
    "thus the rapidity distribution becomes @xmath79 while the transverse momentum distribution is @xmath80 note that the boundaries of the @xmath63integration correspond to the light cone .",
    "in this section we discuss the pion rapidity and transverse momentum spectra for isothermal and isochronous freeze  out using the expansion model of section 2 .",
    "note that for ideal fluid dynamics , entropy is conserved .",
    "since for a gas of massless particles the particle number density is proportional to the entropy density , @xmath81 , also the total particle number is conserved .",
    "the rapidity distributions presented in this section are numerically checked to fulfill this conservation law to better than @xmath82 accuracy ( across hypersurfaces bounded by the light cone ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we present the rapidity spectrum for isothermal freeze  out , eq .  ( [ cp9 ] ) , along the isotherm @xmath45 that was shown in fig .  1 . the contributions from the different parts of the hypersurface as indicated in fig .  1 are shown separately .",
    "the total spectrum ( full line ) shows a double  peak structure , and a small local maximum at @xmath83 . the time - like contributions ( dashed ) can become negative for particles with a longitudinal velocity @xmath84 which is smaller than the inverse slope of the time - like hypersurface , because then @xmath85 < 0 $ ] .",
    "these contributions correspond to particles that are overtaken by the freeze  out condition , and thus in principle re - enter the fluid instead of freezing out .",
    "note that it is important to count these particles with their correct ( negative ) sign in order to ensure energy ",
    "momentum , entropy , and particle number conservation . as can be seen in fig .  3 , the space - like contributions to the spectrum ( dash - dotted ) are always positive , due to @xmath86 .    the transverse momentum spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ cp11 ] ) , is shown in fig .  4 . here",
    "one observes that the time - like part of the hypersurface ( dashed ) contributes less particles than the space - like one ( dash - dotted ) , but the slope is the same , reflecting the fact that the temperature along the isothermal freeze  out hypersurface is constant by definition .",
    "the observed low@xmath69 enhancement is due to bose",
    " einstein statistics .    for comparison , fig .",
    "5 shows the rapidity spectrum for isochronous freeze  out , eq .",
    "( [ cp13 ] ) , with @xmath50 .",
    "the total spectrum ( full line ) shows a double  peak structure with a local minimum at @xmath83 which originates from the time dilation effect discussed in section 2 .",
    "different contributions from the `` time - like '' and `` space - like '' parts as defined in section 3.3 are shown separately ( dashed , dash - dotted lines ) . as is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ cp13 ] ) , there are no negative contributions to the spectrum .    the corresponding transverse momentum spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ cp14 ] ) , is presented in fig .",
    "the `` space - like '' part of the fluid distribution has on the average a higher temperature and thus its contribution to the transverse momentum spectrum a smaller ( negative ) slope than the corresponding spectrum from the `` time - like '' parts .",
    "the total spectrum ( full line ) is nevertheless very similar to the one in the isothermal freeze  out , fig .  4 , because the _ average _ temperature at freeze  out is the same in both scenarios .",
    "we now study the dependence of the spectra on the freeze  out temperature .",
    "7 shows rapidity spectra for isothermal freeze  out at @xmath87 . for the largest @xmath32values the rapidity spectrum peaks at finite @xmath76 while for smaller @xmath32 also a peak at central rapidity @xmath83 develops . only for @xmath88",
    "does this peak dominate the spectrum .    in the case of isochronous freeze  out the situation is quite different . in fig .",
    "8 , we show results for @xmath89 . for @xmath90 ,",
    "one observes a rapidity distribution with a gaussian - like shape , because in this case freeze  out happens so early that the two maxima and the minimum at the origin as seen in the temperature distribution ( fig .  2 )",
    "are too close together to be resolved after thermal smearing ( especially since in this case the temperature is relatively high ) . also , for decreasing freeze  out temperatures there are considerable differences to the case of isothermal freeze  out .",
    "in particular , there is no maximum at central rapidity due to the time dilation effect visible in the temperature distributions .",
    "we now consider the variation of the transverse momentum spectrum with temperature . in fig .",
    "9 we present the different transverse momentum spectra for isothermal freeze  out and for the same freeze  out temperatures as above .",
    "as expected , lower freeze  out temperatures lead to steeper distributions .",
    "the corresponding spectra for isochronous freeze  out are shown in fig .",
    "due to the above mentioned reasons , the results are very similar to those of isothermal freeze  out .    a gaussian - like shape of the rapidity spectra is often claimed to be a characteristic feature of the landau expansion model @xcite . as is demonstrated in fig .  7 , this is not true in general and especially not for realistic values of @xmath32",
    ". a gaussian - like spectrum emerges _ only _ if one neglects the time - like contributions to the rapidity spectrum , which , however , dominate the sum spectra at higher @xmath32 . to illustrate this point we show in fig .",
    "11 the rapidity spectrum originating from the space - like parts of the isothermal freeze  out hypersurface .",
    "note that in contrast to fig .",
    "7 , _ all rapidity spectra have gaussian - like shapes_. the neglected time - like contributions are shown separately in fig .",
    "we have normalized the spectra in fig .",
    "11 to their maximum value at @xmath83 in order to facilitate a comparison to the results of srivastava et al.@xcite who employ this approximation .",
    "note also that their method to calculate the spectra violates the conservation laws , since it does not account for energy , momentum , entropy , or particle number streaming through the time - like parts of the freeze  out hypersurface .",
    "in this paper we have investigated freeze  out in a one  dimensional hydrodynamic model for the expansion stage of heavy  ion collisions .",
    "we have discussed two different freeze  out scenarios used in the literature , namely instantaneous freeze  out across an isothermal and an isochronous space ",
    "time hypersurface .",
    "we have found that , provided @xmath91 , the transverse momentum spectra are very similar in the two scenarios , but that there are noticeable differences in the rapidity distributions .",
    "this can be explained as follows . in our model ,",
    "the fluid evolution is only one  dimensional and variations in temperature and fluid velocity occur only along the longitudinal direction .",
    "it is obvious that they consequently have to vary along different hypersurfaces in space  time .",
    "these differences are bound to reflect themselves in the ( longitudinal ) rapidity distribution . on the other hand , the transverse momentum spectra average over the longitudinal degrees of freedom and",
    "thus are only influenced by the ( average ) temperature .",
    "the fact that the latter is the same in both scenarios naturally explains the observed similarity .",
    "if one , however , selects a particular rapidity interval for the calculation of the transverse momentum spectra , for instance midrapidity , the main contribution will come from the space - like parts of the hypersurface at z=0 , where the fluid temperature is different in the two scenarios , cf .",
    "1 . the transverse momentum spectra will reflect this difference , cf .",
    "figs .  4 and 6 .",
    "therefore , one should in general use the ( more realistic ) isothermal freeze  out scenario in three  dimensional calculations . for central collisions with cylindrical symmetry , isothermal freeze  out was already employed in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also demonstrated that an improper calculation of the particle rapidity distribution , neglecting contributions from time - like parts of the freeze  out hypersurface and thus violating the conservation laws , leads to the well  known gaussian - like shapes commonly associated with the landau expansion model .",
    "a consistent calculation , however , produces double or triple  humped distributions .",
    "future studies should on the one hand focus on a more realistic description of the decoupling of particles from regions with finite space",
    " time extent instead across an infinitely narrow space ",
    "time hypersurface . on the other hand",
    ", the feedback of the decoupling process on the evolution of the fluid has to be taken into account to obtain a fully self - consistent picture of freeze  out for the hydrodynamical description of heavy  ion collisions .",
