    "quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) oxide compounds of transition - metal elements have been studied extensively because of their exotic and superior electrical and magnetic properties , such as high - temperature superconducting cuprates,@xcite manganites with colossal magnetoresistance,@xcite and cobaltite - based thermoelectric materials , @xcite etc .. in contrast , oxychalcogenides , which also tend to adopt layered structure due to the different sizes and coordination requirements of oxygen and the heavier chalcogenide anions , are a relatively under - investigated class of solid - state compounds.@xcite among known layered tmch - based ( tm = cu , ag ; ch = s , se , te ) oxychalcogenides , there are mainly two structural types.@xcite one structural type is representative by the lnotmch series ( ln = lanthanide ) , which can be regard as the filled pbfcl - type structure and is isostructural to zrsicuas as well as iron - based superconductors lnofepn ( pn = as , p).@xcite these compounds composed of alternating ln@xmath0o@xmath0 fluorite layers and tm@xmath0ch@xmath0 antifluorite layers along @xmath2 axis have been studied intensively because of their superior and novel optical and transport properties originating from tm@xmath0ch@xmath0 layers.@xcite another important structural type is representative by the oxide antimonide sr@xmath0mn@xmath3sb@xmath0o@xmath0@xcite ( which may conveniently be formulated as sr@xmath0mno@xmath0mn@xmath0sb@xmath0 ) and related oxide pnictides.@xcite later on , this structural type is also found in sr@xmath0zno@xmath0cu@xmath0s@xmath0.@xcite in sr@xmath0zno@xmath0cu@xmath0s@xmath0 , the chalcogenide layer [ cu@xmath0s@xmath0]@xmath5 is similar to that in laocus whereas the [ sr@xmath0zno@xmath0]@xmath6 is not fluorite type but perovskite type . several oxychalcogenides with this crystal structure have been reported.@xcite    .[table1-konwn - cuse ] some typical cuch - based compounds and their ground states .

    "if we insert more bi@xmath0o@xmath0-type slabs into the compounds , we can get a series of compounds with the general formula [ a@xmath0x@xmath0(ax@xmath0)@xmath7cu@xmath0se@xmath0 ( a is metal cation , x is anion ) .",
    "one can always choose the appropriate atoms to construct the [ a@xmath0x@xmath0(ax@xmath0)@xmath7-type blocking layer by forcing the [ a@xmath0x@xmath0(ax@xmath0)@xmath7 to behave an expected valence .",

    "the [ sr@xmath0f@xmath0(srf@xmath0)@xmath7-type blocking layer is bivalent no matter how many the sr@xmath0f@xmath0-type slabs are introduced .    in the [ a@xmath0x@xmath0(ax@xmath0)@xmath7cu@xmath0se@xmath0-type compounds , the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) of such compounds",
    "are composed of the bands of cation a. when the anion x = o , in order to have a bivalent blocking layer , the valence of the cation a must be greater than or equal to + 3 .",
    "some a with high valence state can lead to very deep cbm .",
    "for example , the deep cbm of bi@xcite leads to the small gap of bi@xmath0zro@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 and the pesudogap of bi@xmath0yo@xmath3fcu@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "the deeper cbm of sn is overlapped with vbm , leading to the metallic ground states of bi@xmath0sno@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 and la@xmath0sno@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the ground state of [ a@xmath0x@xmath0(ax@xmath0)@xmath7cu@xmath0se@xmath0-type compounds can be tuned by designing the blocking layers .",
    "the small / large gap semiconductors and metals can be obtained for different applications .     the dos of [ sr@xmath0f@xmath0(sf@xmath0)@xmath7cu@xmath0se@xmath0 with ( a ) n=0 and ( b ) n=1 .",
    "the insets show the structures of the [ sr@xmath0f@xmath0(sf@xmath0)@xmath7-type blocking layers . ]",
    "in summary , we systematically studied the physical properties of layered oxychalcogenide bi@xmath0yo@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
    "it crystallizes in an unusual intergrowth structure with cu@xmath0se@xmath0 and bi@xmath0yo@xmath1 layers .",
    "bi@xmath0yo@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 exhibits metallic behavior with @xmath9-type carriers between 2 and 300 k. we obtained a rather large value of @xmath10 at room temperature .",
    "theoretical calculation confirms the quasi-2d metallic behavior of bi@xmath0yo@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 and indicates the state at fermi energy originates mainly from cu-@xmath11 and se-@xmath12 electrons .",
    "based on the comparison of the transport properties of the reported cuse - based layered compounds , we found that the ground states of the known cuse - based compounds are related to the valence electrons of their blocking layer : when the number of transferred valence electrons from blocking layer to cu@xmath0se@xmath0 layer is smaller than two per layer , the compounds would exhibit metallic behaviors ( e.g. kcu@xmath0se@xmath0@xcite , hgocuse@xcite ) , but if that number is two , they would become semiconductors .",
    "( e.g. biocuse@xcite ) .",
    "however , according to our calculations , some bi@xmath0yo@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0-type compounds may not obey the rules .",
    "the theoretical investigation of doping effects in the system indicates that the ground states of the bi@xmath0yo@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0-type compounds can be tuned by designing the blocking layers .",
    "the small / large gap semiconductors and metals can be obtained for different applications .",
    "the physical properties of other cuse - based layered compounds need to be studied in the future in order to examine our deduction .",
    "@xmath13 : in the first version , we mistyped the lattice parameters for some sample when calculating the doping effects of bi@xmath0yo@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 and la@xmath3o@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 , which influence the obtained ground states , but will not change the discussions of the properties of bi@xmath0yo@xmath1cu@xmath0se@xmath0 .",
