    "the recent discovery of large numbers of quasars at radio and x - ray frequencies with very red optical  to  near - infrared continua suggests that existing optical surveys may be severely incomplete ( eg .",

    "webster et al . ( 1995 ) and masci ( 1998 ) have argued that the anomalous colours are due to extinction by dust , although the location of the dust remains a highly controversial issue .",
    "intervening dusty galaxies which happen to lie along the line - of - sight of otherwise normal blue quasars are expected to redden the observed optical continuum , or if the optical depth is high enough , to remove quasars from an optical flux - limited sample ( eg .",

    "consequently , one then also expects that the probability of a background object being either reddened or obscured to be reduced .",
    "the effects of foreground dust on observations of objects at cosmological distances has been discussed by ostriker & heisler ( 1984 ) ; heisler & ostriker ( 1988 ) ; fall & pei ( 1989 , 1993 ) ; wright ( 1986 , 1990 ) and masci & webster ( 1995 ) . using models of dusty galactic disks ,",
    "these studies show that the line - of - sight to a high redshift quasar has a high probability of being intercepted by a galactic disk , particularly if the dust distribution is larger than the optical radius of the galaxy . based on the dust properties of local galaxies",
    ", it is estimated that up to 80% of bright quasars to @xmath3 may be obscured by dusty intervening systems .",
    "the principle issue in these calculations was that realistic dust distributions in galaxies which are ` soft ' around the edges , will cause many quasars to appear reddened without removing them from a flux - limited sample .    none of the above studies however considered the effects of evolution in dust content . cosmic evolution in dust",
    "is indirectly suggested by numerous claims of reduced chemical enrichment at @xmath4 .",

    "these estimates are consistent with simple global evolution models of star formation and gas consumption rates in the universe ( pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "if the observed metallicities in qso absorption systems are common , then their interpretation as galactic disks implies that substantial evolution has taken place since @xmath5 . if the quantity of dust on cosmic scales also follows such a trend , then one may expect the effects of obscuration to high redshift to be reduced relative to non - evolving predictions .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to model the effects of intervening galactic dust on the background universe at optical wavelengths using a more generalised model where the dust content evolves .",

    "this was based on a method introduced by wright ( 1986 ) which did not include any effects of evolution with redshift . here",
    "we generalise this model by considering the possibility of evolution in the dust properties of galaxies . in the discussion below and",

    "we assume the following properties for individual absorbing galaxies .",
    "following previous studies ( eg .",
    "wright 1986 , heisler & ostriker 1988 ) , we model galaxies as randomly tilted exponential disks , where the optical depth through a face - on disk decreases exponentially with distance @xmath15 from the center : @xmath16 @xmath17 is a characteristic radius and @xmath18 , the value of @xmath13 through the center of the galaxy @xmath19 .",
    "the redshift dependence of @xmath20 is due to the increase in absorber rest frame frequency with redshift .",
    "since we wish to model the observed @xmath0-band optical depth to @xmath21 , we require an extinction law @xmath22 that extends to wavelengths of @xmath23  .",

    "will depend on the quantity of dust formed from past stellar processes . for simplicity , we assume all galaxies form simultaneously , maintain a constant space density , and increase in dust content at a rate that is uniform throughout .",
    "we also assume no evolution in the dust law @xmath24 with redshift .",
    "even though a lower mean metallicity at high redshift may suggest a different wavelength dependence for the dust law , there is no evidence from local observations of the diffuse ism to support this view ( eg . whittet 1992 ) .",
    "we parameterise evolution in dust content by following simulations of the formation of heavy metals in the cold dark matter scenario of galaxy formation by blain & longair ( 1993a , 1993b ) .",
    "these authors assume that galaxies form by the coalescence of gaseous protoclouds through hierarchical clustering as prescribed by press & schechter ( 1974 ) .",
    "a fixed fraction of the mass involved in each merger event is converted into stars , leading to the formation of heavy metals and dust .",
    "it was assumed that the energy liberated through stellar radiation was absorbed by dust and re - radiated into the far - infrared .",
    "they found that such radiation can contribute substantially to the far - infrared background intensity from which they use to constrain a model for the formation of heavy metals as a function of cosmic time .",
    "their models show that the comoving density of heavy metals created by some redshift @xmath26 , given that star formation commenced at some epoch @xmath29 follows the form @xmath30    we assume that a fixed fraction of heavy metals condense into dust grains so that the comoving density in dust , @xmath31 , follows a similar dependence as equation ( [ omegaz ] ) . the density in dust relative to the present closure density in @xmath32 exponential disks per unit comoving volume",
    "is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the dust mass in a single exponential disk .",
    "this mass can be estimated using eq.7 - 24 from spitzer ( 1978 ) where the total density in dust , @xmath36 , is related to the extinction @xmath37 along a path length @xmath38 in kpc by @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the density and dielectric constant of a typical dust grain respectively and the numerical factor has dimensions of @xmath42 - see spitzer ( 1978 ) . using the exponential profile ( equation [ expr ] ) where @xmath43 and integrating along cylinders , the dust mass in a single exponential disk can be found in terms of the model parameters @xmath28 and @xmath17 .",
    "we find that the comoving density in dust at some redshift scales as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the central @xmath0-band optical depth and @xmath17 the dust scale radius of each disk .",

    "the extinction initially increases with @xmath26 due to a decrease in corresponding rest frame wavelength .",
    "depending on the value for @xmath47 , it then decreases due to evolution in dust content .",
    "this latter effect dominates towards @xmath47 .",
    "the characteristic galactic dust radius @xmath17 defined in equation ( [ expr ] ) is also given a redshift dependence in the sense that galaxies had smaller dust - haloes at earlier epochs .",
    "the following evolutionary form is adopted : @xmath51 where @xmath52 gives the rate of evolution and @xmath17 is now a ` local ' scale radius .",
    "evolution in radial dust extent is suggested by dynamical models of star formation in an initially formed protogalaxy ( edmunds 1990 and references therein ) .",
    "these studies show that the star formation rate and hence metallicity in disk galaxies has a radial dependence that decreases outwards at all times .",
    "it is thus quite plausible that galaxies have an evolving effective ` dust radius ' which follows chemical enrichment from stellar processes .",
    "our parameterisation for evolution in galactic dust ( equations [ tbz ] and [ rozev ] ) is qualitatively similar to the ` accretion models ' for chemical evolution of wang ( 1991 ) , where the effects of grain destruction by supernovae and grain formation in molecular clouds is taken into account .",
    "the above model is also consistent with empirical age - metallicity relationships inferred from spectral observations in the galaxy ( wheeler , snedin & truran 1989 ) , and models of chemical evolution on a cosmic scale implied by absorption - line observations of quasars ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "our model depends on four independent parameters which describe the characteristics and evolutionary properties of intervening galaxies .",
    "the parameters defined ` locally ' are : the comoving number density of galaxies @xmath32 , the characteristic dust radius @xmath17 , and dust opacity @xmath28 at the center of an individual absorber .",
    "the evolution in @xmath28 and @xmath17 is defined by equations ( [ tbz ] ) and ( [ rozev ] ) respectively . parameters defining their evolution are @xmath52 for @xmath17 , and the ` dust formation epoch ' @xmath47 for @xmath28 .",
    "both @xmath53 and @xmath54 have been conveniently combined into the parameter @xmath55 where @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the hubble length .",
    "this parameter is proportional to the number of galaxies and mean optical depth introduced along the line - of - sight ( see section  [ rests ] ) .",
    "it also represents a ` local ' covering factor in dusty galactic disks - the fraction of sky at the observer covered in absorbers .    in all calculations ,",
    "we assume a fixed value for @xmath32 . from equation ( [ tg2 ] ) ,",
    "any evolution in the comoving number density @xmath32 is included in the evolution parameter @xmath52 for @xmath17 ( equation [ rozev ] ) .",
    "thus in general , @xmath52 represents an effective evolution parameter for both @xmath17 and @xmath32 .",
    "our model is therefore specified by four parameters : @xmath55 , @xmath28 , @xmath52 and @xmath47 .",
    "our calculations assume a combination of values for the parameters ( @xmath55 , @xmath28 ) and ( @xmath52 , @xmath47 ) that bracket the range consistent with existing observations . the values ( @xmath55 , @xmath28 ) are chosen from previous studies of dust distributions and extinction in nearby spirals . from the studies of giovanelli",

    "[ comov]a and c ) predicts that the true space density can be greater by almost two orders of magnitude than that observed , while our maximal dust model ( figs .",
    "[ comov]b and d ) predicts this factor to be greater than 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "these predictions can be reconciled with the quasar number densities predicted from hierarchical galaxy formation simulations involving cold - dark matter ( eg .",
    "katz et al .",
    "it is found that there are @xmath152 times potential quasar sites at @xmath153 ( associated with high density peaks ) than required from current observations .",
    "such numbers can be easily accommodated by our predictions if a significant quantity of line - of - sight dust is present .",
    "to summarise , we have shown that with the inclusion of even weak to moderately weak amounts of evolution in dust content with @xmath26 , the bias due to dust obscuration will not be enough to flatten the true redshift distribution of bright quasars beyond @xmath123 .",
    "a significant excess however ( over that observed ) in quasar numbers is still predicted .",
    "our model predictions may critically depend on the dust properties of individual galaxies and their assumed evolution .",
    "for instance , is it reasonable to give galaxies an exponential dust distribution ? such a distribution is expected to give a dust covering factor to some redshift considerably larger than if a clumpy distribution were assumed ( wright , 1986 ) . a clumpy dust distribution",
    "( for spirals in particular ) is expected , as dust is known to primarily form in dense , molecular star - forming clouds ( wang 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "as noted by wright ( 1986 ) , `` cloudy disks '' with dust in optically - thick clumps can reduce the effective cross - section for dust absorption by at least a factor of five and hence , are less efficient at both obscuring and reddening background sources at high redshift .",
    "a dependence of the degree of dust ` clumpiness ' on redshift , such as dust which is more diffuse at early epochs and becomes more clumpy with cosmic time is unlikely to affect the results of this paper .",
    "this will only reduce the effective cross - section for absorption to low redshifts , leaving the effects to high redshift essentially unchanged .",
    "the numbers of reddened and/or obscured sources at high redshift relative to those expected in non - evolving dust models however will always be reduced , regardless of the dependence of aborption cross - section on redshift .",
    "observations of the optical reddening distribution of quasars as a function of redshift may be used to test our predictions .",
    "large and complete radio - selected samples with a high identification rate extending to high redshifts however are required .",
    "the reason for this is that first , radio wavelegths are guaranteed to have no bias against obscuration by dust , and second , the statistics at high redshift need to be reasonably high in order to provide sufficient sampling of an unbiased number of random sight - lines .    the sample of drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) contains the highest quasar fraction ( @xmath154 ) than any existing radio sample with a redshift distribution extending to @xmath155 .",
    "a large fraction of sources appear very red in @xmath156 colour compared to quasars selected by optical means .",
    "the dependence of @xmath156 colour on redshift is relatively flat which may at first appear consistent with the predictions of figure  [ meantaus ] , although the fraction of sources identified with @xmath4 is only @xmath157 .",
    "also , this sample is known to contain large numbers of sources which are reddened by mechanisms other than dust in the line - of - sight ( eg .",
    "serjent & rawlings 1996 ) .",
    "the role of dust , reddening the optical  to  near - ir continua of radio - selected quasars , and whether it is extrinsic or not still remains a controversial issue .",
    "one needs to isolate the intrinsic source properties before attributing any excess reddening to line - of - sight dust .",
    "optical follow - up of sensitive radio surveys that detect large numbers of high redshift sources with known intrinsic spectral properties will be necessary to reliably constrain the rate of evolution in cosmic dust .",
    "in this paper , we have modelled the optical depth in galactic dust along the line - of - sight as a function of redshift assuming evolution in dust content .",
    "our model depends on four parameters which specify the dust properties of local galaxies and their evolution : the exponential dust scale radius @xmath17 , central @xmath0-band optical depth @xmath28 , `` evolution strength '' @xmath52 where @xmath158 , and @xmath47 - a hypothesised dust formation epoch .",
    "our evolution model is based on previous studies of the formation of heavy metals in the cold dark matter scenario of galaxy formation .",
    "our main results are : + 1 . for evolutionary parameters consistent with existing studies of the evolution of metallicity deduced from qso absorption - line systems , a significant `` flattening '' in the mean and variance of observed @xmath0-band optical depth to redshifts",
    "@xmath159 is expected .",
    "the mean optical depth to @xmath1 is smaller by at least a factor of 3 compared to non - evolving model predictions .",
    "obscuration by dust is not as severe as shown in previous studies if effects of evolution are accounted for .",
    "+ 2 . by allowing for even moderately low amounts of evolution ,",
    "line - of - sight dust is _ not _ expected to significantly affect existing optical studies of qso evolution . correcting for dust obscuration",
    ", evolving dust models predict the ` true ' ( intrinsic ) space density of bright quasars to decrease beyond @xmath125 as observed , contrary to previous non - evolving dust models where a continuous monotonic increase was predicted .",
    "+ 3 . for moderate amounts of evolution ,",
    "our models predict a mean observed @xmath0-band optical depth that scales as a function of redshift as @xmath160 . for comparison ,",
    "evolving models predict a dependence : @xmath161 .",
    "we believe future radio surveys of high sensitivity that reveal large numbers of optically reddened sources at high redshift will provide the necessary data to constrain these models .",
