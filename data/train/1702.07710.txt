    "astronomical observations during the 20th century unveiled two of the biggest phenomena in the universe : dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the former behaves as an invisible dust matter favoring the process of gravitational clustering while the latter yields a late time acceleration of the cosmological background .",
    "it is however worth noting that such intriguing mechanisms ( or substances ) have emerged complementing the pure general relativity ( gr ) based description of gravity .    by avoiding the insertion of new unknown ingredients",
    "the search for alternative theories to gr has become a fruitful investigation route .",
    "since the gr can be modified in many distinct directions the consequence is the large number of theories available in the literature @xcite .    what is the best alternative theory ?",
    "there is no clear answer to this question .",
    "however , the set of available options has been reduced over the past years .",
    "gravitational theories can be ruled out if they do not successfully describe modern astronomical observations or because of theoretical incompatibilities and unphysical features , e.g. , the appearance of ghosts .",
    "our aim in this work is to show the inviability of one of such proposals when applied to the cosmological context .",
    "we focus on the so - called @xmath0 theory where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar and @xmath2 is the trace of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the gr case of such theory corresponds to the standard einstein - hilbert term @xmath3 in the gravitational lagrangian .",
    "this model has been introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as a possible interpretation for a running cosmological constant .",
    "then , one expects that this modification of gravity accounts for the accelerated expansion .",
    "dark matter seems therefore to be a fundamental ingredient in the @xmath0 scenario .",
    "we show that most of the available @xmath0 models in the literature do not lead to a viable cosmological background expansion .",
    "we use current available expansion data to show that in the low - redshift domain there is no compatible cosmological expansion in the @xmath0 gravity . some cases do not even lead to a late time accelerated expansion which is a well established observational fact @xcite .",
    "the indication that @xmath0 theories have difficulties in describing the linear growth of matter perturbations has been already discussed in ref .",
    "this conclusion was made however on a qualitative ground without proper comparison with observation data like the cosmic microwave background spectrum , baryonic acoustic oscilations measurements or the matter power spectrum @xmath4 .    in the next section we review the @xmath0 gravity applying it to a friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric .",
    "we discuss how realistic cosmologies are built in the realm of @xmath0 gravity pointing out some typical misunderstandings in the literature .",
    "it is convenient to bring to the reader s attention an important assumption we are going to make throughout this paper . for the riemman tensor",
    "we adopt the standard convention @xmath5 , from which the ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the first index with the third one , e.g @xmath6 .",
    "such choice is the most used by some of the main gr textbooks @xcite and is widespreadly adopted in the literature .",
    "so , we believe it is useful to emphasize this point in order to help some readers to not be misled by less usual definitions as for instance that one made by the authors in @xcite , who considers the weinberg s assumption @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the riemann tensor appears with opposite sign to that one adopted in this work , which coincides with the conventions used in @xcite . besides",
    ", it can be checked that this choice shall influence the sign of the term involving the differential operator @xmath7 . in the particular case of the reference @xcite , the authors adjust such sign difference through a proper definition for the energy - momentum tensor .    in the next section the @xmath0 theory and the corresponding equations describing the cosmological dynamics",
    "are presented . in the section",
    "iii we list three cases of @xmath0 theories which comprise most of the ones investigated in the literature . for these examples",
    "we compute the respective deceleration parameters and confront these models with the observational data for @xmath8 ( inferred from cosmic chronometers ) and supernovae type @xmath9 data .",
    "in particular , we complement the model iii analysis ( see below ) with supernovae data constraints .",
    "the section iv brings an alternative approach for the @xmath0 theory , in which such modified gravity is assumed as the underlying theoretical scenario for the dark matter hypothesis , whereas the usual cosmological constant remains responsible for the cosmic acceleration .",
    "the final section is dedicated to the discussion of our results and the concluding remarks of this work .",
    "in an @xmath0 theory the gravitational action is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the lagrangian density of the matter fields .",
    "we adopt @xmath14 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is defined in terms of the matter action as follows @xmath15 which by turn leads to @xmath16 in the metric formalism , one considers the metric tensor as the only dynamical variable of the respective gravitational theory , so that the corresponding field equations are obtained by varying the action with respect to the metric . following this procedure we get @xmath17t_{\\mu\\nu}-f_t \\theta_{\\mu\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath18 we assume the standard cosmological scenario in which the universe behaves as a homogeneous and isotropic fluid at large scales .",
    "this hypothesis is envisaged by a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker spacetime @xmath19 along with an energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid written in terms of its energy density @xmath20 and the pressure @xmath21 , @xmath22 comparing ( [ emt1 ] ) and ( [ pf ] ) we can write the lagrangian as @xmath23 , while the tensor ( [ theta ] ) reduces to @xmath24 . in this work we shall focus on a classe of @xmath0 theories where the generalized einstein - hilbert lagrangian is given by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being functions purely dependent upon @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . thus , the modified field equations are @xmath28 and @xmath29 where the prime and dot denote derivatives with respect to the argument , i.e. , @xmath30 , and to the cosmic time , respectively .",
    "a general @xmath0 model gives rise to a deviation from the usual conservation law , implying in the following form for the continuity equation @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the parameter of the equation of state , which for a barotropic fluid is given by @xmath33 .",
    "the covariant conservation of @xmath34 is an essential feature of gr , which manifests as an immediate consequence of the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory .",
    "so , it is expected that any classical gravitational theory shall in principle obey such requirement as well . in the context of interacting dark energy models , a local violation of @xmath35",
    "may be allowed by means of a possible exchange of either energy or momentum ( or both ) between the two dark components .",
    "nonetheless , even in these models this exchange occurs in such a way as to preserve the conservation of the total dark fluid .",
    "differently , the equation ( [ consfrt ] ) shows a non - conservation of the matter - energy content as a whole , revealing a significant drawback of this class of @xmath0 theories . in light of this , in @xcite the authors imposed by hand the fulfillment of ( [ consfrt ] ) by setting to zero the expression inside the bracket , e.g @xmath36 . by using a chain rule",
    ", one can get rid of the time derivatives and write this constraint condition as a second order differential equation for the function @xmath27 , whose integration provides a solution in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are integration constants .",
    "we may avoid the trivial case @xmath40 by assuming the necessary condition @xmath41 .",
    "also , @xmath42 is adopted in order to assure that @xmath43 . considering a dustlike matter ,",
    "for which @xmath44 , the solution above becomes @xmath45 the authors then argued that this model should represent the only viable @xmath0 theory , as it constitutes the only case in which the standard conservation law is preserved , what implies in automatically ruling out anyone else .",
    "this result imposes an stringent restriction on the @xmath0 gravity .",
    "they used such viable @xmath0 model to study the linear evolution of matter density perturbations within the sub - hubble regime and assuming a quasi - static approximation .",
    "however , they found an inconvenient scale dependence for the dynamics of the perturbations which would strongly disagree with expected results , but not properly comparing such prediction with data . nevertheless , ref .",
    "@xcite already brings the message that @xmath0 theories are disfavored .",
    "our purpose in this work aims to reinforce at background level the difficulties these @xmath0 theories showed to experience at perturbative regime , which can undermine them as a viable way out to explain the observed universe .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we will concentrate our attention on the @xmath0 theories obeying the form @xmath46[sol ] the simplest and trivial choice for the @xmath1 dependence corresponds to the einstein - hilbert @xmath47 term .",
    "this is the way to study how the material corrections given by @xmath27 promote deviations from gr . with he following choice @xmath48 we can cover most of the proposed @xmath27 functions in the literature .",
    "the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the subscript appearing in @xmath51 refers to the respective powers of the term @xmath52 in ( [ frt ] ) .",
    "given @xmath47 , let us recall that the departure from gr encoded in ( [ frt0 ] ) means a minimal coupling between the curvature and the energy - momentum tensor , so that the presence of matter fields constitutes an essential condition for the effects of the modification of gravity to be perceived .",
    "so , there are two possible ways to recover gr from ( [ frt ] ) : setting the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath51 to zero or merely considering the vacuum case , @xmath53 .",
    "but , notice however that the latter case is degenerated with the choice @xmath54 . besides , it is easy to notice that the gr plus cosmological constant can be obtained by fixing @xmath55 along with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "so , in order to ensure that @xmath0 behaves as a regular function at the vacuum limit ( which as mentioned above shall coincide with gr vacuum ) , it is reasonable to assume positiveness for the powers of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath58 .    given the barotropic equation of state @xmath33 the background expansion in a flrw universe can be written in terms of the fractionary density @xmath59 , where the critical density reads @xmath60 , @xmath61\\omega^{n},\\ ] ] where we have defined the constants @xmath49 and @xmath51 , in terms of new dimensionless parameters @xmath62 in the standard cosmology matter one considers pressureless matter @xmath63 , then @xmath64 where the scale factor today is set to the unity @xmath65 . in a flat @xmath66cdm cosmology @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is barely noticed in the literature that expansion ( [ h1 ] ) imposes the following constraint on @xmath69 , @xmath70.\\ ] ] therefore , the usual interpretation of the parameter @xmath71 as being a fraction of the today s critical density of the fluid does not trivially apply when @xmath72 or @xmath73 though since energy density is a positive definite quantity the requirement @xmath74 imposes lower bounds on the @xmath75 and @xmath76 values .",
    "since @xmath0 theories are supposed to explain the accelerated expansion i.e. , the dark energy phenomena , we assume for simplicity that @xmath20 represents the total matter distribution .",
    "it is a resonable approximation to neglect now the @xmath77 contribution in the baryonic sector .    in the standard cosmology",

    "we investigate now whether the cosmologies provided by models i , ii and iii pass the test of describing available background data . for the figs .",

    "in this paper the viability of the @xmath0 models in the cosmological realm was discussed .",
    "we employed such theories to address the two main dilemmas of the modern cosmology - the dark energy and dark matter .",
    "as such , we replaced such dark components by @xmath0-like modifications of the standard gravity . among many possible shapes for @xmath0 we selected those ones",
    "which are often used in the literature whose forms can be encoded in the choice @xmath138 .",
    "this choice branches off into the models i , ii , iii presented in the third section of this article .",
