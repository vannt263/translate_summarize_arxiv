    "in the present paper we report the results of our analysis of the ccfr collaboration data @xcite on the structure function @xmath0 .",
    "the particular emphasis of the analysis is to constrain the higher twist ( ht ) contributions to the structure function from data .",
    "the ht effects in the @xmath0 structure function are of particular interest because of certain theoretical predictions made in the framework of infrared renormalon technique @xcite . an attempt to constrain the ht terms from the ccfr / nutev collaboration data",
    "was done in @xcite , where the @xmath2 structure function was written as the sum of two terms , @xmath3 with @xmath4 the leading twist contribution and @xmath5 the ht term .",
    "an important observation which follows from the analysis @xcite is that the magnitude of the ht term depends on the level to which the perturbation theory analysis of @xmath4 is applied .",
    "if @xmath4 is evaluated in a leading order ( lo ) renormalization group formalism a large @xmath6 appears from the fit .",
    "when a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) formalism is used for @xmath4 a somewhat smaller but still substantial contribution from the ht term is needed .",
    "if @xmath4 is evaluated to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) very little room is left for the ht term .",
    "we note that qcd analysis of data implies that data are given for isolated proton and neutron . in practice ,",
    "due to the reason of statistics , neutrino data are taken mainly on nuclear targets rather than on isolated proton and neutron .",
    "for example , the ccfr / nutev collaboration uses the iron target , the ihep - jinr neutrino detector uses the aluminum target @xcite , and the forthcoming data from chorus collaboration is obtained on the lead target @xcite ) .",
    "it is known from muon and electron dis experiments , that nuclear effects are quite essential in a wide kinematical region of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the emc effect at large @xmath7 , nuclear shadowing at small @xmath7 , for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the separation of nuclear effects from data introduces certain corrections to qcd analysis of data .",
    "all these motivate us to make a new analysis of the ccfr neutrino data taking into account corrections due to nuclear effects .",
    "our analysis involves two steps . in section [ nucl - eff ]",
    "we discuss our approach to calculate nuclear structure functions and to correct data for nuclear effects , and then in section [ qcd - fit ] we report the results of qcd analysis of corrected data . in sect .",
    "[ summary ] we summarize .",
    "in order to apply corrections for nuclear effects in our analysis we first calculate the `` emc ratio '' for the iron target , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the structure function of a heavy nucleus of @xmath11 nucleons and @xmath12 the structure function of an isolated isoscalar nucleon .. ] then we extract the structure function of an isolated isoscalar nucleon from the ccfr data , @xmath13 .",
    "bulk of neutrino data with @xmath14gev@xmath15 is located in the region of @xmath16 . for this kinematical regime",
    "it is usually assumed that nuclear dis of leptons from nuclear targets can be viewed as incoherent scattering from bound nucleons .",
    "major nuclear effects found in this region are due to nuclear binding @xcite and fermi motion @xcite and off - shell modification of bound nucleon structure functions @xcite . for the simplest nuclear system , the deuteron , the relation between the deuteron and the nucleon @xmath2 structure function reads as follows @xcite , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the deuteron wave function which describes the probability to find the bound proton ( or neutron ) with momentum @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the bjorken variable of the bound nucleon with the four - momentum @xmath21 which is given by the difference of the target four - momentum and the four - momentum of the spectator nucleon .",
    "eq.([f3d ] ) is written for the target rest frame and the axis @xmath22 is chosen along the direction of momentum transfer , @xmath23 . in this reference frame",
    "@xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the deuteron and the nucleon mass respectively and @xmath27 is the ` velocity ' of the virtual boson .",
    "note that the bound proton and neutron are off - mass - shell and their structure functions depend on the nucleon off - shellness @xmath28 as an additional variable .    for the scattering off a heavy nucleus of @xmath11 nucleons",
    ", there appears a rich spectrum of spectator nuclear states of @xmath29 nucleons , over which we have to sum .",
    "the nuclear structure function is then given by equation similar to ( [ f3d ] ) where we have to substitute the deuteron wave function by nuclear spectral function @xmath30 and introduce an additional integration over the energy spectrum of spectator states @xcite , @xmath31 where the sum is over protons ( @xmath32 ) and neutrons ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the nucleon four - momentum @xmath34",
    ". the proton and neutron spectral functions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are normalized to the number of bound protons ( @xmath37 ) and neutrons ( @xmath38 ) respectively .",
    "heavy nuclei , such as iron @xmath39fe@xmath40 , generally have got unequal numbers of protons and neutrons with an excess of the latter over the former .",
    "the neutron excess is generally small , @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , it is a good approximation to assume that the neutron and the proton spectral functions calculated per one particle are equal , @xmath42",
    ". then we find from ( [ f3a ] ) , @xmath43 where the averaging is done with respect to the isoscalar spectral function , @xmath44 .",
    "the last term in ( [ n - z ] ) gives a correction due to excess of neutrons in a nucleus .",
    "we notice that the sign of this correction is different for neutrino and anti - neutrino scattering .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 the parton distributions of corresponding quarks in the target ( we neglect for simplicity the contributions due to @xmath48- and @xmath49-quarks ) . since the neutron has more @xmath46-quarks than the proton has ( in the valence quark region ) , the neutrino - neutron structure function is larger than the proton one , @xmath50",
    ". therefore @xmath51 receives a positive correction due to excess of neutrons . repeating this argument for anti - neutrino scattering , we find that the corresponding correction is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign ( i.e. negative ) . therefore the @xmath52 correction vanishes for the structure function averaged over neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "similar discussion can also be applied to the @xmath53 structure function .",
    "one can also see that the @xmath52 correction is negative for the charged leptons scattering , i.e. for the @xmath54 structure function .    as it is obvious from ( [ f3a ] )",
    ", calculation of nuclear structure functions requires the knowledge of nuclear spectral function . in the next section",
    "we discuss the nuclear spectral function used in the present calculation in more detail .",
    "nuclear spectral function @xmath55 determines the probability to find the nucleon with the momentum @xmath56 and ( non relativistic ) energy @xmath57 in the ground state of the nucleus and can be written as follows @xmath58 here the sum is over the quantum numbers of the whole set of the residual states of @xmath29 nucleons which includes the bound states as well as the sates in continuum , @xmath59 is the annihilation operator of the nucleon with momentum @xmath56 and polarization @xmath60 , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are respectively the energy of the residual nucleus and the ground state energy of the target nucleus .",
    "the residual system balances momentum of the removed nucleon and acquires the recoil energy @xmath63 though its effect is small for heavy nuclei .",
    "the nuclear momentum distribution is @xmath64 the integration of the spectral function over energy and momentum gives the number of bound nucleons @xmath11 .",
    "the spectral function ( [ sf ] ) determines the rate of nucleon removal reactions such as @xmath65 that makes it possible to extract the spectral function from experimental data .",
    "the picture of the spectrum of residual states as revealed from these experiments with heavy nuclei can be summarized as follows . for small energies and momenta which is for heavy nuclei @xmath66mev / c .",
    "the corresponding fermi energy is of order @xmath67mev . ]",
    "the energy spectrum of residual states follows to that predicted by the mean field model of the nucleus , i.e. it consists of the set of sharp peaks whose positions can be identified with the energies needed to separate bound nucleons from the occupied single particle levels in the nuclear mean field . the deviations from the mean field picture become significant at high momentum @xmath56 and high nucleon removal energy @xmath57 .",
    "the widths of the resonances increase as @xmath57 increases as well as the positions of the peaks move from that predicted by the energy independent mean field model . at high energy",
    "the spectral function is dominated by contributions from the states with one and more nucleons in the continuum .",
    "these contributions are due to nn - correlations in the nuclear ground state and can not be accounted for within the mean field model .",
    "the calculation of the nuclear spectral function for complex nuclei requires to solve many body problem .",
    "the latter is known to be a difficult task and presently can be done only within certain approximations . in our discussion we follow @xcite and consider a phenomenological model for the spectral function which incorporates both the single particle nature of the spectrum at low energy as well as high energy and high momentum components due to nn - correlations in the ground state .- function in ( [ sf ] ) . ] to this end we separate the full spectral function ( [ sf ] ) into two parts , @xmath68 which correspond to contributions from low excitation energy intermediate states ( @xmath69 ) and high excitation energy states ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the low energy part can be approximated by the sum of the energy @xmath71-functions which pick the positions of the occupied single particle levels weighted with the corresponding wave functions squared . in practice",
    "we use an approximate expression instead where the sum over occupied levels is substituted by its average value , @xmath72 with @xmath73 the nucleon separation energy averaged over residual configurations of @xmath29 nucleons with low excitation energies , i.e. mean field configurations , and @xmath74 the corresponding part of the nucleon momentum distribution .",
    "the high energy part @xmath70 is determined by excited states in ( [ sf ] ) with one or more nucleons in the continuum .",
    "it was observed within many body calculations @xcite for a wide range of nuclei that nuclear momentum distributions at high momenta @xmath75 with @xmath76 the fermi momentum ) run parallel to the deuteron distribution @xmath77 , @xmath78 where the normalization constant @xmath79 incorporates the many body aspects of the problem .",
    "it was found @xcite that the constants @xmath79 increase from @xmath80 for @xmath81he to @xmath82 for @xmath39fe .",
    "going to a larger mass number does not bring in more high momentum component , @xmath83 for nuclear matter . )",
    "does not hold at low momentum where @xmath84 contributes only a little to the full momentum distribution . ]",
    "this observation finds a simple interpretation if one assumes that high momentum component is generated by ground state configurations with a correlated nn - pair with a small distance between the nucleons .",
    "one can expect therefore that the relative motion in the nn - pair is determined by the properties of the nn - interaction in the vacuum rather than by long range nuclear interactions , and the distribution in the relative momentum will be similar to momentum distribution in the deuteron .",
    "in terms of the spectral function @xmath70 this corresponds to the assumption about the dominance of the contribution from the states with one nucleon in the continuum and the remaining @xmath85 nucleons being in a state with low momentum and low excitation energy , @xmath86 the coprresponding matrix element in ( [ sf ] ) is then determined by the wave function of the nn - pair embeded into nuclear environment , @xmath87 we assume here factorization into the wave functions describing the relative motion in the nn pair , @xmath88 , with relative momentum @xmath89 and the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion of the pair in the field of @xmath85 nucleons , @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "in general @xmath92 depends on the quantum numbers of the state of @xmath85 nucleons , however the corresponding dependence of the @xmath93 is weak .",
    "we substitute ( [ factor ] ) into ( [ sf ] ) and sum over the spectrum of @xmath85 nucleons states and obtain an approximate expression for @xmath70 , @xmath94 here @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the relative and the cm momentum distributions respectively and @xmath97 is the energy needed to separate two nucleons from the ground state averaged over configurations of @xmath85 nucleons with low excitation energy .",
    "note that the minimum two nucleon separation energy @xmath98 is of order of @xmath99mev for medium range nuclei like @xmath39fe .",
    "the factorization of the matrix element ( [ factor ] ) into the relative and the cm motion wave functions is justified if relative momentum in the nn - pair is large relative to the cm momentum of the pair .",
    "this can be written as @xmath100 .",
    "this condition allows us to approximate ( [ p1 ] ) by taking the relative momentum distribution out of the integral over the cm momentum at the point @xmath101 .",
    "then we have , @xmath102 where the averaging is done with respect to the cm motion of the pair . from the latter equation",
    "it is clear that the high momentum part of nuclear momentum distribution is given by the relative momentum distribution in the correlated nn pair embedded into nuclear environment , @xmath103 .",
    "the characteristic momentum for the cm motion of the nn - pair is similar to the one in the mean field model .",
    "in fact the averaged cm momentum squared of the pair can be estimated from the balance of the overall nucleus momentum @xcite , @xmath104 , where the sum is taken over all bound nucleons and the averaging is performed with respect to the intrinsic wave function of the nucleus .",
    "this gives @xmath105 , with @xmath106 the mean value of the squared single nucleon momentum .",
    "since , by our assumption , the cm distribution does not include high - momentum component , we should also exclude the contribution of high - momentum part in estimating @xmath106 .",
    "we follow @xcite and parameterize the cm momentum distribution of the correlated nn pair in the field of other @xmath85 nucleons by a gaussian distribution , @xmath107 with the parameter @xmath108 determined from the averaged cm momentum of the pair , @xmath109 .    using ( [ ncm ] )",
    "we find that the integration over the cm momentum in ( [ p1-av ] ) can be done analytically and finally the result reads , @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath111 are respectively the minimum and the maximum cm momenta allowed by the energy - momentum conservation in ( [ p1 ] ) for the given @xmath57 and @xmath56 , @xmath112 we notice that @xmath113 has the interpretation of the maximal allowed cm momentum in the correlated nn - pair in the direction transverse to @xmath56 for the fixed @xmath57 and @xmath114 .",
    "note that the separation energy @xmath57 is negative , as it follows from its definition in ( [ sf ] ) .",
    "the condition @xmath115 determines the threshold value of @xmath57 for the fixed @xmath114 .",
    "in numerical evaluations we use the parameterizations for @xmath74 and @xmath84 of @xcite , which fit nicely the results of many body calculation of nuclear momentum distribution .",
    "it follows from this calculation that low momentum part incorporates about 80% of the total normalization of the spectral function while the other 20% are taken by the high momentum part .",
    "the mean kinetic energy obtained from integration of the full momentum distribution @xmath116 for the iron nucleus is @xmath117mev ( the share of the high - momentum component @xmath118 is about 20mev ) .",
    "the two parameters , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , determine characteristic range of nucleon separation energy .",
    "we set @xmath121mev , and therefore neglect possible contributions due to excited states of @xmath85 nucleons in ( [ p1 ] ) .",
    "excited states would lead to an overall increase of nucleon separation energy .",
    "we believe , however , that concrete estimates of this effect would require us to go beyond the model discussed in the present paper ] in order to fix the parameter @xmath119 we employ the koltun sum rule @xcite , which gives the relation between mean separation energy @xmath122 , mean kinetic energy @xmath123 , and the ground state energy per nucleon @xmath124 . for the mean kinetic energy of @xmath125mev the sum rule gives @xmath126mev . by integrating our model spectral function",
    "we find the value @xmath127mev which satisfies the koltun sum rule .      in fig.[emc_ratios",
    "] we compare the iron / deuterium ratios for the charged lepton structure function @xmath130 and the neutrino and antineutrino averaged structure function @xmath2 , calculated with the model nuclear spectral function discussed above .",
    "also shown are the bcdms @xcite and the slac @xcite data on the iron / deuterium @xmath53 structure function ratios . in numerical calculations",
    "we use the cteq4 parameterizations for the nucleon parton distributions @xcite .",
    "we see that the behavior of the ratio @xmath129 is very similar to that of the ratio @xmath128 ( for large @xmath7 and large @xmath8 this does not come as a big surprise , since both @xmath53 and @xmath0 are determined by valence quarks in this region ) .",
    "a small difference between the @xmath128 and @xmath129 curves is due to the neutron excess correction . as it was discussed in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , the @xmath130 structure function receives a negative @xmath52 correction , while similar correction cancels out in the neutrino and antineutrino averaged structure functions .",
    "it is well known , that the depletion of nuclear structure functions at @xmath131 is due to nuclear binding effect @xcite , while the rise of the ratios at large @xmath132 is due to nuclear momentum distribution effect ( fermi motion ) .",
    "we recall also that bound nucleons are off - mass - shell .",
    "off - shell effects in the structure functions appear as the dependence on the target invariant mass @xmath28 .",
    "target mass corrections can be of two different kinds .",
    "first of all , we have to take into account ` kinematical ' target mass dependence due to finite @xmath133 ratio . to this end",
    "we use the nachtmann scaling variable @xcite @xmath134 instead of the bjorken variable @xmath135 .",
    "other ( ` dynamical ' ) sources of @xmath28-dependence of structure functions are also possible . in this respect",
    "we refer to a model where @xmath28-dependence of structure functions appears in the leading order @xcite .",
    "we note also here , that we take into account off - shell effects in the bound nucleon structure function in a way that it does not affect the number of valence quarks in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the off - shell effect acts coherently with nuclear binding effect and leads to an additional suppression of nuclear structure functions at intermediate range of @xmath7 .",
    "the ratio @xmath128 follows quite closely to data on the emc effect in the iron nucleus ( see fig .",
    "[ emc_ratios ] ) .",
    "this gives us the confidence in our method to calculate the emc effect in the @xmath2 structure function .",
    "our qcd fit proceeds as follows . the nucleon structure function @xmath136 is written as a sum of the leading twist and the high twist terms , ( [ ltplusht ] ) .",
    "we parametrize @xmath137 at some scale @xmath138 in terms of a simple function , @xmath139 then we apply the renormalization group equation in order to calculate evolution of @xmath137 with @xmath8 .",
    "we solve the renormalization group equation in the leading ( lo ) , next - to - leading ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leadig ( nnlo ) logarithm approximations of qcd .",
    "in doing so we expand the leading twist structure function @xmath140 in terms of its mellin moments within the framework of the jacobi polinomial method and then apply the evolution equations to the moments ( for more detail on the method used see @xcite ) .    it should be noticed that in general the higher twist terms can be of two kinds : those which have the kinematical nature , e.g. the terms due to finite target mass , and those which arise due to higher twist operators and reflect the quark - gluon interaction effects in the target ( `` pure '' higher twists ) . in order to ensure that the higher twist term in ( [ ltplusht ] ) describes effects due to quark - gluon interaction in the target",
    "we explicitly take into account the kinematical corrections due to finite target mass . to this end",
    "we substitute the mellin moments by the nachtmann moments @xcite in the the jacobi polinomial expansion of the leading twist structure function @xmath137 .",
    "the ccfr data points are given in terms of discrete @xmath7-bins structure which range from @xmath141 to @xmath142 .",
    "we fit 116 data points with @xmath8 in the range between @xmath143gev@xmath15 and @xmath144gev@xmath15 .",
    "the fit parameters are the parameters @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 of ( [ xf30 ] ) at the scale @xmath148 , the values of the function @xmath149 at the center of each @xmath150-bin , as well as the qcd scale parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we fix the parameter @xmath151 by normalizing ( [ xf30 ] ) to the gross - llewellyn - smith sum rule , which was calculated in qcd to the second order in @xmath152 @xcite , @xmath153 .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ht ] for the lo , nlo and nnlo approximations to the evolution equation . also shown",
    "are the results with and without applying corrections for nuclear effects .",
    "we found that the fitting parameters are stable for @xmath154gev@xmath15 and have chosen @xmath155gev@xmath15 for the results presented in fig .",
    "the present fit includes more experimental points than that of @xcite . in particular",
    ", the inclusion of low-@xmath8 data points into the fit allows us to reduce the error bars in @xmath6 as compared to those presented in @xcite . though we should notice some increasing theoretical uncertainties associated with low @xmath8 data included into our analysis .",
    "we found that , in general , our present fit agrees with @xcite , though introduces certain corrections especially at large @xmath7 .",
    "a special care was taken to insure that our method to separate target mass correction is self - consistent .",
    "in particular we have done a special fit with @xmath149 fixed at values presented in fig .",
    "[ ht ] , but let the mass parameter in the nachtmann moments to be free .",
    "we found that the minimum of @xmath156 corresponds to the value of the mass parameter about @xmath157gev with an error about @xmath158gev .",
    "this value only weakly depends on the order of perturbative analysis and is close to the proton mass , that gives us confidence in the method used .    as one",
    "can clearly see from fig .",
    "[ ht ] the magnitude of the higher twist effects depends on the level to which the perturbation theory analysis of @xmath4 is done .",

    "the shape of @xmath6 in nlo is in a qualitative agreement with the prediction of infrared renormalon approach @xcite .",
    "in particular , we found that the function @xmath6 is negative in the region @xmath159 .",
    "the separation of nuclear effects from data leads to a further suppression of the higher twist term @xmath6 at all levels of perturbation theory analysis of @xmath4 .",
    "the effect of nuclear corrections on @xmath6 is most pronounced at large @xmath7 , where we observe a systematic reduction of @xmath6 as compared with no - nuclear - effects analysis .",
    "nuclear corrections result in the decrease of the values of the function @xmath6 at @xmath160 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ ht ] , the central points of @xmath6 at @xmath161 and @xmath142 bins become negative in contrast to the infrared renormalon prediction for large @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "an attempt to take into account nuclear effects in the qcd fit was previously done in @xcite .",
    "we comment in this respect that authors of @xcite used the deuteron model for nuclear effects , which is not a realistic one for the iron target .",
    "in particular , we found that @xmath6 is negative for large @xmath7 , while it was positive in @xcite .",
    "authors of @xcite attempted to introduce nuclear corrections to qcd fit in terms of the moments of structure functions .",
    "however , it was incorrectly assumed in @xcite , that the nuclear structure function @xmath162 as @xmath163 , that , to our mind , caused the @xmath156 increase in their qcd fit .",
    "we found that the scale parameter @xmath1 decreases for about @xmath164mev after nuclear effects are taken into account .",
    "this will lead to a shift of @xmath165 for about @xmath166 . within the nnlo fit we get @xmath167mev for four quark flavors .",
    "in the present paper we report the results of our qcd analysis of ccfr data on @xmath2 structure function . the main emphasis was put on the extraction of higher twist contribution from data .",
    "we took special care to separate nucler effects from data , and compare the results of both analyses with and without corrections for nuclear effects .",
    "we found that nuclear effects cause about 10% decrease in the @xmath1 value .",
    "our analysis confirms the observation made earlier , that the magnitude of higher twist terms decreases strongly when going from lo to nlo , and then to nnlo , approximations to the evolution equation .",
    "we observe an additional suppression of higher twist terms when corrections due to nuclear effects have been applied .",
    "in conclusion we note that small-@xmath7 region in @xmath2 structure function is of particular interest , where a strong nuclear shadowing effect is anticipated @xcite .",
