    "relativistic hydrodynamics is classically based on the euler system of perfect compressible fluids , which enjoys many properties such as the existence of a symmetrization and , consequently , an initial value formulation ; see @xcite .",
    "our purpose in the present paper is to introduce a generalization of this model , which enjoys essentially the same algebraic and analytical structures , while possibly encompassing a larger class of fluid behaviors .",
    "+ our model , in short , is as follows : we require a tensor @xmath0 on @xmath1 ( viewed as spacetime ) of the form @xmath2}.\\ ] ] here the ` energy density ' @xmath3 is given as a function of @xmath4 , which in turn plays the role of the ` current density ' on spacetime .",
    "the field equations are then given by the system of conservation laws @xmath5 the equations ( [ new])-([model ] ) reduce to the relativistic euler system when @xmath3 depends on @xmath4 only via the particle number density @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the minkowski metric .",
    "similarly , when @xmath7 is a general lorentzian metric and partial derivatives in ( [ model ] ) are replaced by covariant ones , we obtain the isentropic euler system on a general relativistic spacetime .",
    "since the results in the present paper only concern the leading - order part of the basic field equation , these results apply to both special and general relativistic fluids .",
    "let us however point out that our generalized model does not require any metric , so the only concept of derivative which is a priori available is that coming from the affine structure of @xmath1 , i.e. partial derivatives . + provided that @xmath8 is non - vanishing , the equations ( [ model ] ) imply the conservation law @xmath9 an outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we begin with the concept of ` convex extension ' of a system of conservation laws and its bearance on symmetric hyperbolicity .",
    "that is basically classical material due to @xcite , but in a ` covariant ' setting , i.e. without a given splitting of spacetime into space and time . in section 3",
    "we motivate the model given by ( [ model ] ) in terms of standard special relativistic continuum mechanics and show that it generalizes the relativistic euler system .",
    "our main result concerning the existence of a convex extension and a symmetric hyperbolic form is stated in section  4 and proven in section  5 .",
    "this result sheds new light on and generalizes the findings of @xcite . in section  6",
    "we sketch a uniqueness result related to weak solutions for which the conservation law @xmath10 is replaced by the inequality @xmath11 across hypersurfaces of discontinuity .",
    "this section is essentially a spacetime version of a classical result in @xcite .",
    "we consider equations for variables @xmath12 of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 the number of spacetime dimensions and - quantities is played by the field @xmath4 and the vector @xmath16 is simply @xmath4 itself . ]",
    "we also assume the convention that @xmath18 is a partial derivative with respect to the variable appearing in parenthesis after the quantity @xmath19 ( @xmath20 in the present case ) .",
    "all fields are assumed to be sufficiently smooth .",
    "we observe that it would be irrelevant for our purpose if zeroth - order terms in @xmath21 were present or @xmath22 would also depend on @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that there exists a ` non - characteristic covector ' , i.e.  a covector @xmath24 such that the vector @xmath25 is an invertible function of @xmath21 .",
    "if we introduce @xmath26 as a new dependent variable together with a coordinate system @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) such that @xmath29 ( where without loss of generality we assume that @xmath24 is chosen to be constant ) , then ( [ cons ] ) takes the form @xmath30 this is the form in which systems of conservation laws are usually written ( which we call the ` standard form ' ) , whereas we prefer to keep our equations in spacetime form . as will become clear below , the variable @xmath26 , besides the condition that it exists , plays only a transitory role in our analysis .",
    "suppose next that ( [ cons ] ) implies the equation @xmath31 in which the quantity @xmath32 is usually called an ` entropy - entropy flux pair ' .",
    "it follows from ( [ cons ] ) that there exist quantities @xmath33 such that @xmath34 to see this , we work in the standard form above and we write ( [ ext ] ) as @xmath35 but for ( [ ext1 ] ) to hold identically for all functions satisfying ( [ cons1 ] ) it is necessary that @xmath36 now setting @xmath37 , one checks that all components of ( [ 1 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "eq.([1 ] ) in turn implies @xmath38}(f)= 0\\ ] ] and thus the system of equations @xmath39 is ` symmetric ' .",
    "if @xmath33 is invertible , we can alternatively substitute @xmath40 for @xmath21 in ( [ cons ] ) to obtain the system of conservation laws @xmath41 which by simple linear algebra is again symmetric on grounds of eq.([implies1 ] ) .",
    "eq.([1 ] ) can be interpreted as saying that @xmath40 is the gradient of the quantity @xmath42 with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore we have @xmath43 thus definiteness of @xmath44 is equivalent to that of @xmath45 .",
    "now the symmetry of @xmath46 together the with positive definiteness of @xmath47 exactly says that the second equation in ( [ implies2 ] ) is symmetric hyperbolic with subcharacteristic covector @xmath24 .",
    "so we have obtained the statement that the system of conservation laws ( [ cons ] ) , in terms of @xmath48 , is symmetric hyperbolic with subcharacteristic covector @xmath24 if and only if @xmath49 is a convex function of @xmath26 .",
    "the system just described is called a conservation law with convex extension @xmath49 .",
    "( cf .  with the statements in @xcite . )",
    "many models of continuum mechanics , including elastic materials and perfect fluids in special relativity , can be written in the form @xmath50 where the tensor @xmath0 is constructed as follows : let @xmath3 , the ` energy density ' , be a function of maps @xmath51 from @xmath1 into @xmath52 of the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , assumed to have maximal rank 3 .",
    "here @xmath1 , the collection of independent variables , plays the role of spacetime and @xmath52 is the ` material manifold ' , which should be thought of as an abstract collection of points labelling the particles making up the material continuum .",
    "then the euler - lagrange equation for the action @xmath55 is equivalent to ( [ div ] ) with @xmath56 it is a system of four quasilinear second - order partial differential equations for the map @xmath57 , of which three are independent , since @xmath58 .",
    "consider next the particle number current given by the spacetime vector @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are respectively volume forms on @xmath52 and @xmath62 .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is conserved in the sense that @xmath63 holds as a kinematical identity independently of the field equations .",
    "we now consider a class of theories , which we call ` generalized hydrodynamics ' models , in which the lagrangian @xmath3 is required to depend on @xmath64 only via @xmath4 .",
    "then , using the identity ) implies @xmath65 , which is nothing but the euler identity for homogenous polynomials of degree 3 . ] @xmath66},\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath67 i.e. eq.([new ] ) .",
    "we now change our viewpoint by regarding the equation @xmath68 as a system of four conservation laws with the four components of @xmath4 being the dependent variables .",
    "an important special case is where @xmath1 is endowed with the minkowski metric @xmath7 of signature @xmath69 and @xmath3 depends on @xmath4 , and @xmath4 only via the quantity @xmath70 in particular @xmath4 is assumed to be timelike .",
    "then we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 with a prime denoting derivative with respect to @xmath15 . in that case",
    ", the equation ( [ div ] ) is the relativistic euler equation for an isentropic perfect fluid .",
    "similarly , when @xmath75 is replaced by a curved lorentz metric @xmath40 and the derivative in ( [ div ] ) is replaced by the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath40 , we obtain the general relativistic euler equations .",
    "for the model proposed in section 1 , we can now state our main result .    .15 cm    * theorem . * _ define @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and let @xmath78 be non - vanishing .",
    "suppose furthermore that @xmath79 has lorentz is in our convention minus that of spacetime . ]",
    "signature @xmath80 and that @xmath4 is timelike with respect to @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath81 . then the system @xmath68 , with @xmath0 as in ( [ t ] ) , admits a convex extension given by @xmath82 , where @xmath24 is any timelike covector with respect to @xmath79 , that is , @xmath83 which is ` future - pointing ' in the sense that @xmath84 has the opposite sign as @xmath85 . _",
    ".15 cm    importantly , in view of the discussion in section  2 , the symmetrization implied by this theorem guarantees the local well - posedness of the initial value problem ( with sufficiently regular initial data ) for the model of generalized fluids , which can thus be viewed , at least from a mathematical perspective , as a viable model for hydrodynamics .    before proving this proposition",
    "we again look at the isentropic perfect - fluid case , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 the quantity @xmath79 is of course nothing but ( a rescaling of ) the acoustic metric of the fluid .",
    "our assumptions are equivalent to the conditions that @xmath88 and @xmath89 both be positive .",
    "the first of these further implies that @xmath15 , whence @xmath90 can be seen as a function of @xmath3 . consequently @xmath91 thus we have that @xmath92 and @xmath93 have to be positive .",
    "the first condition is related to the dominant energy condition ( dec ) for perfect fluids - though the condition @xmath94 is not needed .",
    "the second condition means that the sound velocity is real and positive .",
    "so our main theorem , in the case of fluids , is valid provided that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "by a computation we find @xmath97 } = b_\\mu \\,\\delta_\\sigma{}^\\nu - 2 a_{\\sigma \\tau } j^{[\\tau } \\delta_\\mu{}^{\\nu]},\\ ] ] which implies @xmath98 thus , since @xmath99 , ( [ div ] ) implies the conservation law @xmath100 and the @xmath16 - quantity in ( [ ext ] ) of section 2 is simply given by @xmath101 .",
    "the role of the @xmath102 - quantities of the previous section is now played by @xmath103 provided that @xmath104 and @xmath105 are both non - vanishing , the jacobian @xmath106 has an inverse .",
    "the proof is by computing @xmath106 and explicitly inverting the associated system of linear equations .",
    "we omit a detailed proof , since we can directly read off the analogue of the @xmath48 - quantities of ( [ 1 ] ) , here called @xmath107 , from the first equation in ( [ tj1 ] ) , written as @xmath108 thus our system is symmetric in terms of the variable @xmath107 given by @xmath109 provided that the map sending @xmath4 to @xmath107 is invertible . to check this latter fact ,",
    "we calculate @xmath110,\\ ] ] which has the inverse @xmath111.\\ ] ] next we use @xmath112 as the new dependent variable in the partial differential equation given by @xmath68 and thus compute @xmath113 giving @xmath114.\\ ] ] the symmetry of @xmath115 in @xmath116 is of course not accidental , see ( [ implies2 ] ) in the previous section . + next , by our assumptions , the covector @xmath117 is future - pointing timelike with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "we now compute @xmath118 which in fact is positive definite .",
    "this is easily seen by applying the quadratic form given by the left - hand side of ( [ apply ] ) to @xmath4 and any vector orthogonal to @xmath4 in the @xmath79 - metric .",
    "thus we have found one subcharacteristic covector , and so our system is symmetric hyperbolic in the @xmath107 - variables .",
    "since @xmath119 is timelike with respect to @xmath120 and @xmath121 has the opposite sign of @xmath122 , the statement of our proposition requires that we have to show positive definiteness of @xmath123 holds for any covector @xmath124 inside the same cone as @xmath125 . for that purpose",
    "we first need to understand the structure of the characteristic variety @xmath126 .",
    "this is defined by the space of non - zero @xmath24 s for which @xmath127 $ ] is zero .",
    "this can be computed with the result that @xmath128 thus the space of characteristic conormals is the union of two ( ` future ' and ` past ' ) conical hypersurfaces - the ` sound cones ' given by @xmath129 - and a hyperplane outside these cones given by @xmath130 .",
    "the interior of the sound cones are respectively two convex cones ( in the sense that @xmath131 for @xmath132 belongs to these sets when @xmath124 and @xmath26 do ) .",
    "now let @xmath124 be future - pointing .",
    "it is then in the same convex cone as @xmath125 .",
    "this , in turn , is equivalent to the polynomial in @xmath133 given by @xmath134 having at most negative zeros . but",
    "zeros of this polynomial are nothing but the negative of the eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor @xmath135 , relative to the positive definite quadratic form given by @xmath136 .",
    "thus these eigenvalues ( all of which have to be real ) are positive , whence @xmath135 is positive definite .",
    "this completes the proof of our theorem .",
    "in order for functions @xmath20 to ( [ cons ] ) to have shocks , i.e.  be discontinuous across a hypersurface @xmath137 , yet be a solution of ( [ cons ] ) in the distribution sense , one finds by a standard argument that there has to hold @xmath138 n_\\mu = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is the conormal of @xmath137 , assumed to be everywhere non - characteristic , and @xmath140 $ ] denotes the jump across @xmath137 .",
    "the idea , then , in the theory of entropy solutions of ( [ cons ] ) is to replace ( [ ext ] ) by the condition that @xmath141 hold in the distribution sense . in applications",
    "the conserved quantity associated with @xmath16 for strong solutions can e.g.  be negative entropy or energy . in our case ,",
    "perhaps interestingly , it will be particle number .    namely , consider the model of generalized hydrodynamics presented in section  3 for which the condition ( [ ext2 ] ) reads @xmath142 by following the technique in @xcite and taking advantage of the convexity property we established in our main theorem , we reach the following conclusion : if a smooth solution to the generalized hydrodynamics model exists , then it is unique even in the broad class of weak solutions , so long as it satisfies the inequality ( [ j-2 ] ) .",
