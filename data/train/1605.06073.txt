    "<S> our results provide a route to classify the effects of the manipulation of the activity . ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows that the cytoplasm of cells behaves as a strong glass former material , and when atp is depleted the system becomes more fragile @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cytoplasms of cells consist of many molecular motors and higher atp concentration will drive more motors to be in the active state , which will increase @xmath47 ( eq . </S>",

    "<S> this is effectively increasing @xmath96 [ eq . </S>",

    "<S> active glasses present an open challenge for physics theory , and the main advances in this field relied so far on numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite have produced data indicating the opposite roles of the active parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our model provides analytic expressions that give excellent description of available numerical simulation results , and resolves the seeming contradiction between the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we trace this behavior to the kinetic energy of a caged active particle , which makes our results qualitatively independent of the exact form of the inter - particle interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between the increased mobility and increased particle aggregation , which are both generated by activity , leads to fascinating physics and may play important roles in different biological processes in living organisms .    </S>",
