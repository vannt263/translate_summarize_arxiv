    "in @xcite v.e . adler derived a quadrilateral lattice equation as the nonlinear superposition principle for bcklund transformations ( bts ) of the krichever - novikov ( kn ) equation @xcite .",
    "this equation can be written as follows , cf .",
    "@xcite @xmath0[({\\widetilde}{u}-b)({\\widehat}{{\\widetilde}{u}}-b)-(a - b)(c - b)]+\\\\   b[(u - a)({\\widetilde}{u}-a)-(b - a)(c - a)][({\\widehat}{u}-a)({\\widehat}{{\\widetilde}{u}}-a)-(b - a)(c - a)]\\\\   = abc(a - b ) , } \\label{eq : ellform}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denote the values of a scalar dependent variable defined as a function of the independent variables @xmath2 .",
    "the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 in ( [ eq : ellform ] ) are related points on the weierstrass elliptic curve and can be written in terms of the weierstrass @xmath6-function : @xmath7 the main integrability property of this equation is that of multidimensional consistency , cf .",
    "@xcite , which implies that solutions of eq .   can be covariantly embedded in a multidimensional lattice such that they obey simultaneously equations of a similar form ( albeit with different choices of the lattice parameters ) in all twodimensional sublattices .",
    ".   emerged as the most general equation in a classification of scalar quadrilateral lattice equations integrable in this sense , @xcite , which includes the previously known cases of lattice equations of korteweg - de vries type , cf .",
    "furthermore , connections have been established between adler s equation and other so - called elliptic integrable systems , @xcite , in particular the elliptic toda lattice of i. krichever @xcite and the elliptic ruijsenaars - toda lattice @xcite . among 2d scalar discrete integrable equations ,",
    "adler s equation has thus been revealed as remarkably pervasive , making its study of singular importance .",
    "one well established procedure to obtain explicit solutions is the application of bts on known , perhaps elementary , solutions of the lattice equation .",
    "this is particularly natural here as the multidimensional consistency implies that the bt is inherent in the lattice equation itself .",
    "however , in order to implement the bt one needs an initial solution : the _ seed _ solution , and the establishment of elementary solutions that qualify as seed solutions turns out already to be a delicate problem in the case of adler s equation .",
    "the resolution of this problem , and the subsequent construction of soliton solutions using the bt , is the main achievement of this paper .",
    "we will study adler s equation in a different form from , which was found in @xcite , namely @xmath8 where the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related to eachother and can be expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions with modulus @xmath12 , namely by introducing the points @xmath13 ( the primes denoting derivatives w.r.t .",
    "the first arguments of the jacobi functions ) on the elliptic curve @xmath14 it was pointed out by v. adler and yu .",
    "suris to one of us that the _ weierstrass form _ ( [ eq : ellform ] ) and the _ jacobi form _ ( [ eq : hieform ] ) of adler s equation are equivalent in the sense that there exists a mbius transformation of the variables together with a bi - rational transformation of the parameters that takes one form into the other , @xcite .",
    "we adopt here the jacobi form because the analysis leading to the solutions is simpler than in the weierstrass form . for that purpose",
    "it is useful to view the relation between the parameters in terms of the abelian group structure on the elliptic curve which can be defined through the following rational representation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it can be verified by direct computation that the product in the group @xmath18 defined in this way is associative and it is obviously commutative , and furthermore the identity is @xmath19 and inverse of a point @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "thus , we consider the lattice parameters of to be the points @xmath22 and @xmath23 on @xmath24 , while @xmath25 which expresses the relation @xmath26 in terms of the uniformising variables introduced in .",
    "in fact , this relation encodes the addition formulae for the relevant jacobi functions , where @xmath27 can be seen as the point obtained by a shift of @xmath20 on the elliptic curve defined by the point @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , it is well known that a symmetric biquadratic equation defines a shift on an elliptic curve , see for example @xcite , and this can be made explicit by introducing the symmetric biquadratic @xmath29 from the factorisation @xmath30 we see that @xmath31 is satisfied if @xmath32 or @xmath33 , i.e. , if @xmath34 in terms of the uniformising variables , and in this way @xmath35 defines an addition formula for jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "the biquadratic @xmath36 is connected to a symmetric _ _",
    "tri__quadratic in terms of the three variables @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , now appearing on equal footing , given by @xmath37 which also defines a shift on the same curve by the statement that @xmath38 if @xmath39 or @xmath40 where @xmath41 , ( the latter being a branch point of the curve @xmath24 ) .",
    "this triquadratic is mbius related to a similar triquadratic expression for weierstrass elliptic functions , and the latter , which was also used by adler in @xcite , plays a similar role in the analysis of as the biquadratic @xmath36 in the construction for that will follow below .    in terms of the points @xmath20 , @xmath28 on the curve @xmath24",
    "it is now useful to introduce the quadrilateral expression @xmath42 in terms of which takes the form @xmath43 we note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related by the equations @xmath46 and @xmath47 cf .",
    "@xcite , where in we have suppressed the arguments and subscripts of @xmath48 in order to make room for partial derivatives with respect to the arguments .",
    "the cubic consistency of adler s equation , @xcite , means that given one solution , @xmath49 , of the pair of ordinary difference equations for @xmath50 @xmath51 are compatible and , moreover , if @xmath50 satisfies this system it is also a solution of .",
    "we say that forms an auto - bcklund transformation ( bt ) for .",
    "the new solution @xmath50 may depend not only on @xmath49 but also on the bcklund parameter @xmath52 and on one integration constant .    for adler s equation in jacobi form we can easily verify the solution @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath55,@xmath56 are as defined in .",
    "it turns out , however , that this solution is not suitable as a _",
    "seed _ for constructing soliton solutions using the bt .",
    "in fact for the equations for @xmath50 are reducible and have only two solutions which we label @xmath57 and @xmath58 , given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the uniformizing variable associated with @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "in fact is nothing more than extended into a third lattice direction associated with the bt , ( hence the notation with @xmath57 interpreted as forward shift on @xmath49 in the direction of the bt , and @xmath58 as a backward shift ) .",
    "this is an idea which we will use later and refer to as a covariant extension of the solution .",
    "since the action of the bt only trivially extends , application of the bt on the solution clearly does not lead to essentially new solutions .",
    "therefore , in order to find soliton solutions for adler s equation we require a _ germinating _ seed solution , i.e. , a solution on which the action of the bt is non - trivial .",
    "we proceed by making the hypothesis that there exists a solution of which is a fixed - point of its bt , i.e. , which is constant in a third lattice direction associated with a particular bcklund parameter @xmath62 . in that case",
    "the bt reduces to the system @xmath63 although cubic consistency by itself does not guarantee that such fixed points exists , i.e. , that the system is compatible , we will show that for adler s equation such a solution indeed arises and provides a germinating seed . to find such solutions we begin by considering first the equation of involving the shift @xmath64 . from the expression this is quadratic and symmetric in @xmath49 and @xmath65 , and",
    "hence can be viewed as a quadratic correspondence having @xmath66 images on the @xmath67 iteration .",
    "what is not obvious is that as a multivalued map this correspondence commutes with its counterpart , the map @xmath68 defined by the second equation of , but this will become apparent below . directly from we obtain the biquadratic @xmath69 and comparing this with the general expression for @xmath36 , with @xmath9 replaced by @xmath49 and @xmath10 replaced by @xmath65 we are led to introduce a new parameter @xmath70 defined by @xmath71 for later convenience we use the symbolic notation @xmath72 to denote the correspondence between the original parameter @xmath20 and the @xmath73-deformed parameter @xmath74 , given by the relations .",
    "thus , we can now write @xmath75 bringing to the standard form of the biquadratic addition formula for the jacobi elliptic functions . as before , this defines a group law on an elliptic curve of the same type as but with now a new modulus @xmath76 , namely @xmath77 the deformed parameter @xmath74 is a point of this deformed curve , @xmath78 , as can be verified by direct computation using the fact that the seed parameter and the original lattice parameter lie on the original curve ,  @xmath79  .",
    "what tells us , is that the solution of the first part of the fixed point equation can be parametrised in terms of jacobi elliptic funtions associated with the deformed curve @xmath80 , and thus by introducing uniformizing variables on @xmath80 we can write the solution explicitly as follows .",
    "setting @xmath81 , @xmath82 and then @xmath83 here the deformed lattice parameter @xmath84 is related in a transcendental way to the original lattice parameter @xmath55 through either of the equivalent relations : @xmath85    however , so far we have only dealt with the first part of ; we must also solve simultaneously the second part .",
    "the crucial observation is that deformed curve that emerges in the solution of the first part is _ independent of the lattice parameter @xmath20 characterising the direction in the lattice_. thus , if we proceed in precisely the same way with solving the second equation in we get exactly the same curve @xmath80 and hence the parametrisation of the solutions of the latter can are given by the shifts on the curve as follows @xmath86 where we have now introduced the deformed variable @xmath87 , again through the correspondence @xmath88 , and parametrizing @xmath89 in terms of a deformed uniformizing variable @xmath90 .",
    "the latter parameter obeys similar relations to with @xmath55 replaced by @xmath56 , but involving the same modulus @xmath76 .",
    "now , clearly on the curve @xmath80 the maps given in and commute , and this implies the compatibility of the solutions of both members of , i.e. , we have a simultaneous solution which is the required seed solution we are looking for . in explicit form",
    "this new seed solution can be expressed as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "we note that the seed solution @xmath93 , distinguished by the label @xmath73 , reduces to the non - germinating seed in the limit @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 , the unit on the curve .",
    "the equations and clearly have other solutions as well , corresponding to the choice of sign at each iteration , and these lead to different seeds . as a particular example",
    ", an _ alternating seed solution _ can be obtained by chosing a flip of sign at each iteration step of the seed map .",
    "we will refer to as the canonical seed solution .",
    "we will now show that the canonical seed solution germinates by applying the bt to it , i.e. , by computing the one - soliton solution . we need to solve the simultaneous ordinary difference equations in @xmath50 @xmath96 which define the bt @xmath97 with bcklund parameter @xmath52 .",
    "the seed itself can be covariantly extended in the lattice direction associated with this bt , that is we may complement with the equation @xmath98 , where the @xmath99 denotes a shift in this new direction which is associated with the parameter @xmath52 and as before @xmath100 is the uniformizing variable for @xmath101 defined by the relation @xmath102 .",
    "the problem of solving the system can be simplified because this covariantly extended seed provides two particular solutions , i.e. , @xmath103 ( compare with the non - germinating seed for which these were the only solutions . ) from the multilinearity of the equations are discrete riccati equations for @xmath50 .",
    "the key observation is that since these equations share two solutions they can be simultaneously reduced to homogeneous linear equations for a new variable @xmath104 by the substitution @xmath105 after some manipulation the system for @xmath104 found by substituting into can be written as @xmath106 where we mildly abuse notation by introducing the modified parameters @xmath107 ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 do not depend on lattice shifts ) .",
    "we take as the defining equations for @xmath104 , which we refer to as the plane - wave factor .",
    "the compatibility of this system for @xmath104 can be verified directly , specifically @xmath110 as a consequence of the identity for the jacobi @xmath111 function @xmath112 the one - soliton solution for the jacobi form of adler s equation , which we denote by @xmath113 , is thus given by @xmath114 with @xmath115 as in and @xmath104 defined by .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite adler s equation goes to the krichever - novikov ( kn ) equation in a particular continuum limit .",
    "we give this limit by first introducing the formal analytic difference operator @xmath116 and hence continuous variables @xmath117 and @xmath118 . by writing @xmath119 and @xmath120 the variable @xmath49 on the lattice",
    "can be reinterpreted as a sampling of @xmath49 at points on the @xmath121 plane . in the limit as @xmath122",
    "we find @xmath123 i.e. , adler s equation goes to the kn equation . in the same formal limit the equations and go to @xmath124 respectively , that is the auto - bt for the kn equation , cf .",
    "@xcite , and the equation for its seed solution .",
    "we note that other compatible differential - difference equations can also be obtained in this way , for example by writing @xmath125 and taking the limit @xmath126 , adler s equation goes to @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "to compute the seed solution of one can solve coupled with itself , or alternatively one can take a continuum limit of the seed solution for adler s equation . either way the calculation is straightforward and we find @xmath129 where @xmath130 is an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "this can be verified as a solution of directly ( and for fixed @xmath118 as the general solution of ) .",
    "calculation of the one - soliton solution proceed by the continuum limit of and , or by substitution of the continuous seed solution into followed by the identification of two particular solutions ( this time from an extension of the continuous seed solution defined by together with @xmath131 ) .",
    "this calculation gives the one - soliton solution for as @xmath132 with @xmath133 as in .",
    "here @xmath134 is the continuous plane - wave satisfying the following ode in terms of @xmath117 @xmath135 and where the @xmath118 dependence can be found by the substitution of into itself .",
    "note that in the above the square roots in @xmath136 and @xmath137 refer to same choice of branch wherever they appear .",
    "in this letter we have given solutions to adler s lattice equation in its jacobi form . the seed solution is found as a fixed - point of the auto bcklund transformation ( bt ) for this equation , and application of the bt ( with different bcklund parameter ) to the seed solution yields the one - soliton solution .",
    "the construction of the seed solution requires a deformation of the original elliptic curve in terms of which the lattice parameters of the equation were given .",
    "it seems that there are interesting modular transformations that arise through this construction .",
    "the one - soliton solution involves some functions which are solutions of a consistent set of first order homogeneous , linear , but non - autonomous , equations involving the seed solution .    in order to calculate higher soliton solutions it suffices to apply the permutability condition of the bts , which is once again implicit in the original lattice equation introducing parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 and taking for @xmath49 the seed solution and for @xmath65 and @xmath140 the one - soliton solutions with bcklund parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively",
    "this leads to a 2-soliton solution which is a rational function of the seed and the soliton solution .",
    "these results and other details will be given in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "with one exception ( the lattice schwarzian kdv equation ) the methodology presented here works for all equations in the classification of adler , bobenko and suris @xcite , and a list of these solutions has been obtained which will be included in @xcite .",
