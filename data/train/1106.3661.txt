    "despite increased interest in molecular electronics and tremendous advances in the theoretical description as well as experimental characterization of the conductance of single molecule junctions in the last two decades , there has been a shortage of novel ideas for molecular devices .",
    "recently , two concepts emerged which received a lot of attention within the field : i ) devices based on quantum interference ( qi ) effects  @xcite and ii ) theromelectric applications ( ta )  @xcite .",
    "qi devices are utilizing the wave nature of electrons and the resulting possibility for destructive interference of transmission amplitudes for the design of data storage elements  @xcite , transistors  @xcite or logic gates  @xcite , and qi is also the cause for the observed low conductance of a benzene contacted in the meta configuration as compared to the para and ortho configurations  @xcite .",
    "it has been rationalized by a variety of different physical pictures , such as phase shifts of transmission channels or interfering spatial pathways@xcite .",
    "more recently , research in qi has been extended to aromatic molecules of increasing size  @xcite as well as incoherent transport in the coulomb blockade regime  @xcite and also led to proposals for the usage of molecular interferometers in spintronics  @xcite .",
    "thermoelectric materials on the other hand can convert thermal gradients to electric fields for power generation or vice versa for cooling or heating which makes them useful as peltier elements .",
    "the efficiency of a thermoelectric material is measured by a dimensionless number , the figure of merit @xmath2 , which includes the thermopower @xmath3 , the average temperature @xmath4 , the electronic conductance @xmath5 , and the total thermal conductance @xmath6 , which has contributions from electrons ( @xmath7 ) as well as from phonons ( @xmath8 ) . in appendix",
    "a we show how these quantities are calculated .",
    "materials with @xmath9 are regarded as good thermoelectrics , but @xmath10 3 would be required to compete with conventional refrigerators or generators  @xcite .",
    "the optimal thermoelectric material has a high thermopower and high electronic conductance but a low thermal conductance .",
    "one way to optimize @xmath11 is thus to increase the thermopower .",
    "it is instructive to consider an approximate formula for the thermopower  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy dependent electron transmission function .",
    "this formula is valid at low temperatures and at energies not too close to transmission resonances . by inspection of eqn .",
    "( 1 ) it becomes obvious that a large thermopower can be achieved if the transmission function changes rapidly around the fermi energy .",
    "this property therefore provides a link between qi and ta in the sense that qi effects can create steep declines in the transmission function for certain molecules .",
    "although quite good thermo - electric characteristics have also been predicted for some systems with the qi induced minimum surrounded by two maxima symmetrically  @xcite , ideally the minimum is closer in energy to one molecular resonance where the transmission has a maximum thus creating a very asymmetric transmission function , which naturally results in a steep transmission gradient in the respective energy range . in studies of mesoscopic quantum waveguides such asymmetric peak shapes caused by qi",
    "are usually referred to as fano resonances,@xcite which are not limited to electron transport but a quite general phenomenon in physics.@xcite they occur due to the interference between two wave amplitudes , one corresponding to a continuous state and the second to a localized state , and were originally observed in the line - shapes of inelastic electron scattering by helium atoms , where the continuous state was defined by the background scattering process and the localized one by the process of autoionization  @xcite .    as an illustrative example of the effect of transmission function asymmetry on @xmath3 and @xmath11",
    ", we consider a model system with a transmission function described by the fano function @xmath14 the defining feature of a fano resonance is that the resonance profile of the scattering cross section can be brought into this form . in fig .",
    "[ fig.fanoshapes ] ( a ) we plot the transmission function @xmath13 in eqn .   for three different values of the shape parameter @xmath15 giving rise to a symmetric dip ( @xmath16 ) , an asymmetric fano - shape ( @xmath17 ) and a symmetric transmission peak ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "panels ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig.fanoshapes ] show the corresponding thermopower and @xmath11 , respectively . clearly the asymmetric transmission function gives the largest thermopower and @xmath11 . at lower temperature and smaller @xmath19-values",
    ", the transmission peak will result in significantly higher @xmath3 and @xmath11 , but the asymmetric fano - shape will always give larger values than the symmetric transmission dip .",
    "( a ) transmission function , ( b ) thermopower , and ( c ) purely electronic contribution to the thermoelectric figure of merit zt@xmath20 ( i.e. the phonon contribution to the thermal conductance is neglected ) .",
    "the different curves are calculated from the general fano - transmission function giving a symmetric dip for @xmath16 ( dashed red ) , an asymmetric fano - shape for @xmath17 ( solid blue ) , and a symmetric peak for @xmath21 ( dash - dotted black ) .",
    "the temperature is @xmath22k and the broadening parameter is @xmath23ev . ]",
    "although the antiresonances found in mesoscopic electron waveguides with stub - tuners  @xcite can be classified as fano resonances , because there the direct transmission supported by a continuum of states within a periodically extended wire interferes with the states localized in the stub , the analogy does not hold for single molecule junctions where the continuum of the electrode states is interrupted by the junction which acts as a tunnelling barrier  @xcite .",
    "but even if the analogy is reduced to a similarity , asymmetric qi features ( which at least resemble fano resonances ) have been observed also in the transmission functions describing electron transport through single molecules  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the general principle that electron waves propagating from the left to the right electrode can interfere with localized states in the junction can also apply in the coherent tunnelling regime .",
    "what has been lacking so far , however , is a systematic investigation of the dependence of the peak shape of qi induced transmission dips on characteristic features of the structure of the single molecule in the nanojunction , which could match the level of understanding which has been achieved for mesoscopic waveguides .",
    "recently , we established a relation between molecular structure and the occurrence or absence of qi transmission zeros , which could be formulated in terms of simple graphical rules  @xcite . in the current article",
    "we aim at developing a framework which allows to project the characteristic features of molecular wires with one side group , which are most similar to the mesoscopic stub - tuner , onto simple tight - binding ( tb ) models . even for such relatively simple molecules",
    "there are structural elements such as the chemical nature of the side group or its exact position on the wire contributing to the peak - shape in a way that is not self - evident . in our article",
    "we pursue a step - by - step approach to this problem where we first ask the question how the transmission peak shape and thermoelectric properties are related to the parameters in a two - site tight binding model in general mathematical terms .",
    "then we relate this model to the topology of the @xmath0 states of conjugated organic molecules with side groups and where this process results in chemically stable molecular structures validate our conclusions with first principle electron transport calculations .    analytical tb results for a two - site tb model ( f ) according to eqns .",

    "( a ) transmission function @xmath4 as a function of the electron incident energy @xmath26 ( with @xmath27ev ) and ( b ) @xmath28 as a function of the side group ao energy @xmath29 with the mo - ao coupling @xmath30ev ( red ) , 0.5 ev ( black ) and 1.0 ev ( green ) .",
    "( c ) @xmath13 ( with @xmath31ev ) and ( d ) @xmath28(@xmath32 ) for @xmath33ev ( red ) , @xmath34ev ( black ) and @xmath35ev ( green ) . panel ( e ) shows the purely electronic thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath36 calculated from the transmission functions in panel ( c ) . ]",
    "the tb - model , which we introduce in the following aims at a separation of the structural aspects governing the peak shape of the interference dips , where analytical expressions can be derived for the transmission function in dependence on just two parameters . for achieving this aim",
    "we make a few simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that only the @xmath0 electrons are relevant in the energy range of interest , which allows us to describe the molecules within a tb model with only one @xmath1 atomic orbital ( ao ) for each carbon- or hetero - atom . in a second step ,",
    "we look at molecular orbitals ( mos ) of the t - stub wires without the side group attached , which can be obtained by diagonalizing the tb - hamiltonian for a chain of carbon atoms with a certain length and from them pick the single mo which is closest in energy to the @xmath1 ao or fragment orbital of the side group .",
    "if we now assume a two - site single - particle picture where the transmission function for electrons incident on a molecular junction with an energy @xmath26 is dominated by this mo and its interaction with the side group ao , it can be written as @xmath37 as derived in appendix b , with @xmath38 being the lead coupling within a wide band approximation , @xmath39 the wire mo energy , @xmath29 the side group ao energy and @xmath40 the coupling between them .",
    "for an illustration see fig .",
    "[ fig.tbanalytical ] ( f ) .",
    "as explained above the thermoelectric properties of a molecular junction can be optimized if the transmission function rapidly changes from a minimum to a maximum . as a simple measure of",
    "how rapidly the transmission function changes we consider the energetic difference @xmath28 between the transmission minimum and the closest maximum .",
    "it follows from eq . that the transmission is zero at energy @xmath41 ,  @xcite while for transmission peaks with @xmath42 the quadratic equation @xmath43 has to be solved where we made the substitution @xmath44 and set @xmath45 without loss of generality for our following arguments .",
    "the solutions to this equation @xmath46 and the norm of their differences with the energy of the transmission zero @xmath47 can then be obtained as @xmath48 and @xmath49 there will always be one solution for @xmath50 which will be closer to zero than the other . in other words only under this condition will the energy difference of the two transmission maxima from the one transmission minimum be asymmetric for the two - site model , while for @xmath51 we get @xmath52 and the peak shape around the minimum in @xmath13 will therefore be symmetric . in the following",
    "we will refer to the smaller of the two solutions for @xmath50 as @xmath28 , which we use as a measure indicative of thermoelectric efficiency where we expect the thermopower to be high for small @xmath28 .",
    "we also find in practice that in most cases a small value for @xmath28 indicates a high level of asymmetry in the peak shape around the minimum of the transmission function but this argument can not be made in general , where a ratio of the two solutions should be used instead .",
    "another conclusion at this point is that @xmath50 is completely independent of the lead - coupling @xmath38 .",
    "this independence of rapid transmission changes from lead - coupling broadenings is a general advantage of utilizing qi since both transmission peaks and transmission minima are defined entirely by the molecular topology .",
    "temperature effects can , however , smear out very sharp features when @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.tbanalytical ] we illustrate explicitly for the two - site model how the shape of the transmission function changes with the size of @xmath40 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath54 ( panel ( c ) ) , where the peak shapes are found to be the more asymmetric , the larger @xmath54 is and the smaller @xmath40 .",
    "the variation of @xmath28 with @xmath55 and @xmath40 are shown in panels ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "we note that these two parameters correspond to the length and height of the tunnelling barrier introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite for a separation of the sidearm in mesoscopic waveguide t - stubs , where the authors also found that distinctly asymmetric line shapes only start to appear for weak coupling and large barrier heights .",
    "figure [ fig.tbanalytical ] ( e ) shows the purely electronic @xmath36 ( phonon contribution to thermal conductance is neglected ) corresponding to the transmission functions in panel ( c ) .",
    "clearly the maximum @xmath36 values increase when the transmission function becomes more asymmetric , in correspondence with the findings in fig .",
    "[ fig.fanoshapes ] .",
    "while very large @xmath36 values have been predicted for symmetric transmission functions@xcite , the results in fig .",
    "[ fig.tbanalytical ] ( e ) show that asymmetric transmission functions are even more promising for a thermoelectric purpose .",
    "in order for our two - site model to be useful for the analysis of t - stub molecular wires we need to be able to deduce the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath54 from the full topology of the wires @xmath1 aos including the side group , which does not always have to be another carbon - site . for this",
    "we start from an ao - tb - model where the onsite energy of each @xmath1 orbital of the carbon chain @xmath56 is set to zero and the couplings between neighbouring sites @xmath57 are defined as -2.9 ev . from a diagonalization of the chain _ without _ the side group , where we refer to appendix c for the full mathematical details , we obtain its mo energies and the orbital weight on each chain site for each mo . within this scheme we can vary the side group ao energy @xmath58 and an initial value for the mo - ao coupling @xmath59 freely so that it reflects the side groups chemical nature .",
    "this initial value for @xmath59 is then multiplied by the orbital weight at the chain site to which the side group is bonded in order to derive the coupling parameter @xmath60 .",
    "the relevant mo is typically the one closest in energy to @xmath58 with a finite value for @xmath60 .",
    "the two site model finally contains this latter mo ( with energy @xmath61 ) and the side group ao , where the lead coupling @xmath38 in the two - site model is derived from the wide band lead coupling @xmath19 used in the full ao - tb model multiplied by the squared orbital weight on the terminal sites in the chain . in figs .",
    "[ fig.scheme ] and  [ fig.scheme1 ] we illustrate how this works in practice and which kind of information can be obtained from such an analysis . at this stage",
    "we distinguish the chemical nature of the side groups only by their onsite energies and define @xmath62ev for all the calculations illustrated in the two figures .",
    "but even with @xmath59 fixed to a given value , @xmath60 does vary with the mo topologies as discussed below .",
    "the side groups in our ao - tb model are always single aos which for multi - atom groups such as ch@xmath63 and no@xmath63 represent fragment orbitals ( fos ) where we explain in appendix d how to obtain from dft calculations the onsite energy of the fo most relevant to the qi effect .",
    "we want to stress that the ao - tb model we use in this section is only meant to investigate topological effects in a meanfield description . as we point out in the following , some of the topologies we study here would represent radicals or diradicals if they are translated into chemical structures and for a realistic description of their behaviour in a single molecule transport junction a multi - determinant approach would be needed  @xcite .",
    "this is , however , not our focus in this article where the ao - tb model is meant to provide a bridge between the 2-site analysis in the previous section and the negf - dft calculations in the next section . for the latter we limit our discussion only to junctions which are chemically stable and well described within a single - determinant approach .",
    "[ fig.scheme ] focuses on molecular wires containing a side group x with @xmath64ev simulating a ch@xmath63 group .",
    "this is attached to a chain with nine atoms ( in the following referred to as c9 ) at the fifth ( c9 - 5 , fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]a ) and fourth ( c9 - 4 , fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]b ) site , respectively , and to a chain with eight atoms ( in the following referred to as c8 ) at the fourth site ( ( c8 - 4 , fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]c ) . in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme ] we show the molecular topologies , where only c9 - 5 represents a chemically stable system , while c8 - 4 would be a radical and c9 - 4 even a diradical if the side group is linked to the chain by a double bond .",
    "nevertheless it is instructive to compare the three scenarios on a tb level in order to show that while there is no topological limit preventing transmission peak asymmetry for molecular chains with ch@xmath63 side groups , in practice such molecules will always have rather symmetric transmission peaks due to a selection criterion defined by chemical stability .",
    "the solid black lines in the transmission functions in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme ] are the results of full tb ao calculations including the side group , while the dashed red and blue lines come from 2-site tb mo models considering only the side group ao and the homo ( red ) or homo-1 ( blue ) of the unsubstituted chain , respectively . for c9 - 5",
    "the qi feature in @xmath13 is quite symmetric and the black line well reproduced by the red line meaning that just considering the homo and the side group ao is sufficient for describing the line shape . the green line in fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]a shows the tb ao result without the side group , where it can be clearly seen that the peak in @xmath13 corresponding to the homo splits into two when it hybridizes with the side group ao , whereas the other two visible peaks corresponding to the homo-1 and lumo remain unaffected .",
    "the situation is quite different for c9 - 4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]b ) , which exhibits a distinctly asymmetric qi feature and the red line does not reproduce the black one at all and instead represents a single site lorentzian peak at the homo energy .",
    "the blue line on the other hand shows very good correspondence with the tb ao transmission , which means that the side group ao interacts mainly with the homo-1 and not with the homo .",
    "our findings can be understood in terms of the topologies of the mos plotted in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme ] , where the homo has a high weight on site 5 but none on site 4 and in contrast the homo-1 has its largest weight on site 4 and none on site 5 .",
    "if @xmath61 defines the energy of the mo closest to @xmath58 with a relatively high coupling parameter @xmath60 , these differences in mo topologies also mean that for c9 - 5 @xmath65ev is substantially smaller than the value for c9 - 4 ( 1.49 ev ) , which explains why in the latter case the qi line shape is much more asymmetric according to the general trends shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.tbanalytical ] .",
    "we note that due to the symmetry properties of the mos relevant to our analysis c9 - 3 gives a transmission function similar to that of c9 - 5 , and c9 - 2 is similar to c9 - 4 , which we checked but do not show here .",
    "if the carbon chain has one site less ( c8 , fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]c ) no such dependency on the position of the side group can be identified simply because the homo has a finite localisation on all sites 3 - 6 , and therefore @xmath66ev for all cases . due to the spread out homo localisation pattern , however , @xmath67ev for c8 - 4 , which explains why it shows a somewhat more asymmetric line shape than c9 - 5 in fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]a , where @xmath68ev .",
    "the topologies in fig .  [ fig.scheme ] cover all the inequivalent possibilities for wires with nine or eight carbon atoms in the chain with a single ch@xmath63 side group .",
    "we found that only one of them is chemically stable ( c9 - 5 ) and this one has a symmetric transmission minimum . since there is no reason to assume that shorter or longer wires would result in mo topologies markedly different from those investigated , one has to conclude that such t - stub molecules with a ch@xmath63 side group are unlikely to exhibit asymmetric transmission shapes in general .",
    "[ fig.scheme1 ] now addresses the question what happens if we choose different side group aos y and z with onsite energies @xmath69 and 1.5 ev , respectively for simulating the effect of o and no@xmath63 , while we keep the same value for @xmath59 as in the study on the ch@xmath63 substituted wires with side group orbital x above .",
    "interestingly , although the position of the minimum in @xmath13 is different ( since it is always identical to @xmath58 for molecular wires with one side group  @xcite ) , it can be already said by visual inspection that there is a close correspondence of the peak shape patterns encountered in fig .",

    "[ fig.scheme1 ] .",
    "[ fig.scheme1]a and b , which mimic c9 - 5-o and c9 - 5-no@xmath63 wires , respectively , are very similar to the one mimicking the diradical c9 - 4-ch@xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig.scheme]b .",
    "this is because they exhibit again quite high values for @xmath70 , namely 0.91 ( with respect to the homo-2 ) for c9 - 5-y and 1.5 with respect to the homo for c9 - 5-z .",
    "c8 - 4-z ( fig .",

    "as a next step we test our tb predictions and their interpretation on the basis of 2-site mo models by performing dft based electron transport calculations  @xcite for the transmission function of the four molecules shown in the insets of fig .",

    "while this is not true for the radical c9-no@xmath63 - 5 , there is still some justification for studying the respective junction with a dft approach , since the nitro group can stabilize radicals at least as transition states in conjugated @xmath0 systems via the mesomeric effect .",
    "we also derive the tb parameters for projecting the transport characteristics of these molecules onto 2-site models from the same calculations .",

    "these results demonstrate that for an efficient and robust way of implementing qi induced transmission minima for thermoelectric applications an asymmetric transmission function with a transmission peak located close to the minimum in a chemically stable structure is needed . since our analysis covers a large part of the chemical possibilities for t - stub type molecules , i.e. simple wires with one side group , one has to conclude that more complex probably aromatic molecules need to be investigated systematically with regard to their suitability for thermoelectric devices .",
    "in summary , we presented a scheme for the systematic investigation of the dependence of the symmetry of the transmission function around the energy of quantum interference induced minima on the molecular structure in single molecule junctions .",
    "for this purpose we mapped the molecular orbitals of molecular wires with side groups onto simple two - site tight binding models where it was found that the shape of the transmission function just depends on two parameters which provides a strong link to previous findings for t - stub tuners in mesoscopic waveguides .",
    "we applied the mapping procedure on a series of molecular wires which vary in their number of carbon atoms as well as the chemical nature and bonding position of side groups .",
    "we predicted from our scheme and verified with density functional theory calculations that the peak shape is mostly determined by the coupling between the side group and the molecular chain ( where a small coupling results in high asymmetry ) and the energy difference of the side group atomic orbital and the molecular orbital closest to it ( where a large difference results in high asymmetry ) .",
    "the role of the topology of this molecular orbital in producing quite different peak shapes for very similar molecules could be explained from our model and was further verified by dft transport calculations .",

    "this term is usually small and we shall not consider it here .    finally , the electronic contribution to the thermal conductance is given by  @xcite @xmath82    it is useful to rewrite @xmath11 as @xmath83 where @xmath36 is the purely electronic part which equals the total value for @xmath11 , when @xmath84 . in recent theoretical articles on thermoelectrics in molecular junctions",
    "very large values for @xmath36 have been reported for molecular junctions with quantum interference effects and tranmission nodes  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not really justified to neglect @xmath8 , especially not when the electronic transmission is very small , as is the case around transmission zeros , because in this case @xmath7 will also be very small , and the contribution from phonons may be very important .",
    "while calculations of the phonon thermal conductance in principle can be performed at a dft level of theory , the calculations are quite demanding and there are only few reports on first - principles calculations of @xmath8 for molecular junctions  @xcite .",
    "the main focus in our present work is on electronic properties and the @xmath11 values reported in the main text are thus calculated from eq . assuming a constant value of @xmath8=50 pw / k as determined experimentally for thiol - bonded alkanes  @xcite , which are quite similar to the molecules considered in our article .",
    "assuming a single - particle picture , the transmission function for electrons incident on a molecular junction with an energy @xmath26 can be defined as @xmath85(e)\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the green s function matrix of the contacted molecule , @xmath87 is the identity matrix , @xmath88 is the self - energy due to the left / right lead , and @xmath89 . in our ao - tb models",
    "the hamiltonian describing the molecule is given in terms of a basis consisting of localized atomic - like orbitals , @xmath90 , , where only two are coupled to the leads , which allows us to write the transmission function as @xmath91 the matrix element @xmath92 can be obtained using cramer s rule @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the @xmath95 co - factor of @xmath96 defined as the determinant of the matrix obtained by removing the 1st row and @xmath97th column from @xmath98 and multiplying it by @xmath99 . since we assume that only orbitals @xmath100 and @xmath101 couple to the leads , the removal of the 1st row and @xmath97th column completely removes @xmath102 in the co - factor .",
    "we imply a wide band limit , where the lead coupling strength , @xmath38 , becomes energy independent and @xmath103 .    for the two - site mo models in the main text",
    "there is only one site with an onsite energy @xmath104 connected to both leads ( @xmath105 ) and coupled to a side group ( @xmath106 ) with a hopping parameter @xmath40 .",
    "for such a system we find    @xmath107    which results in    @xmath108",
    "in order to address the explicit dependence of the side group on - site energies and coupling parameters we first write the full hamiltonian of the molecule ( in a basis of @xmath1 orbitals ) as @xmath109 where @xmath110 describes the linear carbon chain without the side group having the structure @xmath111    here @xmath112 is the carbon on - site energy and @xmath57 is the nearest neighbour hopping parameter .",
    "the last row and column correspond to the single basis function on the side group .",
    "the side group hamiltonian , @xmath113 has the form @xmath114 we now proceed by diagonalizing @xmath110 to find the molecular orbitals ( mos ) of the molecule without the side group .",
    "the @xmath115th mo has the vector form @xmath116,\\ ] ] assuming there are @xmath97 atoms in the chain , and where @xmath117 is the coefficient corresponding to the orbital weight on site @xmath118 .",
    "the last 0 is at the side group orbital where the mo by definition has no weight .",
    "we now make the approximation , to consider only a limited number of mos and neglect all the others . in the simplest case ,",
    "we consider only the homo , @xmath119 , and proceed to construct a _ model hamiltonian _ including only the homo and the side group orbital . in this case",
    "our basis consist of two orbitals : @xmath120 since @xmath121 ( the energy of the homo ) , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , we arrive at @xmath125 where the coupling parameter @xmath60 is given by @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the mo orbital weight on the site , which couples to the side group .",
    "we thus observe that the effective coupling , @xmath60 , to the side group in the model hamiltonian depends on the real coupling parameter @xmath59 _ and _ the orbital weight .",
    "this described procedure where only one mo is considered is applied for all the molecules in the main text .",
    "the transmission through the model system is calculated in the wide band limit with constant self - energies assuming that only one mo couples to both electrodes .",
    "the electrode - self energy matrices thus have the form @xmath128 and the transmission function is calculated using the standard non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) methods also employed in conjunction with density functional theory ( dft ) in the main text .",
    "the value of @xmath38 is obtained from the lead coupling @xmath19 used in the full ao - tb model as @xmath129 the reason why the orbital weight is squared is that the lead self - energy , is calculated from a surface green s function , @xmath130 as @xmath131 , where the effective coupling , @xmath132 , between the leads and the molecule can be calculated for the single homo orbital in the same way as its effective coupling to the side group shown above . in all our calculations",
    "there are no differences between left and right coupling since all the considered orbitals have the same squared weight on both terminal sites of the chain .",
    "we calculate the side group on - site energy from the full hamiltonian matrix , @xmath133 , describing the molecule and the au electrodes .",
    "we project onto the subspace spanned by the basis functions of the side groups @xmath134 where @xmath135 has diagonal elements on the indices of the side group basis functions , and zeros elsewhere and similarly obtain also a side group overlap matrix , @xmath136 .",
    "we then diagonalize @xmath137 to find the side group energies and eigenstates , where for each side group eigenstate @xmath138 , we calculate a coupling matrix element to the closest @xmath1 orbital ( assumed to be on atom @xmath139 ) in the main chain as @xmath140 with @xmath141 a vector which is one on the index corresponding to the @xmath1 basis orbital on atom @xmath139 and zero in all other coordinates .",
    "only the side group eigenstates with @xmath0 symmetry will result in a large coupling @xmath142 .",
    "we therefore include only the @xmath0 state which is closest to the fermi level in our 2 site mo model and take its energy for the parameter @xmath58 ."
