    "<S> the taylor - couette flow of a dilute micellar system known to generate shear - induced structures is investigated through simultaneous rheometry and ultrasonic imaging . </S>",

    "<S> the dilute regime of rodlike micelles has been studied in the context of highly elastic shear - induced structures ( sis ) and associated shear - thickening , whereas the so - called `` semi - dilute '' and `` concentrated '' regimes have been studied in the context of shear - banding , which is an extreme form of shear - thinning where the velocity gradient field becomes inhomogeneous even in simple shear  @xcite .    on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> shear - banding micellar systems have a high viscosity , such that inertial flow instabilities can generally be neglected . </S>",

    "<S> this microscopic scenario was confirmed through neutron and light scattering experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shear - induced state can then be shear - thinning due to the increasing alignment of the worms .    in the present experiments the fluid </S>",
    "<S> is sheared in a taylor - couette ( tc ) device adapted to a rheometer ( arg2 , ta instruments ) and with dimensions ( height @xmath12  mm , gap @xmath13  mm , radius of the inner rotating cylinder @xmath14  mm ) that ensure the `` small gap approximation '' , @xmath15 , without any strong end effect at the top and bottom boundaries ( @xmath16 ) , so that the laminar base flow is a simple shear with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the rotor linear and angular velocities respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that in a tc device with inner rotation , taylor showed that a newtonian fluid becomes unstable and develops a secondary flow made of toroidal counter - rotating vortices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> larson , shaqfeh and muller discovered that non - newtonian fluids can develop a similar vortex flow not driven by inertia , but driven by elasticity  @xcite . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the instability develops when the taylor number @xmath20 exceeds a given threshold @xmath21 . in the purely inertial case @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite , while in the purely elastic case @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a characteristic polymeric relaxation time  @xcite instead of the viscous dissipation time @xmath28 , and @xmath29  kg.m@xmath30 is the fluid density . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , the value of @xmath21 depends on the constitutive relation of the non - newtonian fluid , e.g. , linear stability theory predicts @xmath31 for the upper - convected maxwell model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally the balance between elasticity and inertia can be estimated by the elasticity number @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> although predicting the onset of instability for arbitrary elasticity is not yet possible , a range of inertio - elastic instabilities is expected but remains mostly unexplored  @xcite .    since we expect secondary flows to emerge , our geometry is equipped with a recently developed two - dimensional ultrasonic velocimetry technique that allows the simultaneous measurement of 128 velocity profiles over 30  mm along the vertical direction in the tc geometry  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> this technique yields the component @xmath34 of the velocity vector , @xmath35 in cylindrical coordinates , projected along the acoustic propagation axis @xmath36 as a function of the radial distance @xmath37 to the rotor and of the vertical position @xmath38 with a temporal resolution down to 50  @xmath33s  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the acoustic axis @xmath36 is horizontal and makes an angle @xmath39 with the normal to the outer cylinder so that @xmath40 . </S>",

    "<S> more generally @xmath44 combines contributions from both azimuthal and radial velocity components . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , close to instability onset , secondary flows are usually much weaker than the main flow , such that @xmath45 , as checked recently on an inertially unstable newtonian fluid and on an elastically unstable shear - banding fluid  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> , a laminar boundary layer extends from the inner cylinder to the outer cylinder . a taylor vortex flow ( tvf ) then develops for @xmath57  s , deforming the main flow which becomes periodic along @xmath38 : slow moving fluid is brought inward in regions of centripetal radial flow and fast moving fluid is pushed outward in regions of centrifugal radial flow . </S>",
    "<S> this initial sequence of events would be exactly similar if the fluid was pure water  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though such a tvf had never been reported before for dilute micelles , it should not be surprising since , assuming the fluid to be influenced only by inertia in this initial sequence , we have @xmath58 for @xmath46  s@xmath7 . in computing @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> , we have used the dynamic viscosity relevant to the short - time behavior , i.e. the zero - shear viscosity @xmath59  mpa.s . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) the onset of tvf at @xmath60  s corresponds to a slight increase of the shear stress @xmath61 ( after an initial spike due to the feedback with the rheometer inertia ) . </S>",
    "<S> this first stress increase is simply due to the formation of vortices breaking the viscometric assumption  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for @xmath62  s , the stress ( or alternatively the viscosity ) climbs up much more dramatically . since @xmath46  s@xmath7 falls into the shear - thickening range for @xmath56c ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , this next sequence of events can clearly be attributed to slow sis formation . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](b , left ) are lost and the flow becomes chaotic - like in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b , right ) . </S>",
    "<S> this latter state is reminiscent of the inertio - elastic turbulent state called `` disordered oscillations ''  @xcite or `` elastically dominated turbulence ''  @xcite . while iso - velocity lines in the initial state can be approximated by harmonic functions , the new secondary flows associated with the sis deform the main flow intermittently . </S>",
    "<S> the state in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b , right ) is representative of the asymptotic turbulent flow . </S>",
    "<S> it continuously generates large fluctuations in the viscosity and stress , which have been reported before but never accounted for in terms of elastic turbulence  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the turbulent nature of the flow can locally and transiently generate plug flow profiles that may explain some earlier 1d velocity measurements  @xcite . at lower shear rates , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. @xmath63  s@xmath64 and @xmath65 , the flow is below both thresholds for tvf and sis formation and remains purely azimuthal as shown in supp . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> as it turned out for @xmath56c , the critical shear rate @xmath11 for sis formation and the critical shear rate @xmath66 for the onset of tvf are about the same value @xmath67  s@xmath7 in our tc geometry ( @xmath68 ) . in order to separate the inertial tvf and the turbulence associated with sis more readily , we reproduced similar shear start - up protocols at two other temperatures , @xmath3 and @xmath69c , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the temperature slightly lowers the zero - shear viscosity ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) so that @xmath70 only decreases from 45  s@xmath7 at @xmath71c to 33  s@xmath7 at @xmath69c . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the same temperature change has a much stronger impact on @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> as reported extensively in the literature  @xcite , lowering the temperature leads to easier sis formation hence shifting @xmath11 to lower values . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ] indicates @xmath6 and 80  s@xmath7 at @xmath71c and @xmath69c respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore at the highest temperature , we should be able to observe tvf without sis , whereas sis without tvf may be expected at the lowest temperature . </S>",

    "<S> ( d ) ] . [ fig3],width=257 ]    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that sis and tvf can occur separately is an indication that these two phenomena are not consequences of one another . </S>",
    "<S> sis do not need tvf to nucleate , which suggests that the out - of - equilibrium growth of the worms is driven by the base shear flow , as usually postulated  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> early velocity measurements at a single height @xmath38 reported that sis first form at the inner wall and generate significant slip on this wall  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless slip velocities @xmath83 @xcite shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) and [ fig3](c ) confirm that the onset of wall slip is concomitant with sis formation , whereas no noticeable wall slip is reported in the presence of tvf alone [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> of course tvf does not need sis since it can occur even in simple molecular fluids . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the spatiotemporal structure of the flow in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b , right ) and [ fig3](d , right ) are very similar so that tvf appears to have negligible impact on the asymptotic turbulent flow after sis nucleation . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that before the nucleation of sis inertia is dominating the instability of the flow , whereas once sis are formed elasticity dominates . in a shear - thickening dilute surfactant solution , </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath28 and @xmath27 depend on @xmath2 and @xmath84 so that @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath85 also depend on @xmath2 and @xmath84 . to illustrate this </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate a bulk - averaged value of @xmath85 in the case of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( @xmath56c and @xmath46  s@xmath7 ) . assuming the fluid density @xmath86 to remain constant during sis formation </S>",
    "<S> , we first estimate the reynolds number by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the `` true '' shear rate corrected for wall slip and @xmath89 the corresponding `` true '' viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a decrease from @xmath90 before sis formation to @xmath91 in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> estimating the characteristic viscoelastic time @xmath27 of the sis is more challenging . </S>",
    "<S> we take the longest time of the stress relaxation after flow cessation either before or after sis formation , which yields @xmath92 before and @xmath93 after sis formation in accordance with the literature  @xcite . thus in the early stages of the dynamics </S>",
