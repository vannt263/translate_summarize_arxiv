    "among possible interacting superconformal field theories ( scfts ) in diverse dimensions , the six - dimensional ( 6d ) theories are less well understood .",
    "it is expected that 6d @xmath6 scfts involve tensionless strings and show very non - trivial physics .",
    "this non - trivial nature of the 6d scfts is deeply related to the strong coupling physics of superstring theory , but its detailed features have yet to be discovered .",
    "the e - string theory is a typical 6d @xmath6 scft .",
    "originally , the e - string theory was found in the heterotic strings for the small @xmath7 instanton @xcite .",
    "there are also several other realizations of the theory .",
    "for instance , by considering m5-brane probing the end of the world m9 boundary @xcite , we can find the e - string theory on the m5 world - volume .",
    "m - theory or a topological string , on the local @xmath0k3 surface , which describes a calabi ",
    "yau 3-fold in the vicinity of the @xmath0k3 4-cycle , is dual to the e - string theory @xcite . shrinking a @xmath0k3 4-cycle in calabi ",
    "yau compactification of f - theory also leads to the e - string theory @xcite .",
    "the seiberg  witten curve , the prepotential , and the partition function of the e - string theory have been studied in @xcite . moreover , quite recently there was an attempt at classifying all 6d @xmath6 scfts @xcite .",
    "the anomaly polynomials of these 6d theories were also determined in @xcite .",
    "recently there has been significant progress on the localization computation in 5d gauge theories . in @xcite ,",
    "the localization calculation was formulated for the superconformal index of 5d @xmath8 @xmath9 gauge theories with @xmath10 flavors , and it was found that this index shows the enhancement of global symmetry @xmath11 as was expected from seiberg s argument @xcite .",
    "the same index was also derived from the topological string theory in @xcite , and the enhancement was studied in more detail in @xcite from the perspective of topological strings on local calabi  yau 3-folds . in @xcite , it was found that nekrasov partition functions also show the enhancement .",
    "these developments led to exact computation on the partition function and superconformal index of a 5d theory starting directly from the ir lagrangian or from the corresponding brane web configuration / calabi  yau geometry .",
    "this technology is the main ingredient of our approach to the e - string theory .",
    "thanks to the developments in localization , quantitative study on 6d @xmath6 scfts is getting more manageable . in @xcite , based on the elliptic genus computation , the e - string partition function up to four e - strings was computed .",
    "see also @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different description of the e - string theory based on the familiar type iib 5-brane setup . in the case of 5d @xmath8 gauge theories ,",
    "the world - volume theory of the corresponding @xmath12 5-brane web configuration leads to the desired gauge theory @xcite .",

    "if these techniques are also applicable to the 6d e - string theory , they will be a very powerful method conceptually and computationally to investigate 6d dynamics .",
    "to this end , we utilize the key fact : the e - string theory of interest , which is a 6d @xmath6 scft , appears as the uv fixed point of _ 5d _ @xmath8 @xmath13 gauge theory with eight flavors .",
    "indeed , the agreement of the corresponding partition functions is checked in @xcite .",
    "this means that once one finds a 5-brane web for @xmath13 gauge theory with eight flavors , one can apply all the established techniques to study the e - strings . in this paper",
    ", we discuss such @xmath12 5-brane web description of the e - string theory .",

    ", we can write down a combinatorial expression of the full - order partition function , which is the generating function of the elliptic genera of the e - strings .",
    "this generating function is precisely the full partition function of topological strings on the local @xmath0k3 surface .",

    "when we try to pull out the 7-branes , we find that the @xmath47 $ ] 7-branes change their charges due to the monodromy cut created by @xmath48 $ ] 7-branes and @xmath27 $ ] 7-branes , which makes the attached 5-branes form spiral arms . after taking all 7-branes to infinity",
    ", we find a spiral web diagram with multiple arms which rotate infinitely many times , as in figure [ fig : test](a ) .",
    "we will call such a spiral diagram `` tao diagram '' for short because its spiral structure is close to a symbolic representation of the taoism philosophy figure [ fig : test](b ) .",
    "this tao diagram is an intuitive one that reveals the spiral nature of the @xmath12 5-brane web diagram for @xmath42 flavors .",
    "note that figure [ fig : test](a ) contains multiple coincident 5-branes intersecting at one vertex .",
    "these 5-branes actually jump over the other 5-brane at such a vertex in the sense of @xcite .",

    ". we will show definite way to treat it in the next section .",
    "unfortunately , the above tao web figure [ fig : test](a ) involves strange `` @xmath49 5-branes '' which can not be any bound state .",
    "to avoid discussion of the proper treatment of such 5-branes , we switch to a more healthy web description in the following .",
    "in fact , a web description for a given 7-brane background is not unique because changing the ordering of 7-brane movement results in a different web @xcite . in the next subsection",
    ", we demonstrate in detail that there exists another tao web for the e - string theory , and we will use this new tao diagram throughout this paper .",
    "as we have observed in the previous subsection , @xmath42 theory leads to spiral 5-brane configuration and opens up a new dimension associated with the cyclic nature .",
    "such a tao web would give an intuitive and effective description of the 6d e - string theory .",
    "in this subsection , we give a simpler and more useful tao diagram which describes the e - string theory .",
    "the starting point is the affine 7-brane background again , @xmath51 we will consider the 5-brane loop configuration on this configuration to construct a dual description of the local @xmath0k3 surface as was done in the cases of the local del pezzo surface @xcite .",
    "the resulting tao web is therefore a generalized toric description of the local @xmath0k3 surface .    as is explained in appendix [ app : convention ] , reordering these 7-branes leads to another expression of the @xmath52 configuration : @xmath53        this configuration probed by a 5-brane loop is the left - hand side of figure [ fig:7branee9 ] .",
    "the solid black line is the 5-brane loop probing 7-branes , and all the branch - cuts illustrated with the gray dashed lines are outgoing . pulling out the 7-branes from the 5-brane loop together with the flop transitions",
    "leads to the right - hand side of figure [ fig:7branee9 ] . the hanany ",
    "witten effect introduces new 5-brane prongs attached to the 7-branes .",
    "we can continue to move the 7-branes away from the middle 5-brane loop ; however , a 7-brane soon hits a branch - cut coming from another 7-brane .",
    "the shape of the resulting web configuration therefore depends on the ordering of the 7-brane motion .",
    "let us consider the 7-brane motion illustrated in figure [ fig:7branemove ] .",
    "continuing to move 7-branes with such an ordering , we finally find the spirally growing 5-brane web in figure [ fig : taoweb ] .",
    "this is precisely the tao brane web which describes @xmath13 gauge theory with @xmath42 flavors , that is , the e - string theory .",
    "this tao web in figure [ fig : taoweb ] has six external legs making spiral cycles , and each leg has period 6 of its joints .",
    "in addition , there are six straightly outgoing legs which consist of bundles of 5-branes of the same @xmath12 type .",
    "a bundle increases the number of constituent 5-branes by one each time the bundle crosses a spiral leg .",
    "this structure comes from the hanany ",
    "witten effect that occurs when one moves all remnants of 7-branes to infinity after creating the six spiral legs in figure [ fig:7branemove ] .",
    "this local structure is a degenerate version of the @xmath54 5-brane web . from this point of view",
    ", we can construct the tao web by gluing together six @xmath55 sub - webs .",
    "treatment of such a degenerate toric diagram was studied in @xcite .",
    "we will explain it in the next section .",
    "it is claimed in @xcite that 5d @xmath57 gauge theory with @xmath10 flavors has 5d uv fixed point only for @xmath58 and that it does not for @xmath59 .",
    "the e - string case @xmath42 is critical , where it has 6d uv fixed point .",
    "however , it looks as if we can consider @xmath59 configuration at least formally starting from the 7-brane background ( [ affine7branebkgd ] ) . does our brane web system `` know '' that @xmath42 is critical ?",
    "the @xmath60 cases lead to finite web diagrams associated with the local del pezzo surfaces ; the @xmath42 configuration opens up a new @xmath61 direction , and it gives the tao diagram associated with the local @xmath0k3 surface .",
    "then , what will happen for @xmath59 ?",
    "a way to see that the @xmath42 case is critical is that if one successively applies 7-brane monodromy to move a @xmath19 $ ] 7-brane through other 7-branes , then it comes back to the original configuration after one rotation , which is a necessary condition for the spiral shape of the 5-brane web .",
    "for instance , the 7-brane configuration corresponding to the middle diagram in figure [ fig : howtomaketao ] is given by @xmath62}{\\bf n}{\\bf a}^4{\\bf x}_{[2,1]}{\\bf n}{\\bf a}^4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and two @xmath47 $ ] 7-branes ( green dots in the diagram ) are rotating clockwise .",
    "this means that these two 7-branes undergo the following monodromies due to the branch cuts from the remaining 7-branes : @xmath63 hence the charges of the rotating 7-branes changes as it passes through each cut . for one rotation ,",
    "the monodromy matrix that two @xmath47 $ ] 7-branes go through is @xmath64}^{-4 } k_{[0,1]}^{-1 } k_{[1,0]}^{-4 } k_{[0,1]}^{-1 } = \\begin{pmatrix } 5~&~-8\\cr 2~&~-3 \\end{pmatrix},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields @xmath65 hence , the charge of two @xmath47 $ ] 7-branes remain the same after one rotation .",
    "one can apply the same logic to @xmath66 flavors .",
    "a configuration for @xmath66 that one can find is one which adds one more flavor @xmath48 $ ] 7-branes to figure [ fig : howtomaketao ] : @xmath67}{\\bf n}{\\bf a}^5{\\bf x}_{[3,1]}{\\bf n}{\\bf a}^4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we take the @xmath68 $ ] 7-brane and let it go clockwise through all the branch cuts then it is easy to see that the charge changes due to monodromy can never be same as any of the 7-branes above . in a similar way ,",
    "the charge of a @xmath68 $ ] 7-brane becomes @xmath69 $ ] after one rotation , given by @xmath70}^{-5 } k_{[0,1]}^{-1 } k_{[1,0]}^{-4 } k_{[0,1]}^{-1 } \\cdot [ 3,1 ] = [ 10,3].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the direction that the resultant charge points is inward rather than outward .",
    "the more it goes around , the more it points inward .",
    "the 5-brane attached to this inwardly rotating 7-brane eventually crosses into the 5-brane loop in the middle , and thus it shrinks to the origin rather than going away from the origin . in other words the configuration with @xmath66 flavors never makes a proper 5-brane web , it all collapses . in a similar fashion",
    ", one finds collapsing of brane configuration for higher flavors @xmath71 .",
    "this is consistent with the known result and it is a geometric account of why @xmath42 configuration is critical .",
    "in this section , we go back to the tao diagram , which corresponds to @xmath42 . it is discussed in @xcite that a @xmath12 5-brane web can be reinterpreted as a toric diagram .",
    "there are various reports @xcite that this claim also works for the `` toric - like diagram '' introduced in @xcite , which contains 5-branes jumping over other 5-branes .",
    "therefore , we expect that it is also the case for our tao diagram even if it extends to infinity .",
    "in other words , we expect that our tao diagram gives a toric - like description for local @xmath0k3 . assuming this",
    ", we compute the e - string partition function using the topological vertex in the next section . as a preparation",
    ", we need to study the relations among the khler parameters of the corresponding geometry as well as their relation with the gauge theory parameters .    for each segment @xmath72 in the web diagram , we associate the length parameter @xmath73 and exponentiated one @xmath74 . in the language of toric - like geometry , this parameter is the khler parameter of the two - cycle corresponding to the segment . unlike a usual web diagram ,",
    "there are infinitely many segments and their khler parameters in our diagram .",
    "they are , however , highly constrained since the six radial legs trigger the turns of the spirals .",
    "we can solve such constraint equations and finally find only ten free parameters .",
    "we introduce a notation for organizing infinitely many khler parameters . in the tao web",
    "there are six spiral external legs , and we label them by integers @xmath75 in counterclockwise order . an infinite number of straight - line segments compose a spiral leg .",
    "to describe this spiral curve , we label khler parameters @xmath76 , with @xmath77 being the turn number of the @xmath78th arm .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the `` distance '' @xmath79 between adjacent arms , @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we define @xmath83        so that is also satisfied for @xmath84 and/or @xmath85 .",
    "this parametrization is depicted in figure [ fig : notation ] . by iteration",
    ", one finds that any khler parameter can be expressed as @xmath86 by introducing the `` period '' @xmath87 @xmath88 one also finds that the @xmath78th arms are aligned parallel every six turns : @xmath89 we thus have 12 parameters : @xmath79 and @xmath90 .",
    "we note , however , that they depend only on nine out of ten physical parameters , eight flavors , and one gauge coupling . , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , which parametrize the structure of the middle part of the diagram , as well as @xmath76 , which are associated with the spiral legs , as depicted in figure [ fig : notation ] .",
    "they depend on the ten physical parameters in total : eight mass parameters , one gauge coupling constant , and one coulomb moduli parameter .",
    "however , it turns out that @xmath76 do not depend on the coulomb moduli parameter and thus depend only on nine parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the remaining khler moduli parameters @xmath93 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 do depend on the coulomb moduli parameter as we will explain later .",
    "] hence , the 12 parameters are not all independent , but are subject to the following three constraints : + ( i ) vertical constraint ( @xmath94 ) : @xmath95 ( ii ) horizontal constraint ( @xmath96 ) : @xmath97 ( iii ) constraint on the origin of the coulomb branch : @xmath98 the last constraint requires some explanation . if we perform local deformation to make the vanishing coulomb moduli ( see the right - hand side of figure [ fig : notation ] ) , then the origin of the coulomb branch is supposed to be the starting point of the khler parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 . by taking the horizontal projection associated with @xmath99 , one finds that @xmath101 likewise , one obtains @xmath102 from the vertical projection , it is easy to see that @xmath103    it follows from , , and that one finds . therefore , the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath90 , constrained by ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) , can be a set of building blocks describing all the khler parameters for the tao spiral .",
    "since only ten parameters are independent in the tao web , all the khler parameters can be written in terms of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath91 in figure [ fig : notation ] .",
    "these bases are usually used for constructing a nekrasov partition function in the context of a topological string . for considering the flavor symmetry of the topological string partition function ,",
    "more useful parametrization is given by the @xmath104 fugacities corresponding to the masses @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , the instanton factor @xmath107 and the coulomb moduli @xmath108 introduced through the relations : @xmath109 the first and the second relations of are straightforward to understand if we carefully follow the sequence of the hanany ",
    "witten transition from figure [ fig : howtomaketao ] to figure [ fig:7branemove ] and study which parameter in one diagram corresponds to which parameter in the other diagram .",
    "we will see that @xmath92 corresponds to the distance between one of the color d5 branes and one of the flavor d5-branes , while @xmath93 corresponds to the distance between the two color d5-branes in figure [ fig : howtomaketao ] .",
    "we need further explanation for the third relation .",
    "it is natural that the horizontal distance @xmath91 is proportional to the instanton factor @xmath107 since the distance between two ns5-branes corresponds to the gauge coupling constant . on top of that",
    ", the prefactor in front of the right - hand side of @xmath91 appears as follows : when we compute the topological string partition function , the factor in the form @xmath110 typically appears , where @xmath111 is a certain product of the khler parameters .",
    "when we rewrite this factor in the form of @xmath112 , we obtain the prefactor @xmath113 . in order for the topological string amplitude to agree with the nekrasov partition function ,",
    "we need to absorb the collection of such factors into @xmath91 and regard it as the instanton factor @xmath107 . for @xmath114",
    ", it is explicitly checked that such a factor flavors . ]",
    "is given by ( the inverse of ) @xmath115 .",
    "we assumed that it is also the case for @xmath42 .    from figure",
    "[ fig : notation ] , one finds that @xmath79 are expressed in terms of @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , @xmath118 this leads to the period being the instanton factor squared : @xmath119 in a similar fashion , all the @xmath90 are expressed in terms of @xmath120 and @xmath107 , and so are all khler parameters .",
    "the results for the other parameters are summarized in appendix [ app : kahler ] . since it is known that the instanton factor of the 5d @xmath57 gauge theory with @xmath42 flavor is identified as the modulus of the compactified torus of the e - string , we find that the period of our tao diagram is also given by this modulus .",
    "this is consistent with the intuition that the spiral structure will correspond to the kk mode of the e - string and , thus , the cyclic structure of the spiral in our tao diagram is a key to the uplift to 6d . in the next section ,",
    "we compute the partition function and give quantitative support for this claim .    here , we briefly comment on the subtle difference between the parameters used in the nekrasov partition function for the 5d @xmath57 gauge theory with eight flavors and those used in the e - string partition function , which is clarified in @xcite .",
    "our parameters @xmath121 , @xmath107 , and @xmath122 are those for the 5d nekrasov partition function .",
    "if we would like to obtain the e - string partition function in an @xmath123 manifest form , we need to use other parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 defined as @xmath126 while the other parameters are identical . since our formula for the partition function",
    "will be given in a closed form and in a way that does not depend on the detail of the parametrization of the khler parameters , it should be possible to interpret it either as the 5d nekrasov partition function or as the e - string partition function depending on which parametrization we use .",
    "however , when we compare our formula with the known result @xcite , we use the parameters for the 5d nekrasov partition function .",
    "in the previous section , we found a new web description of the 6d e - string theory . in this section ,",
    "we compute the e - string partition function by applying the topological vertex computation to our web .",
    "we will see that our partition function precisely agrees with the partition function computed by a completely different method @xcite . for simplicity , we concentrate on the self - dual @xmath127-background @xmath128 in this paper .          in this section ,",
    "we compute the topological string partition function of the tao web figure [ fig : taoweb ] .",
    "this tao web contains a number of 5-branes jumping other 5-branes as we discussed in the previous section . on the left - hand side of figure [ fig;deg ] ,",
    "such a configuration is illustrated .",
    "this jumping is realized by degenerating the corresponding khler parameters as in the middle diagram in the topological vertex formalism , and these jumping 5-branes are decoupled from the nontrivial trivalent vertex as in the right hand of figure [ fig;deg ] .",
    "we therefore need to take only this nontrivial vertex into account in the topological vertex computation .        in the topological vertex computation of nekrasov partition functions ,",
