    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) is the first solar neutrino detector capable of measuring the flux of electron - type solar neutrinos above 5  mev as well as the total flux of all active solar neutrinos above 2.2 mev . in order to reduce cosmic - ray backgrounds ,",
    "sno is located 2092 m underground in the creighton nickel mine owned by cvrd inco , ltd .",
    "near sudbury , ontario , canada .",
    "the central volume of sno is 1000 metric tonnes of ultrapure heavy water ( d@xmath2o ) contained in an acrylic vessel ( av ) .",
    "strict controls of radioactive impurities were applied to all materials used in the sno detector , to minimize backgrounds and allow extraction of the neutrino signal of approximately ten events per day .",
    "neutrinos are detected in sno through the reactions :    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    where @xmath7 refers to any active flavor of neutrino .",
    "sno can detect the first two interactions when an electron produces cherenkov light that reaches the photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) array surrounding the d@xmath2o . the elastic scattering ( es ) of electrons by neutrinos ( eq .",
    "1 ) is sensitive mostly to electron - type neutrinos .",
    "these events are highly directional , establishing the solar origin of the neutrinos . the charged - current ( cc ) absorption of an electron - type neutrino by the deuteron ( eq .",
    "2 ) produces an electron with an energy related to that of the incident neutrino , allowing sno to measure the energy spectrum of these neutrinos above an analysis threshold of @xmath8  mev .",
    "the neutral - current ( nc ) disintegration of a deuteron by a neutrino of any active flavor produces a neutron and a proton ( eq .",
    "3 ) and has an energy threshold of 2.2 mev .",
    "sno was designed to detect the neutron liberated from this reaction in three different ways , each in its own phase of the experiment .",
    "a complete description of the sno detector has been published previously @xcite .    in the first phase of sno , the d@xmath2o phase , the thermalized neutron was absorbed by a deuteron with a 0.5-mb cross - section @xcite , releasing a 6.25-mev photon .",
    "the photon compton scattered , imparting enough energy to the electrons to create cherenkov light that was detected in the pmt array .",
    "the cherenkov light from these neutron captures was statistically separated from the cc and es cherenkov signals using distributions of the reconstructed energy , position , and direction of the events .",
    "this phase of sno ran from november 2 , 1999 to may 31 , 2001 , and results have been published @xcite .",
    "for the second phase , the salt phase , two tonnes of purified nacl were added to the d@xmath2o .",
    "this additive enhanced the probability of neutron capture within the central volume because the 44-b thermal capture cross - section on @xmath9cl is more than 80,000 times larger than the cross - section on deuterium @xcite .",
    "absorption of a neutron on @xmath9cl produces an 8.6-mev cascade of photons that compton scatter , yielding cherenkov light that was detected with the pmt array .",
    "compared to the d@xmath2o phase , the larger isotropy of the light from this cascade allowed for a more accurate separation of the nc events from those produced by other neutrino reactions .",
    "a complete analysis of results from this phase has been performed @xcite and encompasses data from july 26 , 2001 to august 28 , 2003 .",
    "the third and final phase , the ncd phase , utilized an array of proportional counters filled with a @xmath0he - cf@xmath1 gas mixture for neutron detection independent of the pmts .",
    "these neutral - current detectors ( ncds ) capture the neutron released in eq .",
    "3 , thereby measuring the rate of this reaction . though more technically complicated than the d@xmath2o or salt methods , the use of ncds has many advantages .",
    "the ncds were distributed in the d@xmath2o volume , and only blocked 9% of the cherenkov light . over 60% of the detected nc events",
    "were recorded separately from the cc and es signals and can be distinguished on an event - by - event basis .",
    "thus the nc flux can be measured without performing the statistical separation that was necessary in the previous phases of sno , reducing the correlation between the nc and cc measurements from about @xmath10 to better than @xmath11 .",
    "this phase is expected to produce a result for the nc flux of comparable precision to previous phases of sno , but with very different systematics .",
    "additionally , the cc signal in the ncd phase has substantially reduced contamination from neutron capture .",
    "the ncd phase provides an opportunity to confirm the previous results from sno in an ` independent ' detector .",
    "installation of the ncd array in the sno detector began in november 2003 after the nacl was removed , and was completed in april 2004 . after a period of commissioning , data - taking with the complete detector system began on november 27 , 2004 and concluded on november 28 , 2006 .",
    "this article discusses the design and construction of the ncds and their deployment into the sno detector .",
    "the ncd electronics and data acquisition system are also described , as well as the signals and backgrounds in the ncds and results from radiopurity measurements of the ncd array .",
    "standard solar models ( ssm ) @xcite predict that approximately 13 neutrons are produced per day by nc interactions within sno s heavy water .",
    "it is essential that care be taken to minimize backgrounds if such small rates are to be reliably measured .",
    "proportional counters are well - suited for extremely low - background applications since the gaseous active medium can be readily purified .",
    "the background level of proportional counters is set by cosmogenics , radioactivity in construction materials , and spurious pulses originating from sources other than ionizing radiation .    since d@xmath2o is an excellent moderator with low absorption of thermal neutrons , it is possible to detect free neutrons by placing a sparse array of proportional counters filled with a neutron - absorbing gas in the heavy water .",
    "it was decided to fill the proportional counters with @xmath0he , since its use for neutron detection is well - established @xcite and takes advantage of its large neutron - capture cross section of 5333 b @xcite .",
    "neutron detection in a @xmath0he proportional counter occurs via the reaction : @xmath12 which produces a back - to - back proton - triton pair , with the proton carrying 573 kev of kinetic energy and the triton having 191 kev .",
    "these energetic ions create over 20,000 electron - ion pairs .",
    "the electrons then drift towards a central anode wire , where they undergo avalanche multiplication resulting in a large number of secondary electron - ion pairs that produce an electrical signal on the anode .    despite the discrete energy , the neutron spectrum of a @xmath0he proportional counter",
    "is not simply a sharp peak at 764  kev .",
    "when a neutron capture occurs near the wall of the proportional counter , the proton or triton may strike the wall before stopping in the gas , causing events that leave less than 764  kev in the gas .",
    "an energy deposition of 191  kev corresponds to total absorption of the proton s energy in the wall @xcite .",
    "energy depositions below 191 kev are extremely rare ( less than 0.1% of the events ) , due to the limited geometric phase space for both particles to strike the wall .",
    "figure [ spect ] shows a neutron - capture energy spectrum from the ncd array , illustrating this ` wall effect ' , which can be decreased by adding another component to the gas that contributes stopping power .",
    "cf@xmath1 was used in the ncds for this purpose , and to provide quenching .",
    "na calibration .",
    "the peak at 764 kev corresponds to deposition of the full kinetic energy of the proton and triton in the active volume of the ncd .",
    "the 573-kev shoulder , caused by total absorption of the triton s energy in the wall , is distorted by space - charge effects , discussed in section  [ signals ] .",
    "the 191-kev shoulder is caused by total absorption of the proton s energy in the wall . ]",
    "there are several potential sources of background events that may occur in the 191 to 764 kev energy region .",
    "nuclei that are embedded in the ncd walls and on the inner surface emit alpha particles that produce ionizing events with a broad spectrum of energies , including the neutron - capture energy region of interest .",
    "compton electrons , photoelectrons , and electrons from beta decays are a less serious problem because extensive multiple scattering is usually required before such processes can deposit enough energy in the gas to mimic a neutron event .",
    "however , tritium contamination in the @xmath0he must be kept to low levels ( on the order of nci / stp - l ) by purification to avoid pile - up of betas from tritium decay .",
    "if tritium is controlled , then the chief source of background to the neutron - capture signal in @xmath0he proportional counters is the natural alpha emitters .    in the case of sno",
    ", neutrons produced by any process other than the nc interaction of neutrinos with deuterium constitute an additional background .",
    "gamma rays above the 2.2-mev breakup threshold of the deuteron can induce photodisintegration that liberates a free neutron .",
    "both thorium and uranium must be controlled because of the high - energy gammas emitted near the bottom of both decay chains ( 2.614 mev from @xmath13tl and several gammas above 2.2 mev from @xmath14bi , with the most probable being 2.448 mev ) . because the branching fraction to the high - energy gamma is approximately 36% in the @xmath15th chain , but only about 2% in the @xmath16u chain",
    ", more stringent limits must be placed on the amount of @xmath15th .",
    "a contamination of 3.8 @xmath17 g of @xmath16u or 0.5 @xmath17 g of @xmath15th in the ncd array corresponds to 1% of the nc neutron production rate .",
    "the combined limit applied in the design of the ncd array was 2% .",
    "commercial proportional counters could not be used , since they did not meet these stringent radioactivity limits . to reach the required cleanliness ,",
    "the ncds were designed and built by the sno collaboration using low - radioactivity materials .     and described in section [ endcapsection ] ) . ]",
    "the ncds met other physical constraints .",
    "the array needed to be large enough to detect a significant number of the neutral - current disintegrations without blocking a substantial amount of light to the pmt array surrounding the d@xmath2o .",
    "the ncds also had to survive in ultrapure water at absolute pressures up to 3.2 atmospheres ( atm ) and at @xmath18c for several years .",
    "furthermore , the ncds could not exceed the 370-cm maximum length set by the size of the mine hoist cage used to bring material to the sno site . in order to deploy vertical detectors with lengths between 9 and 11 m , smaller individual ncds with lengths of between 200 and 300 cm",
    "were constructed , which were then joined together to form detector ` strings ' with electrical connections and water - tight seals .",
    "a schematic of a single ncd string is shown in figure [ ncd ] .",
    "a total of 36 ncd strings filled with @xmath0he - cf@xmath1 were deployed in the sno detector , along with four ncd strings filled with @xmath3he - cf@xmath1 to study non - neutron backgrounds .",
    "figure [ array ] shows the location and names of the forty ncd strings in the 12-m diameter sno av . each string was anchored with an acrylic anchor ball to an acrylic socket on the bottom of the av on a square lattice with a nominal 1-m spacing .",
    "the buoyancy of the ncds and cables made the arrangement of the array vertical to better than 1@xmath19 , which has been confirmed with studies of the ncd shadows in the pmts .",
    "the outer circle is the av equator and the inner circle is the neck of the av through which the ncds were deployed .",
    "the ncd string markers are not drawn to scale . ]",
    "the bodies of the ncd proportional counters were made of nickel that was purified and formed into 5.08-cm - diameter , 2-meter - long tubes by means of a chemical - vapor - deposition process .",
    "after the nickel tubes were received from the manufacturer , they were cut to length , weighed , leak - tested , straightened , flared at one end , electropolished , acid etched , rinsed in alcohol , and baked under high vacuum overnight .",
    "the tubes were then assembled into 2- to 3-meter - long proportional counters by laser - welding sections together , adding electrical feedthroughs and endcaps at either end , stringing the anode wire , and filling them with the purified gas mixture .",
    "the majority of this ncd construction work was performed in a class-100 clean room at the university of washington in seattle .",
    "small parts were prepared in a clean room at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "clean - room fabrication was essential because low particulate levels inside the finished ncds reduce both radioactivity and the generation of spurious pulses .",
    "three or four ncds were connected together with electrical couplers to form a detector string with a single readout cable .",
    "one end of each ncd is slightly flared so it can slip over the straight end of another ncd , allowing structural attachment and welding of the ncds into strings .",
    "a cable assembly at the top and a delay line at the bottom complete each string .",
    "the welding of ncds , cables , and delay lines into complete strings occurred before and during deployment of the ncd array into the sno detector .",
    "physical parameters of the ncds are shown in table [ mechanical ] .",
    "the diameter of the ncd tubes was minimized to reduce the obstruction of cherenkov light in the pmt array , while still providing good neutron - capture efficiency . a smaller ncd diameter increases the wall effect , although gas pressure and composition are also important factors in controlling this effect .",
    "the minimum thickness of the nickel walls was driven by the requirement that the tubes not collapse when evacuated prior to gas fill , which , by choice of gas pressure , provided a more rigorous constraint than the pressure differential when the ncds are submerged in sno s heavy water .",
    "details of the ncd design and materials selection are given in the following sections .",
    "additional information about the ncd design has been published in several dissertations and theses @xcite .",
    ".physical parameters of the ncds [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     all materials used to construct the ncd array were selected for low levels of thorium and uranium .",
    "the goal for the ncd array was to limit the thorium and uranium impurities in the ncds so the photodisintegration background produced by each was less than 1% of the nc neutron production rate .",
    "this equates to less than 0.5 @xmath17 g of @xmath15th and less than 3.8 @xmath17 g of @xmath16u in the entire ncd array .",
    "some ncd components , such as the cables and the anchor assemblies , had less stringent radiopurity requirements because they were concentrated near the av , so photodisintegration neutrons produced there were more likely to capture on hydrogen in the av .",
    "radiopurity specifications for each component of the ncds were established based on the total mass of that component in the array and its location within the av .",
    "the nickel ncd bodies had the most stringent radiopurity specification because they dominated the mass of the array and were centrally located in the av .    to verify that the levels of thorium and uranium impurities met specifications , material samples and components were radioassayed by radiochemical neutron - activation analysis ( rnaa ) or by direct counting at the oroville dam low - background counting facility operated by lawrence berkeley national laboratory .",
    "results of these radioassays are shown in table [ radio ] .",
    "most of the parts listed in this table consist of several smaller components .",
    "each of the smaller components was assayed separately , then the assay results were combined and converted into a total contribution from the entire ncd array ( in @xmath17 g ) . also shown are individual assay results ( in pg / g ) for some of the components that contribute the largest total contamination to the ncd parts .",
    "the nickel bodies of the ncds were not assayed extensively for uranium because the half - life of @xmath20np ( 2.4 days ) is inconveniently short to perform rnaa for uranium , and because direct counting does not have the necessary sensitivity for the ncd bodies .",
    "preliminary rnaa measurements found only upper limits ranging from 1 pg / g to 5 pg / g , indicating that the uranium impurity levels were acceptable .",
    "for all the ncd parts , the total thorium levels were consistent with zero , and in some cases only an upper limit is quoted because many of the components had thorium levels well below the sensitivity of the assay .",
    "the quoted cable impurity levels are only for the portion of the cables below the cable bends , since cables above that point were contained within the neck and produced negligible numbers of photodisintegration neutrons that could capture in the fiducial volume or the ncds .",
    "another possible source of contamination is radon , which is typically present at the level of 1  pci / l ( 37 bq / m@xmath0 ) in indoor air , and which has been measured at about three times that level in the sno laboratory @xcite .",
    "radon isotopes and their daughters are all too short - lived to be of much concern for ncd construction , with one exception , @xmath22pb from @xmath23rn decay .",
    "this 22-year activity accumulates on surfaces exposed to radon - laden air , and presents a serious threat to low - background counting experiments .",
    "the low - energy beta decay of @xmath22pb leads to @xmath22bi ( t@xmath24  days ) , which decays via a 1.2-mev beta to @xmath22po ( t@xmath25  days ) .",
    "the 5.3-mev alpha from @xmath22po produces in a proportional counter a peak with a wall - effect tail that underlies the 764-kev neutron - capture line .",
    "there exists medically - motivated literature on the fate of radon daughters @xcite .",
    "when @xmath23rn reaches equilibrium in a space , the concentration is supported against decay and ventilation losses by emanation from construction materials and the ground .",
    "radon daughters can migrate directly to a surface and be deposited , or they can with much higher probability attach to airborne particulates , which then migrate more slowly before also depositing on surfaces .",
    "to first order , the naive expectation that every radon decay eventually leads to a surface - fixed daughter is borne out . based on the ` jacobi model ' @xcite , @xmath22po surface activity reaches 1  alpha / m@xmath26day in under an hour in a typical indoor environment .",
    "alpha activity from @xmath22po on the inner surface of the ncds can serve as a continuous calibration , and therefore may not be entirely unwelcome . for the ncds ,",
    "the fraction of surface alpha events in the tail underlying the neutron - capture signal region is at least an order of magnitude lower than for a bulk contaminant , so the relative impact on the neutron signal extraction is much smaller .",
    "in addition , the @xmath23rn daughters that attach to surfaces are below @xmath14bi in the @xmath16u chain , so they do not introduce photodisintegration neutron backgrounds . despite these facts",
    ", it was undesirable to introduce large amounts of surface @xmath22po on the ncds .    as discussed in section [ tubes ] , the nickel tubes were inadvertently exposed to high - radon air while stored underground during their construction , necessitating the addition of an electropolishing step to the construction procedures . after the electropolish , care was taken to minimize additional radon exposure . the radon level in the university of washington cleanroom where the detector fabrication took place",
    "was found to be below 0.25 pci / l .",
    "although this is a low level , several precautions were also taken , including heat - sealing tubes and endcaps in nylon cleanroom bags , minimizing exposure to room air , and excluding air inside the tubes in favor of boil - off nitrogen or vacuum whenever possible .",
    "preliminary studies of data from the entire ncd array show @xmath22po alpha rates that vary from 0.3  alphas / m@xmath26day to above 9  alphas / m@xmath26day on different strings , with an average over the entire ncd array of about 2 alphas / m@xmath26day @xcite .",
    "however , no correlation is evident between the amount of time ( if any ) that an ncd tube was stored underground in the high - radon environment during construction and the final @xmath22po activity of the ncd produced from that tube .",
    "this suggests that the electropolishing procedure was successful and that small amounts of surface contamination were introduced subsequent to the electropolishing , despite the precautions taken to minimize this exposure .",
    "[ podecay ]    initial measurements of a completed ncd showed @xmath22po activity of about 40 alphas / m@xmath26day between 4.5 mev and 6 mev , which was tracked for approximately one @xmath22po half - life .",
    "the activity was seen to decay with the 138-day half - life @xcite , as shown in figure [ podecay ] . however , subsequent studies about six years later showed residual @xmath22po activity of approximately two alphas / m@xmath26day of all energies averaged over the entire ncd array , significantly higher than would be expected if the 138-day decay had continued .",
    "tracking of this activity from june 5 , 2004 to january 3 , 2005 indicated no measurable decrease in the activity , providing evidence that the remaining @xmath22po activity is now supported by 22-year @xmath22pb .",
    "the primary background to the 764-kev ncd neutron - capture signal arose from alpha decays that did not deposit their full energy in the active volume of the ncd .",
    "in addition to the use of pulse - shape discrimination to distinguish neutron - capture signals from alpha backgrounds , several different techniques were used to measure and characterize the alpha backgrounds in the ncd array .",
    "studies of the energy spectrum of the alpha events above the region where the neutron signal falls provided constraints on the rates of alphas from different sources .",
    "in addition , a time - coincidence analysis took advantage of short - lived alpha emitters in the thorium and uranium decay chains to provide precise measurements of the levels of these impurities , particularly @xmath15th .",
    "po alphas , reduced in apparent energy by space - charge effects .",
    "the curve is an unbinned maximum - likelihood fit using alpha energy pdfs based on simulations . ]",
    "[ alphaspec ]    figure [ alphaspec ] shows an energy spectrum of events above 1 mev from data taken during the initial period of production data - taking .",
    "the dominant feature is the 5.3-mev @xmath22po peak , which is reduced somewhat in apparent energy by space - charge effects .",
    "a binned maximum - likelihood fit to the energy spectrum using probability density functions from simulations of surface @xmath22po and bulk thorium- and uranium - chain activity is also shown .",
    "the simulations assumed that equilibrium in the thorium and uranium chains had been broken by preferential removal of radium during the cvd process .",
    "the results of this preliminary analysis indicate that the @xmath22po activity is @xmath27 alphas / m@xmath26day in the energy region above 1 mev , and the combined activity from the thorium and uranium chains is @xmath28 alphas / m@xmath26day in the energy region above 1 mev @xcite .",
    "the energy distribution of the alpha events shows that the amount of surface thorium and uranium contamination on the insides of the ncd tubes is negligibly small .    by selecting pairs or triplets of alpha events with short time intervals between them , it is possible to identify these events as coming from specific decays in the thorium and uranium chains , with low rates of accidental coincidences . in the uranium chain ,",
    "the half - life of @xmath29po is 3.05 minutes . in the thorium chain ,",
    "the half - life of @xmath30rn is 55.6 seconds and the half - life of @xmath31po is 0.15 second , thus it is possible to observe the triple coincidence between the alphas from @xmath32ra , @xmath30rn , and @xmath31po .",
    "the result of this preliminary analysis on data taken during ncd commissioning and the initial period of production data - taking was @xmath33 @xmath15th decays / m@xmath26day and @xmath33 @xmath16u decays / m@xmath26day @xcite .",
    "this result can be compared to the @xmath34 @xmath15th decays / m@xmath26day and @xmath35 @xmath16u decays / m@xmath26day obtained from the energy spectrum fits described above .    the thorium activity measured by these two analysis techniques is equivalent to a @xmath15th impurity level of @xmath36 pg / g @xcite , which is about six times higher than the @xmath37 pg / g measured in the cvd nickel radioassay .",
    "the uranium activity measured with these alpha analyses is equivalent to a @xmath16u impurity level of @xmath38 pg / g , consistent with the upper limit of 5 pg / g obtained from the preliminary uranium radioassays performed on the ncd nickel .    by using simulation to project these measured alpha rates below 1 mev ,",
    "the total alpha rate in the neutron - capture energy range from 155 kev to 800 kev was calculated to be @xmath39 alphas per day in the 36 @xmath0he ncd strings @xcite , about five times the signal expected from neutrons produced by neutral - current interactions .",
    "although this signal - to - background ratio is not favorable , the distinctive shape of the neutron - capture energy spectrum can be used to extract the neutron - capture signal from the alpha background to an accuracy of approximately 5% using energy information alone .",
    "taking advantage of the additional information available in the digitized pulses is expected to improve separation of the neutron - capture signal .",
    "photodisintegration induced by @xmath13tl and @xmath14bi gammas was the primary source of neutron background in sno . in the previous phases of sno ,",
    "trace amounts of @xmath15th and @xmath16u daughters in the d@xmath2o were the dominant source of this neutron background and this was quantified by ex - situ and in - situ techniques @xcite .",
    "ex - situ measurements involved regular assays of the d@xmath2o using three complementary techniques @xcite .",
    "the in - situ technique measured the cherenkov light from @xmath13tl and @xmath14bi decays and used the difference in the isotropy of the light from the events to measure the amount of each isotope present . only the in - situ technique",
    "could be used to measure the additional photodisintegration background originating from the ncd array .    to separate cherenkov signals originating on the ncds from those originating in the d@xmath2o , the difference between their radial distributions was exploited . by placing cylindrical cuts around each ncd string , the radial profile of each background component",
    "could be studied and the origin of the cherenkov light deduced .",
    "preliminary studies indicate that it is possible to separate activity originating in the d@xmath2o from that on an ncd , but it is not possible to differentiate between the two ncd components , @xmath13tl and @xmath14bi .",
    "the isotropy of the light seen in the pmts , which was typically used to distinguish between @xmath13tl and @xmath14bi , could not be used for ncd activity because the betas were attenuated by the nickel body of the ncd .",
    "almost all @xmath13tl decays emit a gamma that is capable of photodisintegration , compared to @xmath14bi where the probability is around 2.14% .",
    "however , since only the gammas escape into the water to be detected , the lack of knowledge about whether they came from @xmath16u or @xmath15th turns out to be less important .",
    "the uncertainty in the neutron photodisintegration rate caused by activity within the ncds is less than a factor of two , rather than the factor of 50 suggested by the branching ratios .",
    "assuming that all of the ncd activity is thallium - like provides a worst - case estimate of the photodisintegration background rate that could be a factor of two too large .",
    "this estimate gives a @xmath15th impurity level comparable to that measured with the ncd alpha analyses .",
    "the photodisintegration neutron rate from this amount of @xmath15th is expected to be approximately 0.25 neutron produced per day .",
    "in addition , the in - situ analysis is sensitive to ` hot spots ' of increased localized activity on part of an ncd .",
    "two such hot spots have been identified , one on k2 and one on k5 .",
    "preliminary studies of the hotter of the two , on k5 , indicate that it is expected to produce no more than a few percent of the nc neutron rate , and that most of these photodisintegration neutrons recaptured on the k5 string .",
    "there is evidence that this hot spot was caused by external surface activity introduced during deployment of this ncd string .",
    "alpha counting and destructive assays of this hotspot are underway in an attempt to identify the composition of this hot spot , with the intent of reducing the uncertainty on the photodisintegration background it produces .      the preliminary ncd nickel impurity measurements of @xmath36 pg @xmath15th / g and @xmath38 pg @xmath16u / g are much lower than the levels in commercially - available @xmath0he proportional counters , or even any @xmath0he proportional counters designed for previous low - background applications .",
    "typical low - background @xmath0he proportional counters are concerned only with alpha contamination of the neutron - capture signal , and not also with photodisintegration neutron production , as in the case of the sno experiment .",
    "thus the region of concern for contamination is only the inner tens of microns of the proportional - counter wall , so applying a low - background coating to the inner wall is an effective background - reduction technique .",
    "a group at university of california at irvine prepared copper - coated stainless steel @xmath0he proportional counters that reduced the alpha rate from @xmath40  alphas / m@xmath26day with untreated stainless steel to @xmath41  alphas / m@xmath26day with the electroplated copper coating @xcite .",
    "a soviet group coated the inner surface of stainless steel @xmath0he proportional counters with 60 microns of an `` organofluorine compound having an activity 10 times less than the steel '' and observed rates of about @xmath42  alphas / m@xmath26day @xcite .",
    "the ncd rate of 4 alphas / m@xmath26day across the entire spectrum is orders of magnitude below the rates achieved by these previous detectors .",
    "the sudbury neutrino observatory s ability to measure the total flux of all active neutrinos from the sun above 2.2 mev via neutral - current interactions was enhanced by the addition of the ncds .",
    "these 40 strings of @xmath0he and @xmath3he proportional counters occupied the central region of the sno acrylic vessel on a 1-meter grid .",
    "the neutron - capture efficiency of the ncd array has been preliminarily measured to be @xmath43 for uniformly distributed neutrons .",
    "the ncd signal was completely independent of the pmt array , allowing nc neutrons that captured in the ncds to be identified separately from cc and es signals in the pmts .    the main consideration in the design of the ncd array was the reduction of radioactive impurities .",
    "photodisintegration induced by @xmath13tl and @xmath14bi gammas was the primary source of neutron backgrounds to a nc flux measurement in sno , and thus strict controls of all thorium and uranium contamination were required . additionally , the primary background to the 764-kev neutron - capture signal was alpha decays that did not deposit their full energy in the active volume of the ncd , and thus any alpha - producing impurities on or near the inner surface of the ncd bodies were also a concern .",
    "a variety of innovative materials and techniques were used to construct and install the ncds , and extensive testing and optimization was carried out before , during , and after deployment of the ncd array to ensure technical feasibility and data quality .",
    "preliminary measurements indicate that the photodisintegration neutron background produced by bulk thorium and uranium impurities in the ncd array was about 2% of the nc neutron rate .",
    "neutron backgrounds produced by ncd surface hot spots have been limited to no more than a few percent of the nc rate .",
    "the photodisintegration neutron background produced by the ncd array appears to be slightly higher than originally anticipated , but additional analyses of the hot spots are underway with the goal of reducing the systematic uncertainties associated with this background to within acceptable limits .    a total observed rate of less than 4 alphas / m@xmath26day for the entire array of 63.52 m@xmath44 has been achieved . in the neutron - capture energy region of interest below 1 mev ,",
    "the total alpha rate was @xmath39 per day in the @xmath0he portion of the array .",
    "this is an improvement of orders of magnitude over previous low - background proportional counters .",
    "preliminary studies of the efficacy of the pulse - shape analysis techniques under development indicate that the alpha rates in the ncd data can be significantly reduced with a small loss of the neutron - capture signal .",
    "data - taking in the ncd phase of sno began in november 2004 and ended in november 2006 .",
    "a blind analysis of the data acquired is underway .",
    "overall , the ncd - phase goal of creating a robust array of low - background @xmath0he proportional counters capable of taking data for several years while submerged in ultrapure heavy water has been met .",
    "this work was supported primarily by the united states department of energy office of science and by los alamos laboratory - directed research and development .",
