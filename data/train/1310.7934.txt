    "the atomic gases in many cold atom experiments are confined in harmonic traps . an important consequence of this kind of confinement is that , in the absence of any additional external perturbation , the centre of mass of the system oscillates about the centre of the trap in simple harmonic motion without dissipation .",
    "this particular collective oscillation is referred to as the centre of mass or dipole mode . according to the generalized kohn theorem  @xcite ,",
    "this behaviour is a generic property of a harmonically - confined system in which the interactions between particles depend only on their relative separation , and is independent of other intrinsic properties such as dimensionality , quantum statistics and the state of internal excitation . for these reasons ,",
    "the undamped dipole oscillation can in fact be used to accurately determine the trapping frequencies  @xcite in situations where the experimental parameters defining the trapping potential are not known precisely .",
    "an additional , but more subtle , implication of such confinement is the content of the so - called harmonic potential theorem ( hpt )  @xcite .",
    "in essence , the hpt demonstrates the existence of a class of dynamical many - body states for which the probability density moves without change in shape .",
    "this theorem imposes important constraints on the form of approximate theories which deal with the dynamics of harmonically - confined many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "when the harmonicity of the confining potential is compromised , however , the centre of mass is coupled to the internal degrees of freedom and its dynamics becomes sensitive to the intrinsic properties of the system , including the specific form of the particle interactions .",
    "for this reason , the dipole oscillation can serve as an experimental diagnostic of various perturbations acting on the system .",
    "for instance , several experiments  @xcite have used dipole oscillations to study the transport of a bose - condensate through a disordered medium or past a localized impurity . although the motion of the condensate in these experiments does not lose its collectivity",
    ", dissipation does occur and leads to the damping of the centre of mass motion .",
    "another experimental example is provided by the dipole oscillation of a trapped bose gas in the presence of an optical lattice potential  @xcite .",
    "here it was found the that dimensionality of the bose gas plays a critical role in determining the way in which the centre of mass behaves as a function of time .    in all of these experiments ,",
    "the dipole oscillation of the atomic system is initiated by an abrupt displacement of the trapping potential along a certain axial direction .",
    "if the displacement is large , the system begins its evolution in a highly non - equilibrium initial state .",
    "it is partly for this reason that much of the theoretical work dealing with the collective dynamics of bose - condensed systems relies on numerical simulations of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to show that this nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of the external perturbation can be considered from a different point of view when the system is harmonically confined . by means of an appropriate transformation , one can equivalently think of the system as being driven out of an initial _ equilibrium _ state by a _ dynamic _ external perturbation oscillating sinusoidally at the frequency of the trap .",
    "the availability of this alternate point of view is a consequence of what we refer to as the _ extended _ hpt .",
    "its advantage is that the external perturbation can be treated by conventional linear response theory , at least when the perturbation is sufficiently weak .",
    "this approach was used effectively in an earlier paper  @xcite to determine the damping of the centre of mass motion due to a disorder potential .",
    "a second purpose of this paper is to study the response of a harmonically - confined system to an external potential which is made to oscillate at an _ arbitrary _ frequency .",
    "our discussion is motivated by a recent proposal  @xcite to probe the optical conductivity of a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice by shaking the lattice periodically along a certain direction .",
    "this is an interesting idea since it provides a method of addressing experimentally the optical conductivity of a system consisting of _ neutral _ atoms .",
    "however , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite only considered bosons within a _ uniform _ lattice , while in most experiments the atoms are also subjected to a harmonic potential . in this paper",
    ", we show that one can also probe directly the optical conductivity of a gas that experiences a _ combination _ of a harmonic trapping potential and an arbitrary external potential when the latter is made to oscillate sinusoidally with a small amplitude .",
    "this generalization provides a precise link between theoretical calculations of the optical conductivity and possible experimental measurements on harmonically - confined gases in the presence of various external perturbations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we provide a basic discussion of the dipole modes of a harmonically - confined system . in sec .  3",
    ", we consider the response of a harmonically - confined system to a time - dependent homogeneous force .",
    "an explicit expression for the evolution operator of the system is obtained which motivates the introduction of a rather useful unitary displacement operator .",
    "these results are then used to provide an alternative derivation of the hpt .",
    "we next consider in sec .",
    "4 situations in which the system is perturbed by an additional external potential that couples the centre of mass and internal degrees of freedom . here",
    "we present a derivation of the extended hpt . in sec .  5",
    ", we consider the energy absorption rate and centre of mass dynamics of a harmonically - confined gas that is subjected to an oscillating external potential and demonstrate that both aspects serve to probe the optical conductivity of the system .",
    "all of our findings are summarized in sec .",
    "as a preliminary to the the development of the hpt and its extension , we discuss in this section the dipole modes of a harmonically - confined system and the underlying physics for the existence of such modes .",
    "the dipole modes are the low - lying collective excitations that have frequencies equal to the frequencies of the trap . unlike other low - lying excitations , the frequencies of these modes are independent of the total number of trapped atoms and the atomic interactions . for bose - condensed systems ,",
    "these modes are often discussed in the context of mean - field theory , namely as solutions to the time - dependent gp equation .",
    "however , it can be shown rigorously that such dipole modes exist for any harmonically - confined ( bosonic or fermionic ) system in which interactions depend only on the relative coordinates of the particles .",
    "the fundamental reason behind this is that the centre of mass degree of freedom is separable from all the internal degrees of freedom , which implies that there are excitations associated solely with motion of the centre of mass .    to demonstrate this",

    "[ rp_com ] it follows from these results that the centre of mass hamiltonian @xmath7 commutes with @xmath8 .",

    "this undamped harmonic oscillation of the centre of mass coordinate is the dipole oscillation we have been referring to .",
