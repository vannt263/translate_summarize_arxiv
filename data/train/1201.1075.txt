    "<S> polycrystalline samples of the isostructural alloys uni@xmath0co@xmath1si@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) were studied by means of x - ray powder diffraction , magnetization , electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements , at temperatures down to 2  k and in magnetic fields up to 5  t. the experimental data revealed an evolution from strongly anisotropic ferromagnetism with pronounced kondo effect , observed for the alloys with @xmath4 and being gradually suppressed with rising co - content , to spin - glass - like states with dominant spin fluctuations , seen for the sample with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolation of the value of @xmath6 yields a critical concentration @xmath7 , at which the magnetic ordering entirely disappears . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is in line with preliminary data collected for stoichiometric ucosi@xmath2 . </S>"
