    "spontaneous emission of atoms is not an immutable property , but can be altered essentially via two different mechanisms .",
    "one mechanism involves modification of the internal dynamics .",
    "for example , quantum interference among different decay channels of the atom can be established , such that spontaneous emission is modified to a great extend  @xcite .",
    "a particular class of quantum interference schemes that has received much theoretical attention in the literature is based on so - called spontaneously generated coherences ( sgc ) .",
    "these coherences have for example been shown to lead to quenching of spontaneous emission  @xcite , narrow spectral lines  @xcite , phase - dependent line shapes  @xcite , and rapid phase control of collective population dynamics  @xcite . despite the large theoretical interest , there is no experimental proof of this type of sgc in atomic systems due to the lack of appropriate candidate systems .",
    "the reason for this is that sgc based interference requires the presence of near - degenerate atomic transitions with near ( anti-)parallel dipole moments sharing a common atomic state , which does not occur in real atoms  @xcite . to circumvent this in atoms ,",
    "schemes to simulate interference or to induce interference by external driving fields have been considered  @xcite , but so far without clear experimental implementation .",
    "an experimental observation of sgc in molecules  @xcite could not be confirmed in a repetition of the experiment  @xcite .",
    "sgc have been observed , however , in artificial quantum systems , where a suitable level scheme can be designed  @xcite .",
    "also , it has been recognized that a more general form of sgc occurs between near - degenerate atomic transitions with near ( anti-)parallel dipole moments that do not share a common state .",
    "this generalized sgc may lead to measurable effects in realistic atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "these generalized sgc are also a common interpretation for the occurrence of electromagnetically induced absorption  @xcite .",
    "the second major mechanism for a modification of spontaneous emission is to modify the electromagnetic boundary conditions surrounding the atom , such as in cavities  @xcite .",
    "recently , is has been shown that a favorable modification of the boundary conditions is possible in media having a negative refractive index ( nri ) .",
    "nri currently receive a lot of attention because of both experimental demonstrations and potential applications  @xcite .",
    "for example , nri material allows to realize superlenses which , in principle , can achieve arbitrary sub - wavelength resolution  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the nri materials have been realized over a wide range of frequencies , from the microwave up to the optical range  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that a single layer of a nri material has broadband omnidirectional reflection properties . in the range between the electric plasma frequency and the magnetic plasma frequency , the refractive index is close to zero and the nri materials reflect radiation for angles of incidence and polarization with reflectivity of @xmath1 . by exploiting the reflective phase properties of the nri materials , an all - dimensional subwavelength resonator",
    "@xcite has been designed and fabricated . in the field of quantum optics , two atoms placed at the foci of a perfect lens formed by a nri slab exhibit perfect sub- and superradiance over macroscopic distances  @xcite .",
    "such focussing and phase compensation can also be used to induce quantum interference  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) schematic setup for spontaneous decay in a waveguide with negative index of refraction material .",
    "( a ) the waveguide consists of an inner layer with material parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and thickness @xmath4 .",
    "it is surrounded by infinite outer layers with material parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . in the middle layer , an atom is embedded at position @xmath8 .",
    "( b ) electronic structure of the embedded atom , which is a three - level atom in @xmath0-type configuration . ]    in a nri slab waveguide  @xcite , surface guided modes may exist for imaginary transverse wave numbers , with power concentrated at the interfaces rather than inside the slab . in an air waveguide with nri cladding  @xcite , both transverse electric and magnetic modes can be supported with low losses . the existence of the transverse electric ( te ) surface guided modes in the nri slab waveguide , where the permeability changes its sign at the interface , resemble the transverse magnetic ( tm ) surface - plasmon - polariton modes at the interface between the metal and the dielectric , where the permittivity changes its sign  @xcite .",
    "plasmonic - based nanophotonic devices have attracted much interest from the quantum optics community for their use in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "a technique which enables strong , coherent coupling between individual optical emitters and guided plasmon excitations in conducting nanostructure at optical frequencies has been proposed  @xcite . in view of these remarkable properties of nri structures ,",
    "the question arises , how spontaneous emission is modified in such a surrounding .",
    "therefore , here we study the spontaneous emission ( se ) of an atom embedded in the middle layer of nri slab waveguides .",
    "the atom is modelled as a v - type three - level atom with orthogonal dipole moments on the dipole - allowed transitions as it is the case in real atoms .",
    "the nri layer is described using a drude - lorentz model including dispersion and absorption . the different contributions to se are first classified and interpreted using approximate analytical results .",
    "then , we verify our results via numerical calculations .",
    "we find that at low absorption , the se rate into particular waveguide modes can be several orders of magnitude larger than the free space rate due to a strong enhancement of the mode density .",
    "further , in thin waveguides , a dominant contribution to se arises from surface guided modes , which do not occur in regular positive index waveguides . at high absorption , the strong enhancement of waveguide modes is reduced , while the surface guided mode contribution remains several orders of magnitude higher than free space decay . as our main result",
    ", we show that the asymmetric mode structure and the strong enhancement of particular modes can be used to engineer spontaneous emission interference between the two transitions in the embedded atom .",
    "thus we find that the nri waveguide allows to induce and control near - perfect quantum interference in realistic atomic level schemes .",

    "<S> the spontaneous decay of a @xmath0-type three - level atom placed in a negative - refractive - index waveguide is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in thin waveguides , highly efficient surface guided modes are supported , which do not occur in positive index waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , at low absorption , the mode density and thus spontaneous emission into particular regular guided modes is enhanced by several orders of magnitude as compared to regular dielectric waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetries between emission into the different modes and the enhancement of particular guided modes allow to induce strong spontaneous - emission interference between transitions with orthogonal transition dipole moments . </S>"
