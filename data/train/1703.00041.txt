    "we have lost the geometrical meaning of the generators , so we may rename the generators , if necessary , and unify the two cases , so we have the following proposition .

    "those dual presentations play a central role in the proofs of properties of the knot group and the alexander polynomial of knots , see @xcite . by studying these presentations",
    "we find a similar algorithm to the known one to find the 2-bridge link group , that has an explicit formula depending of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "of course , we need a more elaborate algorithm .",
    "we take as generators of @xmath18 the meridians around the underarcs , see [ fig5]_c . _ again , the key point is to use the cyclic decomposition of @xmath17 .",

    "the graphical procedure to find the relators is : each time we cross the link we encounter one of the vertices in the set @xmath235 we identify the underarc , say @xmath132 , and the sign of the crossing , @xmath236 and write @xmath237 , with @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
