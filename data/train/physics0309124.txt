    "the concept of reaction mechanism plays a major role in chemistry and represents a synthesis of our understanding of the way in which different topological changes in the bonding structure of a reactant or product are correlated as the reaction proceeds .",
    "recent advances in ultrafast lasers@xcite , x - ray@xcite and other spectroscopies as well as in computational chemistry@xcite have made possible the study of most gas - phase and some condensed - phase reactions in molecular detail . however , most experimental investigations of complex reaction mechanisms taking place in liquid environments are still inferred from isotope and solvent ( medium ) effects on the reaction rate@xcite .",
    "consequently , the interpretation of the experimental results as well as the reaction mechanisms inferred are more controversial than those of gas - phase reactions .",
    "computer studies can be useful as a complement to experimental data in cases where experiments alone can not provide a definitive picture of the mechanism of the chemical process .",
    "it is therefore desirable to develop systematic computational approaches to carefully examine the relation between isotope effects and reaction mechanism in condensed phase systems .",
    "however , computational calculations of kinetic isotope effects in condensed - phase reactions can become expensive due to a number of difficulties .",
    "some of the practical challenges involving the calculation of kinetic isotope effects and reaction rates in solution are associated with the fact that accurate descriptions of transformations in which chemical bonds are broken and formed require time - consuming _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods .",
    "computer time limitations become particularly relevant when investigating `` rare events '' such as chemical reactions , especially when the reactions are accompanied by substantial differences in the structure of the solvent . to further complicate matters , quantum effects such as zero - point vibrations and tunneling effects are important in some chemical processes , such as proton transfer reactions . another technical problem in the simulations of reactive systems",
    "is that the statistical resolution of calculations of the reaction rate depends on how many statistically independent configurations are obtained during the simulation : simulations in which a large number of successive configurations have similar configurations of the reactive core or of the solvent molecules suffer from large uncertainties in the calculated reaction rates , precluding any definitive interpretation of the reaction mechanism .",
    "it is therefore critical to develop methods which sample statistically independent configurations along the reaction path rapidly and correctly . in the case where the reaction path can be characterized by means of a small number of reaction",
    "coordinates , accurate , statistically well - resolved calculations of reaction rates can be performed by developing improved methods for computing reaction free energy profiles along these reaction coordinates .",
    "a number of techniques for computing free energy profiles along reaction coordinates have been proposed in the literature , including umbrella sampling@xcite , thermodynamic integration in conjunction with the blue - moon ensemble method@xcite , projection methods@xcite , variable transformation approaches@xcite and guiding potentials@xcite .",
    "the use of molecular mechanics - based guiding potentials was proposed simultaneously and independently by iftimie et al.@xcite and vondele et al.@xcite and implemented in a monte carlo and a molecular dynamics framework , respectively .",
    "the basic idea of the method consists of using a `` fast '' _ molecular mechanics _ potential to guide a computationally intensive _ ab initio _ simulation .",
    "the monte carlo version of the `` guiding '' approach in reference [ was called the molecular mechanics based importance function method ( mmbif ) . it was demonstrated that the utilization of a reasonably accurate molecular mechanics potential as an importance function decreases the correlation of an _ ab initio _ monte carlo calculation by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the method was illustrated on a gas - phase formic acid - water system in which the activated processes involved breaking and forming hydrogen bonds@xcite , and was successfully applied to calculate the kinetic isotope effects in a model gas - phase intramolecular proton transfer reaction@xcite .",
    "one of the major challenges in _ ab initio _ simulations of reactions in condensed phase environments is to thoroughly sample configurations of the system when changes in the solvent occur on long time scales .",
    "for instance , in molecular dynamics simulations of proton transfer reactions in which the collective behavior of the solvent can strongly influence the dynamics of the reaction , the sampling efficiency can be limited by long solvent dielectric relaxation time .",
    "in essence , an independent configuration of the system requires that the equations of motion be propagated for a time which is longer than the dielectric relaxation time .",
    "even simple organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran , the relevant solvent in this study , have dielectric relaxation times on the order of @xmath0 ps@xcite , so that independent solvent configurations are only obtained after several thousand elementary propagation steps .",
    "more structured solvents such as water , with a dielectric relaxation time of roughly @xmath1 ps@xcite , require even longer propagation for proper sampling of solvent configurations .",
    "the long time scale of structural rearrangements in solvents pose a serious challenge to _ ab initio _ calculations even when the solvent is modeled using molecular mechanics since each propagation step in the dynamics involves a time - consuming _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "ideally , successive configurations in a simulation involve drastically different solvent and solute configurations .",
    "this is only possible using an artificial dynamics to generate the sequence of configurations .",
    "one way to generate relatively uncorrelated successive configurations is to apply importance sampling ideas .    in this paper ,",
    "the molecular mechanics - based importance sampling method is adapted to calculate reaction rates of chemical processes in condensed phases where collective motions of the environment can influence the quantitative features of the chemical process and , in some cases , play a critical role in determining the mechanism of a reaction .",
    "the monte carlo procedure involves separating the task of sampling the configurations of the condensed phase system into two parts .",
    "the first part involves an efficient scheme of updating the solvent configuration while the second focuses on the relatively slow _ ab initio _ calculation of the reactive core .",
    "this approach allows extensive sampling of the molecular mechanical solvent without a significant increase in the overall computational work over a gas phase _ ab initio _ simulation .",
    "the method is applied to study the double proton transfer reaction in an acetic acid - methanol complex solvated by tetrahydrofuran .",
    "the computational study of proton - transfer reactions can be used to understand the conditions for the validity of a well - known conjecture proposed in the physical organic chemistry literature , stating that the breakdown of the rule of geometric mean for kinetic isotope effects , which is a relation@xcite involving ratios of kinetic isotope effects corresponding to different isotopic substitutions at the primary and secondary atoms , is a signature of tunneling for both primary and secondary atoms@xcite .",
    "the consequences of applying the rule of geometric mean to interpret experimentally determined isotope effects are of far - reaching importance : the inferred relationship between the rule of geometric mean and reaction mechanism forms the basis for the proposal that _ multiple _ _ intramolecular _ proton transfer reactions are likely to proceed via a two - step mechanism , in contrast to _ multiple intermolecular _ proton transfers which are believed to proceed via a synchronous pathway@xcite .",
    "the same relationship is at the heart of the recent suggestion that tunneling effects have played an important role in the design of the active sites of some proteins@xcite .",
    "some of the most striking consequences of the rule of geometric mean@xcite appear when studying multiple proton transfer reactions in condensed phases .",
    "the study of reactions involving the exchange of a pair of protons between two molecules may provide insight into the dynamics of certain types of enzymatic reactions in which several functional groups in the active center are properly aligned so that concerted catalysis can occur .",
    "this type of catalysis mechanism is called _ bifunctional catalysis _ and is the principal mechanism responsible for the several orders of magnitude increase in the reaction rate in several important biochemical transformations @xcite .",
    "the double proton transfer reaction between acetic acid and methanol is one of the simplest examples of reactions involving an intermolecular exchange of protons between two molecules and therefore is a good candidate for computationally investigating general aspects of bifunctional catalysis .",
    "the chemical processes occurring in a solution of acetic acid - methanol in tetrahydrofuran ( thf ) have been studied experimentally by gerritzen and limbach@xcite .",
    "the majority species in the system consist of complexes formed from either a single molecule of acetic acid or a single molecule of methanol hydrogen - bonded with a single molecule of solvent .",
    "the minority species in the system consist of linear and cyclic clusters of acetic acid hydrogen - bonded with methanol and solvated by tetrahydrofuran .",
    "the double - proton transfer reaction takes place along the hydrogen bonds of the cyclic clusters .",
    "when the concentrations of acetic acid and methanol are reduced , the only cyclic cluster formed within which double - proton transfer is experimentally observed is formed from one molecule of acetic acid and a single molecule of methanol@xcite ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    in this work",
    ", we will focus only on the intermolecular double proton transfer which takes place in the cyclic cluster formed from one molecule of methanol and a single molecule of acetic acid in a solution of tetrahydrofuran ( thf ) .",
    "the quantum nuclear effects due to the small mass of the hydrogen atoms will be neglected here , and we will concentrate only on the sampling issues . once the sampling method is tested for classical atoms , the method will be developed in a later article to include nuclear quantum effects via centroid transition state theory using sampling ideas similar to those used in our previous studies of malonaldehyde@xcite .",
    "since it is impractical to treat large systems quantum mechanically , one is inevitably faced with the decision of how to combine _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods with more empirical approaches .",
    "one alternative to full _ ab initio _ calculations consists of using a mixed quantum - mechanical / molecular - mechanical ( qm / mm ) description of the system .",
    "however , in general it is problematic to clearly define the physics of the interface region between the quantum and molecular mechanical subsystems . in the best of circumstances ,",
    "the separation can be made without `` cutting '' a covalent bond .",
    "for reactive processes in which the reaction occurs in a small solute which can be simulated in isolation using _ ab initio _ methods , the logical separation between the quantum and molecular mechanical regions is at the solute - solvent level .",
    "that is , the energies of the solute in which the reaction is occurring are calculated using electronic structure methods for the solute in the presence of the solvent , while the solvent energies are described by molecular mechanical potentials .",
    "even after this separation has been defined , one is faced with another technical issue of how an infinite condensed phase system can be represented in a practical fashion .",
    "one common approach utilized in simulations of condensed phase systems is to simulate explicitly a system consisting of a solute surrounded by a small number of solvent molecules periodically replicated in an infinite fashion .",
    "unfortunately , such a periodic replication of the system introduces artifacts .",
    "one such artifact is the existence of spurious long - ranged correlations due to the periodicity of the system . in principle",
    ", such correlations could have a large impact on the reactive process .",
    "the use of periodic boundary conditions also introduces complexity in the electronic structure calculation itself when localized basis sets are used .",
    "an alternative approach is to use toroidal boundary conditions in which part of the solvent is explicitly represented while the influence of the solvent from regions far from the solute is implicitly incorporated .    in the present study",
    "we have utilized a quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics / implicit solvent ( qm / mm / continuum ) approach , in which the bond breaking and forming processes taking place in the solute are described by including all solute electron - electron , electron - nuclei and nuclei - nuclei interactions in an electronic hamiltonian .",
    "the interactions between the solvent molecules which form the first few solvation shells ( in practice , @xmath2 thf molecules ) are described using a molecular mechanics potential .",
    "the electrostatic interactions between the solute and the solvent molecules in the first few solvation shells are incorporated into this approach by solving the _ ab initio _ electronic structure equations for the solute in the presence of the electric field generated by the molecular mechanics solvent charges .",
    "the total energy of the system also includes the lennard - jones interaction energy between solute and the solvent molecules in the first solvation shells , and the reaction field energy which accounts for the long - range electrostatic interactions between solute and solvent molecules ( see fig .",
    "the simulations were performed using the toroidal boundary conditions approach@xcite , in which a cutoff distance is used that sets the boundaries of the region within which intermolecular interactions are explicitly counted .",
    "therefore , the only quantum electron - electron , electron - nuclei and nuclei - nuclei interactions which were explicitly counted in the present treatment were those which correspond to atoms separated by less than the cutoff distance , here chosen to be @xmath3 angstroms .",
    "the effects of the neglected interactions in the toroidal boundary conditions approach have been approximately accounted for by adding reaction field corrections@xcite to the electronic energy@xcite :    @xmath4    where the sum is over all molecules i inside the primitive cell , @xmath5 is the dielectric constant of the solvent , @xmath6 is the radius of the spherical surface , @xmath7 is the dipole moment of molecule @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the total dipole moment inside the spherical surface surrounding the molecule @xmath8 .",
    "the correct energetics in hydrogen - bonded systems and in systems undergoing proton transfer reactions is difficult to describe even with _",
    "ab initio _ methods .",
    "in particular , dft studies of weak hydrogen - bonding systems have proved to be particularly difficult and only limited success has been achieved in predicting the geometries and energies for reactant and transition state configurations on the potential energy surface using most exchange - correlation functionals @xcite .",
    "care should therefore be exercised when choosing a particular _ ab initio _ method to calculate proton transfer reaction rates .",
    "the non - local exchange - correlation schemes developed by proynov , vela and salahub @xcite have shown particular promise for the description of hydrogen - bonded systems .",
    "sirois et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that their kinetic - energy dependent exchange functionals ( blap and plap ) performed better than all gga options ( bp86 , pp86 , pw91 ) , blyp , or other hybrid methods ( b3lyp , b3pw91 ) on systems involving intra - molecular hydrogen bonds . the predictions for equilibrium and transition state geometries as well as the energetics was in agreement with high - quality post - hartree - fock calculations [ ccsd(t ) and g2]@xcite . specifically , for the gas - phase cyclic cluster of acetic acid and methanol in fig .",
    "1 , the activation energy using the plap exchange correlation functional was found to be approximately @xmath10 kcal / mol , in excellent agreement with the qcisd value of @xmath11 kcal / mol@xcite .    for the simulations described in the present work ,",
    "the energies of different configurations were carried out using a modified version of the lcgto - dft program demon - ks3.4 @xcite using the plap exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the dft electronic structure calculations were carried out as in reference [ ] , where the application of dft electronic structure methods to hydrogen - bonding systems is discussed in detail .",
    "a double-@xmath12 plus polarization ( dzvp ) orbital basis set was used for all atoms and the convergence level for the scf ( self - consistent field ) energy using the auxiliary fitting basis sets @xcite was @xmath13 kcal / mol .      in order to implement the qm / mm / continuum approach to compute reaction rates for the double proton transfer reaction in the acetic acid - methanol cluster solvated by tetrahydrofuran",
    ", a sufficiently accurate molecular mechanics description of the interaction between the solvent molecules is needed@xcite . in this work , the opls all atom ( opls - aa ) force field of jorgensen et al.@xcite with a modified electrostatic interaction term has been used to describe the interactions between thf solvent molecules .",
    "the modifications to the electrostatics were designed to improve the gas - phase distribution of the partial charges in a thf molecule as well as to improve the description of polarization effects in condensed phases .",
    "since the local electrostatic environment as well as long ranged polarization effects can influence the proton transfer process , it is important to properly account for the permanent and induced charges in the solvent . to describe all such electrostatic phenomena , all solvent molecules",
    "have been assigned permanent and induced charges .",
    "it can be demonstrated@xcite using second - order perturbation theory that the electrostatic interaction energy between two polarizable molecules @xmath14 and @xmath15 , each of which carries a set of atomic permanent and induced charges , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath18 corresponding to the charges on molecule @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are the site charges on molecule @xmath23 , respectively , can be written to a good approximation as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the distance between sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 on molecules @xmath19 and @xmath23 . in principle , the induced charge appearing on a given solvent molecule is dependent on its local environment .",
    "one simple way of incorporating solvent polarization effects is to assign each solvent molecule the same average induced charge in a `` mean - field '' fashion .",
    "more sophisticated methods of including polarization effects either assign site polarizabilities or use fluctuating charges distributed at specific locations on each solvent molecule@xcite . such methods when combined with _",
    "ab initio _ electronic structure methods either necessitate an iterative solution of the electronic structure and fluctuating charge distributions or involve dynamical methods in an extended lagrangian system@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , each of these approaches has shortcomings which make them impractical to implement in conjunction with importance sampling monte - carlo methods .    in principle",
    ", the iterative minimization of the kohn - sham and fluctuating charge functionals can be implemented within a monte - carlo sampling approach at the cost of additional computational effort .",
    "however , provided the solvent is not very polarizable , the variation of the induced charges on the solvent molecules from their mean due to the presence of the solute is expected to be small .",
    "for this reason , we have utilized fixed induced charges for all solvent molecules .",
    "this corresponds to computing ground state energies for the reactive core @xmath28 based on a kohn - sham functional@xcite @xmath29 $ ] which depends on the ground state electron distribution @xmath30 of the solute in the presence of the fixed permanent and induced external solvent charges . note that this functional includes the electrostatic energy of interaction between the quantum solute and the charges on the molecular - mechanical solvent molecules .    in general ,",
    "one complication must be considered when discussing electrostatic interactions in mixed qm / mm systems that arises from the fact that the quantum mechanical electron density can become over - polarized by the molecular mechanical point charges due to the absence of considerations of the fermi repulsion between quantum and molecular mechanical charges@xcite .",
    "such effects are particularly severe when using delocalized basis sets to represent the quantum subsystem , but are less significant when gaussian or other local basis sets are utilized . in the present work , the full coulomb interaction potential has been used to describe electrostatic interaction terms between the solute and the solvent charges without any screening modifications at short distances since all dft calculations for the quantum subsystem use localized basis sets .    in our study of the acetic acid - methanol system in a thf solution ,",
    "the permanent charges have been assigned the value @xmath31 , whereas the induced charges are set to a mean - field value of @xmath32 for all indices @xmath8 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the standard charges in the opls force field .",
    "it can be verified that the electrostatic interaction energy calculated using eq .",
    "( [ totalinteractionenergypermanentplusinducedtext ] ) with this set of permanent and average induced charges is precisely the electrostatic energy calculated using the standard set of fixed opls charges . on the other hand , by assigning a mean induced charge to each solvent molecule , the computed values for the gas - phase dipole moment and condensed phase dielectric constant are in better agreement with the corresponding experimental values ( see table 1 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that a less satisfactory means of describing electrostatic interactions between the solute and the solvent would consist of calculating the electrostatic interactions between the gas phase electron distribution with the solvent charges . in such a scenario ,",
    "the ground state electron distribution for the solute interacts with the solvent via a coulomb interaction of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gas - phase electron distribution and @xmath37 is defined to be the distance between the ith charge @xmath38 in the solvent and the point @xmath39 .",
    "this approximation corresponds to calculating the solute energy in the condensed phase by a zeroth order approximation for the electronic distribution of the solute , that is , @xmath40",
    "\\approx   f\\left [ \\rho _ { 0}(\\mathbf{x})\\right ] + v.\\ ] ] such a description neglects the fact that the ground state solute electron distribution is influenced by the presence of the solvent charges . the influence of the solvent charges on the ground state energy can be accounted for by incorporating a polarization energy of the solute by the solvent .",
    "although such a crude level of description of the electrostatic interactions may be incomplete , it is useful in developing importance sampling monte - carlo schemes based on guiding potentials , such as the molecular mechanics based importance function method ( mmbif ) described in the next section .",
    "the mmbif method@xcite consists of utilizing an auxiliary markov chain with a known asymptotic molecular mechanical distribution to propose trial configurations for an _ ab initio _ based monte carlo simulation . in the method ,",
    "each trial configuration is obtained as the last state in a classical markov chain generated from the current configuration in the _ ab initio _ simulation using various updating schemes .",
    "the proposed configurations are then accepted or rejected in the _ ab initio _",
    "chain according to the usual metropolis - hastings algorithm@xcite . if the previous and new trial configurations in the _ ab initio _",
    "mc chain are denoted by @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively , the proposed state is accepted with the probability @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is defined to be @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the potential energies of configuration @xmath48 calculated by _ ab initio _ methods ( here density functional theory , abbreviated dft ) and the classical potential , respectively , and @xmath49 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this acceptance criterion guarantees that the _ ab initio _ markov chain has the correct limiting boltzmann distribution@xcite , regardless of the number of classical updates used to generate the proposed configuration .",
    "the efficiency of the mmbif approach relies on constructing a molecular mechanics potential for the entire system which approximates the true interactions of the system at a qualitative level . at first glance",
    ", the construction of a molecular mechanics potential for a condensed phase system appears a daunting task given that the electron distribution of the solute changes considerably during the reactive process and is influenced in a complicated fashion by its local environment .",
    "however , it is relatively straightforward to construct a molecular mechanics potential based on simple approximate forms of the interaction potentials , such as that in eq .",
    "( [ interactionsolutesolventcorrect ] ) . for such forms of the potential ,",
    "the construction of the potential is reduced to modeling the reaction in gas phase and calculating effective charges on the gas - phase solute which mimic the correct electron distribution . the approximate form for the potential",
    "can be corrected for using importance sampling methods .",
    "for example , a monte - carlo chain of states generated using an approximate expression for the energy can be manipulated by re - weighting the configurations appearing in the chain by an appropriate factor@xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this approach is highly dependent on the quality of the approximation for the true energy of the system .",
    "one might anticipate that the crude of level of description of the electrostatic interactions in eq .",
    "( [ interactionsolutesolventcorrect ] ) which neglects any polarization effects of the solute by the solvent molecules would introduce large statistical uncertainties at the re - weighting step .",
    "however , the polarization of the solute by the solvent can be approximated by adjusting the charge of the solvent molecules in the expression for the interaction between the solute and the solvent . as will be discussed , the effective charge on the solvent molecules",
    "can be designed to approximate solute polarization effects and thereby improve the statistical resolution of the re - weighting procedure .",
    "the task of constructing a molecular mechanics potential for the gas - phase proton transfer reaction is facilitated by using bond evolution theory considerations .",
    "following these lines , the molecular mechanics description of the acetic acid - methanol complex in the absence of the solvent was created as suggested in reference [ .",
    "the total molecular mechanics energy was decomposed into two components .",
    "the first component of the total energy was written as a sum of harmonic potentials representing the variation of the potential with bond length , bond angle or bond dihedral displacements from their minimum energy values at a fixed value of the control parameter @xmath50 , defined by @xmath51 where the numbering of the atoms is that from fig .",
    "the second component of the total energy was written as a sum of four morse potentials depending on the four @xmath52 bond lengths , plus two effective potentials depending on two parameters , @xmath53 and @xmath54 defined as @xmath55 these effective potentials account for the flow of electronic charge during the reaction , as well as for the fermi repulsion between the oxygen atoms @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and between @xmath58 and @xmath57 .",
    "this second component of the total energy was implemented using the same functional forms as in reference [ . as in the case of the malonaldehyde study , no potential which depends explicitly on the angles @xmath59 or @xmath60",
    "was utilized , although some dependence on the angle @xmath61 was explicitly introduced using a functional form which interpolates between a harmonic potential for transition state values of the parameter @xmath50 , and zero for values of @xmath50 characteristic for the reactant or product configurations .",
    "the complete details for the construction of the guiding potential for the solute can be found in reference [ .",
    "the simplest practical means of incorporating the electrostatic interactions between the solute and the solvent molecules in the molecular mechanics potential is to fit partial charges to atomic sites in the solute to reproduce the gas - phase electronic distribution .",
    "however , since the electron distribution of the solute varies appreciably with the configuration of the solute , the guiding potential must incorporate solute charges which vary as the reaction proceeds . in their bond evolution theory analysis of the tautomerization of malonaldehyde ,",
    "krokidis et al.@xcite found that the total charge in the basins of attraction of the proton and oxygen atoms varies approximately linearly with a control parameter similar to the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , it can reasonably be assumed that most of the variation of the charges on atomic sites in the solute can be explained by a linear variation with @xmath50 .",
    "an alternative approach to incorporate the solute - solvent interactions can be constructed using simulated tempering methods@xcite .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that it does not rely on any approximation for the variation of the fitted charges on the solute during the reaction .",

    "however , if the error bars for the activation energy in the linearly - interpolated charge method is @xmath125 kcal / mol , they are roughly four times larger in the simulation using the parallel tempering algorithm for comparable cpu times .",
    "the optimal number of electrostatic indices in the simulated tempering approach was found to be @xmath129 . in the optimized",

    "first , the partition functions @xmath133 for the umbrella potential - biased ensemble from which the free energies were computed correspond to a particular value of the electrostatic fraction parameter @xmath85 .",
    "it should also be noted that although a difference in free energy between adjacent values of the electrostatic index of the order of @xmath116 seems to suggest a low probability of rejecting swaps between consecutive values of the index , the actual rejection rate was found to be significantly higher .",
    "the relatively large rejection rate is due to the fact that differences in free energy reflect the _ average _ energetic _ and _ entropic differences between thermodynamic states with different @xmath134 , whereas the acceptance probability in equation ( [ acceptancecriterion ] ) involves only the difference in the energies of the actual configurations to be swapped . in particular , it was observed that the enthalpic @xmath135 and entropic @xmath136 contributions to the gibbs free energy @xmath132 vary in opposite directions as the fraction of the solute charge @xmath137 increases from zero to one .",
    "these variations of enthalpic and entropic terms with the charge fraction can be visualized by comparing the results plotted in fig . 8 and fig .",
    "9 . from the two figures it appears that @xmath135 increases and @xmath136 decreases with @xmath137 .",
    "the opposite directions in which enthalpic and entropic terms vary with @xmath137 is reflected in the mobility of the state @xmath138 of the simulated tempering algorithm in the @xmath27 ( or @xmath137 ) subspace . turning our attention to equation ( [ acceptancecriterion ] ) , note that an increase of @xmath136 with @xmath137 suggests that for a large fraction of configurations ( i,*r * ) transitions in which @xmath27 is _ increased _",
    "are accepted only if the ratio @xmath139 is approximately unity , @xmath140 .",
    "such is the case for an important number of transitions from electrostatic index @xmath141 to electrostatic index @xmath142 , for example , for which an increase in @xmath137 is accompanied only by a small decrease and occasionally even an increase in energy . on the other hand , for a @xmath137 near unity",
    ", a decrease of @xmath135 with @xmath137 suggests that a large fraction of transitions in which @xmath27 is _ decreased _ are rejected unless @xmath143 .",
    "such is the case in a large number of transitions which are attempted from the final index @xmath144 to @xmath145 for example , which are accompanied by a significant increase in energy .",
    "the choice of the weights @xmath146 suggested in equation ( [ choicew ] ) represents a good compromise in the sense that transitions which increase and which decrease @xmath27 have an equal probability of being accepted on average .",
    "nevertheless , this analysis points to the fact that if one uses the simulated tempering approach for the study of chemical reactions in solution , one should try to avoid turning on the charges of the reactive core all the way from zero to their final values . as enthalpic and entropic terms",
    "will always vary in opposite directions during the charging process , the sampling could become quite inefficient , especially when studying reactions in which there is a difference in the net charge between reactants and transition states , and not just in their dipole moments as in the present case .",
    "however , this conclusion does not mean that the mmbif approach used in the simulation with linearly interpolated charges will always be more efficient than the simulated tempering method .",
    "the efficiency of the mmbif approach relies heavily on the appropriateness of the postulated variation of the charges in a reactive system with the reaction coordinate . in the present study , the approximation of the variation of the fitted kollman - singh charges with the solute configuration by a linear variation with the parameter @xmath50 in equation ( [ a_b_1andb_2definitions ] ) proved quite accurate .",
    "however , such a simple relation could break down , especially when studying reactions with a net transfer of charge . in this case",
    ", we suggest using an approach which combines the benefits of both methods illustrated in the present study : the use of a simulated tempering approach in which the solute charge is gradually modified from a linear variation with the reaction coordinate to their actual values obtained via the kollman - singh approach .",
    "in this article , two important issues on the applicability of the molecular mechanics based importance sampling method to the study of reactive events in condensed phase environments have been addressed .",
    "one major concern in developing a successful implementation of the mmbif approach is the ease of development of a sufficiently accurate molecular mechanics potential to guide the sampling . although a fully automated approach to generating guiding potentials for general reactions is still not available , it is encouraging to note that the use of the same principles of bond - evolution theory@xcite as in our earlier study of the malonaldehyde system@xcite were adequate for designing a molecular mechanics potential for the acetic acid - methanol system .",
    "this success is particularly impressive in light of the fact that the malonaldehyde and acetic acid - methanol systems differ substantially not only in their barrier heights ( by a factor of @xmath0 ) , but also in the qualitative nature of the chemical event ( one proton versus two protons transferred ) .",
    "it suggests that bond - evolution theory guidelines are likely to be practical in developing molecular mechanics potentials for other proton transfer reactions , and for possibly other types of chemical events .",
    "the study of the double proton transfer reaction between acetic acid and methanol in tetrahydrofuran also demonstrates that the mmbif method can be applied in reaction rate calculations of chemical transformations in solvents of medium polarity .",
    "in particular , an increase in the cpu time of factors of @xmath0 and @xmath147 with respect to gas - phase calculations were obtained using two different sampling methods .",
    "hence , we conclude that it should be possible in many instances to compute solvent mediated reaction rates with statistical accuracies comparable to those obtained in gas - phase calculations , even though the complexity of the calculation is increased enormously by the presence of the solvent .    it should be emphasized that the contribution of the solvent to the total activation energy in the present study is only on the order of a few factors of @xmath116 at room temperature . as a result ,",
    "the actual mechanism of the proton transfer event is virtually unchanged from the process in gas phase .",
    "this simplification allowed the separation of the reactive _ ab initio _ core and the solvent degrees of freedom into effectively disjoint sets which were updated in isolation in the parallel tempering implementation of the sampling .",
    "in many cases , the structure of the solvent plays a more substantial role in the reactive process . under such circumstances",
    ", care must be taken to devise methods in which the reactive core and the solvent structure are updated in a more correlated fashion .",
    "for example , for a reaction in a solvent with a larger dielectric constant , the simulated tempering approach can be implemented by incorporating simultaneous mmbif updates of the solute and solvent degrees of freedom at each electrostatic index .",
    "it is informative to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of using the mmbif method versus using present day molecular dynamics based methods for calculating reaction rates in solution using a hybrid qm / mm approach .",
    "the practical use of the simple molecular dynamics methods for sampling configurations of a system containing a reactive core which is described using _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods and the solvent molecules which are described using a molecular mechanics potential is limited by the fact that calculating the time - evolution of the system necessitates the computation of the time - consuming _ ab initio _ forces acting on the core atoms .",
    "these time - consuming calculations must be performed in traditional molecular dynamics calculations even when only the solvent degrees of freedom change significantly .",
    "several methods have been proposed for circumventing the inefficiency of the traditional qm / mm molecular dynamics calculations which are based on an `` artificial '' separation of time scales associated with the solute and solvent atoms@xcite .",
    "the central idea of these methods is to use a large mass in conjunction with a high temperature thermostat for the solute atoms , whereas the solvent atoms have usual masses and are in contact with a room temperature thermostat@xcite .",
    "the large mass of the core atoms is chosen in such a way that the solvent degrees of freedom relax on a time scale which is much smaller than the time scale of the massive core atoms .",
    "multiple - time scale arguments can be utilized to demonstrate that the integration of hamilton s equations describing the evolution of the solute plus solvent system can be performed by computing the forces acting on the solvent degrees of freedom significantly more often than the _ ab initio _ forces acting on the solute without altering the asymptotic boltzmann distribution of the configurations of the system .",
    "in addition , the decoupling between the solute and solvent time scales enables the use of a large temperature thermostat coupled to the solute atoms without introducing an irreversible heat flow , thereby ensuring that the average kinetic energy of the core atoms is comparable with the magnitude of the reaction barrier which separates reactant and product configurations on the potential energy surface .",
    "therefore , a relatively small number of _ ab initio _",
    "calculations must be performed before a reactive event occurs .",
    "both the mmbif and the modified molecular dynamics approach succinctly described above have a number of advantages and shortcomings when studying chemical reactions in solution which are essentially driven by fluctuations in the structure of the _ solute _ using a qm / mm approach . the main disadvantage of the mmbif method consists of the fact that a reasonable molecular mechanics description of the reactive event in the _ gas - phase _ solute is required , and this molecular mechanics potential must usually be created from scratch . nevertheless , once such molecular mechanics potential has been constructed , the cpu time necessary for calculating reaction rates in solution is essentially independent of the characteristics of the solvent such as its dielectric relaxation time .",
    "in contrast , the molecular dynamics approach does not necessitate prior information with respect to the potential energy surface of the cluster , although if such information exists , it can be used to improve the efficiency of the sampling@xcite .",
    "however , the average time needed to observe a reaction event increases as the square root of the effective mass of the reactive degree of freedom . on the other hand , given the requirement of the separation of time scales between the solvent and solute degrees of freedom , the characteristic time scale of the solute atom motion and therefore the lower bound for the value of the mass needed for the core atoms is _ determined _ by the duration of the solvent dielectric relaxation time .",
    "therefore , it appears that the efficiency of the above mentioned molecular dynamics scheme decreases with the increase in the solvent dielectric relaxation time .",
    "the methodology proposed in the present work can be combined with the ideas presented in reference [ to include nuclear quantum effects via centroid transition state theory with a supplementary increase in the cpu time by a factor of @xmath148 times the number of path - integral beads .",
    "such a combination of procedures provides a rigorous and practical platform for calculation of kinetic isotope effects . an important goal for future",
    "work is to clarify the mechanistic origin of the relation between the breakdown of the rule of geometric mean in multiple proton transfer reactions and tunneling effects .",
