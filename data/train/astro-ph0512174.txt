    "astronomical observation of submillimeter waves represents one of the last unexplored regions of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "one of the difficulties with performing observations in this band is owing to a large atmospheric absorption .",
    "since submillimeter waves are a boundary of the radio and infrared , there remain a lot of frontiers in the development of fundamental observational technology .",
    "radio interferometry and synthesis arrays , which are basically ensembles of two elements interferometers , are used to make measurements of fine angular resolution@xcite .",
    "interferometers have been used at millimeter waves@xcite and have been considered one of the best instruments at submillimeter wave@xcite . by setting two telescopes with separation larger than the maximum construct - able diameter of the single mirror , higher angular resolution than single dish system",
    "is easily achieved with aperture synthesis type interferometers . by combining many telescopes ,",
    "a large effective area can be attained to increase the sensitivity of the system .",
    "interferometers are robust against atmospheric fluctuations since large scale atmospheric fluctuations do not cause interference signals and are automatically omitted by the interferometers",
    ".    however , currently operating millimeter and submillimeter interferometers have the following two fundamental problems because they use heterodyne receivers as focal plane detectors : the receiving systems perform modulation and amplification of the source signal by mixing with a local oscillator signal .",
    "they can measure the phase of the incident electromagnetic wave . in the following discussion",
    ", the space - borne observation assumes as for an ideal case .",
    "the noise temperature of heterodyne receivers at frequency @xmath0 is written as @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 is the thermal planck function with @xmath3 due to the cosmic microwavebackground ( cmb ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are planck constant and boltzmann constant , respectively , and @xmath6 represents the detection efficiencies .",
    "the first term represents the photon noise due to statistical fluctuation of the cmb intensity .",
    "the second term represents the quantum limit of the heterodyne receivers which comes from the uncertainty principle between the phase and the number of photons@xcite .",
    "this equation shows that the noise temperature is limited by the quantum limit and is increased linearly with the frequency in the frequency range of @xmath7  ghz .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity of heterodyne - based interferometers is severely limited by the quantum limit of the receivers .",
    "another problem is the severely limited field - of - view ( fov ) of the interferometers , due to the difficulty of constructing a large format detector array of heterodyne receivers @xcite .",
    "in addition , the possible bandwidth of the interferometer is also limited by a bandwidth of intermediate frequency(if ) amplifier , since the phase change of the modulated signal after mixing with a local oscillator signal must be followed .",
    "on the other hand , direct detectors such as bolometer are also used in millimeter and submillimeter systems except for interferometers .",
    "direct detectors measure the intensity of the source signal .",
    "they can not measure the phase of the incident electromagnetic wave .",
    "therefore , they have not been used as focal plane detectors for interferometers .",
    "the quantum limit of a direct detector is the minimum detectable power when any internal noise can be neglected , the quantum limit of a direct detector is expressed in noise temperature as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the response time of the detector , which is about @xmath11  msec in the case of bolometer , and the bandwidth of the detector , which is about @xmath12  ghz@xcite .",
    "the noise temperature of direct detectors at frequency @xmath0 is written as @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the scecond term is negligible compared with the cmb photon noise at millimeter and submillimeter waves",
    ". therefore , noise temperature of direct detectors are much lower than heterodyne receivers in the frequency range of @xmath7  ghz .",
    "actually , the noise power of the most sensitive currently operating bolometers is already lower than the quantum limit of the heterodyne in the frequency range of @xmath14  ghz .",
    "in contrast to the heterodyne , a large format millimeter and submillimeter direct detector array is possible to construct@xcite .",
    "there is essentially no limit on the bandwidth for direct detectors@xcite .",
    "the above discussion indicates that the bolometric interferometer , which is able to use a direct detector as a focal plane detector for the interferometer , could be one of the best ideal instruments for millimeter and submillimeter astronomy since it shares the advantages of both direct detectors and interferometer .",
    "since direct detectors can not obtain the information of the phase of electromagnetic waves , two beams captured by two apertures must be mixed before guided into the detectors .",
    "there are two ways to mix beams .",
    "one is called fizeau type beam mixing .",
    "the simplest example of this method is that two beams obtained by masking a single telescope are mixed at the focus of the telescope .",
    "images of different portions of the sky are focused on different positions of the focal plane .",
    "therefore , the extension of the fov by using the focal plane detector array is straightforward in this case .",
    "however , there is a fundamental problem in applying this method to millimeter and submillimeter observations .",
    "we have to use many detector pixels within a single fov to resolve the fringe pattern inside of the fov .",
    "since the direct detector arrays in millimeter and submillimeter wave bands are still expensive , the cost performance of applying this method to this waveband is poor .",
    "the other method is called the michelson - type beam mixing .",
    "an application of the fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) to aperture synthesis interferometry has been studied as a possible solution of the michelson - type beam mixing bolometric interferometer .",
    "the application was first independently proposed by itoh & ohtsuka(1986)@xcite and mariotti & ridway ( 1988)@xcite in near infrared ( nir ) .",
    "the system was referred by these authors as ",
    "double fourier interferometry  , since the signal obtained by the system is a fourier transformation of both spectra and intensity distribution on the sky .",
    "itoh & ohtsuka studied single pupil interferometry .",
    "mariotti & ridway studied multi - pupil interferometry for high spatial resolution .",
    "as explained in this paper , the extension of the fov by putting the focal plane detector array is not straightforward , but it is possible with some restrictions .",
    "rinehart et al .",
    "( 2004)@xcite have been studying the extension of the fov by putting a detector array on the focal plane of the double fourier in laboratory experiments in an optical wave bands by using optical ccd camera .",
    "they refer to this experiment as the wide - field imaging interferometry testbed .    in this paper",
    ", we propose the application of a martin & puplett - type fourier transform spectrometer ( martin & puplett(1969)@xcite , hereafter mp - ft ) to the aperture synthesis system in millimeter and submillimeter waves(ohta(2004)@xcite ) .",
    "a wire grid polarizer ( wg ) is used as a beam splitter in this system .",
    "so , the wavelength dependence of reflectivity of wg is small and is suitable for a wide band measurement system . by setting the two input wgs appropriately , 2d intensity distribution of four stokes parameters can be measured .",
    "the signal obtained by our system is a fourier transformation of spectra and intensity distributions of four stokes parameters ( multiple components ) on the sky .",
    "therefore , we refer to this system as a multi - fourier transform interferometer , abbreviated to muft .",
    "the abbreviation also contains the meaning that this instrument measures mutual correlation of the source signal instead of auto - correlation as in the case of usual fts .",

    "precise source intensity distribution is obtained .",

    "the sparseness of the sampled points , convolution with a window function which is set at zero at the baseline vector points where the observation was not performed , must be taken into account in this calculation .",
    "secondly , the source spectrum may not be finite for all frequencies .",
    "the source intensity may be zero in some frequency ranges due to absorption by the intervening medium or no emission from the source .",
    "division by @xmath75 described in eq .",
    "( 10 ) will diverge in these frequency ranges .",
    "the data for these frequency ranges should be removed in the procedure .",
    "otherwise , they may introduce a large amount of noise into the obtained map .",
    "these modifications result in an imperfect map .",
    "however , it does not mean that the intrinsic power of the large dynamic range advantage is lost .",
    "the imperfection of the synthesized map due to the imperfect @xmath89 coverage is one of the most common problems in interferometer .",
    "the large dynamic range advantage of muft can be explained as a large @xmath89 coverage being obtained from a small number of baseline vector combinations .",
    "this technique is essentially the same as the multi - frequency synthesis ( mfs ) used in radio interferometers ( conway et al.(1990)@xcite ) .",
    "the situation to which this procedure is applicable is a very special case .",
    "however , there are plenty of astronomically important objects whose spatial distribution is independent on frequency , such as millimeter and submillimeter wave intensity distribution of clusters of galaxies known as sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( hereafter sz effect , sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1972)@xcite , hattori & okabe(2005)@xcite ) .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the essential reason why muft is capable of performing imaging observations in broadband is that the complex visibility function of the source can be extracted from the observables with muft .",
    "this is accomplished by changing the time lag from @xmath45 to @xmath46 symmetrically .",
    "the reason why the complex visibility function is measurable by this process , is physically explained as follows .",
    "consider a broadband point source observation by muft .",
    "suppose that there is a geometrical time lag , @xmath90 , caused by the light path length difference from the source to each aperture @xmath20 and @xmath21 , that is @xmath91 .",
    "a burst - like interference signal is observed as scanning in @xmath27 by changing @xmath47 continuously at @xmath92 , where the geometrical time lag is compensated by the internal time lag . since this burst - like",
    "signal always appears at @xmath93 in the fts , the signal appearing at @xmath93 is called a central burst of the interferogram .",
    "we also refer to this burst - like signal observed for a point source in muft to a central burst as following the fts . in the case of muft , the burst center appears at the position where the total time lag of the light led by each aperture is zero .",
    "the position of the central burst observed by muft contains information about the position of the point source in the sky .",
    "if the source position is slightly shifted from the origin of the source plane toward the same side of the aperture @xmath20 and @xmath90 is negative , then @xmath27 must be positive and vice versa to observe the central burst signature .",
    "suppose that @xmath27 is only scanned in the positive range .",
    "the central burst of the second source is not observable by this scan and we can not know the position of the second source . by rotating the baseline vector by 180 degrees",
    "if possible , the geometrical time lag for the second source becomes negative and the central burst caused by the second source becomes observable by the positive @xmath27 scan . on the other hand , the central burst of the first source goes out of the positive @xmath27 region .",
    "this rotation corresponds to take a @xmath94 configuration of two apertures .",
    "therefore , when @xmath27 is scanned only in the positive range , to obtain a full source image , measurements with @xmath44 and @xmath94 configurations are required .",
    "however , if we allow for scanning of the negative @xmath27 region , the central burst of the second source can be detected in the negative @xmath27 region without rotating the baseline vector .",
    "therefore , by performing a scan in @xmath27 from the negative to the positive range symmetrically , the full source image is measurable without a performing 180-degree rotation of the baseline vector .",
    "this is why the symmetrical scan in @xmath27 leads us to obtain the complex visibility function .",
    "in contrast to the muft , the complex visibility function is obtained in the following ways in the heterodyne system : the real part of the complex visibility function is obtained by directly correlating the signals obtained by each aperture .",
    "the imaginary part is obtained by correlating the signals after applying the @xmath95 phase shifter for one of the signals .",

    ", the parts depicted are the light collecting unit(lic ) , the fourier interference unit(fi ) and the detection & sampling unit(des ) .",
    "the detected signal is transfered to a computer after it has been through an electrical amplifier , a noise filter and an ad converter .",
    "the sampled data are analyzed by a data analysis system .",
    "since the data is transformed into polarimetry , spectroscopy and imaging information in the data analysis system , the data analysis system is referred to as psi .",
    "the lic first part performs a division of the wave front of the incident source signal , and guides the signal to the fourier interference unit .",
    "two different types are considered .",
    "one type has multi - apertures installed on separated multi - platforms .",
    "the antenna in multi - platforms type radio interferometer and siderostat in multi - platforms type optical - ir interferometer correspond to this type . in this type",
    ", there are large geometrical time lags except for the moment when the source is at southing . to compensate for the geometrical time lags which are also time - variable due to earth rotation , a large and time - variable offset in the scanning center of @xmath27",
    "must be introduced in muft . to do this",
    ", a fringe tracking delay - line technique can be applied@xcite . when the muft system is applied to multi - platforms type lic , performing a symmetrical scan in @xmath27 from the negative to the positive region is essential to obtain the complex visibility function .",
    "this is because the possible rotation angle of the baseline vector relative to the astronomical sources is limited , since the sources set and are not observable for nearly half a day except for sources around a celestial pole .",
    "the other type of lic has that multi - apertures are installed on a single platform . for simplicity , we consider the two - aperture case",
    ". the positions of the two telescopes are controlled by controlling the azimuth and elevation angles of the platform so that a fixed reference point on the targeted source is maintained by a baseline vector bisector line , perpendicular to the baseline vector .",
    "the same reference point must be kept in the center of the fov of each telescope .",
    "examples of this type of lic are cbi@xcite and amiba@xcite which have multi apertures installed on a single platform .",
    "two mirrors connected by one rail mounted on a turntable , such as spirit ( mather & leisawitz(2000)@xcite ) , could be a solution . in the space ,",
    "using multi - satellites could be an attractive solution .",
    "the fourier interference unit is an instrument in which divided light beams are recombined after modulating one of the light path lengths to make an internal time lag and is the heart of the muft system .",
    "the method of beam mixing is the michelson type , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "this is designed by applying the mp - ft to aperture synthesis .",
    "it has two entrance windows to receive two light beams guided from the light collecting unit .",
    "wire grid polarizers are used as beam splitters and beam combiners .",
    "one example of the fi unit is shown in fig.[fig : fi ] .",
    "the direction of the wgs 1 and 2 wires must be set in the following ways .",
    "consider light rays which enter the wgs 1 and 2 along the vertical axis .",
    "these rays are reflected by the wgs and travel toward the roof top mirrors ( rtm ) along a horizontal axis , and are then reflected by rtms and travel back toward the wgs 1 and 2 .",
    "consider the projection of the wgs 1 and 2 on the planes normal to these light rays .",
    "the wires of these wgs must be tilted 45 degrees from the vertical axis on these planes .",
    "there are two possibilities for the wires being tilted clockwise ( cw ) or counter clockwise ( ccw ) from the vertical axis .",
    "there are four combinations for the alignment of the wgs 1 and 2 .",
    "two basic configurations of the wgs are illustrated in fig.[fig : op1 ] .",
    "when the wires of both wgs are set in a cw direction , stokes parameters of @xmath96 and @xmath97 are observable .",
    "this is referred to as option 1 . by setting both wgs to ccw",
    ", complementary data for the first case is obtained .",
    "one of the configurations gives @xmath98 and the other gives @xmath99 .",
    "when the wires of wg 1 are set cw and those of wg 2 are set ccw direction , stokes parameters of @xmath100 and @xmath101 are observable .",
    "this is referred to as option 2 . by changing the setting of wgs 1 and 2 vice versa , complementary data for the original combination",
    "are obtained .",
    "one of the configurations gives @xmath102 and the other gives @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , by performing observations with all four combinations , spectrally resolved source intensity distributions of 4 stokes parameters are obtained . since only three of 4 stokes parameters are independent for completely polarized waves , systematic errors could be self calibrated in muft by measuring all 4 stokes parameters for the completely polarized light beams . for the intensity measurement , observations with option 1",
    "is enough .",
    "details are explained in the next subsection .",
    "the other wgs installed in the fi unit for each option must be aligned in the following ways : in option 1 , the wires of bs wg must be directed vertically or horizontally as illustrated in fig.[fig : fi ] to combine the two beams taken by wgs 1 and 2 at bs .",
    "the combined beam , either reflected or transmitted by bs , is led to wgs a or b. to get interference terms of the two beams , the wires of output wgs a and b must be tilted 45 degrees from the vertical axis on the projected plane normal to the transmission axis . in option 2 , the wires of bs wg projected on the same plane as the projection plane for wg 2 must be perpendicular to those of wg 2 . then , the beam taken by wg 1 is transmitted and the beam taken by wg 2 is reflected by bs wg , and those are led to output wg a. the wire of output wg a must be vertical or horizontal to get interference terms of the two beams .    to extract the maximum ability of muft , direct detectors like a bolometer , which performs broadband intensity measurement , must be mounted on the des unit .",
    "one of two bolometers detects transmitted signals through the output wg , while the other detects reflected signals .",
    "the difference in reflected and transmitted signals reproduces the full mutual coherence function since the phase difference in the interferograms between two signals is @xmath104 .",
    "also , unwanted dc components are removed by this process .",
    "the dc fluctuations originating in the atmospheric fluctuation and the thermal fluctuation of the detector systems is mostly common to the transmitted and reflected components .",
    "therefore , these fluctuations are supposed to be removed by taking the difference of each signal . this technique is also applicable to mp - ft .",

    "baseline length vector source tracking and monitoring , mirror control , wg control and data acquisition are performed .",

    "detecting a signal traveling toward wg b would give an efficiency of 1/2 .",
    "furthermore , setting another muft under the first one to detect the radiation transmitted through wgs 1 and 2 would give an efficiency of 1 .",
    "sources of noise in observed interferograms are atmospheric radiation , radiation from optical components , internal detector noise and other excess noise such as readout electronics noise",
    ". since most of these noises are incoherent , they do not create coherent peaks in an interferogram but appear as random noise .",
    "common amplitude fluctuation of atmospheric emission could be removed by taking the difference of the interferograms obtained by signals transmitted through and reflected by output wg .",
    "radiation from optical components causes a small amount of coherent noise signal in an interferogram .",
    "most of the noise emission from the optical components which propagate back to the input wire grids is ejected to the sky .",
    "however , the direction of noise emission propagated from optical components has a finite distribution , and finite errors in alignment of wire grids and optical components are not escapable .",
    "therefore , a small amount of radiation returns to the detector .",
    "this results in an autocorrelation noise emission signal from the optical components in the interferogram .",
    "this can be removed by subtracting the background interferogram obtained by observations of the sky without source .",
    "however , it is impossible to observe exactly the same sky as during source observations without the source .",
    "we have to adopt data obtained by observations of the sky without the source as the background data .",
    "one of the most prominent advantage of muft is that one can use direct detectors like a bolometer as an interferometer focal plane detector .",
    "this give muft the following three significant advantages .",
    "[ [ high - sensitivity - and - wide - bandwidth - interferometer - in - fir ] ] high sensitivity and wide bandwidth interferometer in fir + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as described in the introduction , the sensitivity of direct detectors is higher than that of heterodyne receivers in the frequency range of @xmath14  ghz , that is @xmath138  mm . therefore , the sensitivity of muft could be higher than an interferometer based on heterodyne receivers , especially in submillimeter and fir wave bands . performing wide band observations with direct detectors",
    "is easily achieved .",
    "for example , bolometers which have a sensitivity in extremely broadband have been used as focal plane detectors of fts in fir wave bands .",
    "since the wgs have uniform reflectivity and transmissivity for all frequencies in millimeter , submillimeter and fir , the muft is suited to broadband observations .",
    "[ [ wide - field - of - view ] ] wide field of view + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    constructing large format heterodyne focal plane arrays is not yet feasible , since local oscillators and associated electrical circuits for each detector are bulky and not amenable to automated production using integrated circuit technology .",

    "this severely limits the fov of the interferometer . on the other hand , large format",
    "focal plane arrays of direct detectors are already operating .",
    "new types of direct detectors aiming at a dramatic increase in the number of pixels are lying developed@xcite . since muft",
    "can use direct detectors as interferometer focal plane detectors , it could extend the fov of the millimeter and submillimeter interferometers dramatically .",

    "long wavelengths observe overall source structures with low spatial resolution .",
    "short wavelengths observe fine structures with high spatial resolution .",
    "a large dynamic range of spatial resolution is covered even by a single baseline observation .",
    "a similar technique has been addressed as mfs for heterodyne interferometer(conway et al.(1990)@xcite ) .",

    "optical designs of muft for using detector arrays is going to be advanced .    applying this technique to a space - borne mission",
