    "in the total photoabsorption cross section on the proton above 400 mev the two pion production becomes possible , as it is clearly shown by several data sets from bubble chamber real photon experiments @xcite , as well as from exclusive electron scattering experiments @xcite and recent measurements with real photon beams with the daphne @xcite and saphir@xcite detectors . from the data",
    "one can see that the cross section for this process shows a steep rise at photon energies above threshold and then exhibits a smooth decrease , although still representing a large fraction of the total hadron photoproduction at @xmath2 gev .",
    "it is well established @xcite that a large contribution to this process is given by the intermediate formation of @xmath3(1236 ) , @xmath4(770 ) and their subsequent decay in the cascade processes @xmath5\\ ] ] @xmath6 where indices @xmath7 stand for real and virtual photons .    an important role in quasi two - body reactions ( 1),(2 )",
    "is played by nucleon resonances , whose excitation is clearly seen in the total photohadronic cross section @xcite as well as in exclusive channels like single pion photoproduction @xcite .",
    "many of such nucleon resonances have an appreciable branching ratio in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels ( see table i ) and for @xmath1 heavier than 1.7 gev multipion decay channels become dominant . therefore reactions ( 1),(2 ) offer a promising opportunity to study the structure of high lying resonances composed by light @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks .",
    "moreover , quark model calculations based on the three constituent quark picture @xcite predict more states than those found in experimental searches@xcite .",
    "some parameters for such `` missing '' states are shown in table ii : many of them are expected to have a strong branching ratio in the two - pion final state and weak or absent coupling to the single pion : this could be a reason for them having escaped detection in experiments with pion beams and in single pion photoproduction .",
    "an additional prediction for these unobserved states is that some of them could have sizeable electromagnetic couplings , similar to other states observed in electromagnetic production .",
    "therefore , sizeable electromagnetic couplings and strong decays through @xmath8 or @xmath9 channels could make poorly known states more visible as well as make some of the `` missing '' states appear in measurements of photo- or electroproduction of the two - pion final states .",
    "it is the aim of a wide experimental program at new facilities like tjnaf @xcite to investigate @xmath1 structure and to perform a search for missing states by measuring the multipion production exclusive channels produced via electromagnetic interaction . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the particular two - pion production channel that proceeds through the @xmath12 intermediate state .",
    "an important feature in the study of resonances in reactions ( 1),(2 ) is the strong contribution from non - resonant processes @xcite , creating a `` continuum '' in which resonant states are embedded .",
    "for this reason , common methods for resonance investigation such as multipole amplitude analysis @xcite , which essentially use resonance dominance , may be not very effective for reactions ( 1),(2 ) .",
    "different approaches to describe double pion photoproduction have been presented in a few papers@xcite , where models based on a variety of tree - level diagrams and a few baryon resonances have been used to calculate the two pion production .",
    "the limited number of resonances included however makes them applicable only for w lower than about 1.6 gev ; moreover non - resonant terms are not always corrected for unitarity absorption effects : actually , a very important problem in the investigation of @xmath1 in exclusive meson production by photons is the description of non - resonant processes at @xmath13 gev , where many competitive channels open up and coupled channel calculations@xcite appear to be very difficult due to restricted knowledge of hadron couplings as well as to computational problems .    a phenomenological description of the interaction with open inelastic channels in the initial and final states ( isi and fsi ) has been proposed first in @xcite . in this approach particle absorption in the initial and final states accounts for the complexity of interactions with inelastic channels ;",
    "the absorptive coefficients have been usually obtained@xcite assuming a diffractive character of the interaction of ingoing and outgoing particles ; this assumption could be justified at w values above @xmath1 excitation region , while at @xmath14 gev other mechanisms like especially s - channel processes should contribute in isi and fsi significantly . moreover , the high value of the effective coupling coefficients , close to the physical limit , adopted in @xcite , at relatively small @xmath15 gev looks somewhat artificial and not physically justified .",
    "the need to develop a method for @xmath1 electromagnetic form factor investigation from the experimental two - pion photo- and electroproduction data led us to the development of a phenomenological approach based on minimal model ingredients .",
    "this was accomplished parametrizing , under simple assumptions , the main two - pion photo- and electroproduction mechanisms and using experimental data to determine the corresponding parameters .",
    "this paper is our first step in establishing such phenomenological approach : we focused our attention on the particular quasi - two - body channel ( 1 ) and set up a simple model including all known resonant states contributing to this reaction and non - resonant processes starting from a minimal set of mechanisms proposed in @xcite .",
    "we used existing data for the pion electromagnetic form factor to provide a description of non - resonant terms for @xmath16 , as well as data about the strong form factor in @xmath17 vertex to take into account the particle size in hadronic vertices .",
    "unitarity effects manifesting in the competition of many hadronic channels in non - resonant processes were taken into account effectively , implementing initial and final state interactions ( isi and fsi ) , in form of absorptive corrections ; a new feature of our approach is that we developed a specific parametrisation of isi and fsi mechanisms responsible for channel coupling at w @xmath18 gev , based on experimental information about hadronic scattering amplitudes in this energy region . in this regard , we examined some aspects of the @xmath1 electromagnetic vertex dressing as related to our implementation of higher order corrections in form of isi and fsi .",
    "we studied also the transition to the higher energy region , w @xmath19 2 gev , where the pure tree - level scheme corrected for finite size ( strong form factor ) and unitarity effects ( isi - fsi ) fails in reproducing the experimental cross section : we found that a regge trajectory exchange , in the particular form recently proposed@xcite , can be a valid continuation into the higher energy region .",
    "our model relates @xmath1 electromagnetic helicity couplings @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and measured cross sections for reaction ( 1 ) induced both by real and virtual photons , therefore offering a way to attempt the measurement of @xmath1 contributions from a comparison to experimental data or a fit .",
    "the helicity representation has been chosen to describe the amplitudes for reaction ( 1 ) .",
    "the differential cross section for reaction ( 1 ) induced by real or virtual photons in the one - photon exchange approximation can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath23 \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{2}}\\frac{p_{\\pi}^{*}}{4w}\\ ] ] @xmath24 where @xmath25 is cm total energy , @xmath26 is the pion three momentum modulus in the cm frame , @xmath27 is the `` equivalent '' photon energy , @xmath28 is the nucleon mass , @xmath29 = - @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the real - virtual photon four - momentum , @xmath32 is the photon polarization parameter , @xmath33 is the leptonic tensor well - known from qed@xcite . the information about hadronic production is contained in the hadronic tensor @xmath34 which is a bilinear combination of hadronic currents : @xmath35 related to the helicity amplitudes @xmath36 according to : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are helicities of @xmath3 , proton and photon , respectively , @xmath41 is the four  vector associated to the photon polarization state @xmath40 and all variables are evaluated in the reaction cm frame .    being the @xmath3 an unstable particle , it is necessary to fold ( 3 ) on its mass distribution as follows@xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the squared running invariant mass of @xmath3 , while @xmath44 , @xmath45 are @xmath3 mass and width , respectively .",
    "the mechanisms of reaction ( 1 ) were described by a minimal set of feynman tree - level diagrams presented in fig .",
    "1 . these diagrams can be subdivided into @xmath1 contributions ( fig.1a ) and a group of non - resonant processes , or born terms ( fig.1b - e ) .",
    "the resonant part ( fig.1a ) involves all relevant @xmath1 and @xmath46 excitations in s - channel .",
    "the non - resonant amplitudes correspond to the same set of mechanisms considered in @xcite .",
    "new features of our approach in this respect are :    1 .   implementation of electromagnetic vertex functions to describe the behaviour of non - resonant amplitudes at @xmath16 and 2 .",
    "implementation of a strong @xmath47 form factor , relativistically invariant and based on the @xmath48 scattering analysis , to take into account the finite size of hadrons involved in non - resonant mechanisms .",
    "the non - resonant processes are composed by the `` seagull '' or `` contact '' term ( fig .",
    "1b ) ( which also naturally arises when considering the @xmath17 vertex as described by an effective meson - baryon lagrangian and then introducing the interaction with the electromagnetic field by the minimal coupling prescription ) , the t - channel pion - in - flight diagram ( fig.1c ) , the u - channel delta - in - flight diagram ( fig.1e ) and by the s - pole nucleon term ( fig.1d)@xcite . to treat photon , pion and delta off - shell we introduced form factors in the corresponding vertices .",
    "therefore born terms ( fig.1b - e ) are functions of @xmath29 and mandelstam t variables . for the vertex function evaluation we used a compilation of experimental data about electromagnetic and strong form factors @xcite",

    "analysis in @xcite yielded @xmath69 @xmath50 and we used this value in calculations . however considering uncertainties in @xcite as well as other data about pion electromagnetic form factor @xcite",
    ", we could allow for a variation of @xmath70 cut - off parameter within @xmath71 gev@xmath72 . concerning the @xmath47 t - dependence , we introduce as vertex function a strong form factor successfully applied in @xmath73 relativistic transition potentials@xcite @xmath74 the interaction constant @xmath75 and cut - off parameter @xmath76 are : @xmath77 and @xmath78 gev@xcite .",
    "we found that best data reproduction corresponds to @xmath79 gev .",
    "gauge invariance implies equality of the `` seagull '' term coupling @xmath59 and the pion - in - flight term coupling @xmath80 ; we stress that , instead of applying specific electromagnetic and strong vertex functions to the contact term ( which would imply to introduce some free parameters to be fitted ) , we rather fixed the @xmath81 of them @xmath59 requiring gauge invariance .    the s - channel nucleon contribution ( diagram of fig.1d )",

    ", it was derived from gauge invariance of the total born amplitude : @xmath91 second , we used function ( 11 ) for @xmath47 vertex , substituting mass @xmath62 by @xmath92 . in the latter choice we found the @xmath3-in - flight contribution to be negligible , because according to @xcite @xmath76 cut - off parameter does not exceed 1.3 gev .",
    "of course in the second evaluation of @xmath3-in - flight term gauge invariance of the total born amplitude is lost but , considering that our description of non - resonant terms aims to be phenomenological , we can assume that gauge invariance could be restored by other mechanisms not contributing significantly to the cross section .",
    "moreover , a negligible @xmath3-in - flight contribution seems to be supported by the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the tree - level calculation is not able to reproduce the data extracted from experimental analysis of @xmath0 production .",
    "one reason is that the lowest order mechanisms for reaction ( 1 ) do not incorporate unitarity and hence interaction with other open channels in initial and final states must be taken into account .",
    "direct description of the unitarity effects in the initial and final states would require a simultaneous treatment of all relevant hadronic channels in a coupled channel calculation using hadronic elastic and inelastic scattering amplitudes data .",
    "the present status of the hadronic amplitudes knowledge as well as computational capabilities restrict coupled channel calculations to w lower than 1.6 gev@xcite , while investigation of the cross section for process ( 1 ) above 1.6 gev is very important for @xmath1 physics .",
    "the description of open channels competition in non - resonance processes remains a challenging open problem of @xmath1 structure investigation in exclusive meson photo- and electroproduction .",
    "the modern status of strong interaction theory does not allow to evaluate hadronic amplitudes and couplings from fundamental principles ( i.e. qcd lagrangian ) .",
    "therefore we chose to adopt an effective treatment of unitarity effects in initial and final state ; the initial and final state interactions responsible for the modification of the amplitude for reaction ( 1 ) are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "2 . in the spirit of vector meson dominance ( vdm)@xcite ,",
    "the isi was assumed to proceed through a transition between photon and vector meson @xmath93 .",
    "the black blobs describe all transition processes , between @xmath94 initial and @xmath95 intermediate states as well as between @xmath96 intermediate and @xmath97 final states .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , a new feature of our approach is that , instead of using a diffractive ansatz like in the previous literature@xcite , better suited for higher energies , t - matrix elements for @xmath0 and @xmath94 elastic scattering were more appropriately evaluated using data about hadronic scattering in the resonance region , as briefly described in the following paragraphs .",

    "summation in ( 21 ) is performed over all @xmath1 contributing to the partial wave of total angular momentum @xmath101 and presented in table iii ; @xmath132 , @xmath133 are decomposition coefficients of @xmath125 and @xmath126 @xmath1 decay amplitudes through the states of total angular momentum j and related with @xmath1 partial decay widths in helicity representation @xmath134 and @xmath135 according to ( 31 ) .",
    "partial decay widths were taken from analysis @xcite and transformed from ls to helicity representation .",
    "our approach should be somewhat modified if dressed @xmath136 electromagnetic vertices are used for the resonant part of reaction ( 1 ) amplitude ( sect 3.3 ) . indeed , in the complexity of transition mechanisms in isi & fsi shown in fig . 2 by black blobs , also the sequence of processes reported in fig . 4",
    "is effectively taken into account ; that clearly represents a dressing mechanism of the @xmath136 electromagnetic vertex .",
    "but for instance , @xmath1 electromagnetic helicity amplitudes @xmath20 , @xmath21 extracted from pion photoproduction data analysis@xcite are usually interpreted as corresponding to dressed @xmath136 verticies .",
    "therefore , a double counting problem can arise in this case , as dressing effects of the electromagnetic @xmath1 vertex can be sizeable , as discussed in @xcite . to avoid double counting ,",
    "one possibility is to exclude @xmath137 and @xmath138 mechanisms from isi & fsi . to work out a phenomenological prescription for such exclusion we considered the above mentioned schematical situation , where the complexity of @xmath115 and @xmath139 transition mechanisms is restricted to single @xmath1 excitation with only elastic scattering as open channel .",
    "unitarity for breit  wigner formula can be expressed as @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 are total and partial @xmath1 decay widths .",
    "for single @xmath1 with only elastic open channel @xmath143 where @xmath141 , @xmath144 are total and elastic @xmath1 decay width ; our assumption insures that all transition mechanisms in @xmath115 , @xmath139 are represented by @xmath137 and @xmath138 processes ; therefore exclusion of @xmath1 excitation from isi & fsi should lead to complete absorption of ingoing and outgoing particle or to zero values for @xmath108 , @xmath109 penetration factors .",
    "as it follows from ( 19 ) the substitution @xmath145 would correspond to vanishing @xmath108 , @xmath109 coefficients and , therefore , could be considered as an empirical prescription for excluding @xmath137 and @xmath138 mechanisms from isi & fsi treatment .",
    "the complete absorption of born term amplitudes takes place only for such schematical situation ( single @xmath1 excitation with only elastic open channel ) on which we based our exclusion prescription .",
    "in actual situation prescription ( 24 ) gives only partial absorption of ingoing and outgoing particles , since @xmath1 contributing to @xmath97 and @xmath94 elastic scattering have many open decay channels , while relations ( 21 ) ",
    "( 24 ) give zero @xmath108 , @xmath109 coefficients only in our schematic assumption .",
    "inelasticities ( @xmath146 ) provide instead non - zero @xmath108 , @xmath109 coefficients even at resonant point ; @xmath1 off - shell excitations as well as non - resonant processes also give non - zero values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 coefficients .",
    "we assumed that this partial absorption of born terms can represent isi & fsi corrections , being the contribution from @xmath137 and @xmath138 mechanisms excluded .",
    "of course our exclusion procedure ( substitution ( 24 ) ) should be applied only if for the resonant part of reaction ( 1 ) dressed electromagnetic @xmath136 vertices are used .",
    "actually , @xmath136 vertices calculated in quark models are generally assumed to be `` bare '' , i.e. free from higher order corrections ( see for instance @xcite ) : in this case our calculation should not be affected by any double counting and therefore no exclusion procedure is necessary .",
    "the information on @xmath1 electromagnetic form factors from the measured cross section could be extracted both with and without application of exclusion procedure : in the first case we would obtain information about dressed @xmath136 vertices ; in the second about @xmath136 vertices without contribution from higher order corrections depicted in fig .",
    "therefore our approach provides the flexibility of choosing one procedure or the other .",
    "evaluation of non - resonant part of @xmath97 and @xmath94 scattering amplitude is described in more detail in @xcite , but we want to report here the main features of our evaluation .",
    "we used data@xcite on partial - wave @xmath147 elastic cross - sections with definite total angular momentum and isospin ; the amplitudes for these partial waves were described by a superposition of all relevant @xmath1 ( table 3 ) and a particular background for each orbital momentum l and total spin s. the resonant part of @xmath147 elastic scattering amplitudes was treated in the same manner as @xmath148 and @xmath94 elastic scattering processes ; data@xcite were used for @xmath149 couplings .",

    "the fit results for @xmath147 partial elastic scattering cross  section are shown in fig .",
    "dotted curves represent resonant contributions , dashed lines are background contributions , while solid lines correspond to complete amplitudes . as follows from fig . 5 , in @xmath1 excitation region nucleon resonances provide the main contribution in @xmath147 elastic amplitudes , therefore also in penetration coefficients ( 17 ) .",
    "this contribution was completely neglected in previous evaluations @xcite .",
    "hence , implementation of s  channel @xmath1 excitation amplitude performed in our approach is particularly important for isi & fsi treatment in @xmath1 excitation region .",
    "for w above 2.0 gev the contribution of resonant part in @xmath147 elastic scattering partial waves ( fig .",
    "5 ) falls down drastically and non  resonant processes provide the main contribution for most partial waves .",
    "therefore a diffractive approximation for isi and fsi absorptive corrections @xcite could be justified above @xmath1 excitation region .    to check the reliability of our approach to evaluate isi and fsi absorptive factors , we also performed calculations of such effects implementing @xmath0 and @xmath94 elastic scattering amplitudes directly provided by the authors of analysis @xcite , based on a global unitary fit of @xmath147 scattering t - matrix .",
    "the gross features of isi and fsi absorptive factors as obtained from these two procedures are in reasonable coincidence @xcite .",

    "actually , our approach for isi & fsi treatment is mostly phenomenological and our assumptions can be mainly justified by comparison with experimental data ( we will discuss it in more detail in the next sections ) : pure born terms give rise to a cross section that does not reproduce real photon data at high w by a large factor , while absorption - corrected calculations are able to give a good account of data up to w around 2 gev .",

    "the resonances included in the evaluation are listed in table i. the relative contribution of a particular @xmath1 in the cross section can be described by the factor of merit @xmath191@xmath192 also reported in table i. all three- and four - star resonances@xcite with @xmath193 were included .",
    "as follows from table i , @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 resonances give maximum contribution and reaction ( 1 ) presents a promising opportunity for investigation of their structure .    as mentioned in sect .",
    "3.1 , we adopted two ways for @xmath3-in - flight term evaluation : a ) from gauge invariance requirements ; b ) neglecting this term due to proximity of @xmath3 mass and @xmath76 cut - off parameter .",
    "neglecting @xmath3-in - flight term we obtained a better data description at high w value and pion emission angles .",
    "the results are presented in fig . 6 by solid lines .",
    "the data are reasonably reproduced in the overall w region .",
    "a remarkable point is that our calculations predict cross sections at @xmath197 and @xmath2 gev lower than 1.2 @xmath198b / sr ; such strong cross section suppression namely results from absorption in the initial and final states due to interactions with open hadronic channels . for w = 1.62 gev",
    "the calculated cross sections are a bit below the data points ; this discrepancy could be ascribed to simultaneous uncertainties in the cut - off parameter appearing in the strong vertex function used for the born terms , in the @xmath199 , @xmath200 elastic amplitudes appearing in the absorption parameterisation , as well as to uncertainties in some s - channel @xmath1 electromagnetic and strong parameters . the born term contribution in angular distributions for reaction ( 1 )",
    "is shown by dashed lines in fig .",
    "6 , therefore the maximum @xmath1 contribution takes place for cm pion emission angle above @xmath201 .",
    "the evaluation of angular distributions performed by varying @xmath1 strong decay couplings inside uncertainties of analysis @xcite demonstrated that the cross section variation does not exceed a few percent , being negligible compared with data uncertainties : therefore , our approach for the non - resonant background appears to be quite stable with respect to @xmath1 strong decay parameter variation ; this is an important feature for the extraction of @xmath1 electromagnetic form factors from measured cross sections .",
    "the comparison between the calculated total cross section for reaction ( 1 ) with recent saphir data@xcite as well as with old abbhhm collaboration data@xcite is presented in fig . 7 . decomposition of the total cross - section for reaction ( 1 ) in resonant , non - resonant processes and interference terms is also shown in fig .",
    "the maximum contribution of @xmath1 ( at level @xmath202 ) is found at @xmath203 gev and decreases as w increases .",
    "the region @xmath203 gev also corresponds to maximum contribution of interference effects in coincidence with results presented in @xcite .    to demonstrate the effects of @xmath47 form factor implementation as well as isi and fsi absorptive corrections , we also reported in fig . 8 calculation results assuming : a ) @xmath47 form factor equal to unity and absence of absorptive corrections ( dashed line in fig . 8) ; b ) @xmath47 form factor from @xcite and absence of absorptive corrections ( dotted line in fig .",
    "8) ; c ) complete model ( solid line ) .",
    "calculation a ) is not able to reproduce data at all : at @xmath13 gev the difference between calculated and measured cross - section marks the complete failure of the pure born terms calculation .",
    "implementation of @xmath47 strong form factor turns out to be very important ( dotted line of fig .",
    "8) : we stress that such strong vertex function was taken from n ",
    "n scattering analysis without further tuning and assumed to be appropriate to describe the @xmath47 vertex in the t - channel pion exchange diagram , while for the contact term which is of similar magnitude as the pion exchange , we used gauge invariance as guidance for the vertex functions evaluation .",
    "however without initial and final state absorptive corrections it is not possible to reproduce data at w above 1.7 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "even neglecting isi and fsi effects our approach is able to describe reasonably the data at @xmath203 gev .",
    "implementation of isi and fsi absorptive correction factors provides a reasonable agreement between measured and calculated cross sections for w below 1.8 gev , while for w above 1.9 gev calculated cross sections are systematically higher than data .",
    "the reason for such deviation could be connected to the description of @xmath204 , @xmath94 elastic scattering amplitudes in isi - fsi : this aspect could be improved by adding contributions from isobar states with higher mass and spin ; another explanation could be that for w above 1.9 gev we may start to observe a transition from the corrected born terms picture to other processes , as those discussed in @xcite ; in this case , the framework for non - resonant reaction mechanisms in @xmath98 reaction should be modified at w above 1.9 gev .",
    "we discuss these aspects in the next paragraph , to examine the limits of applicability of our meson - baryon approach and study how to continue the description of reaction ( 1 ) in the higher energy region .",
    "following the recipe of @xcite , we replaced the pion exchange amplitude in born term ( fig .",
    "1c ) by a pion regge trajectory exchange .",
    "the results are presented in fig . 9 ( dotted line ) and compared with the non - reggeized pion exchange ( solid line ) .",
    "regge trajectory exchange implementation provides a better data description at high w values .",
    "however , even in this case the calculated cross section appears to be systematically higher than the data .",
    "the possible reason could be the need to modify also the contact term in the way proposed in @xcite , thereby restoring gauge invariance .",
    "we found that such contact term modification led to a sizeable cross section reduction at w below 1.6 gev , where descriptions in the frame of pion and regge trajectory exchange have to coincide . to provide this coincidence we had to require @xmath205 ",
    "( pion regge trajectory ) effective coupling to be a factor 1.2 higher than @xmath47 coupling .",
    "the cross section calculated under this assumption is shown in fig .",
    "9 with a dashed line and reproduces reasonably the data up to 2.5 gev .",
    "as mentioned above , non  resonant part for @xmath97 and @xmath94 elastic scattering amplitudes in isi - fsi was estimated from @xmath147 scattering partial wave data fit@xcite , containing data up to w @xmath206 2.1 gev .",
    "this is the main reason to restrict our calculation to w @xmath206 2.5 gev ( 3 gev photon energy in lab .",
    "frame ) . implementation of any data on @xmath97 and @xmath94 elastic scattering amplitudes above 2 gev would allow a model extension toward higher w.    to investigate the influence of @xmath136 vertex dressing on our cross section , we reported in fig .",
    "10 the calculations with @xmath1 electromagnetic helicity amplitudes taken from pdg@xcite and from quark models@xcite . in the pdg case , we assumed the effects of @xmath136 vertex dressing at level of meson  baryon degrees of freedom to be included in the numbers quoted , while in the quark models case we assumed such effects not to be accounted for ( `` bare '' @xmath136 vertices ) . therefore , using the pdg amplitudes we applied our prescription ( 24 ) for removal of @xmath1 dressing in isi - fsi , while in cross section calculations with @xmath136 vertices from quark models we kept @xmath1 excitation terms in isi & fsi mechanisms with no modification .",
    "in principle , one would expect these two results approximately to coincide , assuming that the same dressing effects are introduced one way or another .",
    "our results show that this is not the case , being the cross section calculated using the `` dressed '' pdg values systematically higher than the quark model results ; moreover , if we removed completely the @xmath1 from the isi - fsi description , the discrepancy would be even bigger ; we also found that the difference between the two quark model cross sections is significantly smaller than the deviation between quark model and pdg results .",
    "actually , the difference between the cross section evaluated with `` bare '' and `` dressed '' vertices could be due to specific approximations of quark model approaches@xcite ; or it could be an indication that additional dressing effects are present in the experimentally extracted photocouplings from @xcite .",
    "this difference does not exceed 30 % , with a maximum at w between 1.5  1.7 gev .",
    "this w range actually corresponds to maximum @xmath1 contribution .",
    "the discrepancy appears to be negligible at w above 2.0 gev and below 1.4 gev , where @xmath1 contributions are less pronunced .    to see the influence of particular dressing effects ",
    "@xmath1 excitation in @xmath97 and @xmath94 elastic scattering processes shown in fig .",
    "we performed calculations using `` dressed '' @xmath1 electromagnetic vertices@xcite , but keeping the @xmath1 excitation in isi & fsi mechanisms for born terms .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "10 by dotted line ; of course in this case some double counting of the @xmath1 electromagnetic vertex dressing takes place , but surprisingly the cross section seems to be in better agreement with the `` bare '' quark model results . in any case , the difference between solid and dotted curves could be considered as estimation of this particular @xmath136 vertex dressing contribution in the cross section .",
    "this contribution is lower than 20 % and vanishes at w above 2.0 gev , where @xmath1 excitation is negligible .    to extract @xmath1 helicity amplitudes for @xmath16",
    "it is important to have a good description of the @xmath29 dependence for non - resonant processes .",
    "we checked this point by comparing the total cross section for reaction ( 1 ) calculated in our approach with data reported in @xcite .",
    "for the resonant part we used results from a single quark transition model ( sqtm ) fit@xcite about the @xmath29 evolution of @xmath1 photocouplings . the comparison between data@xcite and our calculations is presented in fig .",
    "11 where dashed lines correspond to the contribution of non  resonant processes only , while the complete evaluation with @xmath1 included is shown by solid lines . considering this comparison , two important points must be stressed : first , bins for experimental data@xcite , both in w and @xmath29 were very wide , implying a strong cross section averaging over the measured kinematical range ; second , experimental data about high - lying @xmath1 photocouplings are rather scarce and do not allow to check the validity of sqtm predictions .",
    "however , our approach reproduces the measured cross - section for w in the 1.3 - 1.5 gev and in the 1.5 - 1.7 gev interval ; for w in the 1.7 - 2.0 gev bin our calculated cross - section is higher than the measurements ; the reasons for such deviation could be namely the poor knowledge of the @xmath1 contributions or the kinematical average effects , as well as the above mentioned limitations in the treatment of born terms absorption in the higher w region .",
    "new high precision data upcoming from new facilities like tjnaf are therefore definitely needed for a better understanding of the @xmath29 behaviour of @xmath1 electromagnetic form factors .",
    "an important prediction of our evaluations is a strong @xmath1 contribution in the w = 1.5  1.7 gev interval , representing over 60 % of cross section at @xmath207 gev@xmath72 .",
    "therefore the two pion exclusive channel seems to present a promising opportunity for @xmath1 structure investigation by photons with high virtuality .    to investigate @xmath1 electromagnetic vertex dressing effects on the cross section at @xmath16",
    ", we performed the calculation with @xmath1 electromagnetic form factors taken from different approaches@xcite .",
    "form factors in approach@xcite were determined from exclusive single pion production data analysis , imposing symmetry relations between form factors of @xmath1 s belonging to a particular su(6 ) multiplet : therefore they can be assumed to represent `` dressed '' vertices . instead",
    ", quark models @xcite should not contain higher order corrections and we considered their results as representing `` bare '' vertices .",
    "again we expected to have approximate coincidence of results obtained using these different ingredients .",
    "actually in this case , according to fig .",
    "12 , the difference between cross sections calculated with the two `` bare '' vertices @xcite and @xcite is higher than the difference between results obtained using form factors from @xcite and quark models results .",
    "also in this case we calculated the cross section using `` dressed '' vertices from @xcite , with and without prescription ( 24 ) for @xmath1 removal in isi - fsi ( solid and dotted curve in fig .",
    "12 , respectively ) ; in the latter case the result is supposed to be affected by double counting , but the difference can give an indication of the extent of dressing introduced by our effective unitarity implementation ; as shown in fig .",
    "12 , such effect appears to be negligible , thereby indicating that , for the @xmath16 evolution in our framework , quark model theoretical uncertainties could be more important than dressing effects .",
    "therefore , comparison of cross sections calculated in our approach with forthcoming precise experimental data at @xmath16 can provide a promising opportunity to select between model approaches for @xmath1 structure description in non  perturbative qcd region .    as mentioned above",
    ", we also compared the cross section calculated using `` dressed '' @xmath1 form factors@xcite with / without implementation of @xmath1 excitation in isi & fsi mechanisms ( dotted and solid lines in fig .",
    "the contribution of this particular dressing mechanism is negligible for w@xmath208 1.4 and 1.85 gev and vanishes at @xmath209 gev@xmath72 for w @xmath210 gev .",
    "there are actually reasons for such behaviour : a ) the relative contribution of non  resonant processes drastically falls down as @xmath29 increases ( from more than 80 % at the photon point to lower than 50 % at @xmath29 above 1 gev@xmath72 ; b ) the isi effects also go down as @xmath29 increases due to suppression of transitions between photon and vector meson .",
    "we have extensively studied a phenomenological model for the two pion photo- and electroproduction through the intermediate @xmath211 channel , as part of a broader effort in establishing a basis for analysis and interpretation of the upcoming data from tjnaf@xcite , where this as well as other exclusive electromagnetic production channels will be studied with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "our calculation included a minimal set of born amplitudes , with appropriate absorptive corrections to effectively take into account interaction with open channels in the initial and final states , plus a large number of nucleon resonances that , according to the existing data , are thought to give a sizeable contribution to the cross section .    a strong form factor for @xmath17 vertex was introduced according to nn scattering experiments .",
    "data about pion and proton electromagnetic form factors were also used to evaluate the pion - in - flight term and the s - channel nucleon pole term , respectively , for @xmath212 , while the @xmath29 behaviour of the contact term was obtained imposing gauge invariance ; the delta - in - flight term was calculated both from gauge invariance and using a @xmath17 vertex determined from nn scattering analysis .",
    "strong and electromagnetic @xmath1 couplings were related with experimental observables : electromagnetic helicity couplings @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and partial hadronic decay widths @xmath213 .",
    "we found that strong absorptive corrections were essential to reproduce experimental data for cm pion emission angle above 30@xmath214 at w above 1.6 gev .",
    "we developed a specific approach for isi and fsi absorptive corrections , relating absorptive factors in ingoing and outgoing channels with @xmath0 and @xmath94 elastic scattering amplitudes .",
    "these elastic strong amplitudes were evaluated in a simple isobaric model , so that our approach did not have any free parameters to be determined from reaction ( 1 ) . any other approach for @xmath0 and @xmath94 elastic amplitude evaluation can be easily implemented in our calculation .",
    "reasonable reproduction of pion angular distributions in the photon point as well as good agreement between measured and calculated total cross sections for @xmath16 demonstrate the ability of our approach to reproduce the main features of @xmath0 production by real and virtual photons in the resonance region .",
    "moreover the proposed method for isi and fsi description can be considered as a reasonable phenomenological way to describe non - resonant processes in electromagnetic meson production for @xmath13 gev , where the competition of many open hadronic channels makes a rigorous background evaluation very difficult .",
    "our unitarity corrections effectively introduce a dressing of the resonance amplitudes ; therefore we elaborated an empirical prescription to remove the dressing from isi - fsi when using experimental resonance photocouplings , assumed to be already `` dressed '' ; we also performed calculations without this prescription when using resonance amplitudes from quark models , asssumed to be `` bare '' . in the real photon case",
    ", we found that the calculations performed with two different quark models show a good agreement , while the results obtained using the experimental pdg amplitudes show a systematic disagreement with the previous ones ; the reason is unclear and could be connected to other dressing effects than @xmath1 excitation in @xmath115 @xmath139 transitions as well as to quark model uncertainties and also to model - dependence in the experimental resonance amplitude extraction .",
    "we performed the same analysis for the virtual photon cross section , but in this case we found a disagreement between the two quark models adopted , while the calculation based on resonance amplitudes extracted from an analysis of experimental data showed less sensitivity to our `` dressing '' effects : the quark models discrepancies appeared to be more important , leading us to believe that in the virtual photon case the sensitivity to different quark model ingredients could be more pronunced , although the reason for the different behaviour of real and virtual photon is not evident .",
    "the calculation presented could serve as a first basis for interpreting the data coming from new facilities like jefferson lab and moreover , allowing the resonance parameters to vary , it could be the starting point of a fitting procedure with the goal of investigating electromagnetic form factors for high mass @xmath1 s ( @xmath215 gev ) , as well as for attempting to discover new states .",
