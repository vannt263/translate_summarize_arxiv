    "while there is a steady interest in physics involving baryons with strangeness and a corresponding increase of empirical information ever since the discovery of the @xmath5-hyperon many decades ago , the present times seem to be particularly rewarding .",
    "first , at new experimental facilities like j - parc in japan or fair in germany a significant amount of beam time will be devoted to strangeness physics research .",
    "the proposed experiments encompass accurate measurements of level spectra and decay properties of strangeness @xmath6 and @xmath7 hypernuclei @xcite but also of elementary cross sections for @xmath8 scattering @xcite .",
    "information on @xmath9 scattering , specifically on the scattering lengths , might emerge from ongoing studies of the final - state interaction in production reactions like @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "parallel to this development , techniques for dealing with few- and many - body systems have reached a high degree of sophistication @xcite .",
    "some of these allow one to consider nuclei with much more than four nucleons , the limit for standard few - body calculations with the faddeev - yakubovsky theory @xcite . of particular interest in this context",
    "are nuclear lattice simulations as they offer a new many - body technique directly tailored to the effective field theory description of baryon - baryon interactions , as high - lighted recently by the first ever _ ab initio _ calculation of the hoyle state in the spectrum of @xmath12c  @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems to be feasible to perform similar calculations of hypernuclei too , with comparable accuracy as those for ordinary nuclei , which would open a completely new testing ground for the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) interaction .",
    "though few - body calculations of hypernuclei can be already found in the literature @xcite , for the latter aspect it would be desirable to employ techniques that allow one to use directly the elementary @xmath13 interaction ( i.e.  without any approximation ) and , in particular , to include the important @xmath14-@xmath15 conversion . only then one can connect the properties of the hypernuclei unambiguously with those of the underlying @xmath16 ( and @xmath17 ) interaction .    finally , and on a different frontier ,",
    "lattice qcd calculations have matured to a certain degree , as documented in recent review articles  @xcite , and are coming closer to a level where they can provide additional constraints on the baryon - baryon interactions in the strangeness sector @xcite .    to keep up with these developments we present here a study of the @xmath13 interaction performed at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in chiral effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "it builds upon and extends a previous investigation by the bonn - jlich group carried out at leading order ( lo ) @xcite . using chiral eft for the @xmath13 interaction is prompted by the great success that this scheme has met in the application to the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath18 ) interaction .",
    "indeed , proposed by weinberg @xcite more than two decades ago , chiral eft has turned out to be a rather powerful tool for the derivation of nuclear forces .",
    "its most salient feature is that there is an underlying power counting which allows one to improve calculations systematically by going to higher orders in a perturbative expansion .",
    "in addition , it is possible to derive two- and three - nucleon forces as well as external current operators in a consistent way .",
    "we are now at a stage that the latter aspect will also be important for realistic studies of hypernuclear interactions . in the past",
    "there have been already discussions on the role of a three - body @xmath13 interaction @xcite in hypernuclei and specifically for the properties of neutron star matter @xcite .",
    "as the most recent applications demonstrate , the nucleon - nucleon interaction can be described accurately within the chiral eft approach @xcite . in line with the original suggestion of weinberg ,",
    "the power counting is applied to the @xmath18 potential rather than to the reaction amplitude .",
    "the latter is obtained from solving a regularized lippmann - schwinger equation for the derived interaction potential .",
    "the chiral @xmath18 potential contains pion - exchanges and a series of contact interactions with an increasing number of derivatives .",
    "the latter represent the short - range part of the @xmath18 force and are parametrized by low - energy constants ( lecs ) , that need to be fixed by a fit to data .",
    "for reviews we refer the reader to the recent refs .",
    "@xcite .    in our study of the @xmath13 interaction ,",
    "we follow the scheme that has been applied by epelbaum et al .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath18 interaction . for investigations of the @xmath13 interaction based on other schemes",
    "see @xcite . still , there are some essential differences between the @xmath16 , @xmath17 systems and the @xmath18 case that have an influence on how one proceeds in the application of chiral eft in practice .",
    "first and foremost , there is no phase - shift analysis for the @xmath6 sector and , therefore , we have to fix the lecs by a direct fit to data rather than by a fit to individual partial waves as it is done in the @xmath18 case .",
    "secondly , the amount of @xmath13 data is rather limited . indeed , there are basically only integrated cross sections , often with large uncertainties .",
    "thus , we follow here the practice of previous investigations of the @xmath13 interaction , notably those performed in the meson - exchange picture @xcite , and impose constraints from su(3 ) flavor symmetry in order to reduce the number of free parameters . in particular , all the baryon - baryon - meson coupling constants are fixed from su(3 ) symmetry and the symmetry is also exploited to derive relations between the various lecs . in the actual calculation",
    "the su(3 ) symmetry is broken , however , by the mass differences between the goldstone bosons ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and between the baryons .",
    "for these masses we use the known physical values . in any case , we want to stress that we consider the imposed su(3 ) symmetry primarily as a working hypothesis and not as a rigorous constraint .",
    "future data with higher precision will possibly demand to depart from su(3 ) symmetry in some way . in that sense",
    "our present investigation certainly has primarily an exploratory character . at the moment we are able to describe the available @xmath16 and @xmath17 data consistently without any explicit su(3 ) breaking in the contact interactions as will be demonstrated below .",
    "a simultaneous description of the @xmath18 interaction with contact terms that fulfil su(3 ) symmetry turned out , however , to be not possible .",
    "as mentioned above , in order to obtain the reaction amplitude from the interaction potential derived within chiral eft , one has to solve a regularized lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the question how this regularization should be performed is an open issue and is still controversially discussed in the literature , see , e.g.   @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we refrain from touching this certainly very important question .",
    "rather we follow closely the procedure adopted by epelbaum et al .",
    "@xcite and others @xcite , in their study of the @xmath18 interaction and introduce a momentum - dependent exponential regulator function into the scattering equation .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows : in sect .  2",
    ", a review of the chiral eft approach is given with special emphasis on the imposed su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "in particular , the structure of the contact interactions at lo and nlo is specified and the expression for the one - meson exchange contributions are reproduced .",
    "a detailed description of the two - boson exchange potential that arises at nlo is presented in the appendix .",
    "the strategy followed in the fit to the data is outlined in sect .",

    "results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions obtained at nlo are discussed and compared to available experimental information .",
    "results of our lo calculation and of the jlich 04 @xmath13 interaction @xcite , a conventional meson - exchange model , are presented , too .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary . in the appendix ,",
    "we provide expressions for the two - boson exchange potential .",
    "furthermore we summarize su(3 ) breaking effects which arise at nlo from quark mass insertions in the interaction lagrangian .",
    "the derivation of the chiral baryon - baryon potentials for the strangeness sector at lo using the weinberg power counting has been outlined in refs .",
    "the nlo contributions for the @xmath18 case are described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the extension to the baryon - baryon case has been worked out in ref .",
    "the lo potential consists of four - baryon contact terms without derivatives and of one - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges . at nlo contact terms with two derivatives arise , together with loop contributions from ( irreducible ) two - pseudoscalar - meson exchanges .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] .",
    "the spin dependence of the potentials due to leading order contact terms is given by @xcite @xmath19 where the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are low - energy constants ( lecs ) that need to be determined in a fit to data . at",
    "next - to - leading order the spin- and momentum - dependence of the contact terms reads @xmath22 the transferred and average momentum , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are defined in terms of the final and initial center - of - mass momenta of the baryons , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "such transitions can not occur in the @xmath18 interaction , unless isospin symmetry breaking is included , and , therefore , this term is absent in the equations given in ref .",
    "however , in general , this antisymmetric spin - orbit term is allowed . specifically , it does not break su(3 ) symmetry .    assuming only isospin symmetry , the lecs for each spin - isospin channel of the various @xmath46 interaction potentials are independent .",
    "when imposing @xmath47 flavor symmetry one obtains relations between the lecs and , thereby , the number of terms that need to be fitted to data gets reduced .",
