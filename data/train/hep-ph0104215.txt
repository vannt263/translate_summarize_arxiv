    "<S> smaller bubbles can be produced ( if they exist ) with strongly suppressed probability .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    our world may be a 4-dimensional flat submanifold of a strongly curved 5-dimensional spacetime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one such scenario  @xcite may explain the gauge hierarchy problem when the 5-dimensional curvature radius is at the planck scale and spacetime is a thin  sandwich \" between two 4-dimensional surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the surfaces may be stabilized at a distance somewhat exceeding the planck length by supposing scalar fields in the  bulk \" and proper type of interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively  @xcite , an infinite sized fifth dimension is also conceivable with effectively 4-dimensional gravity on one  brane \" . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk is a slice of @xmath4 with only gravity living there , with a negative cosmological constant @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the brane is stabilized by requiring that the metric is symmetric (  orbifold symmetry \" ) in the fifth coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> the flatness our world is ensured by the ( extreme ) fine tuning of the tension of the brane @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the 5-dimensional planck mass and @xmath8 is the ads length . the resulting strength of the 4-dimensional effective gravity comes out to be @xmath9 , identified with the planck mass @xmath10 . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the hierarchy problem is not addressed , though . </S>",
    "<S> another version of the same set of ideas appeared in  @xcite , where it is shown that a world confined to a third brane with small positive tension located inside the  sandwich \" would also experience four - dimensional gravity . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the  middle \" brane clearly can not be located at an orbifold fixed point .    in these frameworks two of the three parameters ( @xmath11 ) </S>",
    "<S> are fixed by the fine tuning and the observed value of the newtonian gravitational constant . </S>",
    "<S> the third parameter is not restricted . in the @xmath12 framework where the aim is the hierarchy problem , it is natural to suppose that all parameters are on the same ( planck ) scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been speculated in  @xcite , that the brane tension ( @xmath13 ) could be as small as @xmath14 , which corresponds to an ads length of @xmath15 and such models were referred to as @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this scale corresponds to the limit imposed by the present experimental limits to modifications of newtonian gravity . </S>",
    "<S> a brane tension of this size is naturally expected from low - scale supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> coincidentally , the present limits on the observed cosmological constant could be explained by ignoring the gravitational effect of small - length quantum fluctuations ( i.e. the coupling of their zero - point energies to gravity ) , shorter than @xmath17 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is the observed value of the cosmological constant  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that such a framework is attractive enough to consider its phenomenological consequences , even though it is somewhat awkward to embed it in an underlying brane theory . </S>",
    "<S> that might require the introduction of a very large number of coincidental branes .    in order to orient our thinking we provide one consistent set of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> a five - dimensional gravity scale @xmath19 and a cosmological constant @xmath20 with a brane tension @xmath21 would provide the correct strength four - dimensional gravity and @xmath22 for the effective size of the extra dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenology of such a framework has been studied in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they found no collider signature , and argued that only modifications to newtonian gravity on the submillimeter scale might be observable . </S>",
    "<S> one might wonder however , if effects of nontrivial brane dynamics might show up in these models . oscillations of the brane should be suppressed only by ( powers of ) the @xmath14 brane tension . </S>",
    "<S> not surprisingly we find below that such oscillations correspond to a massless moduli field  @xmath23 in the 4-dimensional theory . </S>",
    "<S> there must be some mechanism that gives it a mass if phenomenological disaster is to be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> any mechanism of brane stabilization ( such as in  @xcite ) would do that . from a phenomenological point of view </S>",
    "<S> , this new scalar can be identified by the fact that it couples to the energy - momentum tensor of the standard model ( sm ) fields through operators . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of topologically nontrivial @xmath23 field configurations is also to be considered . in a 5-dimensional geometric language these correspond to creation of  bubbles \" , whose surface is made of the same brane material as our world , in high energy collisions through the interactions of the @xmath23 field with the sm particles . </S>",
    "<S> such  </S>",
    "<S> bubbling \" has been considered in  @xcite in the context of the usual @xmath24 model ( with planck - scale @xmath13 ) as an explanation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> , the bulk gravity scale @xmath7 remains large . ]    in the discussion below we will find that such bubble generation is impossible at the @xmath25 scale in models where our brane is  stuck \" in an orbifold fixed point of the geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the would - be moduli field then has mass on the planck scale . in the absence of such restriction however , bubbles can fly off in both directions of the brane with equal probability .    </S>",
    "<S> these bubbles , once created , tend to collapse under the influence of their brane tension . </S>",
    "<S> however , the vacuum energy of the fields living on the surface increases as their size decreases ( the casimir effect ) and those bubbles with appropriate topology and periodic boundary conditions for the sm fields will be stabilized at a size of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> as they are pointlike on the scale of the ads length , they will follow the geodesics on the 5-dimensional spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> these geodesics on the far - horizon side turn back and cross our brane again within a time and brane distance @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to the observation of displaced vertices in collider experiments . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , geodesics on the other side will accelerate away from the brane and bubbles on this side disappear from our world . </S>",
    "<S> if particles with baryon number , lepton number or electric charge are trapped on the escaping bubble , the experiment would observe nonconservation of these quantum numbers . because all this physics is on the @xmath14 scale </S>",
    "<S> , there is no true violation of the quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in  @xcite that the electromagnetic field of such disappearing charge can be consistently calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we do not address possible nonconservation of color here .    </S>",
    "<S> the action corresponding to the model under consideration is @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents collectively the sm fields and @xmath30 is the induced metric on the brane  @xmath31 . </S>",

    "<S> .  1 ) has a turning point at some @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the time it takes for the geodesics to return to the brane is readily calculated @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angle of the initial speed to the brane and @xmath39 is the initial 5-speed of the geodesic . as in an accelerator experiment we do not expect extremely ultrarelativistic bubbles , this time is in the submillimeter range .    </S>",

    "<S> the quantity @xmath45 is the standard model energy - momentum tensor ; @xmath46 is the einstein tensor calculated from the metric @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first equation is a variant of the geodesic equation . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that it is invariant under a rescaling of all energy - momentum on the brane ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) is a reflection of the equivalence principle .    in gaussian normal coordinates of the brane ( </S>",
    "<S> i.e. @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) the second equation becomes @xmath52 this can be replaced by the vacuum equations for @xmath53 and the israel conditions  @xcite @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the extrinsic curvature of the brane in the metric @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the first equation becomes @xmath56 this equation is ambiguous when no orbifold symmetry is imposed ( @xmath57 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a mathematically careful treatment of the variational problem in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 reveals that the correct equation is found if @xmath55 is replaced by the average of the two @xmath55 s on the twe sides of the brane in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rep ] .    in collider experiments we probe the regime where @xmath45 is much smaller than @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we can see in eqns .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq:6],[eq : isr],[eq : rep ] that the @xmath58 limit must be taken . </S>",
    "<S> then the metric @xmath47 does not feel the effect of the brane any more and is exactly @xmath4 , with the brane moving on this background , subject to only eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rep ] .    for a brane </S>",
    "<S> subject to orbifold boundary conditions , such fixed background prohibits all local perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> ( this situation is similar to what happens on a flat background . </S>",
    "<S> then the fixed surfaces of @xmath59 isometries are only flat planes . ) </S>",
    "<S> all processes involving bubble production ( or production of the moduli for that matter ) would be subleading in @xmath60 , suppressed by 15 orders of magnitude in our numerical example .    </S>",
    "<S> when no symmetry requirement is imposed , it is reasonable to write the equations of motion in flat 5-dimensional coordinates and specify the brane by one function ( normalized so for future convenience ) : @xmath61 the induced metric in these coordinates becomes @xmath62 the bulk part of the action is not varied any more but the brane part becomes @xmath63.\\ ] ] expanding this lagrangian in the @xmath23 field we see that is is canonically normalized and is coupled derivatively to the energy momentum tensor of the sm fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is not hard to see that all the couplings , both to fermions and bosons , are dimension 8 and higher . </S>",
    "<S> for example , to a scalar we have a coupling @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry @xmath65 corresponds to the translational invariance of the brane in the fifth direction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 field is then the goldstone boson corresponding to this symmetry .    such a massless moduli field with @xmath25-scale couplings phenomenologically unacceptable . </S>",
    "<S> however , its goldstone nature also implies that any explicit breaking of the fifth dimensional translations would give mass to the @xmath23 field . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , so do mechanisms that stabilize interbrane separations in models with more than one brane  @xcite . in this letter we are only trying to establish the generic consequences of the @xmath16 idea and simply suppose that one way or another such mass has been generated .    </S>",
    "<S> bubbles of brane matter can be considered as nontrivial topological configurations of the @xmath23 fields . </S>",
    "<S> the classical equations of motion can be found in terms of the @xmath23 field from the action in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : action ] . neglecting the sm fields , @xmath66 for small field strength </S>",
    "<S> these equations describe harmonic oscillations of the brane .    </S>",
    "<S> classically , these equations can be solved supposing spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a collapsing bubble with time dependent radius @xmath67 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] , @xmath68 the lifetime of the bubble equals @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being the total energy contained in the bubble . </S>",
    "<S> this result is physically not surprising . when the sm field are thrown away , </S>",
    "<S> there is nothing to counteract the brane tension in pulling together the bubble .    including the quantum fields on the surface of the bubble , the casimir effect generates a vacuum energy density @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the value and sign of the constant @xmath73 depends on the topology of the bubble and the boundary conditions ( periodic vs. antiperiodic ) , and is generically unknown . in a supersymmetric theory it may cancel  @xcite but even in the simple case of qed on @xmath74 its sign is presently debated  @xcite . a positive value of @xmath38 results in a stabilized bubble within a very short time @xmath75 , with the casimir energy roughly equal to the energy contained in the brane surface : @xmath76 this fixes the internal energy contained in the bubble at the @xmath25 scale . </S>",
    "<S> we may take the point of view that bubbles with all sorts of topologies will be created but only those with a positive @xmath38 survive .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation is analogous to perturbative bosonic string theory . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the classical string also collapses . in quantum language </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the presence of tachionic excitations . with more fields present on the worldsheet it is possible to arrange a situation </S>",
    "<S> when the tachionic modes decouple and the result is a spectrum with energy levels@xmath77 . in our case it is impossible to show without a detailed discussion of the field theory on the brane how such a mechanism explicitly works .    </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to the discussion of bubble production . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be noted first that the quanta of the @xmath23 field can be produced in pairs , due to the @xmath78 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this is a remnant of the @xmath79 symmetry of the lagrangian which remains even if the metric solution is not required be symmetric . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the probability to produce a bubble will be equal on the two sides . </S>",
    "<S> the difference shows up only at the scale of the @xmath80 curvature , well separated from the scale of bubble production .    in classical physics </S>",
    "<S> it is impossible to find the probability of producing a bubble in the linear approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the _ in _ state is vacuum and the @xmath81 symmetry prohibits any solution with @xmath82 . any solution arises as a consequence of the instability of the @xmath83 solution . </S>",
    "<S> even if we find such an unstable solution , the response is proportional to the input uncertainty of the @xmath23 field strength ( i.e. the brane position ) which is not described correctly by classical physics .    in order to provide at least a crude quantum description of bubble generation we first model the sm process . for technical simplification </S>",
    "<S> we look at ( 3-dimensional ) spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we take a state that contains one free particle localized in a region with radius  @xmath84 that is allowed to flow apart in time to all directions . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function at @xmath85 is chosen to be @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of this state is trivially found from the fourier transform of the wave function which satisfies the klein - gordon equation ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] . )    </S>",
    "<S> the energy - momentum tensor is calculated next @xmath87 e^ { -{\\rho^2\\over4}\\left({\\bf k}^2+{\\bf q}^2\\right ) } \\cos\\left [ t(e_{\\bf k}-e_{\\bf q})-{\\bf x}({\\bf k}-{\\bf q } )   \\right].\\ ] ]    in the next step we calculate the two particle state that is produced in the lowest order in @xmath88 in perturbation theory . note that although perturbation theory is not expected to be a good guide in the strong field regime , its predictions will provide the correct order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the state at time @xmath89 is @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92.\\ ] ] where the free - field operator generates an elementary excitation of the @xmath23 field .    </S>",
    "<S> the actual calculation of the probability to produce a topologically nontrivial field configuration requires exact knowledge of the fields on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> this is an unsolved problem beyond the scope of the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we conjecture that a bubble of size @xmath93 will form whenever the energy density is larger than @xmath13 in a region of size @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> if that happens , than with @xmath94 probability we will have a fluctuation of that compensates the force that is pulling together the brane . </S>",
    "<S> the intuitive classical image is that when the surface tension of the brane is compensated in a region , an instability develops and the brane will bulge out . such a would - be bubble , if long enough compared to its size , will rather detach than be pulled back into our world .    </S>",
    "<S> next we calculate the average energy density carried by the @xmath23 field . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq:16 ] , we find a short - distance divergence </S>",
    "<S> . we regulate it by calculating the total amount of energy contained within radius @xmath93 , @xmath96 with the @xmath23 mass neglected , @xmath97 , and @xmath98    the resulting averaged energy density is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] in the case when @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the production probability of a bubble is @xmath94 during time @xmath93 in a region of size @xmath93 wherever this energy density is in excess of @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> bubbles with size @xmath100 can never be generated ( with @xmath101 , the function @xmath102 is never @xmath103 , and for large @xmath93 it is more suppressed . ) the shape of the function in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4 ] tells us that to produce a bubble at all we need a minimum energy concentration @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> once we achieve that , bubbles of all sizes @xmath105 will be produced with unit probability ( this is a sign of that in the  hot \" region of size @xmath84 an instability occurs . )    </S>",
    "<S> we see now that copious bubble production requires that the incoming particles be localized in a region @xmath106 . in a particle beam </S>",
    "<S> @xmath84 corresponds to the beam energy , @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the above calculation shows is that the threshold of bubble production is at @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> this is so even for bubbles _ smaller _ than @xmath109 whose production is possible only through tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> even though the energy might be available in processes with @xmath110 , an energy density @xmath13 is not attained . </S>",
    "<S> once the above threshold is reached , the production probability is @xmath94 , the cross section is determined by the unitarity bound @xmath111 .    </S>",
    "<S> the above rudimentary calculation of the _ expectation value _ of the energy density disregards energy fluctuations . below the above threshold , with a small probability , it is possible that a large energy density fluctuation arises in a small region @xmath112 </S>",

    "<S> this state is far off - shell and this introduces a suppression @xmath117 , so the cross section is @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> if we look at the largest bubbles that can be produced ( they have the largest probability ) , @xmath119 , we find @xmath120 .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus find that a high power of the energy suppresses the production of small bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> these bubbles in fact correspond to the massless states in string theory but in our case their mass ( or existence ) can be established only in a detailed model . </S>",
    "<S> if they exist , they should be visible in accelerator experiments somewhat below @xmath121 they would show up most easily if a charged particle gets trapped on the bubble .    </S>",
    "<S> note that this effect does not induce ( apparent ) proton decay . </S>",
    "<S> even though bubbles may be produced with a tiny probability at energies less than a @xmath122 , no baryons can be trapped on them due to energy conservation . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , this is due to the fact that the bubble is not vanishing , only stopping to interact with our world .    </S>",
    "<S> note that in the cosmological context at present time , even in supernova explosions the available energy for bubble production is too small . with a reasonable choice of @xmath123 during the explosion , </S>",
    "<S> the average time a proton in a neutron star needs to form a bubble is ( according to the above cross section ) @xmath124 years , while the explosion lasts only tens of seconds .    in sum , </S>",
    "<S> the expected experimental signature includes ( i ) displaced vertices due to returning bubbles , ( ii ) missing energy and/or @xmath125 , as well as missing baryon number , lepton number and electric charge as soon as the total energy reaches @xmath126 . </S>"
