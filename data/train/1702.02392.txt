    "the emergence of spheroidal - dominant morphology of quiescent galaxies  while they migrate from the blue cloud to the red sequence  encourages to investigate the correlation between structural parameters with the cessation of star - formation activity .",

    "moreover , @xcite used central stellar mass surface density ( @xmath5 ) , which is the stellar mass in the central 1 kpc region of galaxies and found that this parameter shows less scattered relation with galaxies color than surface density , stellar mass and srsic index at intermediate redshift @xmath17 . following that",
    ", @xcite demonstrate this for local galaxies and stated the necessity of bulge formation for galaxies to be quenched , but not sufficient .",

    "nevertheless , results of these works suggest that determining distribution of stellar masses within galaxies , in particular central mass density , is important for better understanding of quenching mechanism . though the good correlation between central mass density and quenching does not prove the causal relation . @xcite",
    "have shown that a mass - dependent quenching mechanism acting on star - forming galaxies whose size follow the observed size - mass evolution leads automatically to a high central density at the onset of quenching , without however any causal connection between the central density and quenching .    in this paper , we study the stellar mass distributions of intermediate to massive galaxies from @xmath18 to @xmath1 , by deriving point - spread function ( psf ) corrected stellar mass profiles of these galaxies consistently at low and high redshifts , and further comparing the corresponding mass distribution parameters with star - formation rates of the galaxies .",
    "many studies used the evolution of light profiles of galaxies to constrain the primary mechanism for assembling the observed structural properties of galaxies at a given stellar mass .",
    "the optical - near infrared light could be a good representative of stellar masses , though the existence of color - gradients at low and high redshifts @xcite could affect estimating the true complex underlying stellar population within galaxies .",
    "the origin of the color - gradient could be due to variation of the stellar population age , dust content and stellar metallicity .",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass - weighted profiles of galaxies are more robust than the light - weighted profiles , while comparing different galaxy populations .",
    "hence , the constrains on the assembly history of various galaxies can be provided by studying their mass growth on the central and outer regions , at different epochs .",
    "therefore , tracing and constraining the plausible evolutionary models of galaxies could benefits from studying the evolution of the stellar mass distributions within them .",
    "several approaches are employed for deriving mass surface density of galaxies at low and high-@xmath19 . in recent works by @xcite and @xcite ,",

    "* ) overcome this by exploiting the empirical relation between rest - frame color and @xmath3 , however , as pointed by these authors , the effects of age , metallicty and dust are not exactly the same and hence introduce scatter around the color-@xmath3 relation . to infer the variation of the stellar masses and stellar populations , @xcite and @xcite fitted stellar population models to the resolved 2-dimensional images of the galaxies .",
    "thanks to the high - resolution , sensitive instruments on board of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) such as advanced camera for survey ( acs ) and wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) , this could be feasible out to high - redshifts ( @xmath20 ) . although , the lack of high - resolution middle infra - red images could slightly limited this method , the multi - wavelength observations will allow for fitting the stellar population models to a large sample of galaxies at these redshifts .",

    "recently , @xcite used observed 1-d profiles of galaxies to derive their mass - profiles .    in this study , we exploit the sed fitting technique on one dimensional `` psf - corrected '' light profiles of individual galaxies .",

    "defining the radius at which the extrapolation should be started beyond that point , is not an straightforward task . in order to secure that the results were not strongly biased toward our guess of this connection point and the extrapolation process in general , we have measured the half mass radii for each galaxy by fitting about 1000 srsic profiles starting at different radii and finding the most frequent output results . in order to check the reliability of this method",

    "accretion of mass via ( minor ) mergers or arrival of the newly quenched systems into red sequence , both are plausible scenarios for the differences @xcite .",

    "meanwhile the stellar mass densities in the outer regions also changes . therefore , comparing low-@xmath19 and high-@xmath19 star - forming galaxies at intermediate masses , the mass densities varies at all radii , meaning that these objects have assembled stellar masses in both central and outer regions with time , with a different growth rate at the center and the outskirts .",
    "hence it argues against the scenario of the formation of bulges prior to the disk at @xmath96 .",
    "however , as we discuss below , central densities varies less at later time comparing to the mass profiles at larger radii , therefore , suggesting slightly different time scales for their changes .",
    "perhaps , different mechanisms with different time scales could play separate roles for the evolution of mass profiles of star - forming galaxies , e.g. , accretion of gas into disk ( or maybe bulge ) and migration of stars into the central regions via mechanisms such as disk instabilities .",

    ", we show the same but for the star - forming galaxies at @xmath173 .",
    "the @xmath1 expected profiles of most massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath173 is very similar to the quiescent ones in the local universe .",
    "these massive star - forming galaxies have reached their relative maximum central densities by @xmath174 .",
    "this shows indeed that stellar mass and central density correlate , hence it is difficult to disentangle whether it is mass or density ( or even the halo mass ) that control the quenching .",

    "they have a more extended and less concentrated mass profiles .",
    "note that objects in the low mass bins might change their `` mass bin '' before they quench .",
    "this test recalls that star - forming galaxies at this high-@xmath19 need to grow their central densities and reach to a specific @xmath5 threshold value , prior to their quenching .",
    "the specific threshold of @xmath5 values depends on stellar mass and redshifts .",
    "it can be defined approximately by the median values of galaxies in green valleys ( gray shaded region of figure [ fig15 ] ) for each stellar masses and is shown in figure [ fig22 ] .",
    "the specific threshold values increase with redshift at fixed mass , implying higher central density threshold requirements for galaxies at high-@xmath19 to become quenched .",
    "@xcite showed similar evolution for the effective surface density threshold and pointed the reason for this evolution could be due to the higher specific star - formation rate at higher redshift .",

    "galaxies follow a `` knee - shaped '' path on the @xmath5-@xmath150ssfr plane at all masses and independent of redshift , i.e. , galaxies need to build central densities before quenching .",

    "the complexity of the light profiles of galaxies due to sub - structural components ( e.g. , inner disks , clumpy features , etc . ) could have introduced deviations of galaxies surface brightness profiles from the best - fit single - srsic profiles and consequently on the derived stellar mass densities . to test whether this could have affected the results of this work , we follow @xcite and apply the same technique to derive the corrected surface brightness profiles in different filters .",
    "the de - convolved profiles of galaxies are derived by fitting psf convolved single - srsic models to the observed two dimensional surface brightness images of galaxies .",
    "we then derived the residual profile of galaxies , taking into account the geometry and position of the best - fit model and added this to the best - fit de - convolved srsic model . where the uncertainties of the sky background dominate , we extrapolated the profiles at the larger radii , using a srsic model profile .",

    "a comparison with the left panels of figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] shows that the rate of evolution of half - mass radii of both quiescent and star - forming galaxies are consistent with the results based on the best - fit single - srsic models .",
    "this indicates that independent of the method for deriving the stellar mass profiles , the half - mass radii of quiescent galaxies at fixed masses increase with time .",
