    "the study of the tidally induced migration of protoplanets embedded in protoplanetary disks has received renewed attention in the last few years following the discovery of extrasolar giant planets ( hereafter egps ) .",
    "it is in particular the best candidate to explain the short period egps ( the so - called hot jupiters ) which are likely to have begun to form further out in the disk and migrated radially inwards .",
    "when the planet mass is small ( i.e. when its hill radius is much smaller than the disk thickness ) , the migration rate can be evaluated using linear analysis , and is shown to be proportional to the planet mass , to the disk surface density , and inversely proportional to the square of the disk aspect ratio @xcite .",
    "the linear regime is often called the type  i regime .",
    "it corresponds to a fast migration rate , although recent estimates @xcite show that the linear analytical estimate assuming a flat two dimensional disk has to be reduced by a factor @xmath1@xmath2 or more in a more realistic calculation which accounts for the disk vertical structure and a possible non - saturation of the corotation torque if the disk is viscous enough .",
    "migration in the type i regime is nevertheless still too fast , in the sense that the migration timescale it yields is shorter than the build - up timescale of a giant protocore ( see e.  g.   * ? ? ?",
    "we shall not address this issue here but rather assume that a giant planet embryo can form in the disk at a distance @xmath3  au , and with a mass @xmath4 , where @xmath5  @xmath6 is the critical mass above which rapid gas accretion begins .",
    "when this embryo mass is large enough , it enters another well studied migration regime , called type  ii migration @xcite . in this regime",
    ", the protoplanet has a mass sufficient to open a gap in the disk , which is therefore split into an inner disk and an outer disk .",
    "the protoplanet then finds itself locked into the disk viscous evolution drifting inwards with it @xcite . as the protoplanet undergoes type  ii migration towards the central object , it may accrete the surrounding nebula material . the accretion rate scales with the mass accretion rate onto the central object @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the disk surface density . here",
    "one assumes that the processes at work in the disk which contribute to the angular momentum exchange between neighboring rings can be adequately modeled by a phenomenological kinematic viscosity @xmath9 . on the other hand ,",
    "the type  ii migration timescale is of the order of the disk viscous timescale @xmath10 .",
    "the maximum mass that a giant protoplanet can accrete on its way to the central object should be therefore of the order of @xmath11 , that is of the order of the disk mass interior to the planet starting distance .",
    "noticeably this mass does not depend on the disk viscosity . if the planet does not migrate all the way to the central object before the disk is dispersed , then because more time is spent at larger radii , it is most likely to be left with a semi - major axis larger than the typical one for hot jupiters ( @xmath12@xmath13  au , see * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the observed paucity of planets with masses exceeding two jovian masses at short periods @xcite .",
    "note too that planets undergoing type ii migration should tend to have higher masses at shorter periods .",
    "this is contrary to the observed trend .",
    "furthermore , as the planet mass grows , it becomes eventually larger than the surrounding disk mass , and its migration rate tends to drop , as the disk can not remove enough angular momentum from it .",
    "this has been investigated by @xcite . in this case",
    ", the amount of time necessary to bring the planet to a close orbit can be considerably larger than the disk viscous timescale , and can even exceed the disk lifetime .",
    "this migration slowing can be seen in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "it occurs _ soon _ after the planet has entered its type ii migration regime .    from the above considerations , it is questionable whether the orbital characteristics of most close orbiters can be accounted for by type  ii migration driven by the evolution of the disk",
    ". furthermore the vast majority of these have sub - jovian masses ( here one excepts and , which have large masses and which may have had a different origin ) .",
    "depending on the physical conditions of the protoplanetary disks in which they formed , they may not have fulfilled the gap opening criteria ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , with the consequence that they may have been involved in a migration regime intermediate between type  i and type  ii .",
    "this transitional regime has received little attention . @xcite and @xcite have worked out the feedback on the migration rate due to the nebula surface density profile perturbation under the action of the protoplanet lindblad torques .",
    "they introduced the concept of an inertial limit , that is the maximum mass of a protoplanet that can undergo steady state migration .",
    "it was suggested that masses above the inertial limit lead to a gap opening and to type  ii migration . in their analysis , @xcite neglected the coorbital dynamics and the corotation torque it implies on the migrating planet .",
    "the purpose of this work is to give an evaluation of the corotation torque for a migrating planet , and to analyze its consequences on migration .",
    "we define the notation in section  [ sec : notation ] , we present an appropriate expression for the corotation torque for a planet held on a fixed circular orbit in section  [ sec : corotfix ] , we then derive the corotation torque for a migrating planet in section  [ sec : derivation ] , and illustrate its properties using customized numerical simulations in section  [ sec : numres ] . as we investigate the intermediate regime between type  i and type  ii migration , for which the disk response is affected by non - linear effects , the hill radius and the disk thickness have comparable orders of magnitude .",
    "the regime of interest thus involves mildly embedded protoplanets .",
    "we assume that it can be safely studied through two dimensional flat disk calculations provided a reasonable value is adopted for the gravitational potential smoothing length . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we demonstrate the existence of runaway migration and relate the condition for its occurrence to the analytic discussion in section  [ sec : derivation ] . finally in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our results and we discuss their application to egps .",
    "we adopt a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath14 centered on the primary , the origin of which corotates with the planet which is located at azimuth @xmath15 . we consider a thin gaseous disk with mid - plane at @xmath16 , with surface density @xmath17 , orbiting a central point - like object of mass @xmath18 .",
    "the associated keplerian frequency is @xmath19 . in the unperturbed disk",
    "the orbital frequency is @xmath20 , which is usually slightly smaller than @xmath21 because the central acceleration is not only compensated for by the centrifugal acceleration , but also by a radial pressure gradient .",
    "the disk thickness is  @xmath22 and the disk aspect ratio is  @xmath23 . in this disk",
    "we consider an embedded planet with mass @xmath24 ( we note @xmath25 ) and semi - major axis @xmath26 .",
    "its orbital frequency is @xmath27 .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the case where its eccentricity  @xmath28 can be neglected .",
    "we now write the angular frequency as @xmath29 , and we denote by @xmath30 the radial velocity of the fluid element at @xmath31 .",
    "the link between the corotation torque and the horseshoe orbit drag has been indicated by @xcite .",
    "a torque estimate for a planet on a fixed circular orbit embedded in a viscous disk has been given by @xcite who considered a steady flow as seen in the planet frame .",
    "we here derive an expression for the corotation torque in a disk with very small viscosity .",
    "then the specific vorticity is conserved along a streamline ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we assume a steady flow in the planet frame . as we assume that the viscosity is low",
    ", we can write a bernoulli invariant along a streamline  : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fluid specific enthalpy and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the gravitational potential .",
    "the bernoulli invariant is a useful label of the librating streamlines in the horseshoe region .",
    "the corotation torque expression , following @xcite , can be obtained by summing the contribution to the torque due to individual fluid elements over the horseshoe annular slab . the positive contribution coming from the outer fluid elements caught up by the planet ,",

    "the gradient of the bernoulli invariant is linked to the flow vorticity ( see e.  g.   * ? ? ?",
    "if we denote by @xmath42 the vertical component of the flow vorticity in the inertial frame , then we have : @xmath43 where we use the fact that @xmath44 , and where we evaluate this expression sufficiently far from the planet so that we can assume @xmath45 and so that we can neglect the dependency of @xmath46 upon @xmath47 .",
    "this allows one to transform eq .",

    "if @xmath50 is the inverse of the specific vorticity , then : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are respectively the first and second oort s constants , evaluated at the planet orbit . here",
    "we assume that the planet mass is small enough that we can consider that a fluid element on an outer horseshoe leg at @xmath54 is mapped on the inner leg with radius @xmath55 , we have developed @xmath56 to first order in @xmath57 [ @xmath58 , and we have assumed @xmath59 .",
    "a similar treatment for the inner horseshoe leg yields the torque exerted on the protoplanet by the fluid elements which catch the planet up and are promoted to higher specific angular momentum orbits : @xmath60 it should be noted that the corotation torque , in the non - linear regime ( i.  e. for @xmath37 finite ) should include all the fluid elements which corotate , in average , with the planet , that is to say all the fluid elements which librate in the corotating frame .",
    "this includes not only the horseshoe streamlines , but also the circumplanetary disk ( corresponding to the closed streamlines interior to the roche lobe ) .",
    "we find it more convenient to consider only the horseshoe drag exerted on the system \\{planet + circumplanetary disk } , considered as a whole , and hereafter the planet should be understood as this system .",
    "we shall now use eq .",
    "( [ eq : tqp_u ] ) and  ( [ eq : tqm_u ] ) to evaluate the torque on a migrating object .",
    "we separate the orbital timescale @xmath61 ( which is also the horseshoe u - turn timescale from one leg to another ) from the horseshoe libration timescale @xmath62 , which is much longer . in particular , we neglect migration over the orbital timescale , while we consider it over the libration timescale .",
    "we say that migration is slow whenever the libration time of an outermost fluid element close to the separatrix between librating and circulating streamlines is short compared to the migration time across the horseshoe zone half width .",

    "we therefore have to consider the outer incident fluid elements at an azimuth @xmath68 .",
    "this azimuth needs to be small enough so that no significant radial drift occurs between the fluid element and the planet before the close encounter , and large enough so that the close encounter has not begun yet .",
    "similarly , the azimuth at which the incident inner fluid elements need to be considered has to be @xmath69 .",

    "the runaway limit for the low mass planets at the left of the vertical dashed line is likely higher than found in our analysis , as in their case only a fraction of the disk vertical extent is involved in the coorbital dynamics .",
    "the viscosity chosen for these runs is high enough that the dip viscous time @xmath279 is comparable to the libration time ( @xmath280 being the dip half - width ) .",
    "this time is also the dip opening time when the planet is `` switched on '' in the disk , or also the minimum time that the planet needs to sweep radially its own dip radial width in order for the surface density profile depression to follow the planet migration .",
    "it is therefore possible to talk unambiguously of _ the _ disk runaway critical mass for a given planet , independently of its `` preparation state '' . in other words , whether we release _ ab initio _ the planet in an unperturbed disk , or whether we hold it on a fixed circular orbit for a few hundreds of orbits in order to allow it to open a dip before being released makes no difference : a runaway is observed above the same disk mass , and the maximum drift rate measured is the same in both cases .",

    "this additional term , coupled to the one - sided lindblad torque , has been evaluated to order of magnitude by @xcite , and found to be small .",
    "since furthermore it does not participate in the feed back and therefore in the runaway , it is legitimate to have neglected it in the present analysis .",
    "the ability of the planet to maintain its coorbital mass deficit during a runaway episode deserves further investigation . before runaway , the coorbital region is partially cleared of disk material under the action of the lindblad torques . during the runaway drift , the lindblad torques are assisted in maintaining the coorbital mass deficit by the horseshoe dynamics , which traps the coorbital material .",
    "the streamlines are not exactly closed in the @xmath241 space , however , and the coorbital material can be lost . in that case",
    "the coorbital region is no longer depleted , and the planet switches to type  i migration , which endows it with a comparable drift rate .",
    "no case has been found in which the runaway is maintained `` forever '' .",
    "a single runaway episode however can sizably affect the planet semi - major axis , by a factor  @xmath1 or more .    in this work we have neglected accretion onto the protoplanets , whereas the mass range for which the runaway mechanism is relevant seems to imply gas accretion .",
    "a runaway episode is likely to be accompanied by a simultaneous accretion of disk material .",
    "a simple way to take into account gas accretion is to consider that a fraction @xmath291 of the material which enters the coorbital zone through one separatrix and flows out along the other one , is kept by the planet . in the absence of accretion , this disk material contribution to the corotation torque amounts to @xmath292 .",
    "when accretion is considered , the contribution to the corotation torque reduces to : @xmath293 since the material that is accreted onto the planet loses / gains only half of the specific angular momentum that it would lose / gain otherwise .",
    "accretion therefore plays the role of a runaway moderator .",
    "it would be of interest to investigate in detail the interplay between runaway and accretion , taking consistently into account the corotation torque feed back reduction and the growth of the horseshoe region .",
    "we have evaluated the torque exerted on a protoplanet embedded in a gaseous disk produced by the fluid elements as they perform a horseshoe u - turn in the planet vicinity .",
    "we have interpreted this torque as the coorbital corotation torque .",
    "this torque exhibits a dependency upon the planet radial drift rate in the disk which is tied to the depletion of the coorbital region of the planet , that is to say to the existence of a dip or gap cleared around the orbit .",
    "the sign of the corotation torque is the same as that of the drift rate .",
    "hence it exerts a positive feed back on the migration process .",
    "this feed back leads to a migration runaway in massive disks when the coorbital mass deficit is larger than the planet mass .",
    "we have checked and illustrated the main properties of the corotation torque through customized numerical simulations .",
    "these showed the link between runaway and the coorbital mass deficit .",
    "they indicated that the migration rate for disks with sub - critical masses grows faster than linearly with disk mass , and they illustrated that the planet drift rate characteristic response time is the horseshoe libration time .",
    "the occurrence of inward runaway in disks with @xmath294 has been investigated , and found to be likely in thin ( @xmath295  % ) , massive disks with a mass several times that of the mmsn .",
    "typically it occurs for saturn - sized giant protoplanets , but it can involve planets up to one jupiter mass for sufficiently massive disks . the runaway drift rate is found to be comparable to the type  i estimate given by the differential lindblad torque that one would obtain using linear theory even though that would be invalid for a planet held in a fixed circular orbit ( because the planet opens a significant dip around its orbit and the actual differential torque acting on it amounts to a small fraction of its linear estimate ) .",
    "it turns out that the corotation torque is at most equal to the differential lindblad torque in a @xmath294 disk .",
    "this prevents the possibility of outward runaway in these disks , and we indeed found no occurrence of outward runaways in such disks .",
    "additional runs with shallower disk profiles however have shown that outward runaway can occur , provided the planet is endowed with an adequate value for @xmath26 and @xmath76 ( this latter needs to be established at least over a libration time ) .",

    "@xcite have exhibited a two planet configuration engaged in an outward migration .",
    "their outer planet is of saturn mass , and is therefore a good candidate for outward runaway in a massive disk .",
    "an alternate possibility to initiate an outward motion is that the disk mass flow across the orbit is strongly variable in time .",
    "if a larger @xmath296 enters the coorbital zone through the outer separatrix , the corotation torque may be temporarily large ( and positive ) , providing the seed for an outward runaway .    when the viscosity is large enough , that the viscous diffusion time across the horseshoe zone is faster than the time to migrate through it , relaxation and depletion of the coorbital region occurs in a sufficiently short amount of time that the coorbital mass deficit and the disk critical mass for runaway are well defined quantities .",
    "the situation turns out to be much more chaotic in a very low viscosity disk , although globally the average drift rate of the planet towards the central object amounts to a sizable fraction of the type  i drift rate",

    "if protoplanetary disks are flared ( i.  e. @xmath297 ) , they could be extremely thin in their inner regions , which could assist runaway there .    a runaway episode or a succession of them stops whenever the coorbital mass deficit that can be achieved is too small .",
    "if one assumes a disk surface density profile @xmath298 , then the coorbital mass deficit scales as @xmath299 .",
    "as the runaway condition reads @xmath300 , one would get , at the end of the runaway episodes , the relationship @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is the planet orbital period .",
    "this indicates a tendency for smaller masses to reach smaller periods .",
    "a recent analysis by @xcite indicates a paucity of planets with masses exceeding a jupiter mass at small periods  @xmath303  a few days while sub jovian mass planets tend to cluster at these small periods .",
    "the observational data for the larger mass planets is consistent with a type ii migration scenario in which most time is spent at larger radii @xcite .",
    "however , the distribution of smaller mass objects would appear to require a relatively fast migration of the type discussed here followed by a slowing down or stopping near their current orbital locations .",
    "the fate of a giant protocore at the end of its runaway episode(s ) if it has not been brought close to the primary , would be a slow , type  ii migration , together with a possible mass growth , along the lines already studied e.  g. by @xcite followed possibly by stopping inside a magnetospheric cavity .",
    "an alternative scenario could be envisaged to account for the properties of egps . in this , the disks in which they formed would have been massive enough to sustain a succession of runaway episodes typically up to the central tenth of an astronomical unit where hot `` jupiters '' with @xmath304  @xmath274 , roughly corresponding to the most favorable mass for runaway , are found to accumulate ( or alternatively protocores that massive could be constituted in situ by the accumulation of lower mass bodies brought there by type i migration . )",
    "some of these hot proto - saturns could then be involved in outward runaway . at the same time , gas accretion onto these cores would eventually endow them with a mass sufficient to prevent any further runaway migration episodes .",

    "<S> we evaluate the coorbital corotation torque on a migrating protoplanet . the coorbital torque is assumed to come from orbit crossing fluid elements which exchange angular momentum with the planet when they execute a u - turn at the end of horseshoe streamlines . </S>",
    "<S> when the planet migrates inward , the fluid elements of the inner disk undergo one such exchange as they pass to the outer disk . the angular momentum they gain </S>",
    "<S> is removed from the planet , and this corresponds to a negative contribution to the corotation torque , which scales with the drift rate . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the material trapped in the coorbital region drifts radially with the planet giving a positive contribution to the corotation torque , which also scales with the drift rate . </S>",
    "<S> these two contributions do not cancel out if the coorbital region is depleted , in which case there is a net corotation torque which scales with the drift rate and the mass deficit in the coorbital region , and which has same sign as the drift rate . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a positive feedback on the migrating planet . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if the coorbital mass deficit is larger than the planet mass , the migration rate undergoes a runaway which can vary the protoplanet semi - major axis by @xmath0  % over a few tens of orbits . </S>",
    "<S> this can happen only if the planet mass is sufficient to create a dip or gap in its surrounding region , and if the surrounding disk mass is larger than the planet mass . </S>",
    "<S> this typically corresponds to planet masses in the sub - saturnian to jovian mass range embedded in massive protoplanetary disks . </S>",
    "<S> runaway migration is a good candidate to account for the orbital characteristics of close orbiting giant planets , most of which have sub - jovian masses . </S>",
    "<S> these are known to cluster at short periods whereas planets of greater than two jovian masses are rare at short periods indicating a different type of migration process operated for the two classes of object . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that in the runaway regime , migration can be directed outwards , which makes this regime potentially rich in a variety of important effects in shaping a planetary system during the last stages of its formation . </S>"
