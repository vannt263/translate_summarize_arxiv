    "there are several questions that motivated this research .",
    "first , it is natural to extend the concepts of domination , regularity and weight to rosy theories ( as it has already been done in the simple unstable context ) .",
    "one reason for doing this is `` coordinatization '' theorems : one would like to analyze an arbitrary type in terms of types that can be studied and classified more easily : regular ( admit a pregeometry ) , minimal , etc .",
    "we prove several results of this kind in section 3 .",
    "these provide a complementary picture to the recent work of assaf hasson and the first author @xcite where minimal types in super - rosy theories are investigated . for example , the two articles combined throw some light on types in theories interpretable in o - minimal structures .",
    "another motivation came from our desire to understand and develop the concept of _ strong dependence _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has recently become clear that this notion is strongly connected to weight . in @xcite",
    "the second author shows that every strongly dependent type has rudimentary finite generically stable weight .",
    "hence a stable theory is strongly dependent precisely when every type has finite weight .",
    "the latter conclusion has also been observed by adler in @xcite , as he studied the notion of `` burden '' , which generalizes weight and makes sense in any theory . a related concept ( within the context of dependent theories )",
    "is investigated by the authors in @xcite . a natural question that arises",
    "is : given a dependent theory with a good enough independence relation , does strong dependence always imply finite `` weight '' ?",
    "more precisely , we analyze the following two questions in this article . is thorn - weight finite in a strongly dependent rosy theory ?",
    "is there a natural notion of forking weight in an arbitrary dependent theory , and what is the connection to strong dependence ? we give a positive answer to the first question in section 2 , and address the second one in section 4 .",
    "several directions pursued in this paper require a delicate analysis of existence of mutually indiscernible ( sometimes morley ) sequences .",
    "claims of this form are proved in section 2 ( in rosy context ) and section 4 ( for dependent theories ) .",
    "we find these results of interest on their own and believe that they might have further applications .",
    "one interesting consequence of our analysis which has several applications beyond the study of weight is that in a dependent theory dividing ( say , over an extension base ) can be always witnessed by a morley sequence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    we start by defining notions related to forking and -forking , quoting some of the relevant results and proving others that will be needed throughout the paper .",
    "most of the paper is devoted to understand -orthogonality and the role of -regular and minimal types in rosy , super - rosy , and finite @xmath3-rank structures .",
    "we show many results analogous to those in stable ( and simple ) theories , and conclude with a strong decomposition theorem for types of finite rank in rosy theories .",
    "as we have already mentioned , this result suggests that analysis of minimal types ( as is done e.g. in @xcite ) leads to understanding of all types in a rosy theory of finite rank ( e.g. , a theory interpretable in an o - minimal structure ) .",
    "section [ th - orthognonality ] gives proofs of certain basic results on thorn - weight , thorn - domination and regularity .",
    "many of these proofs follow the lines of classical ones , but we still go through them carefully , and where the proofs diverge , we give alternative proofs for the -forking context or explain how to bridge the gaps . in this section",
    "we also connect thorn - weight to strong dependence and show that every type in a strongly dependent rosy theory has finite thorn - weight .",
    "we have recently learnt that hans adler has also written ( in an unpublished note ) a proof of the fact that in a rosy theory , rudimentarily finite -weight implies finite -weight ( theorem [ thm : finiteweight ] ) .",
    "both his and our proofs of this particular fact are mostly based on wagner s argument @xcite for simple theories , which is itself a generalization of hyttinen s results @xcite in the stable context .",
    "in contrast , the analysis of finite - rank theories in section [ finite ] is not close to the existing proofs for stable and simple theories .",
    "several useful technical tools applicable in this and related contexts are developed , the main one being proposition [ 2 ] .",
    "we believe that these tools should have many applications .",
    "finally , in section [ constructing ] we finish the paper by investigating sufficient conditions for existence of mutually indiscernible sequences in dependent theories and draw certain conclusions about the meaning of strong dependence , the behavior of forking and concepts related to weight .",
    "in particular it is shown that dividing in a dependent theory can normally be witnessed by a morley sequence .",
    "given a theory @xmath4 , we will work inside its monster model denoted by @xmath5 . by `` monster ''",
    "we mean that all cardinals we mention are `` small '' ( i.e. smaller than saturation of @xmath5 ) , all sets are small subsets of @xmath5 , all models are small elementary submodels of @xmath5 , and truth values of all formulae and all types are calculated in @xmath5 .",
    "we denote tuples ( finite unless said otherwise ) by lower case letters @xmath6 etc , sets by @xmath7 etc , models by @xmath8 etc .",
    "by @xmath9 we mean @xmath10 . recall that this is equivalent to having @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 .",
    "given an order type @xmath13 , a sequence @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we often denote the set by @xmath16 .",
    "similarly for @xmath17 etc .",
    "we also often identify the sequence @xmath18 with the set @xmath19 ; that is , when no confusion should arise we write @xmath20 etc .",
    "we will write @xmath21 for `` @xmath22 does not fork over @xmath23 '' even if @xmath4 is not simple .",
    "although non - forking is generally not an independence relation , we still find this notation convenient .    for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath24 for all theories @xmath4 mentioned in this paper .      since a big part of the paper deals with -forking and its properties",
    ", we will now define the basic concepts related to this notion .",

    "a possible notion of weight satisfying the property mentioned above was studied by the authors in @xcite .",
    "one drawback of that notion is that it `` measures '' weight of a type with respect to morley sequences ( and not elements ) .",
    "although by @xcite we know that a morley sequence is precisely what is needed in a dependent theory in order to determine a global invariant type ( so the definitions in @xcite are quite natural ) , we were ( and still are ) curious whether the definition of weight using morley sequences is equivalent to the classical notion .",
    "the answers to these questions are still unclear and they have motivated further research , such as @xcite , @xcite . we have discovered that in order to make sense of a notion of weight based on non - forking , one needs to understand under which conditions there exist mutually indiscernible sequences starting with given elements ( and to what extent one can `` determine '' the types of those sequences ) .",
    "let us explain more precisely what we mean .",
    "suppose one defined `` weight '' as usual ( like in stable theories ; that is , take the definitions in section 2 and replace -forking by forking ) .",
    "recall that one ingredient of the proof of theorem [ finite weight ] was showing that given a -independent set of elements ( tuples ) , there exist mutually indiscernible sequences starting with those elements . a natural question whether an analogous result holds for non - forking",
    "is answered positively by theorem [ mutually ind ] below .",
    "this is , unfortunately , not enough in order to prove a result similar to theorem [ finite weight ] : since we do not have any control over the types of those morley sequences , it is not clear why they should exemplify dividing ( recall that in the case of -forking life was easier , as we could work with strong dividing , which is exemplified by any infinite indiscernibly sequence in the type ) . of course",
    ", if @xmath4 were stable ( or even simple ) , there would be no problem , since any morley sequence would exemplify dividing .",
    "the discussion above leads to the following two questions :    [ qst1 ] to which extent can we `` control the types '' of the mutually indiscernible sequences constructed in theorem [ mutually ind ] ?",
    "more precisely : what must we assume about the set @xmath624 such that for every indiscernible sequences @xmath625 starting with @xmath626 respectively , there are indiscernible sequences @xmath627 such that @xmath628 is indiscernible over @xmath629 ?    [ qst2 ] to which extent do morley sequences exemplify dividing in a dependent theory ?    it was shown in @xcite that if the types realized by the @xmath626 s in question [ qst1 ] are generically stable , then it is enough to assume non - forking independence .",
    "this was the main ingredient in the proof of the main theorem of section 8 there : in a strongly dependent theory , every type has a rudimentarily finite generically stable weight ( below we give a much easier proof of this result based on theorem [ dividing with morley ] - see theorem [ theorem : finite gen stable weight ] )",
    ". we could not establish ( and in fact , it is still open ) whether assuming non - forking independence is enough given arbitrary @xmath626 with or without assuming the theory is dependent , but some progress in this direction has been made , and the results appear in the second half of this section .",
    "it has become clear in subsequent works ( @xcite , @xcite ) that question [ qst1 ] is related to so - called `` strict non - forking '' defined by shelah in @xcite .    concerning question [ qst2 ] , we prove that , although it is not the case that _ every _ morley sequence exemplifies dividing , there normally _ are _ such sequences .",
