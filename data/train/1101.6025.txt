    "is carried out , add up to zero for @xmath112 .",
    "the expansion velocity of the unpaired particles can be easily obtained considering the dispersion relation of a particle hopping through on an empty lattice @xmath115 leading to the group velocity @xmath116 since in our system we consider particles generated at a specific site ( @xmath9 ) , all momentum states contribute to the expression of the initial state . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_un ] ) we thus see that the maximum velocity is attained for @xmath117 @xmath118 which corresponds to the value obtained in the tebd simulation .",
    "analogously it can be shown that , for our initial configuration , the doublon hopping corresponds to the hopping of a particle with @xmath119 @xcite corresponding to the velocity of propagation of a charge excitation in the strongly attractive hubbard model .",
    "in particular , if we consider the case where no unpaired particles are present , we can map our system to an isotropic heisenberg chain by identifying @xmath120 and @xmath121 . to prove this , we consider :    1 .   a staggered particle - hole transformation @xmath122 which transforms our original system ( filling @xmath123 , magnetization density @xmath124 and interaction strength @xmath34 ) to a half - filled system with filling @xmath125 , magnetization density @xmath126 and interaction strength @xmath127 . since @xmath128 ; 2 .   by strong coupling second order expansion @xcite , the system hamiltonian",
    "is then mapped to an isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath129 with the mappings described above , since a doubly occupied site correspond to a spin up , and an empty site to a spin down , the band - insulator initial state @xmath130 is thus transformed to a spin chain with @xmath131 central spin - up sites surrounded by spin - down sites , and the expansion dynamics of the doublons corresponds to the propagation of a single spin - up excitation through a spin - down polarized system .",
    "its dispersion relation is given by @xmath132 and hence , analogously to the derivation of the maximum velocity for the unpaired particles , to @xmath133",
    "we have in the high interaction limit ballistic particles emitted from the diffusive core , the two types of ballistic particles being unpaired particles and doublons .",
    "these two expand at constant speeds ( @xmath39 and @xmath134 ) in wavefronts whose densities are so low that spin - spin scattering ( i.e. the hubbard dimer dynamics ) is negligible . in contrast , the core has high density , the dimer dynamics occur , and thus the core is diffusive . in the case of interactions",
    "lower than @xmath135 also the densities of the unpaired and doublon wavefronts become high enough for the dimer dynamics , which in the language of the classical non - linear diffusion model in @xcite makes the two types of wavefronts diffusive .",
    "this diffusive behaviour is seen in our results as the absence of ballistic wavefronts in density profiles ( see e.g. the @xmath136 case in fig .  [",
    "fig : sqrt_n ] above ) .",
    "finally , for the very low interactions @xmath137 the problem simplifies to ballistic expansion of non - interacting particles .    in order to compare our results to fig .",
    "5 of @xcite we arrive at the problem of defining the core . in the high interaction limit",
    "this is perhaps easier as the ballistic particles clearly separate from the central diffusive region , the core . in the middle interaction region",
    "( see again the @xmath138 case in figs .",
    "[ fig : sqrt_n ] and [ fig : sqrt_doubl ] below ) we see that only one outermost wavefront expands ballistically and therefore if we consider the diffusive region of the cloud to be the core then the core would be everything else but the outermost wavefront .",
    "this definition however is problematic in the low interaction limit ( u @xmath139 0.5 ) . in this limit",
    "everything can be described as expansion of non - interacting ballistic particles .",
    "so the definition of the core as the diffusive part of the cloud does not work any more as then we would not have a core at all .",
    "however , experimentally it might be easier to define a high density region to correspond to the core , and fit the half - power half - maximum of a gaussian to give the core width and subsequently the core expansion speed . in effect , then , in the low interaction regime the core is defined as the whole cloud , and in the middle and high interaction regimes the core is defined as everything else except the ballistic expansion fronts .",
    "this is what we have done in the main article .",
    "a variation of the above way of removing ballistic contributions would be to remove only the ballistic _ particle _ wavefronts , as the ballistic hole wavefronts may in effect be included in the experimental high density core region . to elaborate on what the hole wavefronts are , in the core state @xmath52 changes into a superposition of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "this decreases the total density , but in addition the @xmath142 and @xmath143 states created are now part of a singlet state which expands ballistically into the core .",
    "so , if we want to define the core to be everything that is not ballistic , we need also to remove the density contribution of the ballistic singlets in the core .",
    "thus there are two reasonable approaches in defining the core .",
    "first is that we remove everything that is ballistic ( particles and holes ) and the second is that we remove only the particles .",
    "the core expansion speeds obtained in these two ways are plotted in [ fig : expansionspeeds ] .",
    "both methods result in negative core expansion velocities as seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "using tebd we can calculate correlation functions during the expansion of the cloud .",
    "an interesting correlation function in the case of the band insulator expansion is the charge - charge correlator @xmath144 , given by    @xmath145    however , @xmath144 is dominated by single particle density correlations . to see the effect of the non - trivial correlations , we want to remove the density - density correlations from @xmath146 . if @xmath147 the density - density correlations are given by @xmath148 .",
    "when @xmath149 , @xmath150 and therefore on the diagonal the we just remove the single particle and doublon densities .",
    "therefore , the correlation function which displays the non - trivial correlations is    @xmath151    the square root of the correlator @xmath152 is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : cccorra ] and [ fig : cccorrb ] for @xmath45 at times @xmath153 . at time",
    "@xmath154 the correlator is zero everywhere .",
    "we plot the square root instead of the actual value to see better the low value regions of the correlator . while keeping @xmath155 during the time evolution in order to minimize the truncation error propagation , for the calculation of the correlators we have truncated the schmidt number to @xmath156 due to heavy numerical cost of the calculation , since for the evaluation of an observable at a given time the introduced error is negligible .",
    "our dimer picture is supported by the fact that most of the correlations arise between sites around the edges of the cloud .",
    "in addition to this , correlations arise between the wavefronts expanding in the initially free sites @xmath157 and @xmath158 and the whole initial cloud , corresponding to the stripes appearing in figs .",
    "[ fig : cccorra ] and [ fig : cccorrb ] .",
    "a similar description can be applied to the holes propagating towards the center of the cloud .",
    "this behavior reflects the intrinsically collective nature of the excitations in 1d systems .",
    "our picture of a ballistic particle leaving the cloud and a hole propagating towards the centre is complemented by this observation , which leads to the buildup of correlations between the propagating particles and the entire cloud .     for @xmath45 at @xmath159 .",

    "<S> when u is sufficiently large , the hubbard dimer oscillations occur in much shorter timescale than the single particle tunneling does . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> a large number of oscillations occur in the window @xmath69 in the case of lower interactions , hubbard dimer oscillations at frequency @xmath55 become comparable to the frequency @xmath39 and therefore we see that already the first oscillation peaks are heavily damped .     oscillations after @xmath70 , compared to the change of amplitude between the first and second oscillation peaks of @xmath71 observed in tebd numerics.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in general , the two - site dynamics is well able to describe the creation of the particle , hole , and doublon wavefronts seen in the density profiles . </S>",
    "<S> these wavefronts are created during the two - site oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results and analytical investigations confirm the two - fluid picture of the system . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the interaction takes place at the edges of the cloud , where unpaired particles are created according to the dimer dynamics described above . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent expansion is explained by dynamics of non - interacting particles ( at the speed of @xmath39 ) or doublons ( at the speed of @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our model gives an excellent quantitative description in the highly - interacting limit due to the clear separation of the expansion and dimer oscillation eigenfrequencies . </S>",
    "<S> for interactions @xmath43 the interplay between the expansion and the hubbard dimer dynamics does not allow a quantitative description of the numerical results , however it provides a qualitative framework for further analysis . for @xmath72 , </S>",
    "<S> the free - particle expansion seems to give a fairly good description .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare our results to the 2d experiment of @xcite done at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that our two - site considerations also apply to the dynamics of the experiment . in 2d </S>",
    "<S> there is coupling to four adjacent sites , but just like in 1d , initially the sites are either pauli blocked or empty . </S>",
    "<S> the simplified dynamics should originate from the two - site analysis , and subsequent short - time dynamics in the high interaction limit correspond to the two - fluid expansion , with the two fluids interacting only at the edges .    in order to compare our results to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 of @xcite we define the core density as @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the density of purely ballistic particles ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the definition of the core then corresponds to the diffusive part of the cloud in the model of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the core expansion velocity is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , @xmath80 * i )   / \\sum_{i=1}^{l}(n_{i\\ , \\uparrow}^{c } ( t ) + n_{i\\ , \\downarrow}^{c } ( t))$ ] and @xmath81 is the number of lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> the core expansion speed as a function of interaction is plotted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> we plot also the expansion speed of the whole cloud.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    another recent experiment @xcite studied collision dynamics of two fermi gas clouds . </S>",
    "<S> although the experiment is not done in a lattice , the theoretical framework presented here can in the low density limit be used to desribe also physics in @xcite , c.f . @xcite .    in conclusion , we studied the expansion of an interacting fermionic gas in a 1d lattice </S>",
    "<S> . we showed that the time evolution of this system can be described in terms of a two - fluid model of unpaired particles and doublons whose interplay gives rise to nontrivial dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the experimental results of @xcite can be interpreted in terms of the analysis performed here . </S>",
    "<S> our results should be widely applicable since expansion is a basic dynamics problem related to the ultracold gas experiments in particular , and to the transport properties of fermions in general .    </S>",
