    "the problem of multiple hypothesis testing in the setting of quantum channels can be formulated as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is an unknown quantum channel , but some a priori information is available , in the sense that @xmath0 is one of given channels @xmath1 , with probabilities @xmath2 .",
    "the task is to find a procedure that determines the true channel , with the greatest possible probability of success .    for quantum states ,",
    "this problem was formulated by helstrom @xcite and since then has been the subject of active research , see e.g. @xcite for an overview and further references . here , an ensemble @xmath3 is given , where @xmath4 are quantum states with prior probabilities @xmath2 , with a similar interpretation as above .",
    "a testing procedure , or a measurement , for this problem is described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath5 , defined as a collection of positive operators @xmath6 summing up to the identity operator @xmath7 . the value @xmath8 is interpreted as the probability that the procedure chooses @xmath9 while the true state is @xmath10 .",
    "the task is to maximize the average success probability @xmath11 over all povms . in the case",

    ", there is no explicit expression for the optimal povm in general , but it is known that a povm @xmath5 is optimal if and only if it satisfies @xmath15 this condition was obtained in @xcite using the methods of semidefinite programming .    in the case of quantum channels ,",
    "a most general measurement scheme is described by a triple @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an ancilla , @xmath18 a ( pure ) state on @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a povm on @xmath21 . for @xmath22 , the value @xmath23 is interpreted as the probability that @xmath24 is chosen when the true channel is @xmath25 .",
    "the average success probability is then @xmath26 the task is to maximize this value over all triples @xmath16 .",
    "it was observed @xcite that using entangled input states may give greater success probability and it was shown in @xcite that every entangled state is useful for some channel discrimination problem . however , there are situations when e.g. the maximally entangled input state does not give an optimal success probability .",
    "it is therefore important to find out whether an optimal scheme with a given input state exists .    in the broader context of generalized decision problems , conditions for existence of an optimal scheme with an input state having maximal schmidt rank",
    "were found in @xcite , a related problem was studied in @xcite . in the present paper , we show that these conditions can be obtained using the methods of semidefinite programming .",
    "such methods were already applied before in the context of discrimination of quantum channels , see @xcite . compared to these works , we are more concerned with the choice of an optimal input state .",
    "it is an easy observation that if a given scheme @xmath27 is optimal , then @xmath5 must be an optimal measurement for the ensemble @xmath28 .",
    "we show that , at least in the case that the input state is assumed to have maximal schmidt rank , the optimality condition for a channel measurement can be divided into the condition for this ensemble and an additional condition that ensures optimality of the input state .",
    "if the schmidt rank of the input state is not maximal we obtain a comparably weaker result , but show an example where the use of such an input state is required .    as an important special case",
    ", we get a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of an optimal scheme with a maximally entangled input state .",
    "if this condition is not fulfilled , we give an upper bound on the optimal success probability . for discrimination of two channels , we use the known form of an optimal povm for two states to obtain a relatively simple condition in terms of choi matrices of the involved channels , which we call the condition .",
    "we also derive an upper bound on the diamond norm , which is tighter than the previously known bound given e.g. in @xcite , see remark [ rem : bounds ] below .",
    "the results are applied to discrimination of covariant channels , qubit channels , unitary channels and simple projective measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we rewrite the problem as a problem of sdp from which we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal solution and derive an upper bound on the optimal success probability . in section [ sec : two ] we investigate the condition and the related bounds .",

    "let us denote @xmath392 .",
    "clearly @xmath334 is a unitary matrix .",
    "it is straightforward to see , that @xmath393 so the condition becomes @xmath394 which can be written as a matrix equation of the form @xmath395    at this point we are ready to settle the case @xmath396 .",

    "the equation becomes @xmath406 which shows that some off - diagonal elements must be non - zero .",
    "putting , say , @xmath407 , the above equalities imply that also @xmath408 and all other off - diagonal elements are nonzero . from the condition @xmath409",
    ", we obtain that @xmath410 and @xmath411 , this implies that @xmath334 is of the form @xmath412 and the basis @xmath413 and @xmath414 are just cyclic permutations of each other , modulo phase change .",
    "similarly , assuming that @xmath415 , we obtain that @xmath334 is of the form @xmath416 , which is just the other possible cyclic permutation of the basis , modulo complex phase .    for the converse , it is easy to check that both @xmath412 and @xmath416 satisfy .",
