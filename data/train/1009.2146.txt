    "universality is a key concept in classical statistical mechanics and in quantum field theory . in particular , in lattice field",
    "theory numerous lattice actions yield the same universal continuum limit .",
    "it is well known that locality is vital for the viability of universality .",
    "a universality class is characterized by the space - time dimension and the symmetries of the relevant fields . in order to construct lattice theories that fall into a desired universality class ,",
    "one often imposes additional features of the corresponding classical theory on the lattice action .",
    "usually one constructs a lattice action by replacing derivatives of the continuum fields by finite differences of the lattice fields .",
    "such a discretization ensures the correct classical continuum limit .",
    "in addition , the lattice theory can then be investigated using perturbation theory .",
    "for example , for qcd it has been proved rigorously that the lattice regularization yields the same continuum limit as perturbative regularization schemes , such as dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "taking advantage of universality , and following symanzik s improvement program @xcite , one can systematically construct improved lattice actions @xcite which eliminate lattice artifacts up to a given order in the lattice spacing . at a fixed point of the renormalization group ,",
    "so - called classically perfect lattice actions have been constructed , which are free of lattice artifacts at the classical level @xcite . in particular , in asymptotically free theories , including qcd and the 2-d @xmath1 model , a classically perfect fixed point action has been constructed by solving a minimization problem . in this paper , we proceed in a very different direction . in order to test the robustness of universality , we explicitly violate classically important properties of the action , such as the classical continuum limit , the applicability of perturbation theory , or the schwarz inequality between the action and the topological charge . hence ,",
    "in contrast to symanizik s lattice actions , which may , for example , be 1-loop improved , the actions that we will study can be viewed as tree - level impaired , but they are certainly still local . as we will see , even without appropriate classical features , the lattice theory acquires the correct quantum continuum limit .",
    "this also holds in one dimension ( _ i.e. _  in quantum mechanics ) , although in this case one does usually not rely on universality . from the point of view of wilson",
    "s renormalization group applied to critical phenomena the irrelevance of classical features of a given lattice action is perhaps not too surprising .",
    "for example , it is well known that the 4-d ising model , whose classical hamiltonian does not have a meaningful continuum limit , is in the same universality class as the @xmath4 quantum field theory .",
    "we will investigate local lattice actions that are invariant against small continuous deformations of the lattice fields . such actions  which we will call _ topological lattice actions _  have infinitely many flat directions because they do not suppress small field fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", they do not have the correct classical continuum limit and perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "depending on the nature of a topological action , it may or may not obey a schwarz inequality . in this paper , we study two different types of topological lattice actions .",
    "the first one constrains the angle @xmath5 between nearest - neighbor @xmath6 spins to @xmath7 .",
    "all field configurations that satisfy this constraint have the same action value @xmath8 . besides not having the correct classical continuum limit , this lattice action violates the schwarz inequality between action and topological charge .",
    "the quantum continuum limit is reached by sending the maximally allowed angle @xmath9 to zero .",
    "patrascioiu and seiler @xcite as well as aizenman @xcite have used an action with an angle constraint to simplify the proof of the existence of a massless phase in the 2-d @xmath0 model .",
    "furthermore , patrascioiu and seiler have also used an angle - constraint action in their search for a massless phase in the 2-d @xmath1 model @xcite , while hasenbusch used the same action to argue that @xmath10 models are in the same universality class as @xmath6 models @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented numerical evidence that the action with the angle constraint falls in the same universality class as the standard action .",
    "our study will confirm these results and will extend them by studying the cut - off effects of this topological action , as well as by investigating the topological susceptibility and the correlator of the topological charge density .",
    "lattice actions with a similar constraint have also been used in @xcite , however , not with an emphasis on the topological properties of some of these actions .",
    "the second topological lattice action that we consider receives local contributions from the absolute value of the topological charge density .",
    "this action does not have the correct classical continuum limit either , but it obeys a lattice schwarz inequality .",
    "irrespective of this , as we will see , the correct quantum continuum limit is reached for both topological actions .",
    "it should be pointed out that lattice theories with topological actions are not regularizations of the topological field theories that arise in the context of string theory or conformal field theory @xcite . while those theories realize new universality classes , the theories with topological lattice actions studied here fall into standard universality classes , despite the fact that they violate basic principles of classical physics .",
    "the @xmath6 model in @xmath11 dimensions has a non - trivial topological charge @xmath12 = { { \\mathbb{z}}}$ ] .",
    "we will investigate the 1-d @xmath0 and the 2-d @xmath1 model which have topological charges in @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] , respectively .",
    "while the 1-d @xmath0 model will be studied analytically , the 2-d @xmath1 model is investigated using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the 2-d @xmath1 model can also be viewed as the @xmath15 member of the 2-d @xmath16 model family @xcite .",

    "this has motivated their detailed study beyond perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath20-vacuum physics of 4-d @xmath21 gauge theories and of 2-d @xmath16 models has been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "topological aspects of lattice @xmath16 models have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "depending on the lattice action and the lattice definition of the topological charge , the quantum continuum limit of the topological susceptibility @xmath3 , where @xmath22 is the space - time volume , may be spoiled by short - distance lattice artifacts .",
    "these so - called dislocations have topological charge @xmath23 and a minimal value of the lattice action .",
    "semi - classical arguments , which are , however , not rigorous , suggest that @xmath24 may have a power - law divergence in the quantum continuum limit @xcite .",
    "this is expected to happen in the @xmath25 model , when one uses the standard action in combination with the geometric definition of the topological charge @xcite .",
    "this problem does not arise for @xmath16 models with @xmath26 . even in the @xmath25 case",
    ", dislocations can be eliminated and the proper continuum limit of @xmath24 can be attained if one uses a modified lattice action @xcite .",
    "dislocations have also been identified in 4-d lattice yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "again , semi - classical arguments suggest that they may spoil the quantum continuum limit in @xmath27 and @xmath28 yang - mills theory , if the standard wilson action is used in combination with the geometric definition of the topological charge @xcite . as in the @xmath25 model , dislocations can be eliminated in @xmath27 and @xmath28 yang - mills theory by using an improved lattice action @xcite .",
    "the situation is more subtle in the 2-d @xmath1 ( or equivalently @xmath29 ) model . in this case ,",
    "a semi - classical calculation in the continuum already yields a divergent topological susceptibility @xmath24 even in a small space - time volume @xcite .",
    "this divergence is not caused by lattice artifacts , but is an intrinsic feature of the theory in the continuum limit .",
    "hence , one concludes that a meaningful quantum continuum limit of @xmath24 does not exist in the 2-d @xmath1 model .",
    "this is supported by a calculation of @xmath24 using a classically perfect lattice action in combination with a classically perfect topological charge @xcite , which eliminates dislocations and indeed shows no power - like divergence of the topological susceptibility .",
    "however , @xmath24 still diverges logarithmically , and thus a meaningful quantum continuum limit is not reached for this quantity . as we will see",
    ", the logarithmic divergence of @xmath24 even arises for topological actions , although in that case one might have expected a power - law divergence due to dislocations .",
    "on the other hand , the correlator of the topological charge density will turn out to have a finite continuum limit .",
    "the concepts of classical and even quantum perfect definitions of the topological charge have also been investigated analytically in the 1-d @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "in qcd , ginsparg - wilson lattice quarks @xcite obey an atiyah - singer index theorem even at finite lattice spacing @xcite . based on ginsparg - wilson lattice fermions ,",
    "unambiguous definitions of the topological susceptibility which are free of short - distance singularities have been provided @xcite .",
    "they have been used in a derivation of the witten - veneziano formula @xcite for the @xmath30-meson mass in a fully regularized non - perturbative framework @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the step scaling function is affected by lattice artifacts which  for some time  seemed not to be described by symanzik s effective theory .",
    "interestingly , a recent careful study of the lattice artifacts has shown that large logarithms arise , and that symanzik s theory does describe the lattice artifacts correctly @xcite .",

    "based on naive dimensional analysis , one would expect that @xmath175 approaches a constant in the continuum limit . while this expectation is met in 2-d @xmath16 models with @xmath176 , the @xmath29 ( or equivalently @xmath1 ) model behaves differently .",
    "the pathological behavior of @xmath24 in the 2-d @xmath1 model manifests itself already in the continuum formulation .",

    "if the relative angle between nearest - neighbor spins is smaller than @xmath188 , one can indeed show that @xmath191 . in that case",
    ", the topological charge becomes independent of the particular decomposition into triangles , and thus becomes invariant even against translations by a single lattice spacing .",
    "here we prefer to work on a triangulated quadratic ( rather than a triangular ) lattice because the definition of the step scaling function refers to a rectangular space - time volume .",
    "the geometric topological charge is undefined for a set of exceptional field configurations , which form a set of measure zero in configuration space .",
    "these exceptional configurations contain a spherical triangle that covers exactly one half of @xmath114 and thus has an area @xmath192 .",
    "the infinitesimal neighborhood of an exceptional configuration contains configurations whose topological charges differ by 1 .",
    "if the relative angle between nearest - neighbor spins is smaller than @xmath188 , exceptional configurations can not arise . when one uses the standard lattice action , exceptional configurations have a finite action . in the following subsection",
    ", we will consider a topological lattice action that constrains the relative angle between nearest - neighbor spins to a maximum value @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath193 , exceptional configurations are excluded , and  just as in the continuum  different topological sectors are then separated by infinite - action barriers .",
    "this means that the angle - constraint topological action , but not the standard action , naturally leads to a unique segmentation of configuration space into distinct topological sectors .",
    "in addition to the logarithmic ultra - violet divergence that is present in the continuum theory , in the 2-d lattice @xmath1 model @xmath24 is affected by additional short - distance artifacts .",
    "these so - called dislocations are minimal action field configurations with a non - zero topological charge . as such",
    ", they depend on both the definition of the lattice action and the definition of the lattice topological charge . using the standard lattice action in combination with the geometric definition of the lattice topological charge , the dislocations are exceptional configurations with an action @xmath194 with @xmath195 @xcite .",
    "semi - classical arguments ( which , however , are not rigorous ) suggest that the topological susceptibility should scale as @xmath196 .",
    "due to asymptotic freedom , the correlation length scales as @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the universal 1-loop coefficient of the @xmath199-function .",
    "hence , one expects a power - law divergence of the dimensionless combination @xmath200 dislocations have been eliminated in @xcite by using a classically perfect lattice action in combination with a classically perfect definition of the lattice topological charge .",
    "perfect discretizations are based on the renormalization group and eliminate cut - off effects at the classical level . in particular , one then has @xmath201 , _ i.e. _  @xmath202 .",
    "interestingly , the topological susceptibility was then found to still diverge logarithmically . from all",
    "this one concludes that @xmath24 does not have a finite continuum limit in the 2-d @xmath1 model .",
    "the situation is different in 2-d @xmath16 models with @xmath176 . while @xmath24 is still divergent in the @xmath25 model when one uses the standard lattice action in combination with the geometric definition of the topological charge ,",
    "dislocations can be suppressed by choosing a modified lattice action @xcite . for @xmath26",
    ", dislocations do not cause any problems , even when the standard action is used .",
    "similarly , in 4-d @xmath21 lattice yang - mills theories , when one uses the geometric topological charge , @xmath24 suffers from dislocations for @xmath15 and 3 , which again can be suppressed by using a modified lattice action @xcite .      in analogy to the 1-d @xmath0 and @xmath1 models ,",
    "we now investigate the 2-d @xmath1 model with a topological lattice action that constrains the relative angle of nearest - neighbor spins on a square lattice to a maximum angle @xmath9 . all configurations that violate this constraint",

    "\\pi / g^2 ) |q[\\vec e]|$ ] . since @xmath225 , the lattice schwarz inequality deviates from the one of the classical continuum theory",
    "however , the lattice theory still has the correct quantum continuum limit .",
    "although the topological susceptibility @xmath24 is logarithmically divergent in the 2-d @xmath1 model , this does not imply that the whole concept of topology is meaningless in the continuum limit .",
    "in particular , the correlation function @xmath226 of the topological charge density @xmath227,\\ ] ] whose integral over @xmath153 is @xmath24 , has a finite continuum limit for @xmath228 .",
    "analytic results for this quantity have been derived by balog and niedermaier @xcite .",
    "the correlator is negative , except at @xmath229 .",
    "up to logarithmic corrections , at short distances it has a power - law divergence proportional to @xmath230 . at @xmath229",
    "there is a positive divergent contact term .",
    "when the correlator is integrated over @xmath153 , the numerical evidence obtained in the previous subsection suggests that the power - law divergence cancels against the contact term , but a logarithmic divergence of @xmath24 persists . as shown analytically in @xcite , using ginsparg - wilson quarks ,",
    "also in qcd the corresponding short - distance power - law divergences cancel against the contact terms .",
    "a corresponding study in the large @xmath85 limit of @xmath16 models has been presented in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the point  to  time - slice correlator @xmath231 the corresponding quantity on the lattice receives contributions @xmath232 from all triangles @xmath186 in a row of plaquettes at fixed time @xmath233 .",
    "using the meron - cluster algorithm @xcite , we have constructed an improved estimator for @xmath234 , which receives cluster - intrinsic contributions only .",

    "assuming @xmath74 cut - off effects , we have extrapolated these data to the continuum limit . in figure 12 , the extrapolated data are compared with the analytic results of @xcite .",
    "finite size effects are expected to be small because we have worked at @xmath241 . at large distances , the extrapolated monte",
    "carlo data agree very well with the analytic prediction , while at short distances , @xmath242 , there are systematic deviations .",
    "we attribute these deviations to corrections to the assumed @xmath74 behavior , similar to the ones discussed before for the mass gap . in order to fully understand the cut - off effects ,",
    "an analytic analysis along the lines of @xcite , combined with numerical data closer to the continuum limit would be most welcome . keeping this in mind ,",
    "we still conclude that our current data confirm again that the topological action leads into the standard @xmath1 universality class .     of the topological charge density ( in units of @xmath243 ) as a function of @xmath244 .",

    "in particular , this shows that some topological quantities make perfect sense in the continuum limit of the 2-d @xmath1 model , despite the fact that @xmath24 is logarithmically divergent .",
    "the divergence is expected to also affect the energy density of @xmath20-vacua .",
    "still , other physical quantities like the @xmath20-dependent mass gap should have a well - defined continuum limit , which is accessible using the meron - cluster algorithm .",

    "these actions are invariant against small deformations of the fields .",
    "despite the fact that topological lattice actions do not have the correct classical continuum limit , as we have seen , they still yield the correct quantum continuum limit , irrespective of whether or not they explicitly suppress topological charges .",
    "in particular , it does not matter whether a topological action respects or violates a schwarz inequality . since",
    ", in contrast to other lattice actions , topological actions are invariant against small local deformations of the fields , one may have expected that they fall into a different universality class . however , the allowed local deformations are field - dependent and thus do not constitute a proper gauge symmetry of topological lattice models .",
    "in fact , even the standard action of a lattice @xmath6 model has a field - dependent local @xmath246 symmetry , since every spin can be rotated around the direction defined by the average of its nearest neighbors without changing the action value .",
    "since such field - dependent local symmetries do not have the status of proper gauge symmetries , they have no impact on the corresponding universality class .",
    "since topological lattice actions do not suppress small fluctuations of the fields , perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "we have seen that in one dimension topological lattice actions suffer from strong lattice artifacts of @xmath78 .",
    "this seems to contradict symanzik s effective theory , which , however , does not apply in quantum mechanics .",
    "despite the fact that lattice perturbation theory can not be applied to topological lattice actions , symanzik s effective theory , which is formulated in the continuum , still describes the lattice artifacts of the 2-d @xmath1 model with a topological lattice action .",
    "interestingly , in contrast to the 1-d case , in the 2-d @xmath1 model cut - off effects were observed to be less severe for a topological action than for the standard action , at least at practically accessible correlation lengths .",
    "our results may encourage the use of unconventional regularizations , which might be advantageous from a computational point of view .",
    "although the topological angle - constraint action does not explicitly suppress dislocations , the corresponding topological susceptibility @xmath24 seems not to suffer from power - law divergences .",
    "instead , the monte carlo data for @xmath24 are consistent with a logarithmic divergence , which already occurs in the continuum theory . the numerical results for the point  to  time - slice correlator @xmath247 of the topological charge density are consistent with the analytic predictions of @xcite .",
    "this underscores that , despite the fact that @xmath24 is logarithmically divergent , there exist topological physical quantities that have a well - defined continuum limit in the 2-d @xmath1 model . since the corresponding complex action problem can be solved using the meron - cluster algorithm , a numerical investigation of @xmath20-vacuum effects in the 2-d @xmath1 model is both feasible and physically meaningful .",
    "it is straightforward to construct topological lattice actions for abelian and non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "one may simply constrain the trace of a wilson plaquette variable by some minimal value .",
    "configurations that satisfy this constraint on all plaquettes can then be assigned a zero action value .",
    "it is conceivable that one can take algorithmic advantages from actions of this kind .",
    "it is an interesting subject for future studies to decide whether topological lattice actions may be useful in lattice yang - mills theory or in lattice qcd .",
    "our study underscores the robustness of universality , which , in particular , does not rely on classical concepts .",
    "even when one uses actions that do not have the correct classical continuum limit , can not be treated with perturbation theory , or do not obey a schwarz inequality , the emerging quantum theory still has the correct continuum limit .",
    "this means that the standard approach of starting from a classical system and then quantizing it afterwards is not the only way to define a quantum theory .",
