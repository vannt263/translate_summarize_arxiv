    "high mass protostars share many of the same observational characteristics as their low mass counterparts : outflows @xcite , jets @xcite , envelopes @xcite and possibly disks @xcite . however , the elevated radiation environment that accompanies high mass stars raises the question as to what degree high mass star formation is merely a scaled version of low mass star formation . answering",
    "that question is not straightforward , partly because high mass star forming regions are less common than the low mass counterparts , and tend to be more distant .",
    "the greater distance , coupled with the propensity of hmpos to form in clusters and the disruptive influence of jets , outflows and regions , complicates interpretation of the observations @xcite .",

    "more recently , surveys with the _ spitzer _ space telescope such as glimpse @xcite have identified hmpos based on mid - infrared colors @xcite .",

    "the brightest 3 mm continuum source detected in each map is located within 6  of the centroid of the larger scale core traced by single dish 1.2 mm continuum emission as measured by @xcite .",
    "given the 11  resolution of the 1.2 mm observations and the difficulty in finding the exact center of non - symmetric intensity distributions , the offsets between the 3 mm and 1.2 mm positions are most likely not significant .",
    "we detect 95ghz  emission toward five hmpos .",
    "two of the sources ( iras 23033 + 5951 and iras 23151 + 5912 ) have a single emission detection , and three ( iras 18517 + 0437 , iras 20126 + 4104 and iras 23139 + 5939 ) have multiple detections .",
    "spectra for each of the detections are shown in figure  [ spectraplots ] , and spectral parameters are summarized in table  [ methprop ] .",
    "the 95ghz lines are bright ( with brightness temperatures around a few hundred kelvin ) , narrow ( unresolved at 1.6  resolution ) and spatially unresolved . therefore the inferred brightness temperatures are lower limits and the lines are likely to be masing .",

    "the projected spatial offsets are consistent with the expectation that the 95ghz masers are collisionally pumped at the interface between outflows and the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "all of the  lines are found within 2of the systemic velocity of the hmpo , implying that the masers form in the colliding gas .",
    "our finding that the maser line is found at nearly the same velocity as the ambient medium is consistent with the results of @xcite , who find that this maser line is often , but not always , at the systemic velocity of the hmpo .",

    "six of the seven carma 3 mm continuum detections ( all except iras 18517 + 0437 ) were included in an interferometric survey of 22ghz  and 6.7ghz  masers by @xcite .",
    "water masers have been identified toward all six cores detected with carma , and three of these cores also have 6.7ghz  masers .",
    "for hmpos with both 22  ghz  and 6.7  ghz  masers , the two types of masers are spatially coincident to within 1 - 2 .",
    "both types of masers also fall within @xmath41  of our 3 mm continuum positions , as shown in figure  [ contourplots ] . of the multiple 3 mm components resolved in iras 19217 + 1651 and iras 23033 + 5951 ,",

    "four of ten 3 mm continuum sources are located within 1  of a 3.6 cm radio continuum source .",
    "the 3 mm continuum emission for these objects may originate from free - free or thermal dust emission . if we assume that the sources in our sample are typical of other uchii regions , the free - free emission will be optically thick ( i.e. @xmath22 ) for @xmath23ghz , and optically thin ( @xmath24 ) for higher frequencies @xcite . for a `` typical '' uchii radio continuum spectrum , the expected 3 mm continuum flux density from free - free emission will be less than a factor of 2.7 higher than the 3.6 cm flux density .",

    "the hmpo iras 23139 + 5939 has a flux density of 1.4 mjy at 3.6 cm @xcite , so we assume that the free - free emission contributes no more than 3.8 mjy of the @xmath29 mjy detected with carma at 3 mm . for regions without 3.6 cm emission , we assume that dust accounts for all of the observed 3 mm flux density .",
    "we derive the total ( gas and dust ) mass for each of the carma continuum detections from the observed 3 mm flux density , assuming optically thin emission from isothermal dust , using the equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the integrated flux density , @xmath32 is the fraction of 3 mm emission from dust , @xmath33 is the distance , @xmath34 is the dust emissivity and @xmath35 is the planck function .",

    "the mass can be derived as @xmath41 where we use the rayleigh - jeans approximation to the planck function and assume a temperature of 50k . since the 3 mm continuum emitting regions are not resolved by our observations , a lower limit on the volume density is derived assuming spherical geometry with a diameter equal to the resolution and a mean molecular weight per free particle of 2.37 .",
    "estimated masses and densities for the individual 3 mm continuum sources are summarized in table  [ obsprop ] .",

    "can be compared to the large scale core traced by single dish 1.2 mm continuum maps @xcite .",
    "assuming that the large scale core and the compact clumps have the same temperature and dust emissivity , we find that the compact 3 mm sources contain @xmath420% of the total core mass , and have volume densities that are larger by a factor of @xmath41000 than the average core density .",
    "all 14 hmpo candidates in our sample were observed by @xcite with the cso or iram 30  m telescopes to measure the co ( 21 ) line profile .",
    "all were seen to have broad - line wings consistent with bipolar outflows , suggesting that outflow activity is common in these high - mass star forming regions .",

    "there are at least two outflows , identified by sio ( 21 ) and ( 87 ) emission , in this region , one oriented roughly w - e and the other n - s @xcite .",
    "the outflows are likely driven by two protostars , and it is not clear if the 3  mm continuum emission detected with carma corresponds to one or both protostars , or if the 95  ghz  maser is related to the interaction between the w - e outflow and the ambient medium .",
    "one proposed evolutionary sequence for hmpos is that they originate from low or intermediate mass protostars that are accreting material from the surrounding core , presumably via a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "as the protostar increases in mass , an  region ultimately forms that eventually expands and halts accretion . while it is unclear if  or 6.7ghz  masers originate from the disk or outflow , the observational evidence suggests these masers trace an early stage of evolution before the  region has expanded significantly @xcite . in this scenario , a young hmpo with an accretion disk would be identified by its water and/or methanol masers and mm - wavelength thermal emission from the dust around the protostar . when the hmpo is `` intermediate aged ''",
    ", an uchii region detectable with cm - wavelength continuum emission would grow but will not immediately disrupt the accretion , so masers and dust thermal emission would also be present . as the uchii region expands , it will destroy the disk and cut off the masers .",
    "we now evaluate whether or not the carma observations are consistent with this evolutionary sequence .",
    "first , we discuss if the compact sources detected in the carma 3 mm continuum maps signify the presence of a high mass protostar .",
    "the masses of the compact sources range between 21 and 1200contained within a region @xmath4510,000au in diameter .",
    "thus these compact 3 mm continuum sources are substantially denser and more massive than the dense cores found in nearby clouds known to be forming low mass stars .",
    "even if we assume only 10% of the core mass forms into a star , a mid b - type star can potentially form in these cores . moreover , four of the 3 mm continuum sources are spatially coincident with compact  regions , confirming directly the presence of a high mass star . therefore",
    ", we assume that all of the compact 3 mm continuum sources represent dense dust and gas surrounding a high mass star or protostar .",
    "we can not determine if the material is distributed in a disk or compact envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , as the dust continuum emission is unresolved by these observations .",
    "since 3 mm continuum emission is detected toward 7 of the 14 hmpos in our survey we investigate whether the 50% detection rate is set by physical differences between the high mass cores or by selection bias .",
    "a bias may be introduced since the hmpos span a factor of @xmath46 in distance and a factor of @xmath410 in luminosity , but the sensitivity in each of the carma maps is approximately the same . in the top panel of figure [ distnoisepeak ] , we plot the noise in the carma 3 mm continuum maps as a function of the distance to the hmpo for sources with ( black circles ) and without ( gray circles ) carma continuum detections .",
    "no clear differences in the noise characteristics or source distances are found between the two samples .",
    "the middle panel shows the core masses derived from single dish 1.2 mm continuum maps versus the bolometric luminosity of the core .",
    "again , sources with and without 3 mm carma continuum detections share similar distributions , indicating that the carma observations did not preferentially detect cores with the highest mass or luminosity .",
    "finally , the bottom panel in figure [ distnoisepeak ] shows how the peak flux density in the mambo single dish 1.2 mm continuum maps varies with the integrated 1.2 mm flux density .",
    "we detect ( at the @xmath46 level ) 3 mm continuum emission from all seven of the hmpos with 1.2 mm peak fluxes above 300 mjy/(11)@xmath47 , while none of the seven hmpos below that threshold are detected .",
    "is there an observational bias for detecting only those sources with the highest peak surface brightnesses at 1.2 mm , or is there an intrinsic difference between those cores above and below the 300 mjy / beam threshold ?",
    "the peak 1.2 mm flux densities in our sample are all @xmath48 100 mjy / beam . if the 1.2 mm flux density in the 11  single dish beam originates from an unresolved disk or envelope , we would expect to observe flux densities of @xmath484 mjy / beam at 3 mm assuming an emissivity spectral index of @xmath49 , which is appropriate for disks @xcite .",
    "the noise in the 3 mm continuum maps is approximately 1 mjy / beam , and all 14 hmpo candidates would be detectable at @xmath50 level if the central emission were compact .",
    "given that all 14 hmpo candidates could have been detected with carma , we consider whether differences in the carma 3 mm continuum detection rate versus peak 1.2 mm flux density could be explained by the presence or absence of an unresolved disk or envelope .",
    "the median integrated 3 mm flux density detected with carma is 10mjy , which , assuming an emissivity spectral index of @xmath51 , would contribute @xmath4180mjy / beam of emission at 1.2 mm .",
    "this is approximately equal to the difference between the peak 1.2 mm flux densities of the faintest hmpos detected by carma ( @xmath4 400  mjy / beam @ 1.2 mm ) and the brightest hmpos not detected with carma ( @xmath4 250 mjy / beam ) .",
    "thus the lack of carma detections around sources with low peak 1.2 mm flux densities , but otherwise large integrated 1.2 mm flux densities and far - infrared luminosities , may indicate that a compact disk or envelope has dissipated around these sources .",
    "since the detection rate of 3 mm sources is not strongly biased by the range of distances , masses and luminosities in our sample , we investigate if the evolutionary stage correlates with the detection rate of compact 3 mm sources .",
    "the signposts of the age sequence that we are testing , in order of increasing age , are : ( 1 ) presence of 6.7ghz  and/or 22ghz  maser emission and no cm continuum emission , ( 2 ) both maser and cm continuum emission , and ( 3 ) cm continuum emission but an absence of masers @xcite . for each of the 14 massive cores in our survey",
    ", we list the presence of 3 mm continuum , cm continuum , and maser emission in table [ detections ] .",
    "we detect 3 mm continuum emission from 3/5 of the `` youngest '' hmpos , 4/5 of the `` intermediate '' aged hmpos and 0/4 of the `` oldest '' hmpos .",
    "thus , the 3 mm continuum emission is preferentially detected toward the sources with maser emission , consistent with the proposed evolutionary sequence for high mass stars .",
    "further , we would expect that the  masers and the 6.7ghz  masers to be nearly coincident with the compact 3 mm sources , since vlbi observations suggest that these masers originate from shocks associated with winds or jets near the base of the molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "all thirteen  masers with interferometric positions , and five of the eight 6.7ghz  masers , are in fact located within 1.5  of a compact 3 mm continuum source .",
    "it is possible that the  maser sources without associated 3 mm continuum emission may have too low of disk or envelope mass to be detected in our observations .    in summary ,",
    "all of the  and most of the 6.7ghz  maser emission appear to be related to massive disks or envelopes , but these disks / envelopes are not present toward sources that have radio continuum emission but no maser emission .",
    "the probability of association between hmpos with 3  mm continuum emission and hmpos with 22  ghz  masers and 6.7  ghz  masers is 98% and 71% , respectively .",
    "these 3  mm continuum sources are also likely to be driving outflows , and there is a 98% likelihood that 3  mm continuum emission is associated with two possible outflow tracers , sio ( 21 ) emission and 95  ghz  masers . there is a 99.8% likelihood of association between these two spectral lines .",
    "these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that as an  region around a high mass protostar expands , it destroys the surrounding disk and envelope , and consequently shuts off the source of the outflows and  and  masers .",
    "in this paper we tested the hypothesis that  and  masers are signposts of an early phase in the evolution of a high mass protostellar object before an expanding uchii region has destroyed the accretion disk .",
    "we used carma to observe the 3 mm continuum emission at 1  resolution around a sample of hmpos with and without masers and cm continuum emission .",
    "we also observed the 95ghz line to determine its association with the thermal emission from dust surrounding the protostars .",
    "we detect ( at @xmath46 significance ) 3 mm continuum emission from all seven hmpos with mambo 1.2 mm continuum peak fluxes ( taken from beuther et al .",
    "2002a ) above 300 mjy/(11)@xmath47 , while none of the seven hmpos with peak fluxes below this threshold were detected in our survey .",
    "we argue that this is not merely an observational selection effect , because all 14 hmpo candidates could have been detected in the carma maps if their 1.2 mm peak fluxes originated from disks or compact envelopes , and were therefore concentrated into the @xmath41  carma beam .",
    "the detection rate of hmpos at 3 mm is not correlated with distance to the hmpo , the 1.2 mm integrated flux detected with mambo , the total luminosity of the hmpo or its mass ( see figure  [ distnoisepeak ] ) .",
    "all seven hmpos detected at 3 mm are associated with  masers , and only two of the seven hmpos not detected at 3 mm are associated with  masers .",
    "the 22ghz  masers and 95ghz lines are significantly ( 98% probability ) associated with the detection rate of 3 mm continuum emission .",
    "there is no significant association between the detection rate of 3 mm continuum and 6.7ghz  or 1.7ghz oh masers or cm continuum emission .",
    "the presence of sio ( 21 ) emission in the study of @xcite was also a useful predictor of carma 3  mm continuum detections ( 98% probability ) and 95  ghz  masers ( 99.8% probability ) .",
    "the general picture of the evolution of high - mass protostars is consistent with our observations that the 3 mm continuum emission comes from a disk and/or compact envelope around an hmpo .",
    "our observations suggest that  masers are associated with these disks / envelopes , and that they are present both prior to and during the formation of an uchii region . when the uchii region disrupts the disk and compact envelope around the hmpo , the  and 95ghz  masers are likely to be cut off and the 3 mm continuum emission falls below our threshold of detectability .",
    "we thank the referee for improving the clarity and increasing the scope of this paper .",
    "we thank the carma staff , students and postdocs for their help in making these observations .",
