    "it is common to define pdrs as regions where stellar far ultraviolett ( fuv : 6  ev@xmath0 13.6  ev ) radiation dominates the physical and chemical properties of the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "fuv radiation is predominantely produced in massive stars , which do not live long enough to exit their parental cloud of gas and dust within their lifetime .",
    "pdrs are the products of the strong mutual feedback between young massive stars and their parental clouds and hence closely related to the process of star formation ( sf ) .",
    "metallicity ( @xmath1 ) is thought to affect the fragmentation properties of gravitationally unstable gas , especially in the early universe ( bromm _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; schneider _ et al . _",
    "this should also affect the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "however , jappsen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown , that the cooling of hot , very low-@xmath1 gas does not seem not to depend on metallicity , since it is dominated by h@xmath2 cooling .",
    "hence , the cooling depends on the amount of h@xmath2 available for cooling , which might still be a function of metallicity due to the fact that molecular hydrogen is formed on metallic surfaces , i.e. dust .",
    "figure  [ influence ] lists the most prominent metallicity effects .",
    "an altered metallicity affects the physics ( primarily energy balance and radiative transfer ) and the chemistry of pdrs .",
    "the most important , direct effects are altered elemental abundances leading to a different chemical structure and different total column densities of important species like c@xmath3 , c , and co as well as an altered dust - to - gas ratio @xmath4 .",
    "a lower @xmath4 leads to a weaker attenuation and fuv radiation penetrates deeper into the cloud , destroying fragile molecule up to larger depths . additionally , gas heating by fuv photons can act deeper in the cloud leading to a different temperature structure compared to solar metallicity pdrs . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability for a photon to escape the cloud is increased , improving the cooling efficiency at any particular depth while the smaller elemental abundance reduces the cooling rate .",
    "observations of low metallicity environments also confirm that the dust composition changes at lower @xmath1 .",
    "the pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) fraction drops significantly ( draine _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , madden _ et al . _",
    "pahs dominantly contribute to the total photoelectric heating ( pe ) efficiency , thus , at lower values of @xmath1 the pe efficiency is significantly diminished .",
    "_ @xcite also showed , that the spectral shape of the fuv radiation is different in low @xmath1 dwarf galaxies .",
    "reduced metallicities lead , for a given stellar type , to hotter main sequence temperatures and to harder , i.e. more energetic , spectral seds .",
    "this may affect the dust composition via evaporation and photodissociation processes and leads to a different pe efficiency .",
    "since all these effects are non - linear and mutually coupled it is very difficult to give an analytical solution and one has to rely on numerical computations .",
    "sometimes the results are completely counter - intuitive like displayed in figure  [ invertedt ] .",
    "the heating and cooling efficiencies at the cloud surface depend on parameters like density @xmath5 , metallicity and fuv intensity @xmath6 . with increasing fuv intensities and densities above @xmath7  @xmath8 , the dominant heating contribution shifts from h@xmath2-deexcitation to photoelectric ( pe ) heating ( c.f .",
    "_ @xcite ) . since @xmath9 is much less effective for @xmath10 compared to the cooling terms , which scale linearly with @xmath1 , the gas temperature drops if @xmath6 increases , i.e. if we move closer to the fuv source !",
    "vice versa this means , a hypothetical cloud gets hotter the further away it is placed from a strong fuv source . even though this might be an academic example due to its particular assumptions , it demonstrates the difficulty in predicting metallicity effects .",
    "an inversion occurs , i.e. the surface temperature drops for an intenser fuv illumination . ]",
    "the model results presented here are computed with the kosma-@xmath11 pdr code .",
    "( stoerzer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , rllig _ et al . _",
    "this code features spherical geometry and an isotropical fuv irradiation .",
    "it calculates the chemical and physical cloud structure as function of radius as well as the total cloud emission .",
    "the metallicity is a free model parameter and changes the elemental abundances and the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the chemical network in kosma-@xmath11 is fully modular and individual species can be easily added to or removed from the network .",
    "recently , the code has been expanded to calculate the dust temperatures and continuum emission for any given dust distribution ( rllig & szczerba @xcite ) .",
