    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most promising scenarios of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and predicts new particles observable at the present or next generation of colliders .",
    "it solves the naturalness problem by taming the otherwise quadratically divergent quantum correction to the higgs boson mass , makes the three gauge forces unify , and opens up a way to ultimate unification of all the fundamental interactions including gravity @xcite .",
    "if susy is the case , we will be able to probe physics at the unification scale by studying its breaking pattern through various measurements of susy particles some of which will have been discovered at the tevatron or the lhc .",
    "one of primary goals for an international linear collider ( ilc ) is hence determination of susy or susy - breaking parameters through precision measurements of masses and couplings of those susy particles .",
    "the pair production of lighter charginos ( @xmath7 ) is one of the most important processes in this respect since the @xmath3  is relatively light in most of the parameter space and hence expected to be studied in the early stage of the ilc project .",
    "measurements of its mass and couplings at the ilc have not only been discussed but , for some typical sets of susy(-breaking ) parameters , also simulated in detail  @xcite .",
    "all of the cases studied in the past , however , assume that the lighter chargino would decay directly into a final state containing the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is the lightest neutralino ( @xmath6 ) in most of the susy parameter space . at large @xmath1  values , however , @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing might generate a large mass splitting between @xmath10and the other sleptons ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , yielding a particular mass hierarchy of @xmath15 . if @xmath16 is gaugino - like , this means that the @xmath3 will decay at 100% of the times in the cascade mode : @xmath17   followed by @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the experimental signature of the chargino pair production will be an acoplanar @xmath18 pair with significant missing energy carried away not only by the lsp s from the @xmath2 decays but also by the final - state neutrinos from the @xmath3  and @xmath18 decays .",
    "this would make it significantly more difficult to determine the chargino mass .",
    "this paper describes results from our simulation studies of the pair production of the lighter charginos and their subsequent cascade decays : @xmath19 in a particular scenario of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , where @xmath20  gev/@xmath21  and @xmath22  gev/@xmath21  as in refs .",
    "it should be noted that signals from the @xmath23-@xmath3   co - annihilation region are recently of great interest .",
    "the region is characterized by a difference in the @xmath23   mass and the lightest neutralino mass of about 5 - 15 gev/@xmath21 .",
    "this small mass difference allows the @xmath23   to co - annihilate in the early universe along with the neutralinos in order to produce the current amount of cold dark matter density of the universe measured by wmap  @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental signature is very challenging",
    ". we will not address this signature , because it requires to detect electron / positron from two - photon process in the forward region .",
    "thus it requires a different optimization of the event selection criteria  @xcite .",
    "in simulating the signal and various background events , we use the helas library  @xcite to calculate the helicity amplitudes , the bases / spring package  @xcite to generate the final - state partons , and tauola  @xcite to decay the final - state @xmath18 leptons if any , so as to take into account possible spin correlations of intermediate heavy partons , effects of beamstrahlung and subsequent beam - energy spread  @xcite , and finite @xmath18 polarizations .",
    "the generated events are then processed through a fast simulator of a detector model  @xcite , which includes a central tracker , electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters , and muon drift chambers .",
    "this simulator smears charged - track parameters in the central tracker with parameter correlation properly taken into account , and simulates calorimeter signals as from individual segments .",
    "although @xmath18  polarization varies in general with the susy parameters and would thus influence the property of the final states , we fix the @xmath18  polarization for the signal process at the nominal value of 0.026 for simplicity .    for susy events ,",
    "we choose our reference susy point to have @xmath24 , @xmath25  gev , m@xmath26  gev , and m@xmath27 = 180.0 gev , where @xmath28 , m@xmath29 , and m@xmath27  are the higgsino mixing mass , universal scalar mass at gut scale , and su(2)@xmath30  gaugino mass parameters , respectively .",
    "we take m@xmath31  so that it satisfies gut relation m@xmath32m@xmath27 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath33  gev/@xmath21  ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "notice that @xmath37  is the next to the lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) and decays to @xmath38 at 100% of the time .",
    "we assume in what follows that @xmath39  and @xmath40   will have been measured below the threshold of chargino pair production , say at @xmath41 = 310 gev , with uncertainties expected for @xmath42  @xcite . in order to evaluate to what extent we can determine the chargino mass in this setting",
    ", we then vary the @xmath3  mass around 171.0 gev/@xmath21 , while keeping the @xmath2 and @xmath6 masses unchanged , by appropriately adjusting the values of susy(-breaking ) parameters   gaugino mass parameters ( m@xmath43 and m@xmath44 ) that has been assumed for our reference point . ] and see how the observable distributions respond to the change .    as for the ilc parameters , we assume @xmath45  gev , @xmath46 , and an electron beam polarization of @xmath47  ( left handed ) .",
    "the @xmath48  production cross section at @xmath47  is 20 times larger than that at @xmath49  ( right handed ) .",
    "furthermore , it can suppress the cross section for the @xmath50 process that yields almost the same final states as our signal process .",
    "in our setting , the chargino pair production results in a final state consisting of a @xmath18-pair with large missing energy .",
    "the five major backgrounds for the signal event are considered : ( i ) @xmath37-pair production : @xmath51 , ( ii ) neutralino pair production : @xmath52 , ( iii ) diboson production : @xmath53 , @xmath54  ( @xmath55 ) or @xmath56 , ( iv ) single boson production : @xmath57 and @xmath58  with @xmath59  or @xmath60 , and ( v ) two - photon @xmath18-pair production : @xmath61 . as for the neutralino pair production , the su(2)@xmath30   relation between @xmath62  and @xmath3  masses is assumed .",
    "we also assume the @xmath62  mass is measured via other processes such as @xmath63 .",
    "we ignore the uncertainty in the @xmath62  mass measurement , because the effect in @xmath3  mass measurement is found to be negligible .",
    "mass determination accuracy is estimated to be @xmath64  gev/@xmath21 if the @xmath62 mass fluctuation is @xmath65  gev/@xmath21 . ]",
    "notice that the cross section times branching fraction for @xmath66-pair production followed by @xmath67 decays is , for instance , eight times higher than that of the signal at our susy reference point .",
    "we had thus better avoid events with purely leptonic @xmath18 decays .",
    "notice also that the two @xmath18-jets   decay will hereafter be called a @xmath18-jet even if it contains only one charged particle . ] in the susy events are likely to be more acoplanar than those from the sm backgrounds .",
    "these observations lead us to the following selection criteria to improve signal - to - background ratio :    there should be no @xmath68  candidates positively identified in the detector simulator ;    jet clustering has to yield two jets with @xmath69   for @xmath70  @xcite ;    @xmath71 , where @xmath72  and @xmath73  are the charge and the momentum of @xmath74-th jet with @xmath74 = 1(2 ) corresponding to the higher ( lower ) energy jet ;    @xmath75gev/@xmath21 ;    the missing transverse momentum @xmath76gev/@xmath77 ;    @xmath78  or @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81  is the visible momentum vector calculated with both tracker and calorimeter information ;    thrust @xmath82 ;    acoplanarity angle @xmath83 @xmath84 .",
    "cut ( f ) effectively rejects the @xmath85  background , because the @xmath18 lepton from @xmath86  tends to go in the parent @xmath66-boson momentum direction .",
    "we tabulate the resultant selection efficiencies after each cut for the signal and the background processes at the reference susy point in table  [ tab : eventsel ] .",
    "total selection efficiency ( @xmath87 ) for the @xmath88  signal at the reference point is @xmath89 .",
    "we see that the selection criteria are effective at suppressing the sm backgrounds , yielding a signal - to - background ratio of 1.7 .    lrrrrrrrr process & @xmath48 & @xmath90 & @xmath91 & @xmath92 & @xmath93 & @xmath94 & @xmath95 & + & ( ref . ) & ( ref . ) & ( ref . ) & & & & & @xmath96 + @xmath97 ( fb ) ( @xmath47 ) & 322 & 78 & 44 & 2304 & 83.6 & 1876 & 92.8 & 5.62@xmath98 + ( a )  @xmath68  removal & 0.403 & 0.424 & 0.398 & 0.0747 & 0.0623 & @xmath99 & 0.0437 & @xmath100 + ( b )  n@xmath101 = 2 & 0.351 & 0.308 & 0.348 & 0.0392 & 0.0522 & @xmath102 & 0.0377 & @xmath103 + ( c )  jet angle cut & 0.240 & 0.218 & 0.251 & 0.0122 & 0.0255 & @xmath104 & 0.0239 & @xmath105 + ( d )  @xmath106 gev/@xmath21 & 0.220 & 0.187 & 0.238 & 0.0118 & 0.0229 & @xmath107 & 0.0232 & @xmath105 + ( e )  @xmath108 gev/@xmath77 & 0.182 & 0.147 & 0.198 & 0.0085 & 0.0208 & @xmath109 & 0.0178 & @xmath110 + ( f )  @xmath111 or & & & & & & & +  @xmath112 & 0.175 & 0.142 & 0.185 & 0.0054 & 0.0200 & @xmath113 & 0.0161 & @xmath114 + ( g )  thrust @xmath115 & 0.173 & 0.141 & 0.172 & 0.0043 & 0.0200 & @xmath116 & 0.0160 & @xmath117 + ( h )  acoplanarity @xmath118 & 0.158 & 0.137 & 0.158 & 0.0031 & 0.0186 & @xmath119 & 0.0136 & @xmath120 + @xmath87 & 0.158 & 0.137 & 0.158 & 0.0031 & 0.0186 & @xmath119 & 0.0136 & @xmath121 + ( generated events ) & 0.4 m & 0.4 m & 0.6 m & 1 m & 1 m & 1.4 m & 1 m & 8 m + # of expected events & & & & & & & + for @xmath122 = 200 fb@xmath123 & 10175 & 2137 & 1390 & 1428 & 311 & 34 & 252 & 315 +   +    as for the @xmath124  event where quark jets are mis - identified as @xmath18-jets , the total selection efficiency is small ( less than @xmath125 ) and the expected number of the @xmath124  events is 2.5 . we do not include this process in table  [ tab : eventsel ] . we also show the signal selection efficiencies for different chargino masses in table  [ tab : eventsel1 ] .",

    "if @xmath6  and @xmath2 masses are predetermined , the @xmath18-jet energy distribution can be used to determine the @xmath3  mass , since the shape of the distribution , especially around the endpoint , depends on @xmath130 . as @xmath130 increases , the peak of the distribution shifts to the higher energy side , while the endpoint moves to the lower energy side .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : final2 ] , which plots the @xmath18-jet energy distributions for various @xmath130  values .    in order to determine the chargino mass using the @xmath18-jet energy distribution , we first prepare a parametrized @xmath18-jet energy distribution ( a template ) as a function of @xmath131 in the following manner : ( i ) the @xmath18-jet energy distribution , including the backgrounds , is fit to a polynomial function by minuit  @xcite for each of high statistics samples with different @xmath3  masses ; ( ii ) the fitting parameters are then parametrized as a function of @xmath131 . although the @xmath18-jet energy distribution may depend on the remaining free parameters such as @xmath14  mass , @xmath28  parameter , and @xmath18  polarization , those are fixed in the present study .",
    "we then compare the @xmath18-jet energy distribution for a monte carlo sample corresponding to 200 fb@xmath123  with the template and calculate @xmath132 .",
    "figure  [ fig : delw1ss ] shows @xmath133  for the reference point ( @xmath34  = 171.0 gev/@xmath21 ) .",
    "the fitted value of the @xmath3  mass is @xmath134  gev/@xmath21 .",
    "this is about 1@xmath97  off the reference mass of 171.0 gev/@xmath21 .",
    "we prepare approximately 100 statistically independent samples of @xmath135  and @xmath136  events for the reference point .",
    "each sample is also corresponding to 200 fb@xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath132fitting procedure provides consistently a @xmath137  uncertainty of @xmath138  gev/@xmath21  for each sample .",
    "however the fluctuation of @xmath3  mass at the @xmath139  is @xmath140  gev/@xmath21  around the @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we assign the total uncertainty in the @xmath3  mass measurement to be @xmath141  gev/@xmath21  ( quadratic sum of two sources ) .    the above estimate ignores the uncertainties in the input @xmath2  and @xmath6  masses .",
    "these uncertainties will affect the accuracy in the @xmath3  mass measurement , because the differences between @xmath2 , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 masses determine the shape of @xmath18-jet energy distribution .",
    "the higher endpoint , in particular , depends on the difference ( @xmath130 ) between @xmath2  and @xmath3  masses . in order to evaluate the impact of the uncertainties on the @xmath3 mass determination , we repeat the study for @xmath142 , varying @xmath143  and @xmath144 .",
    "figure  [ fig : contchi ] shows a contour plot of @xmath145 in the @xmath143  - @xmath144  plane .",
    "the center point of each @xmath146  contour is at @xmath147  and @xmath148 .",
    "the contours clearly demonstrate a strong positive correlation between @xmath144 and @xmath143 , implying that the shape of the @xmath18-jet energy distribution is mainly controlled by their difference , as long as the @xmath3 mass is fixed .",
    "it is worth noting that the smallest ellipse , which is the expected 1@xmath97 bound from the @xmath2-pair production study with 100  fb@xmath123 cited from ref .",
    "@xcite , has a quite similar correlation and is well contained in the contour corresponding to @xmath149 .",
    "the aforementioned expected accuracy of @xmath141  gev/@xmath150 for the @xmath3 mass will hence essentially be unaffected by the inclusion of the uncertainties in the @xmath6 and @xmath2 masses from the lower energy @xmath2-pair study .",
    "the production cross section times branching ratio is experimentally estimated by @xmath151 , where @xmath152  is the number of observed events , @xmath153   the number of expected background events , @xmath154 the integrated luminosity , and @xmath87  the selection efficiency .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath87  weakly depends on @xmath131  as shown in table  [ tab : eventsel1 ] : the efficiency varies by only 0.6% over the mass range of @xmath155   gev/@xmath21 from @xmath34 .",
    "this implies the possibility of extracting the cross section times branching fraction ( @xmath156  fb ) independently of the input @xmath3   mass , provided that @xmath157  fb@xmath123 ( the luminosity is assumed to be measured with an uncertainty of 1%  @xcite ) , @xmath158  events ( the background contribution is fully estimated ) , and @xmath159   ( the uncertainty includes the weak dependence of @xmath87   on @xmath131 ) .",
    "this indicates that we can determine the production cross section times branching fraction to an accuracy of 2% even without any precise @xmath131  study .",
    "at large @xmath1 values , the @xmath2  mass might be lighter than the @xmath3  mass within the mssm framework . in this case",
    ", the @xmath17  decay will be dominant and that will be followed by @xmath160 .",
    "we have thus studied the final state consisting of @xmath161  + large missing energy as a possible signature of the chargino pair production at a future @xmath162   linear collider .",
    "we proposed to use the @xmath18-jet energy distribution to measure the @xmath3  mass in the large @xmath1  scenario .",
    "since this scenario leads @xmath6  and @xmath2  masses to be lighter than @xmath3  mass and opens the @xmath2  pair production mode with lower energy of @xmath3  pair production , the @xmath6  and @xmath2   masses are likely to be determined in the lower @xmath3  production threshold energy operation of the collider .",
    "the measurements of 171  gev/@xmath150  chargino could then be made with an accuracy better than 1  gev/@xmath150 , provided that the @xmath6  and @xmath2  masses will have been determined through a @xmath2-pair production study with 100  fb@xmath123 .",
    "since the event selection efficiency does not significantly depend on the @xmath3  mass , the uncertainty in the production cross section shall be dominated by uncertainties in the selection efficiency and the luminosity measurement .",
    "we expect to determine the cross section to an accuracy of 2% at the reference point despite the cascade decay mode .",
