    "recently , there is considerable interest in the parametric pumping@xcite .",
    "the parametric pump is facilitated by cyclic variations of pumping potentials inside the scattering system and has been realized experimentally by switkes et al@xcite .",
    "on theoretical side , much progress has been made towards understanding of various features related to the parametric pump .",
    "this includes quantization of pumped charge@xcite , the influence of discrete spatial symmetries and magnetic field@xcite , the rectification of displacement current@xcite , as well as the inelastic scattering@xcite to the pumped current .",
    "the concept of optimal pump has been proposed with the lower bound for the dissipation derived@xcite . within the formalism of time - dependent scattering matrix theory , the heat current and shot noise in the pumping process@xcite",
    "has also been discussed .",
    "recently , the original adiabatic pumping theory has been extended to account for the effect due to finite frequency@xcite , andreev reflection in the presence of superconducting lead@xcite , and strong electron interaction in the kondo regime@xcite .",
    "this gives us more physical insight of parametric pumping .",
    "for instance , the experimental observed anomaly of pumped current at @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be explained using finite frequency theory@xcite as due to the quantum interference of different photon assisted processes . when superconducting lead is present , the interference between the direct reflection and multiple andreev reflection gives rise to an enhancement of pumped current which is four times of that of normal system@xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to further extend the parametric theory to the case where the ferromagnetic leads are present . with the theory extended , many new physics are foreseen@xcite which may lead to new operational paradigms for future spintronic devices@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a parametric pumping theory for a nonmagnetic system with two ferromagnetic leads whose magnetic moments orient at an angle @xmath0 with respect to each other .",
    "our theory is based on nonequilibrium green s function approach and focused on current perpendicular to plane geometry .",
    "parametric pump generates current at zero external bias .",
    "it would be interesting to see the interplay of the role played by pumping potential and external bias if the leads are maintain at different chemical potential@xcite .",
    "hence in our theory , the external bias is also included . in the adiabatic regime ,",
    "the pumped current is proportional to pumping frequency . in this regime , we have derived the parametric pumping theory for finite pumping amplitude . at the finite pumping frequency ,",
    "the system is away from equilibrium , we have performed perturbation up to the second order in pumping amplitude and obtained the pumped current at finite frequencies .",
    "the newly developed theory allows us to study the pumped current for a variety of parameters , such as the pumping amplitude , pumping frequency , phase difference between two pumping potentials , the angular dependence between the magnetization of two leads , as well as the external bias .",
    "we have applied our theory to a tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) junction@xcite . due to the reported room temperature operation of tmr ,",
    "the fundmental principle and transport properties of tmr devices has attracted increasingly attention@xcite .",

    "is increased further to @xmath166 ( dotted line ) , the pumped current near @xmath64 reverses the direction and the new peak position shifts to @xmath167 . upon further increasing @xmath168 ,",
    "the curve of pumped current versus @xmath0 develops a flat region between @xmath169 with positive current while the magnitude of the negative pumped current at @xmath64 becomes larger ( see fig.9b ) . finally , at even larger frequency @xmath170",
    ", all the pumped currents are negative .",
    "this behavior can be understood from the photon assisted process@xcite .",
    "the quantum interference between contributions due to photon emission ( or absorption ) near two pumping potentials is essential to understand the nature of pumped current .",
    "in addition to the interference effect , the pumped current is also affected by a competition of between the photon emission and absorption processes which tend to cancel to each other .",
