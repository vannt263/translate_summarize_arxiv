    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the fundamental theory for strongly interacting matter predicts a deconfined state of quarks and gluons under conditions of sufficiently high temperatures and/or densities which occur , e.g. , in heavy - ion collisions , a few microseconds after the big bang or in the cores of pulsars .",
    "the unambiguous detection of the phase transition from hadronic to quark matter ( or vice - versa ) has been a challenge to particle and astrophysics over the past two decades @xcite . while the diagnostics of a phase transition in experiments with heavy - ion beams faces the problems of strong nonequilibrium and finite size , the dense matter in a compact star forms a macroscopic system in thermal and chemical equilibrium for which signals of a phase transition shall be more pronounced .",
    "such signals have been suggested in the form of characteristic changes of observables such as the surface temperature @xcite , brightness @xcite , pulse timing @xcite and rotational mode instabilities @xcite during the evolution of the compact object .",
    "in particular the pulse timing signal has attracted much interest since it is due to changes in the kinematics of rotation .",
    "thus it could be used not only to detect the occurrence but also to determine the size of the quark core from the magnitude of the braking index deviation from the magnetic dipole value @xcite . besides of the isolated pulsars",
    ", one can consider also the accreting compact stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) as objects from which we can expect signals of a deconfinement transition in their interior @xcite .",
    "the observation of quasiperiodic brightness oscillations ( qpos ) @xcite for some lmxbs has lead to very stringent constraints for masses and radii @xcite which according to @xcite could even favour strange quark matter interiors over hadronic ones for these objects . due to",
    "the mass accretion flow these systems are candidates for the formation of the most massive compact stars from which we expect to observe signals of the transition to either quark core stars , to a third family of stars @xcite or to black holes .",
    "each compact star configuratrion can be identified with a thermodynamical system characterized by the total baryon number ( or mass ) , temperature , spin frequency and magnetic field as thermodynamical variables .    since the evolutionary processes for the compact objects accompanying the structural changes are slow enough we will consider here the case of rigid rotation only and restrict ourselves to the degenerate systems at @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetic and thermal evolution of the neutron stars we will consider as decoupled from the mechanical evolution .    in this approximation we can introduce a classification of isolated and accreting compact stars in the plane of their angular frequency @xmath0 and mass ( baryon number @xmath1 ) which we will call _ phase diagram _ , see fig .",

    "each point in this phase diagram corresponds to a mechanical state of a neutron star .",
    "mechanical equilibrium of thermal pressure with gravitational and centrifugal forces leads to a stationary distribution of matter inside the configuration .",
    "this distribution is determined by the central density and rotational frequency .",
    "thermal and chemical equilibrium are described by an equation of state which determines the structure and composition of the compact star configuration .",
    "the requirements of stability restrict the region of stability of the quasistationary rotating star configurations . from the right hand side of the phase diagram",
    "there is a line which separates a region of stars which are collapsed to black holes ( bh ) from the stable ones . at high baryon numbers beyond this line gravitational forces dominate over pressure and centrifugal forces of matter .    from the top of the diagram the region of stable star configurations",
    "is separated by the keplerian frequencies @xmath4 from that where mass shedding under the centrifugal forces does not allow stationary rotating objects .    inside the region of stationary rotators",
    "one can distinguish two types of stationary rotating stars : those with quark matter cores ( qcss ) and hadronic stars ( hs ) @xcite . the region of the qcss is expected to be located at the bottom right of the phase diagram in the region of the most massive and slowly rotating compact stars . the critical line @xmath2 which separates the qcs region from that of hss is correlated with the local maxima of the moment of inertia with respect to changes of the baryon number at given angular velocity @xmath0 due to the change of the internal structure of the compact object at the deconfinement transition .    using the analogy with the phase diagram of a conventional thermodynamical system we can consider trajectories in this diagram as quasistationary evolutionary processes .",
    "since these processes for neutron stars have characteristic time scales ( @xmath5 yr ) much longer than those of typical observers it is almost impossible to trace these trajectories directly . a possible strategy for measuring evolutionary tracks will be to perform a statistics of the population of the different regions in the phase diagram .",
    "our aim is to investigate the conditions under which the passage of the phase border leads to observable significant clustering in the populations",
    ".    we will provide criteria under which a particular astrophysical scenario with spin evolution could be qualified to signal a deconfinement transition .",
    "since our focus is on the elucidation of qualitative features of signals from the deconfinement transition in the pulsar timing we will use a generic form of an equation of state ( eos ) with such a transition @xcite which is not excluded by the mass and radius constraints derived from qpos . in our case as well as in most of the approaches to quark deconfinement in neutron star matter a standard two - phase description of the equation of state is applied where the hadronic phase and the quark matter phase are modelled separately .",
    "the ambiguity in the choice of the bag constant for the description of the quark matter phase can be removed by a derivation of this quantity @xcite from a dynamical confining approach @xcite .",
    "the resulting eos is obtained by imposing gibbs conditions for phase equilibrium with the constraints of globally conserved baryon number and electric charge @xcite .    since nuclear forces",
    "are not fundamental , our knowledge about the equation of state for nuclear and neutron star matter at high densities is not very precise .",
    "there is not yet a description of the equation of state for strongly interacting matter on the fundamental level in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom where nucleons and mesons appear as composite structures .",
    "it is one of the goals of nuclear astrophysics and of neutron star physics to use pulsars and other compact objects as laboratories for studies of the nuclear forces and the phases of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the existence of several models for the equation of state for dense stellar matter allows a variability in the phase structure of neutron stars @xcite , therefore the phase diagram ( fig .",

    "for the detailed introduction of the phase diagram and a quantitative analysis using thermodynamical methods , we will employ a particular eos model @xcite which is characterized by a relatively hard hadronic matter part .",

    "[ fig : struct ] we show the critical regions of the phase transition in the inner structure of the star configuration as well as the equatorial and polar radii in the plane of angular velocity @xmath0 versus distance from the center of the star .",
    "it is obvious that with the increase of the angular velocity the star is deformating its shape .",

    "it is the aim of the present paper to investigate the conditions for a verification of the existence of the critical line @xmath2 by observation .",

    "the model independent result of our study is that a population clustering in the phase diagram for accreting compact stars shall measure the critical line @xmath2 which separates hadronic stars from qcss where the shape of this curve can discriminate between different models of the nuclear eos at high densities .",
    "on the example of the deconfinement transition from hadronic to quark matter we have demonstrated that the rotational frequency of accreting neutron stars is sensitive to changes of their inner structure .",
    "overclustering of the population of z - sources of lmxbs in the frequency - mass plane ( @xmath38 plane ) is suggested as a direct measurement of the critical line for the deconfinement phase transition since it is correlated to a maximum in the moment of inertia of the compact star .",
    "a generalization of the phase diagram method to other thermodynamical observables like thermal and electromagnetic processes is possible and will provide a systematical tool for the study of observable consequences of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "a population statistics in the space of the appropriate thermodynamic degrees of freedom allows a direct measurement of the shape of hypersurfaces representing the phase border which is characteristic for the equation of state of superdense stellar matter .",
    "in the present contribution we have considered the quasistationary evolution of accreting objects where the timescale for accreting about one solar mass and thus completing the deconfinement phase transition processes is set by the eddington rate to be about @xmath134 yr .",
    "therefore this analysis concerns rather old objects . for the cooling process , however , a characteristic timescale is the begin of the photon cooling era determined mainly by the relation of neutrino and photon emission rates .",
    "it occurs typically after @xmath135 yr , i.e. for much younger objects .",
    "phase transition effects , changing the emission rates , modify cooling curves for the neutron star surface temperature typically in this time interval , see voskresensky s contribution to this book @xcite .",
    "we have focussed here on the deconfinement phase transition only .",
    "the phase diagram method for developing strategies to investigate changes in the neutron star interiors is more general and can be applied to other phase transitions too , as e.g. the transition to superfluid nuclear matter @xcite , a kaon condensate @xcite or color superconducting quark matter @xcite with typical consequences for cooling and magnetic field evolution of the neutron star .    in order to consider the problem of magnetic field evolution in case of color superconductivity and diquark condensation",
    "one can use the phase diagram method to classify the magneto - hydrodynamical effects in the superfluid and superconducting phases , e.g. the creation of vortices in the quark core and their influence on the postglitch relaxation processes can be discussed @xcite .",
    "one can also modify the phase diagram approach to the case of self bound rotating quark stars ( strange stars ) @xcite .",
    "the application of our method could visualize the evolution of quark stars from normal to strange stars .      * acknowledgement * this work of h.g . and g.p",
