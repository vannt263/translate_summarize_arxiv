    "lorentz violation@xcite as a signal of new physics at the planck scale@xcite is actively sought in a wide variety of tests@xcite within the general test framework of the gravitational standard - model extension ( sme).@xcite a subset of these tests involve gravitational physics , which can probe lorentz violation in the pure - gravity sector associated with both minimal@xcite and nonminimal@xcite operators , as well as lorentz violation in matter - gravity couplings.@xcite while lorentz violation in gravity has been sought in a number of systems,@xcite we focus here on recent tests exploring gravitational erenkov radiation in sec .",
    "[ cos ] , and review the status of searches for the @xmath0 coefficient in the matter sector in sec .",
    "[ matter ] , including work with superconducting gravimeters.@xcite",
    "the erenkov radiation of photons by charged particles moving faster than the phase speed of light in ponderable media is a well - known phenomenon in nature .",
    "if the analogous situation of particles exceeding the phase speed of gravity were to occur , as might be the case in general relativity ( gr ) in the presence of certain media,@xcite the gravitational erenkov radiation of gravitons would be expected.@xcite in the presence of suitable coefficients for lorentz violation in the sme , both electrodynamic@xcite and gravitational@xcite erenkov radiation become possible in vacuum . in this section ,",
    "we review the tight constraints that have been achieved by considering cosmic rays and mention other possible implications of vacuum gravitational erenkov radiation.@xcite    as with all sme searches for lorentz violation , our analysis begins with the expansion about gr and the standard model provided by the sme action . here",
    "we consider the linearized pure - gravity sector , which has now been written explicitly for operators of arbitrary mass dimension @xmath1 that preserve the usual gauge invariance of gr.@xcite except where noted , we assume that the other sectors of the theory are conventional .",
    "exploration of the dispersion relation generated by this action reveals that a class of coefficients for lorentz violation manifest as a momentum - dependent metric perturbation that generates a momentum - dependent effective index of refraction for gravity . with an appropriate sign for the coefficients for lorentz violation ,",
    "this index is greater than 1 and particles may exceed the speed of gravity and radiate gravitons .",
    "hence each observation of a high - energy particle can place a one - sided constraint on a combination of these coefficients .    to obtain constraints",
    ", we perform a calculation of the rate of graviton emission that parallels standard methods assuming for simplicity and definiteness that only coefficients at one arbitrary dimension @xmath1 are nonzero .",
    "the calculation is provided for photons , massive scalars , and fermions , the only differences in the three cases being the details of the matrix element for the decay and the form of a dimensionless function of @xmath1 in the results .",
    "the rate of power loss can then be integrated to generate a relation between the time of flight @xmath2 for a candidate graviton - radiating particle , the energy of the particle at the beginning of its trip @xmath3 , and the observed energy at the end of its trip @xmath4 .",
    "this relation takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is newton s constant , @xmath7 is a species @xmath8 dependent function of @xmath1 , and @xmath9 is a combination of coefficients for lorentz violation at dimension @xmath1 that depends in general on the direction of travel for the particle .",
    "this result is distinguished from earlier work on the subject of gravitational erenkov radiation@xcite by the connection to the field - theoretic framework of the sme , the consideration of anisotropic effects , the exploration of arbitrary dimension @xmath1 , and the treatment of photons and fermions .",
    "conservative constraints can be placed using eq .   by setting @xmath10 , solving for @xmath9 , @xmath11 and using suitable data on cosmic ray observations.@xcite here",
    "@xmath12 is the travel distance .",
    "given the dependence on @xmath4 in eq .",
    ", the highest energy events yield the tightest bounds .",
    "the highest energy cosmic rays are believed to be nuclei , and continuing toward conservative constraints , we assume that the gravitons are radiated by a partonic fermion in an iron nucleus carrying 10% of observed energy @xmath13 , which leads to @xmath14 .",
    "a consideration of the likely origin of these particles leads to a conservative estimate of @xmath15  mpc .",
    "we then use the available data on cosmic ray energies and direction of origin@xcite to place constraints on six models .",
    "three of the models are constructed as the isotropic limit at @xmath16 respectively . in each of these models",
    "we place a one - sided limit on the one isotropic coefficient involved at the level of @xmath17 , @xmath18 gev@xmath19 , and @xmath20 gev@xmath21 respectively .",
    "the other three models involve two - sided constraints on the anisotropic coefficients at each @xmath1 . at @xmath22",
    "we place eight constraints at the @xmath23 level , while at @xmath24 we constrain 24 coefficients at the level of @xmath25 gev@xmath19 , and at @xmath26 we constrain 48 coefficients at the @xmath27 gev@xmath21 level .",
    "the paper concludes by discussing some ways in which our work might be extended .",
    "topics considered include the role of the matter sector , the impact of gravitational erenkov radiation by photons on cosmological models , and gravitons emitting electromagnetic erenkov radiation .",
    "in ref .   the phenomenology of matter - gravity couplings was developed with a focus on spin - independent coefficients , particularly the countershaded@xcite @xmath0 coefficients .",
    "as of the cpt13 meeting,@xcite constraints on @xmath0 had been placed using the following systems:@xcite precession of the perihelion of mercury@xcite and earth,@xcite torsion pendula,@xcite a torsion strip balance,@xcite atom interferometry,@xcite and co - magetometry.@xcite this work resulted in a number of measurements of the time component reaching the level of @xmath28 gev on both the neutron and the proton plus electron coefficients . for the spatial components ,",
    "two combinations of the nine coefficients were constrained at the level of @xmath29 gev , and four combinations were weakly constrained at the @xmath30 gev level .",
    "note that coverage is sufficient to span the space that is accessible without charged - matter experiments .",
    "since cpt13 , @xmath0 ( as well as @xmath31 ) has been considered in an analysis of planetary ephemerides.@xcite this work considerably extends the level of the independent constraints on @xmath32 coefficients to @xmath33 gev to @xmath34 gev , and the analysis of gravimeter experiments extends the maximum reach for these coefficients even further.@xcite the consideration of bound kinetic energy in equivalence - principle tests@xcite has also been used to further separate the @xmath35 coefficients and other matter - sector coefficients . though the @xmath0 coefficient space accessible with ordinary matter has now been covered more uniformly with initial constraints , opportunities for further improvements with currently available methods remain.@xcite                              r.  lehnert and r.  potting , phys .",
