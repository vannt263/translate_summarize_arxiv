    "our preliminary _ hetg _ spectra of ngc  5548 ( exposure time @xmath0 ks ) taken in 2000 , february , are shown in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2(a ) ( see also george , turner , yaqoob 2001 ) . the strongest features ( apart from fe  k@xmath1  see yaqoob _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 )  are the ovii he - like triplet and absorption features due to ne and o @xmath2 , and ovii  @xmath3 . see table 1 for a comparison with kaastra _",
    "_ ( 2000 ) .",
    "ovii ( f ) is particularly strong compared to ( i ) and ( r ) , indicating a photoionization - dominated plasma .",
    "it is consistent with being at the systemic velocity but we measure a range of blueshifts for the absorption lines .",
    "these , and detailed analysis will be reported in mckernan _",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "detailed _ chandra _ grating spectroscopy has now been published for five seyfert 1 galaxies , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "( 2001a ) present the highest s / n grating data available for any agn ( @xmath4 ks on ngc  3783 ; table 1 refers only to the shorter 53 ks observation ) .",
    "ngc  3227 was too weak for searching for narrow absorption / emission features ; 3c  273 is bright but no absorption / emission features were detected ( see george _",
    ". _ 2001 ) .",
    "ton  s  180 ( turner _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) and pg  1404 ( nandra _ et al .",
    "_ in preparation ) , both nls1 , show smooth soft x - ray continua with no narrow absorption / emission features . our own analysis of archival data for akn  564 , another nls1 , shows a prominent , broad absorption feature at @xmath5 kev , resolved by the meg .",
    "in addition to ngc  5548 , at least two other sources show multiple - velocity absorber systems ( ngc  4051 , collinge _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; ngc  3783 , kaspi _ et al .",
    "_ 2001b , george _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . in all cases",
    "when absorption lines are detected they appear to be in outflow , except in mcg  @xmath66@xmath630@xmath615 ( in which the lines are consistent with the galaxy systemic velocity ) . in all cases where",
    "emission lines are detected they appear to be consistent with the galaxy systemic velocity , except for ngc  4151 , in which the emission is consistent with the small outflow velocity of the optical nlr .",
    "see table 1 for details .",
    "2(b ) compares the _ chandra _ meg soft x - ray spectra , ( binned at approximately _ asca _ resolution ) , of four agn ( ngc  3783 , mkn  509 , ngc  5548 , ngc  4051 ) , with historical _ asca _ data .",
    "given that these sources are time - variable , the agn show similar features with _",
    "chandra _ and _ asca_. deep absorption edges are seen in ngc  3783 and mkn  509 .",
    "these could be due to ovii and oviii , but the lower energy edge could also be due to fei ( locked up in dust ? ) as suggested by lee _",
    "( 2001 ) for mcg  @xmath66@xmath630@xmath615 .",
    "however , ngc  5548 and ngc  4051 have prominent soft excesses .",
    "if soft excess is from a larger region than the warm absorber , it could mask underlying absorption features .",
    "however , the depth of the edges depends on the physical conditions of the asborber , so the apparent absence of an edge should not be alarming .",
    "as has been suspected for a long time the fe - k lines in agn are generally complex , being composed of a narrow component ( originating far from the putative central black hole ) and a broad component , originating from closer to the black hole ( e.g. see weaver _ et al . _ 1997 ; yaqoob _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; reeves _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) . in a given observation of a given agn only one of these may dominate , or they may both be comparable .",
    "therefore it is important to account for when modeling the broad , relativistic disk lines .",
    "some preliminary results for _ hetg _ measurements of the narrow line are given in table 2 .",
    "four of these _ hetg _ narrow fe - k lines are shown in fig .",
    "3 , along with the overall , total fe - k lines measured with non - contemporaneous _ asca _ observations .",
    "_ these are single - gaussian fits and may be misleading if the overall line profile is complex .",
    "_ in fact the large ew for ngc  4151 may be due to inadequate modeling of the broad - line component and/or the continuum being particularly weak in this observation .",
    "errors are 90% for one interesting parameter .",
    "we are extending this census of the fe - k region using _",
    "chandra _ _ hetg _ ( simultaneous with other missions whenever possible ) to many other sources .",
    "full results for ngc  3516 , mkn  509 , ngc  4593 , f  9 , 3c  120 , ngc  7314 , and more , will be reported in the near future .",
