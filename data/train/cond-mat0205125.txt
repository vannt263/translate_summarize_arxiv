    "a dna molecule may undergo transitions from a double stranded to a single stranded state , either under the effect of an increase in temperature @xmath0 ( thermal denaturation ) , or through applied forces at one end of the chain ( mechanical unzipping ) @xcite . in the characterization of such transitions , and in the determination of their universal , asymptotic features , substantial progresses were made recently by applications of models and methods of polymer statistics @xcite . among these progresses is an extension @xcite of the classical poland and sheraga ( ps ) model @xcite . in the ps model",
    "the partition function of a dna chain is approximated by that of a sequence of non - interacting double - stranded segments and denaturated loops , and the thermal denaturation transition results of second order type @xcite .",
    "recently , excluded volume effects between a loop and the rest of the chain were included in the ps description in an approximate way @xcite , using results from the theory of polymer networks @xcite .",
    "this approach predicts a first order denaturation , in agreement with very recent numerical studies of models taking fully into account the self and mutual avoidance among loops and double segments @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , the approximate scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite yields results which are in good quantitative agreement with monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "most recently , predictions based on the theory of polymer networks were also made for the case of mechanical unzipping @xcite .    besides confirming the expected first order character of thermal denaturation , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that excluded volume effects alone are responsible for this character , while the difference in stiffness between double and single stranded dna , and sequence heterogeneity do not affect the asymptotic nature of the transition .",
    "all these results rise interesting and debated  @xcite issues and open new perspectives in the field .",
    "first of all , one would like to test numerically the existing analytical estimates , in particular the new ones pertaining to the case of mechanical unzipping .",
    "the validity of crucial predictions relies on such tests , which should also reveal whether the quantitative success in the case of thermal unzipping is rather fortuitous , or there is some deep and systematic basis for it .",
    "the network picture proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , besides allowing some elegant and successful estimates , could constitute an important step forward in our way of representing the physics of dna at denaturation .",
    "progress in the assessment of the validity and limitations of a network picture for denaturating dna should be allowed by a more careful and systematic analysis of numerical results for specific models .",
    "the possible extension and improvement of previous analyses for the relevant three dimensional case is also a main motivation of the present work .    in this article",
    "we consider a lattice model of dna both in two and in three dimensions ( @xmath1 ) with excluded volume effects fully implemented . by various numerical methods we estimate length distributions for denaturated loops and unzipped end - segments .",
    "in particular , for the transition in three dimensions we give here exponent estimates which extend and improve the results of a previous study @xcite .",
    "moreover , our results allow to address the basic issues mentioned above , and to clearly identify some qualitative and quantitative limitations of the picture proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the analysis gives also hints which allow us to propose a generalization of the polymer network representation of denaturating dna .",
    "our model in two dimensions , besides deserving some interest in connection with problems like the unzipping of double stranded polymers adsorbed on a substrate , offers an ideal context in which to compare the predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite with numerical results .",
    "indeed , for @xmath2 those predictions are based on exactly known network exponents , while in @xmath3 the same exponents have been approximately determined .",
    "the model studied here was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and further analyzed and extended in ref .",
    "we consider two self - avoiding walks ( saws ) of length @xmath4 on square and cubic lattices , described by the vectors identifying the positions of each monomer @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the walks , which represent the two dna strands , have a common origin @xmath8 and only monomers with the same coordinate along the saw s can overlap each other ( i.e. @xmath9 only if @xmath10 ) .",
    "an overlap corresponds to a bound state of complementary dna base pairs , to which we assign an energy @xmath11 , thus neglecting the effects of sequence heterogeneities .",
    "this is an acceptable approximation in view of the fact that , at coarse grained level , each monomer ( site visited by the saw ) should represent a whole persistence length of the single strand , which includes several ( @xmath12 ) bases .",
    "a denaturated loop of length @xmath13 occurs whenever , for some @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 .    at a temperature",
    "@xmath0 each configuration @xmath19 of the two strands appears in the statistics with probability proportional to its boltzmann s weight @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ( boltzmann s constant @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 is @xmath24 times the number of bound base pairs in @xmath19 . the resulting behavior of the dna model resembles the scaling of a @xmath25-step saw as long as the inverse temperature @xmath26 is lower than a critical value @xmath27 . for @xmath28",
    "the strands are typically paired in a sequence of bound segments alternating with denatured loops , the latter gradually shrinking and becoming rarer for increasing @xmath26 . for @xmath28 and @xmath29 the scaling of an @xmath4-step saw holds . around @xmath27",
    "there is a crossover from one regime to the other , and exactly at @xmath27 peculiar scaling behaviors are expected for the distributions of loops and end - segments .",
    "we focus first on the two - dimensional case . fig .",

    "the data are obtained from exact enumerations for walks up to @xmath32 . for each chain length",
    ", the pdf is sampled at the temperature corresponding to the specific heat maximum .",
    "this choice offers the advantage that , if the specific heat diverges at the transition , like in our case , the correct transition temperature is asymptotically singled out for @xmath33 .",
    "thus , in this limit , the sequence of distributions should automatically approach the critical pdf , for which we expect power - law scaling .",

    "the lower inset shows a scaling collapse of the data , obtained with @xmath40 .",
    "the good quality of the collapse indicates that the system is very close to the asymptotic regime although the chains are quite short .",
    "we also performed a monte carlo determination of @xmath36 using the pruned enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite , through which walks are generated by a growth procedure . in this case the critical temperature at which the pdf was sampled was determined by carefully monitoring the scaling with @xmath4 of the average end - to - end distance @xmath41 as a function of temperature .",
    "the effective exponents describing the growth with @xmath4 of this quantity are plotted as a function of @xmath26 for different chain lengths in fig .",
    "[ fig:02 ] @xcite .",
    "the intersections of the various curves in a very narrow range signals the crossover expected at denaturation for this quantity and allows to locate the melting temperature rather accurately , i.e. @xmath42 . by fitting the initial slope of the critical pdf for chains up to @xmath43 we extrapolate @xmath44 , in good agreement with the exact enumeration results .    0.2truecm    the value of @xmath36 for loops with @xmath45 was predicted analytically @xcite using exact results for entropic exponents of networks of arbitrary topology @xcite . for a network of fixed topology @xmath46",

    "the value of @xmath52 depends on the number of independent loops , @xmath53 , and on the number of vertices with @xmath54 legs , @xmath55 , as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the radius of gyration exponent and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , are exactly known exponents in @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath60    this general scaling framework was applied to the dna unzipping by considering relevant network topologies for the problem @xcite . for example , in order to study the denaturated loop length pdf , one can assimilate the situation of a typical loop within dna to that of the loop in fig .",
    "[ fig:03](b ) .",
    "this amounts to assume that the action of the rest of the dna molecule is the same as that of two long linear tails , thus totally disregarding the presence of other loops . according to eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , for @xmath46 corresponding to the topology in fig .",
    "[ fig:03](b ) , one has @xcite @xmath61 in this equation we explicitly assume that , while the connectivity of a loop step is equal to @xmath62 , that of a step of the tails is @xmath63 .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the thermodynamics of the denaturation transition and follows from the continuity of the canonical free energy of the system , and from the fact that each step of the tails corresponds in fact to two steps of the loops . in this way the @xmath13 dependence of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ loop ] ) does not enter in the exponential growth factor , an important requisite for the derivations below  @xcite . for @xmath64",
    "the number of configurations should reduce to that of a single double stranded chain of length @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath65 with @xmath66 , according to eq .",

    "so , the @xmath13 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ loop ] ) becomes @xmath69 , with @xcite @xmath70 clearly , in this approximation , @xmath36 is also the exponent by which the loop length pdf , @xmath71 , scales . in reality , the segments departing from the two sides of the loop replace more complex fluctuating structures containing denaturated bubbles of all sizes , separated by short linear double stranded segments . in @xmath2 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , therefore @xmath74 , which is a value consistent within error bars with our numerical estimates .",
    "as already known in @xmath3 @xcite , this agreement implies that the sequences of loops which  dress \" the two segments departing from the loop in fig .",

    "the pdf results @xmath87",
    ".    0.2truecm    figure [ fig:04 ] shows a plot of the logarithm of the pdf for end segments of length @xmath75 , @xmath88 , as a function of ( a ) @xmath89 and ( b ) @xmath90 .",
    "the data obtained from the perm show coexistence of two distinct power - law scaling behaviors , i.e.  @xmath91 and @xmath92 where a linear fit yields @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the slope determinations are rather sharp in this case , and , in fact , the criterion of selecting the denaturation temperature in correspondence with the simultaneous manifestation of the power law behaviors of @xmath95 is very efficient , and consistent with that based on monitoring the behavior of @xmath96 .",
    "the existence of two distinct slopes , and the values of the exponents are in disagreement with what one expects on the basis of the network approximation , i.e. @xmath97 in @xmath2 .",
    "thus , for some reason , on @xmath98 the effects of the structure of the double stranded part of the chain are noticeable and the schematization through a simple polymer network topology is not fully adequate to represent the physics . in the case @xmath99 the number of single chain configurations is indeed that of a simple linear saw of length @xmath25 , which is asymptotically exactly known in two dimensions @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath82 ,",
    "the configurations to count are those of an effective linear saw chain of length @xmath4 , whose internal structure contains loops at all scales .",
    "it is conceivable that not only the connective constants , but also the entropic scaling properties of such effective walk differ from those of a standard saw .",
    "the difference must concern the power law correction to the exponential growth factor of the number of configurations as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , as already remarked above , the connectivity constant of the effective , double stranded walk at the transition , must be just the square of the simple saw connectivity constant .",
    "this follows from an obvious requirement of free energy continuity and from the fact that in the high temperature region the two strands behave as unbound simple saw , with a total length twice that of the effective double stranded walk , independent of temperature @xcite .    to investigate this issue",
    "further we determined directly , on the basis of perm data , also the overall entropic behavior of the dna chain .",
    "we considered two types of boundary conditions : ( 1 ) the extremes ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) of the chain are free and ( 2 ) are forced to join in a single point ( @xmath102 ) , while in both cases , the strands have still a common origin ( @xmath103 ) .    condition ( 1 ) is the one applying to the effective walk discussed above .",
    "we indicate with @xmath104 and @xmath105 the corresponding partition functions . in the spirit of the network approximation",
    ", we neglect the contribution of denaturated loops within the double stranded phase one has @xmath106 , with @xmath107 .",
    "we estimate also @xmath104 within the same general framework , by integrating the partition function @xmath85 of eq .",
    "( [ fork ] ) over all possible end - segment lengths .",
    "this integration gives    @xmath108    as the integration of the scaling function @xmath109 yields an extra factor proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "defining @xmath110 one eventually gets : @xmath111 this is a theoretical expression for the entropic exponent of a dna molecule as a whole , and can be directly compared with numerical estimates , one of which already exists in @xmath3 @xcite , as we discuss in the next sections .    to calculate the entropic exponents @xmath112 and @xmath113 we estimated the quantity @xmath114 by perm sampling for reasonably long chains . for @xmath33 one expects @xmath115    since @xmath62 must coincide with the saw connective constant , which in @xmath2 is very precisely known ( @xmath116 @xcite ) , large @xmath4 data for the quantity on the l.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ z2nzn ] ) can be fitted by keeping as unique fitting parameter @xmath117 in the r.h.s .",
    "alternatively , one can assume a value for @xmath117 and check whether data appear consistent with the assumed correction term in the same r.h.s .",
    "this consistency test is best applied to sets of data pertaining to different temperatures close to the transition , as illustrated in the next section .",
    "since the correction term is rather sensitive to the choice of the temperature , this offers also a way of locating the transition .",
    "here we just mention that the slopes predicted on the basis of the network approximation in @xmath2 appear slightly , but definitely , inconsistent with the data , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the polymer network representation of denaturating dna @xcite was originally proposed as a useful , but definitely approximate tool , without the possibility of controllable and systematic improvements .",
    "for example , the environment seen by a single fluctuating loop within the molecule was not proposed as something unique , and choices slightly different from that discussed above were also discussed @xcite . with these alternative choices , leading to slightly different results , the portions of the molecule surrounding the loop were not necessarily treated as made of simple double segments .",
    "even if the approximate character remains , all the discrepancies and inconsistencies discussed in the previous section can be resolved by a refinement of the whole picture and an improvement of the approach , which could allow more accurate predictions in the future . in the new perspective",
    "we propose , the rules for associating a network schematization to loops or end - segments should be regarded as unique .",
    "this follows from the fact that the new polymeric entities one defines are supposed to account , at an effective level , for all the complications arising from the fluctuating geometry of the model .",
    "the legs of the network are either simple self - avoiding chains , in case they are really made of single strands , or effective , dressed segments , when they represent fluctuating double stranded portions of the molecule comprised between two given bound base pairs .",
    "this clear cut distinction suggests that the exponents @xmath58 , associated with the network vertices , should be modified with respect to the `` bare '' values considered so far , as soon as at least one outgoing leg is of the double stranded , dressed type . indeed , within the framework of a continuum edwards model description of the inhomogeneous polymer network , and of renormalization group ideas , one can postulate the validity of homogeneity laws and exponent relations analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) , with modified @xmath118 s where appropriate .",
    "something like this was already done in ref .",
    "@xcite where explicit field theoretical calculations were performed in the case of copolymer star networks ( no loops ) .",
    "these stars were composed of mutually excluding branches made either of random walks , or of self avoiding walks . in the case",
    "considered here the copolymer is made of two kinds of segments which do not differ as far as metric scaling exponents are concerned ( same @xmath57 ) , but can have different entropic scaling properties .",
    "it is indeed quite conceivable that an effective linear structure , which should be resolved into a sequence of denaturated segments and loops of all sizes , could have an entropic scaling different from the one of a simple saw on the lattice , even if the elongation grows in the same way with @xmath4 .",
    "0.2truecm    the above considerations lead us to introduce two new exponents : @xmath119 for an isolated vertex with a dressed segment , and @xmath120 for a vertex joining a dressed segment and two self avoiding walks , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] . as discussed above",
    ", the introduction of such @xmath121 s amounts to postulating a generalization of the scaling in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) to copolymer networks with two different types of segments . following the same arguments leading to eqs.([exponentc ] ) ,",
    "( [ cbar ] ) and ( [ gammastar ] ) and using now the modified exponents wherever appropriate , one finds : @xmath122 which is a set of five equations with only two unknown parameters , @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "these equations should be regarded as consistency requirements in order to test the validity of the proposed copolymer picture .",
    "notice that within the copolymer network scheme the exponents associated to the distributions of short and long end - segments are distinct , @xmath125 , as soon as @xmath126 . by solving the first two equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) with the numerical values for @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we find @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "while the former is actually compatible with zero , the latter is not .",
    "once the values of @xmath123 and @xmath131 have been fixed , we can check for the consistency of the other exponents using eqs .",

    "a main reason why the copolymer network description turns out to be well compatible with the observed scalings is probably the fact that the pdf of loop length scales always with a sufficiently large @xmath36 exponent .",

    ". this discrepancy could be due to the more complicated topology of the loops and could indicate that the model is less favorable for the application of a network picture .",

    "block copolymer networks are a still relatively unexplored subject , in spite of the obvious fundamental and applicative interest .",
    "thus , the realization that such networks could also be very relevant for a description of system like dna at denaturation , at the moment , can not yield quantitative predictions based on field theory results .",
    "indeed , even the problem of identifying which kind of copolymer model in the continuum , if any , could represent correctly our discrete dna in the scaling limit is far from trivial and completely open .",
    "for sure the identification of dna as a system potentially connected to the copolymer network physics adds further interest to these intriguing objects , which are already known to be somehow related to multifractal aspects of polymer statistics @xcite and , in the @xmath2 case , could realize interesting examples of conformal invariance .    we thank d. mukamel for fruitful discussions and e. orlandini for ongoing collaboration .",
