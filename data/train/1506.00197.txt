    "[ sec : intro ] in this paper we are interested in finite volume numerical simulations of pdes of hyperbolic type with transport term . more precisely we are looking to correct the numerical diffusion which appears in the simulations of the asymptotic profile of such pdes . indeed",
    "this numerical diffusion is an artifact that is inherent to most of existing numerical schemes even for high - order ones .",
    "so , as reported first in @xcite and confirmed in @xcite for the lifshitz - slyozov equation which is of transport type , capturing numerically the exact asymptotic profile for transport equation is a real challenge because numerical diffusion smooths out the fronts and leads to an artificial profile . in the context of biology modelling , specially in population dynamics ,",
    "most of existing models @xcite contain at least a transport part which takes into account the growth of the considered population , it is crucial to recover the exact asymptotic profile in order to predict the behavior of the population or to estimate some parameters for instance its growth , division or death rates by using measures that are based on the profile .",
    "some authors address the question consisting to correct this inherent numerical diffusion by establishing adequate schemes such as the weno ( weighted essentially non - oscillatory ) scheme @xcite , anti - dissipative scheme the adm ( anti dissipative method ) @xcite , etc .",
    "all these schemes define their numerical fluxes in order to minimize at best the artifacts .",
    "we propose here a hybrid finite volume scheme where the construction of the numerical flux appears as a combination of the weno and adm fluxes .",
    "this scheme is very suitable for firstly removing de numerical artifacts but also correct the stair treads appearing in adm scheme .",
    "more precisely we use a discontinuity detector at each grid point and use the weno order 5 scheme when the solution is regular near the point otherwise we apply the adm . as a validation of this hybrid scheme we use two kind of test cases .",
    "the first one is a classical ( academic ) test case for transport equation where the initial distribution is considered in one hand as a very oscillatory one as given in @xcite ; in the other hand , we use in 2d the famous zalesak disk test that is given in @xcite .",
    "the second kind of test is based on population dynamics and polymerization process where we consider a population of cells or polymers growing either by nutrients uptake ( for cells ) or by gain and lost of monomers ( for polymers ) .",
    "this application on population dynamics is of great importance because in many cases some predictions on the numerical behavior of the solution allow to investigate inverse problem of estimating relevant parameters of the considered model .",
    "so , having a bad numerical reconstruction induces bad parameters estimation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : adm0 ] , we recall the biology context on which we focus our study . in the third section ,",
    "we detail the derivation of our hybrid scheme which is based on a general conservation laws .",
    "the section [ sec : detector ] is devoted to the numerical results and comparison of our hybrid method against the weno and adm schemes .",
    "in cell biology as in physics of particles , the evolution dynamics of a group of cells or macro - particles in cell culture or in a bath of micro - particles plays a central role in the understanding and the explanation of some physical and biological behaviors",
    ". often the observed quantities evolve by growth process either by nutrients uptake ( the example of the micro - organism _ daphnia _ which uses the nutrients to grow ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.3.1 ) , @xcite ) or by earnings micro - particles by polymerization ( for polymers modeling @xcite ) .    lot of conjectures are based on the observation of these quantities , especially on their evolution dynamics in long term . in modeling point of view",
    "this long term evolution dynamic is obtained by the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the considered quantity .    following the processes taken into account in the model ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior can either be dependent or be independent of the initial distribution of the considered group of cells or parasites .",
    "indeed , in the case where the considered population evolves only by growth it is proven in lifshitz - slyozov equations that the asymptotic behavior depends on the initial distribution @xcite . however",
    ", when aggregation process or division process is taken into account , the asymptotic behavior is regularized towards a quasi - universal profile as shown in @xcite and then it is independent to the initial distribution .",
    "+ a crucial point linked to the modelling of these phenomena is the numerical simulation which can lead , following the used scheme , to bad conjectures on the behavior of the model .",
    "these bad conjectures result to some numerical artifacts caused by numerical diffusion inherent to some standard schemes @xcite .    in order to apply the hybrid method proposed later in this paper , we consider the following test case where a size - structured cells population model is taken into account and the cells evolve by gain or loss of micro cells .",
    "let denote by @xmath0 the size density repartition of cells of size @xmath1 , located at position @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) at time @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a smooth bounded domain .",
    "then the model can be written for all @xmath6 as follows    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the concentration of micro - organisms ( nutrients ) and it follows a diffusion equation of this form : @xmath9 for this kind of coupling model - , the kinetic coefficients @xmath10 , @xmath11 are interpreted as the rates at which cells gain or loss nutriments ( monomers , micro - organisms ) .",
    "we assume the micro - cells ( or monomers ) to follow a diffusion equation as depicted in equation .",
    "we endowed this diffusion equation with a homogeneous neumann boundary condition where @xmath12 is the outward unit vector at point @xmath13 .",
    "+ the problem - is a variant of the very known standard lifshitz - slyozov system which models the evolution of a population of macro - particles immersed in a bath of monomers @xcite .",
    "the analytical study of - concerning the existence , uniqueness and properties of the solution is rigorously done in @xcite and the main result is based on the following hypothesis : + * hypothesis . *",
    "the kinetic coefficients @xmath14 are required to satisfy @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is an increasing function with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; @xmath19 and for any @xmath20 there exists @xmath21 such that @xmath22 for @xmath23 . + the initial condition satisfy @xmath24 ; @xmath25 .",
    "+ with this previous hypothesis , the authors in @xcite prove the following statement on the well - posedness of - :    there exists a weak solution @xmath26 of - with , for any @xmath27 , + @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ; l^2 ( \\omega)-weak)$ ] , @xmath31 ; l^{1}(\\omega\\times(0,\\infty))-weak)$ ] .",
    "in addition they prove thanks to the neumann boundary condition , the following mass preservation relation : @xmath32=0.\\ ] ]    the fact that the space variable @xmath33 acts as a parameter in the size density repartition @xmath34 implies that is a transport equation and the study of its asymptotic behavior is numerically very challenging .    indeed , following the chosen model as in ",
    ", one needs in the modelling and simulations to recover the evolution dynamics of the considered population such as the time evolution of the total number of individuals ( even in asymptotic time ) , the total mass of the population or the conservation law fulfilled by the model . for the numerical simulations of the evolution dynamics ,",
    "a very adapted scheme is required in order to capture in exact way the solution of the system without artifact in order to get the right and essential properties . that s the aim to introduce the following hybrid method .",
    "in this section , we consider the following advection equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a given smooth velocity field .",

    "the objective of remain part is to find an alternative method such that it keeps the shock near discontinuities while has high accuracy in smooth regions . to the end , we propose the following hybrid method .      we denote @xmath101 the flux computed by the anti - dissipative method and @xmath102 the flux computed by a high accurate method , for instance the fifth order method  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the parameter @xmath113 depended on the index @xmath65 and it was a convex combination of the global and local scales , _",

    "the anti - diffusive method has perfect performance for the step function , however it destroys the very smooth function .",
    "indeed , it turns the smooth function into a sawtooth profile , which can not be regularized by refining mesh .",

    "in this paper we have proposed a hybrid finite volumes scheme based on the flux convex combination between the anti - dissipative method ( adm ) @xcite and the weno order 5 method @xcite .",
    "the obtained numerical results show a good accuracy in reconstructing the solution of transport type equation even in case of discontinuous initial data .",

    "the hybrid scheme show better numerical results than de adm scheme in the sense that it advects very well the solution without `` stairs '' and it shows also better results than weno scheme which develop numerical diffusion for irregular distribution as depicted in figure [ fig : growth_homo ] .",
    "so , when the weno order 5 scheme fails because of numerical diffusion artifact , the hybrid method remains anti - dissipative and when adm scheme develops  stairs \" like oscillations , the hybrid scheme corrects them .",
    "this property is very suitable for long term asymptotic behavior of the solution of population dynamics , as presented in the numerical simulations for the polymerization / depolymerization type models .",
