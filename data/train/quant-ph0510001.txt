    "evolution of a quantum system subject to external time - dependent fields is a well studied problem that goes all the way to the origins of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , driven dynamics in conventional atomic physics rarely involves as intricate dynamical interference patterns as those that occur , e.g. , in multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments and other applications of coherent control ( cc ) where precisely shaped and timed signals are used to steer the quantum evolution of the system .",
    "one such control method@xcite originally developed in nmr is a pulse - based technique known as dynamical recoupling ( also , `` bang - bang '' , in the case of hard , @xmath3-function - like pulses ) . in the simplest setup ,",
    "the system is a collection of individually - controlled weakly - coupled parts ( e.g. , qubits ) .",
    "individual qubits undergo a rapid forced precession , while the overall long - time evolution of the system is governed by the effective hamiltonian averaged over their precession . for example",
    ", the interaction @xmath4 between the two qubits is cancelled on average if one of them is rapidly precessing around the @xmath5-axis .",
    "such cancellation of the quantum evolution is called `` dynamical decoupling '' or `` refocusing '' ; it is obviously related to the spin - echo experiment@xcite .",
    "an exciting thing about dynamical decoupling is its universality : one does not need to know the magnitude of the interaction precisely to cancel it .",
    "moreover , with sufficiently fast pulse rate one can also cancel the evolution due to slowly - varying external perturbations , in effect suppressing the decoherence caused by the environment@xcite .",
    "general analysis of such methods was limited to numerics and/or the idealized @xmath3-function - like `` hard '' pulses whose duration was either ignored or assumed small . in real experiments ( especially in solid - state systems ) , very short pulses are impractical because they tend to couple to degrees of freedom in wide spectral range which leads to signal distortions and heating@xcite . besides , from the previous studies it is hard to judge whether high - order refocusing sequences involving more intricate cancellation ( dynamical destructive interference ) of the quantum dynamics have a real advantage in suppressing the decoherence .",
    "the goal of this work is to construct a general theory of quantum kinetics of open systems in the presence of periodic refocusing fields designed to suppress the internal evolution and decouple the system from outside degrees of freedom .",
    "we describe the evolution of the density matrix of such systems , with weak internal and thermal bath couplings , in the approximation of master ( quantum kinetic ) equation in the floquet formalism .",
    "the kinetics of the system is treated in a non - markovian approximation@xcite , which is essential to trace the decoherence suppression with the bath `` slow '' on the scale of the driven dynamics .",
    "our analysis begins with the assumption that the period-@xmath1 control fields provide order-@xmath0 refocusing for the system with the bath frozen .",
    "that is , if we replace the operators for the external degrees of freedom by @xmath6-numbers , the cumulant expansion of the evolution operator in powers of thus modified internal hamiltonian begins with the terms of order @xmath7 .",
    "the control fields are assumed to be stong and we treat them exactly .",
    "we trace the cancellations associated with refocusing in the kernel of the quantum kinetic equation ( qke ) which describes the dissipative dynamics of the density matrix of the system with bath present , and characterize the remaining decoherence processes .",
    "we illustrate the general analytic results derived for orders @xmath8 , which is the accuracy of the employed qke , with the numerical simulations of dynamics of a single spin in the presence of a classical fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "generally , for a weakly - coupled system weakly interacting with slow degrees of freedom ( thermal bath ) with the correlation time @xmath9 , the decoherence is due to dissipative processes ( resonant decay ) which create excitation(s ) in the environment , as well as reactive processes which result in dephasing , or scrambling of the phase of the system .",
    "the associated decoherence rate is proportional to the square of the coupling matrix element and the correlation time @xmath9 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : decoherence - rate - stationary ] ) . as a result of forced precession of the system caused by the control fields , the effective environment seen by the system is modulated out of resonance , which may entirely suppress the state decay@xcite . only first - order ( @xmath10 ) refocusing is necessary to achieve such an effect .",
    "we show that , in addition , the rate of reactive processes is reduced by a factor of @xmath11 [ eq .  ( [ eq : decoherence - rate - one ] ) ] , where the period of the refocusing sequence , @xmath1 , is assumed to be smaller than @xmath9 . with second - order refocusing ,",
    "@xmath12 , the decoherence rate is additionally suppressed [ eq .  ( [ eq : decoherence - rate - two ] ) ] , and with time - reversal invariant bath coupling may even become exponentially small in this parameter ( in which case it will be determined by terms of higher order in bath coupling , beyound the accuracy of our qke ) .",
    "in addition to the decoherence rates which characterize the exponential decay of quantum correlations with time , we also analyze the corresponding prefactor , which determines the initial decoherence@xcite . while for generic refocusing sequences with",
    "@xmath13 initial decoherence is quadratic in @xmath1 and does not scale with the thermal bath correlation time @xmath9 , we show that for symmetric pulse sequences it is reduced by an additional power of @xmath14 .",
    "our results extend the well - established theory@xcite of the kinetics of few - level systems in r.f .",
    "field to cases involving a more intricate cancellation ( dynamical destructive interference ) of the quantum dynamics characteristic of higher - order refocusing sequences .",
    "they put in a perspective the previous analyses of decoherence in the presence of hard - pulse sequences@xcite , establish a firm basis for future studies of decoherence scaling in large driven qubit systems ( with and without long - range coupling due to long - wavelength phonons which may be correlated@xcite between distant qubits , contrary to a common assumption in the quantum error - correction theory@xcite ) , and present an efficient alternative to optimum control techniques based directly on the master equation@xcite .",
