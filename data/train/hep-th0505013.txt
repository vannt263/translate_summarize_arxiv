    "it is still a challenging problem to know the exact physical situation at very early stages of the formation of our universe . at the very early stages of evolution of universe",
    ", it is generally assumed that during the phase transition ( as the universe passes through its critical temperature ) the symmetry of the universe is broken spontaneously .",
    "it can give rise to topologically stable defects such as domain walls , strings and monopoles.@xcite@xmath0@xcite    of all these cosmological structures , cosmic strings have excited the most interest .",
    "the present day configurations of the universe are not contradicted by the large scale network of strings in the early universe . moreover",
    ", they may act as gravitational lenses and may give rise to density fluctuations leading to the formations of galaxies .",
    "@xcite strings posses stress energy and are coupled to the gravitational field .    in string theory , the myriad of particle types is replaced by a single fundamental building block , a string. these strings can be closed , like loops , or open , like a hair . as the string moves through time it traces out a tube or a sheet , according to",
    "whether it is closed or open , furthermore , the string is free to vibrate , and different vibrational modes of the string represent the different particle types , since different modes are seen as different masses or spins",
    ".    one mode of vibration , or note , makes the string appear as an electron , another as a photon .",
    "there is even a mode describing the graviton , the particle carrying the force of gravity , which is an important reason why string theory has received so much attention .",
    "the point is that we can make sense of the interaction of two gravitons in string theory in a way we could not in qft .",
    "there are no infinities ! and gravity is not something we put in by hand .",
    "it has to be there in a theory of strings .",
    "so , the first great achievement of string theory was to give a consistent theory of quantum gravity , which resembles gr at macroscopic distances",
    ". moreover string theory also possesses the necessary degrees of freedom to describe the other interactions ! at this point",
    "a great hope was created that string theory would be able to unify all the known forces and particles together into a single theory of everything.    in this study , we will attach strange quark matter to the string cloud .",
    "it is plausible to attach strange quark matter to the string cloud . because , one of such transitions during the phase transitions of the universe could be quark gluon plasma @xmath1 ( called quark - hadron phase transition ) when cosmic temperature was @xmath2 mev .",
    "recently , masaharu and fukutome@xcite and narodetski _ _ et al.__@xcite have studied tetra quark particle and pentaquarks in the string model , respectively .",
    "also , harko and cheng have studied strange quark matter adopting in the form of perfect fluid in the spherical symmetric space - times.@xcite    the possibility of the existence of quark matter dates back to early seventies .",
    "bodmer@xcite and witten@xcite have proposed two ways of formation of strange matter : the quark - hadron phase transition in the early universe and conversion of neutron stars into strange ones at ultrahigh densities . in the theories of strong interaction",
    "quark bag models suppose that breaking of physical vacuum takes place inside hadrons . as a result vacuum energy densities inside and outside",
    "a hadron become essentially different , and the vacuum pressure on the bag wall equilibrates the pressure of quarks , thus stabilizing the system . if the hypothesis of the quark matter is true , then some of neutrons stars could actually be strange stars , built entirely of strange matter.@xcite@xmath0@xcite    typically , strange quark matter is modeled with an equation of state ( eos ) based on the phenomenological bag model of quark matter , in which quark confinement is described by an energy term proportional to the volume .    in this model , quarks are though as degenerate fermi gases , which exist only in a region of space endowed with a vacuum energy density @xmath3 ( called as the bag constant ) .",
    "also , in the framework of this model the quark matter is composed of massless u , d quarks , massive s quarks and electrons .    in the simplified version of the bag model ,",
    "assuming quarks are massless and non interacting , we then have quark pressure @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the quark energy density ) ; the total energy density is @xmath6 but total pressure is @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we will solve einstein s field equations for spherical symmetric space - times with strange quark matter attached to the string cloud via conformal killing vector ( ckv ) .",
    "general relativity provides a rich arena to use symmetries in order to understand the natural relation between geometry and matter furnished by the einstein equations .",
    "symmetries of geometrical / physical relevant quantities of this theory are known as collineations .",
    "the most useful collineations is conformal killing vectors .",
    "so , in this paper it is imposed the condition that the space - time manifold admits a conformal killing vector .",
    "conformal killing vectors provide a deeper insight into the space - time geometry and facilitate generation of exact solutions to the field equations .",
    "conformal collineation is defined by , @xmath8 where @xmath9 signifies the lie derivative along @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the conformal factor . in particular",
    ", @xmath12 is a special conformal killing vector ( sckv ) if @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "other subcases are homothetic vector ( hv ) if @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and killing vector ( kv ) if @xmath17 . here ; and , denote the covariant and ordinary derivatives , respectively .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "einstein field equations are obtained for charged strange quark matter attached to the string cloud in the spherical symmetric space - time . in section 3 einstein field equations are solved for the same matter via conformal motions depending on conformal factor i.e. , @xmath11 . in section 4 , concluding remarks are given .",
    "let us consider a static distribution of matter represented by charged spherical symmetric matter which may be strange quark matter attached to the string cloud",

    "we will take strange quark matter energy density instead of particle energy density in the string cloud . in this case from eq .",

    "now we shall assume that space - time admits a one - parameter group of conformal motions ( eq .",

    "to match the line element ( [ eq33 ] ) with the reissner - nordstrm metric across the boundary @xmath70 we require continuity of gravitational potential @xmath71 at @xmath70    @xmath72    and also we require the continuity of the electric field , which leads to @xmath73    from eq .",
