    "one of the fascinating topics in general relativity is the dynamical formation of black holes from gravitationally collapsing matter .",
    "a remarkable breakthrough that emerged from such studies is mathematical theorem @xcite dubbed `` singularity theorem '' . according to the theorem , if a trapped surface forms during the collapse of physically reasonable matter , the resultant spacetime geometry inevitably leads to the creation of a singularity , assuming that there are no closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) .",
    "this fact , however , does not imply that the collapse process is necessarily accompanied with the formation of black holes since there is no reason that the trapped surface hides the singularity from distant observers .",
    "thus it has been suggested that a black hole must be formed from gravitationally collapsing physical matter with generic initial data in order to preserve future predictability beyond singularity formation , at least for distant observers .",
    "this is called the `` cosmic censorship hypothesis '' @xcite . the issue of whether or not this hypothesis is true remains unsolved in the context of the general relativity  there are some counter - examples against the hypothesis , producing a naked singularity @xcite .    on the other hand , in the three - dimensional einstein s gravity with a cosmological constant",
    ", it has been shown that the cosmic censorship violation happens under a broad variety of initial conditions from the gravitationally collapsing shells of diverse static @xcite and the rotating @xcite matter configurations . as the shell collapses its energy density ( and pressure , if any ) diverges in finite proper time .",
    "the interesting point is that even if the exterior space develops no curvature singularity ( since the exterior three - dimensional spacetime has constant curvature ) , the energy - momentum tensor of the shell diverges in finite proper time , where the time - evolution of the shell s equation of motion breaks down . as a consequence ,",
    "this leads to a violation of cosmic censorship in that there is no definite way to evolve the equation of motion beyond this point and a cauchy horizon appears if the singularity is not screened by an event horizon .",
    "this behavior also appears in the previous studies of the gravitationally collapsing dust ball in three - dimensions @xcite and the topological black hole formation in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "as seen in previous studies , dealing with a singularity might cause some troubles in studying physics in the context of , at least , general relativity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the theory of gravity we study is adhere to the riemmanian geometry that has a drawback in handling a singular point .",
    "this is the reason why the quantum gravity is strongly required .",
    "there are two different prospects toward quantum gravity so far  string theory and loop quantum gravity , in both which there should be somewhat noncommutative modification of spacetime geometry that possesses a symplectic structure . in this sense",
    ", such a modification of gravity might resolve the singularity problem .    in this paper , we study the formation of schwarzschild black hole from gravitationally collapsing shells of polytropic matter and chaplygin gas . and",
    "we study the formation of noncommutative schwarzschild black hole slightly modified by the smeared gravitational source and classify the possible scenarios for the black hole ( or naked singular shell ) formation in the various parameter regions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : shell ] , we present a shell formalism and an introduction of the smeared gravitational source that yields noncommutative schwarzschild black hole . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ss ] , we investigate gravitational collapse scenarios for collapsing polytropic and the chaplygin gas shells , in which it can form either a black hole or a naked singularity , depending on its initial data . in sec .

    "more precisely , the shell s equation of motion can be reexpressed in terms of a point - like particles motion under the effective potential .",
    "the collapse scenarios of the shell can be analyzed by investigating the behavior of the effective potential .",
    "on the other hand , when we consider the geometrical structure at the region with strong gravitational fields such as black hole horizon or curvature singularity , it is expected that the noncommutativity of spacetimes can remove the point - source structure due to the noncommutative effect of @xmath26 , where @xmath27=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] @xcite with @xmath28 @xcite , where @xmath26 and @xmath29 are a constant and the spacetime dimension @xcite .",

    "we first consider the schwarzschild black hole formation from collapsing shells with the polytropic equation of state , including the perfect fluid and the chaplygin gas .",
    "we assume that the metrics in both regions , @xmath37 ( outside the shell ) and @xmath38 ( inside the shell ) are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are exterior and interior metrics can be assumed to be a vacuum solution .",
    "the most general solution is given by the schwarzschild black hole one , @xmath42 .",

    "[ fig : sspfshell ] .",
    "note that the energy density diverges at @xmath112 and @xmath106 ( @xmath106 only ) leads to the divergence of the effective potential at those points for finite @xmath76 ( infinite @xmath76 ) .",
    "so the intrinsic ricci scalar on the shell @xmath113 = \\frac{2}{x^2 } \\left [ 2x\\ddot{x }   + \\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{{\\mathcal r}_0 ^ 2}\\right ] = \\frac{2}{x^2 } \\left [ -x \\frac{d } { dx}v_{eff}(x )",
    "-v_{eff}(x ) + \\frac{1}{{\\mathcal r}_{0}^2}\\right]\\ ] ] is also singular at the same points .    for perfect fluids ,",
    "there are four options in the collapse scenario , depending on the equation - of - state parameter and shell s initial data .",
    "first , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sspfshell ] ( a ) , for @xmath114 or @xmath115 , the effective potential is convex up , so the collapse scenario has three choices :",
    "( i ) there are two roots  if the shell s initial position is in the left - hand side , it always collapses to a point at @xmath106 , creating a curvature singularity while the shell s position is in the right - hand side , it expands indefinitely , ( ii ) there is one degenerate root ",
    "the shell is in the metastable root , which leads to either collapse or expansion , ( iii ) there are no roots  the shell either collapses to a point or expands indefinitely , depending on its initial data . in above all cases ,",
    "if we assume the black hole in the exterior spacetime and flat interior spacetimes , the black hole can be formed by collapsing perfect fluid shells .    for @xmath116 ,",
    "the effective potential negatively diverges at @xmath106 while it diverges positively at @xmath117 , which implies that the shell always collapses to a point regardless of its initial condition ",
    "i.e. , the black hole can be formed all the time , regardless of its initial data . for the values of @xmath109 and @xmath118 , the behavior of the potential has the same pattern in that it diverges at @xmath106 and approaches a finite value at asymptotic region .",
    "therefore , if there is one root , the shell always collapses to a point regardless of its initial condition while if not , the shell either collapses or expands indefinitely , depending on the initial data , which implies the critical phenomenon of the black hole formation in that this behavior depends on the magnitude between black hole masses and the shell s initial masses .    on the other hand , for the case of finite @xmath76 s ,",
    "one of interesting features is that the singularity at @xmath106 is shifted to finite position of @xmath112 , so the spherical singular shell is formed after the collapse when @xmath119 while for @xmath120 , the behavior of the potential is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : sspfshell ] ( b ) and ( d ) .    as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqnmotion ] ) , the equation of motion is highly nonlinear to obtain an exact solution but its numerical solution can be easily obtained since it is the first - order differential equation however the effective potential is extremely complicated . some numerical behaviors for a few parameter sets",
    "are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : numsol ] by using the fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "the previous analysis for the chaplygin gas shell also shows the similar behaviors as studied before . the crucial point of this collapsing behavior is whether or not the matter is pressureless . as shown in three - dimensional case",
    "@xcite , the pressure of collapsing matter can stretch the singularity to finite size since the curvature and the energy density on the shell diverges at that point .",
    "this singularity can be screened by an event horizon for an appropriate initial data while it is equivalently possible to be exposed outside the geometry , depending on initial condition , which might require a certain modification of formalism beyond the classical theory of gravity .",
    "in this section we consider the noncommutative schwarzschild black hole formation from collapsing shells , including the new matter related to the noncommutativity as well as the polytropic matter on the shell .",
    "this is the generalization of the shell collapsing on the noncommutative background .",
    "notice that to solve the junction equation we need new matter different with the polytropic matter on the shell , whose energy density depending on the noncommutative parameter @xmath26 and the shell position @xmath121 will be calculated .",
    "another interesting point of this section is to check weather the noncommutative effect of the background can get rid of the naked singular shell .    by introducing the smeared energy density ( [ eq : rhotheta ] ) to the bulk , we assume that the metrics in both regions , @xmath37 ( outside the shell ) and @xmath38 ( inside the shell ) are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are exterior and interior metrics that can be assumed to be an appropriate solution of the einstein equation , so we set @xmath122 where @xmath123 is an incomplete gamma function defined as @xmath124    note that the metric ( [ eq : f ] ) becomes the standard schwarzschild metric in the limit of @xmath125 ( commutative limit ) . on the other hand , the surface energy - momentum tensor ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) should be modified by @xmath126 and @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the energy density and pressure of the polytropic - type matter in the previous section .",
    "then , the junction equation becomes @xmath130 the equation for the energy density related to the noncommutativity is reduced to @xmath131 using the fact that the pressure @xmath132 can be rewritten as @xmath133 the energy density becomes @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the value at @xmath136 .",
    "note that the above energy density is different with that of the polytropic matter , which means that for describing the shell collapse in the noncommutative background consistently we should introduce new matter smeared in the hypersurface .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath137 , this matter behaves like the cosmological constant .",
    "plugging this into eq .",
    "( [ eq:4.3 ] ) yields the equation describing the shell s motion @xmath138 with the effective potential @xmath139 where @xmath61 is given by @xmath140^{-n } } +   \\bar{\\rho}\\ e^{-\\frac{{\\mathcal r}^2-{\\mathcal r}_0 ^ 2}{\\theta } } .\\ ] ] in the case of @xmath141 , the energy density becomes @xmath142 here if we set @xmath143 and @xmath144 as before , then one finds the energy density @xmath145^{-n } + \\bar{\\rho } e^{-\\frac{{\\mathcal r}_0 ^ 2}{\\theta } ( x^2 - 1)}\\ ] ] and the behavior of the effective potential with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : rhotheta ] ) is similar but slightly modified by the noncommutative effect of @xmath26 . for the generic polytropic matters with @xmath107 ,",
    "there exists a singular point at @xmath146 while it is not the case for the perfect fluid of @xmath147 . due to the finiteness of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhotheta ] ) , the noncommutative correction does not affect the typical shape of the effective potential coming from the polytropic matter .",
    "in other words , the noncommutative energy density can not remove the singularity caused by the polytropic matters .",
    "the effective potential for some specific parameters and difference due to the noncommutative effect are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ncpot ] .",
    "the main effect of @xmath26 parameter ( noncommutative effect of collapsing matter ) is shown in rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : ncpot ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sspfshell ] ( a ) , it is found that the convex of potential in @xmath148 has always negative value for some numerical checks in the commutative case . provided we introduce the @xmath26-effect , then the potential barrier in this region appears as shown in rhs of fig .",
    "[ fig : ncpot ] .",
    "anyway , as mentioned previously , the @xmath26-effect can not alter the shell s collapsing behavior . though the noncommutative effect does not get rid of the singularity of the effective potential , it may be helpful to make a black hole solution before the shell touches the singular point . to see this",
    ", we first calculate the black hole horizon @xmath149 such that @xmath150 in which the horizon depends on @xmath26 .",
    "for example , for some fixed numeric values ( here @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath78 ) , the position of the horizon is shifted as @xmath156 since @xmath157 for the parameters we are considering above , some collapsing scenarios are possible :    @xmath158 for the choice of @xmath159 , since the black hole horizon is only located between the origin and the potential wall , if the initial shell starts collapsing in @xmath160 , it always forms a noncommutative schwarzschild geometry .",
    "however , the shell s initial position is outside the wall , the collapsing shell will always encounter the naked singularity at @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath158 for the choice of @xmath161 , since the black hole horizon is located at @xmath162 , the shell starting from @xmath163 either forms a black hole or encounters a singularity at @xmath112  this picture can not be allowed since its initial geometry already includes a singular point in the manifold .",
    "another option is that the shell s initial position is located at @xmath164 , for which the shell can form a naked singularity at the final stage of the collapse .",
    "@xmath158 for the choice of @xmath165 case , the black hole horizon is outside the singular point at @xmath166 , so the shell can form a black hole as the shell collapses .",
    "all these scenarios are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nceff ] .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nceff ] ( c ) , as the noncommutative effect becomes strong , the black hole horizon has a large value so that the shell s collapse can make the black hole before touching the singular point .",
    "the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ eq : motionv ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : potv ] ) and ( [ eq : rhotheta ] ) is highly nonlinear and complicated even if it is simply the first - order differential equation . instead of its analytic solution",
    ", we can estimate numerical solutions for some appropriate initial data and fixed parameters .",
    "[ fig : ncnumsol ] shows that the collapsing shell of the polytropic matter and the smeared gravitational source can form a noncommutative schwarzschild black hole .",
    "note that the possibility of a negative energy density that violates the weak energy condition can be also took into account . indeed",
    "the study of such configurations has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the freely falling dust cloud with a negative energy density collapses to the black hole with the negative adm mass and different topological structure .",
    "more precisely , the exterior topological geometry is set to be the solution of einstein equations with cosmological constant @xmath167 with mass parameter @xmath168 and topology of @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is a two - surface of genus @xmath171 .",
    "then a straightforward computation reveals @xmath172 , which shows that the resulting geometry from freely falling dust cloud of negative energy density should be a negative mass black hole .",
    "@xcite for more details on the topological black holes including the negative mass black hole .",
    "concerning the negative energy density @xcite , the aspect seems to be unchanged comparing to the case of the positive energy density .",
    "indeed , a short glance at the effective potential in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pot1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pot2 ] ) shows that the initial energy density is quadratic , implying that the negative energy density does not alter the previous result of the case of @xmath173 .",
    "however , the total energy system must be positive , which implies that @xmath174 clearly leading @xmath168 .",
    "the main reason that ref .",
    "@xcite can allow the negative mass is the only topological reason of the geometry since the system can produce the positive total energy with the combination of the negative mass and the topological genus as mentioned above .",
    "for this reason , the system we are considering in this paper can not accept the negative mass case .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the gravitational shell collapse problem with the smeared gravitational source in the context of the mild noncommutative modification of the space .",
    "the collapsing matters with the most generic polytropic equation of state and the chaplygin gas were considered , which leads to formation of either black hole or naked singularity , depending on its initial data . moreover ,",
    "the existence of the nontrivial pressure yields the stretch of singularity , which produces the singular shell with a finite size , regardless of an event horizon . provided it is cloaked by an event horizon , the collapsing shell can form a black hole while it forms a naked singular shell if not ",
    "this crucially depends on the initial condition .",
    "this feature has been already observed in the lower dimensional theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "when considering the noncommutative effect , we showed that though the noncommutativity can not remove the singularity caused by the polytropic matter , it makes the collapsing shell becomes a black hole before touching the singular point .",
    "as studied before , the introduction of the smeared gravitational source and the corresponding slight modification of the schwarzschild geometry do not offer a crucial prescription for the treatment of naked singularities in the shell collapse formalism . considering the smeared source in the presence of @xmath26-effect",
    "can be regarded as _",
    "so - called `` semi - noncommutative '' _ approach since the matter part of einstein s equation has @xmath26-effect while the shell formalism from the geometry parts of einstein s equation has no such terms .",
    "therefore , in order to deal with this issue completely , we , somehow , should modify the gravitational action and have a modified shell formalism .",
    "one of possible ways of doing this is to add some higher curvature terms to the einstein - hilbert action , which can alter the junction equation .",
    "this scenario can be viable for three - or five - dimensional cases because we can add the gravitational chern - simons ( gcs ) terms or gauss - bonnet terms to the einstein - hilbert action . in four dimensions , no viable expression of higher curvature terms",
    "is known due to the topological reason . in this sense ,",
    "a recent suggestion of the horava - lifshits gravity @xcite might draw a great interest since the theory has highly - powered curvature terms in the action . another way to exit the issue is to consider the another alternate theory of gravitation such as the scalar tensor theory of brans - dicke type , which clearly alters the junction equations on the shell . in these all possibilities , it is worthwhile to study whether or not the singularity issue is resolved , which is being in progress .",
    "however , above all possibilities might be temporal prescriptions of handling a singularity in that those corrections only hold in the context of the _ effective theory_. the most fundamental solution to the singularity and the cosmic censorship should be suggested through the full quantum theory of gravity .",
