    "the discovery of thousands of exoplanet systems from _ kepler _ and other missions has confirmed the ubiquity and diversity of planetary systems in our galaxy .",
    "the dominant physical processes that lead to the observed configurations of exoplanet systems , however , remain unclear .",
    "a central question , for both high and low - mass planets , is whether what we see reflects the in situ growth of planets from a population of planetesimals , or is instead determined largely by migration at a later stage .",
    "answering this question robustly requires determining , from protoplanetary disk initial conditions , where and when planetesimals form .    in the  bottom - up \" model for planet formation",
    ", planets are built through several key stages , beginning with the coagulation of small particles into larger particles and particle aggregates , the formation of planetesimals from these solids , and the growth of planetesimals from accretion into larger bodies that become terrestrial planets and the cores of gas giants . in the first step ,",
    "the collisions of particles through brownian and turbulent motions lead to their growth into larger bodies .",
    "this process is efficient at producing solids of sizes @xmath7 mm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent work has shown that it may be possible for solids to grow to @xmath7cm - m sizes as they drift through radially varying turbulence @xcite , though interior to the snow line , such growth is difficult and solids likely remain stunted at mm sizes @xcite .",
    "the propensity of these solids to grow in size only goes so far , however , and forming larger bodies of km size scales or larger ( i.e. , planetesimal scales ) faces two theoretical difficulties .",
    "first , if particles grow to sufficiently large sizes ( @xmath7 meter sizes at 1 au ) , they experience a significant head - wind from the sub - keplerian rotating gas , which causes them to lose angular momentum and rapidly spiral into the star @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been invoked to counteract this drift .",
    "for example , pressure bumps due to zonal flows @xcite , ice lines ( @xcite ; but see @xcite and @xcite ) , and abrupt transitions in ionization fraction @xcite may stop or slow this radial drift and may even be required given observations showing the presence of these particles at large disk radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , even if these particle traps are efficient at slowing radial drift , particles still can not easily grow beyond mm - cm sizes .",
    "a combination of laboratory experiments ( primarily on silicates ) and modeling shows that particles within this size range do not easily stick together , and instead fragment or bounce @xcite . whether this is also",
    "the case for icy particles is less clear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a promising route toward surpassing these difficulties involves instabilities of aerodynamically coupled systems of gas and solid particles . as the gas removes angular momentum from the particles via a headwind",
    ", the particles experience inward radial drift .",
    "however , the back - reaction of the particle momentum on the gas causes particle over - densities to experience less gas drag as these over - densities act to boost the gas and reduce their own headwind .",
    "therefore , regions of higher particle density will experience slower radial drift , leading to a pile up of solids at various radii .",
    "this mechanism is the essence of what is known as the streaming instability @xcite .",
    "the streaming instability has been studied analytically in the linear regime @xcite and in the non - linear regime via numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the initial growth of the instability does not involve self - gravity , and in this limit , two and three - dimensional calculations have been used to quantify the strength of clumping as a function of the physical @xcite , and numerical parameters , e.g. , resolution @xcite . in particular , @xcite and @xcite carried out numerical calculations of the streaming instability without self - gravity and found that the instability generally leads to efficient particle clumping when the dimensionless stopping time ( i.e. , the stopping time multiplied by the orbital frequency ) is @xmath8 and the height - integrated solid - to - gas ratio is super - solar .",
    "furthermore , the instability occurs for a wide range in background gas pressure gradients , but for a given metallicity , it favors smaller gradients @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional calculations that include the mutual gravitational forces between particles have been used to study how planetesimals form @xcite . while many characteristics of planetesimal formation have yet to be fully explored ,",
    "these studies have generally shown that planetesimals with masses consistent with dwarf planets and planetesimals in the main asteroid belt and kuiper belt can form after the streaming instability generates sufficiently strong clumps that self - gravity can take over ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have established the streaming instability as the leading candidate mechanism for the efficient formation of planetesimals .",
    "many critical questions , however , remain open .",
    "these include whether the streaming instability  in isolation , or in concert with large - scale structures such as zonal flows @xcite  can form planetesimals in the inner disk , where the dimensionless stopping time of mm - sized particles @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of the initial planetesimal mass and size distributions on physical properties , such as @xmath10 , the metallicity , and gas - phase turbulence is an open issue . indeed , characterizing these distributions is of substantial importance to explaining properties of both the main asteroid belt and the kuiper belt planetesimal populations . to - date",
    ", simulations of the streaming instability in the presence of particle self - gravity @xcite have revealed a shallower planetesimal size distribution than what is inferred from main belt and kuiper belt observations @xcite .",
    "however , an extensive systematic survey of the dependence of this distribution on physical parameters has yet to be carried out .",
    "purely numerical issues are also of interest .",
    "the relative strengths and weakness of different numerical schemes are well - characterized in a variety of situations , including low and high - mach number turbulence , but much less is known in the more complex situation where we have multiple phases , aerodynamic coupling and self - gravity .",
    "all previous simulations of planetesimal formation that have included self - gravity have used high - order finite difference methods ( implemented in the pencil code ) . here ,",
    "we instead combine particle self - gravity with a higher order godunov hydrodynamic scheme ( implemented in the athena code ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to study planetesimal formation and again address the dependence of planetesimal mass and size distributions on numerical effects .    in this paper , the first of a series",
    ", we describe our implementation of particle self - gravity within the athena code , and present results from a baseline set of 3d simulations .",
    "our primary focus is on independently verifying ( and in some cases extending ) prior numerical simulations of streaming - initiated planetesimal formation , and hence we start with parameter choices that match those in the existing literature .",
    "we specifically address the convergence of the initial planetesimal mass function with numerical resolution , and the effect of varying the strength of self - gravity as compared to tidal shear .",
    "we also study whether the results depend on _ when _ in the simulation particle self - gravity is turned on , given that it is common ( and computationally expedient ) to do so at a relatively late time when the non - self - gravitating streaming instability is already strongly non - linear .",
    "there has been some study of the impact of this approximation @xcite , but a detailed investigation of the effects of pre - gravity conditions on the outcome of planetesimal formation has not yet been performed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "our methodology is described in detail in section  [ method ] , which includes a description of the numerical algorithm and the implementation of particle self - gravity , two test problems to check this implementation , and a description of our streaming instability calculations . in section  [ results ] , we present our results from each set of calculations , and we discuss these results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "we wrap up with a summary and conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",

    "in this section , we explain our methodology .",

    "we then present tests of our particle self - gravity module , followed by a description of our set up , parameters , and diagnostics for the local , streaming instability simulations that we carry out in this paper .",
    "our simulations use athena , a second - order accurate godunov flux - conservative code for solving the equations of hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the simulations we have carried out here neglect magnetic fields , and we use the hydrodynamics module of athena .",
    "we use the athena configuration that includes the dimensionally unsplit corner transport upwind method of @xcite coupled with the third - order in space piecewise parabolic method of @xcite .",
    "we use the hllc riemann solver to calculate the numerical fluxes @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the base athena algorithm and the results of various test problems are given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the simulations employ a local shearing box approximation .",
    "the shearing box models a co - rotating disk patch whose size is small compared to the radial distance from the central object , @xmath18 .",

    "the local patch co - rotates with an angular velocity @xmath24 corresponding to the orbital frequency at @xmath18 , the center of the box ; see @xcite .",
    "there are two sets of equations to solve .",
    "comprising the first set are the continuity and momentum equation for the gas dynamics :    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the mass density , @xmath28 is the momentum density , @xmath29 is the gas pressure , @xmath30 is the identity matrix , @xmath31 is the ( dimensional ) stopping time of the particles , and @xmath32 is the shear parameter , defined as @xmath33ln@xmath34ln@xmath35 .",

    "the source terms in equation  ( [ momentum_eqn ] ) correspond to radial tidal forces ( gravity and centrifugal ) , vertical gravity , the coriolis force , and the feedback from the particle momentum onto the gas .",
    "the feedback term consists of the local particle mass density @xmath39 , the difference between the particle velocity @xmath40 and gas velocity , and the stopping time @xmath31 of particles due to gas drag .",
    "as we describe below , this feedback term is calculated at the location of every particle and then distributed to the gas grid points .",
    "the second set of equations describes the particle evolution .",
    "the equation of motion for particle @xmath41 is given by    @xmath42    where the prime denotes a frame in which the background shear velocity has been subtracted .",
    "this is part of the orbital advection scheme @xcite , which has been implemented for the gas dynamics as well .",
    "the @xmath43 term accounts for the inward radial drift of particles resulting from a gas headwind , where @xmath44 is the fraction of the keplerian velocity by which the orbital velocity of particles is reduced ( see section  [ setup ] ) . in real disks",
    ", this headwind results from a radial pressure gradient that causes the gas to orbit at sub - keplerian speeds while the particles continue to orbit at keplerian velocities .",
    "however , such a radial pressure gradient is inconsistent with the radial ( shearing ) periodic boundary conditions in the shearing box model .",
    "following @xcite , we circumvent this issue by imposing an inward force on the particles , resulting in the @xmath43 term as described above . as a result ,",
    "both the particles and gas ( azimuthal ) velocities are shifted to slightly higher values ( by @xmath43 ) than what would be present in a real disk , but the essential physics of differential motion between the gas and particles is accurately captured .",

    "note that this reconstruction is the same method employed to remap the fluid quantities in the radial ghost zones as part of the shearing - periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "in the vertical direction , the solution to equation  ( [ poisson ] ) is found using the green s function of the poisson equation for a horizontal sheet of sinusoidal source mass , as described in detail in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the authors of that work developed this method to calculate the potential of self - gravitating gas , but we have trivially extended this same algorithm to use the particle mass density instead of the gas density .    with these methods in hand , the potential is calculated as follows .",

    "in calculating the 3d fft s , a domain of size @xmath55 is used ; twice the vertical domain size is required for the use of green s function in solving the potential with vacuum boundaries . finally , the gravitational potential is mapped back to the original time using the third - order conservative remap that was used on the particle mass density .",
    "the resulting @xmath48 is a cell - centered quantity , and we calculate the forces at the cell center using a central finite difference method over three grid cells in every direction .",
    "thus , the force ( equation  [ grav_force ] ) in the @xmath50-direction in cell @xmath56 is calculated by    @xmath57    and similarly for the @xmath54 and @xmath51 directions .",
    "the forces then have to be interpolated back to the location of the particles , and we again use the tsc method .",
    "we add the self - gravity force to the particles simultaneously with the drag force .",
    "the boundary conditions are the shearing - periodic boundaries in the radial direction , purely periodic in the azimuthal direction , and a modified outflow condition in the vertical direction in which the gas density is extrapolated via an exponential function into the grid zones ( * ? ? ?",

    "the boundary conditions for the gravitational potential are essentially the same as the hydrodynamic variables ; shearing - periodic in @xmath50 and purely periodic in @xmath54 .",
    "the vertical boundary conditions are open , and the potential is calculated in the ghost zones via a third order extrapolation .      in this section , we carry out two tests of our numerical algorithm for particle self - gravity . the first test is the collapse of a uniform density sphere of particles .",

    "we then explore parameter space by varying one parameter in each simulation subset ( demarcated in table  [ tbl : sims ] by separate boxes ) . in the first subset , we vary the numerical resolution and the number of particles .",

    "the first is the maximum value of the volume - averaged particle mass density , @xmath131 , and the second is a weighted version of the volume - averaged particle mass density , defined as @xmath132 . in general , these two quantities behave similarly , but while the maximum density has been used more frequently in the literature to track the degree of clumping via the streaming instability , it can be largely affected by a small number of grid cells ( or even one cell ) , and the latter quantity is more representative of the degree of clumping over the entire domain . using both of these diagnostics in concert , we chose restart times of @xmath133 ( the  low clumping \" case ) , @xmath130 ( medium clumping ; this is the same as the fiducial simulation ) , and @xmath134 ( high clumping ) .",
    "we also run one case with self - gravity turned on from the beginning state @xmath135 .",
    "all of these runs are labelled by the numerical resolution employed , the strength of self - gravity , and any other modifying information .",
    "for example , run si128-g0.05-low_clump has 128 zones per dimension , @xmath127 , and is initiated from a  low clumping \" state , as described above .",
    "all simulations are shown in table  [ tbl : sims ] with the parameters outlined and any additional , relevant comments .",
    "there are several diagnostics employed in section  [ results ] that we now describe .",
    "first is the maximum particle mass density , as described above , as a proxy for the degree of clumping during the streaming instability .",
    "another often employed quantity is the particle mass surface density , which is simply the integral of @xmath131 over the vertical extent of the domain .",
    "most of our diagnostics require that we locate gravitationally bound mass clumps ( after self - gravity has been included ) and calculate their mass . following the basic arguments in @xcite",
    ", we calculate @xmath118 at a given time and use a peak - finding algorithm to locate local maxima in the surface density above a certain threshold .",
    "the mass of any given clump is determined by calculating a circular region surrounding the clump and iteratively increasing the radius of this region until the mass enclosed within it equals the mass of a clump that is bound by self - gravity compared to tidal effects .",
    "mathematically , we seek a radius @xmath35 such that the tidal term , @xmath136 , and the gravitational acceleration of a test particle at the edge of the clump s hill sphere , @xmath137 are in balance ;    @xmath138    when the mass enclosed within our test circle equals @xmath139 , we set @xmath35 as the hill radius and @xmath139 as the clump mass .",
    "there are two limitations to our algorithm .",
    "first , it has difficulty determining the masses of clumps when two or more clumps are very close together in the @xmath140 plane .",
    "this is alleviated somewhat by setting a minimum distance , equivalent to the hill radius of a 0.1 @xmath141 mass ( which , as we will see , is consistent with masses at the higher end of the resulting mass distributions ) , below which the algorithm counts two clumps as being one .",
    "furthermore , we subtract contributions of neighboring clumps that are beyond this minimum distance but still within each clump s hill radius . this limitation with overlapping clumps",
    "is particularly troublesome at early times when gravitationally bound clumps have yet to fully form , yet there are still peaks in @xmath118 .",
    "the error associated with overlapping clumps commonly manifests itself as very sharp peaks or troughs in the time evolution of the clump masses .",
    "while this limitation causes issues on short timescales when clumps temporarily interact , it does not affect the clump mass on long timescales .",
    "as a first order approach to remove this effect , we apply a simple boxcar smoothing technique to the time evolution of clump masses in all that follows .",
    "the second limitation arises from applying a two - dimensional approach to a fully three - dimensional problem .",
    "however , even though clumps exist in three dimensions , the particle layer is vertically thin enough to make the two - dimensional clump finding approach a good approximation .",
    "indeed , the algorithm appears to do a sufficient job at finding clumps that remain gravitationally bound as the simulation progresses and does not find too many false positives .",
    "furthermore , as shown in section  [ results ] , the diagnostics that employ this algorithm return results roughly consistent with @xcite , lending support to the idea that our analysis works reasonably well .    from this clump finding algorithm",
    ", we calculate both the time history of the mass of the formed clumps and the mass distribution function for these clumps .",
    "many of the simulations form only small numbers of clumps , so we seek a simple functional form to fit to the mass distribution .",
    "consistent with prior work , a power - law differential mass distribution ,    @xmath142    works well . here , @xmath143 is a constant that for the purposes of this paper is arbitrary .",
    "we also consider the cumulative mass distribution ,    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is another arbitrary constant .",
    "we can easily translate equation  ( [ mass_dist ] ) to a size distribution to find @xmath146 where @xmath147 .    under the assumption that the data is drawn from a power - law distribution",
    ", the power law index @xmath148 of the differential distribution can be determined directly from the set of measured masses @xmath149 using a maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from equation  ( 3.1 ) in @xcite",

    "the error is given by their equation ( 3.2 ) ,    @xmath152    using the mle for @xmath148 avoids any binning step , which can introduce bias into the estimate . to visually represent the differential distribution , however",
    ", we make a local estimate of @xmath153 by taking @xmath154 to be half the distance in the mass co - ordinate between a given planetesimal and its nearest neighbors .",
    "a least squares linear fit in log - log space to @xmath155 vs @xmath139 gives an alternate measure of @xmath148 , that is very roughly consistent but generally slightly smaller .",
    "irrespective of the statistical methods used , two cautions are in order .",
    "first , the underlying distribution of planetesimal masses formed in the simulations can not in reality be a simple power - law , because there is zero probability of forming a body with a mass greater than the total mass of solids in the domain .",
    "if the actual distribution is a truncated power - law , then our naive fit will over - estimate the value of @xmath148 .",
    "second , our lower resolution runs form rather small number of planetesimals , and any method for estimating @xmath148 in this situation is noisy , possibly biased , and liable to return a non - gaussian distribution of slope estimates .",
    "simple experiments suggest that only the higher resolution runs , for which there are on order 100 planetesimals , can be expected to return robust estimates of the distribution .",
    "in this section , we present the results from our various parameter studies .",
    "we first describe the properties of the fiducial simulation si128-g0.05 in detail , followed by quantifying the effects of changing the strength of gravity , the numerical resolution , and the degree of clumping when self - gravity is initiated .",

    "we describe some properties of our fiducial run , si128-g0.05 .",
    "self - gravity is switched on at @xmath156 , after which the mutual gravitational attraction between particles causes the particle density to increase ; in units of the initial mid - plane gas density , the maximum particle density rapidly increases to @xmath157 , and then slowly increases to @xmath158 afterwards .     and is measured from the initialization of self - gravity onward .",
    "we find general agreement with a similar run in @xcite , but there are some differences in the initial growth rate of planetesimals.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a time progression of the particle surface density is shown by a series of snapshots in fig .  [ snapshots_fiducial ] .",

[ fiducial_mass ] ; both the total mass and maximum mass are shown .",
    "this evolution can be compared to fig .",
    "13 of @xcite .",

    "we find that there are 13 clumps , and roughly , the number of these clumps increase towards the low mass end .    choosing the point at which to calculate",
    "the mass distribution is a bit subtle .",
    "our general approach is to visually inspect the particle mass density ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ snapshots_fiducial ] ) and choose a time shortly after planetesimals have formed ( so as to not sample later times when these planetesimals have substantially grown in mass due to accretion of smaller particles and/or mergers ) and have become separate objects ( i.e. , no significant overlap with the over density of mass from which they formed ) .",
    "we have calculated the mass distribution at three different times ; @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 . while the large scatter in the differential mass makes a comparison between the different snapshots and a precise quantification of the power law slope difficult , we find approximate  by - eye \" agreement in the values of @xmath139 and @xmath155 . to reduce the noise inherent in the differential mass distributions",

    "we note , however , that the recent simulations of @xcite  in which collapsed planetesimals were replaced with sink particles  yielded roughly consistent values of @xmath148 and @xmath32 as compared to our @xmath4 simulation .",
    "thus , it would seem that there are no systematic errors in the determination of @xmath148 with high resolution simulations .",
    "the largest scales in the box may also play an important role in properties of collapsed planetesimals . indeed",
    ", it has been recently shown through non - self - gravitating simulations that the domain size influences the temporal and spatial properties of particle clumping during the non - linear state of the streaming instability @xcite .",
    "it is entirely conceivable that such effects will influence the outcome of the gravitational collapse phase , and we are currently pursuing such investigations ( li et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "numerical effects aside , however , it is possible that the size distribution of planetesimals formed from gravitational collapse is not universal , and may be different in the physical environment relevant to the asteroid or kuiper belts .",
    "the streaming instability can produce strong clumping of solids across a wide region in the parameter space of metallicity , radial gas pressure gradient and particle size @xcite .",
    "these parameters are expected to vary substantially with disk radius ( for example , the dimensionless stopping time for particles in the asteroid belt region is likely to be much smaller than for the kuiper belt region ) , and this may result in different size distributions after gravitational collapse .",
    "it is also conceivable that the size distribution is a function of how unstable the disk is to the streaming instability and gravitational collapse .",
    "we have simulated a system in which a significant fraction of the total mass of solids forms planetesimals on a time scale of just @xmath196 .",
    "meteoritic evidence from the asteroid belt , conversely , suggests a broad spread in the formation times of primitive material @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as implying that planetesimal precursors persist in the disk over time scales more akin to @xmath197 .",
    "it is not known whether a marginally unstable system would form the same planetesimal mass function as the one that we have simulated .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting that the size distribution at the end of the gravitational collapse can be subsequently modified by the longer term accretion of planetesimals and smaller solids .",
    "the effects of this accretion depend on the evolving size distribution of solids and the evolution of the gas , including its turbulent state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the size distribution at the end of the collapse phase , as studied here , is important as input for these longer term accretion studies .",
    "we have developed and tested a module for the mutual gravitational interaction of particles in the athena code and applied it to preliminary studies of the streaming instability under the influence of particle gravity .",
    "as this is the first study of planetesimal formation with the athena code , we have carried out a basic parameter sweep in order to provide a baseline of calculations and results from which to spawn further investigations and with which to compare the results already present in the literature .    in this paper , we have varied the numerical resolution , the relative strength of gravity and tidal effects , and the degree of clumping induced by the streaming instability before the activation of particle self - gravity . while we will follow up this study in future papers to explore more parameters , we can draw some preliminary conclusions from this work .    1 .",
    "the streaming instability leads to enhanced particle clumping , after which the mutual gravitational attraction between solid particles leads to the formation of a number of bound planetesimals .",
    "2 .   for the choice of metallicity and stopping time used here",
    ", the masses of these planetesimals range from @xmath198 to @xmath199 .",
    "the typical radii of these planetesimals are 50 km to a few hundred km .",
    "3 .   where a direct comparison is possible",
    ", we find excellent agreement between planetesimal properties in our athena simulations and those carried out with the pencil code .",
    "4 .   as resolution",
    "is increased , more planetesimals are produced at lower masses and smaller radii , while the high end mass of the distribution remains approximately the same .",
    "there is no significant trend of the power law index @xmath148 with resolution .",
    "the values of @xmath148 fall within the range @xmath169@xmath200 .",
    "the power law slope of the size distribution for the highest resolution simulation is @xmath191 , which is significantly shallower than that measured for both the main asteroid belt ( @xmath188 ) and the classical kuiper belt ( cold population ; @xmath201 hot population ; @xmath202 ) .",
    "varying the relative strength of gravity through the parameter @xmath123 changes the mass range of planetesimals produced .",
    "the value of @xmath148 does not appear to have any consistent trend with @xmath123 .",
    "the properties of planetesimals appear largely independent of the initial degree of clumping before gravity takes over , justifying the method employed here and in various papers by johansen and co - authors of activating particle self - gravity after the streaming instability has already produced clumps .",
    "as this is an initial step into planetesimal studies with athena , we have only explored a few parameters .",
    "a more complete study of planetesimal properties will require varying other parameters , both physical ( e.g. , metallicity , particle size , radial pressure gradient ) and numerical ( e.g. , boundary conditions and domain size ) .",
    "we will address these issues in future publications .",
    "a more serious uncertainty lies in the relatively small mass and size range produced by the moderate resolution @xmath203 simulations , which generally spans only a decade in mass . while we were able to alleviate the resulting issue of small number statistics associated with this limited mass range by combining datasets , the small mass end of the distribution",
    "is ultimately determined by the finite grid scale .",
    "going to higher resolution and a larger number of particles is the obvious solution to this problem , and indeed the highest resolution @xmath4 simulation spanned nearly two mass decades .",
    "however , such a simulation is very computationally expensive and this expense makes a large exploration of parameter space infeasible .    in a similar vein , at any given resolution",
    ", we do not resolve compact planetesimals ; i.e. , the planetesimals that do form are large compared to the size of planetesimals that would form if we resolved particle self - gravity below the grid scale .",
    "these unphysical sizes can cause enhanced accretion of smaller solids onto formed planetesimals and make the power law distributions shallower . the future implementation of sink particles or sub - grid - cell gravity will help to alleviate these issues .    despite these uncertainties ,",
    "our first principles calculations provide additional evidence that the streaming instability can form planetesimals with properties consistent with solar system constraints .",
    "the largest remaining source of uncertainty may be in the initial metallicity and particle size distribution ( i.e. , _ prior _ to the onset of the streaming instabilty ) .",
    "if the appropriate initial conditions can be pinned down via astronomical observations , more comprehensive numerical simulations should be able to provide a detailed understanding of the formation and evolution of the planetesimal population .",
    "we thank daniel r. wik for his handy knowledge of statistics and katherine kretke for many discussions on observational constraints of solar system planetesimal populations .",

    "<S> we study the formation of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks from the gravitational collapse of solid over - densities generated via the streaming instability . to carry out these studies , we implement and test a particle - mesh self - gravity module for the athena code that enables the simulation of aerodynamically coupled systems of gas and collisionless self - gravitating solid particles . upon employment of our algorithm to planetesimal formation simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ( when a direct comparison is possible ) the athena simulations yield predicted planetesimal properties that agree well with those found in prior work using different numerical techniques . in particular , the gravitational collapse of streaming - initiated clumps leads to an initial planetesimal mass function that is well - represented by a power - law , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , which equates to a differential size distribution @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find no significant trends with resolution from a convergence study of up to @xmath4 grid zones and @xmath5 particles . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the power - law slope appears indifferent to changes in the relative strength of self - gravity and tidal shear , and to the time when ( for reasons of numerical economy ) self - gravity is turned on , though the strength of these claims is limited by small number statistics . for a typically assumed radial distribution of minimum mass solar nebula solids ( assumed here to have dimensionless stopping time @xmath6 ) , our results support the hypothesis that bodies on the scale of large asteroids or kuiper belt objects could have formed as the high - mass tail of a primordial planetesimal population </S>"
