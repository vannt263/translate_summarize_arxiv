    "one of the key open questions is a formulation of a quantum dynamics for causal sets . as a preliminary step towards such a formulation",
    ", one can define a _",
    "classical _ stochastic dynamics for causal sets in terms of a sequential growth process in discrete stages , each of which involves the addition of a new element to a causal set obtained from the previous stage . in this context",
    ", the dynamical law is an assignation of probabilities to each such transition from every finite causal set to its possible ` children ' in accordance with certain physical principles inspired by the continuum notions of general covariance and causality @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds the most general solution for the transition probabilities subject to these principles _ and _ the additional assumption that none of the transition probabilities vanish .",
    "thus the solution is generic but not the most general one .    the causal sets which arise from the generic classical sequential growth models are reasonably well understood .",
    "for example , there is significant evidence indicating that they do not produce ` manifoldlike ' causal sets @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to know whether the picture changes significantly if we allow vanishing transition probabilities . the quantum theory of causal sets",
    "is expected to arise from a decoherence functional ( or quantum measure ) defined on sets of histories ( causal sets ) . in some appropriate limit ( say after coarse graining to achieve decoherence ) , one expects to get probabilities which obey a kolmogorov sum rule , and there is no reason to expect that none of these will vanish .",
    "thus it is important to know if there is any drastic effect which arises from the case of vanishing probabilities .    in this work",
    "we extend the considerations of ref .",
    "@xcite to the general case in which the transition probabilities are required merely to be non - negative rather than positive .",
    "we will see that the general dynamics which results can be regarded as a sequence of different copies of the generic dynamics described in ref .",
    "@xcite , each being a ` turtle ' in an infinite ( temporal ) tower of turtles .",
    "this has been investigated earlier by joohan lee @xcite . in our treatment",
    "we assume some familiarity with the terminology and proofs of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we extend the physical principles of discrete general covariance and bell causality to the case of vanishing transition probabilities in section ii .",
    "these principles , in conjunction with the markovian and internally temporal nature of the growth process @xcite , restrict the dynamical law in certain important ways .",
    "we derive these restrictions in section iii . in section",
    "iv we show that these restrictions taken together allow an explicit characterization of the most general classical dynamics describing a growth process consistent with the physical principles mentioned above .",
    "section v contains our conclusions , and a few useful lemmas are proved in the appendix .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , consider @xmath0 , the poset of all ( isomorphism equivalence classes of ) finite causal sets ( causets ) wherein if a causet can be formed by accreting a single element to a second causet , then the former ( the ` child ' ) follows the latter ( the ` parent ' ) in @xmath0 and the relation between the causets is a link ( a relation not implied by transitivity ) .",
    "a sequential growth process corresponds to a path ( i.e.  a series of transitions from one causet to another ) in @xmath1 , starting from the empty causet . recall that a link may correspond to more than one distinct transition ( the number of distinct transitions are the number of inequivalent embeddings of the parent as a partial stem of the child , where two embeddings are equivalent if related by an automorphism of the child ; a partial stem is a sub - causet which contains its own past ) .",
    "a _ dynamical law _ is defined to be an assignation of transition probabilities ( i.e.  real numbers in [ 0,1 ] ) to each such distinct transition for every link of @xmath1 .",
    "we shall require that the dynamical law be consistent with the principles of general covariance and bell causality as well as the markov sum rule defined below in sections a  c .",
    "as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics , by virtue of its formulation as a sequential growth process , automatically incorporates the property of internal temporality ( which simply means that no new element can be born to the past of an existing element of any parent ) .    as in ref .",

    "+ ( ii ) if @xmath3 is any path through @xmath1 which originates at the empty set and terminates at a causet @xmath4 , the product of transition probabilities along its links is the same as for any other path from the empty set to @xmath4 .    for any generally covariant dynamics",
    ", we shall refer to the product of transition probabilities along the links of a path connecting the empty set to a causet @xmath4 as the _ specific probability of formation _ of @xmath4 .",
    "defined in ref .",
    "the latter is obtained by multiplying the specific probability by the number of inequivalent natural labellings of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "note that even the total probability of formation lacks covariant meaning , in that it refers to the probability of forming a particular finite causet after a specific stage of the growth process .",
    "physically meaningful probabilities can be extracted from the sequential growth dynamics by the measure it assigns to cylinder sets of unlabeled causets , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    for any assignation of transition probabilities consistent with general covariance , we define a _ virtual _ causet as one whose _ specific probability of formation _ vanishes .",
    "thus any path from the empty set to a virtual causet contains at least one link with zero transition probability .",
    "all causets which are not virtual are called _",
    "real_. virtual causets ( and hence , their descendants ) are never formed in the growth process .",
    "this is the reason that our definitions of bell causality and the markov sum rule below pertain only to real parents .",
    "since only specific probabilities of formation are of interest , two dynamical laws which generate the same set of specific probabilities of formation will be referred to as _ equivalent_. we restrict our considerations in the remainder of this section to generally covariant dynamics .",
    "we impose the same requirement as in ref.@xcite , except that we demand it only of real parents .",

    "as mentioned above , bell causality is only defined for _ real _ parents .",
    "let @xmath4 be a real parent and @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two of its children .",
    "let @xmath7 be the union of the precursor sets for the two transitions .",
    "( recall that a precursor set is the past of the new element whose introduction forms the child causet @xmath5 or @xmath6 . )",
    "clearly there is a path in @xmath0 starting from the empty set , ending at @xmath4 and passing through @xmath7 . since @xmath4 is real",
    "so is @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite , bell causality was formulated as @xmath13 this equation was meant to capture the idea that events occurring in some part of a causet should be influenced only by the portion of the causal set lying to their past .",
    "equation ( [ bcrs ] ) is only sensible when all transition probabilities are non - vanishing as in ref .",
    "we seek a generalization of this equation to the case of vanishing transition probabilities ( i.e.  when one or more of the children in ( [ bcrs ] ) are virtual ) .",
    "let @xmath14 for some transition from a real parent @xmath4 to its child @xmath15 . then",
    "a natural condition inspired by the idea alluded to just after equation ( [ bcrs ] ) would be to forbid _ all _ transitions from real parents which involve the same ( isomorphism class of ) precursor set as in @xmath16 .",
    "since the transition from the empty set to the 1-chain has probability @xmath17 , it would follow from such a condition that no antichain to antichain transition could be virtual . as we shall see in 6(b ) of the proof of lemma 2 in section iii ,",
    "the general solution to such a dynamics is that of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the @xmath18 can be zero .    our aim is to provide as general a dynamical law as possible , following the spirit of the conditions imposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular",
    ", we would like to allow for the vanishing of any of the transition probabilities , including those of the antichain to antichain transitions .",
    "a natural set of conditions which allows this and serves as a reasonable generalization of equation ( [ bcrs ] ) may be arrived at by the following qualitative discussion .    the formulation of ( [ bcrs ] )",
    "may be thought to involve two distinct ingredients : + ( a ) the idea that there is a propensity for a transition to occur depending solely on the nature of the transition , i.e.  the precursor set involved .",
    "this is incorporated in ( [ bcrs ] ) by requiring that the transitions @xmath11 have the same precursor sets for each of @xmath12 .",
    "+ ( b ) the implication of the markov sum rule that the net probability of formation of all possible children from a real parent is fixed and equal to unity .",
    "this forces ( [ bcrs ] ) to be an equality of _ ratios _ of probabilities rather than probabilities themselves .    viewed in terms of ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", a transition probability could vanish due to two distinct reasons : ( 1 ) the transition is intrinsically forbidden so that all transitions involving the same precursor set are also virtual or ( 2 ) there are so many competing siblings that they `` take away the entire available probability '' and drive the transition probability for the transition in question to zero .",
    "the consequences of this viewpoint are as follows .",
    "consider , as before , the real causet @xmath4 and its ancestor @xmath7 .",
    "every precursor set in @xmath7 is also a precursor set in @xmath4 .",
    "hence for every birth in @xmath7 there is a birth in @xmath4 , but since @xmath4 is larger than @xmath7 , it has more children than @xmath7 . clearly ,",
    "if @xmath19 then @xmath5 must also be virtual since @xmath5 has even more competing siblings than @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath20 , then @xmath8 must also be real , since @xmath8 has even fewer siblings than @xmath5 .",
    "the relative propensity of the birth of @xmath6 with respect to that of @xmath5 is then well defined as the ratio of the two transition probabilities , and may be taken to quantify the relative propensity of the birth @xmath9 with respect to that of @xmath8 . in the case",
    "that both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are virtual , the relative propensity of their births is ill defined .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath21 may be because @xmath5 and @xmath6 have too many competing siblings .",
    "the corresponding children @xmath22 of @xmath7 have fewer competing siblings and hence it is possible that either or both these children are real .    as a result of this qualitative discussion",
    ", we formulate the bell causality condition in terms of @xmath23 ( which have been defined just before equation ( [ bcrs ] ) ) as follows :    \\(i ) if all four transition probabilities are non - vanishing , bell causality is defined by ( [ bcrs ] ) .",

    "note that if the transition probabilities vanished only because the transition in question was intrinsically forbidden , we would obtain that @xmath31 iff @xmath32 which would in turn imply ( i)(iii ) above and a _ stronger _ condition than ( iv ) .",
    "in the remainder of this work we use ( i)(iv ) as our definition of bell causality .",
    "in addition we freely make use of the fact that the bell causality conditions ( i)(iv ) hold when @xmath7 is replaced by any subcauset of @xmath4 which contains the union of the precursors of the two transitions as a partial stem .",
