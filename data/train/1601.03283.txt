    "over the past decade we have seen a remarkable phenomenological success of describing heavy - ion collisions using relativistic hydrodynamics . in the modern theoretical view",
    ", hydrodynamics is seen as a low energy effective theory of the underlying quantum - field theory , and as such it is relying on an assumption that the energy - momentum tensor can expanded around its thermal equilibrium value @xmath0 in terms of gradients of flow fields , @xmath1 where the terms in the series are graded by the number of derivatives acting on the flow fields @xmath2 @xcite . if the flow fields are sufficiently smooth , the flow is well described in terms of the few first terms in the series , but when the gradients are large , the system is no longer described in terms of hydrodynamics .    due to the singular geometry of an ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision ,",
    "the gradients of the flow fields diverge when approaching @xmath3 , the moment when the two lorentz contracted nuclei first collided .",
    "therefore it is clear that the full time evolution of the collision is not amendable for hydrodynamical description and any hydrodynamical simulation has to start at some _ initialization time _",
    "@xmath4 after the collision , when the hydrodynamical description has become appropriate .",
    "the dynamics before this time are _ prethermal _ dynamics .",
    "the minimal requirement on the prethermal model is that it smoothly and automatically approaches hydrodynamical flow .",
    "if this is the case , then the physical results become independent of the unphysical choice of initialization time .",
    "this , however , is not the case in the vast majority of current implementations where the prethermal evolution is either completely neglected , or modelled in a way that does not contain the correct physics to reach hydrodynamical flow .",
    "the residual dependence promotes the unphysical initialization time to a physical model parameter often referred as the _ thermalization time _ which needs to be fixed by comparison to data .",
    "the problem is not only phenomenological . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the failure to reach correct behaviour is a sign of failure to identify the correct dominant physics .     a cartoon of the path from color - glass - condensate initial condition to the thermal equilibrium in a plane of occupancy and anisotropy .",
    "at proper time @xmath5 , the system is parametrically overoccupied .",
    "initially , the interactions are not strong enough to counter the expansion , and the system becomes more anisotropic and dilute .",
    "once the modes become underoccupied the dominant physics change qualitatively and the system does not become anymore anisotropic . eventually the underoccupied system reaches equilibrium through the process of radiative break - up that causes the trajectory eventually turn towards the origin in the figure .",
    "the system is described by classical field theory in the overoccupied region , and by effective kinetic theory both in the underoccupied and overoccupied side , except when occupancies are non - perturbatively large @xmath6 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    there have been two quite different strategies to attempt to quantitatively understand the prethermal evolution .",
    "on one hand , with holographic methods , it has become possible to follow the far - from - equilibrium evolution of certain gauge theories ( @xmath7 sym in the @xmath8 limit ) and observe the onset of hydrodynamical flow in collisions of sheets or lumps of supersymmetric matter @xcite .",
    "this has made it possible to construct a model that explicitly exhibits insensitivity to initialization time @xcite .",
    "the holographic method is , however , critically limited to a very special set of theories and can not be applied to qcd .",
    "the complementary strategy has been to study the prethermal evolution in qcd in the weak coupling limit ( corresponding to the limit of @xmath9 ) , where in principle we expect to have analytical control of the theory . in this limit",
    ", the initial condition for the prethermal evolution is fairly well understood in terms of the physics of saturation and the color - glass - condensate framework @xcite .",
    "there have been several weak coupling motivated or inspired models used for phenomenology , but none of these have so far quantitatively included all the necessary physics for a leading order calculation .",
    "however , in the recent past there has been significant progress , that will be reviewed in these proceedings .    at weak coupling",
    "the smallness of coupling provides us with large scale separations .",
    "while the task of following the time evolution of a full quantum field theory is an unsolved problem , these scale separations make it possible to study the prethermal evolution within different effective theories , in particular using classical field theory and effective kinetic theory .",
    "but while the scale separations make it possible to follow the time evolution of the system , they also make the prethermal evolution go through several stages of very different physics , all of which must be quantitatively understood for a full leading order description of the prethermal evolution .",
    "this proceeding is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : route ] i describe the overall features of the thermalization process and what are the roles of classical field theory and effective kinetic theory in its description . in the following sections [ sec : clas ] and [ sec : kin ]",
    "i discuss briefly recent simulations in classical yang - mills theory and in effective kinetic theory .",
    "i conclude with a discussion about the relevance of weak coupling thermalization to future phenomenology .",

    "the occupancies are non - perturbative @xmath6 the system is described in classical ym theory .",
    "the cym evolution however makes the system ever more dilute and anisotropic never approaching local thermal equilibrium and hydrodynamic description .",
    "when the occupancies are @xmath10 both cym and ekt give equally good leading order description and the system can be smoothly passed from classical fields to particles at arbitrary time @xmath11 .",
    "the subsequent evolution in ekt will then deviate from the classical field evolution once the occupancies become close to unity @xmath12 and smoothly and automatically asymptote to hydrodynamical evolution .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    according to the picture arising from the saturation framework and cgc , the post - collisional debris that are left in the midrapidity region , and that will eventually form the hydrodynamically expanding medium , consist of parametrically overoccupied gluon fields at a typical saturation scale @xmath13 @xcite.that is , the typical mode occupancies per unit phase phase space volume for gluons are inversely proportional to the coupling constant @xmath14 at the dominant momentum scale @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , a system that is in thermal equilibrium has phase space occupancies of the order of unity @xmath12 at the scale given by the temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the challenge to understand the process of thermalization at weak coupling is then to understand how this overoccupied far - from - equilibrium state reaches the thermal state under the violently expanding geometry of the heavy - ion collision .",
    "the route the weakly coupled system takes to reach local thermal equilibrium is not straightforward .",
    "indeed , it was first realized by ref",
    ".  @xcite that under longitudinal expansion a system that is initially overoccupied becomes underoccupied before it reaches thermal equilibrium .",
    "this behaviour is depicted in cartoon of fig .",
    "[ fig : route ] on a plane of occupancy and anisotropy .",
    "the interactions work to bring the system directly from the overoccupied initial condition to the thermal equilibrium at the origin of the figure . indeed , in the absence of expansion , the thermalization would proceed along a straightforward route with monotonically decreasing occupancies directly to thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the effect of the expansion , however , makes the system more anisotropic .",
    "the combined effect of the two leads the system to miss the thermal equilibrium at the origin , and causes the system to flow to the underoccupied half of the diagram .",
    "this behaviour is examined in detail in refs .",
    "once the system turns underoccupied , its physics changes qualitatively ( in particular for inelastic scattering which changes from merging to splitting ) , and this change eventually allows the system to reach the thermal equilibrium .",
    "that the system explores both the underoccupied and overoccupied regions of the diagram before settling to thermal equilibrium has a technical implication that the degrees of freedom that are used to describe the system also change during the the prethermal evolution . on one hand , as long as the system is overoccupied , it can be described in terms of classical yang - mills ( cym ) theory .",
    "the corrections to classical field theory description comes from non - zero coupling @xmath16 and from small occupancies @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "when the occupancies become less large , the `` quantum corrections '' arising from the expansion in the inverse occupancy become large , and the when @xmath18 , the classical theory fails to give a faithful description of the system .",
    "therefore the classical description can never reach the thermal equilibrium with @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , once the system becomes underoccupied , it is better described in terms of particle degrees of freedoms and their kinetic theory .",
    "the expansion parameters of the kinetic theory description are again the coupling constant itself , @xmath16 , but also the occupancies @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the effective kinetic theory can be used to describe systems that are underoccupied , and the description can be extended to occupancies that are large but not non - perturbatively large @xmath20 , so that it can reach the thermal equilibrium but not the cgc initial condition .",

    "however , a strategy where the early evolution is described by classical yang - mills theory and where the late approach to hydrodynamics is dealt within kinetic theory , can indeed bring the overoccupied initial condition to thermal equilibrium .",
    "in such strategy , the system must be passed from one set of degrees of freedom ( the classical ym fields ) to another ( distribution functions of kinetic theory ) .",

    "the thermalization times , obtained from the weak coupling framework extrapolated to intermediate couplings show agreement with the phenomenological expectation of @xmath461fm / c .",

    "the current implementation of the ekt does not allow for transverse dynamics , which is a crucial for the preflow , and the numerical role of certain plasma unstable modes is still somewhat unclear .",

    ", while there are still several caveats , the list is getting shorter and the field of weak coupling thermalization is becoming a quantitative field .",
    "how much of this theoretical exercise performed at the weak coupling limit carries through to physical heavy - ion collisions that are performed at rhic or at the lhc , which unfortunately do not run at the asymptotic limit @xmath9 ?",
    "are we allowed to extrapolate the weak coupling results to the relevant interesting intermediate couplings around @xmath47 ?",
    "a pessimist view would be to note that perturbation theory at finite temperature is notoriously badly convergent at temperatures close to @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "however , an optimist would notice that as the thermalization takes place rather fast , the resulting temperatures at @xmath11 are still of order @xmath49 .",
    "this does lie in the temperature range where the perturbation theory in its modern incarnations seems to describe lattice results .",
    "the hydrodynamical evolution will eventually cool the system to a temperature range where a weak coupling description of the medium most likely is inappropriate , but by then the system has been already passed to a hydrodynamical description . as the hydrodynamical analysis mostly constrain the minimum of @xmath50 around @xmath48 @xcite , not its value around @xmath51 , this picture is not in contrast with the phenomenology and the paradigm of small @xmath50 .",
    "so far the strategy has been to extrapolate the weak coupling results to intermediate couplings expected to realize in physical collisions .",
    "the same goes for the strong coupling studies where the results obtained at infinite coupling are again extrapolated down to intermediate couplings . however , perhaps a better strategy than extrapolating would be to use all available information to constrain the intermediate couplings ; to interpolate rather than extrapolate .",
    "first steps in this direction are taken in @xcite , where non - equilibrium evolutions of strongly and weakly coupled theories with similar initial conditions are compared .    whether the strategy is to extrapolate or to interpolate in coupling ,",
    "it is clear that it is of importance to push the calculations beyond the leading order accuracy , both at weak and at strong coupling in order to increase precision of the results and to better evaluate at what range of couplings they provide useful constraints . while it will be a long way to nlo",
