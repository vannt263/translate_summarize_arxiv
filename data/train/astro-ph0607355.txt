    "the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) is a collaborative effort to obtain both deep imaging covering all major wavebands from x - ray to radio and optical spectroscopy over a large area of sky ( 0.51deg@xmath3 ) with the aim of studying the panchromatic properties of galaxies over the last half of the hubble time .",
    "the region studied , the extended groth strip ( egs : @xmath4=14@xmath517@xmath6 , @xmath7=+52@xmath830@xmath9 ) is an extension of and owes its name to a _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) survey consisting of 28 wide - field planetary camera2 ( wfpc2 ) pointings carried out in 1994 by the wfpc team @xcite .",
    "this field benefits from low extinction , low galactic and zodiacal infrared emission , and good schedulability by space - based observatories , and has therefore attracted a wide range of deep observations at essentially every accessible wavelength over this comparatively wide field .    amongst deep multiwavelength fields ,",
    "the egs field provides a unique combination of area and depth at almost every waveband observable .",
    "it is two ( for _ hst _ ) to four ( for _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ ) times larger than the combined goods fields @xcite , yet has a similar range of wavelength coverage , making it ideal for studying rare classes of objects that may be absent in smaller fields .",
    "the gems field @xcite covers a similar area to similar depths , but was studied by the combo-17 photometric redshift survey rather than a spectroscopic survey .",
    "most aegis data sets cover @xmath10.51deg@xmath3 , considerably smaller than the 2deg@xmath3 cosmos field @xcite . however , aegis observations are deeper at most wavelengths , benefiting from greater schedulability and lower backgrounds .",
    "spectroscopy of the cosmos field is in progress @xcite , but will not be completed for 35  years .",
    "an additional advantage of aegis is that deep _",
    "imaging is available in two bands ( f606w and f814w ) , whereas the cosmos field has been observed in f814w only , while the f850lp imaging in gems is too shallow to study subcomponent colors for most galaxies .    even before aegis",
    ", the egs region attracted a rich suite of surveys , including both spectroscopy @xcite and panchromatic imaging from both the ground and space , running from x - ray @xcite to ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical @xcite , near infrared ( ir ) @xcite , mid - ir @xcite , submillimeter @xcite , and radio @xcite .",
    "aegis has carried this work even further ; for example , the first generation of the deep galaxy redshift survey , deep1 , obtained 620  galaxy redshifts in the wfpc2 groth strip region , now publicly available @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the successor deep2 galaxy redshift survey has obtained 9501  redshifts in the egs so far , with thousands more planned .",
    "data from deep2 are a linchpin for almost all aegis studies , providing redshifts ; internal kinematics for dynamical masses ; line strengths for star formation rates , agn identification , and gas - phase metallicities ; stellar population ages and metallicites ; etc .. the precision and relatively dense sampling of deep2 redshifts allow for accurate measurement of the local environment of objects in egs , which is a major factor driving galaxy evolution .",
    "other surveys at similar redshifts provide weaker environmental measures due to larger redshift errors , lower sampling rates , and/or smaller areas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can remove cosmic variance fluctuations from observed aegis abundances by comparing redshift distributions to the other three , widely - separated deep2 fields .",
    "ten instrument teams and a number of theorists are now collaborating on aegis  nearly 100  scientists in half a dozen countries .",
    "the first fruits of this collaboration are presented in this issue of _ astrophysical journal letters_. these papers make use of the power of the combined aegis dataset in a variety of ways .",
    "six _ letters _ investigate the nature of rare objects found in the aegis field , illustrating the benefits of covering an area wide enough to find them in @xcite .",
    "these studies take advantage of the full multiwavelength coverage from aegis , which provides each object s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in detail ; we also explore the range of seds exhibited by a wider set of galaxies in @xcite .",
    "five more _ letters _ investigate the drivers and evolution of star formation in galaxies using the wide array of indicators available from this multifaceted dataset , based on uv , ir , and radio continuum as well as optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "three _ letters _ focus on the optical properties of active galactic nuclei at @xmath0@xmath11.4 identified using both deep x - ray and ir data , and explore their relationship to their large - scale structure environment @xcite .",
    "two _ letters _ test for evolution in the relationships between mass measures to @xmath0@xmath11 : between stellar mass and gas kinematics within individual galaxies @xcite , and between x - ray gas emission and galaxy kinematics in groups of galaxies @xcite . the remaining two _",
    "letters _ use deep2 spectroscopy to investigate the nature of objects which are extremely red in optical - ir color , finding that a substantial fraction of the population lies at @xmath0@xmath101.4 @xcite .",
    "these papers present only the first results from the aegis survey ; we are just beginning to reach the potential of this manyfaceted dataset .",
    "this _ letter _ gives details on the aegis data which have been obtained so far ; we only describe those survey data sets in the egs field which are used in this special issue here .",
    "large portions of this dataset , including the deep2 spectra and _ hst_/acs imaging , will be publicly released in 2007 , making it a legacy for the entire community .",
    "the basic parameters of the aegis multiwavelength data sets are listed in table[tab : data_tbl ] and their sky coverage is shown in figure[fig : skymap ] . the acquisition and reduction of the aegis data sets and the derivation of source photometry catalogs",
    "[ from which panchromatic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are measured ] are described in detail below . _",
