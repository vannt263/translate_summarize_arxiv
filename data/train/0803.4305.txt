    "highly charged ions are often considered as the ideal testing ground for investigating the strong - field regime of bound - state quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "they feature a strong static coulomb field of the nucleus and have a simple electronic structure , which can be accurately determined in _ ab initio _ theoretical calculations . in this respect ,",
    "the ultimate investigation object is the h - like uranium , the heaviest naturally occurring element .",
    "measurements of the @xmath5 lamb shift in h - like uranium have progressed drastically during last decades @xcite , having achieved an accuracy of 4.6  ev @xcite , which corresponds to a fractional error of 1.7% with respect to the total qed contribution .",

    "even higher precision is achieved for heavy li - like ions .",
    "measurements of the @xmath6-@xmath7 transition energies @xcite have lately reached a fractional accuracy of 0.03% with respect to the total qed contribution .",
    "this corresponds to a 10% sensitivity of the experimental results to the two - loop qed effects .",
    "these measurements provide an excellent possibility for the identification of the two - loop lamb shift and for testing the bound - state qed up to second order in @xmath8 in the strong - field regime ( @xmath8 is the fine - structure constant )",
    ". theoretical description of li - like ions is more complicated than that of h - like ions , which is due to the presence of additional electrons . for heavy systems ,",
    "the electron - electron interaction is weak ( as compared to the electron - nucleus interaction ) and can be successfully treated by perturbation theory . _",
    "ab initio _ calculational results for the effects of the electron correlation and the screening of one - loop qed corrections are already available for li - like ions @xcite ; their accuracy is sufficient for identification of the two - loop qed effects .",
    "the detailed theoretical understanding of the two - loop qed effects is also necessary for the interpretation of high - precision experimental data in the low-@xmath9 region .",
    "the most prominent example here is hydrogen .",
    "its spectroscopy can nowadays be realized with a relative accuracy on the level of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the @xmath5 and @xmath7 lamb shift in hydrogen is still limited , to a large extent , by the two - loop qed effects @xcite .",
    "the subject of our present interest is the set of the two - loop qed corrections ( also referred to as the two - loop lamb shift ) , graphically represented in fig .",

    "these corrections have been intensively investigated within the perturbative expansion in the binding - strength parameter @xmath3 @xcite ( @xmath9 is the nuclear charge number ) .",
    "the results of these studies , however , do not provide reliable information about the magnitude of the two - loop lamb shift in heavy ions , where the parameter @xmath3 approaches unity . a non - perturbative ( in @xmath3 ) evaluation of the whole set of the two - loop diagrams",

    "this will allow us to make a detailed comparison with the perturbative calculations and to isolate the non - perturbative remainder to order @xmath4 , which is of experimental interest for hydrogen .",
    "our calculation will be performed to all orders in the binding - strength parameter @xmath3 , but an approximation will be made in the treatment of the fermion loops in the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:2order](h)-(k ) .",
    "this approximation , referred to as the _ free - loop _",
    "one , consists in keeping the leading nonvanishing term of the expansion of the fermion loop in terms of the binding potential . in the one - loop case",
    ", it corresponds to the uehling potential and yields the dominant contribution even for high-@xmath9 ions . to perform a non - perturbative calculation of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:2order](h)-(k ) without the free - loop approximation is a difficult and a so far unsolved problem .",

    "we start with presenting some basic formulas for the first - order self - energy and vacuum - polarization corrections that will be needed below in addressing the two - loop corrections .",

    "it is assumed that the above expressions are regularized in a covariant way and that the limit that removes the regularization is properly approached .    in order to facilitate the numerical evaluation of the above expressions",

    "a popular method of doing this @xcite is based on the expansion of the se operator in terms the binding field , @xmath27 where the superscript @xmath28 , @xmath29 indicates the total number of interactions with the binding coulomb field and the index @xmath30 labels the term generated by @xmath31 such interactions .",

    "several modifications were introduced into the scheme , among them the inclusion of the finite nuclear size effect .",
    "this modification was essential , firstly , because the effect is significantly enhanced by the singular behavior of the vp potential and , secondly , because the extended nuclear charge distribution removes the logarithmic singularity of the point - nucleus uehling potential , which simplifies numerical integrations considerably .",

    "still , the project of the calculation of the two - loop lamb shift is far from being finished .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , the results of the all - order calculation of the two - loop self - energy correction for the @xmath5 state in the low-@xmath9 region @xcite do not agree well with the @xmath3-expansion result of ref .",
    "second , the calculation @xcite for the @xmath1 states was performed in the high-@xmath9 region only .",
    "third , a part of the two - loop diagrams with closed fermion loops is presently calculated within the free - loop approximation only .",
    "each of these points represents a difficult problem and all of them should be solved before the calculation of the lamb shift to order @xmath214 is completed .",
