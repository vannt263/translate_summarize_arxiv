    "it is also shown that a classical two coupled oscillators model  @xcite with a lossy dark oscillator provides the same general formula when the complex amplitude of the bright oscillator is expanded near the dark resonance  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even without resorting to a plasmonic dark mode , a far - field fano - like asymmetric line shape is observed in plasmonic structures .",
    "the occurrence of a fano - like interference in a single nano - rod plasmonic structures is attributed to a spatial overlap of two non - orthogonal adjacent plasmonic modes  @xcite . and in a nonconcentric ring / disk cavity plasmonic structure",
    ", fano line shape still persists when dark multipolar resonances are optically excited by a retardation effect at a non - normal incidence angle  @xcite . in a heptamer plasmonic nanostructure composed of one center disc with surrounding hexamer ring ,",
    "an examination of local density of optical states by a selective e - beam excitation of center and ring showed that a far - field interference between the dressed superradiant and subradiant eigenmodes fully describes fano resonance  @xcite .",
    "in fact , asymmetric fano line shapes observed in a variety of plasmonic structures are fitted to the general fano formula with an excellent agreement  @xcite .",
    "these studies lead to the notion that in plasmonic structures an interference between superradiant and subradient eigenmodes overlapping both spectrally and spatially gives rise to an asymmetric fano line shape resonance  @xcite .",
    "now we raise the question whether asymmetric fano line shape is retained even when both superradiant and subradiant oscillators are driven simultaneously in the presence of a coherent coupling .",
    "we examine how the broad lorentzian spectrum of a superradiant oscillator is modified when coupled with a driven subradiant narrow oscillator by adopting a simple mechanical two coupled oscillators model .",
    "two coupled oscillators are described by a set of equations of motion .",
    "@xmath113 narrow spectrum of the subradiant oscillator @xmath25 is located within broad spectrum of the superradiant oscillator @xmath112 .",
    "putting @xmath114 , we obtain the amplitude @xmath115 of the superradiant oscillator @xmath112 near resonance @xmath116 of narrow subradiant oscillator @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "@xcite is kept the same as a closed form with a modification in the asymmetry parameter from @xmath9 to @xmath123 .",
    "we observe that a dark mode is not necessarily prerequisite for an asymmetric fano resonance to take place in plasmonic structures .",
    "the dark mode is simply an example of non - driven narrow resonance .",
    "the characteristic asymmetry feature of fano resonance in plasmonic structures is retained even in the presence of an external driving of narrow oscillator as far as a dispersive coherent coupling between two oscillators ensures a @xmath93-phase shift in the broad superradiant oscillator near the narrow subradiant oscillator resonance ."
