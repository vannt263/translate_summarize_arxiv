    "f.  bessmertny @xcite , which appeared in russian about twenty years ago and until very recent time was unknown to western readers ( the translations of some its parts into english are appearing now : see @xcite ) , rational @xmath0 matrix - valued functions representable in the form @xmath1 with a linear @xmath2 matrix - valued function @xmath3\\ ] ] were considered .",
    "another form of such a representation is @xmath4a(z)^{-1 }        \\left[\\begin{array}{c }          i_{n\\times n }",
    "\\\\         0_{p\\times n}\\end{array}\\right]\\right)^{-1},\\ ] ] and both ( [ eq : sc ] ) and ( [ eq : lr ] ) were called by bessmertny a _ long resolvent representation_. it is easy to see that this is nothing but the _ schur complement _ of the block @xmath5 in the linear matrix pencil @xmath6 . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) bessmertny constructed a long resolvent representation for an arbitrary rational matrix function , and in the homogeneous case , i.e. , when @xmath7 one has @xmath8 .    a particular role in his thesis",
    "is played by functions of the form ( [ eq : sc ] ) or ( [ eq : lr ] ) with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( matrices @xmath10 are assumed to have real entries ) , due to their relation to electrical circuits .",
    "he proved that such functions constitute the class ( let us denote it by @xmath11 ) of characteristic matrix functions of passive 2n - poles , where impedances of elements ( resistances , capacitances , inductances and ideal transformers are allowed ) are considered as independent variables ( let us note , that in the analytic theory of electrical circuits it is customary to consider characteristic matrices as functions of frequency , e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that any @xmath12 satisfies the following properties : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the _ open right polyhalfplane _ , i.e. , the cartesian product of @xmath15 copies of the open right half - plane @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , together with property ( [ eq : hom ] ) .",
    "denote by @xmath19 the class of rational _ homogeneous positive real _ @xmath0 matrix functions , i.e. , rational functions taking @xmath0 matrix values and satisfying conditions ( [ eq : hom])([eq : real ] ) .",
    "then @xmath20 . let us remark that replacement of the requirement @xmath21 by @xmath22 ( i.e. , removing the assumption that positive semidefinite matrices @xmath10 have only real entries ) , in the definition of @xmath11 , and removing the second equality in condition ( [ eq : real ] ) in the definition of @xmath19 define the classes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear that in the case @xmath26 one has @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is an @xmath0 matrix with real ( resp .",
    ", complex ) entries , thus this case is trivial .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in the case @xmath31 one has @xmath32 , too ( and we shall prove in the present paper that @xmath33 ) . for @xmath34 the question whether the inclusion @xmath20 ( as well as @xmath35 ) is proper , is still open .",
    "bessmertny constructed the long resolvent representations for the following special cases of functions from @xmath19 :    * any @xmath36 ; * any rational scalar function @xmath37 with co - prime polynomials @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( see @xcite , and also @xcite ) ; * any so - called _ primary _ rational matrix function @xmath41 , i.e. , such that the matrix - valued polynomial @xmath38 and the scalar polynomial @xmath39 are co - prime and of degree at most one with respect to each variable , and for each @xmath42 there exist scalar polynomials @xmath43 such that @xmath44\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc }        \\psi_1^{(j)}(z ) & \\ldots & \\psi_n^{(j)}(z )      \\end{array}\\right ] ;      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it was shown that @xmath45 is primary if and only if there exists its long resolvent representation where coefficients @xmath46 , of @xmath6 in ( [ eq : lp ] ) are positive semidefinite ( psd ) @xmath2 matrices of rank one with real entries , and @xmath8 ( see @xcite , and also @xcite ) .",
    "however , no any inner characterization of the class @xmath11 appears in @xcite , i.e. , bessmertnyi s thesis does nt give an idea how to distinguish functions from @xmath19 which admit a long resolvent representation , except the cases mentioned above and those functions which arise as characteristic functions of certain concrete passive electrical 2n - poles .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to give such a characterization .",
    "we succeed , however in a more general framework , which is quite natural .",
    "firstly , we consider operator - valued functions instead of only matrix - valued ones . secondly , we consider holomorphic functions instead of only rational ones .",
    "thirdly , we permit infinite - dimensional long resolvent representations instead of only finite - dimensional ones .",
    "we start with the  complex case \" , i.e. , generalize the classes @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in section  [ sec : classes ] we introduce the corresponding classes @xmath47 and @xmath48 of homogeneous positive holomorphic @xmath49-valued functions ( throughout this paper @xmath50 denotes the banach space of bounded linear operators mapping a hilbert space @xmath51 into a hilbert space @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ; all hilbert spaces are supposed to be complex ) .",
    "we obtain the characterization of functions from the class @xmath47 ( which we call the _ bessmertny class _ ) via a couple of identities which involve certain psd kernels . in section  [ sec : b - calc ] we show that one of these identities turns under the cayley transform over the variables into the agler identity for holomorphic functions on the _ unit polydisk _",
    "latexmath:[$\\mathbb{d}^n:=\\ { z\\in\\mathbb{c}^n:\\    the latter means that the image of the @xmath47 under the cayley transform over the variables is a subclass in the agler ",
    "herglotz class @xmath55 , introduced in @xcite . using the characterization of @xmath55 in terms of functional calculus of @xmath15-tuples of commuting strictly contractive linear operators on a hilbert space , we obtain the characterization of @xmath47 in terms of functional calculus of @xmath15-tuples of commuting bounded strictly accretive operators on a hilbert space . in section  [ sec : ag ] we characterize the image of the bessmertny class @xmath47 under the double cayley transform (  double \" means that this linear - fractional transform is applied to the variables and to the operator values , simultaneously ) , as a subclass in the agler ",
    "schur class @xmath56 , also introduced in @xcite .",
    "this characterization turns out to be pretty surprising : a function belongs to this subclass if and only if it is representable as a transfer function of an agler unitary colligation for which the colligation operator is not only unitary , but also selfadjoint . in section  [ sec : dehom ]",
    "we establish a natural one - to - one correspondence between @xmath47 ( which consists of homogeneous functions of @xmath15 variables ) and certain class of ( generically ) non - homogeneous functions of @xmath57 variables .",
    "however , a special complicated structure of the latter class does rather convince us that @xmath47 is more likeable to deal with . in section  [ sec : real ] we turn to the  real \" case .",
    "we introduce the notions of @xmath58-real operator and @xmath58-real operator - valued function for an anti - unitary involution @xmath59 on a hilbert space @xmath51 which plays a role analogous to the complex conjugation in @xmath60 , and then introduce the subclasses @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the classes @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , consisting of @xmath58-real operator - valued functions .",
    "these subclasses generalize the classes @xmath11 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we adapt the results for the  complex case \" of the preceding sections to this  real case \" , i.e. , give the characterizations of @xmath61 in terms of long resolvent representations , in terms of identities involving psd kernels , in terms of agler s unitary colligations and their transfer function representations for images of its elements under the double cayley transform .",
    "in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize the results obtained in this paper , and also formulate and briefly discuss the most important open problems arising in connection with our investigation .",

    "we have obtained several equivalent characterizations of the class @xmath47 , which we call the bessmertny class , scattered in different parts of this paper , and for convenience of a reader we collect them now in the following theorem .",
    "( i ) : :    there exist a hilbert space @xmath183 and a    representation    @xmath682 of    @xmath45 , where    @xmath683\\in l(\\mathcal{u}\\oplus\\mathcal{h}),\\ ] ] with    @xmath684 ; ( ii ) : :    there exists a representation    @xmath685 of @xmath45 , where    @xmath209 , are holomorphic psd    kernels on @xmath210 ; ( iii ) : :    @xmath45 satisfies the conditions :    +    1 .   @xmath686 ;    2 .   @xmath687 +    ( the set @xmath284 of @xmath15-tuples of    commuting strictly accretive operators on a hilbert space , and the    functional calculus for @xmath688 are defined in    section  [ sec : b - calc ] ) ;    3 .   @xmath331 ; ( iv ) : :    there exist hilbert spaces    @xmath689 , such    that @xmath343 , and an    agler representation    @xmath690 of    a double cayley transform @xmath334 of    @xmath45 ( which is defined by ( [ eq : cayley - val ] ) ) , where    @xmath691 , and    @xmath692=u = u^{-1}=u^*\\in         l(\\mathcal{x}\\oplus\\mathcal{u}).\\ ] ]      we have introduced also the class @xmath61 consisting of all @xmath58-real functions from @xmath47 , for an anti - unitary involution @xmath528 on @xmath51 .",

    "@xmath62 , @xmath696 , @xmath700 ) .      for the classes @xmath47 and @xmath703 , this problem , can be reformulated as follows : find @xmath458 and @xmath291 such that the selfadjoint operator @xmath704 is not psd .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the inequality @xmath705 , where @xmath334 is a holomorphic contractive @xmath49-valued function on @xmath268 , and the @xmath15-tuple of operators @xmath706 is defined by @xmath707 , i.e. for @xmath336 and @xmath708 the _",
