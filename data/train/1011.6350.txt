    "it is well known that magnetic fields play a very important role in high - energy astrophysical phenomena such as particle acceleration and synchrotron emission .",
    "strong magnetic fields are often required around shock waves to explain the observed emissions .",
    "for example , at the shocks in supernova remnants ( snrs ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , magnetic field strengths with orders of magnitude larger than their ambient fields are needed , and these can not be achieved by only shock compression ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , some amplification mechanisms have been proposed such as the weibel instability @xcite , the cosmic - ray streaming instability @xcite , and the ( small - scale ) dynamo effect @xcite due to the turbulence induced by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instabilities @xcite .",
    "each mechanism has its own advantage .",
    "the weibel instability can create magnetic fields even from unmagnetized media , and the cosmic - ray streaming instability can amplify upstream magnetic fields that are essential in first - order fermi - acceleration processes in the shock wave . because the dynamo effect works under the influence of macroscopic hydrodynamic instabilities , it can generate larger scale magnetic field fluctuations than those induced by the microscopic plasma instabilities , which may be essentially important for synchrotron radiation and scattering high - energy particles . using three - dimensional relativistic mhd simulations",
    ", @xcite showed that the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) induced by relativistic shear flows activates turbulence dynamos .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the turbulent - dynamo effect with three - dimensional relativistic mhd simulations by taking grbs as an example .",
    "we study the effects of the richtmyer - meshkov instability ( rmi ) , which are induced when the preshock density is inhomogeneous ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews of rmi ) .",
    "the rmi is a rayleigh - taylor - type instability that deforms the shock front and leaves vorticity behind the shock waves . for the rayleigh - taylor instability , deformation of a discontinuity",
    "is triggered by gravitational acceleration , while the rmi is triggered by an impulsive acceleration caused by the passage of shock .    because grbs are believed to be associated with relativistic shocks of intermittent and inhomogeneous outflows @xcite",
    ", we can reasonably expect the work of rmi . in the framework of newtonian fluid dynamics",
    ", it was shown using mhd simulations in the context of snrs that the preshock density inhomogeneity cause the magnetic field amplification @xcite . in a relativistic shock wave ,",
    "the idea was examined analytically by @xcite , who considered how vorticity is generated because of the interaction between an ultra - relativistic shock and a density bump .",
    "recently , using two - dimensional special relativistic mhd simulations , @xcite showed that the magnetic field can be amplified in the postshock of an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "however , it is known that turbulence in two dimensions usually leads to very intermittent structures of velocity and magnetic fields compared to the three - dimensional case due to inverse cascade of enstrophy @xcite that may induce `` fake '' magnetic field amplifications . thus , the evolution of turbulence and resulting magnetic field amplification should be verified by three - dimensional simulations , although the result of @xcite is suggestive .    in this paper , using three - dimensional special relativistic simulations , we examine the following items : ( i ) the generation of turbulence at the relativistic shock front through the rmi and the resulting magnetic field amplification caused by turbulence and ( ii ) the decay of relativistic mhd turbulence based on the results of ( i ) .",
    "because it is computationally very expensive to follow the long - term evolution of turbulence in the former simulations , we can not obtain the saturation level or decay rate of the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "the supplementary simulations of ( ii ) allow us to study the decaying phase of turbulence as a consequence of its long - term evolution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : setup ] we provide numerical techniques and setups .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations are presented in  [ sec : rmi ] ( generation of turbulence and growth of magnetic field ) and  [ sec : decay ] ( long - term evolution and turbulence decay ) . in ",
    "[ sec : sum ] , we summarize our findings from the simulations . finally , in  [ sec : grb ] , we discuss the implications of the grb phenomenologies , including the internal shock synchrotron model , the photosphere model , the afterglow , and polarizations of these phenomena .",
    "we solve the ideal special - relativistic mhd equations . because we treat propagation of relativistic shock waves and turbulent magnetic fields , a high - resolution shock - capturing scheme as well as a divergence - free induction - equation solver are preferred .",
    "we have developed such a code by using the five - wave harten - lax - van leer riemann solver @xcite developed by @xcite and the constrained transport scheme @xcite designed by @xcite .",
    "the five - wave hll solver employed in this paper is also called the hlld solver . according to @xcite ,",
    "hlld solver is more suited to treat magnetic field amplification by turbulence than other hll solvers .",
    "we impose the tm equation of state ( eos ) proposed by @xcite , which correctly describes the eos for nonrelativistic and relativistic temperature limits and can describe the transition regime that differs from the exact eos by less than 4% .",
    "we solve the equations in the conservative fashion so that the mass , momentum , and energy are conserved to within the round - off error .",
    "because we solve the scale - free , ideal ( relativistic ) mhd equations , we use a dimensionless time normalized by the light - crossing - time of the numerical domain @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the length of the numerical box along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "thus , for example , if we choose the scale @xmath7 cm , @xmath8 corresponds to 0.33 msec . for intuitive presentation , we treat variables such as density , velocity , pressure , and magnetic field dimensionally .",

    "we examine four situations that have density dispersions @xmath270.1 , 0.3 , 0.6 , and 0.9 , where @xmath28 .    to induce shock waves",
    ", we set the converging velocity field to @xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the speed of light , which indicates that the simulations are performed in a postshock rest frame when the upstream is uniform .",
    "the lorentz factor of the flows in the simulation frame is @xmath34 ( the relative lorentz factor of the flows is @xmath35 ) , which corresponds , for example , to the collision of the grb shells with @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the laboratory frame .",
    "the pre - shock temperature of the grb shell in the fireball model is usually too cold for our conservative numerical scheme to perform stable simulations ( see eq . [ [ eq : pret ] ] ) .",
    "thus , we increases the temperature to 9.38 mev for the purpose of numerical stability . by solving shock - jump conditions ,",
    "we have confirmed that the discrepancy of the average postshock conditions ( density , pressure , and magnetic field ) between the case of this warm preshock temperature and the cold - limit case ( @xmath38 k ) is only 3% because our initial temperature is still much lesser than the postshock temperature of @xmath39 gev .",
    "thus , we stress that our initial condition is sufficiently cold to generate realistic grb internal shock propagation .",
    "the initial magnetic field strength in the fluid rest frame is fixed at @xmath40 g ( @xmath41 g in the simulation frame ) oriented in the @xmath42 direction . as discussed in  6",
    ", if we assume the frozen - in transport of magnetic field from the central engine , this initial strength corresponds to a central engine magnetic field of @xmath43 g ( see , eq . [ [ eq : b0 ] ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed for the @xmath44 and @xmath6 boundaries . at the @xmath45 boundary",
    ", we continue to impose the converging relativistic flows in which density fluctuations same as the initial fluctuations are periodically input .",
    "the initial model parameters and the names of the runs are summarized in table 1 ( see also  [ sec : grb ] for the corresponding grb initial conditions ) .",
    "as shown in the next section , the set of simulations discussed in the preceding section can only treat the generation of turbulence and the growing phase of the magnetic field , because the induced shock waves rapidly exit the computational domain .",
    "to study the decay of turbulence and magnetic field , we need to perform long - term simulations . to do so ,",
    "we perform the following set of simulations : we prepare a cubic domain with @xmath46 having resolution @xmath47 .",
    "we fill the domain with an uniform medium whose density and temperature are @xmath48 @xmath21 and @xmath49 gev , respectively , which are compatible with the averaged postshock values obtained from the first set of simulations .",
    "turbulence is initially given by summing the sinusoidal velocity fluctuations with zero mean velocity : @xmath50 where the subscript @xmath51 covers @xmath52 , and @xmath6 , and @xmath53 is a random phase that depends on the wave number and the components . note that the summation is overall nonzero @xmath26 , and we generate fluctuating fields of @xmath54 to avoid creating superluminal regions .",
    "their power spectrum is the flat with cutoff scale @xmath55 in the generated initial velocity field thus generated , the ratio of the total power of the rotational velocity component ( @xmath56 ) to the compressive component ( @xmath57 ) is approximately 2:1 , which indicates that the initial turbulence is dominated by incompressible flows .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are imposed and we perform several runs with different initial velocity dispersions ( @xmath58 ) and initial magnetic field strengths , whose values are summarized in table 1 ( see also  [ sec : grb ] for the corresponding grb initial conditions ) .",
    "the initial converging flows used in the series of run a induce two oppositely propagating shock waves .",
    "when the shock wave passes a density bump or dent , a rmi is induced and leaves vorticity behind the shock waves .",
    "for the rayleigh - taylor instability , deformation of a discontinuity and generation of vorticity are triggered by gravitational acceleration , while the rmi is triggered by an impulsive acceleration caused by the passage of the shock wave @xcite .",
    "[ f1 ] ( a ) and ( c ) show two - dimensional number - density slices of the results of runs a1 and a3 , in which one can see the deformed shock fronts and turbulent density fields due to the rmi . in the following ,",
    "we plot the values measured in the simulation frame in figures , which is equivalent to the postshock rest frame when the upstream is uniform .",
    "since lower ( higher ) upstream density leads to faster ( slower ) shock propagation , the medium with larger density dispersion induces larger shock deformation , and thus leaves stronger vorticity or turbulence . to clarify this",
    ", we plot the dispersion of the sonic mach number in the @xmath44-@xmath6 plane at a given @xmath45 in fig .",
    "the red , blue , green , and magenta lines show the results of runs a1 , a2 , a3 , and a4 , respectively .",
    "series of the same color lines represent different temporal snapshots at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we also plot the reference lines of @xmath61 and 0.9 as dashed lines .",
    "it is obvious that larger preshock density dispersion introduces stronger postshock velocity dispersion , and that the velocity dispersion is roughly proportional to the preshock density dispersion .",
    "as the postshock mach number dispersion approaches unity , in particular run a1 , the mach number dispersion becomes somewhat smaller than that expected from the linear dependence on the density dispersion .",
    "this would be due to the formation of  eddy shocklets \" in the turbulent postshock @xcite that tend to keep the velocity dispersion subsonic .",
    "@xcite developed an analytic formula for the generation of vorticity because of an interaction between a relativistic shock and a density bump using the geometric shock - dynamics approximation ( see , also * ? ? ?",
    "they found that the vortical energy density generated by the interaction is proportional to the square of the maximum density of the bump ( in other words , the velocity dispersion of vorticity is proportional to the density contrast ) , when the density contrast is small . because they assumed ultra relativistic shock wave to study the afterglow phase of grbs , it may be inappropriate to compare their result and that of the mildly relativistic case examined here",
    ". however , note that our result ( linear dependence of the velocity dispersion on the preshock density dispersion when @xmath62 ) is consistent with their finding .",
    "in addition to the density bump - shock interaction , also note that the interaction with density dents also generates vorticity because the rmi is known to be effective even in that case .",
    "[ f2 ] shows that even when @xmath63 the level of the post shock velocity dispersion at around @xmath64 is almost the same as for @xmath65 , which indicates that the turbulence has not yet begun to decay . in the present simulations , the postshock velocity dispersion is nonrelativistic , and in newtonian fluid dynamics",
    ", it is widely known that the turbulence without a continuous driving source begins to decay within a few eddy - turnover times . because the average postshock sound speed is @xmath66 and the scale of vortices that is given essentially by the scale of the density fluctuations is @xmath67 , the eddy - turnover time",
    "can be estimated to be a few light - crossing times of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , to confirm the decay of turbulence , we need to continue the simulation for several light - crossing times , which requires a larger numerical domain .",
    "the decaying phase of turbulence will be shown in  4 as the results of the second set of simulations .",
    "in addition to the shock compression , the turbulence induced by the rmi amplifies the magnetic field by stretching the field lines .",
    "the slices of magnetic field strength distribution of runs a1 and a3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ( b ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "we can confirm the magnetic field amplification far beyond the value achieved by the shock compression alone ( if the preshock medium is uniform , the magnetic field strength is @xmath68 g ) .",
    "similar amplification of magnetic fields in the dynamics of snrs formed in various ambient ism has been reported by many authors ( see balsara et al .",
    "2001 for turbulent ism ; giacalone & jokipii 2007 for ism whose density fluctuation power spectrum is a power - law , which is recently applied to relativistic shocks by mizuno et al .",

    "the initial density fluctuations for our simulations are similar to that of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "thus , the amplification reported in the previous two - dimensional simulations seems suspicious @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such a dimensional difference stands out in the later - stage of driven turbulence , whereas the amplifications caused by density fluctuation - shock interaction is a short - term phenomenon .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field amplifications in our three - dimensional simulations suggests that the amplifications reported in the previous two - dimensional simulations are not fake , although the results of the two - dimensional simulations may be affected by the intemittency in some degree .",

    "because the employed numerical scheme is a conservative grid - based method , it is very difficult to treat a thin medium .",
    "the continuation of the simulation might be possible , if we artificially put the mass and internal energy into the thin regions . however , this strategy may significantly changes the dynamics because the volume - filling factor of such thin regions can be large .",
    "thus , we do not choose the continuation .",
    "although the timescale we have followed is short , the kinetic energy has already started to decay , whereas the magnetic energy is still in the growth phase .",
    "the model equation ( [ bevo ] ) with @xmath83 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , which is plotted as a dashed line in the middle panel of fig .",

    "the decay of the kinetic energy begins approximately ten times faster than that for the transonic cases , which we attribute to the shock dissipation that immediately converts kinetic energy into internal energy .",
    "indeed , a number of discontinuous density structures shown in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] indicate the formation of multiple shock waves .",
    "the beginning of the kinetic energy decay much faster than the eddy - turnover time is consistent with the simulations of decaying supersonic turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although these are nonrelativistic , isothermal simulations .",
    "note that , when the kinetic energy injected into the turbulence is fixed , the timescale of the decay of the relativistic turbulence would substantially shorter than the nonrelativistic one , since the relativistic effect reduces the necessary mass for deceleration by @xmath146 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath95 is completely different from the transonic and subsonic cases ( i.e. , @xmath95 decreases with time ) because the shock compression increases the internal energy more rapidly than the magnetic energy . as for transonic and subsonic turbulence",
    ", the magnetic energy would be able to grow until it becomes comparable to the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , @xmath95 can be turn to increase once the velocity dispersion of turbulence becomes subsonic and the increase in the internal energy due to the shock dissipation ceases , provided the magnetic energy is smaller than the kinetic energy up to that time .    therefore",
    ", the relativistic turbulence model for grbs @xcite does not seem to work because the relativistic turbulence decays much more rapidly than the eddy - turnover time @xmath147 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "using three - dimensional special - relativistic mhd simulations , we have studied the generation of turbulence as a consequence of the interactions between a relativistic shock wave and density fluctuations .",
    "we have found that the magnetic field is amplified due to the turbulence dynamo effect and follows a power - law decay in later stages .",
    "the following items are noteworthy :    * the velocity dispersion of turbulence induced by the density fluctuation - shock interaction roughly depends linearly on the dispersion of the preshock density inhomogeneity",
    ". it can be as large as the postshock sound speed when the dispersion of density fluctuations is on the order of the mean value ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "therefore , even if the shock is relativistic , the induced turbulence in our situation can not be as highly relativistic as postulated in @xcite model .",
    "* for transonic and subsonic turbulence , the induced turbulence maintains its strength for a few eddy - turnover times and then decays .",
    "in such a turbulent medium , until the turbulence begins to decay , the magnetic field is amplified exponentially in time according to eq .",
    "( [ bevo ] ) because of the effect of field - line stretching .",
    "the degree of amplification of the magnetic energy before the start of the turbulence decay is approximately 100 , regardless of the initial velocity dispersion of turbulence ( eq .",
    "[ [ bamp ] ] ) .",
    "the magnetic field continues to grow until the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy ( eq . [ [ bk ] ] ) after which the magnetic energy follows a power - law decay with an exponent of @xmath149 ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) .",
    "* the evolution of @xmath95 ( the ratio of the magnetic energy density to the internal energy density ) in the transonic and subsonic turbulence is similar to the magnetic energy , because the internal energy is almost constant during the evolution .",
    "we have found that when the initial @xmath95 immediately behind the shock is a few times @xmath151 , @xmath95 can grow on the order of 0.1 at maximum ( see fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) . *",
    "the critical length scale below which the back reaction of magnetic field on turbulence becomes effective is @xmath2th the initial inhomogeneity scale . at this scale ,",
    "the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the kinetic energy , and the kolmogorov cascade transitions to the mhd critical balance cascade .",
    "in addition , below this scale , spatial correlations of the local magnetic field orientation appears ( see  [ bstructure ] ) . * for relativistic supersonic turbulence ,",
    "the kinetic energy decay begins an order of magnitude faster than for the transonic case , because the formation of a number of shock waves directly dissipates the kinetic energy .",
    "the evolution of @xmath95 is completely different from the transonic and subsonic cases  it decreases even while the magnetic energy is growing because the increase in the internal energy by shock dissipations is faster than the magnetic field amplification .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we compare our results with previous related studies .",
    "using three - dimensional relativistic mhd simulations , @xcite recently showed that the turbulence induced by the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) in a relativistic shear flow amplifies the magnetic field .",
    "they found that @xmath95 converges to @xmath152 irrespective of its initial values of @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "our results , on the other hand , show that @xmath95 depends significantly on the initial value .",
    "the difference between the two results stems from the sources of turbulence . in the simulations of @xcite ,",
    "the shear flow is continuously injected by hand , which constantly drives the turbulence via the khi . on the other hand in our simulations , the turbulence that is expected to arise from the rmi",
    "is given only initially .",
    "considering these differences , we find that the results of the two simulations are essentially the same in the sense that the magnetic energy is deposited by turbulent flows induced by a hydrodynamic instability that saturates once it becomes as large as kinetic energy , and then the magnetic energy evolves along with the kinetic energy ( see , fig . 2 of zhang et al .",
    "2009 and fig .",
    "[ f5 ] herein ) .    the exponential growth of magnetic energy and the subsequent power - law decay obtained from our simulations is similar to the case of the weibel instability @xcite .",
    "the weibel instability is a powerful mechanism for the generation and amplification of magnetic fields .",
    "however , the typical scale of the magnetic field on the order of the plasma skin depth may be insufficient to contribute to particle acceleration .",
    "in addition , the magnetic fields generated at shock front decay rapidly .",
    "the advantage of magnetic field amplification by the rmi is in its spatial and time scales .",
    "because the scale of the rmi is determined by that of the preshock density fluctuations , the typical scale of magnetic field can be macroscopic and typically comparable to the causally connected scale ( i.e. , the maximum scale in the observable region ) .",
    "the results of our simulations can address various issues .",

    "* the comoving temperature of the freely expanding fireball is adiabatically cooled to @xmath171 whereas it rises to @xmath172 after the internal shocks ( followed by a similar adiabatic cooling ) . in the simulation ,",
    "we initially consider @xmath173 mev to ensure the numerical stability .",

    "the density inhomogeneity is also suggested by the observations such as the large variation in the prompt luminosity compared to that in the afterglow @xcite , the spectral and temporal varieties @xcite , and the variabilities of the early afterglow @xcite and its polarization ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we may take @xmath178 ( @xmath179 simulation box size ) as the fluctuation scale because the simulation is scale free .",
    "the internal shocks convert kinetic energy into internal energy , which goes into the magnetic field and the electron acceleration with energy fractions @xmath95 and @xmath180 .",
    "the electrons radiate synchrotron emission that is observed as the prompt grb .",

    "the poynting flux may be subdominant .",
    "it is interesting that the maximum level of magnetic energy depends on the initial magnetic field in the turbulence caused by the rmi instability ( see   [ sec : decay ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that a strong requirement for the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations is not necessary because the hundredfold growth of magnetic energy can be realized irrespective of the velocity dispersion of turbulence ( see , eq . [ [ bamp ] ] ) . as the dispersion of the density fluctuations",
    "is reduced , the velocity dispersion decreases , which results in a longer timescale for amplification . because the local magnetic field strength is distributed as shown in fig .",

    "however , even if the scale of the density inhomogeneities is much larger than @xmath201 , the magnetic field fluctuations induced by the rmi can scatter the electrons via magnetic mirror reflections .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently studied the transport of test particles in mhd turbulence , and found effective scattering of particles by magnetic bottles formed by large - scale slow - mode perturbations .",
    "the internal - shock synchrotron model has several crucial problems , one of which is the cooling problem @xcite .",
    "the cooling time for electrons with the characteristic lorentz factor @xmath203 is usually much shorter than the comoving causal time of @xmath204 , so that almost all electrons cool down to a lorentz factor @xmath205 .",
    "the corresponding cooling frequency @xmath206 is @xmath207 below the characteristic frequency @xmath208 . in this case",
    ", the low - energy spectral index below the peak energy ( @xmath208 ) becomes @xmath209 , which contradicts the harder observations @xmath210 .",
    "rmi turbulence could solve the cooling problem by continuously accelerating electrons through the stochastic acceleration so - called the second - order fermi acceleration in non - relativistic cases .",
    "the quasi - linear theory for electron scattering gives us the scattering timescale as @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the energy density fraction of the resonant turbulence to the background magnetic field , and @xmath213 is the larmor frequency .",
    "the simulation results show the non - linear turbulences ( @xmath214 ) , and the non - resonant scattering may be essential as we mentioned before . in spite of those issues , extrapolating this formula with @xmath215 , the scattering timescale is estimated as @xmath216 , which is significantly shorter than the cooling timescale .",
    "since the mildly relativistic turbulence leads to the energy variance per scattering @xmath217 , the heating timescale due to the turbulences may be siginificant .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the second - order fermi acceleration balances synchrotron cooling , so that the low - energy spectral index becomes as hard as @xmath218@xmath219 , consistent with the observations .",
    "in their monte carlo simulations of acceleration , the mean collision time of pitch - angle scattering is assumed to be independent of electron energy . according to the measurement of the test - particle collision frequency in mhd turbulence by @xcite ,",
    "the collision frequency is independent of energy because the particles are mainly scattered by magnetic bottles formed by large - scale slow - mode perturbations .",
    "thus we can expect the second - order fermi acceleration in the post - shock turbulent region .",
    "@xcite also demonstrated that if the electron collision frequency decreases with time , the accelerated electrons can reproduce the band spectrum , including its high - energy side .",
    "their assumption is compatible with our simulation results , because the turbulence we are discussing is time dependent ; its magnetic energy decays with time at a later stage , which leads to decreasing collision frequency .",
    "the direct numerical simulations including the particle acceleration , which would be feasible by applying the test - particle approximation , is necessary to quantitatively confirm these expectations .",
    "another possibility to solve the cooling problem might be to consider that the eddy scale ( i.e. , the density fluctuation scale ) is much smaller than the comoving causal scale . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , the magnetic field decays within a few eddy - turnover times .",
    "if the decay timescale is comparable to the cooling timescale of electrons of @xmath203 , emissions from cooled electrons are suppressed .",
    "then , the low - energy spectral index becomes that of the synchrotron , @xmath218 , consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "however note that the radiative efficiency becomes too small unless the decay times is fine tuned to the cooling time .",
    "we also comment on the jitter radiation @xcite , in which small - scale turbulences lead to average deflections much smaller than the beaming angle and a low - energy spectral index @xmath220 harder than that for the synchrotron , as observed in a fraction of grbs . because the larmor radius @xmath221 , or more precisely @xmath222 , is much smaller than the typical magnetic field scale , which is roughly one - tens of the scale of initial density fluctuations ( below which the power spectrum decreases as shown in figs .",
    "[ f7 ] and [ f10 ] ) , the jitter radiation does not work for macroscopic rmi turbulence .",
    "an interesting prediction of the synchrotron model with rmi turbulence is the polarization of the prompt grb .",
    "since the typical scale of the magnetic field is @xmath120 ( i.e. , @xmath2th the fluctuation scale of @xmath223 ) , the number of domains with coherent magnetic field would be at least @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , the polarization degree should be less than @xmath225 @xcite , which may be probed by the future x - ray polarimetric observations @xcite .",
    "if the polarization of the prompt grb is above this limit , we have to consider mechanism other than the synchrotron model via rmi turbulence , such as the magnetic field advected from the central engine .",
    "even if the band component at mev range is produced by a mechanism other than synchrotron ( e.g. , photosphere emission , which is discussed in the next section ) , the extra high - energy component recently identified by the fermi satellite @xcite may require emissions from non - thermal particles .",
    "the extra components can be explained by several models such as early onset of the afterglow @xcite , upscattering of external / photospheric photons @xcite , and hadronic pair cascade @xcite .",
    "for those models , the magnetic field amplification and turbulences to produce non - thermal particles are indispensable .",
    "another interesting method to emit gev photons is the internal shock synchrotron with high lorentz factor recently proposed by @xcite . in such cases",

    "( [ eq : num ] ) ( @xmath228 ) , the rising segment of the @xmath229 spectrum is stretched down below @xmath230 kev over more than 7 energy digits , as observed . in the high lorentz factor model , the maximum synchrotron frequency",
    "is limited by the magnetic field decay time @xmath231 , where @xmath232 is the ratio of the decay time to the comoving causal time and the right hand side is the electron acceleration time ( with @xmath233 for the bohm limit ) @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath234 therefore , to produce high - energy photons , @xmath235 is necessary , i.e. , the eddy - turnover time @xmath236 should be comparable with the causal time .",

    "the photosphere model can naturally achieve the high efficiency and the hard low - energy spectrum .",
    "the only crucial flaw is that the spectrum tends to be thermal without the nonthermal tails observed in grbs .",
    "the electrons with mildly relativistic temperature can upscatter the thermal photons to produce a high energy tail ( @xcite , see also similar simulations for agns , @xcite ) , but the mechanism to keep electron temperature higher than photon temperature is not self - evident .    a probable solution is the rmi turbulence excited just below the photosphere , which could convert the thermal spectrum into the observed nonthermal spectrum through comptonization .",
    "this is similar to the @xcite model , which employs alfvn turbulence rather than the rmi turbulence .",
    "if the turbulent velocity is mildly relativistic and the thompson optical depth is about unity ( i.e. , just below the photosphere ) , the compton @xmath44-parameter is approximately unity . in this case , if the turbulent kinetic energy is comparable or larger than the radiation energy , photons are statistically upscattered above the peak energy into a broken power - law ( band - like ) spectrum .",
    "note that electrons are , in a sense , continuously heated because they move together with protons in macroscopic turbulence , i.e. , @xmath238 is effectively achieved .",
    "for the high - radiative efficiency of grb , it is necessary that the turbulent energy is just comparable with the radiation energy . in the rmi turbulence model ,",
    "this is naturally achieved by the relativistic shock just below the photosphere , where the density is so low that the internal energy ( i.e. , microscopic motion of matter ) is not effectively thermalized into radiation in the post shock .",
    "hence , the pressure balance between the radiation and the matter behind the shock automatically leads to near equipartition of radiation and turbulent energy @xcite .    according to the simulation presented in fig .  [ f2 ] , the turbulent velocity dispersion is larger for larger density fluctuations and its maximum is @xmath239 ( run a1 ) . in this case , the compton @xmath44-parameter is @xmath240 where the dependence on @xmath241 is not square because the fireball is expanding with decreasing @xmath241 .",

    "<S> relativistic astrophysical phenomena such as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei often require long - lived strong magnetic field that can not be achieved by shock compression alone . here </S>",
    "<S> , we report on three - dimensional special - relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations that we performed using a second - order godunov - type conservative code , to explore the amplification and decay of macroscopic turbulence dynamo excited by the so - called richtmyer - meshkov instability ( rmi ; a rayleigh - taylor type instability ) . </S>",
    "<S> this instability is an inevitable outcome of interactions between shock and ambient density fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetic energy grows exponentially in a few eddy - turnover times , because of field - line stretching , and then , following the decay of kinetic turbulence , decays with a temporal power - law exponent of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic - energy fraction can reach @xmath1 but depends on the initial magnetic field strength , which can diversify the observed phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetic energy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic energy immediately behind the shock , provided the kinetic energy of turbulence injected by the rmi is larger than the magnetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum degree of the amplification does not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations , while the growth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of inhomogeneity in the density . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from kolmogorov cascade to mhd critical balance cascade occurs at @xmath2th the initial inhomogeneity scale , which limits the maximum synchrotron polarization to less than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytical formulas for these numerical results and apply them to grbs . </S>",
    "<S> new results include the avoidance of electron cooling with rmi turbulence , the turbulent photosphere model via rmi , and the shallow decay of the early afterglow from rmi . </S>",
    "<S> we also performed a simulation of freely decaying turbulence with relativistic velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that relativistic turbulence begins to decay much faster than one eddy - turnover time because of fast shock dissipation , which does not support the relativistic turbulence model by narayan & kumar . </S>"
