    "interaction of a two - level system with a plane traveling wave leads to one - photon transitions between energy levels and consequent changes of total atomic momentum in limits of one photon momentum @xmath1 .",
    "what can be said about distributions and mean values of momentum for each individual atomic level ?",
    "the answer is well - known and is trivial , if the atom before the interaction is on one of the energy levels : distribution on the other level sets shift @xmath1 and mean values of momentum distinguished also by @xmath0 ; @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are mean values of momentum on ground and excited levels consequently ( @xmath5 case).what would we have in general case , that is , when the atom before the interaction with the travelling wave is in the superposition state of ground and excited levels with mutually different momentum distributions there ? in the following just this question will be elucidated in details : in general form in sec . 2 , and the special case of preparing standing wave , latter .",
    "2 it will be shown that in one - photon absorption / emission process , in general , large scale redistributions of the energy level s momenta takes place .",
    "this entails the time - changes of the @xmath6 @xmath7 and these changes can greatly exceed the value of one photon momentum . in general , the relations @xmath2 are not true , too .    in sec .",
    "3 we will discuss from the practical point of view a very important case , when the preliminary superposition state of the atom is realized by the coherent diffraction of the atom in the field of resonant standing wave , which is being often referred to us the resonant kapitza - dirac effect .",
    "will be pointed out , that the redistribution of momenta in the travelling can be received as a transition from the resonant kapitza - dirac splitting to the stern - gerlach type splitting . in sec .",
    "4 will be discussed the temporal behavior of the energy level s mean momenta .",
    "the results are summarized in sec . 5 , where the possibility of experimental observation of this phenomenon will be sketched too .",
    "let s discuss the resonant interaction of a two - level atom with the radiation field @xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , suppose the field has plane wavefront , linear polarization ( these assumptions will be conserved for the standing wave , discussed in sec.3 ) , turns on instantly and after on it s amplitude remains constant .",
    "let the wave functions of free two - level atom s ground ( @xmath8 ) and excited ( @xmath9 ) levels be @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , where@xmath12 is atomic internal coordinate ( radius - vector of the optical electron relative to the atomic center - of - mass )",
    ". the wave function of interacting atom will be @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the probability amplitudes of the atom to be on the ground and excited levels correspondingly .",
    "when taking into account translational motion of the atomic center of mass , it is necessary to separate respective parts ( wave functions ) in @xmath14 and @xmath15 coefficients .",
    "if , for example , the atom on thw energy level has the well - defined value of momentum @xmath16 , the respective wave function is given by function @xmath17 that is , by the exponential function with imaginarily degree .",
    "in general , when on energy levels an atom hasnt definite values of momentum , @xmath14 and @xmath15 coefficients will be expressed by the series of @xmath18-states : @xmath19 with probability amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 of atom to have momentum @xmath22 ( at the @xmath23 moment of time ) , simultaneously being on the ground or excited energy levels , correspondingly .    inserting the expressions ( [ 1])-([3 ] ) into the quantum mechanical determination of atom momentum @xmath24 and doing the standard transformations we arrive to @xmath25 the first member specifies the contribution of the ground energy level in total momentum , @xmath26 accordingly",
    ", the second member specifies the excited level s contribution , @xmath27 both these momenta are time - dependent and their change for @xmath23 time of interaction will be    @xmath28    when the atom interacts with the travelling wave , the coefficient @xmath20 of ground level relates with the coefficient @xmath29 of excited level ( spontaneous transitions are not taken into account ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) . as a result",
    "we get    @xmath30    by this relation we can connect @xmath31 with @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the change of ground level s population , or which is the same , the population change @xmath36 of excited level with the opposite sign ( see [ 16 ] ) . from the equality of the first and last parts of ( [ 8 ] )",
    "directly follows the well known inequality between the momentum of photon and total atom : @xmath37 let , nevertheless , note that this one photon demarcafationpertains to the total momentum of the atom , but not to the momentum of ground and excited levels , separately .",
    "their changes , in accordance with ( [ 6a ] ) and ( [ 6b ] ) , in principle , may be arbitrary , depending on distributions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in momentum space . from the expressions ( [ 6a ] ) and ( [ 6b ] ) also is obvious that for @xmath40 @xmath41 to get great values , is necessary the distribution of @xmath38 ( of @xmath39 ) to be strictly non - symmetric , relative to the replacement @xmath42 and to have a gathering in the range of great values of @xmath43 .    and now let s show that one photon absorption/ emission process in the field of travelling wave really allows a behavior , mentioned above .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , in dipole approximation , may be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the free atom hamiltonian , and @xmath46 is the dipole moment operator and @xmath47 is the electric field , whose @xmath48 frequency is equal to the @xmath49 frequency of bohr transition .    from schrodinger equation for @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath51 amplitudes we arrive to    @xmath52    the rabi - solutions of which are @xcite    @xmath53    where @xmath54 represents the rabi frequency , @xmath55 .",
    "performing @xmath56-expansion ( see ( 3 ) ) in ( [ 13a ] ) and ( [ 13b ] ) , we obtain    @xmath57    at first , it is readily verified that if the atom is on one of energy levels before the interaction , the extraordinary things does nt take place . really , if for example @xmath58 , then    @xmath59 ,   \\label{15b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    that is the contribution of momentum per energy level evolves periodically and this is the evolution merely caused by periodic exchange of population between the energy levels ( posed by the term @xmath60 .",
    "note also that in conditions under consideration the momentum distributions coincide with each other with a shift @xmath1 : @xmath61 @xmath20 tg@xmath62 , as was mentioned in introduction .",
    "the situation is totally diverse , if the atom is initially in superposition state of ground and excited levels , because now the initial momentum distributions on the ground and excited levels are not under necessity to be identical with shift @xmath1 : @xmath63 @xmath64 in general ( @xmath65 is some constant , independent of @xmath16 ) .",
    "then , it follows unavoidably from ( [ 14a ] ) and ( [ 14b ] ) that the optical transition , besides the changes on the energy levelspopulations , leads also to periodic evolutions in the form of momentum distributions there . herewith the atomic amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nt mutually proportional ( with any constant shift ) .    to wash out the contributions , appropriate to evolution of the energy level populations , let introduce a pair of new quantities , @xmath3 and @xmath66 , which would be scaled in units of level - populations @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively :    @xmath69    @xmath70    since these new quantities are already independent on level populations , their possible evolutions would be stipulated by form - deformations in the energy levels momentum distributions .",
    "afterwards we will call them mean momenta of ground energy level ( @xmath3 ) and of excited energy level ( @xmath4 ) correspondingly .. thereby the total momentum of atom , in addition to ( [ 5 ] ) , can be presented in the following more convenient form : @xmath71 these mean momenta , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , remain constant , of course , if the atom is initially on one of the energy levels .",
    "they remain constant also when the initial distributions are mutually proportional with constant shift @xmath1 : @xmath72 really , putting ( [ 18 ] ) in relations ( [ 14a ] ) and ( [ 14b ] ) making the obvious substitutions , we arrive to @xmath73 for ground energy level , and @xmath74 for excited energy level . in these circumstances in ( [",
    "17 ] ) the time evolution exhibit only energy level populations @xmath68 and @xmath67 .    in the general case , nevertheless , the evolution of state is due to interference of non - similarly distributed amplitudes , the atomic amplitudes distributions on energy levels are nt proportional with each other yet and , as a consequence , mean momenta @xmath4 and @xmath3 get temporal evolution , too .    for acquisition of more concrete and quantitative results , let s note that for the intentions of atom optics and interferometry@xcite the coherent scattering of atoms in the resonant field of standing wave is the routine for preparation of large spreaded momentum distribution .",
    "the probability amplitudes , prepared in a such way , ca nt satisfy the undesirablecondition ( [ 18 ] ) in principle , since in the field of standing wave .",
    "as is well known , any state with momentum @xmath16 on one energy level is connected with the two - states on other energy level with momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 simultaneously .",
    "therefore , any atom prepared by means of resonant kapitza - dirac effect , during its later interaction with the travelling wave , ought to implicitly change the momentum distributions on energy levels with following to it above mentioned consequences .",
    "let before the interaction with the travelling wave , during time @xmath77 , the atom had coherent interaction with the resonant ( @xmath78 ) standing wave @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the relatively simple case , when the interaction proceeds by the well known scheme of mutually orthogonal atom - standing wave beams .",
    "moreover , the raman - nath approximation will be employed , which permit to put out from the problem at hand the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian ( note that the kinetic energy term has not been included into ( [ 10 ] ) too ) .",
    "although the scheme of calculation is well known and presented in details ( see , for example , in @xcite , @xcite , we find it convenient to give an account of main intermediate formulas , too .    to describe the interaction in the preparing standing wave , the electric field ( [ 11 ] ) in the hamiltonian ( [ 10 ] )",
    "must be exchanged by @xmath79    in consequence , the atomic amplitudes @xmath80 and @xmath81 have to fulfill ( [ 12a],[12b])-type equations where the following replacements must be performed : @xmath82 ( which is mean rabi frequency in the standing wave ) , @xmath83 . allowing that the atom has been on the ground level before the interaction @xmath84 , we arrive to    @xmath85    these amplitudes at the moment @xmath86 , when the standing wave is turned off , just present the initial amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 for interaction with the travelling wave ( see the formulas ( [ 13a],[13b ] ) . using their @xmath18-expantions",

    "the formulas ( [ 22a])-([22c ] ) contain explicitly the seeking result about the evolution of momentum distributions . to exhibit this evolution ,",
    "let first note that the initial momentum distribution for both energy levels are symmetric relative to value @xmath93 . really , they are specified by @xmath94 and @xmath95 functions for ground and excited energy levels respectively and are symmetric , relative to @xmath96 , @xmath97 transformations , that is just relative to value @xmath98 @xmath99 .",
    "this symmetry signifies that the momentum of each energy level ( as the incremental ( [ 5 ] ) , as the mean ( [ 17 ] ) values ) is zero @xcite before the interaction with the travelling wave .",
    "nevertheless the symmetry breaks under the influenceof travelling wave : one photon absorption / emission process , in accordance with ( [ 22a ] ) and ( [ 22b ] ) , gives the beginning of asymmetric transformations in the form of momentum distributions , periodically running in opposite directions for ground and excited energy levels .    a typical form of initial distributions and the following redistributions ( due to single - photon process )",
    "are depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig33 ] for ground and excited energy levels consequently .",
    "single - photon large - scale changes are apparent .",
    "now let notice that in conditions of fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig33 ] we get almost one - side distributions : the translational states with @xmath100 for ground energy level only , and the translational states with @xmath101 for excited level only .",
    "so , the state of total atom has been explited into two sub - groups , where one sub - group presents ground - level atoms with negative values of momentum , and the second sub - group presents vice - versa , the excited - level atoms with negative values of momentum .",
    "of course , this is a stern - gerlach type splitting .",
    "that is , one - photon optical transition implements the resonant kapitza - dirac splitting into the stern - gerlach type splitting .",
    "the phenomenon of one - photon coherent accumulation of momentum on energy levels ( op - camel ) , may get some expansion in exhibition , if the initial momentum distributions would be taken in asymmetric form .",
    "this kind of distributions also can be obtained by the standing wave , but if some travelling wave is previous to it @xcite . such sequence of pulses is got , if the standing wave is formed by means of reflection of a laser pulse from the distanted ( from atomic beam ) mirror ( see , for example @xcite , ) . to avoid the overloading of the text we are nt going to bring formulas and the behavior of the op - camel in these conditions",
    "will be given only by some graphs . in fig .",
    "[ fig44 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig55 ] is presented the case when the momentum distribution in resonant kapitza - dirac splitting is maximum asymmetric .",
    "as is seen from the graphs , in this special case op - camel appears already as a accumulation of asymmetry on one ( ground ) energy level for account of its suppressing on the other ( excited ) energy level .",
    "let us now return to the preparation only by the standing wave and discuss the evolution of momenta @xmath3 and @xmath4 . by means of expressions for the quantities defining @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see ( [ 16 ] ) ,",

    "population changes , which also are responsible for the evolutions in general , are depicted in figures by dashed lines . in presented case",
    "the populations are constant in practice , which follows from ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 24 ] ) too , if we take into account @xmath113 for @xmath114 . and ,",
    "finally , the temporal evolution of mean momenta @xmath109 and @xmath115 conditioned solaly by redistributions of momentumon the energy levels , is shown already in fig .",
    "[ fig88 ] and [ fig99 ] .",
    "the parameters of the preparing standing wave are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] , where the distance between left - hand and right - hand maximums ( the width of momentum distribution ) is about @xmath116 @xmath1 .",
    "such magnitudes for the resonant kapitza - dirac splitting are totally in limits of experimental realizations @xcite .",
    "note also , that the comparison of the deviation of @xmath109 or @xmath115 ( from the fig . [ fig88 ] and [ fig99 ] ) and the width of momentum distribution ( from the [ fig22 ] ) shows the same order of magnitude for them .",
    "since the width of momentum distribution has multiphoton nature ( created by means of multiphoton process of reemission of photons from one wave into the counterpropagating one ) , the large -scale variations in op - camel may be called as multiphoton .",
    "multiphoton op - camel  manifests itself in ( [ 23 ] ) , ( [ 24 ] ) formulas in following way .",
    "when the initial momentum distribution is sufficiently widespread , that is @xmath117 then @xmath118 ( from the theory of resonant kapitza - dirac effect the connection between the momentum width @xmath119 and the number of rabi - flops @xmath120 is @xmath121 ) ) . under this condition the members @xmath122 @xmath1 @xmath123 in ( [ 23 ] ) and @xmath124 @xmath1 @xmath125 in ( [ 24 ] ) , being proportional to @xmath126 , stand out as the previal terms and just present the multiphoton op - camel .",
    "a simple theoretical consideration of optical transition in general conditions , when the atom initially has in superposition state of ground and excited energy levels different momentum distributions , shows that one one - photon optical transition leads to radical asymmetric changes in momentum distributions on each energy level . saying in images , in general one photon changes the mean momentum of energy level more than photon s own momentum .",
    "in important case , when the preliminary superposition state of the atom is being prepared by coherent scattering at the resonant standing wave , the phenomenon can be presented as a transition from resonant kapitza - dirac splitting of atomic translational states to stern - gerlach type splitting .",
    "this is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1010 ] .    finally , let s give an account of some remarks about the possibility of experimental observation of phenomenon .",
    "firs let s notice that the non - opticalmethods , which registrate the total atom ( for example hot - wiremethod ) , ca nt be used for this purpose , because the phenomenon deals with each individual energy level ; the momentum distribution of total atom does nt change or which will be more right , it changes only in one - photon momentum limits .",
    "it is preferable to use registration methods , that will deal only with one of resonantly connected energy levels , such as the adjacent optical transitions .",
    "then the phenomenon will appear itself as a pronounced asymmetry in profile of doppler broadening , relative to bohr frequency .",
    "another possibility we see in using of long - living energy levels , so long that the atomic translational states can be distinguished in space till the spontaneous emission ( c zone in fig .",
    "[ fig1010 ] ) . in this case",
    "the space - sensitive schemes of spontaneous emission collection or probe pulse absorption will bring to desirable result .",
