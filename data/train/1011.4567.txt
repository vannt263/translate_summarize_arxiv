    "density - functional theory ( dft )  @xcite is the leading theoretical framework for studying the electronic properties of matter . its approach is _ ab - initio _ , which means that in principle , the only necessary input for the theory is the external potential @xmath2 and the total number of electrons @xmath3 ; no experimental data is required .",
    "dft is currently applied to a variety of many - electron systems  @xcite : along with traditional applications to atoms , molecules and solids , dft is used for studying nano - objects , vacancies and impurities , surfaces and even dna .",
    "the applications in all these fields are , obviously , interrelated .",
    "the many - body physics of coulomb - interacting electron systems is represented in dft by the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy functional @xmath4 .",
    "it is non - local , spin - dependent , it has non - analytical properties , and its exact form is not known  @xcite . there exist , however , many approximations to this functional ( e.g.  @xcite ) , based on numerical results for the homogeneous electron gas  @xcite and asymptotic analytical derivations ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . the validity of alternative approximations can only be determined by testing them on a wide range of systems , in comparison to the experimental data .",
    "several reasons motivate us to explore atomic systems with dft .",
    "first , atoms are possibly the simplest physical systems dft can describe , and they are relatively easy to solve numerically .",
    "second , in atoms a wide spectrum of electron - electron interactions takes place , e.g.  closed - shell , open - shell , magnetic , relativistic , strongly correlated systems and others .",
    "such a diversity creates a challenge to any approximation to the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "third , there exists a large and highly accurate experimental database on atoms and ions  @xcite .",
    "both the ionization energies and the spectroscopic terms can be found for all atoms in the periodic table .",
    "therefore , a systematic comparison of numerical findings to precise experimental results is possible . for these reasons , atomic systems provide a `` playground '' to test physical approximations and numerical algorithms within dft .",
    "last but not least , since atoms serve as building blocks of more complicate material systems , a deeper understanding of atoms and ions , and as a result - their better description , can improve our ability to model real materials .",
    "atomic systems have been extensively investigated with dft in the last four decades .",
    "as early as 1966 , tong and sham  @xcite published density - functional calculations for several alkali and rare gas atoms using a spin - unpolarized local density approximation .",
    "the study by moruzzi , janak and williams  @xcite ( although mainly focused on crystals ) presented numerical results for a large group of atoms .",
    "the total energies of atoms were obtained within a spin - polarized version of dft , using the lda form by von barth and hedin  @xcite . in this work and in subsequent work by janak",
    "@xcite , the problem of fractional occupations in the kohn - sham reference system for the fe and co atoms was discussed explicitly . however , since the physical significance of unequal occupations of degenerate levels in the reference system was not fully understood at that time , the authors  @xcite questioned their findings in this regard . furthermore",
    ", these initial studies did not include any results for ions , nor the ionization energies of atoms .",
    "subsequent to several partial studies  @xcite , kotochigova _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed all atoms and their first ions in the periodic table with local approximations to the xc - energy .",
    "these approximations included both spin - polarized and unpolarized functionals , within both relativistic and non - relativistic regimes .",
    "the agreement of the lsda ionization energies with experimental data was found to be reasonable .",
    "however , the electronic configurations of the atoms and ions employed in that study were not obtained _ ab - initio_. for some systems the energy - minimization process was restricted in a manner that prevented it from converging to the global minimum and may produce erroneous results , as will be discussed below .    all results in the aforementioned works",
    "were obtained using the local ( spin- ) density approximation ( l(s)da ) .",
    "a systematic investigation of atomic systems with functionals constructed using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) has not yet been published .",
    "however , lee and martin  @xcite have calculated the total energies for atoms with @xmath5 obtained in an unpolarized calculation with pbe  @xcite and pw91  @xcite gga s and with lsda(pz ) approximations  @xcite .",
    "ionization energies for atoms with @xmath6 in a spin - polarized calculation were also presented .",
    "the authors found that pbe - gga results for the total energies improve the lda results considerably , while for the ionization energies pbe - gga is only slightly better than the lsda .",
    "surprisingly , none of the studies mentioned above , regardless of the approximations used , analyzes how well do dft calculations predict the spin of atoms and ions .    since the latest comprehensive works on density - functional theory of atoms , two major advances have taken place",
    "first , questions of @xmath1-representability and differentiability of density - functionals in dft have been clarified . with respect to atomic calculations , ( a )",
    "the use of unequal fractional occupation of degenerate energy levels in the kohn - sham reference system has been found to be mathematically allowed and physically justified  @xcite ; ( b ) the use of excited states of the kohn - sham system in order to describe a ground state of the real system has been shown to be forbidden  @xcite .",
    "second , a numerical algorithm designed to treat atomic systems with ensemble @xmath1-representable ground - state densities was proposed  @xcite , which allows for fractional occupation of degenerate ks levels .",
    "the algorithm was illustrated for the fe atom - a well - known ensemble @xmath1-representable ( evr ) system  @xcite .",
    "to conclude , the limitations of previous work and recent developments in density - functional theory suggest the need for a new comprehensive study for atoms and ions with dft , which will _ ab - initio _ determine the ks electronic configuration , making it possible to obtain the spin , the total and ionization energies without relying on experimental findings , thus testing the approximations to the xc - energy employed .    in the current contribution we present results of self - consistent _ ab - initio _ non - relativistic dft calculations for atoms and their first ions with @xmath7 , within the spherical approximation for the density . the objectives of this paper are : ( i ) to obtain _ ab - initio _ the spin , @xmath8 , of the atoms and ions in the kohn - sham dft scheme and compare it with experimental results ; ( ii ) to explore the difference between the total and the ionization energies obtained while determining the occupation numbers _ ab - initio _ to those obtained using the empirically assigned occupation numbers  @xcite ; ( iii ) to systematically test the effect of including the pbe - gga on the energies and spins of atoms and ions , relative to the lsda ; ( iv ) to examine the quantitative difference between the ionization energies and the spins obtained while using various parametrizations for the correlation energy  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec.theory ] provides the theoretical background , in sec .",
    "[ sec.num ] the numerical details concerning atomic calculations are discussed and sec .",
    "[ sec.results ] presents the numerical results for all atoms and ions with @xmath7 .",
    "these include the total energy @xmath9 , the first ionization energy @xmath10 , the spin @xmath8 and the kohn - sham electronic configuration .",
    "the results obtained are compared to previous calculations from the literature  @xcite , as well as to experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "[ sec.discussion ] contains a discussion .",
    "possible reasons for existing discrepancies are provided , and ways to reduce those in future research are proposed .",
    "a non - relativistic many - electron system is described  @xcite by the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electron mass , @xmath3 is the number of electrons in the system , @xmath2 is the external potential , which equals @xmath13 for atoms and ions .",
    "according to the hohenberg - kohn ( hk ) theorems  @xcite , the ground state density determines all the properties of a many - electron system . in the spin - dependent version of dft , the total - energy functional @xmath14",
    "$ ] can be represented as @xmath15 = \\int v \\ , n \\ , d^3r + f_{hk}[n_{\\uparrow},n_{\\downarrow}],\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the partial densities of electrons with the spin @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the total density and @xmath21 is the hohenberg - kohn functional , which is independent of the particular electron system , i.e.  of @xmath1 .",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath21 is not known , and it is usually approximated using the kohn - sham ( ks ) approach  @xcite introducing an auxiliary system of non - interacting electrons subject to an effective potential @xmath22 , which is chosen so that the density of the ks system equals the density of the interacting system . in spin - dft ,",
    "two coupled auxiliary systems are used to reproduce @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is well - known that the densities in some atomic systems are _ ensemble_- ( rather than _ pure - state- _ ) @xmath1-representable  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following all the expressions are generalized to include ensembles , employing the results of previous studies  @xcite .",
    "in particular , lieb s extension to the hk functional  @xcite is used , and it is denoted @xmath23 below .    within the ks system , solving one - particle schrdinger equations @xmath24 one obtains the eigenvalues @xmath25 and the orbitals @xmath26 of the ks system , some of which can be degenerate .",
    "the total energy of the @xmath27-ks system is given by @xmath28 =   \\int v_{e{\\mbox{\\footnotesize{\\emph{ff}}}},{\\sigma } } n_{\\sigma}d^3r + t_l[n_{\\sigma}],\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is lieb s kinetic energy functional  @xcite for the ks system .",
    "the expression for the effective potential is found by applying euler s differential relations to both the interacting and the ks systems : @xmath30 @xmath31 = 0.\\ ] ] the effective potential has the form ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath32({\\vec r } ) = v({\\vec r } ) + v_h[n ] + v_{xc,{\\sigma}}[n_{\\uparrow},n_{\\downarrow}]$ ] , where @xmath33 = e^2 \\int n(\\vec{r'})/|\\vec r - \\vec{r'}| d^3r'$ ] is known as the hartree potential and @xmath34:= \\frac{\\delta e_{xc}}{\\delta n_{\\sigma } } = \\frac{\\delta f_l}{\\delta n_{\\sigma } } - \\frac{\\delta t_l}{\\delta n_{\\sigma } } - v_h[n]\\ ] ] is the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "the total energy of the interacting system can be expressed in terms of the ks system as @xmath35 + t_l[n_{\\downarrow } ] + \\int v \\",
    ", n \\ , d^3r + e_h[n ] + e_{xc}[n_{\\uparrow},n_{\\downarrow}],\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath4 are the hartree and the exchange - correlation energies , respectively",
    ".    it is evident , therefore , that in the ks approach the functionals @xmath23 and @xmath29 have to be differentiable with respect to the densities @xmath37 .",
    "the question of differentiability was discussed extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the partial densities must be non - interacting ensemble @xmath1-representable ( ni - evr ) , i.e.  to have the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the occupation numbers , which obey @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the energy of the @xmath42th ks level of the @xmath27-system , @xmath43 is the maximal number of electrons that can occupy the @xmath42-th level , @xmath44 and @xmath45 $ ] are the energy and the occupation of the highest occupied level(s ) , which can be fractional .",
    "the kinetic energy then equals @xmath46 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e } \\sum_{i } g_{i{\\sigma } } { \\langle\\psi_{i{\\sigma}}|\\nabla^2|\\psi_{i{\\sigma}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ]    it is emphasized  @xcite that the occupation numbers @xmath47 are not free parameters , as was previously suggested  @xcite .",
    "all systems that satisfy this restriction are termed below _",
    "proper_.    @xmath8 , the @xmath48-projection of the total spin ( referred to in this article as _ spin _ ) is a functional of the partial densities @xmath49 : @xmath50 therefore , the spin of the ks system is identical to the spin of the interacting system .",
    "however , the occupation numbers @xmath51 are internal quantities of the ks systems determined by eq .",
    "( [ gi_evr ] ) .",
    "they are not necessarily equal to the occupation numbers that are available in the experimental literature for atoms  @xcite .",
    "the latter ( referred to in this work as _ empirical _ ) are derived from the independent - electron model of the atom ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "x ) ) to satisfy the spectroscopic terms deduced from measured emission spectra , and _ can not _ be explicitly related to their counterparts in the ks system .",
    "the spin @xmath8 is determined in the ks scheme by finding the minimum total energy for different spin values of the non - interacting reference system .",
    "these calculations are performed employing an approximate exchange correlation functional which is a possible source of error in determining the energy and therefore creates uncertainty in the calculated total spin . since the spin is a half - integral number , which can increase or decrease by unit value only , then the validity of the calculated result is determined by the magnitude of the energy difference between the system with spin @xmath8 and the same system with spin @xmath52 .",
    "the larger this energy difference is , the less likely it leads to an incorrect conclusion regarding the spin of the system .",
    "if the energy difference is small , then a small change in the exchange correlation energy could cause the order of the energies to change and therefore the predicted total spin of the system ( see secs .",
    "[ res.gga ] and [ res.compare.prmtrz ] ) .    with respect to differentiability",
    ", two results were recently obtained  @xcite .",
    "first , it was shown that the use of excited states of the ks system to describe a ground state of the interacting system is not allowed .",
    "it can be claimed that a density that emerges in some ks systems from an excited state ( i.e.  that does not obey eq .",
    "( [ gi_evr ] ) ) can be obtained also as a ground state of another ks system , so the differentiability is assured .",
    "then , however , euler s relations ( [ euler1]),([euler2 ] ) can not be satisfied for both ks systems simultaneously , so the kohn - sham method can not be applied .",
    "second , for spin - polarized dft , each of the partial densities @xmath49 has to obey eqs .",
    "( [ ns_evr]),([gi_evr ] ) , but there can be gaps in the occupation of the whole system if the first vacant level of one of the subsystems lies below the last occupied level of the another one .",
    "we call such systems _ proper in a broad sense _ ( b.s . ) .",
    "this situation arises because we are constrained from having partial occupation of states with a different spin , by the physical requirement that the spin is half - integer .",
    "it is emphasized here that a b.s .- proper density obeys all the required restrictions related to a rigorous definition and differentiability of energy functionals , thus it can serve as a legitimate candidate for a solution of a many - electron system . a b.s .",
    "solution can be converted to a proper solution by shifting one of the effective potentials , say @xmath53 , by a constant , employing the ambiguity in definition of potentials .",
    "this transformation will not affect the densities , but will change the relative position of the @xmath54 and @xmath19 ks energy levels .",
    "however , such a shift is analogous , in a known sense , to applying a uniform magnetic field on the system . we confine ourselves in the current work to zero magnetic field , which makes us distinguish b.s.proper solutions from fully proper ones .    in the current work",
    "the physical quantities obtained in dft calculations are the partial densities @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 and the total energy @xmath9 . the ionization energy @xmath55 and the spin @xmath8 ( see eq .  ( [ s.def ] ) ) are derived from those quantities .",
    "here @xmath9 is the total energy of an atom and @xmath56 is that of the corresponding ion .",
    "these are opposed to quantities like @xmath57 , @xmath41 , @xmath58 and @xmath39 , which belong to the ks system and do not receive here a direct physical interpretation .",
    "note , however , that although @xmath39 belong to the latter , the sums @xmath59 have an interpretation , being equal to @xmath3 and @xmath60 , correspondingly .",
    "as in earlier studies of atomic systems  @xcite , in the current work the density was approximated by its spherical average @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath1 is spherical as well , the effective potentials are spherical , too .",
    "this approximation reduces a three - dimensional problem to a one - dimensional problem . with a spherical potential ,",
    "the wave functions take the form @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are the spherical harmonics and @xmath64 are radial wave functions that obey the following differential equation : @xmath65 since the energy levels do not depend on @xmath66 , @xmath67 .    to determine the occupation numbers @xmath68 , the algorithm aevra presented in ref .",
    "@xcite was used . in this algorithm ,",
    "we start with a reasonable guess for @xmath69 and occupy the energy levels of the reference systems properly , given the total spin value @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we are assured that the density generated by the reference system obeys the known mathematical restrictions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec.theory ] ) .",
    "this allows us to calculate the effective potential from this density .",
    "if we employ this potential directly to calculate a new density in evr cases , then as predicted in  @xcite , the process starts alternating between two electronic configurations , and no convergence takes place .    instead , as the first step , we reduce the linear mixing coefficient for the effective potential each time the electronic configuration changes . by repeating this procedure ,",
    "it is possible to find a @xmath22 , with energy levels that coincide to any required accuracy @xmath70 , thus ensuring we enter the domain of ni - evr densities .",
    "however , this solution is not necessarily self - consistent , and additional iterations in the domain of ni - evr densities are required to obtain the final result .",
    "the second step in the algorithm continues the search in the subspace of potentials that generate ni - evr densities while relaxing the constraint on integer occupation .",
    "once an effective potential with two degenerate levels is found , it can produce a range of proper ni - evr densities by fractionally occupying the degenerate levels .",
    "we choose the occupations in a way that preserves the degeneracy of the energy levels for the next iteration  @xcite , but without constraining their values .    in principle",
    ", the described process has to be performed separately for all values of the total spin @xmath8 , finally choosing the one with the lowest energy . in practice , however , very high values of @xmath8 are not expected to minimize the energy of the system , if they produce a bound state at all .",
    "therefore , in the current work , for atoms and ions within the @xmath71-block only spins obtained by all possible occupations of the highest @xmath72 and @xmath73 levels were considered ; for @xmath74-block systems - only spins obtained by occupying the highest @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 levels , and for the @xmath79-block - by occupying @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 levels .    in all calculations , a high convergence of @xmath82 for the total energy was obtained . for cases with a degenerate ground state of the reference system ,",
    "the degenerate energy levels were kept within @xmath83 of each other , and thus fractional occupation numbers have an estimated precision of @xmath84 . to assure the desired accuracy in energy , eq .",
    "( [ schr.radial.eq ] ) was solved on a logarithmic grid with 16,000 points , on the interval @xmath85 in bohr radii , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the lsda and @xmath88 for the gga .",
    "in the course of the current work the total and ionization energies , the spin and the ks electronic configurations for atoms and first ions with @xmath89 were obtained within the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite .",

    "for the lanthanide ions with @xmath154 , the calculated spin was systematically lower than the experimental one by one unit .    in sec .",
    "[ res.gga ] an analysis of how pbe - gga affects the results for atomic systems was presented .",
    "it was found that although the pbe - gga slightly improves ionization energies of atoms , it fails to repair the main shortcomings of the lsda .",

    "[ res.compare.prmtrz ] results obtained using each of the three parametrizations of the correlation energy - vwn  @xcite , pz  @xcite and pw92  @xcite , both within the lsda and the gga , were compared .",
    "the discrepancy in the ionization energies obtained with different parametrizations was found to be small , of the order of @xmath146 .",
    "this discrepancy provides an error estimate of the parametrization process , and as a result , a lower bound for the error of the whole calculational scheme .",
    "the spin of atoms and ions was almost insensitive to the choice of the parametrization .",
    "several reasons can be given for the observed discrepancies in the ionization energies and spins of atoms and ions .",
    "first , relativistic effects , which could not be reproduced in the current treatment , are relevant for heavy atoms . for example , the dip in the ionization energy that is typical for the 4@xmath155 atom in each of the first four rows of the @xmath71-block ( see fig .  [ res.overview.ivsz ] ) , occurs for the 3@xmath156 , rather than the 4@xmath155 , atom ( bi , @xmath157 ) in the fifth row .",
    "this can be explained considering the @xmath158-@xmath158 coupling in heavy atoms , which can not be reproduced in non - relativistic calculations .",
    "furthermore , in the third row of the @xmath74-block the calculated @xmath103 presents sharp increases for @xmath159 and a drop for @xmath160 , which can be related to filling the @xmath74-orbital at @xmath121 and then the @xmath108-orbital at @xmath161 .",
    "relevant for the second row of transition metals , this behavior is not observed experimentally in the third row , suggesting it has to be treated relativistically , similarly to the fifth row in the @xmath71-block .",
    "it can be also observed that the calculation provides the same spin values for the corresponding atoms and ions from the second and third rows of the @xmath74-block . in the second row",
    "the correspondence with the experiment is high , which is not the case in the third row .",
    "it is probable that the relativistic effects in the third - row atoms are strong enough to dictate a different spin value .",
    "second , the spherical approximation to the density employed in the current calculations can affect the results in the @xmath71-,@xmath74- and @xmath79-blocks .",
    "without such an approximation , eigenenergies @xmath162 and eigenfunctions @xmath163 with different axial numbers @xmath164 would become distinct",
    ". the manifolds of these states may then overlap , which will affect the occupation of the levels and also the density @xmath165 . in particular , systems that in the spherical approximation are ni - evr , may become ni - psvr .",
    "in addition , the angular momentum @xmath166 of the atom can be obtained and compared to the experiment .",
    "furthermore , in cases where the gap between the occupied and the unoccupied orbitals with opposite spins is small , the spread between orbitals with different @xmath66-numbers can cause a change in the spin of the atom .",
    "this can possibly correct the prediction of the spin values for some @xmath74- and @xmath79-systems .",
    "however , early studies  @xcite suggests that a non - spherical treatment with local xc - functionals will only slightly affect the physical results .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that calculations beyond the spherical approximation would require much better approximations to the exchange - correlation functionals ",
    "the so - called orbital - dependent functionals  @xcite , but at present they are computationally more expensive  @xcite and beyond the scope of the present report .",
    "moreover , while the exact exchange potential only is available , an accompanying correlation potential is still under development .",
    "third , the local or semi - local nature of the xc - energy employed may lead to additional inaccuracies .",
    "one of the manifestations of ( semi-)locality is the spurious interaction between an electron and itself , which can influence the results all over the periodic table .    in particular , the incorrectly predicted spin for the lanthanide ions , as well as the fact that ni - evr solutions occur in lanthanides frequently , raise the suspicion that the @xmath113 level is obtained with a too high eigenenergy with respect to the @xmath128 levels , probably due to the self - interaction of electrons .    to investigate this hypothesis ,",
    "numerical checks have been performed on selected lanthanides . to lower the eigenenergy @xmath167 artificially ,",
    "the nuclear charge was raised from @xmath125 to @xmath168 .",
    "the value of @xmath169 was chosen to be the lowest possible to separate the degenerate @xmath111 and @xmath113 energy levels , both in the atoms and in the corresponding ions , and thus produce ni - psvr results . in pm , nd and sm ( @xmath170 ) , @xmath169 was @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "the ionization energies obtained are @xmath172 and @xmath173 , correspondingly , which are considerably higher than the original results , and thus closer to the experimental values .",
    "however , the spins of these atoms are now obtained incorrectly , all larger by one unit with respect to the experiment .",
    "the reason is that the formerly occupied @xmath174 level becomes unoccupied due to the increase in @xmath125 .",
    "furthermore , a similar check for tm ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) raised the ionization energy to @xmath177 , but did not affect the spin of its ion , which was obtained incorrectly .",
    "these tests have only a qualitative character , showing that proper treatment of the self - interaction of electrons might improve the results for @xmath103 in lanthanides , but improvement in @xmath8 is not assured .",
    "in addition , the question of how stable is a calculated spin value for a given atom / ion with respect to small variations of the xc - approximation can be addressed using the current database .",
    "to do so , we define a criterion of stability @xmath178 as the difference between the ground - state energy @xmath179 with the nominal spin @xmath8 , and the ground - state energy of the same system given it has the spin @xmath180 , which is the closest to @xmath179 .",
    "@xmath181 is an estimate of the magnitude of variation in the total energy differences required to change the spin of the system .",
    "examining the @xmath74- and @xmath79-blocks , it was found that for open - shell atoms @xmath181 can reach values of @xmath182 for e.g.  cr@xmath99 , tm , mo@xmath99 , ni@xmath99 , as well as values of @xmath183 and lower for fe@xmath99 , gd@xmath99 and re@xmath99 .",
    "no correlation was found , however , between systems with a low @xmath181 and an incorrect prediction of the spin or a high relative error in the ionization energy .",
    "for some atoms with an incorrect spin the result is very stable , e.g.  @xmath184 for pt and @xmath185 for v. therefore , the mismatches in spin in these atoms are probably not subject to nuances of the gga or the parametrization of the correlation energy , but must be corrected with a rather different approximation to the xc - energy .    to conclude",
    ", we have calculated the energies and spins of atoms and ions within the local spin - density approximation and the semi - local gga .",
    "we find that moving from a local to a semi - local approximation to the xc - energy does not improve significantly the description of atomic systems in dft .",
    "in particular , the spins of some transition and lanthanide elements are obtained incorrectly .",
