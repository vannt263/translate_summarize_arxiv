    "early results from rhic has established the creation of the strongly interaction partonic matter in central au+au collisions .",
    "the current focus of the community is to characterize its dynamical properties .",
    "one of the most useful tools at our disposal is the hard - scattered jets and di - jets .",
    "these ( di-)jets are created early in the collision and can subsequently probe the space - time evolution the qgp via the jet - medium interactions .",
    "both the single- and away - side di - hadron yield at high @xmath0 are strongly suppressed , consistent with jet quenching picture , where jets traversing the medium suffer significant energy loss or even totally absorbed by the medium .",
    "the strong suppression implies that the center of the medium is extremely opaque .",
    "this and the steeply falling parton spectra effectively lead to a bias on the energy loss , where the observed high @xmath0 single hadrons and dihadron pairs mainly come from those ( di)jets that suffer minimal interaction with the medium .",
    "in fact , dihadron data at @xmath1 gev/@xmath2  @xcite reveal characteristic jet - like peaks for the near - side ( @xmath3 ) and the away - side ( @xmath4 ) , consistent with fragmentation of almost unmodified jets .    because the observed jets suffers small energy loss , their usefulness as a tomography tool is limited .",
    "the information about jet - medium interaction are mostly derived indirectly from the suppression factors such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these factors basically represent the survival probabilities , and they are not very sensitive to the details of energy loss mechanisms in the high @xmath0 region ) .",
    "the situation , however , can be somewhat improved if we combine both single- and dihadron measurements and consider @xmath5 and @xmath6 simultaneously .    to first order , the suppression of the single hadron yield can be described by either a downward shift ( absorption )  @xcite or left shift ( energy loss with a fixed fraction )  @xcite",
    ". a more general form can contain both contributions , @xmath7 + ( 1-a)\\delta(\\delta e - e_0)\\ ] ] if we only consider the downward shift , a simple calculation show that @xmath8 , simply because there is more matter to transverse for away - side jet of the survived jets than for single jets . since experimental data suggests that @xmath9 , clearly downward - shift only is not sufficient .",
    "on the other hand , the suppression caused by left - shift term depends on both the energy loss itself as well as on the input parton spectra shape . the expected binary scaled p+p single hadron yield ( in @xmath10 )",
    "has a power - law shape with a power of 8  @xcite ; the away side spectra associated with the leading hadron , however , is much flatter with a power of 4.8  @xcite . for the same amount of",
    "left shift , we expect @xmath11 .",
    "following the prescription in ref  @xcite , the fractional energy loss @xmath12 is related to the suppression factor as @xmath13 .",
    "so if we require @xmath14 , then the away hadron energy loss fraction would be @xmath15 , much bigger than the single hadron energy loss fraction @xmath16 , as expected ( about 50% more energy loss ) .",
    "simple energy conservation arguments suggest that the energy of the quenched jets should be transported to intermediate and low @xmath0 single hadrons or hadron pairs .",
    "the shape and yield of such `` jet - induced '' contribution could be sensitive to the properties of the medium , such as the opacity , transport coefficient , speed of sound , etc .",
    "many studies show strong modifications of the near- and the away - side @xmath17 distributions in this @xmath0 region .",
    "[ fig : shape ] shows a representative subset of the per - trigger yield distributions arranged by increasing pair transverse momentum from  @xcite . at low @xmath0 , the near - side jet - induced pairs peak at @xmath3 , but",
    "the peak is broadened and enhanced with respect to @xmath18 collisions ; the away - side jet - induced pairs peaks at @xmath19  @xcite with a local minimum at @xmath4 .",
    "going from low to high @xmath0 , the away - side evolves from a broad , roughly flat away - side peak to a local minimum at @xmath4 . at high",
    "@xmath0 , jet shape for au+au gradually becomes peaked as for @xmath18 , albeit suppressed .",
    "these modification patterns reflect characteristics of the energy transport of the quenched partons in both and @xmath17 .",
    "the 17.2 gev data is from ceres and is carried out in @xmath20 in the cm frame at @xmath21 gev  @xcite .",
    "its pseudo - rapidity widow of 0.6 is close to 0.7 for phenix , thus the corresponding jet yield can be compared with phenix results after applying an upward correction of 0.7/0.6 = 1.17 .",
    "the maximum of sr in ceres is about half that of the phenix value , whereas the yield at the hr is surprisingly close to the phenix value .",
    "the former might suggest a weaker medium effect at lower energy , while the latter could be a combined result of a lower jet multiplicity and a weaker jet quenching at sps .",
    "further detailed study of the energy dependence of the punch - through and the medium - induced components can elucidate the onset of jet quenching and medium response .",
    "many mechanisms for this energy transport have been proposed for the near - side  @xcite and away - side  @xcite .",
    "most of these models are quite qualitative in nature .",
    "they typically focus on either jet shape or jet yield , near - side or away - side , high @xmath0 or low @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that both near- and away - side distributions are enhanced and broadened at low @xmath0 and that the modifications limited to @xmath22 gev/@xmath2 , above which the jet characteristics qualitatively approach jet fragmentation , may suggest that the modifications mechanisms for the near- and away - side are related . a model framework including both jet quenching and medium response , which can describe the full @xmath23 evolution of the jet shape and yield at both near- and away - side is required to understand the parton - medium interactions .",
    "our data provide valuable guidance for such future model development .",
