    "we show that the interference effects associated with off - diagonal matrix elements of the self - energy can significantly influence transport properties of the system for parallel and intermediate geometries .",

    "the elements of the reduced density matrix are defined as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the eigenstates of the dqd system .",

    "the self - energies in respective order of expansion can be calculated using the diagrammatic rules .",
    "@xcite    in our considerations we take into account the limit of weak tunnel coupling between the dots .",
    "for serial geometry of the double dot system , tunneling between the two dots becomes then a bottle - neck for transport and may considerably alter the spin - dependent transport characteristics of the system , as presented in the next section .",
    "this is contrary to previous theoretical studies of spin - dependent transport in dqds ,  @xcite where the hopping between the two dots was relatively large and transport took place through highly hybridized molecular - like states of the system .",

    "furthermore , we assume @xmath84 .",
    "the current is then mediated mainly by first - order ( sequential ) tunneling processes , while the higher - order coherent tunneling events play a minor role , and it is justifiable to neglect them .",
    "@xcite we thus investigate the basic transport properties using the sequential tunneling approximation , i.e. we need to determine only the lowest - order self - energies which involve one tunneling line .",
    "some examples of first - order diagrams relevant for the present calculation are shown in the appendix .",
    "after calculating the density matrix elements from eq .",
    "( [ eq : probability ] ) , one can determine the sequential current flowing through the double dot system from the following formula @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the first - order self - energy in which one vertex was substituted by a vertex representing the current operator , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",
    "in our analysis we assume that the intra - dot charging energy @xmath89 is relatively large for both dots , much larger than the interdot coulomb correlation energy @xmath20 .",
    "thus , only the zero , one and two - particle dqd states are relevant for transport .",
    "furthermore , in the case of @xmath90 , the occupation probability of the states with two electrons in the same dot is also vanishingly small .",
    "however , these states are taken into account as intermediate ( virtual ) states in the calculation , providing a natural high - energy cutoff .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that by using the real - time diagrammatic technique we are able to take into account the first - order virtual tunneling processes between the two dots in a fully systematic way .",
    "in this section we present and discuss numerical results on the charge current , differential conductance and tunnel magnetoresistance of double quantum dots coupled in serial , parallel , and intermediate geometries .",

    "[ fig:2](a ) . for the assumed parameters ,",
    "the dqd is empty at low bias and the current is blocked below the threshold voltage , irrespective of magnetic configuration of the system . in the blockade regime , however , the first - order processes can still contribute to the current due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , in the case of @xmath84 , as considered in this paper , the contribution from first - order processes can still be larger than that from second - order tunneling ( cotunneling ) .",
    "nevertheless , one must bear in mind that in the case of _ deep _ coulomb blockade , for instance for @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the second - order processes become dominant and must be taken into account to properly describe transport properties of the system .",
    "@xcite in this paper , however , we restrict ourselves to the case when transport is mainly governed by sequential tunneling processes .",
    "when the bias voltage approaches the threshold voltage , the sequential current starts to flow due to one - by - one electron tunneling through singly - occupied dqd states .",
    "this leads to the peak in the differential conductance , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) . however , when the bias voltage increases further , instead of a plateau one observes a drop of the current , which leads to negative differential conductance .",
    "this feature appears in both magnetic configurations , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) . when @xmath119 approaches @xmath120 , where another electron has possibility to tunnel into the dqd system , the current starts increasing further .",
    "physical mechanism responsible for the occurrence of negative differential conductance follows from the level renormalization due to tunneling processes between the dots and leads .",
    "this renormalization is directly related to the real part of the off - diagonal self - energies , see eq .",
    "( [ diagram2 ] ) ( and also ref .",

    "this renormalization lifts the initially assumed degeneracy of the two dot s levels . the larger separation between these renormalized levels , the smaller probability of electron tunneling from the left to the right dot",
    "we have calculated this separation as a function of the bias voltage ( not shown ) and found that the separation increases with increasing bias voltage ( in the voltage range where negative differential conductance appears ) , and therefore the current decreases with increasing bias . after reaching maximum ,",
    "the level separation starts to decrease with a further increase in voltage and negative differential conductance disappears .",
    "it is also worth noting that , due to the coupling to ferromagnetic leads , the level renormalization becomes spin dependent and , consequently , depends on magnetic configuration of the system , and so does the level spacing .",
    "the above described level renormalization makes the occupation probability of the left dot ( qd1 ) for @xmath125 larger than the occupation probability of the right dot ( qd2 ) , @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , the rate for tunneling between the two dots decreases with increasing the bias voltage .",
    "more specifically , @xmath128 decreases , whereas @xmath129 increases , @xmath130 . in the case of tunneling through double quantum dots connected in series ,",
    "the imaginary parts of the density matrix , e.g. @xmath131 and @xmath132 , are related to the charge transfer through the system , i.e. they are directly related to the current flow .",
    "@xcite consequently , the tunneling of electrons from the left lead to the left quantum dot ( qd1 ) is partially suppressed because of @xmath126 and due to decreased tunneling rates between the two dots with increasing bias voltage @xmath133 in the range @xmath134 .",
    "the tunnel magnetoresistance as a function of applied bias voltage is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) .",
    "since the conductance is larger in the parallel configuration than in the antiparallel one , the corresponding tmr is positive , although very small in the voltage range where double occupancy is allowed .",
    "moreover , one can note that the sequential tunneling tmr is generally smaller than the julliere s value of tmr , @xcite @xmath135 for @xmath102 , which is characteristic of single tunnel junction or fully coherent transport .",
    "@xcite in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) , the tmr reaches local maxima for @xmath136 and for @xmath137 , but it is especially enhanced at the first coulomb step , i.e. in the vicinity of @xmath136 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we present results obtained for dqd connected in series with average double dot level position being negative @xmath138 .",
    "the dqd system is then singly occupied in equilibrium , and the system is in the coulomb blockade regime as double occupation of dqd would cost the correlation energy @xmath20 .",
    "since the levels corresponding to @xmath139 and @xmath140 start contributing to current at the same bias ( @xmath139 and @xmath140 are symmetric with respect to the zero bias voltage ) , only one step is observed in the bias dependence of current .",

    "more specifically , negative tmr follows from the level renormalization due to coupling of the dots to external leads in the presence of inter - dot coulomb correlations .",
    "this level renormalization is spin dependent , so that it lifts spin degeneracy of the dot levels .",
    "more importantly , it is generally different for each dot and therefore modifies the renormalized level spacing @xmath142 .",
    "the renormalization of the level spacing in the system under consideration is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . for the assumed parameters hopping between the dots is like a _ bottle neck _ for electrons , that controls current flowing through the system .",

    "thus , in the parallel configuration the spin - down channel , which involves spin - minority bands in both leads , takes over control of the current , while the dominant spin channel in the antiparallel configuration involves one spin - majority and one spin - minority bands .",
    "consequently , the current is then larger in the antiparallel configuration than in the parallel one , which results in negative tmr .    to support this ,",

    "furthermore , for the intermediate geometry , the tmr for larger bias voltages is quite significant , contrary to the case of serial geometry , see figs .",

    "[ fig:7 ] . ]    for completeness , in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we show the bias and gate voltage dependence of the tmr .",
    "one can see that tmr displays well defined structures consisting of regions where it is roughly constant . in these transport regions",
    "the corresponding current - voltage curves display plateaus , whereas at resonances the corresponding tmr changes considerably .",
    "it is interesting to analyze how tmr depends on the asymmetry factor @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we present the bias dependence of tmr calculated for different values of @xmath38 and for the case when off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath158 are zero ( @xmath159 ) and finite ( @xmath146 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig:9](a ) and ( b ) , respectively . by changing @xmath38 from @xmath160 to @xmath161 , geometry of",
    "the system continuously changes from serial to parallel one .",
    "furthermore , with increasing @xmath38 also the magnitude of the off - diagonal matrix elements is increased , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coupling_left ] ) and ( [ eq : coupling_right ] ) .",
    "first of all , one can note that tmr generally increases with increasing @xmath38 .",
    "this is associated with the fact that for @xmath162 the electrons can tunnel between the leads through just a single dot .",
    "accordingly , the role of interdot hopping , which is independent of electron spin and therefore reduces tmr , is diminished and tmr increases . in particular , when crossing over from the serial to parallel geometry , the tmr at zero bias increases , while sharp maxima in tmr at resonance voltages are transformed into plateaus .",
    "this behavior can be observed in the case of @xmath159 and @xmath146 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:9](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "there are however some differences between these two situations .",
    "the virtual tunneling processes between the two dots , described by the nonzero parameter @xmath152 , decrease the tmr at the zero bias and increase it for large bias voltages , @xmath163 , as compared to the case of @xmath159 .",

    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . ]",
    "another interesting feature visible in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] is that tmr for @xmath41 at the side plateaus , i.e. for @xmath165 , has the same magnitude for both @xmath159 and @xmath146 cases .",
    "this can be clearly shown by deriving an approximate analytical formula for tmr in this voltage region . at very low temperatures",
    "one can approximate the fermi functions by step functions and assume that the electrons tunnel only from one side to the other .",
    "@xcite then , one can show that the tmr for @xmath41 and @xmath165 is given by @xmath166 which is exact at zero temperature . from the above formula",
    "follows that tmr in the bias regime under consideration is independent of the magnitude of the off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "this is , however , not true for the current , which for @xmath41 is given by @xmath167 in the parallel and @xmath168 in the antiparallel magnetic configurations .",
    "( color online ) ( a ) tunnel magnetoresistance as a function of the bias voltage and parameter @xmath152 , calculated for for @xmath149 .",
    "( b ) cross - sections of tmr for several values of @xmath152 as indicated in the figure .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . ]",
    "the interference effects due to virtual first - order processes between the two dots can significantly affect tmr , especially for larger values of @xmath152 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , which depicts tmr as a function of the bias voltage and parameter @xmath152 , together with various cross - sections .",
    "it can be seen that with increasing the magnitude of the off - diagonal matrix elements , the tmr generally increases in the low bias voltage regime , @xmath169 , and for larger voltages , @xmath163 , although the latter dependence is not monotonic .",
    "however , for bias voltages where transport occurs through charge states with single electron on the double dot , @xmath165 , tmr becomes suppressed with raising @xmath152 , and for @xmath170 we find a negative tmr effect .",
    "the negative tmr develops approximately at the resonance , @xmath171 , where two - particle states of the double dot system start taking part in transport .",
    "( color online ) bias voltage dependence of tmr calculated for @xmath170 and for different values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath38 , as indicated in the figure .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:10 ] was calculated for @xmath149 .",
    "however , it turns our that the spin - dependent transport properties may also strongly depend on the geometry of the system .",
    "this is especially visible in tmr for maximum value of the parameter @xmath152 , @xmath170 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] we plot tmr as a function of the bias voltage for different values of @xmath38 and for @xmath170 .",
    "as one can note , tmr is rather independent of @xmath38 at low bias voltages , while for larger bias , @xmath163 , tmr generally increases with raising @xmath38 .",
    "this is however not the case for @xmath165 , where tmr strongly depends on the geometry of the system . with crossing over from serial to parallel geometry",
    ", the magnitude of negative tmr is increased and additional maximum develops next to the resonance , @xmath171 , which transforms into plateau for @xmath38 close to 1 .",
    "interestingly , it can be also seen that tunnel magnetoresistance is very sensitive to slight changes in the asymmetry parameter @xmath38 , when the latter is close to unity . to understand this behavior one needs to realize that the bare states of the two quantum dots coupled directly ( by the hopping term ) or indirectly ( due to off - diagonal coupling matrix elements ) hybridize in molecular - like states . as a result ,",
    "the bonding and anti - bonding states emerge , the widths of which strongly depend on the dot - lead coupling strengths and geometry of the system . in the case",
    "considered here , the relative width of the bonding and anti - bonding states varies with the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "when the difference in the coupling of a given electrode to the two dots is reduced , the width of the bonding state increases whereas that of the anti - bonding state decreases . in particular , in the limit of @xmath41 , the anti - bonding state becomes totally decoupled from the leads , while the bonding state acquires width of the order of @xmath172 . in this limit the above mentioned features of the tmr disappear and tunnel magnetoresistance is constant for @xmath165 . in other words ,",
    "the high sensitivity of the tmr with respect to the system s geometry is associated with the fact that the interference conditions for electron waves transmitted through the two dots become modified when changing @xmath38 .",
    "we have analyzed the spin - polarized transport properties of double quantum dots weakly coupled to each other and to external leads . using the real - time diagrammatic technique we have calculated the conductance and tunnel magnetoresistance in the parallel , serial and intermediate geometries of double quantum dots .",
    "moreover , we have taken into account the effects of virtual tunneling processes between the two dots taking place through the states in the leads .",
    "such processes are absent in serial geometry and become maximum for parallel geometry .    in the case of double quantum dots coupled in series",
    "we have found a negative tunnel magnetoresistance at the resonance and negative differential conductance for transport voltages where single - particle double - dot states take part in transport . on the other hand , for parallel geometry of the system ,",
    "both the negative tmr and negative differential conductance vanish .",
    "the above effects may be restored in an intermediate geometry and strongly depend on the magnitude of the virtual processes between the two dots .",
    "furthermore , in the case when virtual processes are maximal , we have found a strong dependence of the tmr on the geometry of the system , especially for geometries very close to the parallel one .",
