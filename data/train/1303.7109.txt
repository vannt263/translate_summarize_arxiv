    "the crab nebula is one of the most famous pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) which is located in the center of a historical supernova first recorded in japan and china in 1054 @xcite .",
    "an energetic , bright pulsar  ( known as crab pulsar = psr  b0531 + 21 ) exists in the center of the crab nebula .",
    "the crab nebula has been observed in the entire observable electromagnetic wavelength from radio to tev gamma - rays . from the non - thermal spectrum and strong polarization  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "emissions from the object are interpreted as synchrotron radiation in the x - ray band .",
    "emissions from the direction of the object are divided into pwn and pulsar components .",
    "these two components can be separated not only by imaging analyses but also by phase - resolved timing analyses if we assume the emission from the pulsar is almost the same as the pulsed emission .",
    "therefore , they are separately observed and discussed by many authors even in the hard x - ray band , where it is hard to get images .",
    "the flux of the pulsar component accounts for @xmath120% of the total flux with most of the rest stemming from the pwn in the hard x - ray band .",
    "the pulsar essentially drives the electromagnetic radiation as follows : energetic flows of electrons and positrons from the pulsar ( pulsar winds ) reach and interact with interstellar mediums to induce a termination shock .",
    "the high energy particles are believed to radiate synchrotron emission outside of the shock .",
    "this radiation is called as pwne .",
    "since the origins of the emissions of pulsars and pwne are the rotation of magnetosphere of the neutron star , they had been believed to be stable in principle .",
    "data stored in @xmath112 years recently indicated 10 percent flux variation in 10  300  kev with hard x - ray instruments @xcite . as reported by @xcite , the pulsed flux of the crab pulsar in the 2  100 kev band slightly decreased by 0.2% yr@xmath2 , which is negligible for hard x - ray variation .",
    "therefore the variation seen in the crab observations is supposed to be due to that of the flux of pwn . currently , there are no reasonable models to account for the variation of the flux of pwn .",
    "@xcite also suggest the softening phenomena in the light curves of @xmath0 100  kev with fermi / gbm and integral / isgri .",
    "as indicated by @xcite and @xcite , the x - ray spectrum from the crab nebula is described by the broken power - law model , whose break energy is at about 100 kev .",
    "this break can be explained by electron cooling via synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus the break point and the index may be changed in accordance to the flux change .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported variable broken power - law spectra with cgro / batse , while @xcite could not confirm the phenomenon .",
    "thus , the existence of the variation in the broken power law spectrum was unclear .",
    "here we analyzed the archival data of the crab nebula obtained by the suzaku hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) , which offers the best sensitivity in the range of 10  600  kev .",
    "since the promising variability could be so small compared with the systematic errors in the standard calibration of the instruments , in principle , we have to clarify the validity of the energy response matrix including the effective area before the spectral analyses .",
    "this paper reports on spectral variations with close attention paid to instrumental calibration , and is organized as follows : section  [ sec : observation ] discusses the observations and the method of data reduction employed .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] describes the results obtained . in section  [ sec : hardness ] , we first examined the spectral changes without model fittings in order to reduce possible errors from the uncertainty of the response matrices and the method of model fittings .",
    "then in sections [ sec : indv_spec ] to [ sec : quant ] , we performed model fittings to the spectra in order to quantitate the spectral changes .",
    "section  [ sec : pulsed ] describes the analysis and results regarding the pulsar component .",
    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] discusses the origin of the observed variability .",
    "we used data observed by the pin ( 10  70  kev ) and gso ( gd@xmath3sio@xmath4(ce ) ; 40  600  kev ) of the hxd ( @xcite ; @xcite ) on board suzaku  @xcite .",
    "the hxd has two advantages in investigating hard x - ray spectral variability : wide - band sensitivity in 10  600  kev , and small background rate and high reproducibility ( i.e. , smaller systematic errors ) of the background model .",
    "suzaku also carries ccds called the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) .",
    "however these devices are difficult to use for this study due to a pileup problem when observing the bright object like the crab nebula .",
    "for this reason , we did not use the xis data in this work .",
    "there are two typical observation attitudes for suzaku corresponding to the optical axes of the xis and hxd ( respectively called `` xis nominal '' and `` hxd nominal '' ) .",
    "suzaku observed the crab nebula with both nominal positions to check the effective areas and energy responses .",
    "observations for this purpose were made 17 times from july 2005 to march 2012 , and all data were public soon after the observations . in order to avoid relative large uncertainty in calibration",
    ", we excluded the datasets other than nominal pointing positions ; i.e. , offset observations of the crab nebula , which is used to define the optical axes at the initial phase of the satellite .",
    "the effective area of the hxd is different by the nominal positions simply due to the transparency of its fine collimator . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the ratio between effective areas of the hxd and xis nominal positions is about 92% , and the differences in energy dependencies of the effective area between them is within 1% in 15  70  kev and 2% in 50 ",
    "600  kev .",
    "every response matrix is defined for a period , `` epoch '' , which is divided by the change of operational parameters ; combination of a bias voltage and a set of lower discriminator ( ld ) level .",
    "table 3 of @xcite summarizes the history of these operations .",
    "the gain changes of the pin are within 1% @xcite .",
    "we also confirmed the pin gain stability with accuracy of @xmath0 0.7% until 2012 september after the study by nishino et al ( 2010 ) , by measuring the gd k lines produced in gso crystals which are irradiated by x - rays from objects  @xcite .",
    "the gain of the photomultipliers for gso changes in various timescales , so that the gso gain history files are constantly revised along with calibration results .",
    "the energy scale in @xmath0 100  kev was also improved by the ftools ` hxdpi ` @xcite . all hxd data were reprocessed with ` aepipeline ` version  1.0.1 in the headas 6.11 software package using caldb 2011 - 09 - 15 ; therefore , the gso data were applied to ` hxdpi ` version 2010 - 01 - 12 and the gain history ` gsogpt ` in this work .",
    "background for the hxd data is generated as a synthetic model that accounts for the time - variable particle background ( the `` non x - ray background '' , nxb ; @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , we used the `` tuned '' pin nxb models of version 2.0 ( ` method = lcfitdt , methodv=2.0pin0804 ` ) .",
    "we also used the gso nxb models of version 2.5 ( ` method = lcfit , methodv=2.5ver0912 - 64 ` ) for observations before november 2011 , and those of version 2.6 ( ` method = lcfit , methodv=2.6ver1110 - 64 ` ) after november 2011 .",
    "the uncertainty of the nxb models of the pin is within 3% @xcite , which is negligible as the crab source count rate is 10 times greater than that of nxb , even if at 70  kev .",
    "the uncertainty of the gso nxb is less than 1% @xcite .    in the estimation of the flux from the object ,",
    "it is important to calculate the dead time ( or live time ) of the observation .",
    "the dead time of the hxd - pin and gso is calculated regarding the following three processes : ( 1 )  event processing stopped by another process running previously triggered , ( 2 )  an event data packet discarded in communication between the hxd analog electronics and digital electronics , and ( 3 )  space packets containing events discarded due to limited bandpass between the digital electronics and data processor .",
    "in particular , the hxd team tunes the parameters of analog electronics , and so the case ( 2 ) only occurs just after south atlantic anomaly passages .",
    "also , we discard events during the periods in case ( 3 ) by the ftool , ` hxdgtigen ` .",
    "the dead time is calculated and stored with the pulse height data obtained by the ftool ` hxddtcor ` .",
    "the dead time fraction is determined with accuracy of @xmath0 0.2% at an observation duration of @xmath5 10  ks @xcite .",
    "in order to examine the time variation of total flux ( pulsar + nebula ) reducing effects by any systematic uncertainty of the instrumental responses , we evaluate the count rates of individual observations by subtracting both the non x - ray background and cosmic x - ray background from events .",
    "we also have to note that different bias volatages for pin were applied during epoch 1 , epoch 2 and after epoch 3 , as represented in table 3 of @xcite .",
    "effective areas for each epoch is calculated based on ground tests ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to compare the measured flux in each epoch",
    ", here we normalized the photon flux using the calculated effective area for each epoch .",
    "in addition to the effect of bias voltage , the effective area decreases at @xmath0 25  kev because of ld of each pin detector . besides , the detector s responses above 55  kev were affected by the degraded depth of depletion layers , which is adjusted by using the calibration data - sets on the crab nebula itself .",
    "therefore , we only used the 25  55 kev band where the effective area of the response matrices changes within 1% for observations after pin epoch 3 .",
    "responses of this energy band depend on neither signal processing nor time degradation , and are only defined simply by the physical process ; cross section of the photo absorption process , or a stopping power of si of the pin diode ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the count rates are normalized by the effective area calculated for each observation , taking into account the difference in effective area according to different nominal positions .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows the variation of total count rates with the hxd and other x - ray detectors normalized with the count rates in mjd 55000  55500 .",
    "the count rates in 25  55  kev and that in 50  100  kev are consistent with the year - scale trends by other satellites except for the data after mjd 55500 . on the other hand ,",
    "the trend of the gso data in 100  500  kev deviates from trends of the other energy bands even when the data include statistical errors ( @xmath6 ) and systematic errors ( 1% of the nxb ) .",
    "in addition to the year - scale changes , a day - scale variation of @xmath11% with the pin and gso is also represented , which is derived from a ratio between count rates of 2006.03.30 and 2006.04.04 whose configurations ( pin epochs and nominal positions ) are the same ( see table  [ table1 ] for the time intervals and count rates ) .",
    "to clarify the year - scale and day - scale variations ( section [ sec : flux ] ) without model fittings , we produced the hardness ratios of the pin and gso datasets",
    ". figure  [ figure2 ] shows the count rates vs. hardness ratios of the pin and gso .",
    "the count rates ( horizontal axes ) are normalized by the effective area calculated for each observation , taking into account for different nominal positions . to avoid mixing the data of different detectors ( i.e , different energy response matrices ) , here we plotted hardness ratios of the pin and gso individually .",
    "when observing such bright sources as the crab nebula , gd k lines ( @xmath143  kev ) from the gso had not been reproduced with sufficient accuracy in the response  @xcite .",
    "we did not use the energy range of 40  45 kev to avoid the gd k line structure .    in order to check correlations between hardness ratios and count rates , we fitted the data with linear functions , and then got @xmath7/d.o.f = 16.72/10 ( pin ) and 47.96/15 ( gso ) .",
    "hypotheses of linear correlations are rejected on 91.9% ( pin ) and @xmath5 99.9% ( gso ) confidence levels . in other words , both the hardness ratios and individual count rates vary significantly , but neither shows any unique correlation .",
    "moreover , the hardness ratios of the soft band and hard band behave differently , suggesting a variable break energy or photon indexes in spectra which they are described by the broken power law model , as indicated by @xcite .      the level of the observed variation ( @xmath1 6.3% ) of pin 25  55  kev count rates , as evaluated in section  [ sec : flux ] ,",
    "is fairly close to the sum of official values of the systematic errors of released response matrices ( gain stability ) , nxb , and dead time correction ( @xmath0 1.2% total at @xmath0 100  kev ; section  [ sec : data_reduction ] ) .",
    "here we summarize evidences showing that the above analysis is reliable .",
    "as the response matrices of the hxd - pin ( 25  55  kev ) and gso are constructed only in line with geant4 simulations with parameters obtained in ground tests @xcite , they have not been tuned or calibrated with the crab nebula .",
    "thus we reasonably consider the response matrices to be independent of the flux variation of the crab nebula .",
    "as mentioned in section 3.1 , the hxd flux trend was consistent with other satellites at 3@xmath81% ( pin 25",
    " 55  kev ) , 1@xmath81% ( gso 50 ",
    "100  kev ) , and 4@xmath81% ( gso 100  500  kev ) , taking into account day - scale variability as the second errors ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "these facts support the conclusions that effective areas of the pin 25  55  kev , gso 50  100  kev and 100",
    " 500  kev are essentially stable within 4% , 2% and 5% at most respectively , and that the relative flux variation is real .    before evaluating individual spectra , we first performed a model fitting of the averaged spectrum of all hxd observations in 25  40 , 45  55  kev as a template to evaluate spectral variations , using the averaged response matrix weighted by individual exposures .",
    "we used a single power - law model in order to see possible spectral break in comparison with the simple model .",
    "the values of the photon index and flux are 2.141 @xmath8 0.006 and 9.65@xmath9 erg @xmath10 s@xmath2 ( 25  55 kev ) at a 90% confidence level with the @xmath7/d.o.f .",

    "figure  [ figure3 ] shows the ratios of individual spectra to the averaged best - fit power - law model .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates the variations of the spectral break at @xmath1100  200  kev .",
    "for instance , the spectral slope was steep in the spectra of 2005.09.15 , 2008.08.27 , and 2012.03.14/26 , while flat in the spectra of 2007.03.20 and 2009  2010 .",

    "the timescale of the flux variation is expected to be a few days ( section  [ sec : flux ] ) . by adopting a timescale of five days , for example",
    ", we can estimate the value of @xmath54 to be @xmath11.7 mg from equation  [ eq : synch_b ] . because the cooling timescale can be regarded as the passage time scale , the typical scale of the variable emission region is estimated to be around 0.35",

    "although the scale of the variable region is @xmath1 0.1% of the whole x - ray emission region , the mismatch between the occupancy ( about 0.1% of the whole x - ray emitting region ) and the factor of the flux variations ( 8% of total flux ) can be solved when the variable region has @xmath1 10 times higher magnetic field strength than those in others , because @xmath63 as mentioned before .",
    "of course , because @xmath24 has a dependency with @xmath58 or @xmath59 , we may assume that a multiple component has a different density or lorentz factor , but we do not discuss these possibilities here due to limitation of information which we have currently .",
