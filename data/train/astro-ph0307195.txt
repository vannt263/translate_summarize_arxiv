    "the seyfert galaxy ngc  6814  became famous with the apparent discovery , made with the non - imaging _ exosat _  medium - energy experiment ( me ) , that its x - ray flux was modulated with a strict @xmath112,150 s period @xcite .",
    "however , this fame turned into notoriety when it was discovered , through imaging x - ray observations with _ rosat _  position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) , that this periodicity actually belonged to another x - ray source in the field of view , rx  j1940.1@xmath01025 , about 37@xmath2 away from ngc  6814   @xcite .",
    "the latter authors identified this new x - ray source with a v@xmath116 mag object , subsequently designated v1432  aquilae , and proposed that it was a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) system belonging to the polar sub - class ( also known as am her - type systems ) .",
    "a cv is a semi - detached binary in which the white dwarf primary accretes mass from a late - type ( usually an m dwarf ) secondary . in a polar",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) , the primary is strongly ( @xmath310 mgauss ) magnetic , which prevents the formation of an accretion disk .",
    "the accretion flow is channeled by the magnetic field towards the magnetic pole region(s ) , where a strong standing shock forms .",
    "the post - shock plasma cools by emitting optical / infrared cyclotron emission and optically thin thermal x - ray emission with a typical temperature of kt@xmath110 kev ( `` the hard component '' ) .",
    "the white dwarf surface is heated from above by these radiation , and probably directly by dense blobs whose shocks are buried within the white dwarf atmosphere , and emit optically thick , blackbody - like emission with a typical temperature of kt@xmath130 ev ( `` the soft component '' ) . in most polars , the soft x - ray component dominates over the hard , although in some the two are roughly comparable .    in polars ,",
    "the strong magnetic field of the primary usually synchronizes the white dwarf spin to the orbital period . in the other subclass of magnetic cvs , intermediate polars ( ips ) or dq her - type systems",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) , the spin period of the white dwarf ( p@xmath4 ) is significantly shorter than the orbital period ( p@xmath5 ) , many of them with p@xmath4  @xmath1 0.1 p@xmath5 . in ips , a weaker magnetic field or",
    "a greater orbital orbital separation is thought to prevent synchronism , and that their current p@xmath4  is close to their evolutionary equilibrium .",
    "v1432  aql  is among the minority of polars with a strong hard x - ray component .",
    "moreover , two almost identical periods have been found in this system @xcite .",
    "the orbital period is 12116.3 s , while the second period is @xmath10.3% longer at 12150 s , with a resulting beat period ( p@xmath6@xmath7 = p@xmath5@xmath7 @xmath0 p@xmath4@xmath7 ) of @xmath150 days .",
    "this makes v1432  aql  an asynchronous polar , in which p@xmath4  and p@xmath5  differ by @xmath11% , probably in a temporary departure from synchronism . in the first known example , v1500  cyg ( = nova cygni 1975 ) , the nova explosion is the almost certain cause of the asychronism . in an asynchronous polar , a strong ( @xmath8accretion torque )",
    "mhd torque should operate to synchronize the white dwarf spin on a short ( @xmath9evolutionary ) time scale , and indeed this is observed in v1500  cyg ( synchronization timescale @xmath1150 years ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to v1500  cyg , by  cam and cd  ind are also asynchronous with p@xmath4  being @xmath1 1% shorter than p@xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", v1432  aql  appears to be asynchronous in the other direction . @xcite",
    "questioned if this was possible , and also pointed out that such a system might be expected to synchronise much more quickly than v1500  cyg like systems : when p@xmath5  @xmath10 p@xmath4 , the synchronization must compete and overcome the accretion torque , whereas when p@xmath5  @xmath11 p@xmath4 , they cooperate .",
    "although @xcite showed that it was possible for a nova explosion to slow down the white dwarf spin , thus producing a v1432  aql - like system , the synchronization timescale of v1432  aql  that @xcite inferred is 100 yrs , comparable to that of v1500  cyg .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative model in which p@xmath4  is about 4040 s. a complex interaction of spin and orbital periodicity , and less than perfect observational sampling could explain the apparent presence of a 12150 s period .",
    "however , we now consider this model unlikely , given the confirmation of rapid timescale for synchronization (  4.1 ) .",
    "we will therefore refer to the 12150 s period as the spin period in the rest of this paper .",
    "there is a second controversy surrounding v1432  aql .",
    "the fiducial marker that defines the 12116.3 s orbital period is an eclipse - like event seen both in the optical and x - ray light curves .",
    "however , @xcite argued this to be a dip caused by the accretion stream , as seen in several well - observed polars @xcite .",
    "they based this conclusion partly on the light curve which is unusual for an eclipsing polar , but mainly on the residual x - ray flux observed with non - imaging _ ginga _  large area counter ( lac ) detector .",
    "the observed spectrum became harder during the eclipse , which suggested a photoelectric absorption event by the accretion stream .",
    "however , the presence and the regularity of the same feature at all energies strongly argues that this is a true eclipse by the secondary star @xcite . in this paper , we show that later x - ray observations are consistent with zero residual flux , thus strongly favoring the eclipse interpretation .",
    "we then go on to use the eclipse as a tool to explore the accretion geometry as a function of the beat phase .",
    "although not the origin of the @xmath12 s period , the seyfert galaxy ngc  6814  is by no means an uninteresting object . in the optical , it shows broad emission lines of only modest width ( @xmath13 kms@xmath7 ) ; both the continuum @xcite and the emission lines @xcite are highly variable , varying between seyfert 1 or seyfert 1.8 classifications .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "observations show that the x - ray flux of ngc  6814  is also variable , decreasing by a factor of at least 5 between october 1992 and october 1993 , and by a factor of 2 in @xmath1 6 hours @xcite .",
    "given the angular separation of @xmath14 between v1432  aql  and ngc  6814 , x - ray data with non - imaging , collimated instruments are often entangled ; the strong variability of ngc  6814  then leads to require particular care to be taken when observing v1432  aql  with such an instrument .",
    "therefore , although v1432  aql  is the primary focus of this work , we also present results on the x - ray behaviors of ngc  6814 , both as a necessary precondition for the study of the cv and as a worthy goal in itself .",
    "we describe the x - ray observations in  2 .",
    "we present the results and implication on ngc  6814  in  3 .",
    "the results on v1432  aql  ( including a short summary of continued optical photometry ) are presented in  4 , and discussed in  5 .",
    "a summary of conclusions is given in  6 .",
    "in addition to our own _ rxte",
    "_  campaign , we have analyzed archival observations with two x - ray observatories with imaging telescopes . all x - ray observations analyzed here were obtained during 1997 and 1998 .      v1432  aql  was observed on 8 occasions between 1997 april 2 and may 13 with _ bepposax _  @xcite .",
    "here we will focus on the data from medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) instruments @xcite .",
    "_ bepposax _  carried 3 identical units of mecs , but one had malfunctioned between the 7th and 8th observations of v1432  aql , so the last observation was made with only two operational mecs .",
    "each visit resulted in between 8 and 13 ksec of effective exposure with the mecs .",
    "details of the 8 observations are listed in table[obslogsa ] .",
    "although the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) can in principle provide information regarding the behavior of the source below 2 kev , the data quality is lower than the mecs because there is only one unit of lecs and it is operated only during orbital night .",
    "moreover , the latter means that lecs data sample a subset of the phase covered by mecs data .",
    "given the potential complications from cycle - to - cycle variability , we have opted not to include lecs data in our analysis .",
    "similarly , we have not included data from the two non - imaging narrow - field instruments on - board _ bepposax _ , the high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter and the phoswich detection system .",
    "we have extracted source counts from the mecs data using a circular extraction region with a radius of 3.6 arcmin , and background counts from an annular extraction region with outer and inner radii of 16.9 and 7.2 arcmin , respectively , assumed that the background was flat , and therefore scaled the latter by the ratio of areas of the extraction regions to derive the net source count rates .",
    "we have extracted light curves from pi channels 31100 ( @xmath11.54.5 kev ) and channels 101170 ( @xmath14.58.0 kev ) with a bin size of 16 s. roughly speaking , these two bands contain equal counts from v1432  aql , and when combined , result in the highest signal - to - noise .",
    "v1432  aql  was observed serendipitously with",
    "_ asca _  in 1997",
    "october during the observation of a high redshift quasar , pks  1937@xmath0101 ( see table[obslogsa ] for further details ) .",
    "although _ asca _  has 4 co - aligned telescopes @xcite",
    ", v1432  aql  was about 20 arcmin off - axis and was not in the field of view of the two solid - state imaging spectrometers .",
    "as for the two gas imaging spectrometers ( gis ) , the source was too close to the on - board radioactive calibration source in gis-3 for a useful analysis .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to the gis-2 data .",
    "we have extracted the source counts from an elliptical extraction region ( to match the overall shape of the off - axis point spread function ) with semi - major and semi - minor axes of 7.5 and 2.9 arcmin , respectively .",
    "background was taken from a large area of the detector with a similar off - axis angle as the source , which was then subtracted from the source data after scaling with the ratio of the detector areas .",
    "we have used two energy bands , pi channels 60169 ( 0.72 kev ) and 170847 ( 210 kev ) for the _ asca _  data .",
    "we have performed a series of 25 observations between 1998 may 18 and 1998 aug 21 , covering approximately two beat cycles of v1432  aql  with _ rxte _",
    "each observation covers a small range of orbital phase of v1432  aql , centered on the eclipse .",
    "here we concentrate on the data obtained with the proportional counter array ( pca ) @xcite .",
    "the angular separation of v1432  aql  and ngc  6814  of @xmath137 arcmin means that pca observations pointed at v1432  aql  have some sensitivity to the x - ray photons from ngc  6814 .",
    "we have therefore chosen to offset our pointing by @xmath115@xmath2 ( position `` c '' in table[obsposxte ] and in figure[map ] ) .",
    "we estimate that the pca collimater response is about 80% for v1432",
    "aql  and about 10% for ngc  6814  at position c. furthermore , we wished to monitor the x - ray flux level of ngc  6814  to assess the residual contamination , and for its own scientific merits .",
    "our intention was to similarly offset the pointing .",
    "however , due to a typographical error on our part , the actual pointings were performed at position a in table[obsposxte ] and in figure[map ] ( change the minute figures of ra to 43 and we would have achieved our original aim ; position a in figure[map ] ) .",
    "this greatly reduced the effectiveness of our campaign for ngc  6814  ( see , however , ",
    "each of the 25 observations was composed of a pointing at position c preceded by , followed by , or in two cases sandwiched between , a pointing at position a ( see figure[xteagn ] for a couple of examples ) .",
    "typically 2 ksec of good data were obtained at position c. the details of the _ rxte _",
    "observations are given in table[obslogxte ] . as is often the case ,",
    "not all of the five proportional counter units ( pcus ) were active in all observations : the active pcus are also indicated in the table .",
    "the collimator response at off - axis positions are a function of the roll angle , since the collimator geometry is hexagonal .",
    "we have estimated the actual efficiency achieved in each c pointing for v1432  aql  and for ngc  6814 , so that we can infer the on - axis count rates ( per second per pcu ) from the observed rates .",
    "we have estimated the background using faint source background model , using files pca_bkgd_faint240_e03v03.mdl and pca_bkgd_faintl7_e03v03.mdl as well as the south atlantic anomaly history file .",
    "this model is highly successful in reproducing the non - x - ray background experienced by the pca .",
    "however , it only models the average , high - latitude , cosmic x - ray background , which is not appropriate for this part of the sky .",
    "moreover , the model does not include the contamination by ngc  6814 .",
    "we have extracted data from the top layer of the pca , which gives the best signal - to - noise ratio . for the study of ngc  6814 , we use the entire energy band of the pca ( effectively 315 kev ) , while for the detailed study of the eclipses in v1432  aql , we restrict ourselves to channels 827 , or roughly 310 kev , which on average improves the signal - to - noise ratio . in both cases , we use count rate per pcu in our plots to account for the variable number of active pcus , and moreover convert this to the estimated on - axis rate for the appropriate target .",
    "we now use our _ rxte _  campaign as well as archival data to evaluate the x - ray fluxes of ngc  6814  in the 210 kev band .",
    "lower energy x - rays from ngc  6814  have been securely detected using imaging instruments and are known to be variable , starting with the _ einstein _",
    "imaging proportional counter ( ipc ) observation spanning two days , which showed this source to be variable on a timescale of 20,000 s @xcite . a long - term light curve obtained with _ exosat _",
    "low - energy experiment ( le ) is presented in figure 1 of @xcite ; and for _ rosat _  results , see @xcite . as @xcite noted , the _ exosat _  medium - energy experiment ( me ) data of `` ngc  6814 '' varied in a manner similar to that of the le data over the timescale of months ( their figure 1 ) .",
    "although we now know that the ( non - imaging ) me data were contaminated with x - rays from v1432  aql , as evidenced by the detection of the 12,000 s signal , the le ",
    "me correlation is a strong evidence that a significant fraction of the observed me counts did originate from ngc  6814 .    in our _ rxte _  campaign",
    ", we attempted to monitor the x - ray variability of ngc  6814  by obtaining data at position `` a '' as well as at position `` c. '' although our typographical error made it less effective than we had hoped for , we believe we have securely detected ngc  6814  during two pointings , on 1998 may 18 and on 1998 june 16 .",
    "the light curves on these two dates at both pointing positions are plotted in figure[xteagn ] . in both cases ,",
    "the curve is flat at position `` a '' at a level higher than the adjacent section of light curve taken at `` c. '' we also show , in figure[xteagnspec ] , the spectra on 1998 may 18 taken at these two pointing positions .",
    "the `` a '' spectra on may 18 and june 16 can both be fit with a single power law without an obvious fe k@xmath15 line , with a photon index of @xmath11.9 .",
    "the inferred 210 kev fluxes were 3.4 and 4.9 @xmath16 ergs@xmath17s@xmath7 , respectively , although this assumes all the photons were from the ngc  6814  ( the actual fluxes were probably somewhat lower , since some contamination by v1432  aql  is likely ) .",
    "we have another method to estimate the x - ray flux from ngc  6814 . by interpreting the mid - eclipse residual count rates from `` c '' observations ( see  4.3 for details ) as off - axis contribution from ngc  6814 , we have constructed its light curve during our _ rxte _  campaign ( figure[agnmon ] ) , although we can not rule out other contributors to the mid - eclipse counts ( including residual flux in v1432  aql  itself ) . on the two dates",
    "where the `` a '' pointing securely detected ngc  6814 , the count rates measured by this method are somewhat lower , and in fact may be more realistic .",
    "other points on this curve lack independent confirmations , but nevertheless may be considered an estimate of the level of the 210 kev flux variability of ngc  6814  during the _ rxte _  campaign .    since the 210 kev flux indicated for ngc  6814  in 1998 appeared much higher than expected , given the _",
    "results @xcite , we have investigated the long - term flux history of this object further .",
    "the most reliable determination of its 210 kev flux can be obtained from the 1993 may _ asca _  observation : the source was detected at 0.044 ctss@xmath7  in the gis , had a power law spectrum with a photon index of 1.7 and galactic absorption ( 9.8@xmath18 @xmath17 ; @xcite ) and a 210 kev flux of 1.7 @xmath19 ergs@xmath17s@xmath7 .",
    "we use this spectral shape to infer 210 kev flux from lower - energy imaging observations ( _ einstein _  ipc and high resolution imager observations in 1979 april , _ exosat _  le observations in 19831985 , the _ rosat _  all - sky survey data in 1990 , and pointed _ rosat _  pspc observations in 1992 and 1993 ) .",
    "although extrapolation can lead to inaccuracies , if the spectral shape was different ( e.g. , with a soft excess ) during any of these observations , our estimates are probably accurate to within a factor of 2 .",
    "we also note that ngc  6814  was detected at 0.36 ctss@xmath7  in the _ rosat",
    "_  all - sky survey ( http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/survey/rass-bsc/ ; the observation dates were estimated using the formula given in @xcite ) .",
    "this extends the range of pspc count rates of ngc  6814  to a full order of magnitude from a factor of 5 noted by @xcite . in figure[agnlong ] , we plot the reconstructed flux history of ngc  6814 , including , additionally , the two most reliable ( but also among the brightest ) values from our _ rxte _  campaign , and two additional points based on mid - eclipse flux during the 1989 and 1990 _ ginga _  observations .",
    "this shows a wide range in estimated flux , from @xmath20 to @xmath21 ergs@xmath17s@xmath7 .",
    "the highest point is based on _ exosat _  le rate of 0.0225 ctss@xmath7  on 1983",
    "september 4 , at an estimated 210 kev flux of @xmath22 ergs@xmath17s@xmath7 , which accounts for most of the me count rates observed on that occasion . in the 1985 october 16 observation in which the 12,000 s period was discovered , we estimate that ngc  6814  at @xmath23 ergs@xmath17s@xmath7 ( 210 kev ) , and infer that the observed me counts were roughly half from the agn and half from the cv .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that me count rate never dropped below @xmath10.8 ctss@xmath7 , even during the eclipse of v1432  aql .",
    "finally , we estimate that our _ rxte _  observing strategy was successful in greatly reducing the ngc  6814  contributions to the count rates when our intended target is v1432  aql .",
    "figure[agnmon ] , multiplied by the collimator efficiency for ngc  6814  for each c poiting ( @xmath10.1 ) , can be interpreted as the upper limit to the contamination level due to ngc  6814 .",
    "the agn and the galactic x - ray background prevent us from setting a strict upper limit to the flux at mid - eclipse to better than @xmath10.15 ctss@xmath7  per pcu .",
    "ngc  6814  is a seyfert galaxy that shows strong variability of optical continuum and lines over timescales of months and longer ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our work suggests that it also shows a strong variability in its x - ray flux over timescales of months and years .",
    "the variability level seen in figure[agnlong ] is comparable to that seen in the well - studied seyfert galaxies such as ngc  4051 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , iras  13224@xmath03809 @xcite or akn  564 @xcite .",
    "ngc  6814  also shows strong , shorter - term x - ray variability , by a factor of 3 in 8 hours ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . our new _ rxte _",
    "data also show strong variability on time scales of days , indicating such a behavior is quite common .",
    "given this rapid variability in the optical and x - ray bands , and the relatively modest width of the emission lines , we suggest that it probably belongs to the class of narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies ( for an overview of x - ray properties of these objects and correlations of x - ray and optical properties , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the emission lines are strongly variable , this source could have escaped proper identification , depending on its state when the census was taken .",
    "nls1s often have complex x - ray spectra , with a hard x - ray continuum above @xmath11 kev and a strong soft excess below , so it would be interesting to study its spectrum with an x - ray spectrometer with high and low energy sensitivities , such as _ xmm - newton_.",
    "the main features of the optical light curve of v1432  aql  were described by @xcite , which contains details of the 1993 and 1994 photometry campaigns .",
    "we have continued this coverage steadily through 2002 , including a 140 day campaign in 1998 to support the _ rxte _  observations , using primarily the telescopes of the center for backyard astrophysics ( cba ; @xcite ) .",
    "details of these follow - up campaigns will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we make use of two key findings from the optical campaigns in interpreting the x - ray data :    \\(1 ) the timings of the optical eclipses can be described by the following linear ephemeris in heliocentric julian date on the utc system :    @xmath24    this ephemeris is used throughout this paper in studying the eclipse and other orbital modulations .",
    "\\(2 ) the spin period has been steadily decreasing through 19932002 .",
    "we have measured the times of primary spin minima from light curves averaged over the 50-day beat cycle ( to avoid contamination from the orbital variability ) , and report the results in table[spinmin ] .",
    "we plot the observed minus that calculated ( o@xmath0c ) times using a test linear ephemeris , @xmath25 ( figure[spinoc ] ) .",
    "the parabola represents our best - fit quadratic spin ephemeris :    @xmath26    this equates to a period decrease with @xmath27 , confirming and extending the result of @xcite .",
    "their recent update of this result @xcite is also compatible with this level of spin - up .",
    "such a rapid spin up shows that v1432  aql  is currently well away from spin equilibrium , thus strongly favoring the asynchronous polar model of v1432  aql .",
    "this implies a synchronization time of 120@xmath2815 years , similar to that seen in other asynchronous polars .",
    "the beat period between the eclipse and spin periods was 52 days during our 1998 _ rxte _  campaign .",
    "we present the average orbital modulations of v1432  aql  observed with _ bepposax _",
    "mecs ( see table[obslogsa ] ) in the left panels of figure[saxav ] .",
    "note that the 8 _ bepposax _  observations were spread over the beat cycle , and therefore we might expect features that are persistent through the beat cycle to be prominent in this representation .",
    "the x - ray eclipse , seen at the phase of the optical eclipse as predicted by ephemeris ( 1 ) , is deep and shows sudden transitions , which we will analyze in detail in  4.3 using the _ rxte _  data .",
    "in addition , two energy - dependent dips can be seen .",
    "these dips are deeper in the 1.54.5 kev band than in the 4.58 kev band , hence show up as periods of enhanced hardness ratio [ ( 4.58 kev)/(1.54.5 kev ) ] .",
    "the hardness exceeds 1.0 between orbital phase 0.17 and 0.24 , and between 0.25 and 0.27 ; and between 0.56 and 0.72 .",
    "given these ranges , we will refer to these dips as being at orbital phase 0.2 and 0.65 . although the average intensity is lower immediately after the eclipse , the hardness ratio is lower at this phase , if anything , than the rest of the orbital cycle .",
    "the average _ bepposax _  mecs spectrum of v1432  aql  is typical of magnetic cvs in showing a hard continuum and the fe k@xmath15 emission feature .",
    "the hardness of the continuum is indicative of a complex partial covering absorber @xcite . given this , and the presence of orbital , spin , and beat periods in v1432  aql , the existing data are not good enough to allow a quantitative description of spectral changes beyond what can be seen from hardness ratio variations .",
    "in particular , although we note that the fe k@xmath15 feature appears to be variable and that this potentially provides a useful tool , it is not even clear what period the lines are modulated on .",
    "we have also folded the same _ bepposax _  mecs data , excluding those taken during orbital phase 0.951.10 , on the spin ephemeris ( 2 ) above , which we present in the right panels of figures[saxav ] .",
    "while these light curves show strong variability , a systematic pattern is not obvious ; moreover , the the spin - folded hardness ratio curve is more stable than the orbit - folded hardness ratio curve .",
    "we interpret this as indicating that the orbital modulation is more important in hard ( @xmath101.5 kev ) x - rays than the spin modulation . while the latter is expected to be present at some level",
    ", we can not claim detection of one in the _ bepposax _  data .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous claims @xcite of x - ray spin modulation ; note , however , these are based on _ rosat _  pspc data , and may apply only to soft x - rays .",
    "we also note that the _ bepposax _  observations are particularly well suited to discriminate between the orbital and spin phenomena in v1432  aql . with a lesser coverage ( typically lasting 0.53 days , much less than the beat period ) ,",
    "an object which is modulated purely on the orbital period would show an apparent modulation when folded on the spin period .",
    "it is the combination of the 8 _ bepposax _",
    "observations , spread through a beat cycle , that enables us to show the relative importance of the orbital modulation .",
    "are the dips at orbital phases 0.2 and 0.65 persistent ? to answer this question , we plot in figure[saxeight ] the folded hardness ratio curves , which appear to be less affected by random variations than intensity curves , for each of the 8 _ bepposax",
    "_  observations . since",
    "each of the 8 observations was taken in 57 hrs , much shorter than the 50-day beat period , the orbital and spin folds are indistinguishable , apart from a constant phase offset .",
    "this offset changes from observation to observation ; to guide the eye , we have indicated the location of spin phase 0.0 in each panel of figure[saxeight ] .",
    "any feature fixed in the spin period of v1432  aql  should move to keep its position fixed relative to these vertical marks ; we find no such feature .",
    "the phase 0.65 feature seen in figure[saxav ] is clearly detected in observations 2 , 3 , and 4 , each within orbital phase range 0.60.7 .",
    "it is not strongly detected in observations 1 or 6 , while the remaining 3 observations did not cover the relevant phase .",
    "the coverage of orbital phase 0.2 was poorer , but this feature clearly varied in strength between observations 1 , 2 , and 3 .    in figure[asca ]",
    ", we present the folded _ asca _",
    "gis light curves in two energy bands , and their softness ratio ( we chose this representation as the 0.72 kev count rates are consistent with zero at many orbital phases ) .",
    "this observation had a total duration of about 28 hrs , and hence this orbital fold can also be considered a spin fold with an offset .",
    "although at lower quality , we confirm the total eclipse in the 210 kev band coincident with the optical eclipse .",
    "the behavior of v1432  aql  during this observation was similar to that it displayed during the _ ginga _   observation ( see figure 13 of @xcite ) . while the _ asca _  data show a minimum at the calculated phase of the optical spin minimum ( shown as vertical lines ) , it is also at orbital phase 0.63 . from _",
    "data alone , we can not tell if this is an orbital or a spin feature ; however , given the persistence of orbital phase 0.65 feature in the _ bepposax _  data , an orbital interpretation seems likely ; the other minimum at orbital phase 0.2 is also reminiscent of the feature in figure[saxav ] .",
    "we plot in figure[avecl ] the average eclipse profiles of v1432  aql  as observed with _",
    "bepposax _  mecs and with _ rxte _",
    "pca , folded on ephemeris ( 1 ) .",
    "they both show that x - ray eclipse is coincident with the optical eclipse , and has a flat - bottomed profile typical of total eclipse by the secondary .",
    "mecs count rate drops to @xmath29 ctss@xmath7  ( mean and standard deviation ) during the flat bottom , compared to @xmath30 ctss@xmath7  out - of - eclipse : this is a total eclipse with no detectable residual flux in the mecs 1.5 - 8 kev band .",
    "examination of the energy - resolved eclipse curve is consistent with this , in particular there is no detectable residual flux in the harder ( 4.58 kev ) band .",
    "the _ rxte _",
    "pca curve bottoms out at @xmath31 ctss@xmath7 .",
    "since any residual flux at this level can be interpreted as due to contamination by ngc  6814  ( see  3.1 ) , our _ rxte _  result is also consistent with a total eclipse in v1432  aql . given this , we believe that the `` absorption dip '' interpretation of @xcite is no longer tenable .",
    "we therefore proceed further with the interpretation that v1432  aql  shows a true eclipse by the companion star .    visual inspection of the individual eclipse light curves shows that the ingress and the egress are usually very sharp , and can be located accurate to @xmath12 s by eye ( cf .",
    "figure[xteagn ] ) . however , the out - of - eclipse flux is too low in some pointings to provide reliable estimates ( that is , the limiting factor appears to be the out - of - eclipse flux level , not the reliability of the particular method used to measure the timings ) .",
    "we have therefore attempted to measure the eclipse timings by eye , and report the result in table[xteecl ] , together with the inferred eclipse widths .",
    "blanks indicate that no measurements were possible , while colons indicate uncertain results .",
    "we present this in a graphical form in figure[indecl ] , together with the average count rates during orbital phase 0.040.09 ( `` post - eclipse flux '' ) .",
    "the flux shows a clear modulation ; moreover , the shape of the modulation suggest it has a @xmath150 day period , indicative of a beat cycle phenomenon . as to the eclipse transition timings , there are instances of ingress and/or egress shifting earlier in phase over several weeks , with sudden jumps to a later phase , but it appears to have irregular variations as well .",
    "we have then constructed two composite eclipse profiles . in one , we selected light curves for which we have been able to measure the ingress timings ; we shift each curve to align the ingress before averaging the light curves .",
    "the other composite profile has the egress aligned .",
    "these are shown in figure[alignedecl ] .",
    "these composite profile show sharp eclipse transitions , that ingress and egress times do not vary in concert , and that there may be two distinct emission regions .",
    "the first point is obvious in the expanded views on the right half of figure[alignedecl ] : the composite ingress is about 2.5 bins , or 5 s , while the composite egress is slightly longer ( 67 s ) .",
    "these numbers may be overestimates since our measurement errors can only blur the composite transitions . although we can not be sure that eclipse transitions are _ always _ sharp ,",
    "it is clear that they often are .",
    "the sharpness also validates our measurement technique , and suggest that there is an intrinsic jitter in the accretion region location to cause the noisy appearance of figure[indecl ] .",
    "the fact that the egress is gradual in the ingress - aligned composite profile ( and vice - versa ) shows that the two transitions do not move in step .",
    "unless the accretion spot moves substantially within @xmath1 700 s , this means that the eclipse width also varies .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by figure[wide ] , in which we compare the average eclipse profiles of observations 1 , 2 , 13 , and 14 ( taken during days 05 and 5055 of our campaign ) , against that of observations 3 , 4 , 5 , 15 , 16 , 17 and 18 ( days 816 and 5866 ) .",
    "the latter group has weaker out - of - eclipse emission ( the part of the beat cycle during which the post - eclipse flux is steeply declining ; see figure[indecl ] ) , and hence it is difficult to measure the individual eclipses ( note the blank and uncertain entries for these eclipses in table[xteecl ] ) .",
    "however , when combined , it becomes clear that there was an eclipse which was noticeably wider ( @xmath1750 s ) than average .",
    "this can be explained if the location of the accretion region moves in latitude as well as in longitude ( see  5.4 ) .",
    "finally , the egress - aligned composite ( figure[alignedecl ] ) shows a slight rise , beginning about 0.01 cycle before the sharp egress , suggesting that a part of the x - ray emission region becomes visible about 120 s before the main emission region .",
    "however , this may well be due to a subset of the eclipses .",
    "we have found that the x - ray eclipse is total , as observed with the imaging _ bepposax _  mecs and _ asca _  gis detectors .",
    "therefore we have no doubt that this is not a dip due to accretion stream , but represents a true eclipse by the secondary , as @xcite argued ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is contrary to the conclusion that @xcite reached , so it is important to examine where our disagreement originates .",
    "@xcite have listed two reasons for believing that this was an accretion stream dip .",
    "one is that the optical eclipse light curve of v1432  aql  was unlike that of other eclipsing polars .",
    "we agree with this assessment , and interpret this simply as meaning v1432  aql  is unlike other polars , perhaps related to its asynchronous nature .",
    "the other reason is what they believed to be a residual flux from v1432  aql  during the eclipse , which was harder than the out - of - eclipse flux . given that they based this on a non - imaging _ ginga _  lac observation pointed at ngc  6814  ( see figure[map ] ) , and given that our far more extensive x - ray data ( both imaging and non - imaging ) contradict this , we believe that the residual flux was in fact from ngc  6814  or yet another source in the lac field of view . we believe that past non - imaging x - ray observations , particularly those which had ngc  6814  on - axis , are liable to be contaminated by this highly variable seyfert galaxy , and can not be re - interpreted as solely due to x - rays from v1432  aql . at some epochs , as during the _ rosat _",
    "all - sky survey ( figure[map ] ) , the agn is brighter than the cv .",
    "our conviction is strengthened by the relative stability of the feature . a simple folding ( figure[avecl ] ) results in a well - defined and sharp eclipse profile , with the only ill effect being the blurring of the transitions .",
    "this is consistent with an eclipse by the secondary of a small accretion region ( or regions ) moving about on the white dwarf surface ; we do not believe that a stream dip in an asynchronous polar can be stable to this degree .",
    "given that the x - ray eclipse is by the secondary , we must also accept that the optical @xcite and uv @xcite eclipse is also by the secondary .",
    "this implies that the geometrical pattern of optical emission is unusual among polars , and that the uv continuum is not entirely due to the white dwarf photosphere , albeit with a superficial similarity .",
    "the accretion stream is a likely candidate for the additional source of optical and uv emission ; this possibility should be investigated further using optical and/or uv data .",
    "the eclipse width , customarily defined as time between mid - ingress and mid - egress , defines the relationship between the mass ratio @xmath32 and the binary inclination @xmath33 , if the eclipsed body is centered on the center of the white dwarf .",
    "although this last assumption may be incorrect by up to the white dwarf radius for the x - ray emission region in v1432  aql , an eclipse width of 695 s is indicative of @xmath34 for @xmath32=0.5 and @xmath35 for @xmath32=0.35 ( figure[incmass ] ) . in constructing this plot ,",
    "we have used the roche - lobe shape , as in @xcite .",
    "further , we take the 85 s egress duration in the average _ rxte _  profile ( figure[avecl ] ) to be the result of the accretion region shifting on the white dwarf surface .",
    "this can be translated into a minimum size of the white dwarf , hence its maximum mass , using a white dwarf mass - radius relationship . in the upper panel of figure[incmass ] , we plot the full duration of the egress as a function of @xmath32 , for two assumed values of mass of the secondary . in this and",
    "subsequent calculations , we have replaced the roche lobe with a sphere that exactly reproduces the @xmath32@xmath33 relationship , given the 695 s eclipse duration , to speed up the calculation . the solid line is for the secondary mass m@xmath36 = 0.31 m@xmath37 , corresponding to a normal main sequence mass - radius relationship . for the maximum theoretical duration not to exceed the observed duration of 85 s ,",
    "@xmath32 must be less than 0.52 , or the primary mass m@xmath38 0.59 m@xmath37 .",
    "for a 0.22 m@xmath37 secondary ( its radius r@xmath36 of 1.2 @xmath39 a main sequence star of the same mass ) , then the @xmath32 limit shifts considerably , but the limit for m@xmath40 remains about the same .",
    "thus we conclude that the white dwarf in v1432  aql  is not particularly massive .",
    "although this conclusion is not warranted if the x - ray emission arises high above the white dwarf surface ( thus allowing the location to move by much more than one white dwarf diameter ) , this is difficult to reconcile with the compact size of the x - ray emission region implied by the rapid eclipse transitions ( figure[alignedecl ] ) .",
    "the only way around this dilemma would be a vertically compact region high above the white dwarf surface ( i.e. , with little x - ray emission lower down ) ; however , we consider this rather unlikely on theoretical grounds . if we take the combined durations of ingress and egress in the aligned profile ( figure[alignedecl ] ) of 12 s to be the maximum contribution from the vertical extent of the emission region , and",
    "subtract it from 85 s , we still require a large , low - mass primary with an estimated upper limit of 0.67 m@xmath37 .",
    "this contradicts the estimate of 0.98 m@xmath37 ( 90% confidence range of 0.781.19 m@xmath37 ) , based on the partial covering cold absorber fit to the the _ rxte _  spectrum of v1432  aql  @xcite , and implies the presence of hitherto unaccounted - for source(s ) of systematic errors in either or both methods of x - ray based mass determination .",
    "the wider eclipse sometimes seen can be most easily explained if the location of the observed x - ray emission shifted in latitude .",
    "this could be caused either by accretion switching from one pole to the other , or , if both poles are accreting all the time , by one pole going behind the white dwarf limb and the other coming into view .",
    "the required shift to widen the eclipse from 700 s to 750 s is of the order of 6000 km , comparable to the radius of the white dwarf ( r@xmath40 ) .",
    "such a large shift suggests that the dominant source of x - rays is associated with the magnetic pole on the upper hemisphere ( when the eclipse width is @xmath1700 s ) and with the lower pole when the width is wider ( see  5.4 for further discussion ) .",
    "if this is true , then the above binary inclinations are somewhat ( by a few 10th of a degree ) underestimated .",
    "how many accretion spots do we see ?",
    "whereas multiple spots can not be ruled out , we do not have any clear instances of two sharp ingresses or two sharp egresses .",
    "that is , the x - rays observed near orbital phase 0.0 appear to be always dominated by a single spot .",
    "however , the eclipse experiment can only find an accretion spot on the hemisphere facing the secondary .",
    "we infer the presence of at least one more accretion spot from the fact that v1432  aql  does not have a faint phase in which hard x - rays are essentially undetected , as observed in several polars .",
    "the ingress and egress durations in the aligned profiles ( figure[alignedecl ] ) constrain the size of the dominant accretion spot facing the secondary . in the directions perpendicular to the secondary s edge at ingress and egress ,",
    "the spot size is roughly 1100 km by 1600 km for a 0.62 m@xmath37 primary and a 0.31 m@xmath37 secondary ( or 0.13 r@xmath40 by 0.19 r@xmath40 ) ; the numbers change to 1300 km by 1900 km ( 0.20 by 0.29 ) for a 0.87m@xmath37 primary .",
    "this is much larger than found in normal , phase - locked polars .",
    "for example , in hu  aqr , @xcite report an eclipse egress of only 1.3 s , corresponding to 450 km . in the only x - ray eclipsing ip , xy  ari",
    ", @xcite found an egress of 2 s.    the above values concur with the traditional picture that normal polars should have the smallest spots , since they accrete from a stream with a small cross - sectional area .",
    "it has previously been supposed that ip accretion areas will be much bigger , since the partial accretion disk might feed accretion over a much larger range of azimuth",
    ". however , the xy  ari value is much close to that for hu  aqr than that for v1432  aql .",
    "this can be explained if the stream in polars punches into the magnetopshere and is stripped over a range of radii , while disk - fed accretion in ips is from a smaller range of radii , compensating for any larger range of azimuth @xcite .    in v1432",
    "aql , both effects could be combining to produce the much larger accretion area .",
    "it is stream fed , leading to a range of stripping radii , but the accretion flow also has a large azimuthal extent (  5.5 ) . the accretion may switch from pole to pole , and this non - stable nature could contribute to the disorganized state of the accretion , further increasing the accretion footprint . however , if this is the case , we might expect the larger spot size to lead to lower temperature of the soft component .",
    "in contrast , @xcite estimates a high temperature ( kt=60@xmath2835 ev for the blackbody component in a bremsstrahlung plus blackbody fit ) from the _ rosat _  pspc spectrum of v1432  aql , compared with a typical pspc - measured temperature of @xmath130 ev @xcite . although these are not necessarily inconsistent ( soft x - rays could originate in a small region within the larger envelop defined by the hard x - ray eclipse light curves ) , further studies are necessary to clarify the situation .",
    "the gradual shifting - forward of ingress / egress timings over @xmath120 day period suggests that the accretion region is moving retrogradely in the co - rotating frame of the binary .",
    "moreover , the fundamental period indeed appears to be @xmath150 days .",
    "these are consistent with the asynchronous polar model of v1432  aql , and are inconsistent with two of the three versions of the ip model of @xcite .",
    "although one version of the ip model is consistent with our data , the confirmation of the @xmath41 of the 12,150 s period strongly favors the asynchronous polar model . the inferred synchronization timescale of @xmath1 120 yrs is comparable to that for v1500  cyg @xcite , while we naively expected a clear difference for v1432  aql  in which accretion and synchronization torques cooperates ( unlike in other asynchronous polars in which they compete ; @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , we still have much to learn about the synchronization torques in asynchronous polars .",
    "moreover , if all asynchronous polars are recent novae , such a rapid synchronization timescale would suggest a short ( @xmath1 2000 yrs ) nova recurrence time for polars , which in turn leads to some difficulties @xcite .",
    "given the high inclination of v1432  aql , it is rather unlikely that a single accretion spot can remain in view throughout a spin cycle .",
    "for a rotational co - latitude of the spot @xmath42 , this requires @xmath43 ; since @xmath44 , it requires @xmath45 ( cf . the study of optical spin minima by @xcite ) .",
    "any accretion spots having a @xmath42 greater than @xmath46 must disappear behind the white dwarf limb ; the relative lack of spin modulation in the hard x - rays ( figure[saxav ] ) suggests that this is compensated for by the appearance of the other pole .",
    "a lack of hard x - ray spin modulation in v1432  aql  is not a total surprise , since there is a precedent in the flaring state of the well - known asynchronous polar , by  cam @xcite .    in figure[schema ] , we schematically plot the movement of these accretion spots as seen from earth at mid - eclipse . in this plot , we assume two diametrically opposed spots , moving in longitude but staying constant in latitude .",
    "this is a simplification : while the magnetic poles are expected to move this way , the offset between the accretion spot and the magnetic pole changes as a function of the magnetic pole orientation @xcite . because we can not fully model this without more observational constraints",
    ", we will use this as a crude model .",
    "furthermore , we assume that both spots accrete at all times , and we observe the region that is not hidden behind the white dwarf limb . in this schematic , the only asymmetry between the upper and lower poles is introduced by the viewing geometry ( that is , @xmath47 90@xmath48 ) . for this plot",
    ", we use @xmath32=0.55 , @xmath33=74.88@xmath48 , and @xmath42=45@xmath48 .",
    "such a model makes a specific prediction for the x - ray eclipse timings . to facilitate a better comparison with this model",
    ", we have re - analyzed the _",
    "eclipse timing by first combining light curves taken at similar beat phase . for this purpose , we use the beat period of 52 days appropriate for 1998 , based on our ephemerides ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and use hjd 2450940.99 as relative beat phase 0.0 .",
    "we then measured the ingress and egress phases in these 8 light curves , with higher signal - to - noise than in individual eclipses ; we were able to measure all 8 x - ray ingresses and 7 of 8 egresses .",
    "these , and the resultant eclipse duration , are plotted as a function of this relative beat phase in figure[beatfold ] .",
    "overplotted are the prediction of the model shown in figure[schema ] , for which beat phase 0.0 is defined as when the upper pole is most directly facing the secondary .",
    "we emphasize that this is not a fit ; although the phasing works approximately correctly , this fortuitous agreement nevertheless appears to be imperfect .",
    "the choice of @xmath42 was adjusted by hand to reproduce the gross features of the data , but no formal fitting was performed .",
    "in particular , we note that this reproduces the fact that there is one jump to later phase in each timing , with a gradual shift forward for the rest of the cycle . for the ingress",
    ", this corresponds to the jump from the disappearance of the lower pole to the left and the appearance of the upper pole to the right .",
    "the change from upper pole to lower pole produces little shift , however , given this geometry , and vice versa for the egress timing .",
    "we believe this geometry provides a reasonable framework for more quantitative modeling of the x - ray eclipse timings in v1432  aql .    when two spots are observed in turn during a beat cycle , a sudden changes in eclipse duration",
    "is predicted ( figure[beatfold ] ) , although our particular model ovepredicts the amount . in comparison ,",
    "the single spot model of @xcite predicts a gradual shift with a total amplitude of @xmath49 .",
    "the shift required by the data is @xmath16000 km (  5.2 ) , or at least @xmath50 in latitude , depending on the primary mass .",
    "we therefore consider it rather secure that the eclipse timing data , which is sensitive to the projected displacement of the emitting region , requires the presence of two hard x - ray emitting spots .",
    "the spin modulation , on the other hand , is caused by the angular dependence of emission .",
    "hard x - rays are probably emitted uniformly , whereas the optical emission is likely beamed .",
    "our result , therefore , does not necessarily contradict that of @xcite .    we have used an arbitrary epoch to define a relative beat phase for our data , which appears to be close ( figure[beatfold ] ) to the one shown in figure[schema ] .",
    "that is , at our relative beat phase 0.0 , the upper pole points roughly towards the secondary .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have defined beat phase 0.0 as when the magnetic pole points most directly at the threading region . using the epoch derived by @xcite and our spin ephemeris ( eq .",
    "2 ) , our beat phase 0.0 appears to correspond to beat phase @xmath10.2 in the system of @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as reflecting the average position of threading region in v1432  aql , which in many polars leads the secondary by a similar amount .",
    "there are two orbital dips in the _ bepposax _  light curves of v1432  aql , near orbital phase 0.2 and 0.65 ( figure[saxav ] ) .",
    "although neither persists throughout the beat cycle , when they are present , their location appears roughly fixed in the orbital frame rather than in the spin frame .",
    "what are they , and what can they tell us about the accretion geometry of v1432  aql ?",
    "first , we suspect these are the causes of the complex appearances of the power spectra , including the strong peak at about 4000 s , of the _ rosat _  data of v1432  aql  @xcite .",
    "the fact that these appear to be an orbital , rather than a spin , phenomenon is an additional evidence against the ip interpretation .",
    "however , the phasing of these dips are reminiscent of that of dipping low - mass x - ray binaries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this analogy is real , then v1432  aql  may have a ring of material circulating around the white dwarf , something akin to a partial accretion disk . in this picture , the accretion stream from the secondary hits the ring , creating the dip - causing structure at phase 0.65 .",
    "the splashed material hits the ring again at phase 0.2 , causing a secondary dip .",
    "regardless of the validity of such a picture , it does appear necessary for an accretion stream to go around the white dwarf 80% of the way before being captured by the magnetic field .",
    "similar inference has also been made from optical emission line observations @xcite .",
    "we further speculate that such a ring might be responsible in part for the unusual optical eclipse light curves and of the optical eclipse timing variations .",
    "it appears that we have plenty to learn about the accretion processes in v1432  aql  and other asynchronous polars .",
    "we draw the following conclusions from our study of v1432  aql  and ngc  6814  using our _ rxte _  campaign as well as archival _ asca _  and _ bepposax _  data :    \\(1 ) ngc  6814  is a variable source of 210 kev x - rays , occasionally reaching a few times 10@xmath51 ergss@xmath52@xmath17 level .",
    "the levels seen during 19931994 with _ rosat _  and _ asca _  appear to be the faintest it was ever seen .",
    "variability on the timescale of days and longer , and with amplitude of a factor of a few , is well - established .",
    "\\(2 ) non - imaging observations of ngc  6814  can not therefore be reinterpreted as that of v1432  aql .",
    "these data contain unknown mixtures of x - rays from both v1432  aql  and ngc  6814 , and the latter can be brighter than the former .",
    "\\(4 ) the total range of movement suggests a low - mass white dwarf , less than 0.59 m@xmath37 , if the x - ray emission is on the surface , or 0.67 m@xmath37 allowing for as much vertical extent as we think reasonable .",
    "these are lower than inferred from the modeling of its x - ray spectrum .",
    "\\(5 ) when the individual ingress is aligned before stacking the light curves , it reveals a sharp ( @xmath53 5 s ) ingress .",
    "ditto for egress ( 67 s ) .",
    "this suggests an accretion region , with an area of less than 1% of the total surface area of the white dwarf , but larger than the spots in the ip , xy  ari , or in the polar , hu  aqr .",
    "\\(6 ) the movement of the accretion spot is consistent with that expected for an asynchronous polar in which the spin period is slightly longer than the orbital period .",
    "we do not have a quantitative understanding , however , since there are currently too many free parameters .",
    "\\(7 ) there are two orbital dips in addition to the eclipse in the _ bepposax _  light curves of v1432  aql , when folded on the orbital period .",
    "this suggests that some of the accreting matter travels most of the way around the white dwarf before being threaded by the primary s magnetic field .",
