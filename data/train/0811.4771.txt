    "the heat capacity of solids characterizes the temperature variation of the internal energy corresponding to vibrations of lattice ions and movement of so called free electrons confined in solid . at temperatures @xmath10 above the debye temperature",
    "@xmath11 the phonon heat capacity prevails , fall in temperature below @xmath11 first equalizes the phonon and electron contributions to @xmath0 and then at @xmath12 the main part of @xmath0 belongs to electrons  @xcite .",
    "this general tendency in temperature evolution of @xmath0 is observed in both macroscopic and mesoscopic systems though in the latter finite sizes can reveal themselves in the temperature and size dependence of @xmath11  @xcite . inside the range , @xmath13 ,",
    "the relationship between the electron and phonon components is regulated by the particle number @xmath5 , the ratio of @xmath11 to the electron fermi energy @xmath9 ( both quantities are material dependent ) . in mesoscopic systems the spatial shape and symmetry of a sample can also affect this relationship",
    ". however the phonon and electron contributions to @xmath0 are practically independent that allows us to study here the low temperature electron heat capacity of mesoscopic systems separately from the phonon one .",
    "the electron movement in normal ( nonsuperconducting ) solids at low temperatures can be described in the framework of the noninteracting particle model ( @xmath14 ) provided particles are understood as quasiparticles introduced by the fermi liquid theory  @xcite .",
    "this theory treats quasiparticles as compound fermion type excitations with an effective mass @xmath15 that differs from the free electron mass @xmath16 and material dependence of @xmath15 causes the difference in the fermi energies @xmath9 of a solid and the fermi gas in the same volume .",
    "these quantities , @xmath15 or @xmath9 , via @xmath17 , the electron state density in the vicinity @xmath9 , determine the prefactor in the linear in @xmath10 sommerfeld s law for the electron heat capacity @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ clin1 ] ) and hereinafter @xmath10 is measured in energy units . in macroscopic systems",
    "this law is fulfilled in a wide low temperature range , @xmath19 , irrespective of the size and shape of the body .",
    "for some materials with @xmath20 there are experimental and theoretical evidences pointing out that the only parameter @xmath15 is insufficient to describe @xmath0 in a wide temperature range since the heat capacity as a function of @xmath10 can include a kink separating two linear temperature dependencies with different slopes  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding temperature is relatively high and we suppose that such radical change in @xmath15 does not concern a mesoscopic system at low temperature . in finite systems eq .",
    "( [ clin1 ] ) is applicable down to an interval of @xmath10 of order of interlevel spacings ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "within it @xmath0 increases exponentially and can display some local extrema which we shall consider in detail below . in mesoscopic systems",
    "there is also a transitional region of temperature quasilinearity where @xmath17 depends on the shape of the body though these corrections are small @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the temperature scale in finite fermion systems explicitly depends on @xmath9 that is material dependent : for electrons in metals @xmath24 @xmath25 , in heterostructures @xmath26 @xmath25 and for trapped fermi gases @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , not to be bound to an individual mesoscopic system we measure all energies and the temperature in @xmath28 , the average level spacing near @xmath9 @xmath29 @xmath30 is the average degeneracy near @xmath9 , for asymmetric systems as a rule @xmath31 , for symmetric ones values @xmath32 will be specially pointed out below .",
    "thus all results of our calculations in secs .",
    "3,4 can be projected on any real system if its @xmath9 is known .",
    "owing to eq .",
    "( [ deltaf0 ] ) the term `` low temperatures '' acquires a more definite meaning . in the first instance",
    "it will be used for the temperature range smaller than or of order of @xmath28 but these temperatures have to be really low , much less than @xmath11 otherwise the electron heat capacity can not be observed .    in the finite fermi systems",
    "@xcite besides the effective mass ( we suppose that @xmath15 is of the same order as in macroscopic bodies ) the quasiparticle description makes use of several additional parameters pertaining to the quasiparticle mean field ( the depth , radius , diffusivity of the potential and others ) .",
    "these parameters are formed mainly by the ion surroundings and among real mesoscopic systems there are cases of potentials close to rectangular @xmath3-wells as it occurs in metal clusters  @xcite whereas in quantum dots the best description of electron shells is given by @xmath2-oscillators  @xcite .",
    "these cases will be used in illustrative examples of secs.3,4 .",
    "such description idealizes and simplifies the real picture of the electron movement in mesoscopic systems as it neglects effects of disorder , coulomb and phonon interactions .",
    "however we believe that detailed ascertainment of the mean field role can help to reveal the impact of the other factors on measured thermodynamic quantities .    independently of the type of electron confinement and of that",
    "whether a system is integrable or not the common feature of quantum energy spectra in different finite systems consists in the appearance of such irregularities in the eigenvalue distributions as level bunchings or high degenerated levels in system possessing some symmetry .",
    "these irregularities can reveal themselves in measured quantities e.g. in the low temperature electron heat capacity .",
    "this fact was for the first time established by frlich  @xcite for a model spectrum with high degenerated levels .",
    "later an analogous result was obtained for spherical alkali clusters by brack et al  @xcite where the single - particle potential was found by the temperature hartree - fock method . in both cases",
    "the low temperature variation of the heat capacity displays local maxima at those particle numbers which correspond to completely occupied high degenerated levels . on the other hand the calculations of denton",
    "et al  @xcite showed that a uniform single - particle spectrum with spin degenerated levels and equal spacings between them practically gives a monotonous increase of @xmath0 if the particle number conservation is exactly taken into account .",
    "the comparison of these results has stimulated us to look for the cause of such different behavior of @xmath0 vs @xmath10 and the investigation of this problem is the subject of the following sections .",
    "our approach to this problem supposes that each mesoscopic system possesses a quite definite shape , linear size and particle number .",
    "now such systems can be fabricated by using the modern technologies and examples of such possibilities are described in refs .",
    "thus our description of mesoscopic systems follows the line of refs .",
    "@xcite but differs from the approach developed by kubo  @xcite .",
    "this approach takes into account that in many cases shapes , sizes and particle numbers of mesoscopic systems can not be fixed exactly and so thermodynamic quantities of such systems have to be calculated with single -particle spectra defined by means of statistical distributions .",
    "however even in that case when experimental conditions make it possible to study only a set of systems parameters of which are given in some limits our results can be employed through an averaging procedure .",
    "the particle number conservation plays an important role in low temperature investigations of a mesoscopic system . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the results of the canonical and grand canonical calculations can noticeably differ in this temperature range . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have developed a canonical polynomial method appropriate for studying finite systems in wide ranges of @xmath10 and @xmath5 . here",
    "the method is modified to give a convenient qualitative description of the heat capacity and show the resonance character of amplifying the heat capacity at some temperatures in the low temperature range .",
    "the subjects mentioned above are distributed over the following sections . in sec.2",
    "we introduce a new representation for the canonical occupation numbers as a continuous function of energy and then on this basis we construct the spectral heat capacity @xmath33 .",
    "the latter is especially appropriate to analyze the influence of the irregularities in the single - particle spectrum on @xmath0 in @xmath14 that allows us to explain in sec.3 the cause of arising the low temperature maxima in @xmath0 . in this section",
    "several examples of such maxima are given for both asymmetric and symmetric systems .",
    "in sec.4 we consider variations of @xmath0 caused by the shape variations in the @xmath2- , and @xmath3-mesoscopic systems at an invariable area or volume i.e. at the particle number conservation .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.5 .",
    "thermodynamic properties of the canonical ensemble ( @xmath34 ) of @xmath5 independent fermions are traditionally treated in the framework of the approximate method which virtually proceeds from the assumption that @xmath34 occupation numbers ( @xmath35 ) of single - particle states ( their energies and degeneracies are @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively ) are the same as in the grand canonical ensemble ( @xmath38 ) i.e. @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fermi - dirac function @xmath41^{-1};\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\beta = t^{-1}.\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "two types of local maxima have to occur : at @xmath10 nearly equal to @xmath8 of the symmetric system and at @xmath382 corresponding to small splitting of the fermi level at deformation .",
    "thus , small symmetry disturbances do not practically change the positions of those maxima in @xmath0 which occur in the symmetric case but at much lower temperatures there can appear other maxima if @xmath383 .    at stretching ( squeezing ) a circular cylinder along its symmetry axis ( axis @xmath384 ) that is accompanied by decreasing ( increasing ) its cross - section owing to the volume conservation the appearance of deformation extrema in @xmath0",
    "is caused by accidental level degeneracies at a proper relationship between radius @xmath173 and height @xmath322 of the cylinder .",
    "their ratio is therefore adopted to be a deformation parameter @xmath385 .",
    "the degeneracy of single - particle levels in a potential with circular symmetry arises due to spin degree of freedom and in consequence of symmetry of the potential ( conservation of angular momentum @xmath384-projection @xmath386 ) i.e. the degeneracy takes values equal to @xmath387 ( @xmath388 ) or @xmath357 ( @xmath389 ) .",
    "it means that levels merging in points @xmath302 or going out of these points can possess different degeneracies .",
    "as pointed out above , this difference in degeneracies leads to asymmetry of the maxima disposed around points @xmath302 on the heat capacity curve vs @xmath300 .",
    "such cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ cylosc ] where each of the first three level crossing points ( @xmath328 in these points ) is bordered by two maxima with distinct amplitudes while the last case displays the symmetric picture .",
    "the following degeneracies and occupation numbers at @xmath90 can be ascribed to levels @xmath91 and @xmath101 : near the first and third points @xmath302 in fig .",
    "[ cylosc ] at crossing @xmath390 , @xmath378 , @xmath391 , @xmath392 , at splitting @xmath393 , @xmath394 , @xmath392 ; near the second point @xmath302 at crossing @xmath395 , @xmath391 , @xmath392 , at splitting @xmath393 , @xmath394 , @xmath396 and near the last point @xmath302 given in fig .",

    "the adduced numbers of @xmath249 and @xmath82 explain the values of amplitudes in maxima in accordance with the rule given above which can be detailed for two crossing levels @xmath91 and @xmath101 if one writes out the leading term in the equation for @xmath0 : @xmath399^{-1 } ( \\beta\\delta ) ^2\\exp(-\\beta\\delta),\\ ] ] where @xmath149 , as before , is the difference @xmath400 .",
    "the temperature evolution of the extrema in @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ cylosc ] develops approximately in the same manner as in previous case in fig .",
    "[ lay42t012 ] .",
    "the examples of the heat capacity shape dependence considered in this section indicate that in spite of the differences in space dimensionality and conditions governing the appearance of the heat capacity extrema the shape of the @xmath5 particle system can be adjusted so ( most likely it is possible to make only experimentally ) that in a low temperature range @xmath401 the fermion heat capacity can attain to its maximum or any lesser value at a given @xmath5 ( the needed value of @xmath0 depends on the problem where these values are of particular importance ) .",
    "this property of mesoscopic systems can reveal itself also in granular systems .    to show it consider two mesoscopic systems .",
    "the first is a granular system which is composed of close - packed metallic ultrasmall granules as it is described e.g. in ref .",
    "these granules are assumed to be in thermal contact i.e. they are kept at common temperature but the mutual electron exchange is impossible ( the very weak intergranular electron coupling ) .",
    "here we again idealize the situation and suppose that each granule contains @xmath5 conduction electrons , all they are identical in size and shape and the heat capacity of each granule at a fixed low temperature ( @xmath402 ) is equal to @xmath403 , eq .",
    "( [ clin1 ] ) .",
    "if the granular system consists of @xmath82 such granules ( the summary electron number @xmath404 ) its heat capacity , @xmath405 , can be essentially distinct from @xmath0 of the second system which is a relatively large monolithic mesoscopic system with the same number of conduction electrons @xmath406 . here",
    "the fermi energies of each granule and the monolithic system are assumed to be practically the same .",
    "since the mean level spacing in the monolithic system is @xmath82 times smaller than in the granule the fixed temperature can appear so high for the monolithic system at @xmath407 that its heat capacity can take only the shape - independent sommerfeld s value @xmath408 .",
    "therefore the ratio of the electron heat capacities of the granular system and the monolithic one is equal to the quantity @xmath409 given in some figures of this and previous sections such as figs .",
    "[ br14391442 ] ,  [ cube1008 ] ,  [ 2maxintfunsph ] ,  [ 2maxintfunbr ] .",
    "thus these figures gain the second content : they give not only values of @xmath238 vs @xmath10 for a system with a fixed particle number @xmath5 but the same curves describe the ratios of @xmath0 in granular and monolithic systems , where the former are composed of small @xmath5 particle granules : briquettes ( figs .",
    "[ br14391442 ] ,  [ 2maxintfunbr ] ) , cubes ( fig .  [ cube1008 ] ) and spheres ( fig .",
    "[ 2maxintfunsph ] ) . additionally in fig .",
    "[ rubik ] we show the variety of values @xmath238 for cubic systems in a wide range of @xmath410 .",
    "for description of fermion properties of mesoscopic @xmath5-particle systems which are in thermal equilibrium with surroundings ( the canonical ensemble ) in the framework of @xmath14 we have suggested a new formalism representing the single - particle level occupations as a continuous function of energy @xmath163 similar to the fermi - dirac distribution . in @xmath14",
    "many static thermodynamic quantities can be obtained by applying this representation . in particular",
    "it allows the electron heat capacity @xmath0 to be calculated as a convolution of the state density with function @xmath182 , the spectral distribution of @xmath0 that gives the contribution of each single - electron state to @xmath0 .",
    "the two hamped shape of @xmath182 vs @xmath163 gives possibility to account for the appearance of local maxima in @xmath0 within the low temperature range ( @xmath197 , the latter is the mean level spacing near @xmath9 ) by virtue of the resonance amplification of contributions of states nearest @xmath9 if the positions of two peaks in @xmath182 coincide with energies of either two high degenerated levels near @xmath9 ( or level bunchings ) or even two solitary double degenerated levels .",
    "however @xmath0 vs @xmath10 for the uniform spectrum with equal spacing between spin degenerated levels does not reveal noticeable maxima .",
    "it is worth mentioning that local maxima in @xmath0 are observed more distinctly on curves @xmath238 ( or @xmath411 ) vs @xmath10 where @xmath239 is the sommerfeld s electron heat capacity linear in @xmath10 .",
    "the temperature of the maximum in @xmath0 ( the resonance temperature @xmath8 ) makes up a part of @xmath203 , the difference between energy levels in the vicinity of @xmath9 and depends on @xmath93 , the fermi level occupation number at @xmath90 .",
    "so if @xmath92 is high ( @xmath412 ) ( @xmath413 is the fermi level degeneracy ) then @xmath414 whereas for the case of two solitary spin degenerated levels ( @xmath9 and @xmath287 ) with @xmath243 this temperature is equal to @xmath415 .",
    "thus , establishing @xmath8 and studying @xmath5-dependence of @xmath0 in samples of identical shapes can give information concerning the single - electron level structure near @xmath9 .",
    "within the low temperature range the heat capacity appears to be shape - dependent at an invariable spatial area ( for @xmath2-systems ) or volume ( for @xmath3-systems ) . at continuous alteration of some parameter @xmath300 characterizing deformation of the system",
    ", @xmath0 can display oscillations vs @xmath300 with minimum values of @xmath0 at such deformations where the system gains an additional symmetry .",
    "it is shown that at @xmath401 the ratio of the electron heat capacities of a granular system consisting of @xmath82 identical insulted @xmath5-electron subsystems ( @xmath407 ) and a monolithic system with the same summary electron number ( @xmath416 ) is equal to @xmath409 which can be stretched from zero to several units .    on the whole",
    ", the presented material can be viewed as evidence of possible essential deviations of low temperature ( @xmath197 ) properties of electron mesoscopic systems from those established for @xmath417 that is caused by the irregularities in single - electron spectra and this has to be taken into account at consideration of both the heat capacity and all other thermodynamic properties of finite electron systems .",
