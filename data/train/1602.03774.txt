    "the field of spatial networks is emerging as an important topic within network science @xcite .",
    "the distinguishing feature of this work is that network nodes are assigned a position in euclidean space , typically @xmath0 , with the distance between them described by the euclidean metric .",
    "a major goal in this area is to investigate the way in which constraining connectivity in a manner related to node proximity influences network organisation .",
    "application domains include city science @xcite , electronic circuits @xcite , wireless networks @xcite , leaf venation @xcite , navigability @xcite and transportation @xcite .",
    "spatial networks vary in the extent to which they respect _ planarity _ : the property of a spatial network having edges that do not cross .",
    "while , for example , sexual contact networks may be embedded in space , they need not respect planarity . by contrast , the layout of a microchip must be planar since conductor lines may not cross without creating a junction .",
    "transport networks tend to be nearly planar ( a relatively small number of bridges and tunnels allow edges to cross without creating a junction vertex ) .",
    "planarity is also a consideration in the construction of infrastructure such as wireless networks @xcite .",
    "despite the relevance of planarity considerations across a wide range of nework domains , the role of planarity in network formation is an under - represented issue in the spatial networks literature @xcite .",
    "following barabsi & albert s demonstration that preferential attachment results in a scale - free network @xcite , the conditions under which the power - law degree distribution obtains within spatial networks has been a significant area of investigation ; for a review see reference @xcite .",
    "three principal classes of mechanism have been identified in this regard @xcite ; ( i ) link length penalisation , ( ii ) embedding a scale - free network within a lattice and ( iii ) space filling .",
    "two models make up class ( i ) ; the modulated ba model and the geographical threshold graph .",
    "the first of these two is an extension of the ba model where the probability of a new connection is inversely proportional to the euclidean distance between the nodes under consideration and the degree of the existing node . as such , the modulated ba implicitly assumes a power law degree distribution . in the geographical threshold model ,",
    "nodes are connected when the product of their respective weights and a function of the distance between them exceeds a pre - defined constant . in this case",
    "a scale - free network results only when either the distribution of the weights or the distance function follows a power law .",
    "furthermore , we note that the canonical model of link length penalisation , the random geometric graph , only produces a scale - free degree distribution when the nodes are themselves inhomogeneously distributed on the plane @xcite . models in class ( ii ) assign an intrinsic degree @xmath1 to all nodes in a lattice .",
    "members of the lattice are then selected at random and connected to their @xmath1 nearest neighbours subject to a distance constraint @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution in this case is precisely that which is assigned to the model during its construction .",
    "thus , models in classes ( i ) and ( ii ) only result in a scale - free distribution when a power law is assumed as some aspect of their inputs .    class ( iii ) recursively partitions the space by adding new nodes to the plane and then connects them to the existing graph",
    ". two of these models , the apollonian network ( hereafter dan , the deterministic apollonian network ) @xcite and its stochastic variant the random apollonian network ( hereafter ran ) @xcite , are of primary interest to this study .",
    "both models choose faces of an existing triangulation of the plane and split them into three , resulting in a new triangulation .",
    "analytical treatment of their respective degree distributions reveal them to be power laws of the form @xmath2 . for the dan ,",
    "this exponent is @xmath3 and for the ran it is @xmath4 .",
    "further work in this vein has investigated the average path length @xcite , degree spectrum @xcite and dynamical properties of the dan @xcite while a similar body of research exists for the ran @xcite . a unifying framework for apollonian networks ,",
    "the evolutionary apollonian network , is a triangulation model which can be induced to produce either the dan or the ran by variation of a single parameter @xcite .",
    "however , none of these apollonian growth models attribute an explicit point in space to their nodes ; in each case it is network topology that determines the outcome of the process .",
    "furthermore , when interpreted spatially , the nodes of these models are not distributed uniformly in space .    as a final example in class ( iii )",
    ", we highlight the model of mukherjee & manna @xcite . here , new nodes are connected to a random end of the nearest edge .",
    "the model is notable in that it is the only existing spatial growth process we have identified that results in a scale - free distribution when ( a ) nodes are distributed uniformly at random on the plane and ( b ) there are no other inputs to the model that have a power law form .    in this paper",
    "we present two related mechanisms ; the first , planar growth ( pg ) , seeks to directly address the impact of a planarity constraint on a network growth process .",
    "briefly , pg incrementally builds a network by placing new nodes at random locations in space and connecting them to other nodes such that planarity is maintained . we introduce it in section [ sec : models ] alongside two reference cases ; one of which considers a network that grows in time but does not enforce planarity , while the other considers a network built over a static set of nodes through the addition of planarity - preserving edges .",
    "in contrast to the reference cases , pg results in a power law degree distribution and we present evidence to support this claim in section [ sec : degree ] . further investigation of pg is presented in sections [ sec : analysis ] and [ sec : planar : relax_planarity ] , where we examine other key network measures and demonstrate the consequences of relaxing planarity , respectively .",
    "the second mechanism is named apollonian planar growth ( apg ) and is introduced in section [ sec : apg ] as a reformulation of pg as an apollonian growth process .",
    "consideration of apg as an object of study in its own right leads to further contributions .",
    "firstly , the apg is inherently spatial ; in contrast with the topological character of its precursors , the dan and the ran .",
    "secondly , pg can be viewed as a generalisation of apollonian growth processes to cases where @xmath5 , the number of connections made when a node is added to the network , is less than 3 . in section [ sec :",
    "apg : comparison ] , we further develop apg as a single parameter model , the variation of which tunes the exponent of the network s degree distribution .",
    "the dan and the ran can then be seen as special cases of apg , with pg intermediate between them .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper in section [ sec : summary ] where we summarise our results .",
    "we begin with a description of the models and an analysis of the degree distributions that they produce .    [",
    "sec : models ]      planar growth creates spatially embedded networks with @xmath6 nodes and average degree @xmath7 on a unit euclidean square that has rigid boundary conditions .",
    "we wish to begin the process with a planar network that has nodes distributed uniformly on the plane .",
    "to do so ten nodes are placed uniformly at random upon the unit square with @xmath8 planar edges between them . as they are added , each node after the first is connected to an existing node ; the edge being chosen so as not to violate planarity . once all ten nodes have been placed , unconnected pairs are then chosen at random and an edge is chosen between them ; again subject to the caveat that planarity is always maintained .",
    "we continue choosing node pairs until @xmath8 edges are added or until all possible node pairs have been tried .",
    "the resulting network is accepted irrespective of its final number of edges .",
    "tests of the procedure over 10,000 realisations show that for @xmath9 the average degree of the initial network was @xmath10 , while for @xmath11 it was @xmath12 . despite the results for the @xmath11 case we retain this method of initialisation",
    "since the number of nodes and edges is statistically insignificant in comparison to the finished network and the method reliably produces initial networks with the desired properties .",
    "the algorithm now enters the growing phase where the following steps are repeated @xmath13 times : + ( 1 ) place a new node , @xmath14 , uniformly at random within the square .",
    "\\(2 ) repeat @xmath5 times :    ( 2a ) pick a node @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "( 2b ) if @xmath17 does not cross an existing edge then add @xmath17 otherwise go to 2a .",
    "+ if step 2 can not be completed because @xmath5 valid nodes do not exist then remove node @xmath14 and any associated edges and repeat step 1 .",
    "+ as reference cases for pg we consider two degenerate variants of the mechanism ; one with no planarity constraint , @xmath18 , and one with no growth , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath18 is very similar to pg except that edge connections are always allowed .",
    "this scenario is equivalent to the uniform attachment model originally introduced by barabsi & albert @xcite where it was shown to result in networks with an exponential degree distribution . in @xmath19",
    "we create a static population of @xmath13 nodes placed uniformly on the unit square .",
    "pairs of nodes are picked at random and an edge is drawn between them , provided this new edge does not cross an existing one .",
    "we continue until @xmath20 edges have been added .       at various stages of its growth .",

    "all results averaged over 20 experiments with @xmath9 .",
    "the dashed line is the best fit for the apg experiment , a power law with exponent , @xmath29 . as with all exponents in this paper",
    ", @xmath30 has been estimated using the method of maximum likelihood estimators outlined in clauset et al .",
    "( b ) average maximum degree observed for the pg , @xmath18 and @xmath19 networks .",
    "the dashed line is the expected value of the maximum degree for a power law with exponent @xmath31 , the estimated value of the exponent in the @xmath32 case .",
    "the dotted line is a plot of the expected maximum degree for a network with an exponential distribution.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure [ fig : growing ] is a series of visualisations of a pg network from its initialisation until it reaches 500 nodes .",
    "qualitatively it seems that some nodes acquire a disproportionately high amount of connections hinting that the network has a skewed degree distribution .",
    "we proceed , in figure [ fig : m2_mechanisms_k_hist]a , with a plot of the degree distribution for a planar growth experiment of order @xmath27 , along with a @xmath18 experiment of order @xmath27 and a @xmath19 experiment of order @xmath28 .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath13 is reported for @xmath19 due to computational limits .",
    "nonetheless the results show the degree distributions of both reference cases to be exponential while the pg experiment approximates a power law distribution .    to investigate finite size effects we plot , in figure [ fig : m2_mechanisms_k_hist]b , how the maximum degree observed during these experiments varies with the size of the network .",
    "following newman @xcite , we also plot the analytically derived relationship between @xmath33 , the mean maximum degree for networks with a power law degree distribution , and @xmath13 ; @xmath34 .",
    "we find it to be in good agreement with the observations which provides strong support for the hypothesis of a power law distribution .",
    "the expected value of the @xmath35 member of a sequential ordering of the random variables of an exponential distribution with parameter @xmath36 is @xmath37 = h_i/\\lambda$ ] , where @xmath38 is the @xmath35 harmonic number .",
    "barabsi & albert found the degree distribution for the uniform attachment model to be @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "we therefore approximate the average maximum degree for a @xmath18 network of order @xmath13 with @xmath41 .",
    "the plot of this curve also matches well with our empirical data supporting the claim that the degree distributions generated for both types of reference cases are exponential .",
    "considered as a whole , the evidence in this section suggests that the network produced by the planar growth process is scale - free .",
    "the necessary ingredients in order to produce this outcome are growth and the planarity conservation .",
    "when either of these aspects are removed we observe an exponential degree distribution .",
    "however , results discussed in this section are unsatisfactory in that the distribution has only been shown to hold over one order of magnitude",
    ". we will attend to this in the next section .",
    "zhou s original ran algorithm @xcite starts with an equilateral triangle on the plane .",
    "network construction proceeds by repeatedly choosing a face of the triangulation at random , placing a new node within it and connecting that node to the vertices of the face .",
    "note that the probability of a node receiving a new edge is proportional to the number of triangles of which it is a vertex .",
    "this count of triangles is , in turn , equal to the degree .",
    "as such , the ran is a form of linear preferential attachment ; furthermore , its degree distribution can be analytically demonstrated to be a power law with exponent @xmath42 when the degrees of the three vertices of the external triangle are ignored .",
    "apollonian planar growth ( apg ) refines this algorithm by giving the nodes an explicit position on the face of the triangle .",
    "which face is chosen to receive a new node is still random but now this probability is in proportion to the area of the face , i.e. , face @xmath14 is chosen with probability @xmath43 defined by the following formula :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the area of face @xmath14 and @xmath46 is the set of faces present in the simulation at step @xmath47 .    the new node is then placed uniformly at random within triangle @xmath14 and connected to its vertices .",
    "clearly , this algorithm is equivalent to planar growth on a triangle with @xmath11 .",
    "it has the advantage that the triangulation can be represented as a ternary tree @xcite , thereby allowing for more efficient implementation of the model .",
    "thus , in figure [ fig : m2_mechanisms_k_hist]a we present a plot of the degree distribution of an apg network of @xmath26 nodes which shows the fit of the power law extending over two orders of magnitude on both axes with an estimated exponent of @xmath29 .",
    "we now vary @xmath5 , the number of connections introduced with each new node , to determine if our observations are peculiar to the @xmath48 cases .",
    "three is an upper bound on @xmath5 , which can be established by consideration of euler s formula for a planar graph , see discussion in reference @xcite for details .",
    "we therefore vary @xmath5 between one and three .",
    "non - integer values of @xmath5 are attained by always attaching @xmath49 edges to a new node and then attaching a further node with probability @xmath50 .",
    "the network size in these experiments was fixed at @xmath51 and were observed to exhibit power laws . in table",
    "[ tbl : m_alpha ] we report the estimated exponents for these networks which decrease from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . from this point of view",
    "pg can be thought of as a generalisation of apg , which strictly has @xmath11 , to any average degree less than three .      in this section",
    "we have estimated several different exponents of assumed power law distributions using the method of maximum likelihood estimation introduced by clauset et al .",
    "mle can be used as a principled method to estimate the exponent but does not establish if a power law is an appropriate model to describe the data under consideration . to do so clauset et al .",
    "describe two further steps ; firstly , goodness of fit is quantified by a @xmath54-value calculated by bootstrapping from the estimated model and comparing using the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic .",
    "secondly , the power law is compared with other candidate distributions via log likelihood ratios .",
    "we acknowledge that noise in empirical data can cause it to fail the bootstrapping test , thereby rendering the first step of clauset et al.s method inconclusive .",
    "we therefore follow the approach recommended by alstott et al .",
    "@xcite and use the second step as a means to identify the most appropriate distribution . in table",
    "[ tbl : m_loglike ] , we report the log likelihood ratios , @xmath55 , and associated @xmath54-values for two experiments , the pg network with @xmath56 and the apg network of order @xmath57 .",
    "the alternative distributions considered were the exponential :    @xmath58    the stretched exponential :    @xmath59    powerlaw with cutoff :    @xmath60    and lognormal : @xmath61}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath36 , @xmath64 & @xmath65 are the parameters to be estimated for the given distribution , @xmath66 is a constant that is dependent on these parameters and @xmath1 is the degree .    the power law model is favoured with high significance over the exponential and stretched exponential models for both pg and apg networks .",
    "the lognormal model is not found to be a significantly better fit than the power law model for both network models ( indicated by the high @xmath54-values ) .",
    "the power law with cutoff model is found to be a significantly better fit than the power law model ( and also a significantly better fit than the log normal model : with @xmath67 for the apg network and @xmath68 for the pg network ) .",
    "this might be expected given that it employs more parameters .",
    "moreover , the estimated parameters for the functional form of the power law with cutoff suggest that the cutoff is not substantive .",
    "we observe that @xmath69 for the apg network and @xmath70 for the pg network .",
    "we also note that the maximum degree observed for the apg network across all 20 experiments was @xmath71 while for the pg network it was @xmath72 . both of these values are less than @xmath73 indicating that while the cutoff may fit the data more appropriately the magnitude of the cutoff does not significantly impact the power law .",
    ".estimated exponents of networks of order @xmath51 with varying @xmath5 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     estimated values of the exponent of the degree distribution , @xmath62 , observed for apg networks of order @xmath74 with varying area weighting exponent , @xmath63 . the standard error , @xmath64 , in each case is 0.01 .    in light of this reasoning",
    "we further modify the algorithm by placing each new node so that it exactly trisects its containing face ; thereby guaranteeing a hierarchy of face sizes by depth within the tree . for @xmath75 behaviour",
    "was again as expected ; exponents were observed to increase from @xmath76 to @xmath77 as @xmath63 increased from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "a further experiment with @xmath80 gave an exponent of @xmath81 which , prima facie , suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect .",
    "however , it is apparent from figure [ fig : trisection_100 ] that the fit is not indicative of the degree distribution of the area weighted apg with trisection .",
    "this is because the clauset et al .",
    "method is inappropriate for quantifying the exponent of power laws that exhibit the sort of discretisation we see in the plot .    to better understand the distribution as @xmath82 we instead follow the formula for",
    "the degree distribution of a dan presented in andrade et al s original paper @xcite and plot it on figure [ fig : trisection_100 ] alongside our own data .",
    "it is clear that the discretisation of the experiment closely matches that of the analytical calculation . in a further experiment we set @xmath83 , i.e.",
    "the largest triangle was always chosen , and grew a network of 265,720 nodes , the order of an apollonian network that has been iterated 11 times . in this case",
    "the analytical calculation exactly matches the experimental data , confirming that the area weighted apg with trisection approximates the dan as @xmath63 increases .    to complete the analysis we considered networks with @xmath84 ,",
    "results obtained indicate that an exponential distribution takes hold in this regime . in this regime ,",
    "new nodes tend to appear within the model s smallest triangle , thereby creating new smallest face from the resulting trisection .",
    "thus , new nodes will tend to congregate in the same region of the model .",
    "this contrasts with the @xmath85 case where division of the largest face effectively lessens the probability of that region being selected in the next iteration of the process .",
    "thus , the potential for nodes to be distributed over the entire face is a key feature in the onset of the power law degree distribution .     grown using apollonian planar growth with @xmath86 .",
    "faces were divided by trisecting in to three equal areas in this version of the model .",
    "empty circles are the degree distribution of an apollonian network of the same order .",
    "dashed line is a plot the best fit of the exponent , @xmath87,scaledwidth=58.0% ]",
    "we have introduced planar growth as a model of spatial network formation in which a network is grown over time such that planarity is maintained .",
    "resulting networks have been found to be scale - free , have the small world property and are mildly disassortative .",
    "it should be noted that pg attains the power law degree distribution with a uniform distribution of nodes in space .",
    "as far as we are aware this is only the second example , mukherjee & manna @xcite being the first , of a spatial growth process that attains this outcome under this constraint .",
    "the scale - free property is dependent on two aspects of the process ; sequential growth and maintenance of planarity .",
    "removal of either aspect results in a network with an exponential degree distribution .    to the extent that the planarity constraint is relaxed the degree distribution degrades from a power law to the exponential case .",
    "similarly , smooth crossover was noted for the clustering and assortativity of these networks . we have discussed those spatial networks that are nearly planar and further note that newman has articulated a desire for a quantification of the degree of planarity @xcite .",
    "we offer these results as an intial step towards resolving this question .",
    "a refinement of the model , apollonian planar growth , demonstrated a connection between planar growth and apollonian networks .",
    "weighting the area selection of triangles during apollonian planar growth allowed us to easily recover the random apollonian network while a further variation , trisection , was required in order to produce the deterministic apollonian network .",
    "as such , weighted apollonian planar growth with trisection acts as a framework that generalises the two existing apollonian models .",
    "this paper also opens up various interesting questions for future research . in the research",
    "presented here we have analysed the effects of a planarity constraint on the structure of a growing network .",
    "it appears of interest to investigate planarity constraints in conjunction with other network formation mechanisms .",
    "for instance , an area in network research that has found much attention in the literature are questions of optimal design of network structures @xcite .",
    "it would be of interest to further investigate to what extent planarity restrictions can constrain such optimal network topologies .",
