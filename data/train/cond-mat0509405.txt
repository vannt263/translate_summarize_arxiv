    "the anderson model @xcite is widely used to investigate the phenomenon of localisation in disordered materials . especially the possibility of a quantum phase transition driven by disorder from an insulating phase , where all states are localised , to a metallic phase with extended states has lead to extensive analytical and numerical investigations of the critical properties of this metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite .",
    "the one - parameter scaling theory plays a crucial role in understanding the mit @xcite .",
    "it is based on an ansatz interpolating between metallic and insulating regimes @xcite .",
    "so far , scaling has been demonstrated to an astonishing degree by numerical studies of the anderson model @xcite .",
    "however , most studies focused on scaling of the localisation length and the conductance at the disorder - driven mit in the vicinity of the band centre .    in the present paper",
    ", we will show numerical results for cubes of volume @xmath3 which are consistent with scaling also at the energy - driven transition across the mobility edge @xmath4 near the band tails .",
    "in particular , we find that at @xmath5 the d.c .",
    "conductivity @xmath6 close to @xmath4 is well described by the power - law @xcite @xmath7    moreover , knowing the explicit energy and system size dependence of the conductance @xmath8 allows us to calculate the low - temperature dependence of thermoelectric properties such as thermopower , lorenz number and thermal conductivity in the fully quantum coherent regime . for these , similarly detailed theoretical investigations of scaling at the mit are still lacking . here",
    "we present an approach based on the recursive green s function technique @xcite .",
    "thermoelectric transport properties describe the response of a material to the presence of a small external electric field and a small temperature gradient @xmath9 .",
    "e.g. , the induced ( _ thermo-_)_electric field _",
    "@xmath10 in the seebeck effect is directly proportional to @xmath9 and the constant of proportionality is called _ thermopower _ @xmath2 . in general , the dependency of the electric ( @xmath11 ) and thermal currents ( @xmath12 ) on a electric field and a temperature gradient up to linear order are @xcite @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the electron charge .",
    "this defines the _ kinetic coefficients _ @xmath15 .",
    "additionally , for zero magnetic field , the onsager relation states that @xmath16 @xcite . using the definitions of the thermoelectric properties @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ curr ] ) one can express @xmath1 and @xmath2 in terms of the kinetic coefficients as @xmath17 assuming elastic scattering of independent electrons by static impurities or by lattice vibrations one can obtain the kinetic coefficients from the chester - thellung - kubo - greenwood ( ctkg ) formulation @xcite , @xmath18^{(i+j-2 ) } \\left[- \\frac{\\partial f(e,\\mu , t)}{\\partial e } \\right ] de\\ ; ,      \\quad ( i , j=1,2)\\ , ,      \\label{ctkg}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the chemical potential and @xmath20 is the usual fermi function .",
    "the anderson model of localisation is based upon a tight - binding hamiltonian in site representation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a localised state at site @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the hopping parameters , restricted as usual to nearest neighbours .",
    "the on - site potentials @xmath25 $ ] are uniformly distributed random numbers .    for calculating the energy dependence of the two - point conductance",
    "@xmath26 we use the recursive green s function method @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the kubo - greenwood formula for the linear response regime and non - interacting electrons @xcite . in order to obtain correct results for purely elastic scattering ,",
    "metallic leads were attached at both ends of the system . in this case",
    "the formalism given above is equivalent @xcite to the landauer - bttiker formulation @xcite . to get the conductance @xmath27 of the disordered region only , we have to subtract the contact resistance due to the leads .",
    "this gives @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is the number of propagating channels at the fermi energy @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "an additional complication arises because the number of transmitting lead - modes drops to zero outside the lead - energy band , whereas the disordered system still has states at these energies .",
    "this mismatch gives rise to a lead - induced reduction in @xmath27 .",
    "the problem can be overcome by shifting the energy of the disordered region while keeping the fermi energy in the leads in the lead - band centre .",
    "this is equivalent to applying a gate voltage to the disordered region and sweeping it  a technique similar to mosfet experiments .",
    "we set the disorder strength to @xmath31 and impose fixed boundary conditions in the transverse direction @xcite . for each combination of fermi energy and system size",
    "we generate an ensemble of @xmath32 samples ( except for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 were generated ) and examine the size - dependence of the average and the typical conductance , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we find that for @xmath39 the typical conductance is proportional to the system size @xmath40 and the constant of proportionality is negative .",
    "this corresponds to an exponential decay of the conductance with increasing @xmath40 and is characteristic for _ insulating _ behaviour . for @xmath41 being larger than @xmath42",
