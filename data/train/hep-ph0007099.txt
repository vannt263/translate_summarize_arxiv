    "with the increased precision of deep inelastic scattering data @xcite , and the need for accurate predictions at the tevatron and the lhc , it is clearly essential to extend global parton analyses to next - to - next - leading - order ( nnlo ) in @xmath11 . although the relevant deep inelastic coefficient functions have been known for some time @xcite , there is only partial information on the corresponding splitting functions . the @xmath12 ( and 10 for non - singlet )",
    "moments have been calculated @xcite , which effectively provide information on the high @xmath4 behaviour of the splitting functions .",
    "also known is the most singular @xmath13 behaviour at small @xmath4 , both for the singlet @xcite , and the phenomenologically less important nonsinglet @xcite splitting functions , and the leading @xmath14 contributions @xcite of the nonsinglet splitting functions , and of the @xmath15 dependent part of @xmath16 @xcite . recently",
    "van neerven and vogt @xcite have constructed compact analytic expressions for the splitting functions which represent the fastest and the slowest evolution that is consistent with the above information .",
    "we believe that these two extreme behaviours are indeed realistic . although there are indications that the true behaviour of the splitting functions is likely to be slightly nearer to that corresponding to the slow evolution possibility , for simplicity we shall use the average of the two extremes for our central  nnlo analysis .",
    "it is important to stress an important difference between our analysis and the procedure used by van neerven and vogt @xcite .",
    "the latter authors start from a _ fixed _ set of partons and a fixed scale ( @xmath17  gev@xmath18 i.e @xmath19 ) and present the differences between lo , nlo and nnlo evolution .",
    "here we compare the partons , and the consequent predictions for physical observables , obtained by performing global analyses at lo , nlo and nnlo .",
    "both works present nnlo results obtained using the extreme estimates of the @xmath20 splitting functions .    in section  2",
    "we discuss the changes to the global analysis that are necessary in going from a nlo to nnlo formulation .",
    "then , in section  3 , we present seven new fits to the deep inelastic and related data ; that is lo , nlo and five nnlo analyses . to gain insight into the impact of the nnlo contributions , we discuss essential features of the fits in terms of the behaviour of the splitting ( and coefficient ) functions . in section  4",
    "we compare the partons obtained in the lo , nlo and nnlo analyses , paying particular attention to the gluon distribution in the small @xmath4 region .",
    "the parton distributions are scheme dependent and are not themselves observable .",
    "the comparison of lo , nlo and nnlo predictions for physical observables is much more meaningful . in section  5",
    "we study the predictions for the longitudinal structure function , @xmath0 .",
    "this is a particularly relevant observable as it directly reflects the behaviour of the gluon distribution at small @xmath4 , and hence most directly probes the stability , or convergence , of parton analyses as we go from the lo , to the nlo , and then to the nnlo framework . in section  6",
    "we compare the lo , nlo , nnlo predictions for the cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath3 boson production at the tevatron @xmath21 collider and at the lhc .",
    "these observables mainly depend on the quark distributions in the region @xmath22",
    "gev@xmath18 , and @xmath23 and 0.006 respectively .",
    "the stability of the predictions offers the possibility of using the @xmath2 and @xmath3 events as a luminosity monitor of the collider .",
    "finally in section  7 we give our conclusions .",
    "the procedure is based on the nlo analyses described in refs .",
    "however at nnlo it is important to allow the gluon distribution to become negative in the low @xmath4 , low @xmath24 domain .",
    "we therefore adopt the parameterization [ eq : a1 ] xg ( x , q_0 ^ 2 ) = a_g x^-_g ( 1 - x)^_g ( 1 + _ g + _ g x ) - a_g^ x^- _ g^ ( 1 - x)^_g^ at the starting scale @xmath25 of the evolution . the parameter @xmath26 turns out to be large in the additional negative term and so this contribution is only important at small @xmath4 .    it is necessary to implement other extensions of the formalism when going to nnlo .",
    "first , we use the three - loop expression for @xmath11 , in the @xmath27 scheme .",
    "second , we require more detailed matching conditions when evolving through the heavy flavour thresholds . the nnlo treatment of heavy flavours is discussed in the appendix .",
    "our main interest is in the quality of the fit to deep inelastic data at small @xmath4 . at high",
    "@xmath4 we have a slight inconsistency in our nnlo analyses in that we use nlo expressions to fit to drell - yan , jet production and @xmath28 boson rapidity asymmetry .",
    "the nnlo corrections to all these quantities have not yet been calculated .",
    "however note that the physical observables that we study ( namely @xmath0 and @xmath5 ) sample low @xmath4 partons , which are determined mainly by deep inelastic data for which the nnlo formalism is consistent .",
    "we perform lo , nlo and nnlo global fits to the set of deep inelastic and related data that was used in refs .",
    "@xcite , except that now we use the jet @xmath29 distribution measured at the tevatron to pin down the gluon distribution at large @xmath4 , instead of prompt photon hadroproduction .",
    "the qcd description of the latter process has outstanding theoretical problems @xcite .",
    "a second change is that we include all the available preliminary hera data @xcite , which have higher precision than hitherto .",
    "the consequence of replacing prompt photon data by the jet data is that the nlo fit is now similar to that achieved by the previous mrst(@xmath30 ) set of partons @xcite .",
    "a satisfactory description of the tevatron jet data is obtained , including particularly the normalization .",
    "five nnlo fits were performed . the central  fit and the four extremes ( @xmath31 ) , where @xmath32 corresponds to the slow ( fast ) evolution of parton @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out that the nnlo fits with slow and fast gluon evolution are very similar , and so it is sufficient to present results for just two of the extreme choices of the splitting functions , namely [ eq : a2 ] a & & a_q a_g  ( slow  evolution ) , + b & & b_q b_g  ( fast  evolution ) .    in figs .  1 and 2 we show the lo , nlo and nnlo descriptions of the @xmath34 data @xcite in a few representative @xmath4 bins .",
    "we display only the central   nnlo fit .",
    "however the quality of all the nnlo fits is similar .",
    "it is encouraging to note that , as we proceed from the lo @xmath35 nlo @xmath35 nnlo analysis , there is sequential improvement in the overall quality of the description of the data . in particular , in going from the nlo @xmath35 nnlo fit",
    ", there is an improvement in the simultaneous description of the nmc and hera @xmath34 data .",
    "indeed the quality of the nnlo fit is improved for almost all subsets of the data .    from figs .",
    "1 and 2 we can see that at nnlo the scaling violations increase both at small @xmath4 and at large @xmath4 . at small @xmath4",
    "this is due mainly to the nnlo contribution to @xmath36 , whereas at large @xmath4 the nnlo term in the coefficient function plays the dominant role .",
    "the relevant @xmath37 behaviour of the splitting functions are we use the coefficient of the moment space expression in the limit @xmath38 rather than the real limit as @xmath39 . ]",

    ", we can investigate the importance of the increased scaling violations by looking at the higher - twist component of @xmath34 extracted using a phenomenological analysis in which a term @xmath42 is included in the fit , as in ref .",
    "the values of the higher - twist coefficient @xmath43 can be seen in table  1 . at very high @xmath4 a large positive higher - twist contribution is clearly needed .",
    "this decreases slightly as we move from lo to nlo to nnlo , but there is no indication that its presence will be eliminated by even higher orders .",
    "we note that the conclusion that nnlo contributions largely remove the need for higher twist at high @xmath4 in previous nnlo analyses @xcite has been based on analysis of ccfr data only , which exists at far higher @xmath44 than the slac data included in our higher - twist fit , though it has also been suggested that when nnlo coefficient functions are used the higher twist may be almost entirely due to target mass effects @xcite . at @xmath45",
    "the higher - twist contribution changes sign , becoming generally negative . at",
    "lo its magnitude is then quite large , demonstrating that the evolution is too slow at low @xmath24 , both for nmc and hera data , as is obvious from fig .",
    "the magnitude of the higher - twist contribution for @xmath46 decreases significantly going to nlo , and decreases again , to very small values , at nnlo .",
    "indeed , the sign of the small-@xmath4 higher - twist contributions at nnlo is not even well - determined , with many @xmath4-bins preferring a slightly positive value .",
    "the implication seems to be that higher - twist contributions at small @xmath4 are small , and their apparent size is decreased by the inclusion of more perturbative corrections .",

    "in fig .  3 we compare the parton distributions found in the nnlo fit to those in the nlo analysis .",
    "we plot the nnlo / nlo ratios for the gluon , and the up and down quark distributions , at two values of @xmath24 .",
    "as we go from the nlo to the nnlo analysis , several changes in the distributions are worth noting .",
    "first , the decrease of the quark distribution at high @xmath4 and the slight increase at low @xmath4 reflect the behaviour of the coefficient functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively .",
    "second , recall that in the nlo analysis the input gluon distribution decreased at small @xmath4 . at nnlo",
    "we see the gluon decreases even more .",
    "this decrease at low @xmath4 occurs because of the increase of @xmath36 , see ( [ eq : a3 ] ) .",
    "the consequent rise at @xmath49 is to ensure that the momentum sum rule is satisfied . the gluon distribution drives the evolution at small @xmath4 .",
    "as we evolve to higher @xmath24 , the effect of the nnlo term in the splitting function decreases , and a smaller gluon leads to slower evolution than in the nlo analysis .",
    "hence , for example , by @xmath22  gev and @xmath50 , all nnlo partons are about 1015% smaller than those at nlo .",
    "since the biggest nnlo effect is in the small @xmath4 behaviour of the gluon , we study this distribution in more detail .",
    "4 shows the gluon obtained in the lo , nlo and nnlo global fits at various values of @xmath24 .",
    "a clear lo @xmath35 nlo @xmath35 nnlo hierarchy for @xmath51  gev@xmath18 is a consequence of momentum conservation and a much too large a gluon at small @xmath4 .",
    "] of the small @xmath4 behaviour of the gluon is evident , which reflects the direct link with the hera deep inelastic data via @xmath36 of ( [ eq : a3 ] ) .",
    "note also that the evolution of the nnlo gluon is made even slower because of the ( small ) negative nnlo contribution in @xmath16 , see ( [ eq : a4 ] ) .",
    "the starting  parametric forms of the gluon found in the lo , nlo and nnlo global analyses are [ eq : a6 ] & & xg ( x , q_0 ^ 2 ) = + & & = \\ {    l 31.2x^0.390 ( 1 - x)^6.18 ( 1 - 5.23 + 7.33x ) ( lo ) + [ eq : a7 ] 51.8x^0.535 ( 1 - x)^6.55 ( 1 - 3.92 + 4.68 x ) - 1.67x^-0.032(1 - x)^8.21 ( nlo ) + [ eq : a8 ] 14.4x^0.397 ( 1 - x)^5.56 ( 1 -3.22 + 4.36x ) - 0.705x^-0.151 ( 1 - x)^8.69 .",
    "( nnlo )    .",
    "the extreme  curves @xmath52 and @xmath53 , plotted in fig .  4 , demonstrate that the greatest uncertainty , coming from the lack of complete knowledge of the nnlo splitting functions , is in the small @xmath4 behaviour of the gluon .",
    "nevertheless even allowing for the extreme   spread in the nnlo fits we see that the hierarchy in the small @xmath4 behaviour of the gluon persists .",
    "4 also shows that the gluon obtained from the nnlo analysis becomes negative at small @xmath4 and small @xmath24 , as anticipated in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) .",
    "however the gluon distribution itself is not a physically observable quantity .",
    "it is scheme dependent .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "4 shows the gluons obtained from analyses at different orders in the @xmath27 factorization scheme . if on the other hand we were to adopt the dis scheme , then we find that the nnlo gluon is only marginally negative at low @xmath4 at @xmath54  gev@xmath18 . in order to investigate the true implications of the convergence of the perturbative series we must examine the predictions for physically observable quantities .",
    "the behaviour of the longitudinal structure function , @xmath0 , is particularly appropriate as it is sensitive to the small @xmath4 behaviour of the gluon .",
    "the production cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons at the hadron colliders are representative of other relevant observables .",
    "we therefore study the predictions for these quantities below .",
    "the lo contribution to @xmath0 is @xmath55 , and so a consistent ( factorization scheme independent ) nnlo prediction of @xmath0 requires the @xmath20 coefficient functions .",
    "these are not known at present , but we do know much of the same information as for the @xmath20 splitting functions , that is the @xmath12 moments and the @xmath39 behaviour .",
    "hence we estimate the coefficient functions in the same spirit as used by van neerven and vogt for the @xmath20 splitting functions .",
    "the central  estimates for the nnlo contributions to @xmath56 are ( where the common factor of @xmath57 is taken out ) [ eq : a9 ] c_l , g^(3 ) ( x ) & = & + [ eq : a10 ] c_l , ns^(3 ) ( x ) & = & + [ eq : a11 ] c_l , ps^(3 ) ( x ) & = & where ns and ps refer to quark non - singlet and pure - singlet respectively .",
    "in fact the @xmath58 dependent part of the non - singlet coefficient function is in principle known exactly from the calculations in @xcite , but are small and well modelled by our simple analytic expression .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath0 gluon coefficient function is shown in fig .",
    "the two dominant features are ( i ) a sizeable contribution just below @xmath59 , and ( ii ) a large growth with decreasing @xmath4 arising from the most singular terms found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in fact at small @xmath4 we have , at leading order we present the coefficient of the moment space coefficient function as @xmath38 . ]",
    "[ eq : a12 ] c_l , g ( x ) n_f and the same expression , modulo the colour factor @xmath60 , for @xmath61 ( except at leading order ) .",
    "the non - singlet coefficient functions beyond lo are very strongly peaked as @xmath62 . at nlo",
    "the coefficient function @xcite ( with @xmath63 factored out ) in this limit behaves like [ eq : a13 ] c^(2)_l , ns ( x ) & & 4c_f , and there is an enhancement compared to the lo result , @xmath64 , due to the @xmath65 terms .",
    "the machinery for computing the dominant @xmath65 terms for @xmath66 for all orders in @xmath11 has recently been devised @xcite , and in principle we could use this to evaluate the parts @xmath67 at @xmath68 for @xmath69 . however , the resulting expressions are very far from compact and at this order we simply choose to use the the information on the moments which is available to give us a good estimate of the coefficient function at high @xmath4 .",
    "this confirms that again the coefficient function is very peaked for @xmath62  its size largely compensating for the extra power of @xmath70 .",
    "a more sophisticated parameterization than that used in ( [ eq : a11 ] ) should really include higher powers in @xmath65 , but since the expression matches a range of moments very well it will give an accurate representation of the coefficient function convoluted with the smooth parton density .    the predictions for @xmath0 obtained from the parton distributions of the different global fits",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the progressive increase at high @xmath4 is attributable to the large ns coefficient functions for @xmath62 . at small @xmath4 the lo and nlo in @xmath71 of ( [ eq : a12 ] ) . ]",
    "predictions mirror the gluon distribution ( sampled in the region of @xmath72 due to the convolution ) . the nnlo prediction of @xmath0 also mirrors the shape of the gluon at low @xmath24 and moderate @xmath4 , turning over at @xmath23 . then , at even smaller @xmath4 , the very large @xmath20 contribution of @xmath71 takes over , which after convolution with the gluon , prevents @xmath0 becoming negative and , in fact , results in a steep rise with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "as we evolve up in @xmath24 the effect of the @xmath20 term in @xmath71 diminishes and eventually the nnlo prediction for @xmath0 mirrors the shape and size of the gluon via the @xmath73 term in @xmath71 .",
    "hence there is a transition at @xmath74 where the nlo overtakes the nnlo prediction and @xmath50 the rate of evolution , @xmath75 , is negative at nnlo . ] of @xmath0 . at the lowest values of @xmath24 the nnlo prediction of @xmath0 should be regarded with caution .",
    "if we go below @xmath54  gev@xmath18 the dip in @xmath0 in fig .",

    "the lo @xmath35 nlo @xmath35 nnlo convergence of the predictions is much better than for @xmath0 , because the boson cross sections depend mainly on the _ quark _ distributions at @xmath89 ( tevatron ) and @xmath90 ( lhc ) .",

    ", we see that at the tevatron energy the increase of about @xmath93 from nlo to nnlo is due in roughly equal parts to the slight increase in the @xmath94 and @xmath95 partons in this @xmath4 range ( see fig .",

    "the nnlo band is larger than at the tevatron because the partons are probed at smaller @xmath4 , where there is more uncertainty in the nnlo evolution .",
    "we may conclude from fig .",
    "8 that perturbative convergence is not a dominant uncertainty in predicting the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections .",

    "although the nnlo splitting functions are not fully known , enough information is available to bound their possible behaviour . even allowing for the full spread of the uncertainties of the functions , we are able to draw interesting conclusions .",
    "the inclusion of nnlo effects gives an overall improvement in the description of the data , which is due to the increased scaling violations at both large and small @xmath4 . in a similar manner , if higher - twist contributions are allowed , they decrease in magnitude for both large and small @xmath4 as we increase the order , approaching very small values for @xmath99 , but remaining large and positive at large @xmath4 .",
    "the latter behaviour largely reflects the expectations arising from the presence of heavy target corrections .",
    "fitting to the data using lo , nlo and nnlo frameworks leads to a hierarchy of gluon distributions at small @xmath4 , such that the nnlo ( @xmath27 ) input gluon is found to go negative for @xmath100 .",
    "however , we stressed that perturbative convergence should be tested for physical observables , rather than for the parton distributions themselves . to this end , the lo , nlo and nnlo predictions were made for the longitudinal structure function @xmath0 , and for @xmath2 and @xmath3 hadroproduction cross - sections .",

    "the convergence then improves slowly with increasing @xmath24 and reveals a lo @xmath35 nlo @xmath35 nnlo hierarchy in the predictions for @xmath0 , which mirrors that of the gluon but with increased stability .",
    "a measure of the uncertainty is the @xmath103 change in @xmath0 in going from the nlo to nnlo prediction at @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the convergence deteriorates with decreasing @xmath4 and most likely is due to the neglect of @xmath77 contributions beyond the nnlo dglap framework . at low @xmath24 ( @xmath106 )",
    "the @xmath77 terms are even more important .",
    "there is also the possibility of higher - twist contributions , which for @xmath0 may be different at small @xmath4 from those for @xmath34 @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the predictions of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 hadroproduction cross sections are rather stable , due to the more direct relation between the fitted data and the predictions .    here",
    "we have addressed , in an exploratory fashion , theoretical issues arising from including nnlo corrections in global parton analyses of deep inelastic and related data .",
    "however new hera data with increased precision will soon be available .",

    "for the treatment of heavy flavours we use an approximate nnlo generalization of the thorne - roberts variable flavour number scheme ( vfns ) .",
    "this scheme was presented in detail in @xcite , and the general framework outlined for all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "essentially one obtains the vfns coefficient functions in terms of the fixed flavour number scheme ( ffns ) coefficient functions and partonic matrix elements @xmath107 .",
    "the former are the coefficient functions calculated assuming that the heavy quark ( denoted by @xmath108 ) has no parton distribution , but may only be created via a hard scattering process .",
    "the matrix elements define the @xmath109flavour parton distributions in terms of the @xmath14flavour parton distributions , i.e. the @xmath110 tell one how the heavy quark distribution is constructed from the light partons and the @xmath111 tell one how the light parton distributions are altered by internal heavy quarks ( in particular @xmath112 ) .",

    "the matrix elements and ffns coefficient functions are unambiguously calculable , but there is some element of choice in the vfns coefficient functions since there are more degrees of freedom than there are constraining equations .",
    "one may eliminate this ambiguity by simply calculating diagrams assuming one has initial state heavy partons and keeping mass dependent terms .",
    "however , this leads to unphysical threshold behaviour for the coefficient functions , and we choose instead to impose as physical a constraint as possible .",
    "hence , we make the derivative of @xmath113 continuous in the gluon sector ( which overwhelmingly dominates ) as one switches from ffns to vfns coefficient functions and turns on the heavy quark parton distribution at @xmath114 .",
    "this choice of vfns coefficient functions is essentially a freedom in factorization schemes , with all schemes becoming identical when summed to all orders , but differing by terms @xmath115 at finite order .    at nnlo , all vfnss experience two related technical complications due to internal quark loops which may or may not be cut .",
    "first , it has long been known that the parton distributions become discontinuous at @xmath116 at @xmath86 @xcite . in some factorization schemes . ] for example , the heavy quark distribution at @xmath117 becomes [ eq : ap2 ] ( h+|h)^(2 ) ( x , m_h^2 ) = ( ) ^2 [ a^(2)_hgg(m_h^2 ) + a^(2)_hqq ( m_h^2 ) ] .",
    "the gluon and light quarks also acquire discontinuities as the heavy parton distribution is turned on , such that momentum is conserved , see @xcite . these lead to a corresponding discontinuity in the coefficient functions , maintaining the continuity of the structure functions , e.g. solving ( [ eq : ap1 ] ) at nnlo at @xmath116 one obtains [ eq : ap3 ] c^ff(2)_hg = c^vf(2)_hg + c^vf , ns(0)_hh a^(2)_hg .",
    "the second complication at nnlo arises because the heavy quarks in the final states are no longer just those coupling directly to the external vector boson probe , but can be generated even when it is a light quark coupling to this probe . in principle",
    "it is a technical shortcoming of our scheme that the implicit definition of the heavy quark structure function involves the heavy quark coupling to the external vector boson .",
    "this simplifies the factorization , but is not strictly physically correct .",
    "a more general prescription is discussed in @xcite , where a cut in invariant mass has to be implemented above which heavy quark - antiquark pairs generated away from the external vertex may be defined as observable .    in this paper",
    "we simply ignore both these complications .",
    "this is due to the fact that the whole analysis is approximate and also because both lead to effects which in practice are extremely small .",
    "the grv gluon at small @xmath4 is large at @xmath118 , while ours is small and even becomes negative at the same scale .",
    "hence , the effect is very much smaller . ]  especially when compared to other uncertainties .",
    "both complications should be dealt with in a truly precise nnlo analysis once the exact nnlo splitting functions are known , though we are confident that they ( especially the latter ) will lead to tiny effects . however , at present we do not even know the nnlo , i.e. @xmath68 , ffns coefficient functions , so a precise vfns is impossible to define .",
    "nevertheless , this is where our heavy flavour prescription comes into its own .",
    "other prescriptions @xcite which use the coefficient functions from diagrams involving single initial state heavy partons rely on precise cancellations between the heavy quark distributions and terms involving the vfns coefficient functions in order to maintain smooth behaviour .",
    "for example , at nnlo a large contribution to the heavy quark evolution from @xmath119 needs to be cancelled by a term @xmath120 to avoid too quick a growth of @xmath113 for @xmath121 just above @xmath122 . in our prescription",
    "the correct threshold behaviour is built into @xmath123 automatically , i.e. @xmath124 if @xmath125 , and such precise cancellations are not necessary  simply including nnlo evolution of the heavy quarks without nnlo heavy quark coefficient functions at all maintains smooth behaviour .",
    "however , we want to obtain the correct nnlo high @xmath24 limit .",
    "hence , we include the massless @xmath86 coefficient functions for the heavy quarks , but weighted by a factor of @xmath126 , i.e. the velocity of the heavy quark in the centre of mass system , to impose the correct threshold behaviour at low @xmath24 .",
    "this procedure is very simplistic , but it contains all the relevant physics .",
    "significant improvements to this approximate procedure would require the nnlo ffns coefficient functions .",
    "finally , we note that the heavy flavour longitudinal coefficient functions behave like @xmath127 , and thus are heavily suppressed until very high @xmath24 . at such high @xmath24 ,",
    "the @xmath68 coefficient functions have become relatively unimportant , and hence we simply omit the @xmath68 longitudinal coefficient functions until a more precise analysis is possible .",
