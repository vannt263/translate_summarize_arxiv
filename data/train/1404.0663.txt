    "the bayesian analysis of gravitational wave detector data for gravitational wave bursts has generally modeled possible bursts in terms of finite set of parameters and their a priori distributions @xcite .",

    "is estimated and used to decide whether a burst has been detected ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of a finite set of parameters to model the burst imposes unnecessary constraints on the form of the burst as a function of time .",
    "additionally , the bayes factor may be ill - defined or overly sensitive to the parameters or their prior distributions ( see chapter 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "here we adopt a non - parametric approach to the problem of burst detection : instead of adopting a parameterized model for the burst and identifying parameter priors , we adopt a gaussian process prior for the burst function itself and use the observations to constrain the burst as a function of time @xcite .",
    "gaussian process is defined as a stochastic process for which any finite collection of the samples has a multivariate normal distribution .",
    "besides , as an alternative to the bayes factor , we introduce the deviance information criteria ( dic ) @xcite , which provides a quantitative measure of how well the data favors the presence of a gravitational wave burst .",
    "finally , we demonstrate our analysis method to simulated pulsar timing array data including a gravitational wave burst .",
    "compared with the popular method proposed by finn & lommen @xcite ( denoted as `` f&l '' in the following ) , we improve the analysis in two aspects :    * we provide the estimation of the burst durations by incorporating the smoothness of the gravitational wave signals into the prior distribution , while f&l ignored this important point and resulted in a less informed analysis .",
    "* we marginalize over all parameters in likelihood function and prior distribution when we compute posterior distribution and evidence of gravitational waves .",
    "this procedure should be followed to perform a full bayesian analysis and provide robust inference @xcite . nevertheless , f&l chose to optimize over the parameters in prior distributions , which would increase the false alarm risk and underestimate the parameter uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this is why f&l obtained strong evidence of gravitational waves and precise estimation of parameters even if the signals are incredibly weak @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these two aspects in details in section [ sec : fl ] , and we will demonstrate the advantages of our method over f&l in section [ sec : demo ] by detailed examples .",
    "nonparametric data analysis covers techniques that do not assume the model used to fit the data is fixed @xcite .",
    "bayesian nonparametrics stem from seminal work of ferguson @xcite and doksum @xcite in early 1970s , which tried to incorporate nonparametric statistics into bayesian methodology .",
    "the advantage of bayesian nonparametrics over other nonparametric techniques is that it is able to incorporate our expected characteristics of the signals into a prior distribution to set a constraint on the feasible signal patterns we try to search from the data @xcite .",
    "ohagan first proposed the general prior distribution for regression analysis , which refers to extract signals from noisy data , is gaussian process @xcite .",
    "he also proved that the expected characteristics of the signal patterns can be encoded into the mean and covariance of the gaussian process @xcite .",
    "this approach has then been applied to solve various regression problems in geostatistics , meteorology , computer science , machine learning , etc . here",
    "we apply bayesian nonparametric regression to search for gravitational wave bursts from pulsar timing array data .    in section [ sec : bayes ] , we describe the general principles and methodology of bayesian nonparametric analysis . in section [ sec : app ] we apply this method to analyze simulated pulsar timing array data including the contribution from a gravitational wave burst . in section [ sec : demo ]",
    "we illustrate the effectiveness of this analysis by applying it to several representative examples .",
    "we will also demonstrate the strength of our method over f&l .",

    "bayesian nonparametric analysis is introduced to analyze the data when analysts can not model the data by a set of fixed number of parameters @xcite . here",
    "we give a brief description of the basic framework of this methodology , applied to the analysis of time series data that may include a signal we are trying to detect .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for details and other applications of bayesian nonparametrics .",
    "when we can not model the signal by a fixed number of parameters , bayesian nonparametric approach assigns a prior distribution on the signal itself and then infer its pattern @xcite .",
    "for example , when time series data @xmath0 contains a signal denoted by a vector @xmath1 and additive zero mean noises , we can assign a prior distribution @xmath2 on @xmath1 , and according to bayes theorem , the posterior probability density of @xmath1 would be : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the likelihood function , which will be a gaussian distribution of @xmath0 if the noises are gaussian distributed .",
    "bayesian nonparametric inference will first choose a prior @xmath5 based on our expectation of @xmath1 , and then infer @xmath1 by computing posterior @xmath6 .",
    "the probability density @xmath2 describes our expectations of the signal before we analyze the data set @xmath0 .",
    "it plays the key role in bayesian nonparametric analysis since it would set a constraint on the feasible function forms we try to explore @xcite .    in general , we may write @xmath1 in a discrete fourier transform since the observation times are discrete @xcite , @xmath7 for signal @xmath1 beginning at time @xmath8 and ending at some later time @xmath9 , and with @xmath10 the observation times in the interval @xmath11 $ ] . under the minimal assumption that there is no preferred signal starting time @xmath8 or duration",

    "we would fix @xmath15 and choose some prior for the @xmath16 @xcite . instead , however , let us take a different approach .",

    "correspondingly , the prior of @xmath1 can be written as @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the unknown parameters embedded in the kernel such as @xmath16 .",
    "such parameters are referred to as _ hyperparameters _ @xcite . in full bayesian inference",
    ", we also need to choose a prior probability density @xmath21 , i.e. , _ hyperprior _ , for the hyperparameter set @xcite , and the joint prior of @xmath1 and the hyperparameters would be @xmath22 correspondingly we will infer hyperparameters together with @xmath1 .",
    "we can include our expectation of the signal in the prior probability density @xmath5 by choosing a specific kernel and a specific hyperprior .",
    "to recap , our non - parametric analysis has characterized the signal by the parameter set @xmath1 and set its prior distribution as a gaussian process . unlike conventional regression approaches there is no predetermined mathematical form of @xmath1 aside from those we impose via a prior on the kernel @xmath23 .",
    "an appropriate choice of @xmath23 can set a strong constraint on the smoothness , the trend and the variations of the signal patterns @xcite .",

    ".   summarizes bayesian nonparametric inference , which gives estimation on the signal @xmath1 and hyperparameters .      at this point",
    ", it is worth comparing the bayesian nonparametric inference described above and the conventional inference methods that try to fit the data by a model with a fixed number of parameters .",
    "the conventional inference methods assume that we know the analytical formulae of the signals we try to detect and we can characterize them with a fixed number of parameters . for example , to detect gravitational waves from a non - spinning binary black hole inspiral , we can characterize the signal by post - newtonian formula with 8 parameters to characterize the signal  chirp mass , mass ratio , coalescence time , strain amplitude , sky location of the source , polarization and inclination angle of the orbital plane @xcite . in this way , we can obtain key characteristics about the signals since the parameters we use to model the signal usually have explicit physical meanings .",
    "however , this approach requires that we are able to achieve the analytical formulae of the signals .",
    "when the analytical formulae of the signals are not available , the conventional approach could model the signal by a linear superposition of a finite number of basis functions ( e.g. chapter 16 of @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the basis function and @xmath37 is the corresponding coefficient that would be the unknown parameters we try to infer ; @xmath15 is the number of the basis functions , which has to be fixed .",
    "for example , we can choose @xmath36 as the fourier modes like eq .  .",
    "however , if we do not know much information of the signals , we do not know how many basis functions we need to choose",
    ". a model with too many basis functions would be so complex as to overfit the data while a model with too few basis functions would be so simple as to underfit the data .",
    "in contrast , baysian nonparametric approach directly infers the signal pattern by assigning gaussian process prior distributions to set strong constraints on it , which would avoid using a detailed physical model .",
    "however , since bayesian nonparametrics do not use the parameters that describe the physical characteristics of the signal like conventional methods , it would provide less direct insight for the signal .",
    "the advantages and disadvantages of bayesian nonparametric analysis and conventional approach are summarized in the following :    * bayesian nonparametric analysis is more effective to infer the signals when we do not know their analytical formulae .",
    "however , it provides less physical characteristics of the signals than the conventional approach .",
    "* the conventional approach would infer the physical parameters that characterize the signals , which provides more direct insight than bayesian nonparametric approach .",
    "however , it requires that we have adequate information to model the signals with a fixed number of physical parameters , which is not always available .",
    "pulsar timing data collected from an individual pulsar consists of a time series of pulse time of arrival ( toa ) measurements , which are compared with the predicted arrival times based on a timing model including all non - gravitational - wave effects .",
    "the difference between the observed and expected pulse arrival times are referred to as timing residuals .",
    "a collection of the timing residuals obtained from an array of pulsars would include timing noises which are uncorrelated among different pulsars , and potentially gravitational wave effects which are correlated among the pulsar timing array . to seek the evidence of a gravitational wave burst",
    ", we need to match the timing residuals with a model that characterizes the contribution of the burst .",
    "however in general cases , we do not have physical models for the burst sources and so we are not able to characterize the gravitational wave burst by some analytical formula or by a fixed number of basis functions . correspondingly , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] , the conventional approach is not applicable .",
    "therefore , we introduce bayesian nonparametric analysis described in the last section to detect and characterize gravitational wave bursts with a pulsar timing array .      a plane gravitational wave propagating in direction @xmath38 is represented by the transverse - traceless gauge metric perturbation @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the polarization tensor .",
    "following @xcite , the @xmath41th pulsar timing response to such a plane gravitational wave can be written as    @xmath42\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 the direction from earth toward the @xmath41th pulsar and @xmath44 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the integral of @xmath47 , @xmath48    we can see that the gravitational wave contribution is the sum of two functionally identical terms , one time - shifted with respect to the other by an amount proportional to the earth - pulsar distance along the wave propagation direction .",
    "the first term is referred to as the `` earth term '' , while the second is referred to as the `` pulsar term . ''",
    "when the duration of the gravitational wave bursts @xmath49 and the observational duration of pulsar timing array data @xmath50 are much less than @xmath51 , it is most likely that only the earth term contributes to the correlated timing residuals @xcite , unless ( 1 ) there are fortuitous lines of sight of a pair or more of the pulsars where the time delay among those pulsar terms is small enough to be within the observational duration @xcite ; ( 2 ) there are a large number of pulsars providing a long time baseline that might be able to detect more burst sources @xcite .",
    "however , in the current international pulsar timing array , there are not so many pulsars whose timing noises are low enough to be effective in gravitational wave detection @xcite , and it is uncertain when we can have a pulsar timing array with a large number of low timing noise pulsars .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we only consider the effects of the earth term on the detection of gravitational wave bursts , and the corresponding pulsar timing response can be written as    [ eq : tau ] @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the pattern function of the @xmath41th pulsar , @xmath54    in the pulsar timing array waveband , the internal motion of the gravitational wave sources is expected to be smooth with the evolution of time @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the waveform @xmath55 of a gravitational wave burst is expected to be a smooth funtion of the observation times @xcite and thus @xmath56 should also be a smooth function of time .    furthermore , for a detectable gravitational wave burst through pulsar timing arrays , the duration of the burst should be shorter than observation duration , or otherwise it is not considered as `` burst '' signal .",
    "these two properties of the timing residual are very important and they are considered as our prior knowledge of the gravitational wave bursts . as we will see in the next subsection , we will take advantage of this prior information to model the pulsar timing response to the passage of a gravitational wave burst .        as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : bayes ] , to apply bayesian nonparametrics to detect gravitational wave bursts , we need to choose an appropriate prior probability to constrain feasible function forms of the signals . for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we have 3 expectations as discussed in the last subsection    * they are the same for different pulsars . *",
    "they are smooth functions of time .",
    "* they have a characteristic time duration that is shorter than the observation time .",
    "we need to choose their gaussian process priors with appropriate kernels to fulfill these three expectations .",
    "we do not have any information on the arrival time of the gravitational wave burst , which means that priors of @xmath57 and @xmath58 should hold the time translational symmetry @xcite and the kernels should only depend on the difference between observation times , i.e. , stationary @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are also expected to be infinitely differentiable on time ; correspondingly , their mean squares under their gaussian process priors have to be infinitely differentiable , which requires their stationary kernels @xmath59 infinitely differentiable at @xmath60 @xcite , where @xmath61 denotes difference between any two observation times . this is a very rigorous requirement since the stationary kernels have to be both positive semidefinite and infinitely differentiable , and only few of kernels we know satisfy it @xcite . the one with the least number of hyperparameters is the square exponential kernel @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are hyperparameters .",
    "we assign two different kernels to two polarization components of the gravitational wave burst because the two components are independent of each other @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the two rms amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath66 are two independent hyperparameters .",
    "the two polarizations can be transformed into each other by basis rotation in the sky plane @xcite so one might think that we can set @xmath67 by fixing a rotation angle . however , in this case , we have to treat the rotation angle ( polarization angle ) as another independent hyperparameter , which indicates that there have to be two independent hyperparameters to characterize the amplitudes of the two polarization components .",
    "the hyperparameter @xmath65 is the characteristic time scale of the burst , which characterizes temporal correlation of @xmath57 and @xmath58 along the observation times . when @xmath68 , the values of the kernels would exponentially damp , and @xmath56 and @xmath69 would be almost uncorrelated",
    "correspondingly , @xmath70 should be approximately the duration of the burst and @xmath65 should be shorter than the observation duration .",
    "here we assume that @xmath65 is the same for both of the two polarization components because the duration of the burst scales with the ratio of the typical radius to the internal velocity of the source @xcite , which is the same for the two components .",
    "we can see the kernels eq .",
    "are special cases of the general form eq .   by performing a discrete fourier transform    @xmath71    compared with eq .  , choosing the special kernels as eq .",

    ", we incorporate the expected characteristics of gravitational waveforms into a gaussian process prior to set strong constraints on the feasible signal patterns ( see section [ sec : priorgw ] ) . especially , due to the smoothness of the gravitational waveforms as expected , we are able to narrow down our searches for _ smooth _ signals only by setting the prior eq .  .",
    "as a bonus , we can estimate the burst durations even though we do not have physical models for the sources .",
    "this is exactly the strength of bayesian nonparametric analysis @xcite .    in comparison",
    ", f&l does not incorporate any gravitational waveform characteristics into their analysis , because they ignore the temporal correlation and the smoothness of the gravitational waveforms by choosing the kernels in the gaussian process prior as diagonal matrices @xcite .",

    "correspondingly , their analysis would offer redundant degrees of freedom and provide less informed inference .",
    "therefore , even though f&l also tries to directly infer the burst signals but not fit the data with a specific physical model , it may not be considered as bayesian nonparametric analysis because it misses the most important advantage of such analysis .      in our bayesian nonparametric analysis , we choose prior distributions for both parameters and hyperparameters , and we compute the posterior distributions and dics by marginalizing over parameters and hyperparameters to perform a full bayesian inference . in this way , we provide a robust inference and minimize the risk of false alarms and overfitting @xcite .    in comparison , f&l does not assign any prior distributions on hyperparameters and it maximizes the likelihood function over them to infer parameters and compute bayes factor @xcite .",
    "this optimization procedure is only a good approximation when the hyperparameters are precisely determined @xcite . because in this case , the likelihood function on hyperparameters , i.e. , eq .",
    ", is sharply peaked and averaging it over hyperparameters would be approximately equal to maximizing it over hyperparameters . however , gravitational waves searched by pulsar timing arrays are generally very weak , and the hyperparameters are not well measured .",
    "maximizing likelihood function over hyperparameters will significantly overestimate bayes factor and underestimate the parameter uncertainties .",
    "this point is indicated in eq .  , the definition of bayes factor .",
    "the numerator in eq .   will be maximum likelihood if we do not assign any prior distributions and maximize the likelihood function over the hyperparameters as f&l .",
    "the maximum likelihood is always larger than the averaged likelihood over parameters as in eq .  , and the difference will be much greater if the parameters are not precisely measured .",
    "this is the reason why f&l can obtain an incredily huge bayes factor @xmath135 even if the signal is very weak with an amplitude signal - to - noise ratio less than @xmath136 ( see table  2 in @xcite ) .",
