    "the intriguing properties of transition metal oxides have a long history , perhaps starting with the pioneering work of de boer and verwey on systems with partially filled and with completely filled 3d - bands@xcite .",
    "since then , tremendous efforts have been devoted to the study of transition metal oxides , especially in the form of perovskites abo@xmath0 , with a being , e.  g. , la , sr or a mixture of both of them , and b any transition metal . as reviewed by imada _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite , numerous phase transitions have been discovered , especially towards magnetic and superconducting states@xcite , as well as the mott metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "arising in systems with partially filled bands , it points towards the relevance of electronic correlations .",
    "examples are provided by rtio@xmath0 ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) and rnio@xmath0 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) , with r being a rare earth .",
    "furthermore , the colossal magnetoresistance ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) and large thermopower ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) have attracted considerable interest , too .",
    "the transition metal oxides family is richer , and interest in systems exhibiting application - oriented properties immensely grew in recent years .",
    "this is especially true for high - t@xmath1 superconductors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , transparent conducting oxides ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , quantum criticality ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) , and high capacitance heterostructures  @xcite , to quote a few .",
    "in addition , they also entail fascinating phenomena such as superconductivity at the interface of two insulators @xcite , peculiar magnetism in low dimensional systems @xcite , high temperature ferromagnetism in vanadate superlattices @xcite , all of them providing a strong challenge to investigate these systems from the theory side . yet",
    ", one may fairly say that current theoretical approaches meet with severe difficulties when studying the models which describe these systems . indeed ,",
    "the tool which is best mastered ( perturbation theory ) , badly fails when the coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong , thereby calling for alternative approaches .    the microscopic model for interaction driven properties which has received the largest amount of attention is certainly the hubbard model @xcite , especially after anderson s proposal that the key properties of high - t@xmath1 superconductors are embodied in it or in the t - j model @xcite .",
    "the hubbard model describes an interacting many - body system which can not be solved analytically , except for dimension @xmath2@xcite , or in the limit of large spacial dimensions@xcite .    in two dimensions",
    ", consensus has been reached at half - filling only : the interaction strength drives a mott transition@xcite to an insulator with long - ranged antiferromagnetic ( af ) order @xcite .",
    "the consequences of ( hole ) doping remain controversial : the debate focuses on whether the ground - state supports charge inhomogeneities or unconventional fermion - pair condensates and , if so , how their order parameters are intertwined with magnetic properties . even though numerous many - body techniques have been applied , only a partial answer could be obtained . as reviewed in @xcite , they are , e.  g. , cluster extensions @xcite of the dynamical mean - field theory @xcite , the two - particle self - consistent approximation@xcite , gutzwiller variational schemes @xcite , or slave - boson approaches @xcite .",
    "standard quantum monte carlo simulations ( qmc ) are also restricted @xcite owing to the notorious sign problem that is particularly severe for doped hubbard models .",
    "an alternative approach with unrestricted symmetry projected wave - functions has been recently introduced . this symmetry - entangled mean - field",
    "( semf ) theory is variational@xcite , and has been shown to be exact for a two - site cluster , sharing this property with the gutzwiller wave - function ( gwf ) .",
    "in addition , excellent agreement with exact diagonalisation data on @xmath3 clusters has been obtained @xcite .",
    "this then raises the question of whether the semf could be exact for clusters made of more than two sites , which provides the purpose of this paper .",
    "it is organised as follows : we first summarise in section  [ sec : ed ] the exact diagonalisation procedure to the calculation of the ground - state of the hubbard model on a @xmath4 cluster which we determine .",
    "we then present the principles of the semf in section  [ sec : prsemf ] and work out the wave - function obtained after restoration of the spin rotational invariance . for comparison",
    ", we also determine the gutzwiller wave - function as well as the hartree - fock wave - function .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : exa ] we calculate the semf wave - function obtained after spin and total momentum projection , and we show that the exact ground - state energy is recovered for arbitrary interaction strength .",
    "our work is summarised in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this work we consider the hubbard model on four sites @xmath5 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lab ] .",
    "we write the hamiltonian in the form @xmath6 note that the unusual factor @xmath7 for the hopping amplitude is simply introduced to avoid double counting following from the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) we use .",
    "this hamiltonian is invariant under both continuous and discrete symmetry operations .",
    "they involve the @xmath8 spin rotational symmetry , as well as translational symmetry and @xmath9 lattice transformations .",
    "in addition , at half - filling , the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) possesses @xmath8 charge rotational symmetry .",
    "as it turns out that this symmetry is not needed to obtain the exact ground - state in the semf approach , it will be discarded .     cluster . ]    according to previous studies @xcite the ground - state is characterised by zero total spin , zero total momentum and d - wave symmetry . a convenient basis to the calculation of the ground - state may be found starting from a state with two doubly occupied sites that is symmetrised according to the above quantum numbers .",
    "the other basis states are obtained by repeatedly applying the hopping operator .",
    "thus , we end with a three - dimensional subspace spanned by the following vectors : @xmath10 { { | 0 \\rangle}\\xspace}\\nonumber \\\\ { { | 3 \\rangle}\\xspace}&= & \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3 } } \\left [   c^{\\dagger}_{a \\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{b \\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{c \\downarrow } c^{\\dagger}_{d \\downarrow } + c^{\\dagger}_{a \\downarrow } c^{\\dagger}_{b \\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{c \\downarrow } c^{\\dagger}_{d \\uparrow } + c^{\\dagger}_{a \\downarrow } c^{\\dagger}_{b \\downarrow } c^{\\dagger}_{c \\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{d \\uparrow } + c^{\\dagger}_{a \\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{b \\downarrow } c^{\\dagger}_{c \\uparrow } c^{\\dagger}_{d \\downarrow } \\right .",

    "( [ eq : eigszeta ] ) may be solved using cardano s formula , and the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian matrix eq .",

    "the hamiltonian eq .",

    "note that the d - wave character of the ground - state on the @xmath4 cluster maps onto a total momentum @xmath21 for the chain .",
    "then , the solution eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sols]-[eq : solbet ] ) reproduces the results obtained in the 1d case @xcite .",
    "symmetry breaking wave - functions with assumed magnetic , charge or superconducting orders are usually considered in variational treatments of the hubbard model @xcite . however , on finite - size clusters , hamiltonian symmetries must be restored by quantum fluctuations and substantial energy improvements can be obtained by quantum number projection on top of these states .",
    "an illustration with the gutzwiller wave - function can be found in @xcite .",
    "indeed , symmetry restoration leads to coherent superpositions of symmetry related states that induce correlations .",
    "the semf approach follows such a strategy to approximate low - lying eigenstates of the hubbard model . up to now",
    ", the method works at the hartree - fock level and gives the optimal slater determinant minimising the energy _",

    "all symmetries of the hubbard model have revealed an intriguing interplay of spin , charge and pairing correlations in the hole doped region @xcite .",
    "one of the most attractive features of the semf approximation relies on the ability to perform an unbiased energy minimisation , _",
    "i.e. _ to consider totally unrestricted slater determinants . however , we here focus on analytical semf solutions and thus follow conventional calculations with projected wave - functions by constraining the variational subspace to exhibit a relevant order . at half - filling ,",

    "we first limit ourselves to the restoration of spin rotational invariance for which the singlet projection can be achieved by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the euler angles @xmath34 parameterisation of rotations ( with @xmath35 the total spin observable ) .",
    "the unnormalised @xmath36 component of the af state is then easily obtained and may be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 eq .",
    "( [ eq : basis ] ) spanning the subspace of the exact ground - state : @xmath40 indeed , this result reflects unbroken symmetries of the af reference state .",
    "for instance , one can immediately check that @xmath22 is invariant under a spin - rotation around the y - axis by an angle @xmath41 combined with a translation @xmath42 by one lattice spacing along the y - direction .",
    "therefore , after performing all spin rotations and integrating over the euler angles , the resulting @xmath36 vector is simultaneously translational invariant : @xmath43 where we used the hermiticity of the projector eq .",
    "( [ eq : pseq0 ] ) . with the help of the hamiltonian matrix eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmatr ] ) in the subspace @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , one is left with the following average energy @xmath44 in the semf state @xmath45 :    @xmath46    its minimisation with respect to @xmath47 yields a cubic equation for the dimensionless staggered magnetisation @xmath48 : @xmath49 comparison of the resulting energy to the exact solution is performed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ensemf ] .",
    "the agreement is obviously excellent for any on - site interaction , but the semf approach limited to the spin singlet projection is not exact .",
    "let us now proceed to the usual variational calculation with the gutzwiller projector @xmath50 to reduce the weights of configurations with double occupancy in the af reference state .",
    "thus , one aims at minimising : @xmath51 with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath52 . while the evaluation of the norm of the projected wave - function and the expectation value of the interaction energy is straightforward , the one of the kinetic energy is more tedious .",

    "@xmath54    where we have used the invariance of the gutzwiller operator under symmetry transformations of the hamiltonian .",

    "( [ eq : eg ] ) with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath47 reveals that the relative energy difference with the exact solution increases with @xmath56 and saturates to @xmath57 for @xmath58 as shown in fig .",

    "nevertheless , the gutzwiller projection improves the simple hartree - fock approximation which is recovered by imposing the staggered magnetisation @xmath23 to solve the self - consistency condition @xmath59 .",
