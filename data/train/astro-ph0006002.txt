    "every parcel of gas along the line of sight to a distant quasar will selectively absorb certain wavelengths of continuum light of the quasar due to the presence of the various chemical elements in the gas . through the analysis of these quasar absorption lines we can study the spatial distributions , motions , chemical enrichment , and ionization histories of gaseous structures from redshift five until the present .",
    "this includes the gas in galaxies of all morphological types as well as the diffuse gas in the intergalactic medium .",
    "-0.15 in    figure  1 illustrates many of the common features of a quasar spectrum . the relatively flat quasar continuum and broad emission features are produced by the quasar itself ( near the black hole and its accretion disk ) . in some cases , gas near the quasar central engine also produces `` intrinsic '' absorption lines , most notably , and relatively high ionization metal transitions such as , , and .",
    "these intrinsic absorption lines can be broad [ thousands or even tens of thousands of in which case the quasar is called a broad absorption line ( bal ) qso ] , or narrow ( tens to hundreds of ) .",
    "however , the vast majority of absorption lines in a typical quasar spectrum are `` intervening '' , produced by gas unrelated to the quasar that is located along the line of sight between the quasar and the earth .",
    "a structure along the line of sight to the quasar can be described by its neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath0 , the number of atoms per .",
    "@xmath0 is given by the product of the density of the material and the pathlength along the line of sight through the gas .",
    "each structure will produce an absorption line in the quasar spectrum at a wavelength of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the redshift of the absorbing gas and @xmath3   is the rest wavelength of the transition . since @xmath4 , the redshift of the quasar , these absorption lines form a `` forest '' at wavelengths blueward of the emission .",
    "the region redward of the emission will be populated only by absorption through other chemical transitions with longer @xmath5 .",
    "historically , absorption systems with @xmath6   have been called forest lines , those with @xmath7   are lyman limit systems , and those with @xmath8   are damped systems .",
    "the number of systems per unit redshift increases dramatically with decreasing column density , as illustrated in the schematic diagram in figure  2 .",
    "lyman limit systems are defined by a sharp break in the spectrum due to absorption of photons capable of ionizing , i.e. those with energies greater than @xmath9 .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath10 , of the break is given by the product @xmath11 , where the cross section for ionization of hydrogen , @xmath12 , ( and the flux is reduced by the factor @xmath13 ) .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath14 leads to a recovery of the lyman limit break at higher energies ( shorter wavelengths ) , unless @xmath15   ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the curve of growth describes the relationship between the equivalent width of an absorption line , @xmath16 , ( the integral of the normalized profile ) and its column density , @xmath17 . figure  3 shows that for small @xmath0 the number of absorbed photons , and therefore the flux removed , increases in direct proportion to the number of atoms .",
    "this is called the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "as @xmath17 is increased the line saturates so that photons are only absorbed in the wings of the lines ; in this regime the equivalent width is sensitive to the amount of line broadening ( characterized by the doppler parameter @xmath18 ) , but does not depend very strongly on @xmath0 .",
    "this is the flat part of the curve of growth . finally , at @xmath8  , there are enough atoms that the damping wings of the line become populated and the equivalent width increases as the square root of @xmath0 , and is no longer sensitive to @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the ( @xmath19 ) and higher order ( @xmath20 ) lyman series lines , quasar spectra also show absorption due to different ionization states of the various species of metals .",
    "figure  1 illustrates that the damped system at @xmath21 that is responsible for the absorption line at @xmath22   and a lyman limit break at @xmath23   also produces absorption at @xmath24   due to the presence of in the absorbing gas at that same redshift . like",
    "many of the strongest metal lines seen in quasar spectra , is a resonant doublet transition due to transitions from @xmath25 energy levels to the @xmath26 and to the @xmath27 energy levels .",

    "doublet transitions are easy to identify .",
    "the dichotomy between rest wavelength and redshift is resolved because the observed wavelength separation of the doublet members increases as @xmath32 .",

    "the history of quasar absorption lines began within a couple of years of the identification of the first quasar in 1963 . in 1965 ,",
    "gunn and peterson considered the detection of flux blueward of the emission line in the quasar 3c  9 , observed by schmidt , and derived a limit on the amount of neutral hydrogen that could be present in intergalactic space . in that same year , bahcall and salpeter predicted that intervening material should produce observable discrete absorption features in quasar spectra .",
    "such features were detected in 1967 in the quasar pks  @xmath35 by greenstein and schmidt , and in 1968 in phl  @xmath36 by burbidge , lynds , and stockton . by",
    "1969 many intervening systems had been discovered , and bahcall and spitzer proposed that most with metals were produced by the halos of normal galaxies . as more data accumulated , the sheer number of forest lines strongly supported the idea that galactic and intergalactic gas , and not only material intrinsic to the quasar , is the source of most quasar absorption lines . in the 1980",
    "s many more quasar spectra were obtained and many large statistical surveys of the different classes of absorption line systems were published .",
    "the emphasis was to characterize the number of lines per unit redshift , @xmath37 , stronger than some specified equivalent width limit . with 4m  class telescopes [ equipped with charge coupled device ( ccd ) detectors ] it was possible to conduct surveys with a spectral resolution of @xmath38 .",
    "the spectral resolution is defined as @xmath39 , so that @xmath40 corresponds to @xmath41   or @xmath42   at @xmath43   .",
    "separate surveys were conducted for lines , doublets , doublets , and also for lyman limit breaks , all as a function of redshift .",
    "the line is observable in the optical part of the spectrum for @xmath44 , for @xmath45 , for @xmath46 , and the lyman limit break for @xmath47 .",
    "however , a break is also easily identified in lower resolution space  based uv spectra , which extended lyman limit surveys to lower redshift .    in order to consider the cross section of the sky covered by the different populations",
    ", it can be assumed that absorption will be observed for all lines of sight within some radius of every luminous galaxy ( @xmath48 ) .",

    "the higher @xmath0 damped absorbers would be produced within @xmath57  kpc of the center of each galaxy , while the forest lines would require a considerably larger region , hundreds of kpcs around each galaxy to produce a cross section consistent with the observed number of weak lines .",
    "up until the 1990 s , the focus of quasar absorption line work was to separately consider the properties of the individual classes of absorbers ( eg .",
    "forest or absorbers ) . in the 1990 s , however , three different observational advances led to recognition of the direct connections between the different classes of quasar absorption lines , and of direct associations with the population of galaxies :    \\1 .",
    "deep images of quasar fields could be obtained , and redshifts of the galaxies in the field could be determined from low resolution spectra .",
    "steidel found that whenever absorption with @xmath58   is observed , a luminous galaxy ( @xmath59 ) is found within an impact parameter of @xmath60 with a redshift coincident with that determined from the absorption lines . also , it is rare to find a galaxy within this impact parameter that does not produce absorption .",
    "there appears to be a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between strong absorption and luminous galaxies .",
    "the absorbing galaxies span a range of morphological types .",
    ". the high resolution spectrograph on the keck i @xmath61-meter telescope made it possible to obtain quasar spectra at a resolution of @xmath62 , which corresponds to @xmath63  .",
    "the previous surveys with resolution of order hundreds of identified absorption due to entire galaxies and their environments . with @xmath64   resolution it became possible to resolve structure within a galaxy : the clouds in its halo , the interstellar medium of its disk , and the satellites and infalling gas clouds in its environment .",
    "figure  4 is a dramatic illustration of this contrast for the absorber at @xmath65 toward the quasar pg  @xmath66 .",
    "-3.6 in    \\3 .",
    "the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on the hubble space telescope provided resolution @xmath38 in the uv , from @xmath67@xmath68   .",
    "observations of forest clouds could be extended from @xmath69 down to the present epoch .",
    "furthermore , absorption from a given galaxy could be observed in numerous transitions ; if was observed in the optical , the lyman series and could be studied in the uv ( see figure  4 ) . with information on transitions with a range of ionization states , consideration of the degree of ionization ( related to the gas density and the intensity and shape of the ionizing radiation field ) and",
    "the multiple phase structure of galactic gas became possible .",
    "no longer is analysis of absorption lines in quasar spectra an esoteric subject .",
    "it has developed into a powerful tool to be used in the study of galaxy evolution ( eg .",
    "similar to imaging the stellar components of the galaxies ) . at least in principle",
    ", quasar spectra can be used for an unbiased study of the gaseous environments of galaxies from the present back to the highest redshifts at which quasars are observed .",
    "gas structures smaller than @xmath70  @xmath71 can be detected if they are intercepted by the quasar line of sight , irrespective of whether they emit light . through the tool of quasar absorption lines , proto ",
    "galactic structures and low surface brightness galaxies can be studied as well as high luminosity galaxies .",
    "with high resolution spectra of quasars , it is possible to consider the physical conditions of the gaseous structures that produce absorption .",
    "however , it is challenging to separate the various effects that `` shape '' the spectral features in the different chemical transitions .",
    "the absorption profiles observed for the different chemical transitions are determined by a combination of the spatial distribution of material along the line of sight , its bulk kinematics , temperature , metallicity , and abundance pattern .",
    "the ionization structure is influenced by gas densities and by the uv radiation field , which is a combination of the extragalactic background radiation due to the accumulated effect of quasars and stellar photons escaped from galaxies ( and corrected for absorption by the intergalactic medium ) .",
    "the shape of an absorption line can be modeled with a voigt profile , which is a combination of the natural , quantum mechanical lorentzian broadening and the gaussian broadening caused by the thermal and turbulent motions in the gas .",
    "several voigt profiles can be blended together to form an overall complex absorption feature ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "the `` width '' of a single voigt profile is characterized by the doppler parameter , @xmath18 ( expressed in velocity units and related to the gaussian @xmath14 by @xmath72 ) .",
    "physically , the doppler parameter is the sum of thermal and turbulent components , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the temperature of the gas , and @xmath75 is the mass of an atom .",
    "-3.0 in    two of the simplest types of organized kinematics in galaxies are illustrated in figure  5 : clouds distributed in a rotating disk , and radial infall of clouds in a spherical distribution .",
    "here , absorbers are used as an example , but the same kinematic arguments would apply to other transitions . for radial infall , clouds can be distributed over the range of velocities , with a tendency for a `` double peak '' from material that is redshifted and blueshifted but with a considerable amount of variation if there are typically several discrete clouds along the line of sight . a rotating disk with a vertical velocity dispersion characteristic of a spiral galaxy disk ( @xmath61@xmath76  ) will have clouds superimposed in velocity space , and an overall kinematic spread of tens of .",
    "strong absorption has been found to arise along nearly all lines of within @xmath77  kpc of normal galaxies ( i.e. the covering factor is nearly unity within that radius ) .",
    "the large variety of kinematics evident in absorption profiles is , in fact , consistent with a superposition of disk and radial infall ( halo ) motions , and not with just one or the other .",
    "in addition to these simple , toy models , insights can be gleaned by passing lines of sight through the structures in cosmological n  body / hydrodynamic simulations . in a few studies ,",
    "metals have been added uniformly throughout the simulation box and photoionization models used to predict the absorption expected from different structures .",
    "this is especially important for establishing the kinematics that would be observed from the process of structure formation at high redshifts .",
    "consider a cloud of material , modeled by a plane parallel slab with a certain total column density of hydrogen , @xmath78 , and with a constant total number density @xmath79 along the line of sight .",
    "the cloud is also characterized by its metallicity , @xmath80 , which is the ratio of fe / h expressed relative to the solar value , @xmath81 , and by an abundance pattern ( the abundance ratios of all other elements to fe ) .",
    "the degree of ionization in the gas depends upon the intensity and shape of the spectrum of ionizing radiation .",
    "the intensity is characterized by the ionization parameter , @xmath82 , which is the ratio of the number density of photons at the lyman edge to the number density of hydrogen ( @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the total number density of electrons ) .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath85 , the more ionized the gas .",
    "collisional ionization can also be an important process for some absorption systems with gas at high temperatures ( hundreds of thousands of degrees ) .",
    "photoionization equilibrium models typically yield temperatures of tens of thousands of degrees .",
    "once the metallicity , abundance pattern , ionization parameter , and spectral shape are specified the equations of radiative transfer can be solved to find the column densities of all the different ionization states of various chemical elements .",
    "figure  6 illustrates , for @xmath86 and @xmath87  , the dependence of column densities of various transitions on the ionization parameter , @xmath85 . for optically thin gas [ @xmath6  ] ,",
    "the column density ratios of the various metal transitions are not dependent on the overall metallicity , i.e.  the curves shift vertically in proportion to @xmath80 . for optically thick gas , ionization structure develops , with an outer ionized layer around a neutral core , and there is no simple scaling relation with metallicity .    in practice ,",
    "if we assume that a cloud has a simple , single phase structure , the ratios of the column densities can be used to infer the ionization parameter , which relates to the density of the gas .",
    "however , the abundance pattern can differ from the solar abundance pattern because of differing degrees of depletion onto dust , or because of different processing histories .",
    "most of the so  called @xmath88 particle nuclei ( such as mg and si ) are synthesized primarily by type ii supernovae during the early history of a galaxy when most massive stars form and quickly evolve to reach their end states . on the other hand , the fe ",
    "group elements are primarily produced by type ia supernovae , and therefore build up over a longer timescale . in the basic picture of galaxy evolution ,",
    "the halo stars are formed early , have been enriched only by type ii supernova , and therefore are @xmath88element enhanced .",
    "younger disk stars have incorporated also the type ia processed material and therefore have relatively larger fe  group abundances . ideally , several different ionization states of the same chemical element are observed so that there is no ambiguity between the ionization parameter and the abundance pattern , but this has generally not yet been possible because of limited wavelength coverage at high resolution .",
    "examples of the variation of column density ratios with velocity in two absorption systems are shown in figures  [ fig : fig7 ] and [ fig : fig8 ] . in figure 7 , @xmath89 varies by an order of magnitude over the four components in the @xmath90 system toward the quasar q@xmath91 .",
    "this represents a variation of an order of magnitude in the ionization parameter ( @xmath92 ) , or an order of magnitude variation in the abundance pattern .",
    "figure  8 is a very unusual system with two clouds separated by only @xmath76   in velocity , one of which has a silicon to aluminum ratio similar to the milky way ism , and the other which requires a significant enhancement of aluminum .",
    "the gaseous component of the the milky way and nearby galaxies have phase structure ( i.e.  spatial locations with different densities and/or temperatures ) .",
    "examples are the disk / halo interface ( galactic coronae ) and the cold , warm , and hot phases of the interstellar medium . from photoionization models , it is not usually possible to generate absorption that is simultaneously consistent with all observed chemical transitions for a given system .",
    "for example , in single cloud systems , figure  6 ( with @xmath86  ) shows that if is detected at a similar column density to , the ionization parameter must be small , and @xmath93 can not be large .",
    "many systems have absorption which exceeds this limit and requires a higher ionization ( lower density ) phase ; generally , this phase must have structure over a large velocity range ( a large `` effective '' doppler parameter ) .",
    "the @xmath65 system toward the quasar pg  1206 + 459 is another case that requires multiphase structure .",
    "the observed profile in figure  4 is much too strong for this absorption to arise in the same clouds that produce the , even if their ionization parameters are pushed to the largest values consistent with the data .",
    "future quasar absorption line studies will combine insights gained from detailed analyses of individual systems with conclusions drawn from the large statistical samples assembled over cosmic time .",
    "evolution of the ensemble of absorption profiles generated by the universal collective of intervening structures is a result of the combined effects of numerous processes .",
    "these include growth of structure , star formation , morphological evolution of galaxies , galaxy mergers , and changes in the extragalactic background radiation . here , we summarize the best present statistical data and likely interpretations for the different classes of absorbers . the number of lines per unit redshift for various populations of absorbers is represented by a power law @xmath94 . for a universe with only the cosmological evolution due to expansion , @xmath95 for deceleration parameter @xmath96 and @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "-0.5 in    the forest evolves away dramatically from high to low redshift , as is strikingly clear from the spectra of @xmath99 and @xmath100 quasars in figure  9 .",
    "the evolution of the lines with @xmath101   can be characterized by a double power law with @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "help in understanding the physical picture has come from sophisticated n  body / hydrodynamic simulations that incorporate the gas physics and consider cosmological expansion of the simulation box .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the gas can be described as outflow from the centers of voids to their surrounding shells , and flows along these sheets toward their intersections where the densest structures form .",
    "this picture is consistent with observational determinations of the `` sizes '' of structures .",
    "it is difficult to obtain direct measurements of sizes except in some special cases to use `` double lines of sight '' , close quasar pairs , either physical or apparent due to gravitational lensing .",
    "if the spectra of the two quasars both have a absorption line at the same wavelength that implies a `` structure '' which covers both lines of sight . from these studies , it is found that `` structures '' are at least hundreds of kpc in extent .    at redshifts",
    "@xmath106 to @xmath107 @xmath37 for forest absorption is quite large , but it is declining very rapidly over that range .",
    "this dramatic evolution in the number of forest clouds is mostly due to the expansion of the universe , with a modest contribution from structure growth . at @xmath108 ,",
    "the extragalactic background radiation field is falling , and structures are becoming more neutral .",
    "therefore , the more numerous , smaller @xmath109 structures are observed at a larger @xmath0 and this will counteract the effect of expansion , thus slowing the decline of the forest .    the high redshift forest was once thought to be primordial material , but in fact it is observed to have a metallicity of @xmath110% solar , even at @xmath111 . for @xmath112  ,",
    "the expected @xmath113 would be below the detection thresholds of current observations , so truly pristine material still eludes us .",
    "perhaps it does not exist . to spread metals all through the intergalactic medium",
    "may have required a `` pre  galactic '' population of stars at @xmath114 that polluted all of intergalactic space .",
    "the @xmath37 of lyman limit systems is consistent with that of strong absorbers [ with @xmath58   ] over the redshift range for which both have been observed , @xmath45 . for @xmath58   , @xmath115 ,",

    "those with strong are constrained to be smaller than 10  pc ( the ionization parameter must be small and @xmath84 large as can be seen in figure  6 ) . also ,",
    "since fe is produced primarily by type ia supernovae they must be enriched by a relatively old stellar population .",
    "those with weaker or undetected could be larger ( kpcs or tens of kpcs ) and possibly enriched by type ii supernovae .",

    "another important trend is the fact that the very strongest absorbers evolve away from @xmath107 until the present .",

    "however , this signature is not unique .",
    "it could also be the consequence of directed infall in an hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
