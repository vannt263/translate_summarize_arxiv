    "spin noise spectroscopy ( sns ) , primarily demonstrated on atomic systems @xcite , has recently gained popularity mainly due to its application to semiconductor structures , with respect to which this technique proved to be most efficient  @xcite .",
    "the basis of the sns is provided by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , which implies possibility of detecting resonances of linear susceptibility of the medium without its excitation , by `` listening '' to a noise of the medium in its equilibrium state .",
    "as applied to magnetic resonance spectroscopy , this possibility can be realized by detecting fluctuations of the faraday rotation for a probe beam passing through a transparent ( at the probe wave frequency ) paramagnet in a magnetic field directed across the light beam propagation direction .",
    "this fluctuations are proportional to the fluctuations of the media magnetization . in this configuration ,",
    "the faraday rotation noise spectrum reveals a peak at the magnetic resonance frequency corresponding to the precession of spontaneous fluctuations of the spin ensemble at the larmor frequency . since this technique , unlike conventional electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectroscopy",
    ", does not imply an excitation of the resonance , it was considered to be essentially nonperturbative . along with this property , which was initially regarded as the most important merit of sns",
    ", the new technique has revealed a number of capabilities inaccessible either to conventional esr spectroscopy , or even to linear optical spectroscopy in general ( see , e.g. , refs .   for details ) . in particular , it allows one to make esr measurements in a wide range of frequencies extending far beyond the bandwidth of optical detectors ( up to thz ) with no special microwave equipment , to identify statistics of the spin carriers , to perform three - dimensional tomographic measurements with a fairly high spatial resolution , to penetrate inside inhomogeneously broadened bands .",
    "a highly important advancement of the sns was related to an advent of the fourier - transform - based technique of spin noise ( sn ) detection , which has dramatically improved the sensitivity of the method  @xcite , making it possible , for instance , to measure spin noise of a single spin @xcite or to detect nuclear spin fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "thanks to all these opportunities and in combination with almost nonperturbative character of the measuring procedure , the sns has made it possible to perform many fascinating experiments , see ref .   for review , and thus has turned , nowadays , into a highly useful and , in many respects , unique method of research in the field of magnetic resonance and spin dynamics in semiconductors .",
    "application of the sns to semiconductors and , in particular , to semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wells and quantum dots requires an increase of the polarimetric sensitivity of the method .",
    "it can be achieved either by direct increase of the probe beam power  @xcite or by placing the sample inside a fabry - perot cavity  @xcite . in these studies , it became clear that , in practice , sns can not remain perfectly nonperturbative .",
    "this fact , although hinders nonperturbative measurements , may be useful for studying dynamics of non - equilibrium spin systems and thus provide the basis of the nonlinear sns .",
    "examples of the nonlinear sns have already been given by the experimental studies  @xcite in which the effects of probe beam intensity on the detected spin noise spectra were noticed .",
    "especially spectacular example of the nonlinear sns has been reported in the recent work  @xcite , where the elliptically polarized probe beam in the region of nominal transparency of the sample ( @xmath0-doped gaas ) has made it possible to optically orient the host lattice nuclear spin system of the semiconductor in the voigt geometry .",
    "this is possible if additional fields , besides external one , affect either electron or nuclear spin systems  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the electron spin noise ( sn ) spectra at arbitrary orientation of the external magnetic field generally reveal two components  @xcite .",
    "one of them is centered at zero frequency and reflects fluctuations of the longitudinal ( with respect to the applied magnetic field ) magnetization , while the other , at larmor frequency , results from fluctuations of the transverse magnetization .",
    "relative contributions of these two components are controlled by mutual orientation of the light beam and magnetic field and therefore can be used to monitor direction of the effective magnetic field acting upon the spin system under particular experimental conditions .    in this paper",
    ", we use the spin noise spectroscopy to study mechanisms of nonlinear interaction of elliptically polarized probe light of sub - bandgap energy with electron spin system of the @xmath0-gaas crystal .",
    "the main attention is devoted to an analysis of properties of the effective field , termed hereafter as _ optical _ magnetic field , created by circularly polarized component of the probe beam and revealed in a highly spectacular form in the spin noise spectrum of the sample .",
    "we discuss possible origin of the optical field and demonstrate that it most likely results from the probe - helicity - dependent optical stark effect relevant at high power densities of the electromagnetic field inside the microcavity even for the medium transparent at the appropriate wavelength .",
    "a theory of such an effect for bulk microcavities is developed .",
    "in our studies we used sample t695 , which , like the one used in ref .",
    ", was a 3@xmath1/2-layer of @xmath0-type gaas embedded into a graded high - q ( quality factor @xmath2 ) microcavity .",
    "bragg mirrors of the sample were made of gaas / alas , rather than algaas / gaas  @xcite , pairs of layers .",
    "this allowed us to obtain approximately the same @xmath3-value of the cavity as in ref .   with smaller number of layers : 25 and 17 pairs for the first and second mirrors ( starting from the side of substrate ) .",
    "the room - temperature doping @xmath4 @xmath5 is slightly above the point of insulator - to - metal transition of the gaas and provides the longest spin relaxation times  @xcite .",
    "the detected spin noise is provided by electrons with energies in the vicinity of the fermi level since ( i ) the magnitude of the sn grows linearly with temperature ( the behavior typical for free electrons in gaas @xcite ) and ( ii ) the precession peak in the sn spectrum corresponds to the electron larmor frequency in gaas with the @xmath6-factor @xmath7 ( see below for details ) .    magnetic resonance in the kerr - rotation noise spectrum was detected in the conventional voigt configuration ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "magnetic fields up to 0.7  t and low temperatures down to 3  k were created by the montana cryostation system with magneto - optic module .",
    "the output emission of a continuous wave ti : sapphire laser `` t&d - scan '' tuned to the cavity photon mode ( usually close to @xmath8 nm ) was used as a probe .",
    "the beam was focused to a spot of about @xmath9  @xmath10 m in diameter on the sample surface .",
    "polarization noise of the beam , reflected from the sample in nearly autocollimation geometry , was detected by a balanced photoreceiver with the bandwidth @xmath11 220 mhz and processed with a broadband fft spectrum analyzer . as a result , the measured signal @xmath12 was proportional to the frequency spectrum of kerr rotation angle fluctuation @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath14 and electron spin fluctuation @xmath15 are directly proportional , we obtain @xmath16 hereafter , we use the coordinate frame with the @xmath17- and @xmath18-axes being , respectively , the light propagation direction and the axis of the transverse magnetic field .    as compared with standard sns configuration ,",
    "the experimental set - up was modified to simultaneously use the probe beam as the circularly polarized pump . a quarter - wave plate introduced into the linearly polarized beam for this purpose allowed us to control the light ellipticity . besides , in some cases , we applied to the sample an additional magnetic field of several tens of mt directed along the light beam propagation axis to increase the pumping efficiency . for this purpose",
    ", we usually employed a permanent magnet .",
    "we emphasize that the wavelength of the probe @xmath19  nm beam corresponds to the region of nominal transparency of the sample , @xmath20 , where @xmath21  nm is the wavelength corresponding to the fundamental absorption edge of gaas .",
    "thus , the nonlinear effects in the sns of the microcavity sample observed at relatively low intensities of the probe beam arise due to high power density of the light field inside the high - q microcavity .     1 s. ]    there are two types of the light - induced nonlinear effects in this system : those with temporaly retarded response related to dynamic nuclear spin polarization and their spin dynamics uncovered in ref .   and those appearing instantaneously within accessible time resolution , see below , and related , in particular , to optical magnetic field .",
    "effects of the first type , as has been reported in @xcite , are revealed in the most pronounced way after keeping the sample in the longitudinal magnetic field in the presence of circularly polarized probe beam . under these conditions ,",
    "nuclear system of the sample in the microcavity is efficiently oriented optically , and dynamics of the relaxing nuclear system evidenced via overhauser field - induced time - dependent shift of the sn peak can be directly observed in temporal dynamics of the sn spectrum in the voigt geometry .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows example of such dynamics obtained in this way with our sample .",
    "the slow ( retarded ) response of the sn spectrum is observed as a drift of the precession peak in the field of relaxing nuclear spin system with characteristic times @xmath22 150  200 s. presented results well correlate with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained on another sample , differing from them by inessential for our purposes numerical values of the sn power and width of the electron spin resonance peak .",
    "the right and left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] correspond to the signs of circular polarization and longitudinal magnetic field being the same or opposite .",
    "the faint peaks in the spectrum , which are practically time - independent are most probably related to a small unintentional doping of the first few layers in the bragg mirrors .",
    "the nuclear spins in the barriers are weakly polarized and their spin dynamics is expected to be faster , hence the spin precession of these electrons is almost unaffected by the overhauser field .",
    "these effects are beyond the scope of the present paper .    the effect of the retarded optical response , associated with nuclear spin dynamics , can be also observed in the voigt geometry with no longitudinal magnetic field just by switching probe beam polarization to elliptical and back to linear . in this case , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we can observe dynamics of both nuclear spin polarization and nuclear spin relaxation .",
    "is the external _ transverse _ magnetic field and @xmath23 is the _ longitudinal _ magnetic field , which may be created either by external permanent magnet or by circularly polarized probe beam .",
    "( b ) sn spectra obtained at fixed transverse magnetic field @xmath24 for the longitudinal field @xmath23 being on and off .",
    "blue lines show the fit of the experimental data , see the text for details ( 0.7 mt , indicated at the figure , is the residual longitudinal magnetic field derived from the fitting ) . ]      in addition to the retarded response , already addressed both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite and lying beyond the scope of this paper , the time - resolved sn spectrum contains a stepwise jump , occuring simultaneously with switching ellipticity of the probe beam ( @xmath25 ) on and off .",
    "this instantaneous response is revealed as appearance or vanishing of the peak at @xmath26 with simultaneous shift of the precession peak to higher or lower frequencies , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "exactly the same effect can be achieved in experiments with additional magnetic field if @xmath23 is abruptly switched on or off . therefore , switching of the ellipticity @xmath25 is equivalent to an instantaneous change of the longitudinal magnetic field acting upon the electron spins .",
    "experimentally , the retarded and instantaneous effects can be easily separated by making rapid measurements with accumulation times much shorter that that of nuclear spin relaxation .",
    "time resolution of our setup ( @xmath27  @xmath10s ) did not allow us to address the timescale of instantaneous response and , thus , to find out whether this effect is formed on the timescale relevant for electron spin dynamics ( @xmath22  ns ) or on subpicosecond scale relevant for optical transitions .",
    "hence , to prove that the instant modifications of the sn spectrum result from the effective optical field acting on electron spin we rely on magnetometric capacity of the sns .",
    "it is based on the fact that the magnetic field components aligned across ( @xmath24 ) and along ( @xmath23 ) the light beam propagation contribute essentially different to the sn spectrum .",
    "we recall that the sn spectrum in eq .   in the presence of a magnetic field , containing , along with transverse component @xmath24 , the longitudinal one",
    "@xmath23 takes the form  @xcite : @xmath28\\cos^2{\\varphi}\\\\          + \\frac{\\pi n_e}{2}\\delta_{t_1}(\\omega)\\sin^2{\\varphi}.      \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , @xmath29 is the density of fluctuating spins , for free electrons @xmath30 d\\varepsilon$ ] , with @xmath31 being the density of states including contributions from two spin branches and @xmath32 being the distribution function  @xcite , @xmath33 is the angle between the magnetic field and @xmath18-axis , @xmath34 , the electron spin precession frequency is @xmath35 , @xmath6 is the electron @xmath6-factor , @xmath36 is the bohr magneton , @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 is the longitudinal electron - spin relaxation time , and @xmath40 is the transverse electron spin relaxation time . in eq .  , the equilibrium magnetization of electrons in the field @xmath41 , as well as optically induced spin polarization , are disregared .",
    "formula   describes a known result that , in the general case , the sn spectrum consists of two components : the one centered at magnetic resonance frequency @xmath42 , often referred to as _",
    "magnetic _ peak and the one centered at zero frequency and called _ nonmagnetic_. spectral position of the magnetic component @xmath42 is governed by the absolute value of the total magnetic field @xmath41 , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , while the relative magnitude of the nonmagnetic component contains information about orientation of @xmath41 and about its longitudinal component @xmath23 .",
    "this type of behavior is illustrated by the two experimental sn spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) obtained , respectively , in pure voigt geometry and in the presence of an additional static magnetic field @xmath43 created with a permanent magnet .",
    "one can see both the appearance of the nonmagnetic ( zero - frequency ) component in the presence of @xmath23 and a shift of the magnetic peak to higher frequencies . by fitting experimental data with eq .",
    ", one obtains corresponding values of the external magnetic field thus confirming reliability of the method .",

    "% ) of different intensity and ( b ) dependence of nonmagnetic component seen in panel ( a ) on the light beam power , dashed line is the fit after eq .  .",
    "]        these magnetometric abilities of the sns are revealed in a much more spectacular and nontrivial way in our present experiments with elliptically polarized probe . using the sn - based magnetometry",
    ", we observed an effective magnetic field ( _ optical field _ ) produced by circularly polarized probe beam in the @xmath0-gaas microcavity .",
    "experimental results presented in fig .  [ fig:4 ] illustrate what happens when we use an elliptically polarized probe beam instead of the beam polarized linearly .",
    "such a configuration allows one to measure the sn spectrum in the light field with a specified helicity and , thus , to use the light beam both as a linearly polarized probe and as a circularly polarized pump .",
    "these measurements were performed fast enough , so that slow processes of nuclear spin orientation and relaxation could not contribute to results of the measurements .",
    "one can see that , with increasing intensity of the elliptically polarized probe beam , there arises the zero - frequency component of the sn spectrum .",
    "it serves as a direct evidence of presence of longitudinal component of the effective magnetic field acting on electron spins . at the same time , the magnetic component shifts to higher frequencies .",
    "again , the experimental data can be fitted by eq .   with reasonable accuracy .",
    "insignifical discrepacy between the experimental and calculated data may result from non - uniformity of the light spot .",
    "example of such a comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . using eq .",
    ", we can roughly estimate this field as @xmath46 mt for the probe beam power @xmath47 mw and circular polarization degree @xmath48 .",
    "phenomenological features of the instantaneous response demonstrate fairly convincingly that it is related to light - induced modification of the magnetic field acting upon the fluctuating electron spins , rather than to light - induced changes of the electron - spin properties .",
    "the properties and nature of this _ optical _ field @xmath49 are discussed in the next section .",
    "the optical field revealed in our sns experiments shows certain features that look nontrivial and deserve special attention . in this section ,",
    "we discuss these specific features and propose a theoretical model for the optical field .",
    "first of all , the optical field is mainly directed along the light propagation ( @xmath17 ) axis , see sec .",
    "[ sec : exper ] , and changes its sign with reversal of the probe beam helicity .",
    "the latter was checked by compensating the optical field by a longitudinal field of a permanent magnet .",
    "second characteristic feature of the optical field is that there is no noticeable time delay between the stepwise jump in polarization of the probe and corresponding change of the sn signal .",
    "as has been shown in our additional measurements , the response of the sn signal to polarization of the probe , within our instrumental precision ( @xmath50s ) , was instantaneous . in any case",
    ", the effect of nuclear spin system in formation of optical field @xmath49 can be safely disregarded .",
    "thus , there are basically two options for the origin of the optical field",
    ". it could be either caused by ( i ) some electron spin system or by ( ii ) electromagnetic radiation itself .",
    "let us examine these options in more detail .",
    "we note that although the interaction between electrons is spin dependent , the electrons probed by the sns can not be responsible for the optical field .",
    "this follows from the larmor theorem which states that the spin resonance frequency is not renormalized by the electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "deviations from the larmor theorem can be observable only in low - dimensional semiconductor systems with spin - anisotropic interactions and , as a rule , are minor  @xcite .",
    "hence , there could only be a contribution from some other electron ensemble , i.e. , from electrons localized at donor pairs  @xcite or from photogenerated holes .",
    "-factor on the probe beam power .",
    "]    however , the optical magnetic field is produced , in our experiments , by the light with the photon energies below the gaas bandgap , which corresponds to the region of nominal transparency of the system .",
    "we note also that the microcavity @xmath3-factor does not show any noticeable changes with the light power ,  fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "although some absorption of light should take place to enable optical orientation of electron spins and dynamic nuclear polarization  @xcite , two additional spin systems mentioned above ( localized electrons and photoholes ) have very short spin lifetimes , typically @xmath51  ps  @xcite , as compared with @xmath52  ns spin lifetimes for free electrons in our sample , and , thus , spin polarization of these spin systems should be negligible .",
    "even if there is some electronic spin sub - system , in our sample , with sufficiently long spin lifetime ( @xmath53  ns ) to provide sizeable polarization , the external transverse field @xmath24 should suppress its spin @xmath17-component due to hanle effect and , at the same time , give rise to the other transverse component @xmath54 .",
    "the experiment has shown , however , that this is not the case : optical field @xmath23 obtained from the fitting of data is independent on @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ fig:4](b ) presents experimental dependence of the nonmagnetic peak area on intensity of the _ elliptically _ polarized probe beam ( @xmath55 ) at a fixed value of the external transverse magnetic field @xmath56 .",
    "this dependence completely coincides with our theoretical predictions for the optical field , see below , and , thus , makes it possible to quantitatively evaluate , with sufficiently high accuracy , magnitude of this field .",
    "indeed , it follows from eq .   that the ratio of the area of nonmagnetic component @xmath57 of the sn spectrum to the total area @xmath58 is simply given by  @xcite @xmath59 taking into account that the optical field is parallel to @xmath17 axis , and that its magnitude is proportional to both incident light helicity , @xmath60 , and intensity , @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total light power in the illuminated spot , with @xmath64 being the area the spot , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are constants . making use of the fact that @xmath24 is just the external field and fitting the data in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](b ) by eq",
    ".   we obtain @xmath67  mt / mw  @xcite or @xmath68 thus , we can make an important conclusion , that neither the magnitude , nor the direction of the optical field are affected by the transverse field @xmath24 ( at least for @xmath69  mt ) .",
    "irradiation of the quantum systems in the transparency region results in the renormalization of the electron energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this class of effects is known as _ ac _ or _ dynamic _ stark effects , see ref .   for brief review .",
    "particularly , circularly polarized radiation results in the effective zeeman splitting of electron spin states , sometimes referred to as _ ac _",
    "zeeman effect  @xcite .",
    "the effect of circularly polarized light can be thus considered as the generation of the effective _ optical _ magnetic field , just like the propagation of circularly polarized light in transparent media results in its magnetization , termed as inverse faraday effect  @xcite . by symmetry reasons in cubic crystals like gaas ( @xmath70 point symmetry group ) this effective magnetic field",

    "<S> phys . lett . * 106 * , 242405 ( 2015 ) ] has arisen a number of questions , the main of them concerning mechanisms of angular momentum transfer from the light to the nuclear spin system and the nature of the light - related magnetic fields accompanying the optical nuclear polarization . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use the spin noise spectroscopy for magnetometric purposes , particularly , to study effective fields acting upon electron spin system of an @xmath0-gaas layer inside a high - q microcavity in the presence of elliptically polarized probe beam . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the external magnetic field applied to the sample in the voigt geometry and the overhauser field created by optically oriented nuclei , the spin noise spectrum reveals an additional effective , `` optical '' , magnetic field produced by elliptically polarized probe itself . </S>",
    "<S> this field is directed along the light propagation axis , with its sign being determined by the sign of the probe helicity and its magnitude depending on degree of circular polarization and intensity of the probe beam . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze properties of this optical magnetic field and suggest that it results from the optical stark effect in the field of the elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave . </S>"
