    "in recent years massive mimo ( mmimo ) has attracted considerable attention as a candidate for the fifth generation physical layer technology @xcite,@xcite .",
    "cell - free mmimo is a particular deployment of mmimo systems with a network of randomly - located large number of single - antenna aps , where the geographical area is not partitioned into cells and each user is served simultaneously by all of the aps @xcite,@xcite .",
    "some of the advantages and limitations of the networks with distributed aps can be found in @xcite . in particular in",
    "[ 3 ] , [ 4 ] the performance of downlink transmission and uplink transmission with mf receiver in cell - free mmimo systems have been studied . in this paper",
    "we first consider uplink mmse receiver .",
    "we further propose a suboptimal mmse receiver called _ partial mmse _ and demonstrate that it has virtually optimal performance .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study uplink performance of cellular mmimo systems with distributed antenna clusters in each cell .",
    "the authors consider mmse and mf receivers with coordination among distributed antenna clusters in each cell .",
    "in contrast we assume all distributed aps coordinate with each other to form the postcoding vectors and detect the signals transmitted by users . in @xcite",
    "random matrix theory results are used to study performance of cellular mmimo systems .",
    "motivated by @xcite we applied random matrix theory for deriving a tight approximation of the partial mmse in cell - free systems as a function of large scale fading coefficients with cooperation among distributed aps . since partial mmse has almost optimal performance , our approximation is also very accurate for the optimal mmse receiver .",
    "numerical results indicate that the obtained approximation is accurate even for a small number of aps and users .    in @xcite and @xcite , lsfd (",
    "also known as pilot contamination postcoding ) was proposed for interference reduction in cellular mmimo systems .",
    "in lsfd base stations cooperate , but only using large scale fading coefficients . in this work",
    "we propose generalization of the lsfd receiver for cell - free mmimo systems and derive the sinr expression for it as a function of large scale fading coefficients .",
    "we further derive an expression for sinr of cell - free systems with mf receiver in the regime when the number of users is constant and the number of aps grows without a limit .",
    "our result shows that in this regime the system performance is limited by the coherent interference resulting from two or more users sharing the same pilot sequence .    in numerical experiments",
    "we evaluate the system performance under independent and correlated shadow fading models .",
    "results show that mmse and lsfd receivers provide significant gain over mf receiver .",
    "mmse receiver outperforms lsfd receiver while the latter has smaller complexity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section : system_model ] the system model and channel estimation",
    "are described . in section [ section :",
    "uplink_data ] , we investigate mmse , partial mmse , and lsfd receivers in uplink transmission . finally , numerical results are presented in section [ section : simulations ] .    throughout the paper @xmath1",

    "we consider a geographical area with @xmath12 randomly distributed single - antenna aps and @xmath13 single antenna users , assuming that @xmath14 .",
    "all aps are connected to a network controller ( nc ) via an unspecified backhaul network .",
    "all aps and users are perfectly synchronized in time .",
    "the channel coefficient between ap @xmath15 and user @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the large scale fading coefficient which accounts for path loss and shadow fading and @xmath19 is the small scale fading coefficient .",
    "the large scale fading coefficients change slowly over time and assumed to be known at the nc .",
    "the small scale fading coefficients are i.i.d .",
    "random variables that stay constant over a channel coherence interval .",
    "we assume time - division duplex ( tdd ) protocol , i.e. , all users synchronously send randomly assigned orthonormal pilot sequences ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 ) to allow aps to estimate channel coefficients , which they further send to the nc .",
    "we consider short coherence interval ( due to high user mobility ) and therefore @xmath22 is small and @xmath23 .",
    "hence each pilot is reused by several users , which results in the pilot contamination , @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a greedy pilot assignment scheme in cell - free systems has been introduced which is shown to improve performance of cell - free system compared with the random pilot assignment scheme . however , for simplicity we consider the random pilot assignment in the cell - free systems .",
    "all users are partitioned into @xmath22 sets @xmath24 in a way that users in @xmath25 use pilot @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the index of the pilot sequence transmitted by th @xmath28th user .",
    "the received signal in the first step of the tdd protocol at the @xmath15th ap is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the uplink transmit power of each user and @xmath31 is additive gaussian noise .",
    "ap @xmath15 computes the mmse estimate of @xmath32 as @xmath33 it can be verified that @xmath34 and the channel estimation error @xmath35 are uncorrelated gaussian random variables with distributions @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 for every @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it is enough for ap @xmath15 to choose one user @xmath40 and send only the channel estimates @xmath41 to the nc .",
    "let @xmath42 denote the power coefficient used by the @xmath28th user to transmit uplink data .",
    "for notation convenience we define @xmath43",
    "at the second step of the tdd protocol , users send data symbols and the @xmath15th ap receives @xmath44 where @xmath45 is additive noise and @xmath46 is the data signal transmitted by the @xmath28th user .",
    "the nc uses estimates @xmath34 to form postcoding vectors @xmath47 and obtains estimates of data signals @xmath48^t,~k=1,\\cdots , k$ ] . using the worst - case uncorrelated additive noise ,",
    "the uplink achievable rate of the @xmath16th user is @xmath49 , with @xmath50 where @xmath51^t$ ] .",
    "note that achievable sinr of the @xmath16th user in ( [ eq : sinr ] ) is obtained by taking into account the channel estimation error and pilot contamination effect .",
    "first , we consider mmse receiver , which maximizes sinr of each user .",
    "the mmse vector of the @xmath16th user is given by @xmath52 note that the mmse vector in ( [ eq : opt ] ) contains channel estimates of all users in the network .",
    "thus , it is optimal in the sense that it maximizes sinr of each user .",
    "whereas in cellular systems , the mmse vector at cell @xmath53 only contains channel vectors of cell @xmath53 and the second - order statistics of the channel coefficients between base station at cell @xmath53 and all users in the network @xcite .",
    "achievable sinr of the @xmath16th user with mmse receiver is given by @xmath54    the monte carlo simulation of @xmath55 requires long averaging over small scale fading coefficients @xmath56 .",
    "hence it is desirable to have an approximation of @xmath57 as a function of large scale fading coefficients only .",
    "the correlation between the channel estimates ( i.e. , @xmath38 for @xmath39 ) does not allow us to use random matrix theory tools ( ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1,2),@xcite ) to achieve this goal .",
    "below we propose a _ partial mmse _ receiver",
    "whose performance is very close to the performance of the mmse receiver and allows us to overcome this problem .",
    "let @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the index of a user from @xmath25 whose selection rule is discussed later . the partial mmse vector for user @xmath16",
    "is then defined by @xmath60 where @xmath61 note that @xmath62 contains all users that cause coherence interference to user @xmath16 and one user from each non - coherent interference group @xmath63 .",
    "note that in mmimo systems , the coherent interference is the dominant impairment which limits the system performance when number of antennas increase without bound .",
    "therefore , in the partial mmse receiver we include channel vectors of all users that use the same pilot sequence as user @xmath16 .",
    "the users @xmath64 should be chosen such that vectors @xmath65 in  ( [ eq : subopt ] ) have the major contribution in  ( [ eq : opt ] ) and hence ( [ eq : subopt ] ) becomes close to ( [ eq : opt ] ) .",
    "numerical results show that a random selection of users @xmath64 from the corresponding sets @xmath24 leads to poor performance ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "a method for smart choice of these users can be formulated as following @xmath66 where @xmath67^t$ ] . in other words ,",
    "we choose user @xmath59 that is in the close vicinity of the @xmath16th user .",
    "the @xmath68 can be obtained by substituting @xmath69 in ( [ eq : sinr ] ) .    in the following theorem",
    "we apply random matrix theory to obtain an asymptotic approximation of @xmath70 when @xmath12 and @xmath13 grow infinitely large while the ratio @xmath71 is finite .",
    "this asymptotic result is used as an approximation for finite values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 similar to @xcite and @xcite in which the approximations are derived for miso broadcast channel and cellular systems respectively .    [",

    "the main idea of lsfd is that only large scale fading coefficients are transmitted to nc from aps .",

    "we can show that the optimal @xmath127 which maximizes sinr of each user is given by @xmath128 the associated sinr of the @xmath16th user is given by @xmath129 to obtain power coefficients one can apply max - min power allocation problem with per user transmit power constraints as following    [ eq : maxmin ] @xmath130    the objective function @xmath131 in ( [ eq : maxmin_sinr ] ) is a quasiconcave function of @xmath132^t$ ] and constraints ( [ eq : maxmin_constraints ] ) are convex .",
    "since the power allocation problem ( [ eq : maxmin ] ) is quasiconcave , bisection method ( * ? ? ?",
