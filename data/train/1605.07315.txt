    "usually , the reflection probability @xmath0 of a particle of zero ( extremely low ) energy incident on a one - dimensional potential which converges to zero asymptotically is found to be 1 : @xmath1 , the single dirac delta and the square well potentials are the simplest examples [ 1 - 6 ] .",
    "this observation is also intuitive , for a zero - energy particle the tunnel effect is negligible such that the transmission probability is close to zero .",
    "earlier , a paradoxical phenomenon that @xmath2 has been proposed and proved as a threshold anomaly [ 7 ] for a potential which is at the threshold of binding a state at @xmath7 this paradoxical result may be understood in terms of wave packet scattering from an attractive potential .",
    "a wave packet with zero average kinetic energy , localized to one side of the potential , will spread in both directions .",
    "when the low energy components scatter against the potential , they are transmitted and this would appear simply as wave packet spreading preferentially to the other direction .    here we show that it is rather a critical effect which occurs when a scattering potential well becomes critical : possesses a half bound state ( hbs ) at @xmath8 .",
    "we extend the concept of hbs to one dimension .",
    "hbs is discussed [ 1 - 3,8 ] in low energy scattering from a three dimensional central potential in terms of scattering length . in two analytically solvable models ,",
    "we show that both hbs at @xmath8 and @xmath9 occurs when an effective parameter @xmath5 of the potential takes a critical discrete value @xmath4 .",
    "however in numerical calculation of even these two models , we show that @xmath2 is achieved as an extrapolation from low energies to zero energy that too when @xmath5 equals @xmath4 very accurately . in this regard ,",
    "very low reflection at very low energies is no less surprising and we show that it is plausible and it could even be more practical than @xmath2 .",

    "it has been shown [ 9 ] that when the depth of a potential is increased , @xmath24 varies from positive to negative and _ vice versa _ by becoming discontinuous ( @xmath25 ) at certain discrete values say @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , @xmath28 is very large , then by increasing the depth @xmath29 slightly the potential can be made to possess a weakly bound state at an energy slightly below @xmath8 .",

    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be the distances where @xmath50 is extremely small .",
    "we propose to give the condition for hbs at @xmath8 as @xmath54 in contrast to the bound states , hbs do not vanish asymptotically ; they instead saturate to become constant ( parallel ) there ( see figs . , 1,2 ) . a slight increase ( decrease ) in depth of the well",

    "the conditions for hbs are @xmath56 if @xmath50 is not symmetric , we have hbs at @xmath8 such that @xmath57 imposition of these boundary conditions on the second order differential equation ( 2 ) yields the critical values @xmath4 of the effective parameter @xmath5 ( 3 ) of the well for a hbs at @xmath8 .",
    "a scattering potential well which is such that @xmath58 , has at least one [ 10 ] bound state for howsoever small value of @xmath5 .",
    "so a hbs has at least one node .",
    "amusingly the node less hbs is nothing but constant : @xmath59 which exists when the depth of the potential is set equal to zero ! for the symmetric case ,",
    "@xmath60 is the node and for the non - symmetric case the node could be found at @xmath61 , where @xmath62 if at @xmath8 the well has the solitary hbs of @xmath63-nodes , it will have @xmath63 number of bound state for @xmath14 .    to illustrate an hbs , one can readily check for @xmath64 there is one node less ground state @xmath65 ( @xmath66)$ ] at @xmath67 , whereas @xmath68 is a hbs at @xmath8 . in one dimension hbs is usually ignored .",

    "this completes our rephrasing of zero reflection at zero energy when an attractive well possesses a half bound state at zero energy .",
    "we find that the single dirac delta well potential [ 3 ] in any case yields @xmath1 and becomes a trivial exception to the zero reflection at zero energy . in section",
    "ii , we present two illustrations of attractive potentials possessing zero energy bound state an @xmath2 . in section iii , we explore low reflection at a low energy in various attractive potential wells",

    "so @xmath69 is a hbs satisfying the conditions ( 5 ) , here @xmath100 . in fig.1",
    "we plot first three @xmath101 hbs for @xmath13 .",
    "this potential may be dismissed to be a very special one , for instance it has energy oscillations in @xmath0 .",
    "so below , we present the exponential potential as a nontrivial example .",
    "this symmetric attractive potential which vanishes asymptotically is expressed as @xmath102 the exponential potential is also a commonly discussed central potential for both bound and scattering states [ 3,5 ] . its reflection amplitude is given in terms of the cylindrical bessel functions @xmath103 [ 13 ] as [ 6 ] @xmath104 here @xmath105 [ 13 ] .",
    "it may be readily checked that the limit of @xmath82 as @xmath6 is -1 , until @xmath5 is a zero of the function @xmath72 . in this case @xmath81",
    "is indeterminate . in order to get to the correct limit one can maclaurian expand @xmath106 about @xmath107 so for very small values of @xmath108 , one can write @xmath109 [ 13 ] , where @xmath110 is zeroth order neumann function",
    ". we also use a result that @xmath111 [ 13 ] .",
    "so for values of @xmath6 we can write @xmath112 clearly if @xmath113 or @xmath114 i.e. @xmath5 coincides with the well known [ 13 ] zeros of @xmath72 , and @xmath115 ; @xmath116 . therefore ,",

    "let us insert ( 11 ) in ( 2 ) , the two linearly independent solutions are well known [ 3,5,6 ] as @xmath120 .",
    "for very small values of @xmath121 , @xmath122 so we note that choosing @xmath123 , we get @xmath124 and @xmath125 the correct asymptotic behaviour of bound states . since the potential is symmetric , we can choose two linearly independent solutions @xmath45 and @xmath46 which are of even and odd parity respectively such that @xmath126 .",
    "for even parity states we write @xmath127 for odd parity states we write",
    "@xmath128 where @xmath129 notice that in both the cases conditions of continuity and differentiability of the eigenstates are satisfied under the given eigenvalue conditions .",

    "further , we suggest that one can _ now _ study at least two more examples : ( i ) soliton potential @xmath134 [ 3,4,6 ] which is known to be reflectionless for all positive energies : @xmath135 whenever @xmath136 , we would like to point out that at these values of @xmath108 these potentials have a half bound - state at @xmath8 ( with number of nodes 1,2,3 , ... ,",

    "<S> usually , the reflection probability @xmath0 of a particle of zero energy incident on a potential which converges to zero asymptotically is found to be 1 : @xmath1 . but earlier , a paradoxical phenomenon of zero reflection at zero energy ( @xmath2 ) has been revealed as a threshold anomaly . extending the concept of half bound state ( hbs ) of 3d , here we show that in 1d when a symmetric ( asymmetric ) attractive potential well possesses a zero - energy hbs , @xmath2 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this can happen only at some critical values @xmath4 of an effective parameter @xmath5 of the potential well in the limit @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this critical phenomenon in two simple analytically solvable models which are square and exponential wells . </S>",
    "<S> however , in numerical calculations even for these two models @xmath2 is observed only as extrapolation to zero energy from low energies , close to a precise critical value @xmath4 . by numerical investigation of a variety of potential wells , </S>",
