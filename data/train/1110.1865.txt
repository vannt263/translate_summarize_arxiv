    "stein manifolds_. in light of such extensive research , many equivalent definitions of these have arisen , perhaps the most succinct being that a stein @xmath4-manifold is a complex @xmath4-manifold ( with real dimension @xmath5 ) that admits a proper , holomorphic embedding into some complex euclidean space @xmath6 .",
    "a fundamental theorem of eliashberg @xcite ( see also @xcite ) gives a complete topological characterization of those smooth @xmath5-manifolds that admit stein structures .",
    "the statement is quite simple except when @xmath7 , the case of _ stein surfaces_. in that case , the characterization is challenging to apply in practice , although it can be simplified by passing to the topological ( @xmath8 ) category to allow exotic smooth structures @xcite .",
    "the success of abstractly characterizing stein manifolds leads to a more subtle ambient problem : every open subset @xmath9 of a complex manifold inherits a complex structure  when does this make @xmath10 into a stein manifold ?",
    "( when @xmath11 is itself a stein manifold , e.g.  @xmath12 , such a stein @xmath10 is classically called a _ domain of holomorphy_. ) since the answer can change under @xmath8-small perturbations of @xmath10 , we pose a more topological version of the problem : when is @xmath10 _ isotopic _ to a stein manifold ? that is , when is the inclusion of @xmath10 smoothly homotopic through embeddings to one whose image is a stein open subset ?",
    "( in this paper , an embedding is a diffeomorphism onto its image , not necessarily proper . )",
    "eliashberg s method can again answer this question , although the @xmath7 case is again more difficult .",
    "a broad exposition of both the abstract and ambient theories is given in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath7 , the ambient theory again has a topological theorem bypassing the main difficulty of the smooth version by allowing topological isotopies that may change the diffeomorphism type of @xmath10 ; this will be given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the applications of this are powerful , but have the drawback that the resulting stein surfaces typically are not diffeomorphic to the interior of any compact manifold with boundary . in the present paper , we instead require everything to be smooth , so that we can control diffeomorphism types and obtain stein surfaces @xmath9 with smooth , compact , pseudoconvex boundaries . as applications , we construct stein embeddings of exotic @xmath1 s in @xmath0 , as well as various stein embeddings of compact 4-manifolds and pseudoconvex embeddings of 3-manifolds into complex surfaces",
    ". when these complex surfaces are compact , this allows the study of _ concave _ holomorphic fillings of 3-manifolds .",
    "the main principle of this paper is that the only obstruction to isotoping @xmath9 to a stein open subset is that of abstractly making @xmath10 stein .",
    "that is , the ambient problem reduces to the abstract problem , which has been solved by eliashberg s theorem .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this is true in all dimensions , and for @xmath7 is also true in the topological setting @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the main theorem , theorem  [ main ] , was announced in @xcite , but is now cleaner and has a much simpler proof .",
    "we ultimately present the theorem with enough generality to apply to @xcite , but we focus on simpler applications .",
    "for the moment , we give a version of the theorem that is both easy to state and fairly general .",

    "[ smooth ] an open subset @xmath10 of a complex surface is smoothly isotopic to a stein open subset if and only if the induced complex structure on @xmath10 is homotopic ( through almost - complex structures on @xmath10 ) to a stein structure on @xmath10 .",
    "we prove this in section  [ smooth ] ; it follows either from theorem  [ main ] or from a simplified version of its proof . as an immediate application",

    ".    exotic @xmath1 s ( manifolds homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to @xmath1 ) have a complex history , tracing back to casson @xcite .",
    "demichelis and freedman @xcite first showed that uncountably many diffeomorphism types of exotic @xmath14 s can be smoothly embedded in the standard @xmath14 .",
    "after simplification @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , uncountably many of these were shown to admit stein structures in @xcite , but it was previously unknown whether any domain of holomorphy in @xmath15 could be an exotic @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a stein exotic @xmath14 from @xcite .",
    "this smoothly embeds in @xmath14 , hence in an open ball @xmath17 in @xmath15 , preserving orientation .",
    "since @xmath16 is contractible , it has only one almost - complex structure , up to homotopy , compatible with the given orientation .",

    ", it is , by definition , a diffeomorphism to its image , which is the required domain of holomorphy .",
    "clearly , we can realize any of the uncountably many diffeomorphism types of exotic @xmath14 s from @xcite this way .",

    "@xmath18 , which we can assume is a morse function whose indices are necessarily @xmath19 .",
    "`` exhausting '' means the function is proper and bounded below , so without loss of generality it maps to @xmath20 .",
    "plurisubharmonicity ( by which we actually mean _ strict _ plurisubharmonicity ) is essentially characterized by _",
    "( actually _ strict _ pseudoconvexity ) of the level sets , oriented as the boundaries of the sublevel sets @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the level sets are contact manifolds ( positive with respect to the boundary orientation ) .",

    "such a @xmath22 is necessarily compact with pseudoconvex boundary and stein interior , and the morse function induces a handlebody structure on it whose handles are nicely compatible with the contact structures and have indices @xmath23 . if a stein manifold admits an exhausting plurisubharmonic morse function with only finitely many critical points , then after deformation it is the interior of some stein domain . in complex dimension 2",
    ", the handle structure of a stein domain can be encoded in a _",
    "legendrian link diagram_. this does not completely capture the biholomorphism type of the stein domain , but does capture its diffeomorphism type and almost - complex structure , as well as the contact structures of the level sets .",
    "eliashberg s theorem in this dimension states that every such legendrian diagram comes from a stein domain .",
    "( see @xcite for more details and applications . )",
    "most of our applications involve embedding stein domains , so we will be finding stein open subsets that ( unlike the above exotic @xmath1 s ) are cut out of complex surfaces by smooth , compact , pseudoconvex 3-manifolds .",
    "theorem  [ main- ] allows this by expressing the main principle in terms of stein handlebodies , so that we can look for an embedded stein domain with a prespecified legendrian link diagram . focusing on the boundary",
    ", we can look for pseudoconvex embeddings of a suitable prespecified contact 3-manifold .",
    "theorem  [ main- ] is a simplification of theorem  [ main ] , which allows infinite , relative handlebodies .",
    "the full generality will be needed in @xcite , and infinite topology is already needed for theorem  [ smooth ] , in particular for exotic @xmath1 s .    after stating the main principle in terms of handlebodies",
    ", we move on to applications .",
    "section  [ apps ] discusses embedded stein domains that have the homotopy type of a point or 2-sphere .",
    "we easily construct embeddings of contractible stein domains in @xmath0 ( example  [ hsphere ] ) .",
    "this leads to infinitely many homology 3-spheres with pseudoconvex embeddings in @xmath0 , as boundaries of contractible domains of holomorphy .",
    "in contrast , we conjecture that no brieskorn homology sphere ( with either orientation ) admits a pseudoconvex embedding in @xmath0",
    ". we exhibit ( corollary  [ forst ] , figure  [ htpys2 ] ) a stein domain homotopy equivalent to a 2-sphere , holomorphically embedded in @xmath0 , contradicting a conjecture of forstneri @xcite .",
    "( noncompact counterexamples homeomorphic to @xmath24 were exhibited in @xcite , but these had infinite topology , so were not bounded by smooth 3-manifolds . )",
    "we then investigate when a handlebody @xmath25 consisting of a single 0- and 2-handle embeds as a stein handlebody in a ( minimal ) rational ruled surface @xmath26 .",
    "an embedding homologous to some section exists if and only if the intersection forms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 have the same parity and the attaching circle @xmath27 of the 2-handle is isotopic to a legendrian knot with the correct values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( corollary  [ hirz ] ) .",
    "the choice of complex structure on @xmath26 is irrelevant .",
    "we immediately see ( corollary  [ cave ] ) that if the mirror of @xmath27 is isotopic to a suitable legendrian knot , then @xmath25 admits a complex structure with _ pseudoconcave _ boundary  so its boundary inherits a negative contact structure ( relative to the boundary orientation of the complex surface ) .",
    "we call such a compact , complex surface a _ pseudoconcave ( holomorphic ) filling _ of its boundary .",
    "every contact 3-manifold has a concave _",
    "symplectic _ filling @xcite , @xcite , and if it bounds a stein domain it has a pseudoconcave holomorphic filling obtained by projectivizing and desingularizing the given stein surface in @xmath6 .",
    "however , the present paper gives pseudoconcave fillings with more directly controlled topology .",
    "corollary  [ cave ] , for example , shows that if the mirror of @xmath30 is isotopic to a legendrian knot with @xmath31 , then any sufficiently large integer surgery on @xmath27 yields a 3-manifold with a pseudoconcave filling homotopy equivalent to a 2-sphere .",
    "pseudoconcave fillings and embeddings are a recurring theme of this paper , as a simple testing ground for the new technology .",
    "we find pseudoconcave contractible manifolds ( section  [ cork ] ) , and pseudoconcave complex structures on manifolds of the form @xmath32 ( so both boundary components are pseudoconcave in the boundary orientation determined by the complex structure ) .",
    "specifically , we find examples of the latter where @xmath33 is a circle bundle over a surface ( following corollary  [ cave ] ) and where @xmath33 is a brieskorn homology sphere ( theorem  [ ixsig ] ) . for comparison , @xmath34 can never admit a pseudoconvex complex structure since it is not homotopy equivalent to a 2-complex , although it is symplectic with boundary weakly convex ( or concave ) whenever @xmath35 supports a taut @xmath36-foliation @xcite .",
    "also note that pseudoconcave fillings can not exist inside a stein surface ( e.g.  proposition  [ tight](c ) ) .",
    "in section  [ brieskorn ] , we focus on brieskorn homology 3-spheres .",
    "we show ( theorem  [ brieskorn ] ) that with two exceptions , every brieskorn sphere @xmath37 ( suitably oriented ) has a pseudoconvex embedding in every nonspin rational ruled surface , splitting the homology with @xmath38 on each side .",
    "it follows ( corollary  [ briesfill ] ) that each of these 3-manifolds ( suitably oriented ) has a pseudoconcave filling homotopy equivalent to @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting contact structures are usually not homotopic ( as plane fields ) to the ones arising from the description of brieskorn spheres as links of algebraic singularities ( proposition  [ theta ] and following ) , so it seems unlikely that these embeddings can be constructed algebrogeometrically .",
    "we then consider ( theorem  [ ixsig ] and corollary  [ milnordef ] ) the family @xmath39 .",
    "necessarily excluding @xmath40 , we construct pseudoconcave fillings for both orientations , while showing that the 4-manifold @xmath41 admits a complex structure with pseudoconcave boundary .",
    "the bottom boundary , with its orientation as the link of a singularity ( opposite the boundary orientation from the product ) , then inherits a positive contact structure , which is the one coming from the singularity .",
    "we also see that the corresponding milnor fiber can be deformed through complex structures , rel an arbitrarily large compact subset , to be pseudoconcave at infinity , rather than pseudoconvex .",
    "these results are obtained by compactifying the milnor fiber in a way generalizing the description of an elliptic surface as a milnor fiber union a nucleus , then applying theorem  [ main- ] to the generalized nucleus . as a byproduct",
    ", we obtain a simple polynomial expression for the signature of the @xmath3 milnor fiber , namely @xmath42 ( corollary  [ sigma ] ) .",
    "( more general formulas for signatures of milnor fibers can be found in the literature , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , but these typically involve more complicated expressions such as dedekind sums or enumeration of lattice points . )",
    "section  [ cork ] shows how various results in the literature can be sharpened in the presence of an ambient complex structure .",
    "akbulut and mayveyev @xcite showed that a closed , orientable 4-manifold @xmath11 can always be split into two oppositely oriented stein domains , glued along their common boundary .",
    "the algebraic topology is well controlled , so in the simply connected case , one domain can be taken to be contractible . we show that if @xmath11 is a complex surface , then the positively oriented piece can be assumed to be holomorphically embedded ( theorem  [ ampsc ] ) .",
    "akbulut and matveyev showed that their splitting applies to _ corks _ : compact , contractible submanifolds with boundary that can be cut out and reglued to change the smooth structure .",
    "( see section  [ cork ] for further discussion . )",
    "when one or both of the resulting homeomorphic pair of closed manifolds are complex surfaces , we show ( theorem  [ cork ] ) that the corks can be taken either pseudoconvex or pseudoconcave . in either case , when both manifolds are complex , we can assume the pseudoconvex sides of the splittings are given by the same legendrian diagram , up to a small correction if their chern classes differ .",
    "this gives an application of controlling the handlebody structure as allowed by theorem  [ main- ] .",
    "for a second example of sharpening the literature , we consider the paper @xcite , in which akbulut and yasui study several applications of cork twists . of the most interest for the present paper",
    ", they showed ( see theorem  [ ay ] ) that under broad hypotheses , a compact 4-manifold ( with boundary ) embedded in another can be slightly modified to give arbitrarily many embeddings of a fixed manifold in the other , that are pairwise homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic .",
    "we show ( theorem  [ aycave ] ) that when the ambient manifold is complex , the smoothly knotted submanifolds can all be assumed to be pseudoconcave .",
    "this section was inspired by akbulut reminding the author about @xcite and its potential relevance to the present paper .",
    "after a bit of additional background in section  [ back ] , we deal with the main principle in full generality in section  [ smooth ] . in order to deal with infinite and relative stein handlebodies",
    ", we must expand stein theory to include noncompact complex manifolds with boundary .",
    "we call a complex manifold with boundary a _",
    "stein shard _ if it is cut out of a stein manifold by a pseudoconvex hypersurface ( not necessarily compact ) that becomes its boundary ( definition  [ shard ] ) .",
    "equivalently , a stein shard is a complex manifold with pseudoconvex boundary , admitting an exhausting plurisubharmonic function and holomorphically embedding in some open complex manifold of the same dimension ( corollary  [ existspsh ] ) .",
    "a stein manifold is obviously the same as a stein shard without boundary , and in complex dimension @xmath43 a stein domain is the same as a stein shard with compact boundary that intersects each component nontrivially ( proposition  [ tight](a ) ) . as with stein domains ,",
    "the interior of a stein shard is a stein manifold ( proposition  [ int ] ) , and in complex dimension 2 , the boundary is a tight contact manifold ( proposition  [ tight](b ) ) .",
    "we define relative stein handlebodies built on any stein shard @xmath22 in such a way that every subhandlebody is again a stein shard ( definition  [ shb ] ) .",
    "these are sufficiently general that every stein manifold , up to suitable deformation , is the interior of a possibly infinite stein handlebody with @xmath44 ( corollary  [ all ] in complex dimension 2 , corollary  5.2 of @xcite otherwise , cf .",
    "proposition  [ steinhb ] ) .",
    "we state and prove the main principle in this generality ( theorem  [ main ] ) , which will be needed in @xcite .",
    "theorems  [ smooth ] and [ main- ] follow .",
    "our notion of a stein handlebody also seems useful for finite handlebodies with @xmath44 .",
    "it is sometimes natural to consider those stein domains ( or manifolds ) that arise from eliashberg s construction .",
    "unfortunately , this notion is rather vague , since the biholomorphism type of a stein domain changes under small deformations .",
    "if we have actually built the handlebody by eliashberg s method , then the condition is obviously satisfied , but if it arises in a different way , even by a minor variation of the method , the situation is unclear .",
    "instead , we have defined stein handlebodies using the main consequences of the method , to obtain a more precise and a priori larger collection of stein domains that in complex dimension  2 are associated to legendrian link diagrams in the manner arising from eliashberg s construction .",
    "this paper involves the interplay between manifolds with and without boundary .",
    "our convention is that manifolds are assumed not to have boundary unless otherwise specified .",
    "stein domains and shards can have boundary by definition , as do the closed interval @xmath45 $ ] and disks of any dimension .",
    "thus , handles are compact , and handlebodies have boundary coming from the co - attaching regions .",
    "complex manifolds with boundary involve a subtlety : their usual definition allows coordinate charts such as @xmath46 near 0 on the closed right half - space of @xmath47 , which is a diffeomorphism onto its image , that is holomorphic ( satisfying the cauchy - riemann equations ) everywhere , but is analytic at @xmath48 ( represented by a power series ) only when @xmath49 . in higher dimensions ,",
    "a complex manifold with boundary charts of this sort need not admit a holomorphic embedding into any open complex manifold of the same dimension .",
    "however , the complex manifolds with boundary in this paper are always given to be cut out of open complex manifolds by smooth hypersurfaces .",
    "similarly , the contact structures constructed on 3-manifolds in this paper are always tight  in fact , stein fillable for some orientation on the 3-manifold ( cf .  section  [ back ] ) , and the pseudoconcave fillings all embed holomorphically in closed complex manifolds so that the closed complement is a stein domain .    the author wishes to thank yasha eliashberg for many helpful discussions .",
    "we begin with a quick sketch of eliashberg s method for constructing stein manifolds @xcite , @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath33 is an oriented real hypersurface ( real codimension 1 ) in a complex @xmath4-manifold @xmath11 with ( almost ) complex structure @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath33 inherits a hyperplane field @xmath51 of maximal complex subspaces of the tangent spaces .",
    "the condition that @xmath33 is pseudoconvex ( or equivalently , @xmath52 is pseudoconcave ) implies , and when @xmath7 is equivalent to , the condition that @xmath53 is a positive contact structure on @xmath33 ( negative contact structure on @xmath52 ) .",
    "this means that @xmath53 is the kernel of some 1-form @xmath54 for which @xmath55 is a positive volume form on @xmath33 ( negative volume form on @xmath52 ) .",
    "now suppose that @xmath33 is the boundary ( necessarily pseudoconvex ) of a stein domain @xmath56 , and that @xmath57 is a real - analytically embedded @xmath58-disk in @xmath11 with @xmath59 .",
    "suppose that @xmath57 is totally real ( i.e.  the tangent bundle @xmath60 contains no complex lines ) and intersects @xmath33 @xmath13-orthogonally , i.e. , transversely with @xmath61 along @xmath62 .",
    "eliashberg s main lemma asserts that @xmath57 is the core of a @xmath58-handle @xmath63 for which @xmath64 is again a stein domain .",
    "note that @xmath13-orthogonality implies that @xmath65 .",
    "a submanifold of @xmath33 whose tangent spaces all lie in @xmath53 is called _ isotropic _ , or _ legendrian _ if @xmath66 . if @xmath22 is instead an abstractly given stein domain , one can attach a standard holomorphic @xmath58-handle @xmath67 along a preassigned isotropic @xmath68-sphere to obtain a complex manifold with boundary , in which eliashberg s lemma applies . replacing the standard handle by the thinner one inside it given by the lemma , we again obtain a stein domain @xmath64 .",
    "thus , in either the ambient or abstract setting , we have a method for inductively constructing stein domains as handlebodies . in either setting ,",
    "given an arbitrary almost - complex handlebody with all indices @xmath69 , where the almost - complex structure in the ambient case is inherited from @xmath11 , there is ultimately only one obstruction to making it into a stein domain : when @xmath70 , a smoothly embedded disk @xmath71 can not always be isotoped to a totally real disk @xmath13-orthogonal to @xmath72 .",
    "this explains the extra complications of the theory when @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath7 , we start with a 4-dimensional , compact , almost - complex handlebody @xmath73 whose handles have indices @xmath74 , and wish to inductively transform it into a stein domain . over the union @xmath75 of 0- and 1-handles , the general theory applies with no difficulty , and we canonically obtain a contact structure on @xmath76 , which is a connected sum of copies of @xmath77 .",
    "the attaching circles of the 2-handles form a link in this contact 3-manifold .",
    "we can assume this is legendrian , since every link in a contact 3-manifold is isotopic to a legendrian link .",
    "there is a standard way to represent legendrian links in @xmath76 by diagrams @xcite , @xcite , e.g.  figure  [ htpys2 ] below .",
    "each oriented legendrian circle @xmath27 then has two integer - valued invariants , the _ thurston - bennequin invariant _ @xmath78 and _ rotation number _ @xmath79 .",
    "these can be read off of the diagram by counting cusps and crossings .",
    "( the invariant @xmath78 is the signed number of self - crossings minus the number of left cusps , and the rotation number is half the signed number of cusps , where the sign of a cusp depends on the orientation of the knot , positive when the cusp is traversed downward . )",
    "the invariant @xmath78 can be decreased arbitrarily by adding zig - zags to the diagram , each of which can either increase or decrease @xmath79 by 1 , but @xmath78 can not always be increased by isotopy .",
    "the obstruction to extending a stein structure over a 2-handle with attaching circle @xmath27 is that for the core to be totally real , the 2-handle framing coefficient must equal @xmath80 and the chern number of @xmath13 on the ( oriented ) core , relative to the standard complex framing on @xmath75 ( determined by the diagram ) , must be @xmath79 .",
    "it follows that any legendrian link diagram represents a handlebody realizable as a stein domain , where the framing on each 2-handle is given by @xmath80 , and the chern class is given by a cocycle whose value on each oriented 2-handle is the rotation number of its attaching circle .",
    "we use the term _ stein handlebody _ to include any stein domain exhibited as a handlebody built by eliashberg s method .",
    "we define the term carefully in section  [ smooth ] , in all dimensions and allowing infinite and relative handlebodies built on a stein shard , but for now we focus on the compact , absolute , 4-dimensional case . for every stein domain of real dimension 4 ,",
    "every generic plurisubharmonic function that is constant on the boundary determines a legendrian link diagram ( up to legendrian isotopy ) , and the original complex structure deforms to one built as a stein handlebody from that diagram .",
    "we can now state our main principle in the language of stein handlebodies .",
    "the following is a simplified version of theorem  [ main ] ( cf .",
    "also @xcite theorem  13.8 ) .",
    "[ main- ] let @xmath73 be a compact , 4-dimensional stein handlebody with a smooth embedding into a complex surface @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that the complex structure on @xmath25 induced by the embedding is homotopic ( through almost - complex structures ) to @xmath13",
    ". then after a smooth ambient isotopy of the embedding , the induced complex structure @xmath81 on @xmath25 makes it a holomorphically embedded stein handlebody with the same legendrian diagram as @xmath73 .",
    "the two stein structures determine the same contact structure on @xmath82 .",
    "recall that an _ ambient _ isotopy is obtained by composing the embedding with an isotopy of @xmath83 through diffeomorphisms of @xmath11 . in particular , the diffeomorphism type of the complement of @xmath25 is preserved .",
    "( the isotopy extension theorem asserts that every smooth isotopy of a compact submanifold extends to such an isotopy with compact support . )",
    "theorem  [ main- ] says that to realize a compact 4-manifold ( with boundary ) as a holomorphically embedded stein domain in a complex surface , it is enough to realize it abstractly as a stein domain and then find a smooth embedding of it that respects the homotopy class of the complex structure .",
    "in general , if @xmath84 has no 2-torsion , this homotopy class is preserved if and only if the orientation and the chern class @xmath85 are preserved .",
    "this is because the space of complex vector space structures on @xmath1 determining its usual orientation has the homotopy type of @xmath2 , so the first uniqueness obstruction is in @xmath84  in fact , it is half the difference of the corresponding chern classes .",
    "since a stein surface has the homotopy type of a 2-complex , this is the only obstruction ( and a homotopy class of almost - complex structures is essentially the same as a spin@xmath86 structure ) .",
    "most of our examples have no torsion , but section  [ cork ] shows how to apply the theorem when 2-torsion may be present .",
    "for another such application , we have :    if a stein surface or stein domain embeds symplectically into a khler surface , then the embedding is isotopic to an embedding ( typically not symplectic ) whose image is stein .",
    "a symplectic embedding ( of the khler structure induced by some plurisubharmonic function ) preserves the homotopy class of the almost - complex structure .",
    "apply theorem  [ smooth ] or [ main- ] , respectively , to the two cases .",
    "note that the converse is false . if @xmath87 is a complex curve in a khler surface and @xmath88 , then by theorem  [ main- ] , a tubular neighborhood of @xmath89 is isotopic to a stein domain @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "corollary  [ hirz ] and subsequent discussion ) . however , the khler form @xmath90 restricted to @xmath10 is not induced by the stein domain structure , since it is not exact .",
    "( its value on the generator of @xmath91 must be @xmath92 . )",
    "to warm up , we consider stein handlebodies with the homotopy type of a point or a 2-sphere .",
    "the first case , contractible stein domains , follows by generalizing our discussion of exotic @xmath1 s in the introduction ( corollary  [ r4 ] ) , and leads to a discussion of pseudoconvex embeddings of homology 3-spheres .",
    "[ contractible ] if @xmath17 is a stein surface or stein domain , and @xmath93 , then every orientation - preserving embedding of @xmath17 into a complex surface is isotopic to one with stein image .",
    "the cohomological condition implies @xmath17 has a unique homotopy class of almost - complex structures respecting the given orientation .",
    "apply theorem  [ smooth ] or [ main- ] as before .",

    "these steps cause no changes at the level of homology , so the inclusions still preserve the almost - complex structures up to homotopy , and theorem  [ main- ] still applies .",
    "for related applications , we consider the recent work of akbulut and yasui @xcite .",
    "their main theorem  6.3 asserts that any 4-dimensional , compact , oriented handlebody with @xmath402 and no 3- or 4-handles can be modified by a homotopy equivalence ( preserving the intersection pairing but not the fundamental group of the boundary ) , after which it admits an arbitrarily large finite number of exotic ( nondiffeomorphic ) smooth structures , each of which can be realized as a stein domain .",

    "we combine their proof with that of theorem  [ ampsc ] . the first step of the proof of @xcite  theorem  6.3 is to slide and order the 2-handles of @xmath11 so that the first batch is algebraically disjoint from the 1-handles and represents a basis of @xmath410 . after this",

    "we choose the signs of the latter so that the relative chern class of the handlebody on @xmath421 agrees with its value on @xmath380 before the modification .",
    "then the embedding preserves the homotopy class of the almost - complex structures everywhere , and theorem  [ main- ] isotopes the embedding so that its boundary is pseudoconvex and its complement @xmath407 is pseudoconcave as required .",

    "having explored various applications , we now wish to prove the main theorems , suitably generalized . in preparation , we review some basic background material . for more detail , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we first return to eliashberg s construction of stein manifolds .",
    "section  [ basics ] discussed how to attach a single handle , preserving pseudoconvexity of a boundary .",
    "eliashberg uses this to inductively construct stein manifolds .",
    "( in his approach , a trivial collar of the boundary is also attached with each handle , so infinite topology does not cause difficulties . ) to prove that the resulting manifold is stein , one must see that it admits an exhausting , plurisubharmonic function ; this suffices by work of grauert @xcite .",
    "plurisubharmonic ( equivalently , _",
    "@xmath13-convex _ ) functions have various useful properties @xcite .",
    "the maximum of two such functions is a `` continuous @xmath13-convex function '' , which can be smoothed to a plurisubharmonic function by a @xmath8-small perturbation , relative to a compact subset near which the function is already smooth .",
    "plurisubharmonicity and pseudoconvexity are both local , @xmath36-open conditions .",
    "thus , every pseudoconvex hypersurface @xmath33 in a complex manifold has a neighborhood foliated by such hypersurfaces , given as a suitable open subset of any tubular neighborhood @xmath423 with its product foliation .",
    "one can then introduce a plurisubharmonic function : any function with no critical points and all level sets pseudoconvex ( such as projection to @xmath424 in the above neighborhood ) can be made plurisubharmonic on a preassigned compact subset of its domain by postcomposing with a suitable diffeomorphism of @xmath424 .",
    "( it then increases in the outward direction , so the level sets are pseudoconvex in the boundary orientation from the sublevel sets . )",
    "this can be done relative to some open subset on which plurisubharmonicity already holds ( and where critical points are allowed ) , since plurisubharmonicity is preserved when we postcompose with any smooth function @xmath425 with @xmath426 and @xmath427 .",
    "for example , we can prove that a given compact complex manifold @xmath22 is a stein domain if we can just construct a plurisubbharmonic function @xmath428 $ ] with @xmath429 , and a codimension-0 holomorphic embedding of @xmath22 into some open complex manifold @xmath11 .",
    "then we extend @xmath18 over a collar of @xmath430 to get an exhausting plurisubharmonic function realizing a neighborhood of @xmath22 as a stein manifold with @xmath22 a sublevel set .",
    "( beware that an arbitrary stein domain in a stein manifold need not arise as a plurisubharmonic sublevel set of the latter : @xmath431 has a tubular neighborhood that is a stein domain , but any relative morse function on the pair must have an index-3 critical point to kill @xmath432 . ) eliashberg uses this technology to construct the required plurisubharmonic function on his manifold : suppose a @xmath58-handle @xmath380 is attached by his method to @xmath22 along a pseudoconvex boundary , and @xmath18 is a plurisubharmonic function on @xmath22 with @xmath433 .",
    "eliashberg shows that after composition with a suitable @xmath425 on @xmath434 $ ] that is the identity outside a preassigned neighborhood of @xmath435 , and after modification of @xmath18 in a preassigned neighborhood of @xmath380 , the function extends plurisubharmonically over @xmath380 with a unique new critical point ( morse , of index @xmath58 ) so that @xmath436 is a level set .",
    "induction on handles gives the required plurisubharmonic function on eliashberg s manifold .",
    "recall that the extra complication of eliashberg s method in complex dimension 2 is that a 2-handle core can not always be made totally real by an isotopy suitably controlled on the boundary .",
    "more generally , suppose @xmath128 is a compact , connected , oriented surface in a complex surface @xmath11 .",
    "generically , @xmath128 is totally real in a neighborhood of its boundary .",
    "this condition gives a canonical complex basis @xmath437 for @xmath438 along @xmath439 , namely the tangent and normal vector fields to @xmath439 in @xmath440 , which we can use to define relative characteristic classes .",
    "eliashberg and harlamov ( @xcite , see @xcite for a proof in english ) showed that @xmath128 is then isotopic , rel a neighborhood of the boundary , to a totally real surface if and only if two relative characteristic numbers vanish .",
    "the first is @xmath441 , where @xmath442 is the euler characteristic , and @xmath443 is the normal euler number of @xmath128 relative to @xmath444 , only depending on @xmath13 through @xmath444 .",
    "the second is @xmath445 , which only depends on the complex bundle @xmath438 , its framing over @xmath439 , and the class of @xmath128 in @xmath446 .",
    "the isotopy is @xmath8-small .",
    "if @xmath447 is an oriented hypersurface , we have seen that it inherits an oriented plane field @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , the canonical map from complex bundle structures on @xmath448 to oriented plane fields is a bijection on homotopy classes , preserving @xmath85 , with inverse constructed by choosing a complementary trivial complex line subbundle . if a compact , oriented surface @xmath128 intersects @xmath33 transversely along @xmath449 , and this is legendrian in @xmath33 , then @xmath128 must be totally real near @xmath439 .",
    "thus , the two obstructions to reality are defined , and are preserved by any homotopy of the almost - complex structure that fixes @xmath53 .",

    "the invariant @xmath28 is the coefficient of the contact framing , so for an almost - complex 2-handle attached along a legendrian knot , the reality obstructions for its core are measured by the difference of its framing and relative chern class from @xmath450 and @xmath29 , respectively . in general ,",
    "eliashberg s method attaches a 2-handle along a legendrian knot with framing obtained from the contact framing by a left twist .",

    "eliashberg s main lemma now locates a @xmath58-handle @xmath631 with core @xmath630 , attached to @xmath617 preserving pseudoconvexity of the boundary . by proposition  [ steinhb ] ,",
    "the union @xmath632 of @xmath617 with the handles @xmath633 for all @xmath58-handles of @xmath25 is a relative stein handlebody .",
    "we now construct an isotopy of @xmath425 , supported near the @xmath58-handles and @xmath610-small on @xmath482 , after which @xmath425 maps the set @xmath481 onto @xmath632 .",
    "first , push each @xmath58-handle @xmath634 down ( toward @xmath617 ) so that its attaching region @xmath635 has fixed boundary but interior disjoint from its former location , and near the boundary of @xmath636 , @xmath637 goes contactomorphically into @xmath638 .",
    "( this is @xmath610-small since @xmath544 is @xmath639-close to @xmath529 , on which @xmath425 was already a contactomorphism . )",
    "we can assume that @xmath425 is still a contactomorphism on each @xmath640 , @xmath641 , by interpolating between boundaries and applying gray s construction as before .",
    "it is now easy to isotope @xmath425 rel a neighborhood of @xmath482 , so that @xmath642 .",
    "our initial induction hypotheses are preserved , and we have incremented @xmath58 for one of them : @xmath425 induces a stein handlebody structure on @xmath609 .",
    "there are two induction hypotheses left to reconstruct : we must arrange @xmath637 to be a contactomorphism , and construct a suitable homotopy of @xmath619 if @xmath643 .",
    "the first hypothesis is easy when @xmath621 , since the boundary of a 0-handle is @xmath115 , on which any two tight contact structures are isotopic .",
    "( note that the handle lies in the interior of its original location , so we can perform the isotopy while keeping each subhandlebody of @xmath612 within its original location as required . )",
    "when @xmath624 , the co - attaching region @xmath644 of each @xmath58-handle is a solid torus @xmath645 as in the proof of proposition  [ core ] , whose tight contact structure is uniquely determined rel boundary by the dividing curves .",
    "when @xmath646 , @xmath647 again has a unique tight contact structure @xmath53 rel boundary , so we can again isotope @xmath425 to make it a contactomorphism on @xmath544 .",
    "now , however , we have a choice of isotopy : if @xmath648 is an arc transverse to @xmath53 and isotopic to @xmath649 rel boundary , there is an obvious diffeomorphism @xmath485 of @xmath455 rel boundary that fixes @xmath650 but puts a @xmath651-twist in its normal bundle .",
    "( rotate @xmath652 by @xmath653 about @xmath101 . )",
    "we can arrange @xmath485 to be a contactomorphism ( e.g.  using a local model for the transverse arc @xmath650 and uniqueness on the remaining ball ) . since @xmath654 , each even power @xmath655 has an isotopy @xmath656 rel boundary ( but moving @xmath650 ) to the identity .",
    "however , there can be no such isotopy through contactomorphisms . to see this , fix a nowhere - zero vector field @xmath657 on @xmath53 ( which can be done since @xmath658 ) .",
    "then any contact isotopy of @xmath650 is covered by @xmath659 in an obvious way , so that if @xmath650 is returned to its original position then so is @xmath659 .",
    "however , @xmath655 changes @xmath659 by @xmath660 twists , so it can not be obtained by contact isotopy rel @xmath661 from the identity .",
    "we can interpret this @xmath660 as the chern number , relative to @xmath657 on the boundary , of @xmath662 over @xmath663 .",
    "we have now arranged @xmath637 to be a contactomorphism as required , and for @xmath646 we can isotopically change our choice of such @xmath425 in an essential way by composing with even powers of @xmath485 on the 1-handles .",
    "( we take the isotopy to be ambient in @xmath11 , but supported in the original image of @xmath425 . )    to complete the induction and the proof , it remains to construct a suitable homotopy of @xmath619 for @xmath643 .",
    "our isotopies of @xmath425 so far have not disturbed the induction hypothesis that @xmath619 is homotopic to @xmath605 on @xmath620 through almost - complex structures inducing a fixed contact structure on @xmath529 .",
    "we restrict the homotopy to @xmath664 , and wish to arrange the homotopy to fix the contact structure on @xmath544 .",
    "we already know that the contact structure is fixed away from the @xmath58-handles , and that the initial and final contact structures are equal everywhere , although the intermediate plane fields may not be contact on the @xmath58-handle boundaries .",
    "we arrange the contact structure to be fixed except on a ball in each @xmath58-handle boundary : the set of oriented planes at a given point in @xmath544 can be identified with @xmath2 ( by the positive normal vector , or by the identification of complex vector space structures with @xmath665 ) .",
    "this is simply connected , so we can modify our homotopy rel @xmath666 to fix the contact structure near a given point , giving the required condition when @xmath621 . for the remaining case @xmath646 , note that @xmath667 , so the given homotopy @xmath451 may be nontrivial on the 1-handle boundaries .",
    "the obstruction is measured by the relative chern number for each 1-handle as in the previous paragraph .",
    "this reduces mod 2 to the relative stiefel - whitney number @xmath668 , which vanishes since @xmath451 stabilizes to the tangent bundle @xmath669 , and the boundary framing on this induced by @xmath670 obviously extends .",
    "thus , the homotopy changes @xmath659 by an even number of twists , and after composing with an even power of @xmath485 on each 1-handle , we can assume the obstruction vanishes .",
    "we can now assume the homotopy fixes the contact structure away from a collection of balls for both @xmath671 .",
    "we can arrange these balls to be disjoint from the attaching regions of the handles of indices @xmath672 ( a regular neighborhood of a 1-complex in a 3-manifold ) .",
    "we are then free to redefine the homotopy on the balls so that it fixes the contact structure there , reconstructing the last induction hypothesis .",
    "[ main2 ] let @xmath17 be a stein surface with an exhausting plurisubharmonic morse function @xmath18 , and let @xmath673 $ ] be some regular sublevel set ( possibly empty ) .",
    "let @xmath674 be a smooth embedding into a complex surface .",
    "suppose that the complex structure @xmath604 on @xmath11 pulls back to one on @xmath17 that is homotopic rel @xmath22 to the original complex structure @xmath675 .",
    "then @xmath425 is smoothly isotopic rel @xmath22 to @xmath606 , with @xmath676 exhibited as a stein surface by a plurisubharmonic function obtained by postcomposing @xmath677 with a suitable diffeomorphism of @xmath424 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath606 restricts to a contactomorphism on all level sets of @xmath18 avoiding a preassigned neighborhood of the critical values @xmath678 .",
    "the isotopy may not be ambient .",
    "consider , for example , @xmath679 embedded in @xmath680 as the complement of the closed ray @xmath681 .",
    "any ambient isotopy sends this to the complement of some ray , which is not a domain of holomorphy since any holomorphic function on it extends over @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath682 be regular sublevel sets exhausting @xmath17 , with at most one critical level in each @xmath683 .",
    "inductively assume that @xmath684 is plurisubharmonic on ( hence near ) @xmath685 , @xmath425 is a contactomorphism on @xmath686 and on the specified level sets in @xmath687 , and @xmath619 is homotopic to @xmath675 on @xmath688 , fixing the contact structure on @xmath686 .",
    "following the previous proof , we will extend these hypotheses to @xmath689 by isotoping @xmath425 rel @xmath687 and postcomposing @xmath18 with a suitable function , so the theorem follows .",
    "first , use gray s theorem on a collar of @xmath687 to extend the hypotheses over a larger sublevel set , including all specified levels below the given critical value .",
    "now we can easily work rel @xmath687 . use the descending disks of the ( finitely many ) critical points in @xmath683 to construct totally real , analytic core disks in @xmath11 as before .",
    "apply eliashberg s lemma as before , then use standard models from morse theory to isotope @xmath425 and postcompose so that the newly constructed morse function agrees with @xmath684 .",
    "since the 2-handles of @xmath683 can be prechosen to lie in preassigned neighborhoods of the critical points , we can assume their attaching regions lie in standard neighborhoods of their attaching circles , so the rest of the proof works as before until the last step : we did not recover the homotopy of @xmath619 over 2-handles , so the resulting homotopy fixes the contact structure only outside a collection of balls and solid tori ( the co - attaching regions of the 2-handles ) .",
    "however , we can still assume these are disjoint from subsequent attaching regions ( that is , their ascending trajectories never hit critical points ) , so we can redefine the homotopy as before .        by lemma",
    "a.2 of @xcite , @xmath17 is diffeomorphic to the interior of a stein handlebody @xmath25 , preserving the complex structures up to homotopy .",
    "( work is required in order to convert a morse function with infinitely many critical values into an infinite handlebody with only three layers of handles , preserving the framing condition for the 2-handles . )",
    "properly isotope @xmath25 into its own interior in the obvious way , then identify the latter with @xmath17 . theorem  [ main ] completes the proof .",
    "the result follows immediately from theorem  [ main2 ] .",
    "alternatively , further homotopy of the almost - complex structure allows us to identify the model stein surface as the interior of a stein handlebody , using lemma  a.2 of @xcite if there are infinitely many critical points",
    ". then theorem  [ main ] completes the proof as for the previous corollary .",
