    "the study of the problem of lorentz symmetry breaking appeared in the physics literature motivated by the fact that the superstring theories suggest that lorentz symmetry should be violated at higher energies prd 39 ( 1989 ) 683 .",
    "recently , a large amount of works considering the impact of some kind of lorentz symmetry breaking have appeared in the literature .",
    "for instance , some years ago , carrol , field and jackiw @xcite addressed the problem with cpt ( charge conjugation - parity - time reversal ) symmetry violation . on the other hand , some impact over the standard model due to lorentz and cpt symmetries were discussed by colladay and kostelecky @xcite .",
    "other problem analyzed in the literature is the spontaneous breaking of the four - dimensional lorentz invariance of the qed @xcite . at this point , it is interesting to mention that a space - time with torsion interacting with a maxwell field by means of chern - simons - like term was introduced by the authors in ref . @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is possible to explain the optical activity in the synchrotron radiation emitted by cosmological distant radio sources .",
    "recently motivated by the problem of lorentz symmetry violating gauge theories in connection with gravity models , boldo _",
    "et al_. @xcite have analyzed the graviton excitations and lorentz - violating gravity with cosmological constant .",
    "it is  important to remark that a considerable effort has been done experimentally to observe signs of the lorentz and cpt symmetries violation effects .",
    "in fact , in a very recent work , maccione , liberati and sigh @xcite have shown that experimental data on the photon content of ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays lead to strong constraints over the lorentz symmetry violations in stringy space - time foam models .",
    "this was done by studying the time delay between @xmath0 rays of different energies from extragalactic sources .",
    "moreover , giulia gubitosi _",
    "et al_. @xcite have introduced an important role in the study of planck - scale modifications to electrodynamics characterized by a spacelike symmetry - breaking vector .",
    "this year , several studies involving lorentz violation has appeared in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "finally , it is important to remark that nonlinear models which have topological solutions are very interesting and important in many branches of physics @xcite-@xcite . in a recent work prd 74 ( 2006 ) 085030 it was shown that some nonlinear models in two - dimensional space - time were two scalar fields interact in the lorentz and cpt violating scenarios present static solitonic configurations .",
    "this was done by generalizing a model presented by barreto and collaborators prd 73 ( 2006 ) 065015 . finally , in a very recent work , bazeia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite _ _  _ _ also _ _  _",
    "_ have analyzed the effects of the lorentz violation on topological defects generated by two real scalar fields . in that case , the lorentz - violating is induced by a fixed tensor coefficient that couples the two fields . in all of these examples ,",
    "the presented solitonic configurations were static . in this work",
    "we are going to show that it is possible to find nontrivial traveling solutions in this kind of scenario .",
    "this is going to be done by taking as example a generalization of some models recently discussed in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as a consequence , we present a class of traveling solitons in lorentz - violating systems as well as some static configurations .",
    "finally it is shown that the static configurations are not the limit of the traveling ones .",
    "this is done by using an approach developed to deal with some classes of nonlinear models in two - dimensional space - time of two interacting scalar fields which were presented in @xcite . in this last reference",
    "it was shown that these systems in @xmath1 dimensions , the socalled orbit equation can be cast in a form of linear first - order differential equation , thus leading to general solutions of the system .",
    "we also show that the solutions present a critical behavior controlled by the choose of an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "some years ago , it was presented in @xcite a two - field model in 1 + 1 dimensions where the lorentz breaking lagrangian density generalizes some results in the literature . that lagrangian density contains vector functions with dependence on the dynamical scalar fields .",
    "moreover , the mentioned vector functions are responsible by the lorentz symmetry breaking . on the other hand , in reference @xcite , the effects of the lorentz violation on topological defects generated by two real scalar fields was analyzed too , in this last one the lagrangian density has a tensor which it is the term which breaks the lorentz symmetry .",
    "thus , in this work we construct a generalized two - field model in 1 + 1 dimensions which is described by the lagrangian density@xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are vector functions , and @xmath6 is the potential .",
    "furthermore , @xmath7 is a constant tensor , here represented by a @xmath8 matrix , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "in fact , a similar process of breaking the lorentz symmetry was put forward by anacleto _",
    "@xcite in a recent work , where the tensor @xmath7 is a @xmath13 matrix , in that case the authors studied the problem of the acoustic black holes from abelian higgs model with lorentz symmetry breaking . here , as advertised , the tensor @xmath7 is written as@xmath14    note that , from the lagrangian density ( [ e1 ] ) , we can recover the one presented in the work by bazeia _",
    "et al _ @xcite by choosing @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , we can also recover the lagrangian density presented in prd 74 ( 2006 ) 085030 , prd 73 ( 2006 ) 065015 by setting conveniently the above defined parameters .",
    "therefore , we have a more general model including vector functions and a constant tensor .",
    "it is important to remark that the more general model presented here , can be used to bring more information about the impact of the lorentz violation of important systems like , for instance , those presenting topological structures @xcite .    from the lagrangian density ( [ e1 ] ) , we can to write the corresponding equations of motion @xmath20    where the dot stands for derivative with respect to time , while the prime represents derivative with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it can be seen that the two equations in above are carrying informations of the lorentz breaking of the model through the presence of the @xmath24 parameters and the vector functions .",
    "but , as a consequence of the model studied in this work , in general we can not solve analytically the above differential equations . however one can consider an interesting case for the fields configurations , where one searches for traveling waves solutions .",
    "configurations that exhibit traveling waves has an important impact when we study boundary states for d - branes and the supergravity fields for a d - brane @xcite-@xcite .",
    "then , let us begin our search for traveling waves solutions in the form @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the equations ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) take the form@xmath28    with the definitions@xmath29}{(1+\\gamma \\alpha _ { 4})a^{2}-(1-\\gamma \\alpha _ { 1})b^{2}+ab\\gamma ( \\alpha _ { 2}+\\alpha _ { 4})},\\text { \\ }   \\label{e7 } \\\\ & &   \\notag \\\\",

    "thus , it is not difficult to conclude that , after adding the two equations , one can write@xmath32 = 0 .",

    "therefore , we get@xmath35    note that in the above equation , the dependence in @xmath36 has disappeared . however , the dependence of the system in terms of the lorentz breaking parameters is still present but it is implicit .",
    "now , in order to desacouple the above equation , we apply the rotation@xmath37    thus , the equation ( [ e10 ] ) is rewritten as@xmath38    furthermore , performing the dilations@xmath39    one gets@xmath40    at this point one can verify that the above equation allow one to write two first - order coupled differential equations . in this case it is usual to impose that the potential must be written in terms of a superpotential like@xmath41which leads to the following set of equations@xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and this will leads us to the solitonic solutions we are looking for .    in order to analyze the energy of the configurations obtained ,",
