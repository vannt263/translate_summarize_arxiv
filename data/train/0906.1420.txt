    "the kerr black hole has been well studied since the discovery of the kerr solution .",
    "it is an important topic not only in mathematical problems of general theory of relativity , but also for applications in astrophysics . currently , there are many candidates for black holes in the universe and they have a wide range of mass scales ranging from stellar mass scales to galactic nuclei mass scales  @xcite .",
    "one of the ways to investigate the properties of a kerr black hole spacetime is to study geodesic motion in this background .",
    "detailed works on the geodesic motion in black hole spacetimes are summarized in chandrasekhar  @xcite . in the weak field regime , at large distances from the black hole , the orbits of a particle are almost the same as that in newtonian gravity . in the strong field regime , however , the orbits become more complicated and it is difficult to compare the orbits with that in newtonian gravity . for the case of bound geodesics , this can be explained by mismatches between the fundamental frequencies of radial , @xmath1 , polar , @xmath2 and azimuthal - motion , @xmath3 .",
    "for example , @xmath4 shows the precession of the orbital plane and @xmath5 shows the precession of the orbital ellipse .",
    "differences between the fundamental frequencies become larger as the particle goes into the strong gravity region around black hole horizon or separatrix , which is the boundary between stable and unstable orbits .",
    "these relativistic effects have been studied for some cases and some examples of extreme phenomena are found as follows .",
    "wilkins  @xcite derived the analytical expressions for the ratio of the azimuthal frequency and the polar frequency , @xmath6 , when a particle moves on both circular and non - equatorial orbits around the extreme kerr black hole .",
    "he then showed that the ratio becomes larger as the particle approaches the horizon and found that the particle traces out a helix - like orbit on a sphere around the black hole .",
    "he also pointed out that there exist horizon - skimming orbits which have the same radius as the horizon .",
    "horizon - skimming orbits are also studied by numerical calculations including the effects of the emission of gravitational waves from a particle for circular and non - equatorial orbits  @xcite and for generic orbits  @xcite around near - extremal kerr black holes .",
    "glampedakis and kennefick  @xcite numerically investigated the ratio of the azimuthal frequency and the radial frequency , @xmath7 , when a particle moves both on eccentric and equatorial orbits around the kerr black hole .",
    "they found that the ratio becomes larger as the particle approaches the separatrix and the particle traces out a quasi - circular orbit around the periapsis before going back to the apoapsis .",
    "these orbits are called zoom - whirl orbits .",
    "the above results show that the fundamental frequencies play an important role in understanding bound geodesic orbits .",
    "however , the coupling of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 motions in the geodesic equation has prevented one from deriving the fundamental frequencies , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for general bound geodesic orbits until recently . using the elegant hamilton - jacobi formalism , schmidt  @xcite derived the fundamental frequencies without discussing the coupling of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 motions . although his results show that we can expand an arbitrary function of the particle s orbit in a fourier series , we can not estimate the fourier components because of the coupling of the @xmath8 and @xmath9-motion .",
    "mino  @xcite showed that we can separate @xmath8 and @xmath9-motion if we use new time parameter @xmath0 and derived the integral forms of the periods of both @xmath8 and @xmath9-motion with respect to @xmath0 , which is called mino time . combining schmidt s method with mino time , drasco and hughes",
    "@xcite derived the fundamental frequencies and showed how the fourier components of arbitrary functions of orbits with respect to mino time can be computed because of the decoupling of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 motions .",
    "they also showed how from these results using mino time , the fourier components with respect to coordinate time can also be derived . thanks to these results",
    ", one can compute gravitational waves from binary systems in which a stellar mass compact star is moving on a general bound geodesic orbit around a supermassive black hole , the so - called extreme mass ratio inspirals(emris )  @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves from emris are one of the main targets for space - based laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite .    in this paper , we derive analytical expressions for bound timelike geodesic orbits in kerr spacetime using mino time as the independent variable . despite a lot of works on geodesic motion  @xcite ,",
    "the analytical expressions of null or timelike geodesics in kerr spacetime are still important subjects",
    ". fast and accurate computation of null geodesics in kerr spacetime is required to study radiation which pass near black holes in accretion systems such as active galactic nuclei and x - ray binaries ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . fast and accurate computation of timelike geodesics is also required to study gravitational waves from emris and construct efficient templates for lisa data analysis .",
    "rauch and blandford gave tables which reduce the some integral forms of null geodesics to legendre elliptic integrals  @xcite using the radial coordinate as the independent variable  @xcite .",
    "they did not give the complete tables which reduce all the integral forms to the elliptic integrals because it was easier and faster to compute both @xmath10 and @xmath11 coordinates numerically when they studied the optical structure of the primary caustic around kerr black hole . using carlson elliptic integrals  @xcite to calculate all coordinates of null geodesics",
    ", however , dexter and agol showed that they can compute null geodesics more efficiently than numerical integration method  @xcite .",
    "although they did not show analytical expressions of all coordinates of null geodesics since there are so many cases to be considered , they opened their numerical code to compute null geodesics semi - analytically in kerr spacetime .",
    "in this paper , we show that we can easily derive the analytical expressions of bound timelike geodesics in terms of legendre elliptic integrals if we properly transform the @xmath8 and @xmath9 variables .",
    "this is the first time that the analytical expressions of fundamental frequencies are derived .",
    "this is also the first time that the analytical expressions of all geodesic coordinates are derived using mino time as the independent variable .",
    "these analytical expressions of bound timelike geodesic orbits with respect to mino time are simpler than that in @xcite for null geodesics and should be useful to investigate gravitational waves from emris .",
    "the analytical solutions should also be helpful for investigations of bound geodesics in kerr spacetime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in , we review kerr geodesics using observer time .",
    "we then discuss kerr geodesics in mino time and derive the analytical expressions of the fundamental frequencies of bound geodesics in . in , we derive the analytical expressions for bound geodesic orbits .",

    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mass and the angular momentum of the black hole , respectively .",
    "there are three constants of motion , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which are the energy , the z - component of the angular momentum and the carter constant per unit mass , respectively . using reasonable initial conditions for the particle s orbit",
    ", we can derive the orbits using the proper time of the particle , @xmath29 , by numerical integration .",
    "dividing @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 by @xmath33 , we can also derive the orbits with coordinate time @xmath10 by numerical integration .",
    "when the orbits are bound to black hole , however , we have to take care of the turning points in the radial and the polar motion where the signs of @xmath30 and @xmath31 change .",
    "these turning points correspond to periapsis and apoapsis for the radial motion , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the polar motion , where @xmath34 is the minimum value of @xmath9 .",
    "we need smaller stepsizes to resolve the derivatives around turning points .",
    "we can avoid this problem by introducing new variables for the radial and polar motion , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is semilatus rectum and @xmath39 is eccentricity  @xcite . using these new variables , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we can estimate the orbits accurately .",
    "there exists three fundamental frequencies , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for bound kerr geodesics .",
    "however , it is difficult to estimate the fundamental frequencies using ( [ eq : geodesic_tau ] ) because of the coupling of the @xmath8 and @xmath9-motions .",
    "for instance , we immediately face a difficulty when we estimate @xmath1 using @xmath42 because @xmath8 and @xmath9 asynchronously pass their turning points .",
    "we now proceed to derive the analytical expressions for the fundamental frequencies of bound geodesic orbits using mino time . in",
    ", we briefly describe the kerr geodesics in mino time and then show how to derive the analytical expressions for the fundamental frequencies in and . in , we will check the analytical expressions by comparing them with earlier literature .      using mino time , @xmath43 ,",
    "the geodesic equations become @xmath44    it should be noted that , in ( [ eq : geodesic_lam ] ) , @xmath45 depends only on @xmath8 and @xmath46 depends only on @xmath47 .",
    "thus the equations for radial and polar motion are decoupled . for the bound orbits ,",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 become periodic functions which are independent of each other .",
    "the fundamental periods for the radial and polar motion , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with respect to @xmath0 are given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the periapsis and apoapsis for the radial motion respectively , and @xmath56 the inclination angle from the equatorial plane of black hole .",
    "of course , @xmath57 are described by these orbital parameters @xmath58 and given in @xcite .",
    "the angular frequencies of the radial and the polar motion then become @xmath59    we also note that both @xmath60 and @xmath61 in ( [ eq : geodesic_lam ] ) are the sum of a function of @xmath8 and a function of @xmath47 .",
    "then each equations are integrated as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the frequencies of coordinate time @xmath10 and @xmath11 with respect to @xmath0 respectively , which are given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents infinite time average with respect to @xmath0 , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy @xmath69    equation ( [ eq : t_phi_decom ] ) shows that both @xmath70 and @xmath71 consist of two distinct parts .",
    "the first term represents an accumulation over @xmath0-time and the last two terms represent oscillations around it with periods @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we note that the frequencies with respect to @xmath0 are related to the frequencies with distant observer time as  @xcite @xmath74    in the following subsections , and , we discuss the analytical expressions for these frequencies . and",
    "we discuss the analytical expressions of the orbits , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , in .      in this subsection , we derive the analytical expressions for the frequencies of @xmath8 and @xmath9-motion , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , using ( [ eq : lam_r_theta ] ) .",
    "as explained in , @xmath14 and @xmath15 become zero when @xmath8 and @xmath47 go through the turning points , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "thus we usually transform the variables , @xmath8 and @xmath47 , to avoid divergences in the numerical calculation . however we know that ( [ eq : lam_r_theta ] ) can be expressed in terms of the elliptic integrals since both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are fourth order polynomials  @xcite .",
    "it is useful if we know the four zero points of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 to express ( [ eq : lam_r_theta ] ) in terms of the elliptic integrals .",

    "these zero points correspond to turning points , defined in ( [ eq : zero_r_theta ] ) , of radial and polar motion .",
    "but the other two zero points of both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , do not correspond to turning points of radial and polar motion .    using ( [ eq : factor_r_theta ] ) , we can express ( [ eq : lam_r_theta ] ) in terms of the elliptic integrals as @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind defined by @xmath93 in the following , we describe both the elliptic integrals and the elliptic functions using the notation in @xcite .",

    "although it may takes longer time to compute the orbits using the analytical solutions than using numerical integration method  @xcite , but see @xcite , it is not serious in computing gravitational waves .",
