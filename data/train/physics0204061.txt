    "well - known problems of the lorentz - dirac ( ld ) equation,@xcite such as runaway solutions , preacceleration , nonuniqueness , have led to proposals of modified classical equations for the relativistic motion of a point charge in electromagnetic fields , including radiation reaction . recently rohrlich@xcite has asserted that forms of the landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation@xcite represent the exact equation and should replace the flawed one ( ld )  derived by dirac .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to point out that solutions to the ll equation are not generally consistent with maxwell s equations for the radiation .",
    "the result is a fairly simple to show but does not seem to have attracted much attention .    the ld equation for the motion of a point charge @xmath0 of proper velocity @xmath1 in an external electromagnetic field @xmath2 can be written in the index - free formulation@xcite based on clifford s geometric algebra of physical space as@xmath3 where the first term on the right @xmath4 /2 $ ] is the covariant lorentz force , and @xmath5 is identified as the effective field of self interaction .",
    "we use si units with @xmath6 , dots indicate derivatives with respect to proper time , and @xmath7 is two - thirds the time for light to cross the classical electron radius:@xmath8 with @xmath9    equation ( [ ldeq ] ) can be expanded in components to give the standard tensor - component form @xmath10 where @xmath11}\\right )   /d\\tau,$ ] the summation convention is adopted , the brackets @xmath12 $ ] indicate the antisymmetric part , and the metric tensor is @xmath13 however , the component - free algebraic formulation is cleaner and offers additional computational tools . in it , paravectors ( scalars plus vectors )",
    "represent spacetime vectors .",
    "for example @xmath14 is the proper velocity with time component @xmath15 and spatial part @xmath16 an overbar indicates the clifford conjugate @xmath17 and the lorentz - invariant square norm is @xmath18 which gives the minkowski spacetime metric @xmath19 as the metric of paravector space , where @xmath20 is the scalar part of any element @xmath21 since @xmath1 is a unit paravector , @xmath22 and the proper acceleration @xmath23 is orthogonal to @xmath24 as a consequence , @xmath25 is a biparavector ( a spacetime plane , represented by a complex vector ) .",
    "the expansion of @xmath26 gives@xmath27 where the lorentz - invariant larmor power @xmath28 is seen from maxwell s equations @xmath29 to be the power radiated by the accelerating point charge .",
    "it is easily seen@xcite that the ld equation ( [ ldeq ] ) conserves energy and momentum with the radiation field between any two points on the world line of the charge where the acceleration @xmath23 is the same .",
    "the ll equation@xcite is obtained by replacing @xmath30 in the radiation term in ( [ ldeq ] ) by the lorentz force @xmath31@xmath32 where the second line follows from the reality of @xmath31 and its orthogonality with @xmath33this is the equation given by ford and oconnell@xcite , by spohn@xcite , and by rohrlich@xcite in his ( 4a ) .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath23 here remains orthogonal to @xmath33 as rohrlich noted , the last term in ( [ lleq ] ) dictates that the larmor radiation term @xmath34 is replaced in energy - momentum conservation for the ll equation by@xmath35 however , this can differ from the larmor power @xmath36 and it is @xmath34 that is given by maxwell s equations .",
    "the ll equation is the first term in an iterative expansion of the ld equation in powers of @xmath7 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath39th - order approximation of @xmath23 and@xmath40 the lowest - order difference between the proper accelerations of the ld and ll equations is the second - order term @xmath41    rohrlich also gives an alternative form [ his ( 4b ) ] , obtained by replacing @xmath42 with@xmath43 the difference @xmath44 is first order in @xmath45",
    "as a simple example by which to compare solutions of the equations , consider one - dimensional motion in a pure electric field @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a fixed unit vector .",
    "express the proper velocity in terms of the rapidity @xmath48 as @xmath49 then @xmath50 and the lorentz force is @xmath51the ld equation ( [ ldeq ] ) becomes@xmath52 whereas the ll equation ( [ lleq ] ) has the form@xmath53 the ll equation is the first - order iteration of the equation@xmath54 in the limit @xmath55 the iterative solution is seen to approach the ld solution .",
    "to lowest order , the difference between the ld and ll equations is the second - order term @xmath56 the power difference is @xmath57 and @xmath58 , none of which generally vanishes .",
    "ford and oconnell@xcite ( 1993 ) derive analytical solutions of the ll equation ( [ 1dlleqn ] ) for motion of a charge through an electric field in the shape of a step:@xmath59{ll}% 0 , & x<0\\\\ e_{0 } , & 0<x < l\\\\ 0 , & l < x \\end{array } \\right .   \\ , . \\label{efield}%\\ ] ] they also show that these are the smooth limit of numerical solutions for a smooth rise and fall of the field .",
    "let @xmath60 be the proper time that the charge enters the field from the left ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 the proper time that it exits at @xmath63 integration of ( [ 1dlleqn ] ) gives@xmath64{cc}% w_{0 } , & \\tau<0\\\\ w_{0}+\\varepsilon+\\varepsilon\\tau/\\tau_{e } , & 0<\\tau<\\tau_{1}\\\\ w_{2}=w_{0}+\\varepsilon\\tau_{1}/\\tau_{e } , & \\tau_{1}<\\tau\\ , , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where@xmath65 note that @xmath66 is discontinuous : it jumps by @xmath67 as the charge enters the field at @xmath60 and then by @xmath68 as the charge leaves at @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , the acceleration has infinite spikes as the charge enters and leaves the field . in terms of dirac delta functions @xmath69 and heaviside step functions",

    "however , the larmor radiation , proportional to @xmath74 is not .",
    "thus , according to maxwell s equations for the field of a point charge , infinite energy is radiated from the discontinuities .",

    "derivations of the ld equation ( [ ldeq ] ) generally assume an expansion @xmath1 in powers of the time difference corresponding to the effective size of the charge .",
    "the limit of vanishing size is then taken , traditionally with mass renormalization , although such renormalization can be avoided by taking specified combinations of the self field@xcite .",
    "one can not expect the proper velocity to be an analytic function of position in regions where the field itself is discontinuous . however , discontinuous fields are simply idealizations convenient for finding analytic solutions .",
    "solutions of both the ld and ll  equations can be found numerically for more realistic field configurations , and they approach the analytic solutions in the appropriate limit .",
    "rohrlich@xcite claims to have derived the ll equation as an exact classical equation for the point charge .",
    "however , his derivation , like most others@xcite , makes the substitution of an approximate expression from the lorentz - force equation with the justification that the radiation term is small .",
    "he then claims that because higher - order derivates of the velocity than second disappear in dirac s derivation when the limit of vanishing charge radius is taken , one should also be able to ignore corresponding derivatives in the field .",
    "this approach appears to argue more forcefully for the correctness of the ld equation , which as seen above conflicts with the ll equation .",
    "rohrlich@xcite also claims that the ll equation has been obtained in a rigorous mathematical argument by spohn@xcite , but spohn obtains his critical surface perturbatively and does not claim it to be exact to all orders of @xmath7 .",
    "the ll equation differs from the ld equation only in second order in @xmath91 and its solutions to realistic problems are practically indistinguishable from those of the ld equation since @xmath7 is orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest measurable time interval .",
    "nevertheless , as seen above , it is inconsistent with maxwell s equations for the radiation of a point charge and this inconsistency is dramatic in the case of rectiliner motion through a stepped field .",
    "this is in contrast to the ld equation , which is consistent .",
    "yaghjian@xcite has proposed a different correction  to the ld equation .",
    "( most of his book discusses a model of the electron as a spherical insulator of finite radius with a fixed surface charge , but the last section discusses the limit of vanishing radius to find the motion of a point charge . ) he argues that the radiation terms do not act until the field is turned on and consequently should be multiplied by a scalar function that approaches a step function in the limit of a point charge .",
    "this eliminates preacceleration .",
    "although his formulation does not explicitly treat other abrupt changes in the field , for consistency we assume that the sudden drop in the stepped field has no effect on the radiation terms until @xmath92 when the charge leaves the field .",
    "however , this prescription when applied to the stepped field gives precisely the motion of the charge without _ any _ radiation reaction .",
    "it is therefore also inconsistent with energy - momentum conservation and maxwell s equation .",
    "as frequently pointed out@xcite , the problems of the ld equation occur at distance scales well below the compton wavelength , where quantum effects become important .",
    "its breakdown in the description of real particles at such scales is therefore not surprising .",
    "attempts appear so far unsuccessful to find an alternative classical equation of motion for the point charge that is free from problems and consistent with energy - momentum conservation and maxwell s equations ."
