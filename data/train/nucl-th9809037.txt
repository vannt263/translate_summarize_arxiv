    "in recent years , the discussion of relativistic issues in the reactions involving the deuteron has become more and more important .",
    "some well known examples for a clear experimental evidence have been found in the electromagnetic disintegration  @xcite .",
    "this results are supported by a recent analysis of polarization observables of the deuteron in a relativistic framework  @xcite . also , the persistent difference between theory and experiment in polarization observables of proton deuteron scattering have been argued to be of relativistic origin  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the interpretation of new experimental results , e.g. , from tjnaf , also calls for a relativistic treatment .",
    "meanwhile the number of theoretical investigations devoted to this question and to tackle the relativistic aspects of few body systems is increasing .",
    "one may basically recognize two lines : on one hand the majority of approaches uses a nonrelativistic scheme of calculation and take into account some leading order corrections , such as nonnucleonic degrees of freedom like mesonic exchange currents , @xmath1-configurations , @xmath2-states and more .",
    "for a review see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite which also contain an large number of references .",
    "note , however , that the problem of consistency arises as has been recently pointed out again , e.g. , by ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of electrodisintegration .",
    "the second line recognizes the importance of covariance  @xcite .",
    "we follow the bethe - salpeter approach which is covariant by construction and properly defined  @xcite . based on the field theory of particles",
    "this approach is also consistent and automatically takes into account all relativistic effects in the two nucleon system . because of the covariance of the bethe - salpeter equation the amplitudes ( or vertex functions ) may be written in any reference system , and one may chose a convenient one .",
    "however , practical applications are hampered by the difficulty of finding solutions of the bethe - salpeter equation , even in ladder approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the activity on solving the bethe - salpeter equation has increased in recent years  @xcite , and by now parameterizations of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes in euclidean space are available  @xcite .",
    "also , useful results have been achieved by a reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation to a three dimensional one .    here , we examine the nonrelativistic reduction of the bethe - salpeter approach to compare with the results achieved by nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "since the problem has not been solved so far for the general case , we restrict ourself to a special process that is the disintegration of the deuteron.to this end we consider the threshold region only that exhibits already the main features to be discussed .",
    "also , this region is dominated by a single transition amplitude to the @xmath3 final state ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) thus leading to some technical but not substantial simplifications .",
    "the extension to other partial amplitudes is straightforward but tedious , however beyond the scope of our present approach .",
    "indeed , the deuteron disintegration close to threshold energies has been a key reaction to establish subnucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei  @xcite and it attracts continuous attention from theoretical and experimental sides .",
    "it has been an excellent paradigm to examine nonnucleonic degrees of freedom and relativistic effects .",
    "it is well known that the nonrelativistic impulse approximation fails to describe the double differential cross section at momentum transfer squared @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the experimental data do not indicate the deep minimum present in the calculations  @xcite . to fill this minimum mesonic exchange currents",
    "have been introduced .",
    "the contributions of @xmath6- , @xmath7-currents , and @xmath8- configurations allow one to get a satisfactory agreement with the data  @xcite",
    ". the question of a consistent inclusion of all relativistic corrections ( at least for the pion sector ) has recently been addressed by ref .",
    "@xcite and supports the above statement",
    ". nevertheless , some conceptional problems of the theory still remain open questions . among them",
    "is the problem of gauge invariance and the question of the nucleon form factor to be chosen in the exchange currents contributions  @xcite .    by now",
    "some relativistic methods identify corrections like meson exchange currents in the relativistic impulse approximation .",
    "it has been shown that in the framework of the light - cone approach the so - called extra components @xmath9 of the deuteron wave function , and @xmath10 of the @xmath3-wave function introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite give an expression in the nonrelativistic limit , that analytically equals to the contribution of the pair current  @xcite . in this context",
    "the one iteration assumption that will be explained below for solving the dynamical equation is substantial .",
    "another important result in this context is the calculation of the static electromagnetic properties within the bethe - salpeter approach .",
    "it follows that the contribution of the @xmath0-states to the magnetic moment of the deuteron is numerically close to the contribution of mesonic currents and agrees in sign  @xcite .",
    "it has already been noticed earlier in the context of covariant reductions of the bethe - salpeter equation to three dimensional ones that negative energy components in the wave function are responsible for pair current type contributions , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we show that the suggested reduction procedure leads to the same _ analytical _ structure as the nonrelativistic pair current correction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : nonrel ] contains the general formulas for the deuteron disintegration amplitude in different representations .",
    "the static approximation is also discussed .",
    "the one iteration approximation is formulated in section  [ sec : oneit ] where we give reasons for its validity in simple models .",
    "the derivation of the main correction is done in the section  [ sec : emc ] .",
    "we present and discuss our results in section  [ sec : results ] , summarize and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "because of lorentz covariance , transformation properties under parity and time reversal as well as current conservation , the general structure of the transition matrix element for the @xmath11 transition current near threshold can be written as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the deuteron polarization four vector with projection @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the deuteron four momentum , @xmath16 is the four momentum transfer , @xmath17 is the squared total momentum of the @xmath18-pair , see fig .

    "the integration on @xmath63 can now be performed by choosing a proper integration contour and specifying the corresponding poles , e.g. , closing the upper half plane leads to poles for @xmath63 at @xmath64 .",

    "it plays an essential role in connecting the bethe - salpeter amplitudes and the usual nonrelativistic wave functions .",
    "this approximation allows us to express the final result in terms of the usual @xmath94- and @xmath95-wave functions of the deuteron and the @xmath94-wave function of @xmath18-pair .",
    "although numerically verified for deuteron - like models , the one iteration approximation needs further investigation .",
    "we argue that the validity is due to the small binding energy for the deuteron . from inspection of the next iterations",
    "we find additive corrections only",
    ".    therefore these assumptions can be loosen up and additional corrections can be taken into account .",
    "this way we have a possibility to calculate corrections in a more consistent way .",
    "this problem is present in both , electromagnetic and strong processes ( for @xmath211 and @xmath212 reactions , for instance ) .",
    "although the calculation of these corrections is important to arrive at definite conclusions about the covariant approach as a whole , our main issue here is to investigate the correspondence between the covariant approach and the mesonic exchange currents of the nonrelativistic approaches .",
    "we have shown the analytic correspondence of these different approaches .",
    "the pair correction plays an essential role in explaining the experimental data .",
    "an interesting result in this context is connected to the form factor entering in the pair current term .",
    "the overall form factor that is consistent with gauge independence and the relativistic ( covariant ) expansion neither coincides with @xmath213 nor with @xmath214 but requires an `` average '' between them .",
