    "abell 2597 is a relatively nearby ( @xmath7 ) , abell richness class 0 cluster of galaxies .",
    "rich in features , it has been studied extensively in many wavebands .",
    "the central cd galaxy contains the radio source pmn j2323 - 1207 ( pks b2322 - 12 ) @xcite .",
    "the total flux density of this source is @xmath8 at 1.5@xmath9 @xcite , and @xmath10 at 5.0@xmath9 @xcite , implying a fairly steep spectral index @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the source is physically small , @xmath13 at 1.5 , 5.0@xmath9 respectively .",
    "the source is only moderately resolved at these frequencies , but at the higher frequency has an elongated appearance suggesting a double - lobed structure . at 8.44@xmath9 @xcite",
    ", the source is resolved into a nucleus and two lobes ( @xmath14 across ) , orientated roughly ne  sw .",
    "a jet is clearly seen leading from the nucleus on the sw .",
    "this jet undergoes a sharp ( @xmath15 ) bend about 0.5@xmath16 from the nucleus . assuming a typical spectral index for the jets of @xmath17 , the inferred lobe spectral index is @xmath18 , suggestive of confinement and synchrotron ageing .",
    "very long baseline array ( vlba ) 1.3 , 5.0@xmath9 observations of the central 0.3@xmath16 @xcite show an inverted spectrum ( @xmath19 ) core , together with straight , symmetric jets emanating from both sides .",
    "abell 2597 has previously been observed in x - rays by various observatories , for example : _ einstein _ @xcite ; _ rosat _ @xcite ; _ asca _ @xcite ; _ chandra _ @xcite ; _ xmm - newton _ @xcite .",
    "traditionally , it has been classified as a moderately strong cooling flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) cluster , with inferred x - ray mass deposition rate ( @xmath20@xmath21 ) : @xmath22 ( _ rosat _ pspc ; * ? ? ? * @xmath23 ) ; @xmath24 ( _ asca _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "a short ( @xmath25 of good time ) _ chandra _ observation @xcite highlighted the interaction between the radio source and the x - ray gas , through the presence of so - called ` ghost cavities ' of low surface brightness , seemingly coincident with spurs of low frequency ( @xmath26 ) radio emission .",
    "such brightness depressions are believed to be buoyantly rising bubbles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) associated with a prior ( @xmath27 previously , in this case ) outburst of the central radio source .",
    "the small physical size of the radio source means , however , that these issues are not amenable to study with _ xmm - newton _ , given its @xmath28 point spread function ( psf ) .    in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ era of high spatial and spectral resolution",
    ", the cooling flow model is undergoing re - interpretation .",
    "the cause is quite simply an absence ( or at best a severe weakness ) of the spectral features expected from gas at the low - end ( @xmath29 , say ; though there does not appear to be a fixed absolute cut - off ) of the x - ray temperature regime in the observed spectra of cluster central regions .",
    "reductions in temperature by factors of a few ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with radius are seen .",
    "the expected emission lines for several important low - temperature species ( e.g.  the fe17 15 and 17 lines ) do not seem to be present at the levels predicted by simple models .",
    "this is a trend that appears to be repeated in many clusters that have traditionally been thought to harbour cooling flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "many explanations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for this effect have been put forward ; some involving suppression of the gas cooling , some involving departures from standard collisionally - ionized radiative cooling .",
    "after a flirtation with thermal conduction ( but see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , theoretical studies at present seem to be concentrated on some form of distributed heating from a central agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , effected by buoyant plasma bubbles .",
    "observations at ultra - violet ( uv ) wavelengths suggest that abell 2597 may be a particularly interesting object for study in light of these issues .",
    "abell 2597 , together with the @xmath30 cluster abell 1795 , was observed with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) mission by @xcite .",
    "_ fuse _ is sensitive to the o6 1032 , 1038@xmath4 resonance lines , which are strong diagnostics of thermally radiating gas at temperatures @xmath31 @xmath32@xmath33 . in a traditional cooling flow model ,",
    "in which the ultimate fate of the hot gas is to cool to very low temperatures , strong uv emission is expected in such lines as gas cools out of the x - ray temperature regime ; thereby potentially forming a bridge between the hot , x - ray emitting gas and the cool , @xmath34 ( see below ) radiating gas .",
    "o6 1032@xmath4 emission was detected in abell 2597 , with an inferred luminosity @xmath35@xmath36@xmath37 .",
    "using simple cooling - flow theory , @xcite calculate the associated mass flow - rate as 40@xmath20@xmath21 ( within the effective radius of the _ fuse _ aperture at this redshift , @xmath38 ) , for an intermediate case between the limits of isobaric and isochoric cooling .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "hri mass deposition rate of @xcite , @xmath39 within a cooling radius ( defined by @xmath40 ) @xmath41 , is around three times larger ( applying a simple linear @xmath42 scaling ) .",
    "the weakness of cluster cooling flows in comparison to the predictions of the traditional model is thus again demonstrated , but extended down to the uv regime .",
    "this under - luminosity at uv temperatures may be contrasted with the situation at @xmath34 temperatures , where the abell 2597 emission nebula ( see below ) , like other such nebulae , is over - luminous , even when compared to classical , high x - ray mass deposition rates @xcite .",
    "in contrast , abell 1795 was not detected in o6 .",
    "similarly , @xcite , also using _ fuse _ , were unable to detect o6 emission from either of the low redshift ( @xmath43 ) , low galactic column ( @xmath44 ) , rich clusters abell 2029 and abell 3112 .",
    "these results highlight the apparently unusual ( within the currently favoured non - cooling flow paradigm ) nature of abell 2597 , and motivate a more detailed x - ray study of its properties .",
    "the central ( @xmath45 in diameter ) regions of abell 2597 harbour an optical emission line nebula , as is often ( and exclusively ) the case in cooling flow clusters .",
    "the @xmath46 $ ] luminosity is @xmath47 , making it among the most luminous in the sample of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 luminosity is many ( @xmath48 ) times greater than that expected from extrapolating the classical @xmath49 x - ray mass flow rates down to @xmath50 , a general feature of such nebulae .",
    "the discrepancy is made even worse if the relative sizes of the nebulae and x - ray cooling regions are taken into account .",
    "the deep optical spectra of @xcite reveal that the abell 2597 nebula has @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and is significantly reddened by ( intrinsic , owing to the low galactic column ) dust .",
    "the low inferred column density @xmath54 relative to that of h1 suggests that thin ionized h2 layers surround cold neutral h1 cores .",
    "the nebula has a low ionization parameter , most species being only singly ionized .",
    "photoionization from hot stars is the only ionization mechanism not ruled out by the observations , but even the hottest o stars ( in isolation ) would not be able to heat the nebula to the observed temperature .",
    "some form of heat transfer from the intracluster medium ( icm ) may supply a comparable amount of energy to the nebula .",
    "the core of the central cd exhibits a significant blue optical excess ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "_ hst _ observations @xcite resolve this excess into continuum emission around and across the radio lobes , and several knots to the south - west .",
    "line - dominated ( thereby not optical synchrotron or inverse compton in origin ) excess appears in bright arcs around the edge of the radio lobes , and more diffusely across the lobe faces .",
    "such geometry is suggestive of an emission shell surrounding the radio lobes .",
    "a bright optical knot is also seen coincident with the southern radio hot - spot , consistent with a massive clump responsible for the deflection of the southern jet .",
    "the central region also shows strong dust obscuration , resolved into several large ( several hundred parsecs ) regions .    in the infra - red ,",
    "vibrational molecular hydrogen emission lines characteristic of @xmath31 10002000@xmath33 collisionally ionized gas have been detected from the innermost @xmath55 of the central cluster galaxy @xcite .",
    "as with the optical nebula , there is too much emission as compared to the expectation from even an inordinately massive classical cooling flow , and yet too little mass for this to be the final reservoir of a standard , long - lived flow .",
    "furthermore , the molecular gas is dusty , and therefore unlikely to be the direct condensate of the hot icm ( where dust is rapidly destroyed ) .",
    "again as with the optical light , there is a complex filamentary structure that seems to be spatially associated with the radio source .",
    "the optical and infra - red properties are both consistent with uv heating of the gas by a population of young , hot stars @xcite ( sfr @xmath31 few @xmath56 ) .",
    "abell  2597 also has a possible co detection @xcite ; indicative of very cold , molecular gas .",
    "the galactic column density in the direction of abell 2597 ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) has the relatively low value @xmath59@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that the @xmath61 limit on any fluctuation in the foreground h1 column in this direction , on scales @xmath62 , is @xmath63@xmath60 ( 17 per cent ) .",
    "intrinsic h1 21@xmath64 absorption towards the central radio source was detected by @xcite .",
    "a narrow ( @xmath65 ) , redshifted ( @xmath66 ) , spatially unresolved component coincident with the nucleus is inferred to be a gas clump falling onto the cd . a broad ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "spatially extended ( @xmath68 , i.e.  the size of the radio source ) component at the systemic velocity is consistent with being associated with the ( hence photon bounded ) @xmath34 .",
    "the inferred column densities and masses for the narrow and broad components are @xmath69 ; @xmath70 ; with @xmath71 the spin temperature in units of 100@xmath33 .",
    "intrinsic , redshifted h1 was also seen in the vlba observations of @xcite , and interpreted as a turbulent , inwardly streaming , atomic torus ( scale height @xmath72 ) centred on the nucleus .",
    "our chosen cosmology has @xmath73@xmath74@xmath37@xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "adopting a redshift @xmath78 ( see section  [ sec : rgs_redshift ] ) , the luminosity distance is @xmath79 , the angular diameter distance is @xmath80 , and the angular length scale is 2.08@xmath1@xmath81 .",
    "data processing was carried out using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas ) version 5.4.1 ( aka xmmsas_20030110_1802 ) .",
    "spectral analyses employed xspec version 11.3 . unless otherwise stated , quoted uncertainties are @xmath82 ( 68 per cent ) on a single parameter .",
    "abell 2597 was observed by _ xmm - newton _ on 2003 june 2728 ( observation i d 0147330101 ) , during revolution 0650 .",
    "the nominal length of the observation was 120@xmath0 , unfortunately the exposure was heavily affected by background flaring ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mos2rate ] ) .",
    "the thin optical blocking filter was applied to the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) .",
    "the mos @xcite and pn @xcite detectors were both operated in full frame mode .",
    "epic events files were regenerated from the observation data files ( odfs ) using the sas meta - tasks ` epchain ` and ` emchain ` . for ` emchain ` , standard options were used , except that bad pixel detection was switched on . `",
    "epchain ` was run in two steps in order to merge in the instrument house - keeping good time interval ( gti ) data ( which are otherwise ignored ) before the final events list was created",
    ".      the epic background is comprised of a number of components : proton , particle , photon .",
    "soft protons in the earth s magnetosphere scatter through the mirror system , and are responsible for periods of intense background flaring , where the instrument count rate can rise by orders of magnitude .",
    "such intervals can only be dealt with by excising them from further analysis using a rate - based gti filtering .",
    "energetic charged particles that pass through the detector excite fluorescent emission lines in several of the constituent components . the strong spatial variation of some components of this emission ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) makes it preferable to extract a background from the same region of the detector as the source . for the analysis of extended sources , the use of blank - sky background templates @xcite is therefore to be desired .    for abell 2597 , cluster emission is detected up to around 8 and 9@xmath6 in the mos and pn respectively .",
    "the pn exhibits strong fluorescence lines of ni , cu and zn around 8@xmath6 .",
    "the only non - negligible fluorescent line visible in the pn data below 8@xmath6 is the 1.5@xmath6 al line . unlike the cu ( for example ) line",
    ", this line does not vary spatially over the detector @xcite , since it originates in the camera housing .",
    "cutting off the spectra at 7.3@xmath6 removes very few counts , and means that the only background line remaining in the pn is not spatially varying .",
    "this frees us from the need to extract background spectra from the same spatial region of the pn detector , i.e.  enables us to use a local background .",
    "this is desirable because it removes the vagaries of scaling and varying cosmic background necessarily associated with the use of a blank - sky background ( see below ) ; and it allows us greater freedom in the filtering of background flares .",
    "additionally , comparison of the off - source pn spectra for the abell 2597 and blank - sky fields reveals that the 8@xmath6 fluorescence lines are shifted to a lower energy by about 20@xmath83 in the latter .",
    "this almost certainly represents a change in calibration between the processing of the blank - sky templates and our re - processing of the odfs for abell 2597 ( the effect of such a shift would of course be largely restricted to an increase in @xmath84 in those channels lying around the fluorescent line energies ) .",
    "the only significant fluorescent lines in the mos data are the al and si lines at 1.5 and 1.7@xmath6 respectively ( the cr , mn , and fe lines around 6@xmath6 are seen to be negligible ) . both of these features exhibit strong spatial variation @xcite over the mos field of view ( hereinafter fov ) . using a local background for the mos",
    "is therefore not as viable a proposition as it is for the pn .    in order to be able to make use of the blank - sky epic background templates of @xcite",
    ", we use the same form of filtering process as employed in the construction of those files .",
    "that is , we make a light - curve ( e.g.  fig .  [",
    "fig : mos2rate ] ) in 100@xmath85 time bins of the high energy ( ` pi > 10000 ` ) single pixel ( ` pattern = = 0 ` ) events across the whole detector .",
    "the standard xmm event selection flags ` # xmmea_em ` and ` # xmmea_ep ` are applied for the mos and pn respectively ( these exclude cosmic rays , events in bad frames , etc . ) .",
    "time bins .",
    "upper panel : total exposure , with rejected periods of high count - rate in grey , accepted periods in black .",
    "lower panel : only the selected good time interval ( gti ) is shown . ]",
    "our preferred filtering method is to form a histogram of the number of events in the 100@xmath85 time - bins of the light curve , fit the core of the distribution ( i.e. ignoring the high count - rate tail ) with a gaussian , and exclude periods where the count - rate lies more than @xmath86 away from the mean .",
    "unfortunately , for mos1 ( and the pn , but this is not an issue since we use a local background in this case ) the @xmath87 count - rate thresholds lie above the filtration limits used in the creation of the background events templates ( 0.2 and 0.45@xmath88@xmath37 for the mos and pn respectively ) . in order to make use of the mos1 background template we therefore apply the same absolute count - rate filtering to this instrument as was used to make the background events file . for mos2 ,",
    "the @xmath87 count - rate threshold is 0.13@xmath88@xmath37 , and this absolute value is used to filter both the observation events file , and to re - filter the background template events file to the same level . for the pn ,",
    "the @xmath89 count - rate threshold is 0.54@xmath88@xmath37 .    we strengthen the filtering by requiring that all gtis be at least 10 minutes long .",
    "the gti files are aligned on the frame boundaries of the relevant events files before being applied .",
    "the mean remaining ontime of the events files after filtering in this way are 39 ( pn ) , 37 ( mos1 ) , and 38@xmath0 ( mos2 ) .",
    "it is known that the particle background can vary from observation to observation at around the ten per cent level @xcite .",
    "we therefore scale the products ( images and spectra ) of the blank - sky mos events file before they are used to correct the source products .",
    "the scaling factor is obtained from the ratio of the count - rates outside the fov , where the only events should be the result of particle - induced fluorescence rather than from actual photons passing through the mirror system . in detail",
    ", we find the number of counts remaining in the gti - filtered data after applying the ` evselect ` filtering criterion ` # xmmea_16 & & flag & 0x766a0f63 = = 0 & & pi in [ 200:12000 ] & & pattern < = 12 ` , where the flag expression selects events outside the mos fov but with no other non - zero flag settings .",
    "combining this figure with the exposure time gives an out - of - fov count - rate which is used to normalize the background template products . in this way",
    ", we obtain scaling factors of 1.02 and 0.91 for the mos1 and mos2 backgrounds respectively . to allow for some uncertainty in the normalization ,",
    "we assign a 10 per cent systematic error to the blank - sky products , which is added in quadrature to the statistical errors .",
    "the sas task ` attcalc ` was used to reproject the blank - sky templates to the same sky position as the abell  2597 observation , so that the same sky coordinate selection expressions could be applied to both the science and background fields .    below 5@xmath6 or so ,",
    "the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) dominates @xcite over the internal camera background .",
    "if there were no significant variation of the cxb over the sky , then the blank - sky templates would also represent this background component . to allow for any changes in the cxb in the region of the target",
    ", a so - called double background subtraction approach can be used .",
    "the large field of view of _ xmm - newton _ , together with the redshift of abell 2597 , result in significant areas of the detectors being essentially free from cluster emission .",
    "this enables us to examine the background spectrum from such regions and compare it with those of the ( scaled ) blank - sky templates extracted from the same detector region . for this purpose we extracted spectra from an annulus lying between 7 and 10@xmath3 ( avoiding regions near the edge of the fov ) from the cluster centre , which we take to be located at the emission peak , in sky coordinates @xmath90 .",
    "non - icm sources in this region were excluded with circular masks of radius at least 30@xmath16 .",
    "the backscal fits header keys were corrected for the area so removed .    initial comparison of the spectra extracted from this region of the abell 2597 field reveals that the agreement with the blank - sky spectra scaled according to the out - of - fov count - rates is good ; despite the relatively poor quality of the science observation as a whole ( i.e. the heavy background flaring ) . there is something of a slight excess of soft ( @xmath91 ) counts in the abell 2597 field , but not to any great degree .    in summary , we use a local ( extracted from 710@xmath3 in radius ) background for the pn . for the mos",
    ", we use the blank - sky templates to deal with the spatially varying si and al background lines , corrected by a double - background subtraction approach to account for any ( minor ) variance in cxb between the science and background fields . for the mos",
    ", we make use of single , double , triple , and quadruple pixel events ( i.e. ` pattern \\leqslant 12 ` ) . for the pn",
    ", we use single and double events ( ` pattern \\leqslant 4 ` ) . in both cases only events with ` flag = = 0 ` are considered .",
    "when the pn is operated in full frame mode , as is the case here , bright sources can be significantly affected by so - called out of time ( oot ) events .",
    "these are caused by photons which arrive while the ccd is being read out ( charge shifted along columns towards the readout node ) .",
    "such events are assigned a wrong rawy coordinate and hence an improper cti ( charge transfer inefficiency ) correction . in an uncorrected image ,",
    "the oot events due to a strong source are visible as a bright streak smeared out in rawy .",
    "oot events act to broaden spectral features .",
    "oot events can only be corrected for in a statistical sense .",
    "we follow the standard procedure of re - running the sas meta - task ` epchain ` with the option ` withoutoftime = y ` passed to the ` epevents ` task .",
    "this generates an events file that consists entirely of oot events , distributed over the range of rawy present in the data .",
    "oot images and spectra can then be produced in the normal way , and scaled and subtracted from source images and spectra to correct them for the oot events .",
    "the appropriate scale factor is obtained from the expected fraction of oot events , which depends on the ratio of the readout time to the frame time . for the pn in full frame mode ,",
    "this is @xmath92 per cent ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) . a slight correction to this factor",
    "is needed because the version of ` epevents ` used does not take account of the fact that in pn full frame mode , the first 12 ( of 200 ) rows are marked as bad .",
    "accordingly , the correct scaling factor is @xmath93 per cent . in practice ,",
    "oot events make little difference to the pn spectral fits .",
    "the lower limit for the spectral fits was placed at 500@xmath83 for the mos ( following the advice of @xcite for post - revolution 450 data ; in any case the mos results are relatively insensitive to the adopted low - energy cut - off ) .",
    "for consistency ( and to avoid low - energy residuals ) the same limit was applied to the pn data .",
    "the high energy cut - off was placed at 7.3@xmath6 , slightly below the maximum detected energy from the cluster , to avoid the background pn fluorescence line complex at 8@xmath6 ( as described in section  [ sec : backgrnd ] ) .",
    "spectra were grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per channel to ensure applicability of the @xmath84 statistic .",
    "redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) were generated using the sas tasks ` rmfgen ` and ` arfgen ` respectively .",
    "rmfs were made using the standard sas parameters .",
    "arfs were made in extended - source mode , using a low - resolution detector - coordinate image of the spectral region .",
    "the image pixel size was chosen according to the size of the extraction region so as to adequately sample the variation in emission , bearing in mind that the version of ` arfgen ` employed does not model variations on scales @xmath94 .",
    "strictly speaking , the images should be exposure - weighted ( i.e.  de - vignetted ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we find this makes almost no difference in practice in this case .",
    "bad pixel locations were taken from the relevant events file .",
    "the approach of generating arfs appropriate to the emission pattern in the spectral extraction region differs from the ` weighting ' method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "obtained using the two approaches are negligible ( as per * ? ? ?",

    "we obtain weak ( 12@xmath99 ; below formal detection levels ) evidence for the three most important lines , and measure the power associated with each line ( see table  [ tab : rgs_line_fits ] ) . by comparing the line",
    "fluxes with those produced from a classical isobaric cooling flow model , we can estimate the corresponding mass - flow rate for each line .",
    "once again , we obtain values that are consistent with the 90@xmath20@xmath21 mark . fixing the relative strengths of the three fe lines to that predicted by the standard isobaric cooling flow model , and allowing the absolute normalization to vary",
    ", we obtain a fit suggesting the presence of fe17 at a significance of just over @xmath100 .",
    "we therefore establish , using three distinct methods , evidence for a cooling flow at a level @xmath101 .",
    "the preferred low - temperature cut - off for the flow , established from the rgs data , is essentially zero ( 0.081@xmath6 , the minimum temperature available in the xspec ` mekal ` model ) . a plot of the @xmath102@xmath103 confidence contours is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgs_contour ] .",
    "a re - analysis of the _ chandra _ data for abell  2597 @xcite , as described in section  [ sec : chandra_global ] , also supports the existence of a cooling flow at these levels , with a very small low - temperature cut - off ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : chandra_contour ] .",
    "this mass deposition rate is consistent with the results of @xcite , using _ fuse _ uv observations .",
    "these authors detected the o6 1032@xmath4 resonance line ( characteristic of gas at temperatures @xmath31 @xmath32@xmath33 ) in abell  2597 .",
    "converting the detected flux to an equivalent mass deposition rate gives a uv mass - deposition rate @xmath104 within the _ fuse _ effective radius of 40@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the x - ray results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot_cumu ] ) .",
    "in contrast , o6 was not detected in abell  1795 @xcite , nor in abell  2029 or abell  3112 @xcite .",
    "both from an x - ray and a uv standpoint , therefore , abell  2597 appears to be an atypical object .",
    "the combination of the _ xmm - newton _ x - ray and _ fuse _ uv results for abell  2597 suggests that it may harbour a classical cooling flow in which gas cools from @xmath31 4@xmath6 by at least two orders of magnitude in temperature .",
    "interestingly , a recent _ chandra _ analysis of abell  2029 @xcite shows that the x - ray data in this object are also consistent with a modest ( by traditional standards ) cooling flow extending down to very low temperatures , despite the lack of a uv detection .    among the many ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) explanations suggested for the ` cooling - flow problem ' , heating from a central agn , mediated by the rise of buoyant plasma bubbles through the icm , is a popular candidate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observation of abell  2597 @xcite showed it to contain x - ray surface brightness depressions , interpreted ( as a result of the extension of spurs of old , low - frequency radio emission ) as ` ghost cavities ' , associated with a radio outburst @xmath105@xmath106 ago .",
    "abell  2597 therefore appears to harbour a central agn that generates buoyant bubbles , and yet it also appears to contain gas cooling to very low temperatures .",
    "the process of bubble generation is necessarily an episodic one , and it therefore perhaps unreasonable to assume that a steady , time - independent state will be maintained .",
    "clusters may go through cycles of behaviour , in which cooling builds up to some level , then an agn outburst initiates a heating phase in which cooling is suppressed ( else massive cooling flows would be common phenomena ) .",
    "abell  2597 would then be an object near the ` cooling catastrophe ' point of the cycle .",
    "the relative frequency of such objects would depend on the relative timescales of the cooling and heating phases .",
    "the fact that such objects seem to be quite rare indicates that the phase of strong cooling is short - lived .",
    "such a mechanism would require coupling between the state of the icm and the activity of the central agn , in order that a feedback loop could be maintained .",
