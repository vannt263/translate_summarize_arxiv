    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is an amazingly successful model , accurately predicting all available experimental data ; however the model is still incomplete .",
    "the details of the electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) have continued to elude experimental verification . until there is experimental observation of the scalar higgs boson , the generation of masses for",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bosons , and the fermions , will remain a mystery .",
    "if the answer to these questions is to be found at a high energy scale , we may still be able to gain insight into the mechanism of the symmetry - breaking by studying the couplings of the known vector bosons and fermions at a some - what lower energy scale , for deviations from what is predicted by the sm .    in particular , the top quark @xcite , with its heavy mass of @xmath13 175 gev , the same order as the ewsb scale ( @xmath14gev ) may provide answers to these questions . as the heaviest of the fermions ,",
    "the top quark is unique , and may provide a useful probe of the ewsb sector , particularly if there is a connection between the generation of mass for the fermions and the ewsb . in this case , one expects some residual effects of this mechanism could appear in accordance with the mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "thus , new physics effects could be much more apparent in the top quark than in the other ( much lighter ) fermions of the theory .",
    "for this reason , it is very important to study the top quark s interactions , as they may provide information on new physics effects @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for the proposed linear collider ( lc ) is to shed light upon these questions . with a high center of mass energy ( @xmath15 1.5 tev ) and a large integrated luminosity ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "it is expected that there will be a few thousands of @xmath9 pairs and single-@xmath17 ( or single-@xmath18 ) events produced via vector boson fusion processes .",
    "thus , the lc will allow the couplings of the longitudinally polarized weak vector bosons to the top quark to be very accurately determined .    in this article",
    ", we expand upon previous work @xcite by including an analysis of signal and backgrounds for the production of @xmath0 through fusion of vector bosons , including the effects of possible anomalous dimension five operators .",
    "we show that at the lc the coefficients of these operators can be measured to order @xmath19 ( divided by the cut - off scale , @xmath20 tev ) . as a comparison ,",
    "the coefficients of the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) bosonic operators are usually determined to about an order of @xmath19 or @xmath21 ( divided by @xmath22 ) via @xmath23 processes @xcite .",
    "hence , the scattering processes @xmath24 at high energy may provide a more sensitive probe of some symmetry breaking mechanisms than @xmath23 , assuming that naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite holds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ couplings ]",
    "we present the relevant part of the effective lagrangian used in our study , and provide limits on the coefficients of the dimension five operators from partial wave perturbative unitarity . in section",
    "[ signature ] , we present a study of the production of @xmath9 with missing @xmath25 in the _ higgsless _ sm , including the effects of the operators under study .",
    "we show how one can use the total rate of this process , a study of the shape of rapidity distributions , and the polarization of the top quarks to constrain the operators to order @xmath19 .",
    "we also examine the gains one can arrive upon by polarizing the electron or positron beams , and find that an improvement of up to 50% can be obtained from a highly polarized electron beam .",
    "we wish to study new physics effects to @xmath0 production at the lc in a model - independent way , using the electro - weak chiral lagrangian ( ewcl ) . in the ewcl ,",
    "the su(2@xmath4 u(1@xmath5 gauge symmetry is realized non - linearly , and a scalar higgs boson is not required for a gauge - invariant theory @xcite .",
    "thus , we may study the couplings of the top quark to the gauge bosons without assuming that a higgs boson exists .",
    "for this reason , we refer to the theory without any `` new physics '' effects included as the _ higgsless _ sm .",
    "we include terms of dimension five in our effective lagrangian , and thus nda @xcite requires a cut - off scale , @xmath26 , below which the effective theory is valid .",
    "this scale could be identified with the lowest new heavy mass scale , or something around @xmath27 tev if no new resonances exist below @xmath26 . for the purposes of our study",
    ", we will assume @xmath28 tev , and obtain constraints on the coefficients of the dimension five operators .",
    "as discussed previously @xcite , there are 19 independent dimension five operators ( not including flavor - changing neutral current operators ) that involve the top quark and the gauge bosons in the nonlinear chiral lagrangian , fourteen of which can contribute to the @xmath29 process .",
    "however , in the expansion in powers of @xmath30 ( the energy of the @xmath0 system ) of the helicity amplitudes , only seven actually contribute to the leading terms ; all the others contribute at most to terms that are two powers below the leading ones .",
    "this means that in the high energy region , where the longitudinal components of @xmath11 and @xmath12 play the leading role , the effects of these operators are more likely to be observed . in the leading terms in the @xmath30 expansion , there are two types of contribution to the partial waves of the @xmath29 amplitudes : the s - wave and the p - wave . except for the _ derivative - on - fermion _",
    "operator @xcite , every operator contributes to either the s - wave or p - wave , but not to both .",
    "based on the previous discussion , and without any loss of generality , we will simplify our study of anomalous effects of dimension five operators on the production of @xmath9 pairs at the lc by considering the two contact operators of our previous work @xcite .",
    "these two operators can serve as good representatives of each class of operators , the scalar coupling ( i.e. @xmath31 ) for those that contribute to the s - wave , and the tensor coupling ( i.e. @xmath32 ) for those that contribute to the p - wave .",
    "therefore , the part of the effective non - linear su(2@xmath4 u(1@xmath5 chiral lagrangian that is relevant for our study is :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the parameter which characterizes the scalar coupling , and @xmath35 characterizes the tensor coupling .    the leading terms in the @xmath30 expansion of the @xmath36 helicity amplitudes ( including both the contributions from the _ higgsless _ sm and the anomalous dimension five terms ) are : @xmath37    as mentioned before , nda gives an estimate for the scale @xmath26 to be of order @xmath38 and the coefficients @xmath39 to be of order one as @xmath40 , @xmath41 as @xmath42 , and fermion fields as @xmath43 .",
    "hence , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are also counted as @xmath42 .",
    "after this counting , one should multiply the result by @xmath47 .",
    "notice that up to the order of intent , the kinetic term of the gauge boson fields and the mass term of the fermion fields are two exceptions to the nda , and are of order @xmath40 . ] .",
    "given the strong dependance on the energy of the process ( @xmath48 ) it is natural to ask for the limits on the strength of the couplings to prevent violation of perturbative unitarity .",
    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ amplitudes ] ) , the coupling @xmath34 contributes only to the s - wave , whereas @xmath35 contributes to the p - wave .",
    "applying the method given in refs .",
    "@xcite for partial wave analysis , we consider the leading contributions ( that grow with any power of @xmath30 ) to the coupled channel matrices for @xmath49 and @xmath50 in order to obtain perturbative unitarity constraints on @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the best constraints will come from the highest eigenvalues .",
    "writing the coupled channels in the order @xcite @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the @xmath49 coupled channel partial wave matrix is @xmath54 \\ ; ,   \\nonumber\\ ] ] where , @xmath55 and the largest eigenvalues are @xmath56 . similarly ,",
    "if we write the coupled channels in the order @xcite @xmath57 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath58 , then the coupled channel partial wave matrix for @xmath50 is @xmath59   \\ ; ,   \\nonumber\\ ] ] where , @xmath60 and the largest eigenvalues are @xmath61 .    from the largest eigenvalues , we derive the most stringent constraints by requiring the magnitude of each eigenvalue to be less than unity .",
    "the resulting bounds are @xmath62 where we have used @xmath63tev and @xmath64tev for a 175gev top quark .",
    "hence , in our numerical analysis , we restrict the magnitude of the anomalous couplings @xmath39 to be within 1.0 so that the tree level perturbative calculation does not violate the unitarity condition .",
    "the coupling , appearing in the @xmath53 fusion process will generate a @xmath9 pair in the central region of the detector with missing transverse momentum carried away by the neutrinos produced by the charged leptonic current [ cf .",
    "[ diagan ] ] .",
    "as this process also appears in the _ higgsless _ sm , what we hope to observe is actually an interference between the diagrams containing the anomalous couplings and those from _ higgsless _",
    "let us analyze the latter for the moment , and then examine the effects of the operators in section [ wwtteffect ] .",
    "the _ higgsless sm _",
    "prediction for the process @xmath65 with missing @xmath25 consists dominantly of two subprocesses : one in which the missing @xmath25 is carried by two neutrinos , and the other where it is carried by a particle ( i.e. , a hard photon ) which escapes detection .",
    "in the _ higgsless _ sm there are 19 tree level diagrams for the process",
    "there are three @xmath53 _ fusion _ diagrams which , at high energies tev @xmath67 , the masses of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 bosons . ]",
    "are the most important contributions , along with six @xmath11 _ exchange _ diagrams of a lower magnitude [ cf .",
    "[ diagsm](a ) and ( b ) respectively ] .",
    "( these nine diagrams form a gauge invariant subset ) .",
    "the set of 10 diagrams in fig .",
    "2(c ) contribute to less than about one percent of the total @xmath68 rate after imposing the kinematic cuts ( cf .",
    "( [ cutseq ] ) ) for suppressing the @xmath69 background of the invisible particle system ( i.e. the @xmath70 pair ) to further suppress the background at the expense of some signal rate .",
    "however , in our analysis , we shall not impose such a cut to retain enough statistics . ] .",
    "since our signal consists of a @xmath9 pair with missing transverse momentum ( carried by the neutrinos ) , we also must consider the background process ( at order @xmath71 ) @xmath72 [ cf .",
    "[ diagpho ] ] , where the photon escapes the range covered by the detector , but is sufficiently hard to generate the required missing @xmath25 .",
    "the pictured diagrams correspond to initial state radiation ( isr ) .",
    "there are also contributions due to final state radiation ( fsr ) , where a photon is radiated from the @xmath17 or @xmath18 in the final state , but these contributions are suppressed by the heavy top mass and thus provide a negligible effect .    using a monte - carlo program to calculate the total cross section for the @xmath66 process , we compare the results with the ones obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the effective @xmath11 approximation method was applied and a total cross section @xmath73  fb was obtained . in that calculation only the longitudinal components of the massive @xmath11 bosons were considered , as well as the leading terms in powers of @xmath30 for the helicity amplitudes @xmath74 . by applying the same requirements",
    "as used in the effective @xmath11 study , we can compare our exact calculations to see how well the effective @xmath11 approximation works in this process .",
    "namely , we require the invariant mass of the @xmath9 system to be @xmath75  gev and the rapidity and the transverse momentum of @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be @xmath76 and @xmath77gev , respectively . from the complete matrix element calculation ,",
    "we obtain a similar value of 2.2 fb for the total cross section . comparing this with the @xmath78  fb obtained from the effective @xmath11 approximation",
    ", we conclude that the effective @xmath11 approximation provides an accurate estimate of the total cross section in this kinematic region to about 10% .    in order to suppress the background from the isr subprocess of @xmath79 ,",
    "we have found it essential to require that the @xmath0 system have a minimum of transverse momentum , @xmath80gev . because this isr subprocess dominantly produces photons approximately co - linear with the beam axis",
    ", this constraint will remove much of the background .",
    "any photon with polar angle @xmath81 less than 0.15 rad and energy more than @xmath82 gev will not be removed by this cut .",
    "roughly speaking , only @xmath83 of the initial state radiation carries this ( or more ) energy @xcite .",
    "thus we are effectively cutting out most of the isr background , which nonetheless remains the order of the @xmath53 fusion _ higgsless _ sm cross section ( @xmath84  fb ) .    after imposing the minimal set of constraints : @xmath85 we find that the cross section for @xmath86 is about 4.0 fb in the _ higgsless _ sm .",
    "this indicates that the effective @xmath11 approximation used in @xcite estimated the total rate for @xmath9 production via @xmath53 fusion at the lc by about a factor of 2 too small pairs meet the requirement @xmath75gev associated with the effective w approximation .",
    "the transverse @xmath11 boson contributions were not included in the previous work @xcite , but are included here using the exact scattering amplitudes . ] . however , as we shall show",
    ", this will not have a large effect on the limits which can be obtained on @xmath39 by studying the total rate for @xmath9 with missing @xmath25 at the lc , particularly when the isr contribution to the background is included .",
    "the two type of processes , @xmath87 by @xmath53 fusion , and @xmath69 by @xmath10 anihilation , have different distributions in several kinematical variables .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ yttsm ] we show the rapidity ( @xmath88 ) of the @xmath9 system for each subprocess . for the isr process , which is a two - to - three process",
    ", the rapidity has a minimum absolute value of about 0.18 ; this means that the @xmath9 pair must have a minimum thrust toward the beam axis .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that the emitted photon , which must be directed close to the beam axis in order to escape detection , must carry enough energy in order to generate the required missing @xmath25 , and consequently the @xmath9 system is boosted . on the other hand , the @xmath53 fusion mechanism prefers the @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be produced in the rapidity region close to zero .",
    "another important difference between these processes is their dependence on the polarization of the initial electron and positron beams . for @xmath53 fusion",
    "the only non - zero contribution comes from a purely left - handed electron and a purely right - handed positron coupling and the fact that the electron can be treated as massless at @xmath89 tev . ] .",
    "the rate for polarized @xmath90 or @xmath91 beams can be written in terms of the rate for unpolarized beams by using the relation , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the unpolarized beam rate ( determined to be 4 fb after imposing the minimal cuts described above ) , and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) are the fractional left ( right ) polarization of the electron ( positron ) beams respectively . on the other hand , for @xmath96 production",
    "the vector coupling also allows for contribution from a right ( left ) handed electron ( positron ) .",
    "therefore , to enhance the signal - to - background ratio we should consider the possibility of enhancing the @xmath53 fusion with an @xmath91 ( @xmath90 ) beam with some degree of left ( right ) handed polarization . in fig .",
    "[ pole ] we show the ratio of the total cross sections of these two processes as a function of the left - handed polarization of the electron beam , and for three different values of right - handed polarization of the positron beam .",
    "apart from the expected reduction of @xmath97 relative to the size of @xmath98 for higher degrees of polarization , there are two things that can be noticed from fig .",
    "first , for higher degrees of ( left - handed ) polarization of the electron beam there is no substantial reduction in the ratio @xmath99 if we also increase the positron s right - handed polarization .",
    "second , for the case of an unpolarized positron beam the rate of reduction of the ratio falls off as one polarizes the electron beam more and more . in other words , there is more progress in the relative reduction of @xmath100 as one sets the electron s polarization from 0 to 0.5 than from 0.5 to 1.0 . as a consequence of this , the best improvements in the bounds of the anomalous couplings @xmath34 and @xmath35 take place in the lower degrees of polarization ( assuming that no significant deviation from the sm prediction is observed ) . in fig .",
    "[ boundspol ] we show the improvement of the bounds for @xmath34 and @xmath35 depending on the polarization of the electron beam ( assuming an unpolarized positron beam ) . from this study",
    "we see that an improvement of about 43% for @xmath34 and 11% for @xmath35 results when one considers the constraint obtained from an unpolarized beam compared to that which is possible from a completely polarized beam .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that a polarized electron beam can be an important and useful tool in probing this type of new physics effect at the lc .",
    "one more feature that distinguishes the two subprocesses is the polarization of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks .",
    "should it turn out to be experimentally feasible to measure the polarizations of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 , this information can also be used to separate the two subprocesses . in @xmath53 fusion",
    "we find the parallel helicities ( equal sign ) final states to dominate over the antiparallel ones .",
    "on the other hand , for the isr sub - process we find that the opposite is true .",
    "to illustrate this point , we show in fig .",
    "[ yttsmpol ] the contributions to the rapidity distributions from the various @xmath17 and @xmath18 polarization combinations .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the anomalous couplings may be discovered or constrained by examining their effect upon the total production rate of @xmath9 pairs at the lc . in fig . [ events ]",
    "we show the total number of @xmath53 fusion events expected at the lc with integrated luminosity @xmath16 , as a function of the anomalous operator couplings , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we can use these results to obtain bounds on @xmath34 and @xmath35 at the 95%  c.l .",
    ", provided no new physics effects are observed at the lc . in table [ bounds ] , we present the constraints on @xmath34 and @xmath35 from the total rate estimated in @xcite , as well as the more realistic bounds obtained in this work , including the isr process @xmath96 discussed above , and the intrinsic _ higssless _ sm background processes .",
    "we find that the two results are in agreement to within a factor of two , though the more realistic estimation does suffer in some cases when the @xmath96 background is included .",
    "however , as we have discussed above , the background from @xmath96 has different rapidity distributions from the @xmath53 fusion process we wish to study . in figs .",
    "[ ytop ] , [ ytbar ] , and [ rapdiff ] we show that the effects of operators can modify the shape of these distributions .",
    "thus , by examining the effect on the shape of the rapidity distributions , we find that it is possible to improve the bounds obtained by studying the total cross section . because the contribution of the scalar operator ( @xmath34 ) is largely s - wave , as is the sm contribution , the scalar operator does not have a large effect on the rapidity distributions of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or the @xmath9 system .",
    "thus we find that the bounds on @xmath34 improve only slightly .",
    "for the tensor operator ( which contributes to the p - wave ) we find a larger effect , and there is a significant improvement on the lower constraint on @xmath35 . in particular , we find that the effect of the tensor operator is to shift the rapidity distribution of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 in opposite directions [ cf . figs .",
    "[ ytop ] , [ ytbar ] , and [ rapdiff ] ] . for this reason it is useful to look at the distribution of @xmath101 in order to constrain @xmath35 .",
    "-0.06 in    .the @xmath8 c.l .",
    "limits on @xmath34 and @xmath35 obtained from studying the total @xmath9 production rate at the lc and from @xmath102 analysis of the effects on the distributions of @xmath88 and @xmath101 .

    "[ ydiffpolx2 ] and fig .",
    "[ yttpolx2 ] respectively . at the 95% c.l . , we find that the constraints on @xmath34 do not change appreciably , because the scalar operator does not have a large effect on the shape of the rapidity distributions , while those on @xmath35 are improved some - what by the @xmath101 analysis .",
    "these results are summarized in table [ boundspol2 ] .",
    "in this paper , we present a complete , realistic calculation of the rate for producing @xmath9 pairs at the lc , an @xmath10 collider with @xmath105 tev and @xmath106 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we have considered both @xmath107 and @xmath96 production , within the frame - work of the the _ higgsless _ standard model , an effective theory in which the su(2@xmath4 u(1@xmath5 gauge symmetry is realized non - linearly . in order to parameterize the effect of `` new physics '' coming from a high energy scale , we include the possibility of anomalous dimension five local operators .",
    "we have chosen to focus on a scalar ( @xmath31 ) and a tensor ( @xmath32 ) operator as representative terms in the effective lagrangian which contribute to scattering amplitudes at energy order @xmath48 , in the s - wave and p - wave channels respectively . comparing the rate for @xmath108 to previous work @xcite , in which the effective @xmath11 approximation was used to estimate this rate , we find that the effective @xmath11 method is in good agreement with the full calculation ( to within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "we found that by studying the total production rate , it is possible to constrain a dimension five anomalous scalar coupling by @xmath109 , and a tensor coupling by @xmath110 .",
    "however , one can hope to improve these bounds by considering the effect of the operators on the rapidity distributions @xmath88 and @xmath111 to @xmath112 0.12 and @xmath113 0.2 .",
    "in addition , since the deviations from the _ higgsless _ sm distributions depend on @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we can use the @xmath102 analysis to decide whether the anomalous effect comes from the scalar coupling , the tensor coupling , or from both .",
    "we have also studied the improvements in constraining @xmath34 and @xmath35 resulting from a polarized electron and/or positron beam .",
    "we find that an improvement of about 43% in the bounds on @xmath34 and 11% in the bounds on @xmath35 result when the electron beam is 100% polarized , and that no large further improvement is expected if the positron beam is also polarized .",
    "should it prove experimentally feasible to reconstruct the polarization of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we can hope to further improve these bounds . by considering the rapidity distributions of @xmath103 and @xmath104 separately",
    ", one can hope to achieve the constraints @xmath114 and @xmath115 . finally , because the scalar operator does not contribute to the @xmath104 channel , one can also use measurements of the polarized production rates to determine directly which operator is responsible for an observed new physics effect , should an excess in the @xmath9 with missing @xmath25 rate be observed at the lc .",
    "thus , we conclude that the lc would provide an excellent experiment for probing anomalous couplings , and thus could provide key information on the details associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , should a light higgs boson fail to be discovered .",
