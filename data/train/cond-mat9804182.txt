    "recently the role of the orbital degrees of freedom in strongly correlated electron systems is attracting growing interest .",
    "the increase of this attention is stimulated by the progress in the experimental studies of transition metal and rare earth compounds such as @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , which show various interesting properties associated with the orbital degrees of freedom .    in",
    "the 1970 s kugel and kohmskii@xcite and inagaki@xcite studied an orbitally degenerate model to understand the magnetic structures of transition metal compounds within the mean field theory .",
    "they concluded that if orbitals ordered antiferromagnetically , then spins ordered ferromagnetically , and vice versa .",
    "recently shiina , shiba , and thalmeier@xcite have studied similar models in connection with a quadrupolar ordering of ceb@xmath2 and discussed the phase diagram under an external magnetic field neglecting quantum fluctuations .    in the case of @xmath3 , the orbital ordering temperature , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 775 k ) , is much higher than the nel temperature , @xmath6 ( @xmath5 141 k ) , so the mean field theoretical approaches are considered to be a good starting point . on the other hand , for @xmath7 , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 3.4",
    "k ) is the same order as @xmath6 ( @xmath5 2.3 k ) and thus the interplay between spin and orbital quantum fluctuations may be important .",
    "therefore it is necessary to consider the effects of quantum fluctuations more seriously beyond the mean field theory .    before considering the effects of the orbital degrees of freedom",
    ", we briefly summarize the properties of the one - dimensional single orbital hubbard model for comparison . in the limit of strong correlation at half filling , the model is reduced to the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model with su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "this model is well known as a typical quantum critical system .",
    "the ground state of this model is singlet ( @xmath8 $ ] in young s diagram representation ) and the elementary excitations are gapless and triplet ( @xmath9 $ ] ) , so - called des cloizeaux - pearson modes@xcite",
    ". these results are consistent with the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem,@xcite which states that the half - integer-@xmath10 spin chain , which has the translational and rotational symmetries , either has a singlet ground state with gapless excitations or has a finite gap with degenerate ground states , corresponding to spontaneous breaking of the parity .    in the present paper",
    "we study an effective model of an orbitally degenerate hubbard model in one dimension . by the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )",
    "method and exact diagonalization ( lanczos method ) , we find a quantum critical state at the su(4 ) symmetric point , which originates from the strong interplay between spin and orbital quantum fluctuations in one dimension .",
    "we start from the one - dimensional orbitally twofold degenerate hubbard model with hund rule coupling between the two orbitals at the same site .",
    "this is the simplest model which possesses orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "hamiltonian of this model is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes an electron creation ( annihilation ) operator with orbital @xmath14(=1,2 ) and spin @xmath15 at the @xmath16th site , and @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes electron spin operator with orbital @xmath14 at the @xmath16th site . concerning the hopping matrix elements , the nearest neighbor hopping between the same type of orbitals",
    "is assumed , @xmath20 .",
    "the simplest system which shows this property is illustrated in fig.[model_fig ] : the @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals along a chain parallel to the @xmath23 axis .",
    "we are interested in the case where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are positive .    to study the region of strong correlation",
    ", we consider the limit of @xmath27 at quarter filling . in this case",
    "charge degrees of freedom are suppressed and the system becomes a mott insulator .",
    "the effective hamiltonian obtained by the usual second order perturbation is @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the spin operators and @xmath30 are the pseudospin operators which describe the orbital degrees of freedom . in the above equations",
    "@xmath31 are the pauli spin matrixes .    as a first step ,",
    "we consider the case with the highest symmetry by taking the @xmath32 limit",
    ". then @xmath33 becomes , neglecting a constant term , @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 + 1/2 , and @xmath37 + 1/2 .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are the spin-1/2 and the pseudospin-1/2 exchange operators between the @xmath16th and ( @xmath16 + 1)-th sites , respectively .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ heff2 ] ) exchanges both @xmath10 and @xmath40 spins at the same time , the spin and orbital degrees of freedoms are combined into the su(4 ) spin ( denoted by @xmath41 ) and @xmath33 is described by using spin-3/2 exchange operators as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 the hamiltonian clearly has the su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "we call this hamiltonian the su(4 ) exchange hamiltonian .",
    "the exact ground state energy and the dispersion relations of the su(4 ) exchange hamiltonian have been already obtained by the application of the bethe ansatz technique to the higher spin - chain problems@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this model as the coupled spin and orbital system with the strongest orbital quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is worth noting that the su(4 ) exchange hamiltonian may play a similar role as the su(2 ) af heisenberg model for the single orbital hubbard model .",
    "the assumptions that the hoppings of electrons are possible only between the same orbitals and the vanishing @xmath26 produce this su(4 ) symmetry , independently of the strength of the coulomb repulsion @xmath25 .",
    "generally speaking , in real materials the hund rule coupling @xmath26 is not small .",
    "however , an understanding of the most symmetric case will be important for future studies of less symmetric cases corresponding to a finite @xmath26 .",
    "to understand the physics of the present model , let us consider @xmath10 and @xmath40 spins as classical spins .",
    "the spin configurations where every adjacent two , either @xmath10 or @xmath40 , spins point the opposite direction have the lowest energy . thus the classical ground state energy is zero and the degeneracy of the ground states is macroscopic in the classical theory .",
    "this situation is different from usual orbital and/or spin orderings discussed so far .",
    "thus it is essential to examine the properties of hamiltonian ( [ hsu4 ] ) by unbiased methods .",
    "first , we calculate the ground state energy ( @xmath44 ) by the dmrg method@xcite in the subspace of @xmath45=(0,0 ) , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we take @xmath48 as the energy unit and use here the open boundary conditions ( obc ) to obtain sufficient accuracy by the dmrg method .",
    "the obtained results are shown in fig.[gs_gap ] , which shows that the ground state energy per site ( @xmath49 ) and the surface energy are equal to @xmath500.825 and 0.35(3 ) , respectively .",
    "this ground state energy is , of course , consistent with that obtained by the bethe ansatz , @xmath51  @xcite .    in fig.[gs_gap ]",
    "the ground state energies are plotted only for @xmath52 , for which the minimum energy in the subspace of @xmath45=(1,1 ) is different from @xmath44 . from table",
    "i it is seen that the subspace @xmath45=(0,0 ) is included in every irreducible representation , but @xmath45=(1,1 ) belongs to any irreducible representation except for @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "thus it is concluded that the ground state belongs to the @xmath53 $ ] irreducible representation in the young s diagram notation .",
    "similarly , by calculating the ground state energies with changing @xmath45 , it is found that for @xmath54 the ground states belong to either @xmath55 $ ] or @xmath56 $ ] , which are degenerate 10- and 6-fold , respectively ( see table i ) .",
    "these quantum numbers can be understood from the point of view of maximum antisymmetrization .",
    "that is , the irreducible representations thus obtained for the ground states are compatible with the simple fact that the more antisymmetric part one irreducible representation has , the lower is its ground state energy in the subspace , because the hamiltonian ( [ hsu4 ] ) is the sum of su(4 ) exchange operators . to avoid complications coming from the degenerate ground states , we consider the systems of @xmath52 in the following . in this case",
    "the ground state belongs to the @xmath53 $ ] and is a singlet .",
    "since the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem applies to this model , the excitations are expected to be gapless , provided that no other symmetry is broken , in the same way as the spin-1/2 af heisenberg model with su(2 ) symmetry .    to estimate the excitation energy , we calculate the ground state energy and the first excited state energy by using the dmrg method for @xmath57 and by the exact diagonalization ( lanczos method ) for @xmath58 .",
    "we determine the ground state energy and the first excited energy by the minimum energies of the states whose quantum numbers @xmath45 are specified : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , etc .",
    "it is found that the first excited state belongs to @xmath61 $ ] .    though the dmrg is more suitable for obc than periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , here we apply the pbc in order to study the properties in the bulk limit .",
    "when we use the obc , we get lower excitation energies than those shown in the inset of fig.[gs_gap ] , but they correspond to excitations at the surfaces rather than those in bulk . from the inset of fig.[gs_gap ] we can conclude that the excitation gap @xmath62 goes to zero as @xmath63 .    in order to examine the properties of the excitations in more detail , we calculate the dispersion relation by using the lanczos method with the use of translational symmetry for the systems with the pbc .",
    "figure [ disp ] shows that the excitation spectrum has a `` bactrian camel '' structure and shows softening at @xmath64 .",
    "this structure is also known by the bethe ansatz results  @xcite .",
    "corresponding to the softening at @xmath64 , the correlation functions would show a characteristic feature , namely , oscillatory behaviors with a period of four , which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "figure [ disp ] shows that height of the left hump is always lower than that of the right one . to consider a possible reason , we determine the irreducible representation of each state for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "quantum numbers assigned for each @xmath67 point in the dispersion curves are shown in fig.[disp ] by the su(4 ) young s diagram representations . in these finite size calculations , the state at @xmath64 and left part of the two humps always belongs to @xmath61 $ ] and the right one to @xmath68 $ ] . from table",
    "i , the first excited states at @xmath64 consist of the coupled spin and orbital excitations in addition to the pure spin and orbital excitations and have the @xmath69-fold degeneracy in total .",
    "the difference of the height of the two humps may be attributed to the difference of the irreducible representations of the two humps .",
    "in fact , the left ( lower ) hump belongs to the irreducible representation which has a more antisymmetric part than that of the right ( higher ) one . in the bulk limit , however , we expect that the two parts , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , converge to the same dispersion relation as is known by the bethe ansatz solution@xcite .",
    ".irreducible representations of the su(4 ) symmetry given by young s diagrams ( yd ) and their relations to @xmath72 and @xmath73 representations[9 ] , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath73 are the magnitudes of the @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath79 is the degeneracy of each representations . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "now we move on to the behaviors of the correlation functions , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 denotes expectation values for the ground state .",
    "since hamiltonian ( [ heff2 ] ) has rotational symmetry with respect to both @xmath10 and @xmath40 spins , we consider only @xmath23 components of spins .",
    "we use the obc to get better accuracy in the dmrg calculations , but in this case we must keep in mind that the data contain the effects from boundaries .",
    "@xmath82 shows an oscillatory behavior with a period of four as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "but the correlation functions also vary with a period of four with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "that is , @xmath84 is equal to @xmath85 for any @xmath86 .",
    "this behavior is caused by the standing wave with a period of four originating from the open boundaries .",
    "to remove such an artifact due to the obc , we average @xmath87 for one period with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "thus we define an approximate bulk correlation function as follows : @xmath88 after this averaging procedure , we get the natural behavior of the correlation functions as shown in fig.[corr ] .    because the results discussed in the previous section show that this model is gapless , we try to fit the envelope of @xmath89 data with a power - law function ( @xmath90 ) by the least mean square method and get critical exponent @xmath14 equal to 1.80 or 1.55 depending on using either the upper ( @xmath91 16 , and 20 ) or the lower ( @xmath92 , 18 , and 22 ) data .",
    "we did not use the data of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , because these sites are too close to the boundary . due to finite size effects",
    ", the value of @xmath14 depends on how to fit , but @xmath14 is always between 1.5 and 2.0 . from these results",
    ", we conclude that the asymptotic form of the correlation function is given by @xmath95 in the bulk limit .    of course",
    ", @xmath89 is equal to @xmath96 , because of the symmetry of hamiltonian ( [ heff2 ] ) concerning the exchange between @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath99 always equals zero as is easily shown by the wigner - eckart theorem .",
    "in fact , the calculated values of @xmath100 are almost zero , and the numerical errors for the values of @xmath89 may be estimated from these values , which are less than @xmath101 even at the farthest site from @xmath16 .",
    "next we study the structure factor defined by @xmath102 as is seen in fig.[sq ] , @xmath103 has a characteristic cusp structure at @xmath64 .",
    "this result is consistent with the softening at @xmath64 in the dispersion relation . by fourier transformation of eq.([asympt ] ) , the analytic form of @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 around @xmath64 , when @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath14 is greater than 2 , eq.([anasq ] ) does not show any cusp structure at @xmath64 .",
    "so @xmath14 must be less than @xmath106 , since we clearly see the cusp structure of @xmath103 which becomes sharper as the system size is increased .    by the su(4 ) conformal field theory , the critical exponent of the su(4 ) spin correlation functions with @xmath64 oscillations is obtained to be 3/2@xcite , which is consistent with the present numerical result .",
    "although the correlation functions discussed in this paper are the @xmath10-spin correlation functions but not the su(4 ) spin correlation functions , we can show that the exponent is the same for the two correlation functions .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the quantum critical state for the coupled spin - orbit system .",
    "the quantum numbers of the ground state and the lowest branch of the excitations are determined .",
    "furthermore , the spin - spin correlation functions are obtained explicitly for the first time by the dmrg method .",
    "it shows a power - law decay with a period of four , which originate from the interference between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the exponent of the asymptotic behavior is consistent with the prediction by the conformal field theory . in this paper",
    "we have investigated only the most symmetric model , but it is more realistic to consider a model with lower symmetry corresponding to a finite @xmath26 .",
    "in such a case the effective hamiltonian is given by the @xmath10-spin isotropic and @xmath40-spin ising - type hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , whose properties are not yet fully understood .",
    "related to the su(4 ) model , several models with lower symmetries have been studied@xcite .",
    "kawano and takahashi@xcite discussed @xmath10-spin isotropic and @xmath40-spin @xmath107-type hamiltonians to study the three - leg antiferromagnetic heisenberg ladder and showed that such a model is gapfull and has exponentially decaying correlation functions .",
    "kolezhuk and mikeska@xcite studied a special su(2)@xmath108su(2 ) symmetric hamiltonian @xmath109 and showed that this model is also gapfull .",
    "it may be possible to study the properties of these models in a unified way by introducing different type of anisotropies from the su(4 ) symmetric point .",
    "for this purpose , it is highly desirable to develop an analytic theory around this symmetric point .",
    "we would like to thank norio kawakami for pointing out the exact results of the su(4 ) model and many helpful comments .",
    "thanks are also due to manfred sigrist for valuable discussions .",
