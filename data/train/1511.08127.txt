    "<S> the qcl has a ridge width of 4 @xmath0 m , is single mode , and emits dominantly transverse magnetic ( y polarized ) mid - ir radiation with wavelength of approximately 4.8 @xmath0 m . the sinusoidal corrugation of the ridge forms a first order distributed - feedback ( dfb ) grating that leads to single longitudinal mode operation of the laser . </S>",

    "<S> the simulation assumes periodic boundary condition for the hexagonal unit cell shown as inset in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the norm of the reciprocal lattice vectors of the array are smaller than the wavenumber in both sapphire and air ; therefore , the array is non - diffracting for normal incidence . as fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the array of metasurface lenses was mounted approximately 300 @xmath0 m away from the laser facet ( as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qcl]c ) , and a lens was aligned to the laser to obtain a collimated output beam . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse intensity of the beam was recorded at different locations along the beam propagation axis ( z axis ) using an infrared camera ( electrophysics pv320 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a neutral density filter was inserted before the camera to avoid saturation . </S>",

    "<S> note that @xmath2 values for collimated single mode diode lasers are typically in the range of 1.1 to 1.7  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> using a calibrated thermopile detector , the output power of the dfb - qcl was measured to be 11.4 mw directly at the emission facet . with the metasurface lens in place and </S>",
    "<S> the detector placed 5 cm from the lens , the output power was measured to be 9.0 mw , corresponding to a total transmission efficiency of 79% . </S>",
    "<S> the power meter had an input aperture diameter of 1.8 cm , and was zeroed to the background with the laser off . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that some of the power detected by the power meter might have passed through the lens without being diffracted and collimated by the lens . </S>",
    "<S> based on the laser s far - field emission profile ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : qcl]b ) , the distance between the laser and the power meter , and the power meter aperture size , we find that 8.2% of the total laser power would reach the power meter when the lens is removed . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an upper limit for the possible non - diffracted optical power that might have been detected by the power meter ; therefore , we estimate that the collimation efficiency is larger than 70.8% . considering that 87% of the qcl emission passes through the lens aperture , assuming 96% transmission for the posts ( average of the simulated transmission values presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lens_design](c ) ) , and taking into account @xmath106% reflection at the sapphire / air interface at the backside of the substrate , we obtain expected efficiency of @xmath1079% which agrees well with the measured value .    in summary , we proposed and experimentally demonstrated efficient dielectric metasurface mid - ir lenses composed of a - si posts on sapphire . </S>",
    "<S> these lenses are polarization insensitive and provide the high na required for collimation of mid - ir qcls . </S>",
    "<S> the flat form factor , low weight , freedom in the design of the lens phase profile , and potential for low cost wafer scale fabrication make these metasurface lenses attractive for incorporation in mid - ir devices and systems . </S>"
