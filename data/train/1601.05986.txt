    "in simple analytic terms the abundance ratio of a short - lived ( t@xmath17 100 myr ) radioactive to a stable isotope in the material that ended up in the solar system , just after a given nucleosynthetic event and assuming that both nuclides are only produced by this type of event , can be derived using the formula @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the production ratio of each single event , @xmath20 is the mean life ( = t@xmath21/ln 2 ) of the radionuclide , @xmath22 the timescale of the evolution of the galaxy up to the formation of the sun ( @xmath23 yr ) , and @xmath24 the recurrence time between each event .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is essentially a free parameter that may vary between 10 and 100 myr @xcite .",
    "the number k is also a free parameter that accounts for the effect of infall of low - metallicity gas , which dilutes the abundances , and the fact that a fraction of the abundances produced , particularly for stable isotopes , is locked inside stars @xcite .",
    "the value of k changes depending on whether the isotopes involved are of primary or secondary origin , i.e. , whether they are produced from the h and he abundances in the star or depend on the initial presence of cno elements , respectively .",
    "these effects are complex to evaluate analytically , but the general result is that k @xmath25 1 @xcite .",
    "et al_. @xcite did not consider the number k in their evaluation of ratios from eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] , which means that effectively they used k=1 and their reported timescales represent conservative lower limits .",
    "tr14 did not use eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] , but included the yields of @xmath0nb , @xmath26tc , @xmath27tc , and @xmath1sm ( and their reference isotopes @xmath0mo , @xmath27ru , and @xmath28sm ) from their snia models into full , self - consistent galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) simulations to evaluate the abundance ratios @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo , @xmath26tc/@xmath27ru , @xmath27tc/@xmath27ru , and @xmath1sm/@xmath28sm in the interstellar medium ( ism ) at the time of the birth of the sun , assuming that the production of @xmath2 nuclei only occurs in snia .",
    "these detailed models reproduce the abundances of the stable reference isotopes considered here @xcite . with eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] we can recover results close to those of the detailed gce models for the four ratios considered here using as @xmath19 the average of the values given in table  1 of tr14 = 0.01  0.02 , since we are focusing on events that occurred close in time to the formation of the sun . variations in this range of @xmath29 are within 25% .",
    "when considering also @xmath29 down to 0.003 they are within a factor of 2 .",
    "the only exception is @xmath27tc/@xmath27ru , which varies by 50% in the range @xmath29 = 0.01  0.02 and by a factor of 6 when also considering @xmath29 = 0.003 . ] , t = 9200 myr from tr14 , @xmath24 = 8 myr , and k@xmath30 ( table  [ tab : tab ] ) .",
    "this means that roughly ( 1/k)(t/@xmath31 600 snia @xmath2-process events contributed to the solar system abundances of the stable isotopes considered here . for the unstable isotopes , it depends on their mean life : because @xmath26tc and @xmath27tc have relatively short mean lives , the second term of the sum in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] representing the memory of all the events prior the last event counts for 26% of the total , hence , most of their ess abundances come from the last event . on the other hand , for @xmath0nb and @xmath1sm , due to their long half lives ,",
    "the second term of the sum is the most important .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath0nb it accounts for 85% of the total amount of @xmath0nb . in these cases the ratios from eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] are very close to the corresponding ism steady - state ratio , i.e. , the production ratio multiplied by k@xmath20/t .",
    "although we can recover the values of the ratios produced by the full gce models using eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] , we need to keep in mind some distinctions .",
    "the ratios derived by tr14 using the full gce model represent values at an absolute time 9200 myr from the birth of the galaxy , when the ism reaches solar metallicity . from these values",
    ", we can evaluate an isolation timescale ( t@xmath32 ) : the interval between the time when the material that ended up in the solar system became isolated from the ism and the time of the formation of the solar system .",
    "t@xmath32 is derived such that the ratio between the ess ratio and the ism ratio for a given radioactive and stable pair is simply given by @xmath33 . in reality , however , some mixing could have occurred .",
    "an ism mixing timescale ( t@xmath34 ) between different phases of the ism should be of the order of 10 - 100 myr .",
    "the effect of such process was analytically investigated by @xcite , from which @xcite derived that the ratio between the ess ratio and the ism ratio for a given radioactive and stable pair is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 t@xmath37 . in this picture ,",
    "the requirement is that the composition of the star - forming region where the sun was born must have been affected by mixing with the ism , hence , t@xmath34 represents a lower limit for t@xmath32 .    values derived using eq .",

    "t@xmath38 represents an upper limit of t@xmath32 and is derived such that the ratio between the ess ratio and the ism ratio for a given radioactive and stable pair is simply given by @xmath39 ( as for t@xmath32 ) .",
    "the more @xmath40 is lower than unity , the closer the ratio derived from eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] is to the ism ratio , and the closer t@xmath38 to t@xmath32 .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is that the k and the @xmath24 values in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] are uncertain .",
    "the advantages are that there are not further complications with regards to mixing in the ism and that this description is relatively free from uncertainties related to the setting of the time of the birth of the sun . in the model of tr14 , this is defined as the time when the galactic metallicity reaches the solar value . however , stellar ages and metallicities in the galaxy are not strictly correlated @xcite .",
    "chemodynamical gce models also including the effect of stellar migration @xcite are required to obtain the observed spread , but have not been applied to the evolution of radioactive nuclei yet .",
    "we expect these models to produce a range of abundances of the radioactive nuclei at any given metallicity , but we can not predict based on first principles if these variations will be significant . finally , it should be noted that , while t@xmath32 and t@xmath34 are required to be the same for all the different types of nucleosynthetic events that contributed to the solar system matter , t@xmath38 is in principle different for each type of event .",
    "we evaluate t@xmath32 and t@xmath34 assuming that the @xmath2-process radionuclides were produced by sneia and comparing the abundance ratios obtained by tr14 to those observed in the ess ( table  [ tab : tab ] ) . tr14",
    "carefully analysed the nuclear uncertainties that affect the production of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sm in sneia . in the production of @xmath0nb , ( @xmath12,n )",
    "reactions play the dominant role with some contribution from proton induced reactions .",
    "the nuclear uncertainties are related to the choice of the @xmath12-ray strength function and , to a lesser extent , the proton - nucleus optical potential .",
    "since the rates of some of the most important reactions are constrained experimentally , the nuclear uncertainties on the @xmath0nb production are moderate , resulting in possible variations in the ism ratio of less than a factor of two . the @xmath1sm/@xmath28sm ratio , on the other hand , is determined by ( @xmath12,n)/(@xmath12,@xmath4 ) branchings , mainly on @xmath41gd . the uncertainty range reported by tr14",
    "is based on three choices of the @xmath41gd(@xmath12,@xmath4)@xmath28sm rate . with respect to two previous estimates @xcite , the new rate of @xcite results in a @xmath1sm/@xmath28sm ratio higher by a factor of two in snia , but lower by at least a factor of two in ccsne @xcite .",
    "realistically , the @xmath1sm/@xmath28sm ratio may have an even higher nuclear uncertainty , possibly up to one order of magnitude , owing to the lack of experimental data at the relevant low energies for the @xmath41gd(@xmath12,@xmath4)@xmath28sm rate itself and for the low energy @xmath4-nucleus optical potential required for the extrapolation @xcite .",
    "for @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo , if we compare the maximum value allowed within nuclear uncertainties of 3.12 @xmath42 to the lower limit of the ess value , we derive a maximum t@xmath32 of 5.4 myr and a maximum t@xmath34 of 3.7 myr .",
    "it is also possible to recover a solution for @xmath1sm/@xmath28sm consistent with these values , given the large uncertainties .",
    "currently , the value of the half life of @xmath1sm is debated between the two values of 68 and 103 myr @xcite . here",
    ", we have used the lower value , if we used the higher value we would obtain longer timescales than those reported in table  [ tab : tab ] .",
    "we extend the study of tr14 to investigate if the origin of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sm is compatible with that of the radionuclide @xmath3mn .",
    "this nucleus provides us a strong constraint because near chandrasekhar - mass sneia are also the major producers of mn in the solar system @xcite and , together with the stable @xmath43mn , they produce @xmath3mn , whose solar abundance is well determined in the ess ( table  [ tab : tab ] ) .",
    "we calculate the ism @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn ratio from eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] using the same values for @xmath24 , k , and t derived above and the production ratio @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn=0.108 predicted by the same snia model used to derive the @xmath2-process abundances .",
    "this is derived from the @xmath3cr abundance given by @xcite , but , we note that different models produce very similar @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn ratios @xcite .",
    "we calculate an ism @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn ratio of 2.41 @xmath44 , which , after an isolation time of 5.4 myr , results in a ratio of 5.82 @xmath42 , one order of magnitude higher than the ess value .",
    "an isolation time of at least 19 myr is instead required to match the @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn constraint . if we make the conservative assumption that k=1 , instead of 2 , to calculate the ism @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn ratio from eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] we obtain t@xmath45 15 myr .",
    "this value is strongly incompatible with the upper limit of 5.4 myr required to match the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo , in other words , snia nucleosynthesis results in too high production of @xmath3mn relative to @xmath0nb , and to their ess abundances .",
    "a three times lower @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn ratio in snia would result from a tenfold increase of the @xmath46s(@xmath47)@xmath46p decay @xcite , in which case t@xmath32 would decrease to @xmath48 9 myr .",
    "this possibility needs to be further investigated .",
    "on the other hand , a possibly longer half life for @xmath3mn ( see discussion in @xcite ) would further increase the difference . to reconcile the ess @xmath0nb abundance with an isolation time of 15 myr",
    ", the half life of @xmath0nb should be almost a factor of three higher , which seems unrealistic .",
    "the current half life is the weighted average of two experiments that produced similar results in spite of being based on different normalizations : the first @xcite is normalized to the half life of @xmath49nb , which is not well known , and the second @xcite to an assumed value of the @xmath50nb(n,2n)@xmath0nb cross section .",
    "another option is that the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio in the ess is lower than 2.2 @xmath42 , i.e. , 21% lower than the current lower limit .",
    "it is harder to reconcile the different t@xmath34 : when using the lowest ( k=1 ) ism @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn ratio and the upper limit for the ess ratio , we obtain a lower limit for t@xmath34 of 24 myr . to reconcile the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio to this timescale an ess @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo=1.6@xmath42",
    "is required , 43% lower than the current lower limit .",
    "a different solution is to look into another production site for @xmath0nb .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath12-process in ccsn models do not efficiently produce @xmath2-process isotopes in the mo - ru region , but , other ccsn nucleosynthesis components may contribute to these isotopes .",
    "pignatari _ et al_. 2013 @xcite computed ccsn models with initial mass of 15 m@xmath51 that carry in the ejecta an @xmath4-rich freezeout component . there",
    ", production of the @xmath2-process nuclei up to @xmath0mo occurs due to a combination of @xmath4 , proton , and neutron captures and their inverse reactions during the ccsn explosion in the deepest part of the ejecta , where @xmath52he is the most abundant isotope . the stellar evolution before the ccsn explosion was calculated with the code genec @xcite and the explosion simulations were based on the prescriptions for shock velocity and fallback by @xcite .",
    "the standard initial shock velocity used beyond fallback is @xmath53 cm s@xmath54 for all the masses , and we also experimented by reducing it down to 200 times lower .",
    "results are presented for ccsn models computed with two setups for the convection - enhanced neutrino - driven explosion : fast - convection ( the rapid setup ) and delayed - convection ( the delay setup ) explosions @xcite . in this framework , nuclear uncertainties are insignificant compared to model uncertainties .",
    "a post - processing code was used to calculate the nucleosynthesis before and during the explosion @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized and compared to the snia models in figure  [ fig : ratios ] .    in comparison to the snia models ,",
    "the ccsn models produce less @xmath55mn , @xmath56fe , and @xmath57sm , and almost no @xmath27ru and @xmath58tc . on the other hand , no @xmath59fe",
    "is produced in sneia , and the cosmic origin of this isotope has to be ascribed to other types of supernovae , including ccsne .",
    "significant production of @xmath0nb and @xmath0mo occurs in ccsn models of 15 m@xmath51 , with production factors for @xmath0mo comparable to those of the snia models , and @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratios up to five times higher .",
    "ccsn models with initial mass larger than 15 m@xmath51 do not eject material exposed to the @xmath4-rich freezeout due to the more extended fallback . the @xmath4-rich freezeout efficiency",
    "also strongly depends on the shock velocity .",
    "when its standard value is reduced , even only by a factor of two , the amounts of @xmath0mo and @xmath0nb ejected become negligible .",
    "this is because for lower shock velocities the bulk of @xmath4-rich freezeout nucleosynthesis is shifted toward lighter elements closer to the fe group .",
    "only some @xmath12-process component is produced in these cases , which is poor in @xmath0mo . in summary , the @xmath4-rich freezeout conditions suitable to produce @xmath0mo and @xmath0nb are more likely hosted in ccsne with initial mass of 15 m@xmath51 or lower and shock velocities at least as large as those provided by @xcite .",
    "we explored the possibility that the @xmath0nb in the ess came from the @xmath4 freezeout production experienced by these 15 m@xmath51 ccsn models . since the premise of eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] is that both the stable and unstable isotopes present in the ess were produced only by this type of event , under such assumption , we can apply eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] only to calculate the @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratios to derive the time of the last such @xmath4 freezeout event , since the other isotopes are not produced in any significant abundancesnb . ] .",
    "the calculations are hampered by the error bars on the ess ratios and the large uncertainties related to the choice of the free parameters entering in eq .  [ eq : eq1 ] .",
    "however , to infer further information on the birth of the sun we are particularly interested in determining the lower limit of t@xmath38 because this provides us the shortest possible timescale , within all the uncertainties above , for the life of the star forming region where the sun was born . using k=1 in eq .",
    "[ eq : eq1 ] and the upper limit of the ess @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio we inferred a lower limit for t@xmath38 of 10 myr when using the delay setup ccsn model ( table  [ tab : tab2 ] )",
    ". however , we stress that k=1 represents a very conservative lower limit because the production factor @xmath0mo/@xmath0mo@xmath51 of the ccsn delay model is comparable to that of the snia model ( 140 versus 172 ) .",
    "this means that we would need a similar number of events ( which scales as 1/k@xmath24 ) to reproduce the @xmath0mo solar abundance - although the exact value would depend on the metallicity dependence of @xmath0mo/@xmath0mo@xmath51 in the ccsn models , which we did not explore .",
    "the lower limit of t@xmath38 from the rapid setup ccsn model is instead a negative value .",
    "however , the production factor @xmath0mo/@xmath0mo@xmath51 of the rapid model is five times higher than that of the delay model ( 704 versus 140 ) .",
    "this means that we would need five times less events to reach the same value of @xmath0mo in the solar system , hence , for consistency , a five times higher value of 1/k@xmath24 is more appropriate in this case .",
    "if we use , e.g. , @xmath24= 50 myr we obtain 7 myr as the convervative lower limit for t@xmath38 .",
    "our models show that @xmath1sm in the ess was produced by snia events , together with @xmath58tc .",
    "the large nuclear uncertainties on the former and the availability of upper limits only for the ess ratio for the latter two do not allow us to derive precise timescales . on the other hand , to reconcile the abundances of @xmath3mn and @xmath0nb in the ess as produced primarily by snia events , the ess @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio needs to be at least 50% lower than the current nominal value , which is outside its present error bars . in this case t@xmath32",
    "@xmath48 15 myr , which is consistent with the t@xmath38 derived for the last @xmath9 ( @xmath5 100 myr ) and @xmath11 ( @xmath5 20 myr ) process events @xcite since t@xmath38 represents an upper limit for t@xmath32 . furthermore",
    ", if all the @xmath3mn in the ess was produced by the same snia events that produced @xmath0nb , no ccsne exploding within the star - forming region where the sun was born should have contributed to the abundances of radioactive nuclei in the ess , since they would have contributed extra @xmath3mn .",
    "if correct , this will have important consequences for the origin of @xmath60al and @xmath59fe in the ess .",
    "the @xmath59fe/@xmath56fe is likely the result of the decay , after a certain isolation time , of the @xmath59fe abundance in the ism .",
    "this is consistent with the direct observational constraint from @xmath12-ray astronomy of @xmath59fe/@xmath56fe @xmath61 in the ism , and with timescales of the order of 15 myr , while @xmath60al may have originated from the winds of a massive star @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the @xmath0nb was instead predominantly produced by ccsne that experienced the @xmath4-rich freezeout , corresponding in our models to low initial stellar masses experiencing a core - collapse with high shock velocities . in the extreme scenario where all the @xmath0nb and @xmath0mo in the ess came from such events we have derived lower limits for the timing of the last of them .",
    "these are also still consistent with a relatively long t@xmath32 of at least 7 myr , since t@xmath32 @xmath5 t@xmath62 when @xmath63 , which is verified for @xmath0nb when @xmath24=10 myr .",
    "clearly , @xmath0nb could have been produced by both snia and ccsn events .",
    "full gce models are required , including both snia , the @xmath4-rich freezeout component of ccsn considered here , and the possible production in the neutrino winds .",
    "because the @xmath4-rich freezeout ccsne events of initial mass 15 m@xmath51 produce higher amounts of @xmath0nb than snia , we expect that adding them to the balance will increase the ism @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio at the time of the formation of the solar system , leading to longer t@xmath32 , and an easier match with the @xmath3mn/@xmath43mn constraint . in conclusion ,",
    "a higher - precision determination of the ess @xmath0nb/@xmath0mo ratio is urgently required .",
    "this will allow us to determine if snia are the major source of light @xmath2-process nuclei in the galaxy or if ccsne also play a role ; and which fraction of the @xmath3mn in the ess originated from snia .",

    "<S> here , we consider these results and combine them with new predictions of the production of @xmath2-process nuclei in @xmath4-rich freezeout conditions in ccsne to investigate the origin of @xmath0nb and @xmath1sm and to use it to further constrain the circumstances of the birth of the sun . </S>"
