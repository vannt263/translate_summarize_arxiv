    "ever since its inception @xcite transition state theory ( tst ) has provided a powerful conceptual framework for reaction rate theory . though originally devised to describe chemical reactions of small molecules ,",
    "it has been applied to a wide variety of activated processes , that proceed from suitably defined `` reactant '' to `` product '' states@xcite . in all these cases",
    ", tst identifies the rate limiting step of the reaction , and thus the reaction mechanism , and provides a simple approximation to the reaction rate .",
    "more precisely , tst applies to systems in which the rate limiting step is the crossing of an energetic barrier . in this situation",
    "the vast majority of reactive trajectories will pass very close to the top of the barrier .",
    "if a dividing surface ( ds ) between reactant and product regions of phase space is chosen close to the barrier top , the reaction rate can be computed from the steady - state flux of trajectories through this surface . to avoid overestimating the rate",
    ", one must ensure that trajectories are only included in the flux calculation if they are actually reactive .",
    "the identification of reactive trajectories requires , in principle , a study of the reaction dynamics in all its complexity . a simple method to perform this central task",
    "is therefore highly desirable .",
    "the crudest approach to identify reactive trajectories is to assume that every trajectory that crosses the ds from the reactant to the product side is reactive .",
    "this approximation , which leads to the standard tst  rate formula , is equivalent to the postulate that no trajectory can cross the ds more than once .",
    "depending on the choice of ds , the tst  approximation can be more or less accurate .",
    "however , for gas phase reactions and energies close to the reaction threshold , a ds can be constructed that is rigorously recrossing free and therefore tst renders exact rates @xcite .",
    "a recrossing free ds can not be found at higher energies @xcite or if the reactive system is strongly coupled to an environment , for example a liquid solvent . in the latter case , in particular , a typical trajectory will cross and recross any given ds many times , so that tst will grossly overestimate the reaction rate . for this reason ,",
    "much effort has been invested into the construction of a ds that minimizes recrossings ( see ref .   for a review ) .    since for reactions in solution the recrossing problem can not be overcome by a suitable choice of ds , other methods must be sought .",
    "a numerical simulation of trajectories does , of course , provide a reliable criterion , but it can be computationally very demanding .",
    "the simplicity of tst suggests that a more straightforward criterion might be available . for reactive systems coupled to a heat bath modeled by a langevin equation ( le ) ,",
    "we recently suggested such a criterion  @xcite : the trick is to shift focus away from the ds onto hypersurfaces in phase space that separate reactive from non - reactive trajectories .",
    "these surfaces , which are invariant manifolds , can be characterized dynamically from a more fundamental point of view , and this characterization allows one to compute them . in the present work",
    "we generalize the method of refs .   to a heat bath modeled by a generalized langevin equation ( gle ) , which takes the finite relaxation time of the bath into account .",
    "some of these results have already been reported in ref .  .",
    "we will here supply the missing details and extend the result to multidimensional systems .",
    "the usual le has been widely used to model the interaction of a reactive system with a surrounding heat bath.@xcite it neglects quantum effects such as barrier tunneling , which can be important in the case of light particles @xcite , and the interaction with electronic excited states through conical intersections @xcite .",
    "more importantly for our purposes , it also neglects the internal dynamics of the heat bath and assumes instead that the bath equilibrates infinitely fast .",
    "a more realistic model of a heat bath will take into account that the heat bath molecules need a finite time to move . as a consequence ,",
    "the stochastic forces that the bath exerts on the reactive system at different times must be correlated , and this correlation will decay on a time scale that is given by the dynamics of the bath .",
    "this effect can be described by a gle ( see refs .   and sect .",
    "[ sec : gle ] below ) .",
    "the original le as well as its generalization for correlated noise are equivalent to a hamiltonian model in which the reactive system is coupled to a bath of infinitely many harmonic oscillators.@xcite via this representation , the rate theory originally developed by kramers@xcite for white ( uncorrelated ) noise and by grote and hynes@xcite for colored ( correlated ) noise , can be obtained from a tst in an infinite - dimensional phase space.@xcite this approach could then be extended to include the corrections due to anharmonic barriers.@xcite in this work we avoid using an explicit model of the heat bath that introduces an infinite - dimensional phase space .",
    "instead , we work directly in the phase space of the gle , which is finite - dimensional for the friction kernels we consider .",
    "this choice is convenient both from a computational and from a conceptual points of view , since it allows to visualize the relevant phase space structures more easily .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed study of the phase space structures of the gle introduced in ref .",
    "that determine reactivity .",
    "this work is based on a recent series of papers @xcite that describe such structures and their use in rate theory , including the identification of reactive trajectories@xcite and rate calculation@xcite . with the exception of refs .   and",
    ", the previous papers were restricted to the le with white noise .",
    "they show that the le gives rise to a particular trajectory called the transition state ( ts ) trajectory that remains in the vicinity of the barrier top for all times , without ever descending into either well .",
    "it depends on the realization of the noise and takes over the role played by the saddle point in the tst of autonomous systems . for the case of a harmonic barrier , it was shown in refs .",
    "that the le becomes noiseless if the dynamics is studied in a time - dependent coordinate system with the ts  trajectory as the origin .",
    "it is then easy to identify a recrossing free ds in the moving coordinate system , as well as hypersurfaces that separate reactive from nonreactive trajectories .",
    "the most important of these surfaces is the stable manifold of the ts  trajectory .",
    "it contains all trajectories that asymptotically approach the ts  trajectory for long times .",
    "this stable manifold separates trajectories that descend into the product well in the distant future from those that descent into the reactant well .",
    "a knowledge of the stable manifold therefore allows one to distinguish reactive from nonreactive trajectories without any further computation .",
    "it solves the diagnostic problem that is fundamental to rate theory .",
    "the stable manifold will persist if the barrier is not harmonic .",
    "in refs .",
    "we demonstrated how it can be computed by perturbation theory .",
    "as already announced in ref .  , we will demonstrate here in detail that the stable manifold also exists in a reactive system described by a gle with correlated noise , and we will use it to derive anharmonic barrier corrections to the reaction rate for such systems . in the first part of the paper , in secs .",
    "[ sec : gle]-[sec : kappa ] , we consider one - dimensional systems . leading order rate corrections are derived for a generic one - dimensional barrier potential . for an application to a realistic system , i.e.  linc@xmath0licn isomerization ,",
    "see ref .  .",
    "in the second half of the paper , in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] , we extend the same computational method to multidimensional systems .",
    "we then derive the first and second order rate corrections for the anharmonic two - dimensional model potential that was already used in refs .  .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : rate ] we introduce the fundamentals of the rate theory that are necessary for our purposes .",

    "[ sec : kappa ] we explain how this critical velocity can be used for the calculation of the transmission factor . section  [ sec:2d ] is devoted to the generalization of the previous results to multidimensional systems , by describing the modifications of the method that are necessary to study a system of 2 dof .",
    "finally , we summarize in sect .  [",
    "sec : conclu ] the conclusions of our work .",
    "in this section , we summarize the fundamentals of reaction rate theory that will be used in the rest of the paper . for a more detailed discussion , see for example refs .  .",
    "as mentioned above , tst is based on the assumption that there is a recrossing free ds between reactants and products , that is crossed once and only once by every reactive trajectory .",
    "if we assume that this ds is placed at  @xmath1 and that the reactant and product regions are defined by  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 , respectively , the tst approximation to the reaction rate is given by the flux - over - population expression @xmath4 where  @xmath5 is the average population of the reactant region and  @xmath6 is the reactive flux out of it . in a system with @xmath7 dof",
    ", the ds @xmath8 can be parameterized by @xmath9 phase space coordinates : the velocity @xmath10 perpendicular to the surface and the coordinates @xmath11 and corresponding velocities @xmath12 in the transverse directions . the reactive flux is then given by @xmath13 where the average extends over all realizations @xmath14 of the noise and over a stationary - state ensemble of initial conditions ( ic s ) on the  ds .",
    "the characteristic function @xmath15 takes now a value equal to  1 if the trajectory given by the ic  @xmath16 is reactive if driven by the noise sequence @xmath14 and  0 otherwise .",
    "it ensures that a trajectory is only included in the reactive flux if it actually leads to a reaction , i.e. , if it descends from the barrier into the product region and thermalizes there . the main dynamical challenge in a rate calculation consists in the evaluation of the characteristic function @xmath15 . we will later propose a simple explicit expression for @xmath15 , in eq",
    ", that concentrates the potentially intricate dynamics of the system into a single function .",
    "standard tst sidesteps the dynamical problem by assuming that the ds is recrossing free .",
    "it then follows that a trajectory that crosses the ds with a positive velocity  @xmath10 will move from the reactant to the product side , contributing to the reactive flux , whereas a trajectory with a negative  @xmath10 will end in the reactant side and , as a consequence , will be nonreactive .",
    "in other words , tst assumes the characteristic function @xmath17 in the corresponding flux @xmath18 the average only needs to be extended over the velocity @xmath10 because the argument is independent of all other coordinates and of the noise .    the standard tst  approximation to the reaction rate @xmath19 always overestimates the true rate .",
    "the extent to which a given system violates the no - recrossing assumption is measured by the transmission factor @xmath20 unless the friction caused by the heat bath is very weak , the stationary - state distribution of ic s in the barrier is given by a boltzmann equilibrium distribution .",
    "this assumption will always be made in the rate calculations presented here , though the dynamical theory at the heart of this study does not require it .",
    "the exact expression   for the characteristic function applies to equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the average over ic s is then performed over an ensemble with probability density @xmath21 where  @xmath22 is the particle mass and @xmath23 is a boltzmann distribution @xmath24 for the transverse coordinates and velocities , being  @xmath25 the potential of mean force .",
    "the factor  @xmath26 in eq .   is the partition function that ensures @xmath27 under this assumption , the tst  flux   can be evaluated analytically to give @xmath28 the exact flux   is evaluated by randomly sampling ic s from the ensemble   and noise sequences .    to provide a benchmark for the perturbative calculations , classical trajectories",
    "are numerically propagated , using the algorithm described in refs .   until their energy is far enough below the saddle point , so that they can be considered thermalized . as will be demonstrated below",
    ", the selection of this cutoff energy is much more critical for the correct computation of reaction rates in presence of colored noise than for the case of environments characterized by white noise .",
    "actually , no matter how low the value of the cutoff is chosen , some trajectories will always recross the ds if one waits long enough .",
    "however , if the particle remains for long enough in the well into which it has descended , any further recrossing can be regarded as part of subsequent reaction events .",
    "the reduced dynamics of an @xmath7dof system coupled to an external heat bath that has memory effects can be accurately described by the gle @xmath29 where @xmath22 is the particle mass , @xmath30 is an @xmath7dimensional coordinates vector , @xmath31 is the friction kernel @xmath32 matrix , and @xmath33 is the fluctuating noise force exerted by the heat bath .",
    "moreover , @xmath31 and  @xmath34 are related to each other according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes an average over the different realizations  @xmath14 of the noise . in the first part of this paper",
    ", we will focus on the study of one - dimensional problems . in this case ,",
    "the coordinate vector  @xmath30 has a single component @xmath37 , and eq .   reduces to @xmath38 the potential energy",
    "can be expanded as a taylor series around its saddle point as @xmath39 where the formal perturbation parameter  @xmath40 measures the strength of the anharmonicity that comes into play as the particle moves away from the saddle point .",
    "it is only used to keep track of the expansion order and will be set equal to  1 at the end of the calculations . using this expansion , the mean force turns into @xmath41 with @xmath42 denoting the anharmonic terms .      in this work , we assume an exponential friction kernel @xmath43 with a characteristic correlation time  @xmath44 and a damping strength  @xmath45",
    ". it accurately describes the behavior of many realistic chemical reactions  @xcite . in this case , as for a variety of other friction kernels , the gle  , which is a complicated integro - differential equation , can be replaced by a system of differential equations on a finite dimensional extended phase space  @xcite with an auxiliary coordinate @xmath46 on the extended phase space , the gle with exponential friction can be represented by the system of differential equations @xmath47 now with a white noise source @xmath48 that satisfies the fluctuation  dissipation theorem @xmath49 in the definition of the auxiliary coordinate  , the choice of @xmath50 as the lower limit of integration represents the assumption that the system was prepared in the infinite past .",
    "this assumption is essential to guarantee that the phase space is indeed the three - dimensional space with coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , rather than a submanifold thereof  @xcite . in thermal equilibrium , the auxiliary coordinate follows a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath53 i.e. ,  it is not correlated with either position or velocity  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in the rate calculation , the average over ic s in eq .   must be supplemented by an average over the distribution of the auxiliary coordinate .      in the harmonic approximation and temporarily neglecting the noise ,",
    "the equations of motion ( eom )   can be rewritten as @xmath54 with the coefficient matrix @xmath55 and the phase space vector @xmath56 the eigenvalues @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the matrix  @xmath60 , obtained as the zeros of the characteristic polynomial @xmath61 are , in general , different .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are @xmath62 algebraic expressions for the eigenvalues could in principle be given , but they are unwieldy . more useful",
    "are the vieta relations obeyed by the eigenvalues    [ vieta ] @xmath63    they can be obtained by multiplying out the factorized form @xmath64 of the characteristic polynomial and then comparing coefficients . as @xmath65",
    "at least one of the eigenvalues , say @xmath57 , must be real and lie between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this eigenvalue describes an unstable direction in phase space .",
    "the two remaining eigenvalues , @xmath58 and  @xmath59 , must either be both real and negative , or form a complex conjugate pair with real negative parts since , according to the vieta relations  , @xmath68 in either case , a trajectory will approach the origin in the stable directions as @xmath69 , either in an oscillatory manner ( if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are complex ) , or monotonically ( otherwise ) .",
    "the boundary between these different types of behavior in parameter space is given by the condition @xmath70 . in this case , the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial @xmath71 must be zero .",

    "this plot captures the location of the manifolds at one instant of time . as the ts",
    "trajectory moves , the invariant manifolds will move with it . because the eigenvectors @xmath116 that determine the direction of the manifolds do not depend on time",
    ", this motion will be rigid , without rotation or distortion .",
    "if the barrier potential is not harmonic , i.e.  @xmath117 , the solution of the eom   becomes more complicated .",
    "however , general theorems on dynamical systems guarantee that the invariant manifolds persist in the presence of an anharmonic perturbation , as long as the perturbation is not too strong .",
    "they will , however , be distorted and will no longer be a straight line or a plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "moreover , the distortion is time - dependent , so that the motion of the manifolds is no longer rigid .",
    "nevertheless , the relative configuration of the manifolds will qualitatively remain as in the harmonic case , even though their precise location may be more difficult to determine .",
    "the critical problem in rate theory is the correct identification of reactive trajectories .",
    "a careful examination of fig .  [ fig:2 ] shows that a knowledge of the invariant manifolds solves this problem : all trajectories outside the stable manifold will leave for large times the barrier region in the direction of the unstable manifold .",
    "those that depart in the direction of positive @xmath113 , which by eq .   corresponds to @xmath118 and therefore to the product region , are reactive , while those that leave in the direction of negative @xmath113 are nonreactive .",
    "the boundary between these two classes of trajectories is the stable manifold , which contains all those trajectories that approach the ts  trajectory and never leave the barrier region .",
    "there is an important difference between this scenario and the situation in 1-dof systems under the influence of white noise : in the latter case , the stable and unstable manifolds are both one - dimensional curves in a two - dimensional phase space .",
    "each of them partitions the phase space into two regions , i.e. , trajectories will enter the reactant or product regions in the distant future depending on what side of the stable manifold they are on .",
    "similarly , the location of a trajectory relative to the unstable manifold determines whether it came from reactants or products in the remote past .",
    "the phase space is thus partitioned into four regions with qualitatively different behavior . under colored noise",
    "the stable manifold separates trajectories with different future behavior , as we have seen .",
    "the unstable manifold , by contrast , is only a curve in a three - dimensional phase space and is therefore not large enough to partition phase space into distinct regions .",
    "this complication , which occurs for white noise only in systems with several dof , is introduced by the presence of the auxiliary coordinate @xmath52 , that raises the dimension of phase space .",
    "now we come to an important point . in order to carry out a rate calculation , we do not need to classify arbitrary trajectories as reactive or nonreactive .",
    "the flux expression   contains only trajectories that start at the ds  @xmath119 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the stable manifold intersects the ds in the purple curve that can be regarded as the graph of a function @xmath115 .",
    "this function will be called the critical velocity . though this is not explicit in our notation , the critical velocity depends on the realization @xmath14 of the noise that determines the location of the stable manifold .",
    "trajectories that start with velocities greater than @xmath115 are reactive , while trajectories with lower initial velocities are not .",
    "this is indicated by the red and green trajectories in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , that start on the ds but on opposite sides of the stable manifold .",
    "the red trajectory begins with an initial velocity smaller than @xmath120 and it is therefore nonreactive , while the green trajectory is reactive because its initial velocity is sufficiently high .",
    "note that both trajectories recross the ds : the red trajectory starts with positive velocity and therefore leaves the ds towards the product region , but then turns around and leaves towards the reactant side .",
    "conversely , the green trajectory initially moves towards reactants , but ultimately moves off , towards the product side .",
    "this illustrates why traditional tst , using the criterion of eq .",
    ", fails in the classification of these two trajectories .",
    "because the critical velocity encodes all relevant information about reactivity , the characteristic function @xmath121 can be expressed in terms of it , as @xmath122 despite its simplicity , eq .",
    "is still exact , and if we carry out the average over initial velocities in the flux   we obtain the transmission factor @xmath123 which must still be averaged over both the noise and the initial value of  @xmath52 .",
    "equation   was originally derived to study the harmonic limit in ref .  , but it has also been successfully used in refs .   to study anharmonic systems by adequately modifying the harmonic approximation to the critical velocity . in the following section",
    ", we describe how this task can be performed for colored noise using a perturbative scheme .",
    "to calculate the critical velocity @xmath124 for a fixed value of @xmath52 in an anharmonic potential , the trajectory on the stable manifold that intersects the ds @xmath119 at the given value @xmath52 needs to be determined .",
    "if we take time  @xmath125 as the moment of intersection , we are looking for a trajectory with ic @xmath126 and a given value @xmath127 that is on the stable manifold .",
    "its initial velocity @xmath128 is then the critical velocity @xmath129 .    in terms of the diagonal coordinates  ,",
    "the constraints on the ic s read    [ critic ] @xmath130    where eq",
    ".   has been simplified with the help of eq .  .",
    "these conditions can be used to eliminate two of the three initial values @xmath131 . at this point",
    "it is convenient to express the initial values of the stable dof in terms of the unstable one as    [ critic_stab ] @xmath132    with these results , the critical velocity is obtained , after some tedious algebra , as @xmath133 in this expression the value @xmath127 is known , but @xmath134 is not .",
    "it is determined by imposing the condition that the trajectory lies on the stable manifold .",
    "in general , this requires a detailed analysis of the dynamics . in the case of a harmonic barrier , however , the stable manifold is simply given by @xmath111 , or @xmath135 , and then the critical velocity is @xmath136    for the anharmonic case , we use the perturbative expansion @xmath137 for the critical velocity , and similar expansions @xmath138 for the coordinates .",
    "the expansions are carried out under the assumption that the initial value @xmath127 of the auxiliary coordinate remains unchanged . substituting expansions   and   into eqns .   and  ,",

    "<S> the usual identification of reactive trajectories for the calculation of reaction rates requires very time - consuming simulations , particularly if the environment presents memory effects . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a new method that permits the identification of reactive trajectories in a system under the action of a stochastic colored driving . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on the perturbative computation of the invariant structures that act as separatrices for reactivity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using this perturbative scheme , we have obtained a formally exact expression for the reaction rate in multidimensional systems coupled to colored noisy environments . </S>"
