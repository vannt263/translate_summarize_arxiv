    "entanglement of formation ( @xmath0 ) and entanglement of distillation ( @xmath1 ) were invented by bennett et al in ref.@xcite and satellite papers . in a series of previous papers@xcite",
    ", we showed how to express @xmath0 in terms of conditional mutual information ( cmi ) , but we said nothing about @xmath1 . in this brief letter , we will show how to express @xmath1 in terms of cmi .",
    "recently , other researchers have expressed some of their entanglement ideas in terms of unconditional mutual information .",
    "see , for example , ref.@xcite .",
    "two reasons why cmi is useful for quantifying entanglement are the following .",
    "first , entanglement is an ",
    "exclusively quantum \" effect .",
    "cmi satisfies this requirement .",
    "it vanishes in the classical regime , but not in the quantum regime , for a fiducial experiment .",
    "second , entanglement is associated with a correlation between two events @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "but there must be something to distinguish entanglement correlations from classical correlations .",
    "cmi satisfies this requirement too .",
    "it measures more than just the correlation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "those two events are assumed to have a common ancestor event ( or cause , or antecedent ) in their past , call it @xmath4 , and we condition on that common ancestor .",
    "( see fig.[fig : ent - form ] ) for example , in bohm s version of the epr experiment , @xmath4 might correspond to the event of a spin - zero particle breaking up into two spin - half particles with opposite spins .",
    "we will try to make this paper as self contained as we can for such a short document .",
    "if the reader has any questions concerning notation or definitions , we refer him to ref.@xcite  a much longer , tutorial paper that uses the same notation as this paper .",
    "we will represent random variables by underlined letters .",
    "@xmath5 will be the set of all possible values that @xmath2 can assume , and @xmath6 will be the number of elements in @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath7 will represent the cartesian product of sets @xmath5 and @xmath8 . in the quantum case",
    ", @xmath9 will represent a hilbert space of dimension @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath10 will represent the tensor product of @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "red indices should be summed over ( e.g. @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath13 will denote the set of all probability distributions on @xmath5 , @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 will denote the set of all density matrices acting on @xmath9 .",
    "as usual@xcite , for any three random variables , @xmath17 , we define the _ mutual information_(mi ) by    h ( : ) = h ( ) + h ( ) - h ( , ) , and the _ conditional mutual information_(cmi ) by    h ( : | ) & = & h(| ) + h(| ) - h ( , | ) + & = & h ( ) -h ( , ) -h ( , ) + h ( , , ) .",
    "since @xmath18 , one might be tempted to assume that also @xmath19 , but this is not generally true .",
    "one can construct examples for which cmi is greater or smaller than mi , a fact well known since the early days of classical information theory@xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can define analogous quantities for quantum physics .",
    "suppose @xmath20 , with partial traces @xmath21 , etc .",
    "then we define    s ( : ) = s ( _ ) + s ( _ ) -s ( _ , ) , and    s(:| ) = s ( _ ) -s ( _ , ) -s ( _ , ) + s ( _ , , ) .",
    "before racing off at full speed , let s warm up with a brief review of the cmi definition of @xmath0 .",
    "consider the classical bayesian net shown in fig.[fig : ent - form ] .",
    "it represents a probability distribution of the form : p(a , b , ) = p(a| ) p(b | ) p ( ) .",
    "[ eq : prob - ent - form]one can easily check that for this probability distribution , @xmath22 is identically zero .    in the classical case , we define @xmath0 by e_f(p _ , ) = _ p _ , , k h ( : | ) , [ eq : clas - ent - form]where @xmath23 is the set of all probability distributions @xmath24 with a fixed marginal @xmath25 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is a function of @xmath25 . if @xmath23 contains a @xmath24 of the form given by eq.([eq : prob - ent - form ] ) , then @xmath26 .",
    "this is always true if @xmath23 is defined to contain all probability distributions with arbitrary positive values of @xmath27 .",
    "but it may not be true if @xmath23 contains only probability distributions with a fixed @xmath27 value .",
    "the fact that the right hand side of eq.([eq : clas - ent - form ] ) vanishes in the classical case ( if @xmath23 includes all @xmath27 values ) is an important motivation for defining @xmath0 this way .",
    "we want a measure of entanglement that is exclusively quantum .",
    "in the quantum case , suppose @xmath28 is a probability distribution for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath31 .",
    "for all @xmath32 , suppose @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",

    "one can show that eq.([eq : quan - ent - form ] ) with @xmath40 is identical ( up to a factor of 2 ) to the definition of @xmath0 originally given by bennett et al in ref.@xcite .",
    "other possible @xmath23 choices come to mind .",
    "for example , one could set @xmath23 equal to @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is that subset of @xmath42 which restricts @xmath35 to be of the form    _ , , = _",

    ", we will find a quantum counterpart for it .    consider the classical bayesian net of fig.[fig : ent - dist ] .",

    "events @xmath67 all occur before @xmath55 so they are independent of @xmath55 . therefore , we can write :    h ( ,  : , | ,  ) = h ( ,  : , | ,  , ) .",
