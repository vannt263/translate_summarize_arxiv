    "quantum general relativity has advanced over the last decade at a remarkable and accelerating pace .",
    "the introduction of ashtekar s new variables @xcite to replace the earlier metric representation soon afterwards led to the discovery of a formally exact physical state of the canonically quantized theory with non - vanishing cosmological constant , the chern - simons state @xcite .",
    "then the introduction of the loop representation @xcite permitted to reexpress the chern - simons state as a topological invariant of framed loops on 3-space @xcite , the kauffman bracket @xcite .",
    "it also led to the discovery of further physical states lacking , however , one important general property of the chern - simons state , namely a well - defined non - degenerate space - time in the classical limit .",
    "the chern - simons state semiclassically describes a desitter ( or anti - desitter ) space - time for positive ( negative ) cosmological constant , respectively @xcite .",
    "subsequent important advances were the introduction of spin - networks @xcite and quantum spin - networks @xcite as a discretized description of 3-space in which areas and volumes are quantized in planck units and which furnish yet another representation of physical states .",
    "the choice of different variables and representations has therefore played , and continues to play , a crucial role in the development of the theory .",
    "it is not always clear , however , to which extent the different representations are equivalent to each other .",
    "this question is particularly relevant for the connection between the metric representation and the representation in ashtekar variables .",
    "in fact it was shown in @xcite that the two representations are , in general , not equivalent .",
    "one may therefore wonder : has the chern - simons state , the only known physical state with a well - defined classical limit , a counterpart in the metric representation and is it unique ?",
    "in general , the answer to this question is still unknown .",
    "recently we examined this question for a spatially homogeneous mini - superspace model of bianchi type ix with diagonal metric tensor in the case of positive @xcite and negative @xcite cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "diagonal _ form of the metric tensor can be assumed in the _ classical _ theory without restriction of generality , because it is a permissible gauge - fixing condition for the remnant of the spatial diffeomorphism group in the bianchi type ix model .",
    "taking also the matrix of ashtekar variables as diagonal amounts in addition to a gauge - fixing of the lorentz gauge group .",
    "quantizing such a diagonal model therefore means to apply gauge - fixing of the diffeomorphism group and the lorentz group _ before _ quantization .",
    "the result of our study of the diagonal bianchi type ix model was that actually five distinct physical states in the metric representation are generated by transforming the chern - simons state from ashtekar variables to metric variables .",
    "this change of representation takes the form of a generalized multidimensional fourier transformation in the space spanned by the complex ashtekar variables along arbitrary paths or , more precisely , integration manifolds with boundaries pinned by the condition that partial integration without boundary terms must be allowed .    in the present work we take our investigation of this basic question",
    "a step further and examine the metric representations of the chern - simons state for the _ non - diagonal _ bianchi type ix model .",
    "why is this step interesting , and why ca nt the results of our study of the diagonal case not just be taken over ? quantizing the non - diagonal model amounts to interchanging the steps of gauge - fixing and quantizing : the gauge - fixing of the spatial diffeomorphism group and lorentz group is now done _",
    "after _ the quantization .",
    "the result is , in general , not the same as before the exchange of these steps .",
    "in fact , in section iii  a we give a very simple example from quantum mechanics which shows that gauge - fixing _ after _ quantization is preferable , in general , because it takes all symmetries into account in the quantization process in a natural manner .",
    "the example also makes clear that the result , in general , differs from that of _ first _ gauge - fixing _ then _ quantizing by ( i ) quantum corrections in the hamiltonian , ( ii ) weight - functions in the naturally defined scalar product and ( iii ) additional discrete symmetry requirements to be satisfied by the solutions .",
    "we shall see that all three differences also show up in our study of the non - diagonal bianchi type ix model .",
    "in fact the noncommutativity of gauge - fixing and quantization in the bianchi type ix model was previously discussed by major and smolin within the framework of path integral quantization @xcite .",
    "our investigation here differs by the use of canonical quantization and , in particular , by studying a special quantum state , the chern - simons state . comparing the two ways of quantization we find that on the leading semiclassical level the solutions for the non - diagonal model are the same as in the diagonal case .",
    "however , in the next to leading semiclassical order they already differ due to the quantum corrections in the hamiltonian and due to changes in the naturally defined scalar product .",
    "even more importantly , the additional discrete symmetry requirements are only met by two of the five linearly independent states , leaving just two physical states in the metric representation of the non - diagonal model which are generated by the chern - simons state , a generalized wormhole state and a hartle - hawking state @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that states of both kinds are related to the chern - simons state and that the two different semiclassical boundary conditions singling out either one of them can still be satisfied at this stage .    in a final step we also gauge - fix ( after quantization ) the time reparametrization invariance and",
    "introduce a manifestly positive scalar product on the space of physical states . as will be shown in a separate paper",
    "only the generalized wormhole state is normalizable in this scalar product .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define our notation and set up the metric representation of the constraint equations of the non - diagonal model ( ii  a ) , extract a well - known exact solution for @xmath1 , the wormhole state ( ii  b ) , and give the representation of the constraint equations in ashtekar variables ( ii  c ) . in section iii",
    "we discuss in detail the differences between the diagonal and the non - diagonal bianchi type ix model .",
    "we first give a simple quantum mechanical example , the harmonic oscillator in two dimensions with a rotational gauge symmetry ( iii  a ) .",
    "then the corresponding comparison for the bianchi type ix model is given ( iii  b ) .",
    "we also mention here briefly a gauge - fixing of the time reparametrization symmetry and an accompanying physical inner product on the space of physical states ( iii  c ) but a more detailed presentation of this point is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be given separately @xcite .",
    "in section iv the transformation of the chern - simons state of the non - diagonal bianchi type ix model from the ashtekar representation ( iv  a ) to the metric representation ( iv  b ) is given , leading to a general integral representation over a suitably chosen 3-dimensional manifold @xmath2 .",
    "in section v various asymptotic forms of this integral representation are evaluated .",
    "the limits considered are _ first",
    "_ @xmath3 ( v  a ) _ then _ either @xmath4 ( v  a1 ) or @xmath5 ( v  a2 ) , where @xmath6 is the geometrical mean of the scale parameters , and @xmath7 ( v  b ) without necessarily taking a second limit . in section",
    "vi we exhibit for the general case , i.e. without taking asymptotic limits , five possible and topologically distinct choices of the integration manifolds @xmath2 leading to five exact solutions of the constraint equations in the metric representation .",
    "we also discuss their relation with the asymptotic results of section v and their normalizability with respect to the inner product of section iii  c. our conclusions are then summarized in section vii .",
    "three appendices deal with certain technical details .",
    "the limit @xmath8 , the results of which are discussed in section v  b , is quite subtle and therefore done in some detail ( a ) .",
    "it leads to a nice integral representation of the vacuum ( i.e. @xmath1 ) solutions ( b ) .",
    "finally we check certain required nontrivial continuity and differentiability properties of the integrand of the integral representation of section iv  b on the integration manifolds @xmath2 ( c ) .",
    "in this section we shall set up our notation and give a brief derivation of the quantum einstein equations for the homogeneous bianchi ix model .",
    "while the classical constraint equations for this model are determined uniquely , the quantum operators associated with these constraints suffer from the well known ambiguity of the factor ordering , in particular in the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the main purpose of the following will be the motivation of a special choice of factor ordering .",
    "technical details of the derivation will be summarized rather briefly .",
    "let us start with the einstein hilbert action for a gravitational field with a cosmological constant @xmath0 :    @xmath9\\ = \\   \\int\\limits_{{\\cal m } } \\mbox{d } ^{4 } x \\sqrt{-g}\\ \\bigl(\\ ^{4}{\\cal r}-2 \\lambda \\bigr ) \\ ] ]     + here @xmath10 is the space - time manifold , @xmath11 @xmath12 the 4-metric on @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 the curvature scalar of the 4-metric .",

    "a stroke denotes covariant derivatives with respect to the 3-metric , @xmath26 is the curvature scalar of the spatial manifold and @xmath27 denotes the determinant of the 3-metric .",
    "let us now consider a _ homogeneous _ 3-manifold of one of the bianchi types ; then there exists an invariant basis of one - forms @xmath28@xmath29 , such that any homogeneous tensor field on the manifold has spatially constant components when expanded in this basis @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have    @xmath30     + with a constant structure matrix @xmath31 . in the following",
    "we shall be interested in the bianchi type ix case , where the structure matrix is of the simple form @xmath32 .",

    "in particular , if we are able to solve the more restrictive but simpler set of equations    @xmath111     + it is clear from the definitions given in ( [ 20.3 ] ) , ( [ 21.1 ] ) and ( [ 21.2 ] ) that we have also found a quantum state of the full , non - diagonal bianchi ix model with a non - vanishing cosmological constant in the metric representation . this will only be a special class of solutions , however , because ( [ 29 ] ) represents nine conditions , while the hamiltonian , diffeomorphism and gau constraints together constitute seven conditions only .",
    "we shall now adress the interesting question , wether the non - diagonal bianchi ix model presented in section ii and the diagonal bianchi ix model discussed in @xcite have the same physical content . on the classical level ,",
    "it is of course unnecessary to distinguish between these two models , because we can use the gauge freedom of the diffeomorphism constraints to transform the non - diagonal bianchi ix model to the diagonal one .",
    "when discussing the _ quantized _ bianchi ix model , most authors restricted themselves to the diagonal case , i.e. they solved for the diffeomorphism constraints on the classical level , and performed the canonical quantization procedure for the effective , 3 dimensional system .",
    "this approach immediately suggests itself , and one may hope that a quantization of the full bianchi ix model ( on a 6-dimensional configuration space ) with diffeomorphism constraints imposed on the quantum mechanical level should physically lead to the same results .    in the following , we shall first discuss a very simple example , which immediately shows that this believe is in general not true ; we will then show in subsection b that the two quantization procedures used for the diagonal and non - diagonal bianchi ix model indeed differ drastically .",

    "* the scalar products ( [ h4 ] ) and ( [ h9 ] ) contain different weight functions and different integration regimes .",

    "the chern - simons state , including its limit for vanishing cosmological constant , deserves a thorough study because it is undoubtedly the most important exact solution of all constraints of quantum general relativity found up until now .",
    "this is so because , unlike all other exact solutions , it describes a well - defined non - degenerate space - time in its classical limit and also because it makes an obvious connection between quantum general relativity and topological field theory @xcite .",
    "indeed it is remarkable that the general chern - simons state in ashtekar variables makes no reference to metric concepts on the space - like 3-manifold .",
    "it should be noted however , that writing down a physical state in ashtekar variables does not yet define it completely , because ` reality conditions ' must still be imposed before a physical interpretation can be attempted . imposing the reality conditions is a very nontrivial task and , as our results indicate , might not have a _",
    "unique _ solution .",
    "we circumvent this problem completely by transforming back to the real metric representation before applying a gauge - fixing and giving a physical interpretation .    the ashtekar variables and the densitized inverse triad form canonically conjugate pairs .",
    "hence , for our bianchi type ix model the generalized multidimensional fourier transformation we discussed in sections iv , v , vi can be used to transform the chern - simons state to the metric representation .",
    "this is a _",
    "generalized _ fourier transformation because neither the integration contours , which are here 9-dimensional manifolds , nor their boundaries are fixed a priori , except for the condition that partial integration with the chern - simons state under the integral must be permitted without contribution from the boundaries .",
    "the boundaries are therefore determined entirely by the _",
    "singularities _ of the chern - simons state . on the other hand ,",
    "for fixed boundaries the different integration manifolds one can find may be deformed without changing the result , or may be combined by first running through one integration manifold and then through other inequivalent ones , leading to linear combinations of the physical states defined by each integration manifold separately .    in eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) , with the five integration manifolds @xmath2 given by eqs .",
    "( [ 59.1 ] ) , ( [ 59.2 ] ) , ( [ 60 ] ) , ( [ a16.3 ] ) , ( [ a16.4 ] ) , we have obtained integral representations of five _ exact _ solutions to all constraints of quantum general relativity and we studied various limits of these solutions in section v. in the leading semiclassical order the result for the non - diagonal and the diagonal model is the same , as one would expect from the classical equivalence of both cases .",
    "however , differences appear already in the next to leading order , obtained in the semiclassical expansion of our results in section v  a. it should be noted that even studying the next to leading semiclassical order of a physical state in quantum general relativity is rather nontrivial .",
    "it requires to address operator ordering ambiguities in the hamiltonian , which we have done in section ii  a , to take proper account of quantum corrections in the hamiltonian implied by symmetries , which we have done in section iii  b , and to apply a complete set of gauge - fixing conditions including a fixing of the time reparametrization symmetry , which we have done in section iii  c. only then is the next to leading semiclassical order of a physical state unambiguously defined .    only two of the five solutions we constructed satisfy the complete permutation symmetry between the three main axes of the bianchi ix 3-geometry , which , as shown in section iii  b , is implied by the quantization of the _ non - diagonal _ model",
    "these are the states corresponding to the integration contours ( [ 59.1 ] ) and ( [ 59.2 ] ) .",
    "their semiclassical limits identify them as a wormhole state and a hartle - hawking ` no - boundary ' state , respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that the _ same _ chern - simons state in ashtekar variables can yield such diverse states depending on the choice of the integration manifold .",
    "this is a striking example that a physical state in ashtekar variables is not yet defined before further conditions ( here the choice of integration contours ) are specified .    in the hartle - hawking proposal for the semiclassical initial condition of the classical evolution of the universe it is not required that the ` no - boundary ' state is a normalizable vector in a hilbert space .",
    "rather the condition by which it is defined at least semiclassically is that the euclidean 4-geometries defined by the semiclassical wavefunction filling in the 3-geometries on a space - like slice are regular for @xmath290 .",
    "a further requirement for the hartle - hawking state is to give a well - defined probability distribution at the semiclassical caustic surface where the semiclassical evolution , given by the wave function , switches from a riemannian ( ` euclidean ' ) to a pseudo - riemannian ( ` lorentzian ' ) space - time .",
    "this requirement is met by the hartle - hawking ` no - boundary ' state obtained here , and only by this state among the five chern - simons - like solutions , as was shown already in @xcite .",
    "the wormhole state , on the other hand , one expects to be a normalizable vector in a hilbert space with a well - defined scalar product , in which other state vectors describe e.g. excited states of the wormhole . without going into details , which will be given elsewhere @xcite ,",
    "we have defined such a scalar product in section iii  c by gauge - fixing all gauge symmetries .",
    "it turns out that the wormhole state is , in fact , normalizable in this scalar product , while the ` no - boundary state ' is not . thus imposing either the ` no - boundary ' condition or normalizability in the hilbert space of physical states equipped with a fully gauge - fixed scalar product , one finds in each case a _",
    "unique _ but mathematically and physically vastly different state as a metric representation of the chern - simons state .",
    "one may hope that the non - diagonal quantization procedure presented here might be applicable even to the full inhomogeneous case , because all constraints are treated quantum mechanically in a similar way , and a solution to the quantum constraints is available in terms of the general chern - simons functional .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "support of this work by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through the sonderforschungsbereich `` unordnung und groe fluktuationen '' is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in the following we want to examine the possible limits @xmath7 of the chern - simons integral given in([39 ] ) .",
    "first of all , we shall briefly recover the wormhole state , which is approached for the choice @xmath305 given in ( [ 59.1 ] ) . using this integration manifold ,",
    "we may write    @xmath306     + where we made use of the spherical coordinates in the @xmath307-space , which were introduced in ( [ sc ] ) . easy estimates show that for @xmath7 just an infinitesimal region around @xmath308 contributes to the inner @xmath252-integral , so we have the following asymptotic behavior : is kept fixed , also @xmath309 , cf .",

    "@xmath310     + according to the transformation rule ( [ 26 ] ) we obviously approach the wormhole state @xmath239 in the limit @xmath7 , which was defined in ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "let us now turn to the much more complicated cases , for which the ` wormhole saddle point ' @xmath311 is _ not _ passed through by the integration surface @xmath312 .",
    "for such solutions , we shall try to set not all borders of @xmath2 at infinity ; instead we shall make use of the existence of two further singularities of the integrand with respect to @xmath252 , namely those at @xmath281 .",
    "if we integrate into these singularities in a suitable manner , we expect to create further solutions of our wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ 31.1 ] ) , because boundary terms generated by partial integrations will vanish at these borders . in the following",
    "it will be in fact sufficient to consider only one of the two singularities , say @xmath283 , since any @xmath252-integral in the neighbourhood of @xmath313 can be mapped onto a region around @xmath283 by a transform @xmath314 in the @xmath296-integral .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath296-,@xmath252-dependence of the integrand in ( [ 39 ] ) is given in terms of @xmath315 and @xmath316 only , cf . ( [ expo ] ) below .",
    "thus we will be interested in integration countours for the @xmath252-integral , which have one end point at @xmath278 .",
    "it turns out that , for a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 , there are only two curves of interest : firstly , we may perform our @xmath252-integral along the real axis from @xmath278 to @xmath317 ; secondly , we can also consider a pole integral , encircling the singularity at @xmath278 in the mathematically positive sense . to shorten our notation",
    ", we should establish the following nomenclature : a circle with radius @xmath279 , which is centered at @xmath318 and passed through in the mathematically positive sense will be denoted by @xmath319 .",

    ", we can uniformly estimate those parts of the integral ( [ a3 ] ) , which lie outside an @xmath326-neighbourhood of @xmath278 by a function , which vanishes exponentially for @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , just an @xmath326-neighbourhood of @xmath278 contributes to the integral ( [ a3 ] ) , where @xmath326 may be chosen arbitrarily small . as a consequence , all terms of the integrand , which remain regular at @xmath278 ,",
    "can be substituted by their value taken at @xmath278 , and only the @xmath252- dependence of singular parts remains to be taken into consideration .",

    "the first three integrals are tabulated in mathematical tables like @xcite , but the integral ( [ a9.4 ] ) seems to be a new result .",
    "thus we shall shortly comment on a proof of this formula , which , by the way , also holds for the other integrals ( [ a9.1 ] ) to ( [ a9.3 ] ) : the idea is to show that the integral on the left hand side solves the differential equation of the modified bessel functions with index zero with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath338 . after some partial integrations",
    "it turns out that this is indeed the case ; however , we thereby gather a boundary term , which exclusively vanishes for the boundaries chosen in ( [ a9.1 ] ) to ( [ a9.4 ] ) . for theses choices we then know that the integrals must be equal to a linear combination of the four possible products of @xmath342 and @xmath343 at argument @xmath6 and @xmath338 .",
    "the coefficients of these possible four contributions can then be determined by evaluating the integrals at @xmath344 , and , if necessary , by an additional investigation of the limits @xmath290 and @xmath345 .    with the integrals ( [ a9.1 ] ) to ( [ a9.4 ] ) we may now perform the @xmath286-integral in ( [ a6 ] ) and",

    "the reason for this is that , due to the complexification of the spherical coordinates ( [ sc ] ) , we might have integrated effectively over a three dimensional manifold @xmath2 , which produces boundary terms for partial integrations .",
    "for example , there is no reason , why a surface described by @xmath3511,+\\infty [ , \\,\\varphi\\ , \\epsilon\\ , i$]*r*@xmath352 - 1,+1[$ ] should lead to an integral solving ( [ a11 ] ) , although this integration contour leads to a finite integral .",
    "it will be a nice explicit check of solvability to investigate , for which choices of @xmath347 and @xmath348 and for which @xmath296-borders @xmath213 according to ( [ a10 ] ) becomes a solution to the three equations ( [ a11 ] ) :    while the operator @xmath353 annihilates the integrand of ( [ a10 ] ) for arbitrary values of @xmath296 , and therefore @xmath213 for arbitrary borders of the @xmath296-integral , we have to perform suitable partial integrations to show the vanishing of @xmath354 and @xmath355 .",
    "consequently , we get some boundary terms , which will not vanish for all possible forms of ( [ a10 ] ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of these boundary terms reveals that there are exactly four possiblities to arrive at solutions of ( [ a11 ] ) . for",

    "similar results hold for the other solutions , where one of the two bessel functions might be substituted by @xmath343 or @xmath363 . in such cases the vanishing of the boundary terms at @xmath285 becomes a nontrivial question , because the @xmath364- bessel function might become singular at these points .",
    "a detailed investigation shows that there are only the four possibiblities given in ( [ a12.1 ] ) and ( [ a12.2 ] ) to avoid contributions from these boundaries .",
    "the question which remains to be answered at this point is which integration contours for the @xmath286-integral give rise to the integrands in ( [ a12.1 ] ) and ( [ a12.2 ] ) .",
    "for the wavefunctions @xmath359 and @xmath303 the answer is easily found with help of the integral ( [ a9.2 ] ) , and we find the explicit representations :    @xmath365\\ \\ , \\ ] ]    @xmath366\\ \\ , \\ ] ]     + where the radius @xmath279 of the @xmath252-integral has to be chosen with @xmath367 .",
