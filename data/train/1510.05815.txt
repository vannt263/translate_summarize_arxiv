    "<S> this indicates that the bound state experiences a gauge field identical to a magnetic monopole at the center of the sphere , with the monopole charge equal to the quantized relative angular momentum of this bound state . we show that this emergent gauge field is due to the coupling between the center - of - mass and the relative motion on curved surfaces . </S>",

    "<S> this result establishes an intriguing connection between space curvature and gauge field , paves an alternative way to engineer topological state with space curvature , and may be observed in cold atom system .    </S>",
    "<S> emergent physics is one of the most important concept in the modern physics , and one of the most intriguing example is the emergent gauge field in the low - energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the original model does not contain a gauge field explicitly , but a gauge theory appears in the low - energy effective theory when tracing out some high - energy degree of freedoms . </S>",
    "<S> emergent gauge field has appeared , for instance , in the low - energy field theory description of strongly correlated materials such as doped mott insulators and spin liquids @xcite or dirac fermions in graphene under local distortions @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new scenario that when two particles form a chiral bound state on a two - dimensional curved surface , the center - of - mass motion of this pair , as the remaining low - energy degree of freedom , experiences a gauge field originated from the space curvature . </S>",
    "<S> this result brings about interesting connection between space curvature and gauge field in a simple system .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a system consisting two particles interacting via a short - range potential . </S>",
    "<S> such a problem can be treated by partial wave expansion , and generally the @xmath0-wave channel is the most dominating one for low - energy collisions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , when the potential is tuned to a @xmath1-wave or other high partial wave resonances , the interaction in this high partial wave channel can be very strong and a chiral bound state with non - zero relative angular momentum can form . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of two - body problem has been extensively studied in various circumstances in cold atom systems , such as in reduced dimensions @xcite , or in the presence of gauge field or spin - orbit coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that both the dimensionality and the gauge field can strongly affect the low - energy behavior of scattering phase shift and bound states . </S>",
    "<S> however , </S>",
    "<S> such a problem has not been considered in curved spaces and the effect of space curvature on bound state behavior has not been addressed before </S>",
    "<S> . this will be the main issue to address in this work . </S>",
    "<S> we should also stress that our results focus on the strong pairing regime , which is complementary to previous discussions of bcs superfluids @xcite or superfluid vortex on curved surfaces.@xcite     for two particles on a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> angle @xmath2(which is not shown on the plot ) is the angle between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( b ) : a schematic plot of coordinates @xmath5 for two particles on a general curved surface . here </S>",

    "<S> , width=326 ]    * emergent gauge filed in quantum - mechanical two - body problem on a sphere . * before considering a general situation of a curved surface , we illustrate the physics by solving a concrete model of two particles confined on a sphere ( with radius @xmath12 ) with short - range interaction ( with range denoted by @xmath13 ) . following the standard procedure of solving a two - body problem with short - range interaction </S>",
    "<S> , hereafter we first solve this non - interacting problem when the distance between two atoms are larger than @xmath13 and then fix the entire wave function by matching the short - range bethe - peierls boundary condition . in detail , it follows following steps :    _ 1 . defining coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> _ the two - body system can be described by the coordinates of two particles @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> for the convenience of separating the center - of - mass and the relative coordinates , we introduce another set of coordinates @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we define unit vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which represent the directions of the center of mass and the relative positions , respectively , and @xmath2 is the angle between the positions of two particles @xmath3 and @xmath4 . since @xmath17 and @xmath18 are orthogonal to each other , we can set a body - fixed frame @xmath21 where @xmath17 is the @xmath22 axis , @xmath18 is the @xmath23 axis and @xmath24 axis is determined by the right hand rule . the body - fixed frame @xmath21 is related to the space - fixed frame @xmath25 by a rotation matrix @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath26 , and the rotation matrix @xmath12 can be parameterized by three euler angles @xmath27 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig1](a ) shows the geometric meaning of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the center - of - mass point @xmath28 as the middle point of the geodesic ( the great circle ) , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the azimuthal and polar angles of point @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 is the rotational angle of the geodesic along @xmath30 , it specifies the orientation of the geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath2 represents the relative distance between the two atoms , and is proportional to the length of the geodesic . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the coordinates ( @xmath31 ) describe the center of mass position , while the coordinates @xmath32 describe the relative motion . _ </S>",
    "<S> 2 . expressing the kinetic energy operator in the new coordinates . _ </S>",
    "<S> the two - body system @xmath33 can be regarded as a single point moving on the product manifold @xmath34 equipped with metric @xmath35 . under the coordinates @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , the metric tensor becomes @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is listed in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> now the kinetic energy operator becomes ( we set @xmath39 ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the determinant of matrix @xmath38 , @xmath42 is the matrix inverse of the @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> after some straightforward simplification , we obtain @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the angular momentums along three body - fixed axis @xmath24,@xmath23 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that @xmath45 only depends on euler angles @xmath27 , and their explicit expressions are listed in the appendix . in the limit @xmath46 , @xmath47 becomes @xmath48 in this limit , the 2-body system is effectively living on the tangent plane of the sphere . by comparing @xmath47 with the kinetic energy operator on a flat 2d plane </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that @xmath2 corresponds to the relative distance between two particles , @xmath49 is the relative angular momentum @xmath50 ( therefore , hereafter we should use @xmath50 to denote quantum number of @xmath49 , ) and @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent the center of mass momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this also suggests that we can still apply the short - range boundary condition for a flat 2d plane to our problem .    </S>",
    "<S> _ 3 . </S>",
    "<S> eigen - wavefunction of the kinetic energy . _ to determine the eigenstates of the kinetic energy term , we expand the wave function in terms of wigner d - matrices , which are often used to solve the spectrum of a rigid rotor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner d - matrix @xmath53 is a common eigenstate of operators @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath49 with eigenvalues @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath50 , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . here @xmath58 represents the angular momentum along the space - fixed @xmath59 axis . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 has a simple form under basis @xmath60 because @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the lowering and raising operators of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are simple functions of @xmath2 ( see appendix for definitions ) . from the above equation </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that the first two terms are diagonal under basis @xmath66 , while @xmath67 can couple @xmath50 to @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if we consider a @xmath1-wave interaction , @xmath50 should take the value of @xmath69 at short distance and can be coupled to @xmath70 at long distance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the wave functoin can be written as @xmath71 here the superscript @xmath72 stands for two sets of solutions with different parity . here </S>",
    "<S> we note that the expansion only contains a finite number of terms since @xmath50 can not exceed the total angular momentum @xmath73 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ _ 4 . matching the short - range boundary condition and determining the wave function.__for @xmath1-wave interaction on a 2d plane , </S>",
    "<S> the boundary condition is @xmath74 where @xmath0 is the scattering area , @xmath13 is the effective range for the @xmath1-wave scattering , and @xmath75 is the energy for relative motion . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 can be tuned by a magnetic feshbach resonance in an ultracold atom system . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenenergy @xmath76 can then be calculated by expanding the wavefunctions eq.([ansatz2 ] ) in the short - range limit then comparing them with the the boundary condition eq.([boundary ] ) .     </S>",
    "<S> ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) and @xmath77 ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) for total angular momentum @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> solid blue lines are for a shallow bound state with @xmath79 , while solid red lines are for a deeply bound state with @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is the bound state wave function @xmath81 with @xmath82 for 2d plane with same short - range boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> this plot shows that for a deeply bound state , both @xmath83 and @xmath84 approach the same @xmath85 and @xmath77 vanish . </S>",
    "<S> , width=336 ]    in fig.[fig2 ] , we plot the wavefunctions for total angular momentum @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , it turns out that , for a @xmath1-wave deeply bound state , both @xmath86 approach the same wave function and @xmath87 vanish as @xmath88 where @xmath81 is the radial wavefunction of the same system with same interaction on a 2d plane . </S>",
    "<S> moreover @xmath89 becomes two nearly degenerate ground states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can define two new eigenstates as @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which become @xmath92 where we use @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it can be shown that for a deeply bound state formed in any @xmath50-partial wave channel , the wave function is given by @xmath94    this is a central result of this part . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in the limit of a deeply bound state , the center - of - mass and the relative motion become effectively decoupled and the wavefunction can be written as a product of the relative and the center - of - mass wavefunctions . </S>",
    "<S> the center - of - mass wave function is the most intriguing and suggestive part . </S>",
    "<S> it is represented by a wigner d - matrix . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , it is known that the wigner d - matrices are related to the monopole harmonics @xmath95 by a gauge transformation introduced by wu and yang@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are the eigenstates of a charged particle moving around a magnetic monopole . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there emerges a gauge field in our system which couples to the center - of - mass motion , and the charge of this monopole is the quantum number @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , it exists for @xmath1-wave or other higher partial wave bound states but not for @xmath0-wave . and for bound states with opposite angular momentum @xmath50 or @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> , they experience opposite monopole charge .    * emergent gauge field in the classical hamiltonian . * </S>",
    "<S> the quantum mechanical calculation has shown ambiguously the emergence of a gauge field coupled to a chiral bound state . to gain a more intuitive understanding of this result , </S>",
    "<S> we now show , with a classical hamiltonian of the same system , that this gauge field emerges from separating the center - of - mass and the relative degrees of freedom in the kinetic energy term . with this derivation , </S>",
    "<S> the geometric meaning of this gauge field also becomes clear and it can be generalized to arbitrary two - dimensional manifolds .    </S>",
    "<S> _ gauge field in the classical hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> _ the classical kinetic energy is given by @xmath97 , it can be separated into @xmath98 as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the moment of inertia along @xmath22 axis , @xmath101 is a 2 by 2 matrix whose elements are listed in the appendix . the angular velocity along @xmath22-axis is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> introducing the conjugate momenta as @xmath104 as @xmath105 the classical hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the inverse of @xmath101 , and @xmath108 represents the remaining potential and interaction terms .    </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian shows that the center - of - mass effectively moves on a deformed sphere with metric @xmath101 . while in the deeply bound limit , we find @xmath109 which is exactly the metric tensor of a sphere . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there emerges a vector potential @xmath110 corresponding to the coupling between the center - of - mass and the relative angular momentum @xmath111 . if we calculate the corresponding magnetic field of the vector potential @xmath110 , we obtain @xmath112 this is exactly the magnetic field of a dirac monopole at the center of this sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the relative angular momentum plays the role as monopole charge , which is quantized in a quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is consistent with the wave function of a pair found in the quantum theory .    </S>",
    "<S> _ physical meaning of the gauge transformation . </S>",
    "<S> _ it is natural to ask what is the meaning of gauge transformation . to answer this question , we recall that @xmath29 is the angle between the geodesic and the local base vector @xmath113 . thus the gauge transformation simply represents a local rotation of the base vector by @xmath114 , and the hamiltonian is invariant under following gauge transformation , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , where @xmath114 is an arbitrary function defined on the sphere . according to the definition of @xmath118 , we know that @xmath119 . if the center of mass is carried along any a close path @xmath28 on the sphere , the net change of @xmath29 should not depend on the gauge choice , and it is given by @xmath120 besides the regular @xmath121 term , the net change @xmath122 acquires an extra geometric term related to the vector potential @xmath110 , which only depends on the path @xmath28 and is an analog of the geometric phase introduced by berry @xcite . using stokes theorem we can write @xmath123 which is clearly gauge invariant </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the emergent gauge field is related to this geometric effect .     and the enclosed area @xmath124 . the normal direction around which two atoms rotate varies while the center - of - mass travles along path @xmath28.[fig3],width=172 ]    a more intuitive understanding of this gauge field is shown in fig.[fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> for a chiral bound state , two atoms rotate around the normal axis @xmath125 which is always perpendicular to the local surface . therefore , when the bound state travels along a closed loop one the surface , the direction of this normal axis varies , which gives rise to a geometric term identical to the solid angle expanded by the direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the berry phase effect of a spin varying on the bloch sphere .    </S>",
    "<S> _ generalization to arbitrary manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> _ this emergent gauge field can also be generalized to an arbitrary 2-dimensional manifold @xmath126 with metric @xmath127 for simplicity , we have chosen orthogonal coordinates @xmath128 such that @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the sphere case , we introduce coordinates @xmath5 as shown in fig.[fig1](b ) , where @xmath130 are the coordinates of the center of mass which is defined as the middle point of the geodesic connecting two particles , @xmath10 is the length of the geodesic , and @xmath29 is the angle between the geodesic and the tangent vector @xmath131 at point @xmath28 .    generally , it is difficult to write the metric tensor @xmath132 explicitly using coordinates @xmath5 . nevertheless , </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the two particles form a deeply bound state such that we are only interested in the regime where @xmath10 is much smaller than any other length scales , we can expand @xmath132 in small @xmath10 limit , and to the leading order , @xmath132 becomes @xmath133 here @xmath134 is the christoffel symbol of connection . </S>",
    "<S> given the expression of the metric tensor , and performing similar derivation above , we find that the kinetic energy can be expressed as @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> again , we obtain a vector potential @xmath138 and the corresponding magnetic field is given by @xmath139 here one can show that @xmath140 is exactly the gaussian curvature of @xmath126 , and @xmath141 is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the gauge field corresponds to a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface with the strength identical to the local gaussian curvature . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that the sphere case discussed above is a special example of this generalized result .    * concluding remarks . * first , if one creates a surface with periodic modulated curvature , it gives rise to a magnetic flux lattice to a chiral bound state and creates topological band structure . more interestingly , considering a bound state with either angular momentum @xmath50 or @xmath96 , </S>",
    "<S> it can be considered as a spin-@xmath142 particle , and since the emergent magnetic fields are opposite for opposite angular momentums , the time - reversal symmetry is recovered which can lead to a time - reversal invariant topological insulator . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that topological matter may also arise from nontrivial space curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , our results can also be directly tested in cold atom experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , considering a rydberg atom whose outermost shell electron is excited to a highly excited state with wave function @xmath143 , the interaction between other ground state atoms and the rydberg atom is proportional to the density of the excited electron @xmath144 @xcite , where the most attractive part is a thin shell of sphere centered at the position of the ion . </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed that a few atoms can be trapped by this potential shell @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these trapped atoms basically live on a two - dimensional sphere and interact via short - range potential , as our model requires . </S>",
    "<S> this will be an ideal system to test our results .    </S>",
