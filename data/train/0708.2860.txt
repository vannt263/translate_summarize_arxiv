    "density functional theory ( dft ) is a powerful technique originally developed for use in condensed matter physics @xcite that has been successfully adapted to nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "dft states that the ground - state expectation value of any observable is a _",
    "unique _ functional of the exact ground - state density ; moreover , if the expectation value of the hamiltonian is considered as a functional of the density , then the exact ground - state density can be determined by minimizing the energy functional @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dft allows one to replace the quantum many - body equations by a series of single - particle equations with local , classical fields that reproduce certain observables exactly ( energy , scalar and vector densities , and chemical potential ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the problem is reduced to determining the exact ground - state energy functional . however , this is impossible in practice . as a result , a number of approximate energy functionals have been developed ; one such theory is based on quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) .",
    "qhd is a low - energy theory of the strong interaction @xcite . here",
    "the hadron , and not the quark , is the observed degree of freedom ( due to confinement at this energy scale ) .",
    "qhd models the nuclear force as a exchange of mesons between nucleons .",
    "( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 ) mesons represent a medium - range attraction and a short - range repulsion respectively . the pion is also included to take chiral symmetry into account .",
    "dft allows one to replace the quantum meson fields with their classical equivalents ( kohn - sham potentials called mean fields ) ; these mean fields , while large , are small compared to the chiral symmetry breaking scale . as a result , one can use these ratios as small parameters with which to expand the energy functional in a controlled fashion .",
    "each term in this lagrangian is characterized by an undetermined coefficient which is assumed to be natural , or order unity @xcite .",
    "the resulting lagrangian @xcite has provided a method for predicting the properties of nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , the mean field theory of qhd is only an approximation to the exact energy functional .",
    "the question remains how this theory behaves when other many - body corrections are included to improve the energy functional ( such as loops , rings , clustering , etc . ) .",
    "this work is part of an investigation into the effects of loops on this particular energy functional and is a continuation of @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the many - body loop expansion was carried out to the two - loop order where , using the techniques of infrared regularization , all of the short - range , local dynamics were absorbed into the parameterization of the underlying effective lagrangian .",
    "what remained was the nonlocal exchange correlations , which were then explicitly calculated .",
    "in addition , the effect of this expansion on naturalness was investigated and the size of the two - loop exchange integrals was determined . since the interactions of qhd are relatively soft , one might expect that , once infrared regularization is taken into account , the loop expansion may be asymptotic .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to investigate the effect of the three - loop contributions on this theory .",
    "the loop expansion for qhd is constructed in the usual manner @xcite .",
    "the effective action is expanded around its classical value by grouping terms according to the number of quantum loops ( or powers of @xmath2 ) in their corresponding diagrams .",
    "for the purposes of this work , we are interested only in the terms in the expansion at the three - loop level .",
    "all of the integrals that represent tadpole and disconnected diagrams cancel out in the effective action and we are left with only the fully connected diagrams .",
    "in addition , those diagrams which are anomalous are discarded .",
    "for the cases considered here , there are eleven integrals of interest .",
    "ten of these integrals have four factors of the nucleon propagator and two meson propagators ( either scalar , vector , or pion ) each .",
    "there is one additional three - loop diagram with two factors of both the baryon and the pion propagator . in this work ,",
    "no nonlinearities in the isoscalar mesons were included in the effective lagrangian , as in @xcite . in @xcite , the effect of these nonlinearities",
    "was explored at the two - loop level . as we are interested only in the general effects of the loop expansion at third order ( and not an improved equation of state ) , these nonlinearities are not retained .",
    "the effect of the inclusion of nonlinear meson self - interactions on the three - loop integrals is left for future work .    why a loop expansion ?",
    "the loop expansion is a simple and well - developed expansion scheme in powers of @xmath2 that is derived from the path integral .",
    "the mean meson fields are included non - perturbatively and the correlations are included perturbatively .",
    "therefore , one can analyze the many - body effects order by order .",
    "the loop expansion has the advantage that it is fairly easy to separate the local and nonlocal dynamics and analyze their structures @xcite .",
    "consideration of the three - loop integrals will help us determine if this is a good expansion scheme or not for qhd .",
    "the diagrams at the three - loop level can be written as either ladders or crossed ladders ( with the exception of the one additional pion diagram ) .",
    "if one considers the bethe - saltpeter equation in the ladder approximation , one can replace the two nucleon propagators in the ladder with an approximate two - body propagator @xcite .",
    "this two - body propagator contains the nonlocal physics from the two one - body propagators and provides the proper cuts to maintain analyticity .",
    "it describes the propagation of two nucleons above the fermi surface . as there is some ambiguity in the definition of this propagator",
    ", we will consider three different versions : blankenbecler - sugar , thompson , and erkelenz - holinde @xcite .",
    "the remaining pion ( football ) diagram arises from the inclusion of a two - pion vertex .",
    "isospin and parity considerations restrict the two pion vertex to diagrams with the pions and nucleons only , at least at the three - loop level .",
    "because this vertex is antisymmetric , only a diagram that has two of these vertices will survive .",
    "fortunately , this diagram is analogous to the ladders and crossed ladders ; here we use a two - body pion propagator ( essentially the same as the baryon case but without the projection operators and theta functions ) @xcite .",
    "note that this two - pion exchange is not equivalent to scalar ( @xmath0 ) exchange ( which is an effective field representing any interaction in the isoscalar - scalar channel ) .",
    "any potential redundancy is eliminated by the parameterization .",
    "the remaining nucleon propagators can be separated into two components : feynman and density parts @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by taking into account the proper pole structure of the propagator .",
    "the feynman part describes the propagation of a baryon or an antibaryon ; the density portion describes on - shell propagation of a nucleon while taking the exclusion principle into account .",
    "thus , one can separate the local and nonlocal dynamics , as in @xcite ( see also infrared regularization discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "all of the vacuum loops are parameterized ; only the boson exchange between valence nucleons is calculated .",
    "it is also of interest to investigate how these loop integrals fit into the power counting scheme that was developed for the underlying qhd lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it was shown in previous work that the two - loop integrals are about third order in the power counting @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will determine the size of the three - loop integrals and how they relate to both the one- and two - loop levels .",
    "the tricky business of finding the appropriate expansion parameter is left for future work .",
    "the loop expansion has been studied in the context of other effective field theories , particularly chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "the techniques of infrared regularization were developed to separate out and absorb the local portions of the loop expansion in chpt @xcite .",
    "more recently , investigations have been conducted to determine the effect of multi - loop correlations in chpt and to discover the appropriate expansion parameter @xcite .    in this paper , the many - body loop expansion for qhd is investigated at the three - loop level .",
    "infrared regularization allows us to parameterize the local dynamics .",
    "the nonlocal exchange correlations are solved in the ladder approximation to the bethe - saltpeter equation for the lowest - order truncation in the underlying lagrangian .",
    "the effects of a high momentum cutoff are explored .",
    "the naturalness of the lowest level couplings is confirmed at the three - loop level .",
    "in addition , the size of the integrals is discussed and how they fit into the power counting scheme is investigated .",
    "in this section , we present the corrections to qhd arising from the three - loop contributions to the loop expansion .",
    "the background for the loop expansion in qhd is presented in previous works @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian used here follows from the _ chirally invariant _ lagrangian in @xcite , or @xmath3\\psi \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\partial_{\\mu}\\pi_{a}\\right)^{2 } - \\frac{1}{2}m_{\\pi}^{2}\\pi_{a}^{2 }   \\ , \\label{eqn : lagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 are the fermion fields and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the meson fields ( isoscalar - scalar , isoscalar - vector , and isovector - pseudoscalar , respectively ) .",

    "note that in this work , the conventions of @xcite are used . as in @xcite",
