    "recent experiments by ralph , black and tinkham , involving the observation of a spectroscopic gap indicative of pairing correlations in ultrasmall al grains @xcite , have inspired a number of theoretical @xcite-@xcite studies of how superconducting pairing correlations in such grains are affected by reducing the grains size , or equivalently by increasing its mean level spacing @xmath0 until it exceeds the bulk gap @xmath1 . in the earliest of these , a grand - canonical ( g.c . )",
    "bcs approach @xcite was applied to a reduced bcs hamiltonian for uniformly spaced , spin - degenerate levels ; it suggested that pairing correlations , as measured by the condensation energy @xmath2 , vanish abruptly once @xmath3 exceeds a critical level spacing @xmath4 that depends on the parity ( 0 or 1 ) of the number of electrons on the grain , being smaller for odd grains ( @xmath5 ) than even grains @xmath6 ) .",
    "a series of more sophisticated canonical approaches ( summarized in section  [ comparison ] below ) confirmed the parity dependence of pairing correlations , but established @xcite-@xcite that the abrupt vanishing of pairing correlations at @xmath4 is an artifact of g.c .",
    "treatments : pairing correlations do persist , in the form of so - called fluctuations , to arbitrarily large level spacings , and the crossover between the bulk superconducting ( sc ) regime @xmath7 and the fluctuation - dominated ( fd ) regime @xmath8 is completely smooth @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these two regimes are qualitatively very different @xcite : the condensation energy , e.g. , is an extensive function of volume in the former and almost intensive in the latter , and pairing correlations are quite strongly localized around the fermi energy @xmath9 , or more spread out in energy , respectively .    after the appearance of all these works , we became aware that the reduced bcs hamiltonian on which they are based actually has an exact solution .",
    "it was published by r. w. richardson in the context of nuclear physics ( where it is known as the `` picket - fence model '' ) , in a series of papers between 1963 and 1977 @xcite-@xcite which until very recently seem to have completely escaped the attention of the condensed matter community . in this work ,",
    "we ( i ) give a tutorial introduction ( with no pretense of rigor ) to his solution , and ( ii ) compare the results of various previously - used approximations against the benchmark set by the exact solution , in order to gauge their reliability for related problems for which no exact solutions exist @xcite .",
    "ultrasmall superconducting grains are commonly described @xcite-@xcite by a reduced bcs model , @xmath10 for a set @xmath11 of @xmath12 pairs of time - reversed states @xmath13 labeled by a discrete index @xmath14 , with energies @xmath15 and coupling @xmath16 , where @xmath3 is the mean level spacing and @xmath17 a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "unbeknownst to the authors that have studied this model recently , richardson had long ago solved it exactly , for an arbitrary set of levels @xmath15 ( degenerate levels are allowed , but are to be distinguished by distinct @xmath18-labels , i.e.  they have @xmath19 for @xmath20 ) .",
    "the first step is to note that _ singly - occupied _",
    "levels do not participate in the pairscattering described by @xmath21 , and by the pauli principle remain `` blocked '' @xcite to such pairscattering ; the labels of such levels are therefore good quantum numbers .",
    "a general eigenstate of @xmath21 thus has the form @xmath22 this describes @xmath23 electrons , @xmath24 of which sit in a set @xmath25 of singly - occupied , blocked levels , thereby contributing @xmath26 to the eigenenergy , while the remaining @xmath27 pairs of electrons , created by the pair operators @xmath28 , are distributed among the remaining set @xmath29 of @xmath30 _ unblocked _ levels , with wave function @xmath31 ( @xmath32 denotes a sum over all _ unblocked _ levels ) .",
    "the dynamics of these pairs is governed by @xmath33 and writing the eigenenergy of @xmath34 as @xmath35 , the state @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 diagonalizing @xmath38 would be trivial if the @xmath24 s were true bosons .",
    "however , they are not , and in the subspace spanned by the set @xmath39 of all non - singly - occupied levels , instead satisfy the `` hard - core boson '' relations , @xmath40 } = \\delta_{j j^{\\prime } } ( 1 - 2 b^\\dagger_j b_j ) , \\qquad   \\label{hard - core - boson-3 } \\mbox { [ } b^\\dagger_{j } b_{j } ,    b^\\dagger_{j ' } \\mbox { ] } & = & \\delta_{j j ' } b^\\dagger_j \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reflect the pauli principle for the fermions they are constructed from .",
    "in particular , @xmath41 implies that only those terms in ( [ eq : generaleigenstate-2 ] ) are non - zero for which the indices @xmath42 are all distinct .    in his original publications @xcite ,",
    "richardson derived a schrdinger for @xmath43 and showed that its exact solution was simply a generalization of the form that @xmath44 would have had if the @xmath24 s had been true ( not hard - core ) bosons . with the benefit of hindsight",
    ", we shall here follow an alternative , somewhat shorter root , also due to richardson@xcite : we first consider the related but much simpler case of _ true _ bosons and write down the generic form of its eigenstates ; we then clarify why this form fails to produce eigenstates of the _ hard - core _ boson hamiltonian ; and having identified the reason for the failure , we show that ( remarkably ) only a slight generalization is needed to repair it and to obtain the sought - after hard - core - boson eigenstates .",
    "let @xmath45 denote a set of true bosons ( i.e.@xmath46 = \\delta_{j j'}$ ] ) , governed by a hamiltonian @xmath47 of precisely the form ( [ 1 ] ) , with @xmath48 .",
    "this problem , being quadratic , can be solved straightforwardly by any number of methods .",
    "the solution is as follows : @xmath47 can be written as @xmath49 where the new bosons @xmath50 ( with normalization constants @xmath51 ) are given by @xmath52 and the boson eigenenergies @xmath53 are the roots of the eigenvalue equation @xmath54 this is an equation of order @xmath55 in @xmath53 .",
    "it thus has @xmath55 roots , so that the label @xmath56 runs from 1 to @xmath55 .",
    "as the coupling @xmath57 is turned to 0 , each @xmath58 smoothly evolves to one of the bare eigenenergies @xmath15 .",
    "a general @xmath27-boson eigenstate of @xmath47 and its eigenenergy @xmath59 thus have the form @xmath60 where the @xmath27 indices @xmath61 that characterize this state need not all be distinct , since the @xmath62 are true bosons .",
    "let us now return to the hard - core boson hamiltonian @xmath38 .",
    "its eigenstates will obviously _ not _ be identical to the true - boson eigenstates just discussed , since matters are changed considerably by the hard - core properties of @xmath63 . to find out exactly",
    "_ what _ changes they produce , it is very instructive to take an ansatz for @xmath64 similar to ( [ eq : truebosoneigenstates-1 ] ) ( but suppressing the normalization constants and taking all @xmath65 to be distinct ) , namely @xmath66 and to check explicitly whether or not it could be an eigenstate of @xmath38 , i.e.  to check under what conditions @xmath67 would equal zero , where @xmath68 . to this end , we commute @xmath38 to the right past all the @xmath69 operators in @xmath70 , using @xmath71 = \\sum_{\\nu = 1}^n \\left\\ {   \\left ( \\prod_{\\eta = 1}^{\\nu -1 } b_{j_\\eta}^\\dagger \\right ) [ h_u ,   b_{j_\\nu}^\\dagger ]   \\left ( \\prod_{\\mu = \\nu+1}^n b_{j_\\mu}^\\dagger \\right ) \\right\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to evaluate the commutators appearing here , we write @xmath38 as @xmath72 and use the following relations : @xmath73 =        { b_j^\\dagger \\over     2 \\varepsilon_j - e_j } \\ ; , \\qquad    [ b_0 , b^\\dagger_j ] = \\sum_j^u       { 1- 2 b_j^\\dagger b_j \\over     2 \\varepsilon_j - e_j } \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath74 =   e_j b_j^\\dagger \\ ; + \\ ;       b_0^\\dagger \\left [ 1 - g \\sum_j^u { 1 - 2 b_j^\\dagger b_j     \\over 2 \\varepsilon_j - e_j }     \\right ] \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inserting these into ( [ eq : commutehtofront-1 ] ) and using @xmath75 \\ ! b_0^\\dagger \\ !",

    "then the second line of ( [ eq : commutehtofront-2 ] ) would be absent ( because the @xmath78 terms in the second of eqs .",
    "( [ hard - core - boson-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : bjbj ] ) and in ( [ hubj ] ) would be absent ) ; and the first line of ( [ eq : commutehtofront-2 ] ) would imply that @xmath79 provided that the term in square brackets vanishes , which is nothing but the condition that the @xmath80 satisfy the the true - boson eigenvalue equation of ( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) !",
    "in other words , we have just verified explicitly that all true - boson states of the form ( [ eq : truebosoneigenstates-1 ] ) are indeed eigenstates of @xmath81 , provided that the @xmath80 satisfy ( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have identified the term in second line of ( [ eq : commutehtofront-2 ] ) as the extra complication that arises for hard - core bosons .",
    "fortunately , this extra complication is tractable : first , we note that @xmath82   =   \\sum_j^u {   2 g b_0^\\dagger     \\over 2 \\varepsilon_j - e_{j_\\nu } }    {   b_j^\\dagger \\over 2 \\varepsilon_j - e_{j_\\mu } } = 2   g b_0^\\dagger \\ , { b_{j_\\nu}^\\dagger - b_{j_\\mu}^\\dagger    \\over   e_{j_\\nu } -   e_{j_\\mu } }",

    "( [ eq : richardson - eigenvalues ] ) can be regarded as a generalization of the true - boson eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) , and was originally derived by richardson by solving the schrdinger equation for the wave - function @xmath44 of ( [ eq : generaleigenstate-2 ] ) .",
    "it is truly remarkable that the exact eigenstates of a complicated many - body problem can be constructed by such a simple generalization of the solution of a quadratic ( i.e.  non - interacting ) true - boson hamiltonian",
    "!    below we shall always assume the @xmath15 s to be all distinct .",
    "then there exists a simple relation between the bare pair energies @xmath91 and the solutions of ( [ eq : richardson - eigenvalues ] ) : as @xmath57 is reduced to 0 , it follows by inspection that each solution @xmath92 @xmath93 reduces smoothly to a certain set of @xmath27 bare pair energies , say @xmath94 .",
    "correspondingly , the state @xmath95 of ( [ eq : truebosoneigenstates ] ) reduces smoothly to the state @xmath96 ( up to a normalization factor not shown here ) .",
    "thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of all states @xmath97 and the set of all states @xmath98 .",
    "since the latter constitute a complete eigenbasis for the @xmath27-pair hilbert space defined on the set of unblocked levels @xmath39 , the former do too .      for a given set of blocked levels @xmath25 ,",
    "the lowest - lying of all states @xmath99 , say @xmath100 , is obtained by using that particular solution @xmath101 for which the total `` pair energy '' @xmath102 takes its lowest possible value ( as @xmath57 is increased , some of the @xmath58s become complex ; however , they always occur in complex conjugate pairs , so that @xmath77 remains real @xcite ) .",
    "the lowest - lying of all eigenstates with @xmath27 pairs and @xmath24 blocked levels , say @xmath103 with energy @xmath104 , is that @xmath105 for which the blocked levels in @xmath25 are all as close as possible to @xmath9 , the fermi energy of the uncorrelated @xmath106-electron fermi sea @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath108 for the ground state @xmath109 coincide at @xmath110 with the lowest @xmath27 energies @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , and smoothly evolve toward lower values as @xmath57 is turned on .",
    "this fact can be exploited during the numerical solution of ( [ eq : richardson - eigenvalues ] ) , which can be simplified by first making some algebraic transformations , discussed in detail in @xcite , that render the equations less singular .",
    "since the exact solution provides us with wave functions , it is in principle straightforward to calculate arbitrary correlation functions .",
    "some such correlators are discussed by richardson in @xcite , who showed that they can be expressed in terms of certain determinants that are most conveniently calculated numerically .",
    "moreover , it is natural to ask whether in the bulk limit , the standard bcs results can be extracted from the exact solution .",
    "indeed they can , as richardson showed in @xcite , by interpreting the problem of solving ( [ eq : richardson - eigenvalues ] ) for the @xmath108 as a problem in two - dimensional electrostatics .",
    "exploiting this analogy , he showed that in the bulk limit ( @xmath113 at at fixed @xmath114 ) , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : richardson - eigenvalues ] ) reduce to the well - known bcs gap equation and the bcs equation for the chemical potential , and the condensation energy @xmath115 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : condensation ] ) below ) to its bcs result , namely @xmath116 .",
    "we now apply the exact solution to check the quality of results previously obtained by various other methods .",
    "most previous works @xcite studied a half - filled band with fixed width @xmath117 of uniformly - spaced levels ( i.e.  @xmath118 ) , containing @xmath119 electrons . then the level spacing is @xmath120 and in the limit @xmath121 the bulk gap is @xmath122 .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath123 throughout this paper . to study the sc / fd crossover , two types of quantities were typically calculated as functions of increasing @xmath124 , which mimics decreasing grain size : the even and odd ( @xmath125 ) condensation energies @xmath126    and a parity parameter introduced by matveev and larkin ( ml ) @xcite to characterize the even - odd ground state energy difference , @xmath127/2 \\ , .\\ ] ] following the initial g.c .",
    "studies @xcite-@xcite , the first canonical study was that of mastellone , falci and fazio ( mff ) @xcite , who used lanczos exact diagonalization ( with @xmath128 ) and a scaling argument to probe the crossover regime .",
    "berger and halperin ( bh ) @xcite showed that essentially the same results could be achieved with @xmath129 by first reducing the bandwidth and renormalizing @xmath130 , thus significantly reducing the calculational effort involved . to access larger systems and fully recover the bulk limit , fixed-@xmath27 projected variational bcs wavefunctions ( pbcs ) were used in @xcite ( for @xmath131 ) ; significant improvements over the latter results , in particular in the crossover regime , were subsequently achieved in @xcite using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) ( with @xmath132 ) .",
    "finally , dukelsky and schuck @xcite showed that a self - consistent rpa approach , that in principle can be extended to finite temperatures , describes the f.d .",
    "regime rather well ( though not as well as the dmrg ) .    to check the quality of the above methods , we @xcite computed @xmath133 and @xmath134 using richardson s solution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exact - gse ] ) . the exact results ( a )",
    "quantitatively agree , for @xmath121 , with the leading @xmath116 behavior for @xmath135 obtained in the g.c .",
    "bcs approach @xcite , which in this sense is exact in the bulk limit , corrections being of order @xmath136 ; ( b ) confirm that a completely smooth @xcite crossover occurs around the scale @xmath137 at which the g.c .",
    "bcs approach breaks down ; ( c ) show that the pbcs crossover @xcite is qualitatively correct , but not quantitatively , being somewhat too abrupt ; ( d ) are reproduced remarkably well by the approaches of mff @xcite and bh @xcite ; ( e ) are fully reproduced by the dmrg of @xcite with a relative error of @xmath138 for @xmath132 ; our figures do nt show dmrg curves , since they are indistinghuishable from the exact ones and are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion we can draw from these comparisons is that the two approaches based on renormalization group ideas work very well : the dmrg is essentially exact for this model , but the band - width rescaling method of bh also gives remarkably ( though not quite as ) good results with rather less effort .",
    "in contrast , the pbcs approach is rather unreliable in the crossover region .",
    "the derivation of the exact solution shown above , which is shorter and perhaps somewhat more direct than the original published derivation , was invented by r. w. richardson too ; we thank him for a private communication suggesting this route .",
    "we also thank moshe schechter for helpful comments on the manuscript ."
