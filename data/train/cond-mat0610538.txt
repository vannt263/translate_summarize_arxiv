    "in the 20 years after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity the determination of the generic properties of these compounds has often been complicated by material and crystallographic issues .",
    "examples are the structural distortion in bi-2201 , bi - layer splitting of the electronic bands due to multiple copper - oxygen sheets per unit cell and the copper - oxygen chains present in ybco . in order to obtain information on the phenomenon of superconductivity in the high @xmath2 cuprates that is free from these complications one would like to study the simplest possible structure .",
    "the mercury based cuprates with their simple tetragonal structure and in particular hg-1201 , with only one copper - oxygen sheet per unit cell and the highest @xmath2 ( @xmath997 k ) of the single layer compounds , seem to be good candidates to achieve this goal . moreover the critical temperatures of these compounds are the highest obtained to date .",
    "there are however some indications for intrinsic disorder in these compounds@xcite .",
    "these systems have not been as extensively studied as other families because until recently sizeable single crystals were lacking . in an earlier publication @xcite the successful growth of large single crystals of optimally doped , single - layer hg-1201 has been reported .",
    "these crystals have subsequently been studied with resonant inelastic x - ray scattering@xcite and arpes@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present optical properties of one such a sample together with measurements of the specific heat .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sample ] some sample related issues are discussed ; section [ exp ] explains the experimental techniques used and in section [ res ] the results are presented and discussed .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section [ conc ] .",
    "large single crystals were grown using an encapsulation process as discussed elsewhere@xcite . the sample used for the in - plane measurements is oriented with its largest surface along the a - b plane with dimensions of @xmath10 mm@xmath11 .",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements give a critical temperature @xmath12 97 k with a somewhat broadened transition width of 5 k. the misorientation of crystallites is about 0.04@xmath13@xcite .",
    "hg-1201 is highly hygroscopic and does not cleave naturally along the ab - plane .",
    "therefore we polished the sample with a 0.1 @xmath14 m diamond abrasive in a pure nitrogen atmosphere before inserting it into the cryostat .",
    "in - plane normal incidence reflectivity measurements have been performed on a fourier transform spectrometer in the frequency range between 100 - 7000 @xmath15 ( 12 - 870 mev ) coating the sample _ in - situ _ with gold to obtain a reference .",
    "ellipsometric measurements were made on a woolam vase ellipsometer in the frequency range between 6000 and 30000 @xmath15 ( 0.75 - 3.72 ev ) which yield directly the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function @xmath16 .",
    "the spectra are taken with 2 k intervals between 20 k and 300 k. two home made cryostats are used that stabilize the sample position during thermal cycling .",
    "they operate at pressures in the order of @xmath17 mbar in the infrared region and @xmath18 mbar in the visible light region .",
    "figure [ rands]a shows the in - plane reflectivity r@xmath19(@xmath20 ) for selected temperatures .",
    "the reflectivity curves above 6000 @xmath15 have been calculated from the dielectric function . also shown is the reflectivity calculated from the pseudo dielectric function ( see below ) .",
    "+    in addition , the c - axis reflectivity r@xmath21(@xmath20 ) was measured on the ac - plane of a different sample from 30 to 20000 @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ caxis]a shows the c - axis reflectivity for selected temperatures .",
    "the c - axis optical conductivity is obtained from a kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformation and is shown in figure [ caxis]b .     +    in table [ dlparam ] the oscillator parameters for the 5 phonon lines are summarized . from a simple",
    "counting of atoms 8 phonon modes are expected of which only four should be infrared active . comparing with other cuprates we attribute the first two phonon lines to hg and ba vibrations , the mode at 355 @xmath15 to vibration of the in - plane oxygens and the highest mode at 622 @xmath15 with the vibration of the apical oxygen mode . the fact that this mode is split indicates that there is some oxygen disorder present .",
    "the additional weak structure seen between 200 @xmath15 and 300 @xmath15 is probably also due to disorder .",
    "below @xmath2 a josephson plasma edge appears that shifts with temperature to a maximum of around 70 @xmath15 for the lowest measured temperature of 10 k.    the ellipsometric measurements were performed with an angle of incidence of @xmath22 . due to the large angle of incidence",
    "the measured pseudo dielectric function has an admixture of the c - axis component .",
    "the c - axis dielectric function derived from the c - axis reflectivity measurements was used to obtain the true in - plane dielectric function @xmath23 , by an inversion of the fresnel equations .",
    "the uncorrected dielectric function at room temperature and corrected dielectric function for several temperatures are shown in figure [ epsilon ] .",
    "measurements were also performed for angles of incidence of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and no dependence of the corrected @xmath23 on the angle was found showing the consistency of this procedure .",
    "a disadvantage of using a cut and polished surface as compared to a naturally cleaved one is the possible occurrence of a misorientation of the crystal axes relative to the sample surface .",
    "this results in the appearance of c - axis spectral features in the in - plane reflectivity spectra@xcite . in figure",
    "[ caxis]a , r@xmath19 measured with unpolarized light is shown .",
    "a comparison with r@xmath21 suggests that these features correspond to c - axis phonons .",
    "also shown is a spectrum where a polarizer was oriented such that the spectral features observed in the first spectrum are minimized . using the model of ref [ ]",
    "the misorientation is estimated to be of the order of 3@xmath13 . in order to suppress the c - axis phonon features in r@xmath19(@xmath20 ) , light polarized along the intersection of sample surface and ab - plane",
    "is used for the in - plane measurements .",
    "the features are not completely suppressed however , likely due to the finite angle of incidence ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this shows up in the optical conductivity and the extended drude analysis below .",
    "another experimental issue is related to the absolute value of the in - plane reflectivity at low frequencies . in a metal for frequencies",
    "@xmath28 one can use the hagen - rubens approximation@xcite to describe the reflectance : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the dc conductivity .",
    "this is also expected to approximately hold for cuprates in the normal state and this approximation is frequently used to perform kk transformations of reflectivity spectra . in figure [ extrap ]",
    "the in - plane reflectivity plotted versus @xmath31 is shown for four different temperatures in the normal state .",
    "the extrapolations have been obtained by fitting eq .",
    "[ hr ] to the spectra between 100 @xmath15 and 300 @xmath15 .",
    "one can see that the reflectivity extrapolates to @xmath9 0.97 instead of 1 for @xmath32 . since the curves all extrapolate to approximately the same value the difference is presumably due to the presence of a non - conducting secondary phase . from the fits we extracted the dc conductivity and compared the temperature dependence to resistivity measurements@xcite .",
    "these two measurements correspond in absolute value and follow the same temperature dependence .",
    "however a problem arises when we try to model r@xmath19 with a drude - lorentz model . for temperatures below @xmath2",
    "the fits show no sign of superconductivity . instead of a delta function or very narrow drude like contribution we find a rather broad drude peak .",
    "moreover the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity obtained from the model does not correspond with the resistivity measurements .",
    "we find that if we scale the in - plane reflectivity measurements upwards by 3@xmath33 for all temperatures the dc conductivity extracted from the model closely follows the dc resistivity measurements and the drude peak below @xmath2 is replaced by a delta function .    to extract the optical conductivity from the measured in - plane reflectivity and dielectric function a kk constrained variational analysis is used@xcite .",
    "first , r@xmath19(@xmath20 ) and @xmath23 are fitted simultaneously to a standard drude - lorentz model of which the parameters are given in table [ dlparam ] for the room temperature spectra .",
    "note that the last oscillator falls outside the measured spectral range .",
    ".left : oscillator parameters of the in - plane room temperature drude - lorentz model in ev ( except @xmath34 which is dimensionless ) .",
    "right : c - axis phonon parameters in @xmath15 [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in a second step this model is then refined using multi - oscillator variational dielectric functions that fit all spectral details of r@xmath19(@xmath20 ) and @xmath23 .",
    "this approach improves the determination of the high frequency optical conductivity because the measured dielectric function in the visible light region is used to anchor the unknown phase of the reflectivity .",
    "the in - plane reflectivity measurements have been scaled upwards by 3@xmath33 as explained above .    in figure [ rands]b the optical conductivity",
    "is shown for selected temperatures .",
    "it displays many of the features common to cuprates . at room temperature",
    "the low frequency spectrum is dominated by a drude like peak that narrows when temperature is decreased .",
    "below @xmath2 a partial gap opens up followed by an onset in absorption that starts around 500 - 600 @xmath15 .",
    "this value for the onset is comparable to optimally doped bi-2212 , ybco and tl-2201@xcite which all have approximately the same critical temperature but very different crystal structures indicating that this onset originates in the cuo@xmath0 planes . above 0.5 ev",
    "the optical conductivity is only weakly temperature dependent .",
    "we find evidence for at least three interband transitions with resonance energies of 1.41 ev , 2.51 ev and 3.36 ev .",
    "the latter two transitions have resonance energies close to resonances observed in the rixs study of ref [ ] .",
    "unfortunately , the c - axis contamination of the in - plane spectra prevents us from making rigorous statements about any in - plane phonon features .",
    "specific - heat measurements have been performed in magnetic fields up to 14 t on a small piece broken from the crystal used for the optical measurements with a mass of @xmath35700 @xmath14 g .",
    "the magnetic fields used in these measurements are oriented perpendicular to the cu - o planes .",
    "since the specific heat is a probe of bulk thermodynamic properties the measurements confirm the bulk nature of the superconducting transition .",
    "it also gives an estimate of the strength of thermal fluctuations and of the superconducting condensation energy .",
    "a micro - relaxation calorimeter adapted to the small size of the crystal was used .",
    "data has been taken using a generalized long relaxation method as described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "this method gives a high precision in the determination of absolute values and a sensitivity comparable to that of standard ac methods as used in previous publications on hg-1201@xcite .",
    "the absolute error is estimated as  5 % due to the mass of the thermal compound used to mount the small sample .",
    "this does not enter into relative measurements when data taken in a magnetic field is used as a background .    in figure",
    "[ specheat]a we show two representative specific heat curves measured in fields of 0 t and 14 t.    figure [ specheat]b shows the difference @xmath36 between measurements taken in a field @xmath37 and that taken in a field of 14 t in @xmath38 . due to the much higher upper critical field ,",
    "subtracting data taken in a 14 t field does not provide the exact compensation of the phonon background but helps to investigate the shape and size of the anomaly .",
    "note that the anomaly is only 0.4 @xmath33 of the total specific heat and thus particularly small as compared to other cuprate superconductors .",
    "the original drude theory of non - interacting electrons assumes a frequency independent scattering rate @xmath39 .",
    "this assumption does not hold in systems where the charge carriers interact with a bosonic spectrum or where strong correlations are important .",
    "this theory was extended by allen and mikkelsen to include a frequency dependent scattering rate @xmath40 in which the optical conductivity takes the form@xcite , @xmath41 with @xmath42 the bare plasma frequency of the free charge carriers , @xmath43 the effective mass and @xmath44 the band mass .",
    "note that since @xmath45 is causal , @xmath46 and @xmath47 obey kk relations .",
    "although @xmath46 and @xmath47 are simply related to the real and imaginary parts of 1/@xmath48 , there is a subtlety that one has to consider to reliably extract these two quantities from the data .",
    "this is best illustrated by expressing @xmath46 and @xmath47 in terms of the dielectric function @xmath49 : @xmath50^{2}+\\epsilon_{2}^{2}(\\omega)}\\ ] ] and @xmath51^{2}+\\epsilon_{2}^{2}(\\omega)}.\\ ] ] here @xmath52 is the contribution to the dielectric function in the infrared arising from interband transitions which should not be taken into account in the single component approach .",
    "the subtlety is in the choice of @xmath52 and @xmath42 .",
    "the choice of @xmath52 is not so important at low energies where @xmath53 but becomes important at higher energies .",
    "for example , early studies of the cuprates indicated that the scattering rate was linear in frequency up to energies as high as 1 ev@xcite , but if @xmath52 is chosen as below the scattering rate starts to show signs of saturation already around 0.5 ev@xcite . here",
    "the following convention is adopted : @xmath54 where the @xmath55 are the oscillator strengths of the interband transitions obtained from a drude - lorentz fit ( see table [ dlparam ] ) and @xmath42 is chosen such that @xmath47 approaches unity at high energy ( @xmath351 ev ) .",
    "this leads to the choice @xmath56 and @xmath5716500 @xmath15 in the present case .",
    "the value of @xmath52 is slightly smaller than the ones found in ref [ ] for bi-2212 , likely due to the smaller volume fraction of oxygens in the unit cell .",
    "the contribution to the dielectric function from the polarizability of oxygen is easily calculated using the clausius - mossotti relation , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of oxygens per unit cell , v is the unit cell volume and @xmath60 is the polarizability of the oxygen atoms . in the second equality",
    "we have defined @xmath61 .",
    "the factor @xmath62 appearing in the denominator is a geometrical factor for a cubic crystal structure which we keep for simplicity . for o@xmath63 the ionic polarizability @xmath643.88@xmath6510@xmath66 cm@xmath11 .",
    "using unit cell parameters for hg-1201 of @xmath68 = 3.85 @xmath69 3.85 @xmath69 9.5 @xmath70 and 4 oxygen atoms per unit cell we find @xmath71 , which is fortuitously close to our estimate of 3.6 in view of the lesser agreement for bi-2212 and bi-2223 as we now show . for optimally doped bi-2212 and optimally",
    "doped bi-2223 we use @xmath72 = 5.4 @xmath69 5.4 @xmath69 30.8 @xmath70 and @xmath72 = 5.4 @xmath69 5.4 @xmath69 37.1 @xmath70 respectively .",
    "these are the cell parameters corresponding to 4 formula units , i.e. @xmath73 and @xmath74 oxygens respectively .",
    "this yields @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these values are substantially larger than the estimated experimental values @xmath77 for bi-2212@xcite and @xmath78 for bi-2223 .",
    "figure [ taumstar ] shows @xmath40 and @xmath79 for selected temperatures .",
    "the scattering rate is strongly suppressed below 600 @xmath15 for temperatures below @xmath2 indicative of the opening of a gap .",
    "arpes measurements on hg-1201 show a maximum gap value of 30 mev , but there is some uncertainty in this value because no quasiparticle peak is observed around the anti - nodal direction@xcite . from the optical measurements it is difficult to extract the gap value : simple s - wave bcs superconductors in the dirty limit",
    "show an onset in absorption associated with the superconducting gap at 2@xmath80 .",
    "this onset is shifted to @xmath81 , with @xmath82 a phonon resonance energy , if the coupling to phonons is included .",
    "it has been suggested that the onset seen in cuprates is shifted due to the interaction of the electrons with the magnetic resonance mode@xcite by @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "the onset here is defined as the point where the rise in @xmath40 is steepest .",
    "this corresponds by kk relations to a maximum in @xmath79 . using the values @xmath85 mev@xcite and @xmath86 mev@xcite we find @xmath87 mev ( @xmath88 @xmath15 ) , which is of the same order of magnitude as our experimental value of @xmath89 mev .    in figure [ extdrudetdep ]",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is shown for selected photon energies . in the normal state ,",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath46 for small photon energies is linear in temperature but this linearity is lost for photon energies larger than @xmath90 ev .",
    "the scattering rate shows a sharp drop at @xmath2 for all photon energies except in a narrow window between 95 and 140 mev where the scattering rate increases below @xmath2 .",
    "it has a maximum increase around 110 mev .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath47 becomes roughly linear above @xmath90 ev and shows an increase when the system becomes superconducting over most of the frequency range , except below 55 mev where it decreases .",
    "the in - plane condensate strength @xmath91 is determined in two ways .",
    "the first method is to fit the low temperature spectrum with a drude - lorentz model .",
    "in such a model the superfluid density is represented by a @xmath92-peak at zero frequency with strength @xmath93 .",
    "the value obtained from this method is @xmath94 = 9600 @xmath95 400 @xmath15 ( @xmath96 ev ) .",
    "the error bar on this quantity is determined by shifting the reflectivity up and down by 1 @xmath33 and observing the subsequent change in @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding values for bi-2212 and bi-2223 are @xmath94 = 9500 @xmath15 and @xmath94 = 10300 @xmath15 respectively@xcite .",
    "the second method relies on the assumption that the real part of the dielectric function in the superconducting state is dominated at low frequencies by the superfluid density , @xmath97 since @xmath98 has been determined in a model independent way this result is more reliable . in figure [ wsqeps ]",
    "the function @xmath99 is shown .",
    "the extrapolation to zero frequency of this function matches well with the value obtained with the drude - lorentz fit .",
    "it is interesting to use the value for @xmath94 extracted from the in - plane measurements and from c - axis measurements to check the scaling relation @xmath3@xcite .",
    "this has already been done for the c - axis measurements in ref . [ . from a drude - lorentz fit to the c - axis data a value of @xmath100 @xmath101 is found , more than a factor of 30 different from the in - plane value . at the same time from an extrapolation @xmath32 we find @xmath102 7 @xmath103@xmath15 for the c - axis and @xmath1048300 @xmath103@xmath15 .",
    "put together we find @xmath105 and @xmath106 in good agreement with the scaling trend observed in ref [ ] .      in recent years",
    "there has been a lot of interest in the temperature dependence of the low frequency integrated spectral weight , @xmath107 where _ a _ is the in - plane lattice constant , _",
    "v _ the unit cell volume and @xmath108 the kinetic energy operator .",
    "@xmath109 is a cut off frequency chosen to approximately separate the intraband and interband transitions . in a nearest neighbor tight binding model the relation between w(@xmath109,t ) and",
    "@xmath110 is exact .",
    "more recently it has been shown that this relation still holds approximately in the doping range under consideration@xcite . according to bcs theory the kinetic energy increases when the system is driven into the superconducting state but it theoretically @xcite and experimentally@xcite it was found that in cuprates the kinetic energy decreases over a large doping range .",
    "recently , in studies of the doping dependence of bi-2212 it was found that on the overdoped side of the phase diagram the kinetic energy follows the bcs prediction@xcite .",

    "i.e _ the frequency for which @xmath113 , with temperature .",

    "the integration one has to rely on an extrapolation of the reflectivity to zero frequency .",
    "it has recently been shown that the superconductivity induced increase of spectral weight and absolute value of @xmath111 are rather insensitive to this extrapolation , provided one also uses the information contained in @xmath118@xcite .",

    "[ sweq ] with the cut off @xmath109 = 1 ev .",
    "one would like to choose @xmath109 such that it separates the free carrier response from the bound charge response .",
    "this is strictly speaking not possible because in most cuprates the two regions overlap .",
    "therefore the cut off is chosen in a region where the superconductivity induced change of spectral weight is more or less constant ( figure [ slopeanalysis]c ) . by extrapolating the normal state trend to @xmath119 , the superconductivity induced increase of spectral weight is estimated to be @xmath120 @xmath103 @xmath101 which is 0.5 @xmath33 of the total spectral weight .",
    "a remark has to be made here on the temperature dependence of @xmath111 .",
    "the temperature dependent reflectivity measurements show a hysteresis between curves measured cooling down and curves measured warming up for frequencies between 3000 @xmath15 and 7000 @xmath15 .",
    "this hysteresis is probably caused by a small amount of gas absorption on the sample surface .",
    "this has the effect of suppressing the reflectivity in this range below 150 k with a maximum suppression at 20 k of about 0.5 @xmath33 .",
    "this trend was not observed in the ellipsometric data in the region of overlap .",
    "the upward kink at @xmath2 is not affected by this , but the deviation from @xmath115 behavior below 150 k could be a result of this .",
    "note that @xmath111 closely follows @xmath121 , so the temperature dependence of @xmath111 is probably not too much affected . in several other cuprates the temperature dependence of the normal state optical spectral weight is quadratic . here",
    "we observe this quadratic temperature dependence only for temperatures higher than 170 k. the coefficient of this quadratic part has been observed to be unexpectedly large and is believed to be due to correlation effects@xcite . to compare the superconductivity induced increase of @xmath111 to other compounds we express @xmath122 in mev / cu .",

    "a determination of the superconductivity induced spectral weight transfer by analysis of slope changes at @xmath2 is more reliable since this method is much less sensitive to systematic errors in the absolute value of reflectivity .",

    "figure [ tdep ] shows the measured temperature dependencies for selected photon energies . from these temperature dependencies",

    "the correlation length diverges upon approaching @xmath2 following a power law of the form @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath149=0.67 for the 3d - xy universality class .",
    "the presence of a magnetic length scale cuts off this divergence within a certain temperature window and thus broadens the transition in a field as seen in the specific heat data .",
    "the superconducting transition is thus far from being a bcs type transition where the transition temperature is reduced in a field because the cooper pairs are broken up . here",
    "@xmath2 is rather a phase - ordering transition comparable to that of superfluid 4he , albeit with a clear anisotropy . due to the lack of the exact phonon background it is not possible to estimate up to which temperatures fluctuations due to phase correlations of preformed cooper pairs exist .",
    "however , it should be noted here that no anomaly at higher temperatures is visible , suggesting a rather continuous evolution of pair correlations at higher temperatures with a continuous opening of a superconducting gap far above @xmath2 , whereas the lifetime of phase fluctuations is finite@xcite .",
    "an interesting point is that a field of 14 t has a clear influence on the fluctuations above @xmath2 ( between 100 k and 115 k ) , while no effect of an applied field has been reported for ybco@xcite .",
    "this suggests a stronger pair breaking effect by a magnetic field and thus points to a smaller upper critical field in this compound . in a bcs type superconductor the specific heat in the normal and",
    "the superconducting state is used to evaluate the thermodynamic critical field @xmath150 which is a measure of the condensation energy . in the presence of fluctuation contributions",
    "it has been argued that fluctuation contributions above @xmath2 have to be considered to calculate the real condensation energy@xcite . as the true phonon background is unknown here this calculation can not be performed .",
    "information can be obtained by comparing the size of the specific heat anomaly with that of other cuprate superconductors having a similar @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless the specific heat jump @xmath151 j gat@xmath152 k@xmath152 can be compared to @xmath153 j gat@xmath152",
    "k@xmath152 found for optimally doped bi-2212@xcite and @xmath154 j gat@xmath152 k@xmath152 for overdoped ybco@xcite ( the abbreviation gat stands for gramatom ) .",
    "the large difference to the value found in ybco can be explained by the larger contribution of fluctuation above @xmath2 in hg-1201 ( and bi-2212 ) which appears to have a larger anisotropy and thus more 2d correlations above @xmath2 .",
    "a large part of the condensation energy can thus be attributed to the smooth onset of 2d correlations of cooper pairs far above @xmath2 .",
    "the anomaly which is visible at @xmath2 represents thus only a small part of the condensation energy@xcite .",
    "if the units ev / k and data normalized per cu - atom are used , the single layer compound can be compared to the 2-layer compound bi-2212 .",
    "this leads to @xmath155=4.3@xmath156 mev k@xmath152 per copper for hg-1201 which is 3.5 times smaller than the value found for optimally doped bi-2212 @xmath157=1.5@xmath158 mev k@xmath152 per copper .    from the specific heat we estimate the change in internal energy by integrating , @xmath159dt'\\ ] ]",
    "figure [ inte ] shows a comparison between the internal energy relative to 60 k and the kinetic energy relative to 20 k defined as -@xmath160 .",
    "we find that @xmath161 is about 3 times larger than the @xmath162 , so in principle @xmath161 is large enough to account for the condensation energy .",
    "we note again that the change in internal energy is probably only a small part of the condensation energy because the fields used here are by far not enough to completely suppress superconductivity .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath163 around @xmath2 is much more gradual than the one for @xmath80u . because of the better signal - to - noise ratio of the specific heat data it is possible to observe the change in internal energy due to the phase ordering transition as a rather sharp step at @xmath2 .",
    "superimposed on this is the much more gradual change due to the 2d fluctuations .",
    "since the phase ordering transition occurs in a narrow window around @xmath2 and contributes only a small part of the change in internal energy , we are probably not able to observe this change in @xmath161 .",
    "optimally doped , single layer hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 has been investigated using optical and calorimetric techniques . from an extended drude analysis we find a reasonable agreement between the onset in absorption as seen in the optical measurements and the reported values for the gap and the resonance energy of the magnetic mode .",
    "we have presented detailed temperature dependencies of @xmath47 and @xmath46 .",
    "the in - plane superfluid plasma frequency is found to be @xmath164 @xmath15 whereas the out - of - plane @xmath100 @xmath15 .",
    "both the in - plane and out - of - plane superfluid densities fall on the scaling relation of ref [ ] . from an analysis of the temperature dependent spectral weight w(@xmath109,t ) we find that the low frequency spectral weight shows a superconductivity induced _",
    "increase_. the corresponding decrease in kinetic energy @xmath70.5 mev per copper is sufficient to explain the condensation energy extracted from the specific heat measurements .",
    "we observe a specific heat anomaly that is comparable in shape to ybco and shows a similar field dependence , but has a size of the anomaly is 10 times smaller however .",
