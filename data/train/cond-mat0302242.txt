    "the discovery@xcite of superconductivity in @xmath4 at @xmath12 opens some very interesting opportunities for practical applications of this material as a conductor in power applications.@xcite typically , the operating temperature of these conductors would be at about half the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath13 , or about @xmath14 where closed cycle refrigerators are quite efficient .",
    "early studies of the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the superconducting critical current density , @xmath15,@xcite indicated that grain boundaries in this material would carry very substantial supercurrents , @xmath16 , in conductors prepared in a variety of ways.@xcite in addition , a very early attempt to explore the use of powder - in - tube methods by jin and co - workers@xcite showed that practical conductors are feasible .    on the fundamental side , the measurement of an isotope@xcite effect with @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the isotopic mass of the boron atom indicated that phonons play a major role in the superconducting interaction in @xmath4 .",
    "for clean samples , resistivity measurements at @xmath20 indicated that @xmath21 which , combined with the calculated fermi velocity , @xcite @xmath22 , gives a mean - free - path , @xmath23 . from the measured upper critical field ,",
    "@xmath24.@xcite , the coherence distance of a clean sample can be determined from @xmath25 $ ] to be @xmath26 . here , @xmath27 is the flux quantum . with @xmath28",
    "substantially greater than @xmath29 , these materials are in the clean limit .",
    "several groups@xcite found @xmath15 values in the range of @xmath30 in self field at @xmath6 , but these values fell below @xmath31 at @xmath32 at @xmath6 . broadly speaking , the irreversibility field , @xmath33 was roughly half of @xmath34 .",
    "the primary drawback for this material appeared to be the relatively low values of the upper critical field , @xmath35,@xcite and the resulting rapid drop in @xmath15 with field .",
    "the most straight forward way to raise @xmath34 is to shorten the mean - free - path , @xmath28 , which in turn shortens the coherence distance , @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath37 $ ] would rise with decreasing @xmath28 .",
    "the introduction of point defects is an effective way to raise @xmath34 . in pure @xmath4",
    ", the volume pinning force seems to decrease as @xmath38 ^ 2 $ ] indicating that grain boundary pinning dominates.@xcite hence , reducing the grain size should help .",
    "alternatively , the strength of the pinning and @xmath15 , can be increased by introducing precipitates .",
    "typical dimensions might be an array of pinning sites with a characteristic dimension of the coherence distance , @xmath39 , and a spacing between pinning centers about @xmath40 times larger .",
    "doping of @xmath4 has proven to be difficult because relatively few impurities go into the lattice in solid solution .",
    "early reports by slusky and co - workers@xcite show that @xmath41 added by reacting powders in a solid state reaction substitute for @xmath3 in the @xmath4 lattice .",
    "there is a smooth change in lattice parameter and smooth decrease in @xmath13 for @xmath42 for @xmath43 out to @xmath44 and then a two phase region is entered . at @xmath45 , @xmath13 is still about @xmath46 and thus still relatively high .    for @xmath10 doping by solid state reaction of powders",
    ", it appears that relatively little @xmath10 is incorporated in the the @xmath4 grains .",
    "work by zhao and coworkers@xciteshowed that @xmath10 appears as very thin layers of @xmath2 precipitates on the @xmath4 grain boundaries .",
    "samples were made via solid state reaction by grinding the @xmath10 , @xmath3 , and @xmath11 powders , pressing pellets , and heat treating .",
    "microstructural analysis seemed to indicate that @xmath2 may act as a sintering agent leading to higher density , very fine @xmath4 grain - size of about @xmath47 , and excellent grain - to - grain coupling . some high resolution transmission electron microscopy evidence points to the thickness of some of these grain boundary layers being as low as one @xmath2 unit cell.@xcite",
    "because the @xmath10 does not enter the unit cell , there is relatively little diminution in @xmath13 and very substantial increases in the critical current density , @xmath15 .",
    "optimum doping was in the range of a @xmath48 ratio of about @xmath49 .",
    "one of the more important outcomes of this work was the observation that the @xmath10 seems to refine the grain structure to a grain size of about @xmath47 .    for carbon doping",
    ", rather large amounts of carbon can replace boron in the structure .",
    "takenobu and co - workers@xcite found that carbon substitutes for boron in @xmath50 out to @xmath51 as indicated by a smooth decrease in a - axis lattice parameter from @xmath52 at @xmath53 to @xmath54 at @xmath55 while @xmath13 drops from @xmath56 to about @xmath57 .",
    "there was relatively little change in the c - axis dimension . here",
    ", samples were made by mixing powders of the elements and firing at @xmath58 for @xmath59 . at higher @xmath60-values",
    ", they found that the ( 110 ) x - ray peak of @xmath4 broadens indicating two phases.@xcite .",
    "bharathi and co - workers,@xcite by contrast , found that reacting under high pressure @xmath61 , permitted the extention of carbon content to @xmath62 .",
    "they find a relatively smooth depression of @xmath13 from @xmath63 at @xmath53 to about @xmath64 at @xmath62 .",
    "using a somewhat different procedure , we have found that reacting @xmath65 with @xmath3 vapor at @xmath66 for @xmath59 gives a material with @xmath67 .",
    "in other work , the change in lattice constant and @xmath13 with carbon content also has been reported to be somewhat less than these values.@xcite    for si doping , a solid state reaction of @xmath3 and amorphous @xmath11 powder with nano - size @xmath68 particles show substantial @xmath69 lines in the x - ray data and relatively little diminution in the transition temperature to about @xmath70.@xcite this seems to imply that very little si seems to enter the @xmath4 structure . in an alternate preparation method , cooley and co - workers@xcite have shown @xmath3 can be reacted with @xmath71 at temperatures as low as @xmath72 to give @xmath69 precipitates in a @xmath4 matrix with @xmath73 .",
    "these preliminary experiments seem to indicate that the enhancements in flux pinning arise from @xmath69 precipitates rather than @xmath68 substitution into the @xmath4 lattice .",
    "the purpose of this review is to summarize progress in attempts to make @xmath4 conductors using a cvd method for depositing the starting boron material .",
    "there is a well established commercial scale method to make boron fiber in kilometer lengths for use in high strength composites .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to find ways to make doped boron fiber that will permit the preparation of long lengths of high performance @xmath4 conductor .",
    "tasks include 1 ) the development of processing methods to convert pure boron fiber to @xmath4 , 2 ) the development of methods to dope the starting boron fiber with point defects that will raise the upper critical field , @xmath34 , 3 ) the development of boron fibers that will produce nano - scale precipitates in the @xmath4 , and 4 ) the development of methods to handle the brittle character of the superconductor .",
    "chemical vapor deposition of the starting boron is a particularly attractive route to materials preparation because the impurity atoms can possibly be introduced with atomic scale dispersion .",
    "initial experiments have focussed on titanium - doping to produce small @xmath2 precipitate pinning centers with the next step to be the introduction of carbon point defects to shorten the electronic mean free path .    in a typical deposition process for boron fibers , a conducting filament such as tungsten or a carbon coated commercial silicon carbide fiber",
    "is introduced into a long glass chamber through a @xmath74 seal at a rate of a few @xmath75 . a flowing stream of @xmath76 and hydrogen gas move through the full length of the chamber .",
    "the fiber is heated electrically to temperatures in the @xmath77 range , and the boron is deposited in the hot zone .",
    "if a suitable carrier gas can be mixed with this gas stream , then impurity atoms such as @xmath10 or @xmath78 can be co - deposited with the boron to form filaments that can subsequently converted to impurity doped-@xmath4 .",
    "critical current densities were measured via magnetization as reported earlier.@xcite",
    "soon after the discovery of superconductivity@xcite in @xmath4 , small wire segments of commercial boron fiber were converted to @xmath4.@xcite these wire segments were only a few @xmath79 long and rather fragile , but they showed exceptionally low resistivity of @xmath80 at @xmath20 and a sharp superconducting transition at @xmath12 . in a subsequent series of upper critical field measurements,@xcite @xmath81 curves indicated an extrapolation to @xmath82 of about @xmath83 .",
    "critical current densities , @xmath15 for a @xmath84 diameter pure boron fiber reacted in @xmath3 vapor at @xmath58 for @xmath59 are shown for both @xmath6 and @xmath7 in fig .",
    "1 . at @xmath6 , @xmath85 in self field , and @xmath15 is about @xmath86 at @xmath87 . at @xmath7 , @xmath88 in self field , and @xmath15",
    "is about @xmath86 at @xmath89 . also shown on fig .",
    "1 are data for a sample made by depositing @xmath90 of pure boron on a carbon substrate .",
    "the @xmath6 data are the open circles and the @xmath7 data are the solid triangles . within the reproducibility of the experiments ,",
    "the @xmath84 pure boron fibers give the same @xmath15 values as samples made from @xmath90 of pure b on a c substrate within the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "for all samples , the reaction is carried out at a single temperature , and the time can then be adjusted to optimize @xmath15 if that is desired .    a series of measurements were undertaken to determine the lowest temperatures where these boron fibers would transform to @xmath4 at a high rate .",
    "a sample reacted at @xmath91 for @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , shows a @xmath3 region only part way across the boron fiber in the relatively light area near the edge of the filament .",
    "a more detailed analysis shows that this is a uniform wall of a high boron compound , @xmath92 , progressing across the fiber .",
    "energy dispersive spectra in the scanning electron microscope indicate that this phase has @xmath60 near @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "because this phase is not the study of this work , further analysis was not undertaken . for this time and temperature , essentially no @xmath95 or @xmath4 forms .",
    "the white core of the filament is @xmath96 .",
    "by contrast , if a similar pure boron fiber is heated in @xmath3 vapor at @xmath97 for @xmath98 , the fiber transforms to @xmath4 nearly everywhere as shown in fig .",
    "the darker gray areas are small regions of @xmath95 as shown by the eds line scan along the line shown , where the circle with a cross is the starting point of the scan .",
    "the large dip in @xmath3 count rate is the @xmath96 core and the @xmath99 percent dip in count rate to the left of the core illustrates the decrease in @xmath3 density going from @xmath4 to @xmath95 .",
    "also visible in the micrograph are several faults along the edge of the fiber and a large void near the right end of the portion of the @xmath96 core .",
    "the filament is not completely flat , so that the @xmath96 core does not show along the entire length of the filament for this particular depth of polish .",
    "these flaws are typical in @xmath4 filaments prepared from commercial pure @xmath11 fibers . in fig .",
    "4 , an electron micrograph is shown in end view for the long time limit where a @xmath84 diameter fiber that has been reacted in @xmath3 vapor at @xmath66 for @xmath100 .",
    "the white core of @xmath96 in the center is measured here to be @xmath101 in diameter and the starting @xmath84 boron fiber has grown to about @xmath102 diameter as @xmath3 is added .",
    "there is a small patch of @xmath95 in the upper left quadrant , and there the void pattern is very typical of all the samples grown .",
    "in the early experiments with @xmath0 doping of @xmath11 with @xmath10 , the material was deposited on either a @xmath103 substrate or a @xmath78 coated substrate , and a preliminary report of this work has been presented.@xcite most of the experiments reported here , however , were done by simultaneously depositing @xmath11 and a few percent @xmath10 on a continuous @xmath104 diameter silicon carbide filament coated with several micrometers of glassy carbon ( commercially available as scs-9a ) .",
    "deposition was accomplished in a reactor similar to that used for commercial boron filament production.@xcite the substrate filament was drawn through the reactor at @xmath105 ; the filament in the reactor was resistively heated to peak temperatures of approximately @xmath106 .",
    "the reactant gas was predominantly a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and boron trichloride at atmospheric pressure .",
    "titanium dopant was added by bubbling the hydrogen component through titanium tetrachloride held at @xmath107 .",
    "the resulting partial pressure of titanium tetrachloride was approximately @xmath108 .",
    "the doped boron - coated substrate was spooled continuously upon emerging from the reactor .",
    "an x - ray powder diffraction study of the resulting fibers before @xmath3 reaction indicates comparable amounts of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as a small amount of @xmath109 .",
    "subsequent reaction with @xmath3 vapor produced @xmath4 filaments with precipited @xmath2 .",
    "the intensity of the x - ray lines indicates less @xmath1 in the reacted fiber than in the unreacted fiber .",
    "a series of samples were prepared in which @xmath11 and @xmath10 were co - deposited on the carbon surface with thicknesses of @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "after reaction in @xmath3 vapor at both @xmath66 for @xmath59 and at @xmath106 for @xmath113 , the conversion of @xmath11 to @xmath4 was complete.@xcite an extensive study of the @xmath10 distribution was undertaken with @xmath114 in a @xmath115 where the beam size was approximately @xmath8 micrometer . generally , the @xmath116 ratio was in the neighborhood of @xmath117 in the bulk of the material .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 where a sample with @xmath111 of @xmath118 is deposited on a carbon coated substrate .",
    "there are two regions of the sample , however , that are consistently high @xmath10 .",
    "this is near the @xmath78 substrate and near the outer surface .",
    "reaction kinetics indicate that the deposition of @xmath10 compared to @xmath11 is higher at lower temperatures . hence ,",
    "as the fiber moves through the deposition zone , the @xmath10 deposition will be faster than that of boron during the initial warm - up on entrance to the hottest regions and during the cool - down as the fiber exits the hottest regions .",
    "another specimen illustrated in fig .",
    "6 shows a @xmath110 thick layer of @xmath119 . here , there are two rather distinct regions of @xmath10 content . in most of the boron layer ,",
    "the @xmath10 content is about @xmath120 , but sometimes there are bright lacy regions where the @xmath10 content is about @xmath121 . by studying polished regions of the @xmath4 with polarized light ,",
    "the grain structure is readily apparent . if a particular region of the sample is studied both with polarized light and with @xmath115 with @xmath114 area maps , the @xmath10 is found to be spread throughout the grains .",
    "the grain boundaries are not seen to be high in @xmath10 on these area maps .",
    "this result differs from the beautiful decoration of @xmath4 grain boundaries with @xmath2 seen for samples made from powders in solid state reactions.@xcite titanium doping using @xmath0 methods gives a dispersion of @xmath2 in @xmath4 that is different from that seen for solid state reaction of powders .",
    "the addition of @xmath10 greatly enhances the @xmath15 values if the level of @xmath10 doping is properly adjusted . as reported previously , anything approaching a @xmath116 ratio of 1 is far too much @xmath10.@xcite the volume fraction of superconductor is reduced by half , and the value of @xmath13 drops to about @xmath14 . in accord with earlier findings,@xcite",
    "a @xmath116 ratio in the neighborhood of @xmath122 greatly enhances both @xmath15 and @xmath33 while depressing @xmath13 only a few degrees . at @xmath6 and self field ,",
    "@xmath15 increases from about @xmath123 for pure @xmath4 to about @xmath124 for the @xmath125 sample . with increasing magnetic field , @xmath15 crosses @xmath9 at @xmath126 with @xmath125 as compared to @xmath89 for the pure @xmath4 sample as shown by the solid triangles in fig .",
    "7 . at @xmath7 , the @xmath127 sample crosses @xmath9 at about @xmath128 compared with the pure @xmath4 sample which crosses @xmath9 at @xmath129 .",
    "in addition to simply adding @xmath10 to the boron fibers , there is a great deal of optimization that can yet be done .",
    "when the starting @xmath130 fibers are prepared , there is a large amount of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the boron . during the reaction to form @xmath4 ,",
    "some of the @xmath1 is converted to @xmath2 , and there may be some migration of @xmath78 from the substrate into the sample . much more needs to be learned about both of these processes .",
    "an optimization of @xmath15 at @xmath7 with @xmath130@xcite shows that a reaction time of @xmath113 is best for a reaction temperature of @xmath106 and a reaction time of @xmath59 is best for a reaction temperature of @xmath66 .",
    "an optimization for @xmath15 values at @xmath6 , shown in fig .",
    "8 , indicates that @xmath113 at @xmath106 gives the highest @xmath15 values .",
    "for pure @xmath11 fibers deposited on a @xmath131 @xmath103 core , a series of @xmath11 fibers having diameters ranging from @xmath84 to @xmath132 were fully reacted in @xmath3 vapor at @xmath66 for times ranging from @xmath59 to @xmath133 . in all cases ,",
    "the reaction to form @xmath4 increases the fiber diameter by about @xmath134 . at @xmath6 and self field ,",
    "the @xmath15 values range from @xmath135 to @xmath136 and have a magnetic field dependence similar to those shown in fig .",
    "1 . at @xmath7 , the data of fig . 9",
    "indicate that @xmath137 nearly is independent of diameter . to the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurement ,",
    "all of these fiber diameters have the same @xmath138 plots .    for the @xmath139 deposited on a carbon coated substrate ,",
    "samples having a thickness of @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 have been studied .",
    "we expected a difference in @xmath15 among these samples caused by different amounts of @xmath78 impurity or caused by a different distribution of @xmath1 or @xmath2 during the @xmath10 and @xmath11 deposition on the @xmath78 substrate .",
    "these are relatively small effects as shown on fig . 10 .",
    "these data were taken for samples reacted at @xmath106 for @xmath140 .",
    "a reaction time less than the @xmath113 for optimum @xmath15 was intended to limit possible diffusion of @xmath78 from the substrate . in broad terms , the @xmath6 @xmath15 data are about @xmath141 at low field and the @xmath15 data cross the @xmath9 line at about @xmath142 .",
    "there is not a large thickness dependence of @xmath15 , but at high fields , the thicker samples seem to show a higher @xmath15 values . at low fields ,",
    "the thinner samples seem to show the higher @xmath15 values .",
    "similar data have been reported elsewhere.@xcite there is lots of room for improvement by optimizing the @xmath10 content , the reaction temperatures , and the reaction times .",
    "co - deposition of boron along with the desired impurities offers a distinctive method of doping .",
    "when these doped fibers are converted to @xmath4 by heating in @xmath3 vapor , the resulting @xmath2 is distributed relatively uniformly within the grains .",
    "this distribution is quite different from @xmath4 samples prepared by solid state diffusion of mixed powders .",
    "critical current densities of @xmath143 to @xmath40 million @xmath144 are obtained at @xmath6 and self field .",
    "critical current densities of @xmath9 are obtained at @xmath7 and @xmath89 .    a number of important variables are still not well understood .",
    "improvement is needed in the control of the distribution of @xmath2 , and a more thorough study of carbon doping needs to be undertaken so that a quantitative contrast can be developed between the effects of @xmath78 substitution in the lattice with the effects of @xmath2 precipitates .",
    "although there is a fairly wide sweet spot for the reaction of doped @xmath11 fibers to form doped @xmath4 , there is lots of room for improvement .",
    "the performance of the conductor can yet be optimized with respect to @xmath10 content and carbon content as well as the time and temperature of @xmath3 reaction .",
