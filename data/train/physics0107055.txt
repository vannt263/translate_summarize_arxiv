    "in this article we consider interaction of electromagnetic field with quasi - periodic media which we define as media obtained by some smooth deformation of perfect periodic structures .",
    "mathematically , the term  smooth deformation  means the biunivocal smooth mapping of the medium under consideration on the medium with perfect periodic structure .",
    "the main goal of this article is to show that the electrodynamics of quasi - periodic media can be reduced to the electrodynamics of the perfect periodic media , and , thus , to make possible application to quasi - periodical structures of well - developed classical approaches.the correspondence between perfect  and quasi - periodical media is possible when the later one is considered as the riemannian manifold with the fundamental metric tensor @xmath2 @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath5 is the deformation tensor . to clarify this statement ,",
    "let us remind , that in the mechanics of continuous medium there are two methods describing the deformation processes : the euler method and the lagrange method .",
    "the co - ordinates coincide with the observer s frame of reference in the euler method .",
    "the method of lagrange stands that the co - ordinates are mounted into a medium and are deformed together with a medium .",
    "it should be emphasized that the co - ordinates of some point of a medium in the lagrange co - ordinate system remain unchanged during the medium deformation , whereas the co - ordinates of some point of the medium in the euler co - ordinate system are being changed . in particular , the co - ordinates of bravais lattice points of a medium with perfect periodic structure , defined before the deformation by a set of three integers @xmath6 will remain constant both during the deformation and after the deformation .",
    "hence , the bravais lattice of a deformed ( quasi - periodic ) medium will look alike in the lagrange and the euler co - ordinate systems .",
    "however , it is necessary to remember , that the area engaged in a quasi - periodic medium in the lagrange co - ordinate system is a riemannian manifold with the fundamental metric tensor varying from point to point .",
    "let us give some examples how the formalism developed in this article can be used while describing the interaction of electromagnetic field with media .",
    "generally even perfect crystals can be referred rather to the quasi - periodic media , than to the media with perfect periodic structure because there are always temperature fields of deformation at least .",
    "the classic and quantum superlattices electrodynamics of semiconductors also can be referred to the electrodynamics of the quasi - periodic media when it is necessary to take into account the fields of the deformation , permanently existing in such structures . a big amount of articles devoted to the electrodynamics of the carbonic nanotubes is now published . in most cases",
    "they take into the consideration the perfectly straight nanotubes with the perfect periodic structure .",
    "actually there are always some kinds of the nanotube deformation .",
    "it is possible to reduce the electrodynamics of such nanotubes , and furthermore the electrodynamics of ensemble of nanotubes in some matrix completely to the electrodynamics of the quasi - periodic media . in real crystals",
    "the ensemble of the flaws , dislocations and impurities creates a field of deformations , which is usually divided on two parts .",
    "the first one is the averaging over the ensemble and is the smooth field of deformations .",
    "the second one describes the fluctuations of the deformations field in comparison with this smooth averaged field .",
    "the interaction of an electromagnetic field with the crystals , that have the deformation field being the averaged smooth field of deformations , can be described by methods suggested in this article .",
    "the last example to be considered is the x - ray diffraction optics of the elastically deformed perfect crystals .",
    "such crystals completely correspond to the definition of quasi - periodic media given above . from the point of view of the classical electrodynamics ,",
    "the x - ray diffraction optics is a simple version of the geometrical optics .",
    "the only complication are coupled waves inside a crystal which appear because of the dynamic diffraction . despite the distorted bragg mirror",
    "is one of the most important parts of almost all x - ray optics system , we have not seen papers correctly describing a dynamic x - rays diffraction on elastically deformed crystals with mean radius of curvature less or about @xmath7 whereas elastically deformed crystals with such media radiuses of curvature are of practical interest .",
    "takagi - taupin equations @xcite-@xcite and the series of articles ( see bibliography ) , using this equations as the basic ones are valid for elastically deformed crystals with mean radius of curvature more than @xmath8 , as will be shown in part 4 .",
    "furthermore , these papers and also paper [ 5 ] , do not show the difference between two methods describing the crystal deformation mentioned above ( euler and lagrange methods ) .",
    "the fact is also ignored that the deformed crystal in the lagrange co - ordinate system is the riemannian manifold with a fundamental metric tensor varying from point to point in the crystal .",
    "such disregardings lead to a paradoxical statement , that it is impossible to destinguish a perfect crystal and the deformed crystal in the experiments on x - ray beam passing through a crystal far away from the bragg condition . that contradicts both daily practice of x - ray beams application and classical electrodynamics because the deformed crystal is a nonuniform medium with refraction index and absorption coefficient depending on co - ordinates .",
    "the first section of this article is dedicated to the electrodynamics of media with perfect periodic structure and is being auxiliary .",
    "as the medium with periodic structure is a medium with a spatial dispersion and the relation between the vector of polarization and the electric vector is not local , the wave equation is the integro - differential one and is rather difficult to work with . in case of media with perfect periodic structure one usually proceeds to the ( @xmath9)-representation , where the integro - differential wave equation is replaced by the system of the algebraic equations .",
    "then one derives the medium eigenmodes from the dispersion equation and gains all key results of the electrodynamics of media with perfect periodic structure .",
    "such an algorithm defies the quasi - periodic media generalization , therefore in the first section we expound an unknown method , unwieldy and inconvenient on the first sight , that allows to substitute the integro - differential wave equation for the equivalent system of the differential equations , that describes the electromagnetic field dynamic diffraction by the media with perfect periodic structure .",
    "this method can be naturally generalized for the case of the quasi - periodic media .",
    "the second section is devoted to the electrodynamics of quasi - periodic media .",
    "proceeding to the lagrange co - ordinate system allows us to apply the formalism of media with perfect periodic structure developed in the first section to the quasi - periodic media almost without changes in case we consider a quasi - periodic medium in a lagrange co - ordinate system being a riemannian manifold .    in the third section",
    "we obtain the polarization tensor of a deformed crystal in the x - ray frequency band from the first principles by the joint solution of maxwell equations and von neumann s equation for a density matrix of a crystal .",
    "it is necessary to underline here , that the dependence of the debye - waller factor on the co - ordinates is ignored , the fourier - components of the polarization tensor of a deformed crystal coincide with fourier - components of the polarization tensor of a perfect crystal by the shape only in a lagrange co - ordinate system .",
    "these components appear to be very complicated co - ordinate functions in the observer system ( euler co - ordinate system ) .",
    "in the fourth section we obtain the equations system of the two - wave x - rays diffraction on the deformed crystals and after a series of simplifying approximations we show that it is possible to receive from these equations a combined takagi -taupin @xcite-@xcite equations system which appears applicable only for the deformations of the crystals with medial radius of curvature more than @xmath8 .",
    "finally in the fifth section we use a principle of the geometrical optics locality to offer a simple formula for the bragg reflection coefficient from distorted bragg mirror and describe the x - ray quanta mirror focusing .",
    "first we consider interaction of the electromagnetic field with a perfect periodic medium . for media with spatial dispersion ,",
    "the wave equation for electric field vector in @xmath10-representation has the form as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the medium polarization tensor , and @xmath13 is the current density of external sources . the intrinsic property of perfect periodic media to be translationally invariant , makes it possible to expand the polarizability tensor into the fourier series :    @xmath14    in the above equations @xmath15 is the bravais lattice vector , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are integer quantities , @xmath18 are the reciprocal lattice vectors , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the basic vectors of the bravais and reciprocal lattices , correspondingly .",

    "( [ 3 ] ) , this equation system describes the electromagnetic field dynamic diffraction by a perfect periodic medium .",
    "when the wavelength is much larger then the medium unit cell linear size , electromagnetic fields propagating in the medium can be averaged over the elementary sell and , then , a hypotatic homogeneous medium with effective constitutive parameters can be introduced into consideration instead of the real inhomogeneous one .",
    "polarization of this homogeneous medium is related to averaged electromagnetic field by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the polarization tensor which determines the linear electromagnetic response of the effective homogeneous medium .  in accordance with @xcite , the effective polarizability tensor @xmath49",

    "it is defined by its momenta :    @xmath54    the tensor @xmath51 has been evaluated analytically for some types of elementary cells @xcite . in other cases",
    "it can be done numerically .",
    "the basic assumption which the procedure of derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ 6])- ( [ 8 ] ) leaned upon , is the relation ( [ 3 ] ) accounting for the property of the polarizability tensor of perfect periodic structures to be translationally invariant . under effect of deformation , this invariance , e.g. condition ( [ 3 ] ) ,",
    "is disrupted and thus the algorithm of eqs .",
    "( 6)-([7 ] ) derivation outlined above becomes invalid .",
    "however , an appropriate modification based on the approach originated from the continuous medium mechanics can be applied to involve deformed periodic media into consideration . in the mechanics of continuous media",
    "there are two alternative methods of the deformation process description , the euler method and the lagrange method . in the framework of the first one",
    "the co - ordinate system is coupled with the viewpoint whereas the second method treats the co - ordinate system frozen into the medium and , thus , in the process of deformation the co - ordinate lines are transformed along with the medium . as a result ,",
    "the euler co - ordinates of a given point @xmath55 are changed during the deformation whereas the lagrange co - ordinates of it , @xmath56 , remain fixed .",
    "lagrange and euler co - ordinates are related to one another by @xmath57 where @xmath58 stand for the deformation field components . in particular , choosing the co - ordinate system @xmath59 to be related to the elementary translation vectors of the bravais lattice @xmath60 , @xmath61 , we find out the lagrange co - ordinates of the bravais lattice sites to be given by quantities @xmath62 both before and after the deformation .",
    "thus , one can conclude that in the lagrange co - ordinates , the bravais lattice of a deformed periodic structure looks like to the bravais lattice of a perfect periodic structure and consequently , the polarizability tensor in the lagrange co - ordinates proves to be translationally invariant .",
    "this allows us to state the relations as follows @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the reciprocal lattice covector in the lagrange co - ordinate system ; its components in the euler co - ordinates are defined by @xmath65 .",

    "further mathematical analysis accounted for the properties of the riemann manifolds allows one to extend the approach being developed to media which need not be obtained by deformation of the perfect periodic medium . in order for relation (",
    "[ 9 ] ) to hold true , a one - to - one smooth mapping ( [ 10 ] ) of the medium being considered into a perfect periodic structure is necessary and sufficient to exist .",

    "it is possible to neglect the influence on this ground state of elementary crystal excitations ( including influence of interaction with phonons ) .",

    "therefore , we will assume the hamiltonians of ground and exited states to be different .",
    "now , let us discuss how the phonon spectrum is modified under effect of the crystal deformation . in the harmonic approximation , the phonon subsystem hamiltonian of the deformed crystal in the lagrange co - ordinate system takes the form as follows : @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the @xmath166-th component of the momentum covector of the @xmath147 -th atom in the @xmath167-th cell presented in the lagrange basis .",

    "hence , we immediately obtain the dispersion equation    @xmath180    as the bravais lattice of the deformed crystal in the lagrange basis coincides with the bravais lattice of the perfect crystal in the euler co - ordinates system , the matrix @xmath181 coincides with the dynamical matrix of the perfect crystal .",

    "it is easy to verify that the proposed algorithm of accounting the influence of deformation on the crystal phonon spectrum also suits the case of anharmonic oscillations of the crystal lattice . at the end",
    "we will make two remarks .",
    "the first : since the deformation tensor @xmath196 is the essence of the smooth co - ordinates function , the equations ( [ 22])-([23 ] ) are local .",
    "the discussed above method of accounting of deformation influence on the crystal phonon spectrum is the approximation , that can be considered precise enough only when the length of the phonon free path in the crystal is less then the linear dimensions of the area where the deformation tensor variation can be observed .",
    "the second remark concerns the fact that the introduced parametric method of accounting the deformation influence on the crystal phonon spectrum is not something especially new in the solid - state physics : this method is being the standard one in accounting the deformation influence on the energy spectrum of band electrons ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "after the discussion made above let us continue the calculations of the current in the deformed crystals that was induced by x - ray quanta .",
    "first let us take up the rayleigh component of the current    @xmath197 that makes the main contribution . as @xmath198 and @xmath199 in the coulomb calibration ,",
    "using the fourier series @xmath200 , we obtain the formula for rayleigh component of the current @xmath201 the value @xmath202 is the essence of debye - waller factor where @xmath203 is to be determined by the equation  @xmath204 accordingly the debye - waller factor in the deformed crystals is the function of the deformation tensor and consequently is the function of co - ordinates determined by the equations ( [ 22])-([23 ] ) . as @xmath205 is the form factor of the @xmath147-th atom unit cell , the standard formula @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the number of the unit cells in the volume unit , allows us to obtain the final formula for the rayleigh component of the current    @xmath208 or the formula for the rayleigh component of the deformed crystal polarization tensor in the x - ray frequency range    @xmath209    in the frequency range where the x - ray quanta energy is greater then the binding energy of any electron in the crystal , the current component describing the absorption of quanta by the atoms and the consequent decay of the exited state which atom passed into by means of quantum absorption is usually much smaller then the rayleigh component ( in the x - ray optics it is called the dispersion correction ) .",
