    "one possibility is that some high - energy process in the early universe ( like inflation or a cosmological phase transition ) generated primordial magnetic fields which manifest today as galactic or cluster fields @xcite .",

    "a detailed numerical investigation of cmb signals due to tangled magnetic fields has also been undertaken in @xcite .",
    "the first year results from wmap satellite observations however indicate that the universe could have undergone an early stage of re - ionization @xcite , with a large optical depth @xmath9 to the re - scattering of cmb photons . in this paper",
    "we follow up our earlier work by investigating the consequences of a tangled primordial magnetic field , for cmb anisotropies , in a scenario with early re - ionization .",
    "in particular we focus on the rotational perturbations , that are produced by primordial fields in the post - recombination universe , and the additional cmb anisotropy signals that they induce in a universe with early re - ionization .",
    "note that compressive velocity modes could also induce cmb anisotropies ; however they also have non magnetic sources and more importantly suffer larger cancellation effects due to the thickness of the last scattering surface around the re - ionization epoch .",
    "hence , our focus is only on rotational modes here .    in section",
    "ii the general formulation of the problem and the parameters of re - ionization relevant for our calculation are derived .",
    "semi - analytic estimates of the additional cmb signals are made in section iii . in section",
    "iv we present numerical calculations and in section v we discuss our results .",
    "the equations for the evolution of temperature anisotropy for scalar , vector and tensor modes have been derived by hu and white @xcite ( hereafter referred to as hw97 ) .",

    "however re - ionization can modify this further by making @xmath24 significant after the universe has been re - ionized , the exact modification depending on the complex ionization history of the baryons .",
    "the modifications of the visibility function will show up in the power spectrum of the anisotropy . in this paper",
    "we will not be focusing our attention on the physical mechanism responsible for re - ionization .",
    "we will , however , assume that whatever be the source , it results in a sharp transition to a re - ionized situation .",
    "we assume this transition to be a step function at a redshift @xmath25 corresponding to a conformal time @xmath26 . the value of @xmath26 is fixed in this simple model by the optical depth indicated by the wmap results .",

    ", we can calculate the form of the visibility function .",
    "we will use this form for the visibility function in the numerical computation in section [ numres ] .",
    "however , to begin with , we approximate the visibility function @xmath58 after recombination , to be a truncated exponential , and estimate the cmb anisotropy in a semi - analytic manner .",
    "specifically , we adopt , @xmath59 here the heavyside @xmath60 function , is zero for @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "it takes account of the fact that before re - ionization , @xmath64 is negligible .",
    "further , @xmath65 is a normalization consant and @xmath66 gives the spread of the exponential . by appropriately choosing @xmath66",
    ", we can set the width of the reionized last scattering surface . also note that @xmath23 has the interpretation of probability ; so its integral over @xmath33 from @xmath67 to @xmath68 should be normalized to unity .",
    "this determines the normalization factor @xmath65 .",
    "for a sufficiently early epoch of re - ionization , we generally have @xmath69 . in this case , the condition that the integral of @xmath23 over @xmath33 should be unity implies @xmath70 , or @xmath71 .",

    "consider first the limiting case when @xmath90 is more sharply peaked than @xmath76 .",
    "this implies the limit @xmath91 . on using the values of @xmath72 , @xmath26 and @xmath66 determined above this limit",
    "translates to @xmath92 .",
    "we will also assume that the source term @xmath93 varies slower than either the variation of @xmath76 or that of @xmath90 .",
    "these approximations will help in understanding the effect of the model with re - ionization in a semi - analytic manner .",
    "results of numerical calculations which do not make these approximations are given in the section [ numres ] .",
    "since we wish to focus on the effects of re - ionization we take the visibility function to be @xmath76 in the integral appearing in equation ( [ cl ] ) , which then becomes , @xmath94 the function , @xmath90 peaks at @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "so in the above integral we evaluate @xmath97 and @xmath58 at @xmath98 and replace @xmath99 by @xmath16 and move them out of the integral .",

    "these can be estimated as in @xcite by using the euler equation for the baryons and we give a detailed derivation in appendix a.    further , in order to compute the ensemble average @xmath113 and hence the @xmath114s , we need the magnetic spectrum @xmath115 .",

    "specifically , we numerically evaluate the integral in equation ( [ cl ] ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , the visibility function appearing in this integral has a dominant contribution at the epoch of standard recombination and another at the epoch of re - ionization .",
    "the contribution at the epoch of re - ionization we have denoted by @xmath76 and we are interested in the additional contribution to @xmath101 resulting from @xmath76 . unlike the semi - analytic case , ( where we approximated @xmath76 as an exponential decay for epochs later than the re - ionization epoch ) we use the form given in equation ( [ g ] ) with the number the number density of the electrons as given in equation ( [ ne_theta_f ] ) .",

    "we can neglect the accelerated phase of the universe , as this phase is believed to have set in at a low redshift ( @xmath164 ) by which time , the visibility function would have decayed sufficiently .",
    "hence , this will not introduce any significant error in our computation . with these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "we have computed @xmath165 by evaluating the @xmath33 and @xmath12 integrals numerically in eq ( [ cl ] ) .",
    "while evaluating this we have retained the analytical expression for @xmath140 given in equation ( [ i2-b ] ) . for @xmath166 nano gauss and a nearly scale invariant spectrum ( @xmath151 ) we find @xmath167 for @xmath168 . for higher @xmath169 the fluctuations are larger .",
    "the results of the numerical calculation are shown in figure 1 , for the magnetic spectral index @xmath151 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "we can compare this with the semi - analytic results from equation ( [ large_l ] ) .",
    "for @xmath151 , our semi - analytic calculations give @xmath172 for @xmath168 .",
    "so we see that although the semi - analytic calculation marginally underestimates the temperature anisotropy , we do get the correct order .",

    "indeed both the amplitude of @xmath165 and its @xmath16 dependence , computed using the semi - analytic calculation , agrees reasonably well with the more exact numerical integration .",
    "we have investigated the additional cmb temperature anisotropies that are generated by tangled cosmological magnetic fields in a universe that underwent a relatively early re - ionization .",
    "we are motivated by wmap results , which indicate that the universe could have been re - ionized as early as @xmath179 .",
    "we have focused for the present on rotational velocity perturbations , which can be substained only by cosmological magnetic fields .",
    "these modes also suffer a milder damping due to the finite thickness of the re - ionized last scattering surface , than compressional modes .",
    "our results supplement earlier work obtained in the context of a universe that does not undergo re - ionization .",
    "we find that a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of tangled magnetic fields ( with @xmath151 to @xmath174 ) , which redshift to a present day value of about @xmath149 nano gauss can produce anisotropies at the level of about @xmath180k to @xmath181k for @xmath178 .",
    "even larger signals would obtain if we were to consider models with larger @xmath169 .",
    "we have simply stopped at this large @xmath16 because we can not use linear theory at present to calculate the expected signals for @xmath16 larger than @xmath182 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , at these large @xmath16 , the above signals are comparable to primary signals due to tangled fields , arising from the usual recombination epoch @xcite .",
    "cmbr anisotropy experiments which probe such very small angular scales can thus be useful to measure or impose bounds on the magnitude as well as the spectral index of these magnetic fields .",
    "we have also considered here only the simplest first order effects due to re - ionization",
    ". it would be of interest also to estimate the effects of an inhomogeneous re - ionization on the cmb anisotropy from vector modes .",
    "we need to calculate the rotational velocity field of the baryons in the post - recombination era , in particular around the epoch of re - ionization .",
    "we shall follow the formalism developed by wasserman @xcite . here",
    "we summarize briefly the essential features of the derivation based on wasserman s paper .    the fourier space , linearized euler equation for the rotational component of the baryon velocity in the post recombination era is given by , @xmath183 here @xmath184 is the fourier component of the rotational velocity perturbation",

    "note that @xmath188 is the magnitude of the vector @xmath184 , that is @xmath189 .",
    "we have also assumed here , ( as mentioned in the text ) that on large enough scales , larger than @xmath190 , the velocities are so small that the magnetic field does not get significantly distorted , but simply redshifts away as @xmath191 .",
    "the above equation can be solved in a straightforward fashion to obtain the rotational component of the velocity field .",
    "note that in the post - recombination era , we can neglect the radiation density compared to the matter density .",
    "further , the dark energy component dominated over matter at late times , _",
    "i.e. _ , at redshift less than unity , whereas the results from wmap can be interpreted to mean that the universe underwent a re - ionization phase at an earlier time .",
    "thus from the epoch of recombination ( @xmath192 ) , till the epoch of re - ionization ( @xmath193 ) , pressureless matter was the dominant component of the universe .",
