    "the tunka eas cherenkov array is located in tunka valley , at an altitude of @xmath2  m a.s.l . , and was described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "extensive air showers in an energy range @xmath3 to @xmath4 ev have been simulated with corsika .",
    "the total amount of 600 corsika events has been simulated for primary protons and iron nuclei and for three zenith angles 0@xmath5 , 15@xmath5 and 25@xmath5 .",
    "the ldf consists of two branches : one almost exponential from the core to some distance @xmath6 , the other following a power law from @xmath6 up to 350 m : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 the main difference to the expression suggested in @xcite is the use of variable power law index for the second branch .",
    "all three partial parameters defining the ldf shape , @xmath11 , @xmath6 and @xmath12 , are strict functions of a single steepness parameter @xmath13 , defined as the ratio of cherekov light fluxes at core distances 100 and 200 m : @xmath14 .",
    "examples of fitting the simulated ldf with equation 1 for different parameters @xmath13 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 and the light flux at a fixed core distance 175  m , @xmath15 , have been determined for every simulated event .",
    "the essential correlations of parameter pairs @xmath16 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath17 and @xmath13 , and the standard deviations of their distibutions , separately for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , have been extracted from this corsika simulation in order to use them in a special code called `` model of experiment '' .",
    "two intermediate nuclear groups , corresponding to primaries @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been added to the `` model '' using an interpolation of parameters , obtained for @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the real geometry of the array and the response of every detector and it s fluctuations are taken into account in the model .",
    "the `` model of experiment '' permits a fast generation of @xmath22 artificial events , distributed with a realistic energy spectrum , for different assumptions concerning the primary mass composition .",
    "it allows to analyse the array response , including the analysis of details of the program of eas parameter reconstruction , the efficiency of registration of eas , the threshold of the total array , errors and possible distortions of the reconstructed energy @xmath16 , and the depth of the shower maximum @xmath23 .",
    "the `` model of experiment '' , assuming a complex mass composition ( ) , has shown that for energies @xmath24 ev , our procedures of relative calibration of the detectors and the eas parameter reconstruction result in accuracies of primary energy determination of @xmath25% , of the core position of @xmath265 m and of @xmath23 of @xmath2630 g/@xmath27 . for energies below @xmath28",
    "the errors are larger .",
    "the threshold of data acquisition with 100% ( 50% ) efficiency is @xmath29 ev ( @xmath30 ev )",
    ". some other conclusions of the `` model '' will be discussed later .",
    "the primary energy @xmath16  [ tev ] has been obtained from @xmath15  [ @xmath31 with the relation : @xmath32 the absolute energy calibration is based on the results obtained with the quest experiment @xcite .",
    "figure 2 presents the differential energy spectrum , derived from data taken in @xmath33  hours , spread over about @xmath34 clear , moonless nights , with a trigger rate above @xmath35  hz . to construct a spectrum , showers with zenith angles @xmath36 and a core position inside the geometrical area of the array have been selected .",
    "we note that particularly at the lowest and the highest energies , the new fit functions performs significantly better than that used in @xcite .",
    "the lateral and the time distributions of the cherenkov light provide two independent methods to estimate the depth of the eas maximum .",
    "the first is the measurement of the ldf steepness @xmath13 , which is related to the distance to the shower maximum by the expression @xmath17 ( in  [ km ] ) : @xmath37 .",
    "this relation is almost independent of other details of the simulation : energy , sort of nucleus , zenith angle and model of hadron interaction .",
    "the distribution of @xmath17 for a fixed @xmath13 has a standard deviation of only 0.3 km .",
    "the depth of the eas maximum @xmath23 is derived from @xmath17 using the atmosphere parametrs consistent with really observed ( the mean temperature during the observations is -20@xmath5c ) .",
    "the `` model of experiment '' gives an error of 30  g/@xmath27 for the experimental depth of the eas maximum @xmath23 .",
    "the second method is measuring the cherenkov pulse full width on half maximum ( fwhm ) . in accordance with corsika simulations as described above , the fwhm  [ ns ] at distances larger than @xmath38  m from the eas axis is related to the relative position of the eas maximum : @xmath39  [ g/@xmath27 ] ,  where @xmath41 is the total depth of the atmosphere and @xmath42 is the zenith angle of the shower .",
    "the relation between fwhm and @xmath43 depends only on the distance to the eas axis , and is almost independent on the other details of the simulation : energy , sort of nucleus and model of hadron interaction .",
    "for example , for a distance of @xmath44  m , one obtains @xmath45 .",
    "the underlying theoretical uncertainties for this method are smaller than for the first one .",
    "figure  3 presents the mean depth of the eas maximum , derived with the two methods described above , as a function of primary energy .",
    "the `` model of experiment '' shows that there is no influence of the array threshold on the obtained @xmath23 , starting from an energy @xmath46 ev .",
    "it is seen from fig.3 that the threshold of the fwhm method is higher than that of the ldf steepness method , but the mean depths , obtained with the two different methods are in good agreement .",
    "both methods result in large fluctuations of mean points at low statistics ( high energy ) , as expected for a very asymmetric distribution like that of @xmath47 .",
    "experimental @xmath47 distributions for eas in the energy range 3  10 pev are shown in fig 4 .",
    "all the values of @xmath47 are re - normalized to a fixed energy of @xmath48  ev , using an experimental elongation rate of ( @xmath49 ) g/@xmath27 . the experimental distribution is compared to distributions simulated with the `` model of experiment '' , for different assumptions on primary composition , and re - normalized in the same way as the experimental one .",
    "the agreement with experimental data is better for the complex composition ( ) , than for pure @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "so the intermediate mass composition is more probable , but it should be noticed that the difference between simulated and experimental standard deviation is significant only for pure @xmath18 or @xmath19 . for a wide range of intermediate compositions , mixtures of mass components lead to standard deviations similar to those marked as `` complex '' in the figure .",
    "the mean value of the simulated distribution depends on hadron interaction model . in fig .  3 , @xmath47 vs. energy",
    "is displayed for two models qgsjet-01 @xcite and qgsjet - ii @xcite .",
    "all other models used in corsika yield lines between these borders @xcite .",
    "one sees , that a conclusion about the mean mass composition strongly depends on the chosen hadron interaction model . to solve the problem with the model",
    "the measurement of energy dependence of @xmath47 in much wider energy range is very essential .",
    "this is one of the reasons of our decision to spread our measurement to lower energy with the new version of tunka-25 cherenkov light detectors supplied with spheric mirrors of 1 m diameter . to the other hand",
    "the new experiment tunka-133 @xcite with effective area 10 times higher than that of tunka-25 is under construction in tunka valley .",
    "the authors are thankful to professor gianni navarra and the eas - top collaboration for the opportunity to carry out the calibration experiment quest at the eas - top array .",
