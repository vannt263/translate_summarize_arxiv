    "numerous extensions of the standard model ( sm ) predict the existence of new neutral gauge bosons @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this class of gauge bosons can be associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of additional @xmath5 gauge groups or with kaluza - klein excitations of theories with extra compact dimensions  @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the most interesting option is the breaking of these @xmath5 at around tev scales , giving rise to extra neutral gauge bosons observable at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "although the lhc has been designed to solve the higgs puzzle , it is possible that in the first stage of its running signals of new physics show up , such as the resonance produced by a new @xmath4 gauge boson decaying into charged leptons  @xcite . therefore , it is worth investigating the phenomenology of this particle . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the @xmath4 gauge boson predicted by the minimal @xmath6 model  @xcite , which predicts new physics at the tev scale .",
    "in particular , we are interested in studying the rare decay of this @xmath4 gauge boson into three photons",
    ". these types of decays are naturally suppressed in renormalizable theories , as they first arise at the one - loop level . the analogous decay in the sm @xmath1 is quite suppressed , with a decay width of the order of @xmath7 gev  @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "the fermionic contribution was calculated in an approximate way more than two decades ago  @xcite and some years after the complete analytical results were presented  @xcite .",
    "as the @xmath8 gauge boson contribution is concerned , it was presented in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the fermionic-@xmath8 interference is significant .",
    "since there are no charged scalars particles in the sm this kind of contribution only occurs in models with extended higgs sectors . in  @xcite",
    "such a contribution is analyzed in the context of the popular two higgs doublet model and the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "it was found that this contribution is several orders of magnitude lower than the fermionic and @xmath8 contributions .",
    "a more general analysis of the contribution of all three types of particles to this decay was presented in  @xcite .",
    "as already commented , we are interested in studying the @xmath0 decay in the context of the minimal @xmath6 model  @xcite .",
    "this model , which is based in the @xmath2 gauge group , has attracted the attention of numerous authors in the past decade , mainly because it possesses some peculiar features that are not present in other sm extensions .",
    "its more interesting property is that anomalies do not cancel in each generation independently as in the sm , but such a cancelation occurs only when the three generations are taken into account together .",
    "the cancellation mechanism requires that the number of families must be an integer multiple of the color number .",
    "this fact , together with the property of asymptotic freedom of qcd , which establishes that the color number is less than five , implies that the 331 model predicts the existence of only three fermionic families .",
    "another interesting property of the minimal version of this model is that the weak angle is subject to the constraint @xmath9",
    "@xcite and @xmath10 stand for sine and cosine of the weak angle @xmath11 . ] .",
    "it results that , when it is evolved to high values , the model loses its perturbative character at a scale about @xmath12 tev  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath13 is very close to @xmath14 leads to an upper bound on the scale associated with the first stage of ssb , when the @xmath2 group is broken down into the sm group @xmath15 , which translates directly into the gauge bosons that acquire masses at this scale , among them the @xmath4 gauge boson  @xcite .",
    "then , the 331 model is phenomenologically well motivated to be probed in the lhc .    in the minimal 331 model",
    "the lepton spectrum is the same as in the sm , but it is arranged in antitriplets of the gauge group @xmath16 . the quark sector is also arranged in the fundamental representation of this group , which requires the introduction of three new quarks . along with the @xmath4 boson ,",
    "four additional charged gauge bosons are predicted by the minimal 331 model : two singly charged bosons @xmath17 and two doubly charged ones @xmath18 .",
    "these gauge bosons carry two units of lepton number and so have been classified as bileptons  @xcite .",
    "the new gauge bosons together with the exotic quarks are endowed with mass at the first stage of ssb , when @xmath19 is broken into @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath21 is completely embedded into @xmath16 , the couplings between the sm and the extra gauge bosons are determined by the coupling constant @xmath22 associated with the @xmath21 group and the weak angle @xmath11  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal 331 model consists of three triplet and one sextet , but only one triplet is needed to break down @xmath19 into @xmath20 . at this stage , the higgs sector consists of three doublets and one triplet of @xmath21 , as well as of four complex singlets  @xcite . after breaking the usual electroweak group into the electromagnetic one ,",
    "the physical scalar sector is composed by : five neutral cp - even @xmath23 , three neutral cp - odd @xmath24 , four charged @xmath25 , and three doubly charged @xmath26 , from which only @xmath27 is light , with mass of the order of the fermi scale @xmath28  @xcite . in a previous communication by some of us",
    "@xcite , a comprehensive analysis of tree - level two - body decays of @xmath4 , including the one - loop induced ones @xmath29 and @xmath30 , was performed in the context of the minimal 331 model .",
    "our main goal in this work is to investigate the sensitivity of the @xmath31 @xmath32 decays to virtual effects of new particles of spin @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 living at the tev scale . as already commented , one interesting peculiarity of the @xmath6 model is the presence of new particles with a charge content that differs from that carried by the known particles .",
    "exotic particles with a charge content @xmath36 in units of the positron charge may enhance substantially the amplitude of the @xmath37 vertex , as it is proportional to @xmath38 , which in turns leads to a probability proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "this class of effect was studied by some of us some years ago in light by light scattering , showing that this process is quite sensitive to the contribution of the doubly charged bileptons , as they modify the cross section by an additional factor of @xmath40  @xcite . in some more recent communications by some of us ,",
    "the impact of the exotic quarks on the rare @xmath41  @xcite and @xmath42  @xcite decays was studied .",
    "all the new charged particles that predict the model receive their mass at the first stage of ssb , so that a good strategy to estimate the impact of scalars , fermions , and vectors to the @xmath31 decay is to assume that each set of these three types of particles are mass degenerate .",
    "accordingly , the impact of the three exotic quarks , two of them ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) with charge content of @xmath45 , and the third one ( @xmath46 ) with charge @xmath47 , is @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact of the simple and doubly charged bileptons is @xmath49 . as far as the four simply charged and three doubly charged higgs bosons is concerned",
    ", their impact would be proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "the rest of the paper has been organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ m ] a brief discussion of the @xmath6 model is presented .",
    "section [ a ] is devoted to present compact analytical expressions for the amplitudes associated with the @xmath31 decay , with @xmath51 . in sec .",
    "[ rd ] , we discuss our results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ c ] the conclusions are presented .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the lepton spectrum of the model is the same as in the sm and are accommodated as antitriplets of @xmath16 : @xmath52 notice that @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . in order to cancel the @xmath16 anomaly ,",
    "the same number of fermion triplets and antitriplets is necessary .",
    "this requires one to arrange two quark generations as triplets and the other one as an antitriplet .",
    "it is customary to choose the third generation as the one transforming as antitriplet in order to distinguish the new dynamic effects in the physics of the quark top from that of the lighter generations .",
    "accordingly , the three generations are specified as follows : @xmath55 @xmath56 on the other hand , the right - handed quarks are specified as follows : @xmath57 @xmath58 in the first stage of ssb , when the @xmath19 group is broken into the usual electroweak group @xmath20 , only the three new quarks @xmath59 , and @xmath46 acquire masses .",
    "these exotic quarks arise as singlets of the @xmath21 group , so they do not couple to the @xmath8 gauge boson . however , they do couple to both the @xmath60 and @xmath4 gauge bosons  @xcite .    on the other hand , as already commented in the introduction , the higgs sector of the minimal 331 model is comprised of three triplets and one sextet of @xmath16 : @xmath61    @xmath62    to break @xmath19 into @xmath20 , only the @xmath63 scalar triplet of @xmath16 is required .",
    "the hypercharge is identified as a linear combination of the broken generators @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 , with @xmath67 a gell - mann matrix and @xmath68 .",
    "the next stage of ssb occurs at the fermi scale and is achieved by the two triplets @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the sextet @xmath71 is necessary to provide realistic masses for the leptons  @xcite . in these expressions @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "are all doublets of @xmath21 with hypercharge 3 , 1 , 1 , and 1 , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath46 is an @xmath21 triplet with @xmath76 , whereas @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are all singlets of @xmath21 with hypercharge @xmath80 @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the extra @xmath4 boson , the bileptons and the exotic quarks get masses at the first stage of ssb through the vacuum expectation value @xmath83 .",
    "the bileptons form a @xmath21 doublet with hypercharge @xmath84 .",
    "the spectrum of physical gauge particles is the following .",
    "the charged gauge bosons are given by @xmath85    @xmath86    with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "the hierarchy of the ssb yields a splitting between the bilepton masses given by @xmath90 .",
    "however , to simplify the discussion we will consider only the degenerate case .    in the neutral sector ,",
    "the gauge fields @xmath91 define three mass eigenstates @xmath92 via the following rotation : @xmath93    @xmath94    where the mixing angle is @xmath95 with @xmath96 and @xmath97 standing for the sm @xmath60 boson . in this paper",
    ", we will work in the approximation @xmath98 , so @xmath97 and @xmath99 coincide with @xmath60 and @xmath4 , respectively .    to calculate the amplitudes for the @xmath31 decay , we need the feynman rules for the couplings of @xmath60 and @xmath4 to all the charged particles of the model",
    ". the couplings of @xmath60 and @xmath4 to leptons and quarks , including the exotic ones , are all given in  @xcite and we refrain from including them here .",
    "the couplings of these particles with photons are dictated by spinorial electrodynamics .",
    "as far as the couplings of the neutral gauge bosons @xmath100 , @xmath60 , and @xmath4 with the charged ones @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , they depend on the gauge - fixing procedure used to quantize the theory .",
    "the calculation of these contributions are greatly simplified if one uses a nonlinear gauge - fixing procedure . to carry out the @xmath101 contribution we used a covariant gauge - fixing procedure as the one presented in  @xcite .",
    "as far as the bilepton contribution is concerned , we used the feynman rules that arise from the gauge - fixing procedure used in  @xcite .",
    "the feynman rules for all possible couplings among the neutral and charged gauge bosons of the minimal 331 model can be found at the appendix  [ fr ] .",
    "some of these gauge bosons rules have been worked in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the coupling of charged scalars to photons are model independent , as they are dictated by scalar electrodynamics .",
    "consequently , we only need the couplings of all the charged scalars with the @xmath60 and @xmath4 gauge bosons .",
