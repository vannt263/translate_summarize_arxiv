    "rotational instabilities are potentially important in the evolution of massive stellar cores . for example",
    ", the core of a massive star that has been prevented from collapsing to neutron star densities by centrifugal forces may rotate rapidly enough for rotational instabilities to develop @xcite .",
    "massive cores spun up by accretion from a binary companion @xcite and the remnants of compact binary mergers @xcite may also reach fast enough rotation rates to become unstable .",
    "rotational instabilities may produce detectable gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "if enough angular momentum is shed , full collapse to a neutron star or black hole may occur .",
    "we focus here on global rotational instabilities that arise in fluids from growing azimuthal modes @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "dynamical instabilities are driven by hydrodynamics and gravity , and grow on the order of the dynamical timescales of the system . in objects with maclaurin - like rotation laws , dynamical rotational instabilities",
    "are generally expected to arise at fairly high values of @xmath6 in newtonian gravity ( see new , centrella , & tohline and references therein ) , and @xmath7 in general relativity @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath8 is the rotational kinetic energy , and @xmath9 is the gravitational potential energy . dynamical instability may set in at lower values of @xmath10 for thick , self - gravitating disks @xcite and in tori @xcite .",
    "secular instabilities develop on longer timescales , and arise from dissipative processes such as viscosity and gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "they are expected to set in for relatively low values of @xmath11 , although the rotation law , polytropic index , and general relativity can affect the value of the instability limit @xcite .",
    "studies of scenarios for the formation of centrifugally - hung cores have generally concluded that these objects will have @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations of axisymmetric stellar collapse by @xcite also indicate that , for the cases studied , it is difficult for collapsing cores to reach and exceed @xmath13 .",
    "overall , it is generally assumed that centrifugally - hung cores will evolve secularly , as in the `` fizzler '' scenario @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we report on new 3-d numerical simulations of rotating stellar cores that exhibit dynamical rotational instability at relatively low values of @xmath11 .",
    "these models are computed using newtonian gravity with no backreaction ; this is a reasonable approximation for a stellar core of mass @xmath14 hung up at a radius @xmath15 km , so that @xmath16 .",
    "our results show that compact objects can become dynamically unstable in a region of parameter space previously thought to be solely the province of secular instabilities .",
    "rotating stellar cores are initially assumed to be axisymmetric equilibrium polytropes with equation of state @xmath17 , with @xmath18 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the angular velocity distribution is given by the so - called @xmath19constant rotation law , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the cylindrical radius and @xmath22 is an arbitrary constant @xcite .",
    "as @xmath23 , the specific angular momentum approaches the constant value @xmath24 .",
    "here , we use @xmath25 . the models are computed on a uniformly spaced @xmath26 grid using the self - consistent field method of @xcite .",
    "varying the axis ratio yields equilibria with different values of @xmath10 ; see @xcite for details .",
    "figure  [ init - mods ] shows density contours in the @xmath27 plane for the 4 models that we evolved here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "notice that , with the exception of the @xmath30 model , the density maxima are toroidal ; similar structures were used as initial data in the collapse models of @xcite .",
    "these initial models were introduced into 2 different 3-d hydrocodes .",
    "the first of these is the l code discussed in @xcite , with a cylindrical @xmath31 grid of @xmath32 zones .",
    "the second is the ppm code discussed by @xcite , with a cartesian @xmath33 grid of @xmath34 zones .",
    "both codes have the same resolution along the @xmath35 and @xmath36axes , with the equatorial radius @xmath37 of the initial model extending out to zone 48 in @xmath35-direction .",
    "the cylindrical code imposes equatorial plane symmetry , whereas the cartesian code imposes no symmetries .",
    "random perturbations of 1% were imposed on the densities , and the models were evolved forward in time .",
    "the model with initial @xmath38 exhibits a dynamical instability that is very similar in simulations performed with both the cylindrical and cartesian hydrocodes .",
    "these runs were stopped when the loss of mass from the edge of the grid became significant .",
    "figure  [ contours - cyl ] shows density contours in the equatorial plane from the run with the cylindrical code . the green ( lightest greyscale ) contour in the first frame delineates the toroidal density maximum seen in fig .",
    "[ init - mods ] .",
    "as time proceeds , this torus `` pinches off '' to leave a single high density region , indicative of an @xmath2 mode . at late times , the appearance of higher density contours signals that the dense region is starting to collapse .",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath39 , which is the dynamical time for a _ sphere _ of mass @xmath40 and radius @xmath37 . for @xmath41",
    "km , @xmath42 ms .",
    "3-d animations of the evolution of this model , using the same contour levels as in figure  [ contours - cyl ] and looking down the @xmath36axis towards the equatorial plane , are available for both the cylindrical and cartesian runs .",
    "additional animations , in which the model is viewed from the side , are also available for the cylindrical and cartesian runs .",
    "[ note to editors : here , the words `` cylindrical '' and `` cartesian '' should link to the animations in each case . ]",
    "we can quantify the instability by examining various fourier components in the density distribution .",
    "we examine the density in a ring of fixed @xmath21 and @xmath43 using a complex azimuthal fourier decomposition , where the amplitudes @xmath44 of the various components @xmath45 are defined by @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the normalized amplitude is then @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mean density in the ring , and the phase angle of the @xmath49 component is @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "we write the phase angle @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the eigenfrequency and @xmath53 is the pattern speed of the @xmath49 mode",
    ".    figures  [ modes - cyl ] and  [ modes - crt ] show the growth of the amplitudes @xmath54 for the first four fourier components in the runs with @xmath55 on the cylindrical and cartesian hydrocodes , respectively .",
    "for the cylindrical code , these amplitudes were calculated in the equatorial plane in a ring of width @xmath56 at radius @xmath57 ; see @xcite for details . for the cartesian code ,",
    "the amplitudes were computed on a circle of radius @xmath58 using a nonuniform discretization , which avoids grid boundaries , and a linear interpolation of density .",
    "similar results were found in rings at other values of @xmath21 .",
    "the evolution in both runs is dominated by an exponentially growing @xmath2 mode ( thick solid line ) .",
    "once this mode is well into its exponential growth phase , an @xmath59 mode also develops , followed at later times by @xmath60 and @xmath61 modes .",
    "( the constant amplitude @xmath61 signal in the cartesian run is due to the geometry of the numerical grid . ) since these modes grow rapidly on dynamical timescales , they signal dynamical instability",
    ". numerical values for the growth rates , eigenfrequencies , and pattern speeds are shown in table  [ modes ] for @xmath2 and @xmath59 .",
    "notice that the cylindrical and cartesian runs yield similar results and that the pattern speeds @xmath62 , indicating that the @xmath59 mode is a harmonic of the @xmath2 mode .",
    "longer runs with larger grids and higher resolution are needed to obtain reliable values for the @xmath60 and @xmath61 modes .",
    "the model with @xmath63 also exhibits dynamical instability . for the evolutions run with both codes",
    ", the @xmath2 mode grew at very close to the same rate , starting at about the same time ; see table  [ modes ] . in the run on the cylindrical code ,",
    "the modes @xmath64 and @xmath4 appear sequentially in time and @xmath62 , as in the model with @xmath38 . in the run on the cartesian code ,",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath59 modes both grew at about the same rate , starting at about the same time ; however , @xmath65 . at this stage",
    ", we do not understand this difference in the behavior of the @xmath59 mode in this case .",
    "we plan to investigate it using higher resolution simulations .",
    "the @xmath66 model was run for @xmath67 , at which time the @xmath2 mode was just beginning to grow ; longer runs with higher resolution are needed to confirm the development of instability in this case . the model with @xmath68",
    "was run for @xmath69 , and showed no growing modes . in the event that we can confirm instability for @xmath66",
    ", we will return to the @xmath68 case and run it further .",
    "previous studies of the @xmath59 bar - mode instability using the cylindrical hydrocode showed that significant motion of the system center of mass could develop at late times , resulting in a spurious @xmath2 signal @xcite .",
    "for the simulations reported here , we monitored the position of the overall center of mass and verified that it underwent no systematic motion during the development of the @xmath2 mode , in both the cylindrical and cartesian codes . when the runs with @xmath55 and @xmath70 were stopped , some small , spurious center of mass motion ( @xmath71 one zone ) had developed in both codes .",
    "this effect is possibly related to the loss of mass from the grid as the outer regions expand ; runs with larger grids are needed to determine the late time behavior of these models .",
    "previous studies of the bar instability using the cartesian code @xcite showed that angular momentum losses due to numerical inaccuracies can be signficant .",
    "for the @xmath72 and @xmath73 simulations with the cartesian code , the artificial angular momentum losses amounted to less than @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "our results demonstrate that dynamical instability can occur in differentially rotating polytropes with low values of @xmath76 , and that this instability has a strong , @xmath2 character .",
    "figure  [ init - mods ] shows that the unstable axisymmetric equilibria each have a torus of dense material centered on the rotation axis within the model .",
    "this suggests that this instability may be related to the ones found by @xcite and @xcite in their studies of polytropic tori with @xmath77 .",
    "we note that @xcite also found a dominant @xmath2 instability that set in at a relatively low @xmath78 , in a centrally condensed model ( without an off - center density maximum ) .",
    "their model was an @xmath77 polytrope with an @xmath79 rotation law .",
    "the @xmath79 rotation law produces configurations with a strong concentration of angular momentum in the outer regions of the model .",
    "we plan to carry out more detailed studies to investigate the character of the unstable modes seen in our simulations and their properties for various values of @xmath80 and the @xmath81-constant rotation law parameter @xmath22 .",
    "if such instability occurs in a centrifugally - hung core , collapse to neutron star densities may result .",
    "our simulations do show that the density is increasing at the end of the unstable runs .",
    "further studies are needed to see how dense the remnant actually becomes , and whether the @xmath2 mode will result in the dense region moving at a velocity comparable to those of actual neutron stars @xcite .",
    "dynamical instability will also produce gravitational radiation .",
    "although longer runs are needed to obtain the full gravitational waveforms , we can estimate the properties of the gravitational wave emission from the initial stages of the instability . for",
    "a massive stellar core with @xmath14 and @xmath82 km , the peak amplitude will occur at a frequency of roughly @xmath83hz",
    ". this peak amplitude will be @xmath84 for @xmath38 , and @xmath85 for @xmath63 . here , @xmath86 is the distance to the source in units of 20 mpc .",
    "emission from such unstable cores may be detectable with advanced ground - based interferometers , such as ligo - ii .",
    "an even more optimistic scenario for detectable gravitational radiation occurs if these instabilities arise in supermassive stars polytropic equation of state . ]",
    "for example , if the instability occurs when a supermassive star contracts to the point that @xmath87 , an approximate value for uniformly rotating stars ( baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ) , we estimate the frequency of the gravitational radiation to be @xmath88hz , with amplitude @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath63 .",
    "such signals would be easily detectable by the space - based lisa detector .",
