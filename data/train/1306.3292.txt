    "by controlling the flow of electromagnetic waves to minimize the scattering from an object , the object can be concealed from the wave .",
    "this technology is called `` cloaking '' and is the subject of intense investigation .",
    "the representative cloaking theory assumes an inhomogeneous anisotropic material for the cloaking layer , the physical properties of which are determined by the ordinal coordinate transformation @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretically obtained physical properties can not be realized in conventional materials .",
    "because of the requirement for the material to possess both a permittivity and permeability of less than 1 , this can only be realized in metamaterials .",
    "there have been several experimental and numerical reports that have used metamaterials , for example , as a sprit - ring resonator @xcite , dielectric and metal wire composite @xcite , and cylindrical dielectric @xcite .",
    "another way of cloaking is the cancellation of scattering using plasmonic materials @xcite .",
    "however , since these materials utilize local resonance inside the cloaking region , the propagating wave suffers attenuation due to energy loss . in the case of visible right , this leads to a darkening of the object . to resolve this issue and to achieve easy implementation ,",
    "dielectric non - resonant cloaking has been studied @xcite .",
    "a recent report @xcite shows that non - resonant cloaking can be achieved by multilayered dielectrics . in this type of cloaking ,",
    "increasing the number of layers can be effective for improving the performance .",
    "however , this also increases the number of different kinds of dielectric used , which leads to manufacturing complexity .",
    "numerical optimization techniques are a powerful tool for optimizing the physical properties of materials in the search for cloaking devices @xcite . in the case of isotropic dielectric multilayer cloaking@xcite ,",
    "the physical properties of each layer are determined by an optimization algorithm .",
    "multilayers have been introduced to achieve anisotropy in the cloaking region by using only isotropic materials . from the macroscopic view",
    ", the layered isotropic material can be regarded as a homogenous anisotropic material @xcite .",
    "this approach therefore focuses on the microscopic structure to achieve macroscopic anisotropy .",
    "in contrast , we have taken the opposite approach in the present work to study non - resonant dielectric cloaking .",
    "the macroscopic anisotropic physical properties were first studied by numerical optimization and the microscopic structures required to achieve them were analyzed .",
    "the composites forming each layer were assumed to be made by two kinds of isotropic material .",
    "if the resulting optimized physical properties fall within the range of possible properties the material@xcite , the material can be implemented as an actual composite .",
    "since one layer composed of anisotropic material essentially functioned as a multilayer composed of isotropic materials , effective non - resonant dielectric cloaking is expected to be achieved using fewer layers than in previous studies .",
    "let us consider a 2d cylindrical perfect electric conductor ( pec ) object in an open space , cloaked by the multilayer dielectric as shown in fig .",

    "the dielectric layers are composed of ordinary homogenous isotropic or anisotropic materials .",
    "steady - state full - wave propagation is analyzed in the domain including the cloaking object . to perform the simulation on an open space ,",
    "the domain is surrounded by a perfectly matched layer domain .",
    "we evaluate the scattering from the object against the h - polarized incident wave . the wave propagation in the domain",
    "is dominated by the following maxwell equation in the magnetic form : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the magnetic field vector , relative permittivity tensor , relative permeability tensor and the speed of light .",
    "for an h - polarized incident wave ( @xmath5 where @xmath6 is wave propagation direction vector ) , is solved for the scattering of the magnetic field @xmath7 with the form of @xmath8 .    the anisotropic dielectric that comprises the cloaking layer is assumed to be homogenous and its principal directions are matched to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions of a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath11 surrounding the cloaking object .",
    "the material properties used in the analysis of the h - polarized wave are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the material properties in the ordinal coordinate system are calculated by a coordinate transformation .",
    "assuming that the scattering is evaluated far enough from the object , the cloaking performance is evaluated by the far - field value of the scattered magnetic field .",
    "the far magnetic field is calculated from the near - field according to the stratton ",
    "chu formula @xcite .",
    "the boundary integral is performed on a 2@xmath14 radius circle , the center of which coincides with the center of the cloaked object .",
    "the cloaking performance is evaluated using the scattering width , i.e. the radar cross section per unit length , which is calculated using the far magnetic field @xmath15 : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the distance from the object to the evaluation point .",
    "the physical properties of the cloaking layer that minimize the scattering width are determined by numerical optimization based on a full - wave simulation by the finite element method .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 elements of the relative permittivity are regarded as design variables , which are varied by a gradient approach .     plane .",
    "the anisotropic material properties are set according to the @xmath18 coordinate system . ]      for the anisotropic material used in this study , a composite composed of two isotropic materials is considered . in the design of the composite ,",
    "the bounds of its physical properties must be defined .",
    "wiener arithmetic and harmonic bounds @xcite are introduced , which are formulated as follows : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the relative permittivities of material 1 and 2 , which comprise the composite , and @xmath22 is the volume fraction of material 1 , which has a range @xmath23 .",
