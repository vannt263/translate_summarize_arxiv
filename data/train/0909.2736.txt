    "atomic gas ( ) is presumably the most extended cold component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and is very sensitive to any kind of perturbation .",
    "for instance , the  component in spiral galaxies has long been known to show both geometric and kinematic asymmetries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the hi content is found to be deficient in galaxies in denser environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although asymmetries have also been seen in stellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fact that hi is usually twice more extended than the optical component makes it arguably a better tracer of interaction .",
    "the study of  global velocity profiles of galaxies has proven to be very useful for both the quantification of the hi content as well as the asymmetry level . in the context of the amiga project ,",
    "we use  global velocity profiles of a large sample of strictly isolated galaxies in order to : @xmath1 revise the reference to study the hi content normalcy level in galaxies , @xmath2 quantify the rate of  asymmetries , and @xmath3 study the relevance of different mechanisms producing asymmetries in galaxies , with the additional help of aperture synthesis maps .",
    "we present  data for @xmath4 = 834 cig galaxies ( catalog of isolated galaxies , @xcite ) and study the correlations between the  content and different parameters associated with the stellar component : optical luminosities ( see figure  1 , left ) , diameters and morphological type .",
    "we calculated  fluxes , mean velocities , line - widths and  masses for galaxies we observed at the arecibo , effelsberg , nanay and green bank ( gbt ) radio - telescopes , or compiled from different sources in the literature @xcite .",
    "survival analysis was applied in order to use the information given by upper limits .",
    "this sample is about 3 times larger than that of @xcite , the prevalent reference of hi data for isolated galaxies to date , increasing considerably the population per morphological bin .",
    "this is important especially for the less populated bins , such as e and sd / irr , where our sample has a factor 510 more galaxies .",
    "our improved sample is thus essential as a control sample for studies involving galaxies in denser environments .",
    "we note that to compare the hi content of two different samples , one needs to homogeneously adopt the same constants and corrections , since otherwise the differences may be comparable to the observed levels of deficiency .",
    "the frequency and amplitude of gaseous disk asymmetries have been studied by several authors , with the main conclusion that at least half of the galaxies are asymmetric even in the field .",
    "we restricted our study to a subsample of @xmath4 = 182 galaxies for which we have global  velocity profiles with @xmath5 @xmath6 10 and minimized undesired artificial lopsidedness .",
    "we calculated a flux ratio asymmetry parameter to quantify the asymmetry of the profiles , defined as @xmath7 , if @xmath8 @xmath6 1 , and @xmath9 otherwise , where @xmath8 is the ratio of the areas under the profile at velocities lower and higher than the central velocity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we minimized artificial asymmetries by avoiding large pointing offsets and poor determinations of the central velocity which resulted in possible errors of @xmath10 larger than 10% .",
    "the resulting @xmath10 distribution was characterized by a half - gaussian profile with a fwhm/2 of 0.13 ( figure  [ fig1 ] , right ) .",
    "this width is very likely smaller than 0.13 , since remaining systematic errors were estimated to be @xmath0 7% , mostly produced by pointing offsets and an inaccurate determination of the mean velocity . for large values of the parameters ,",
    "@xmath10 @xmath6 1.3 , we found a total of 16 galaxies .",
    "this corresponds to an excess of 12 more than what would correspond to the fitted half - gaussian profile , or a 6% of the subsample .",
    "this is very likely a residual of interacting systems . among our sample of isolated galaxies",
    "we find a weak trend for larger  asymmetries to be related to less isolated systems .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig2 ] ( left ) the comparison of the distribution of the tidal strength ( @xmath11 ) and galaxy surface number density ( @xmath12 ) parameters ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) for the most symmetric ( @xmath10 @xmath15 1.13 ) and the most asymmetric profiles ( @xmath10 @xmath6 1.13 ) .",
    "smaller @xmath12 and @xmath11 are found for galaxies with symmetric  profiles . in figure  [ fig2 ] ( right )",
    "we show the @xmath10 cumulative probability distribution of previous samples of field / isolated galaxies and compare it with that in our sample .",
    "we found a @xmath0 20% excess of asymmetric profiles in samples of field galaxies or not obviously interacting galaxies .",
    "the only similar distribution to ours is that of haynes et al .",

    "one of the isolated galaxies with an asymmetric profile in this subsample is cig  96 ( ngc  864 ) , whose  synthesis imaging from the vla has been studied in detail in .",
    "the asymmetry in its  profile is associated with a strong kinematical perturbation in the gaseous envelope of the galaxy , where on one side the decay of the rotation curve is faster than keplerian .",
    "although a companion is detected , no tidal tail is found , and it is probably not massive enough to cause such a perturbation .",
    "probably we are witnessing the capture of a gaseous companion .",
    "aperture synthesis maps for the rest of the sources showed more symmetric structures , both in geometry and kinematics .",
    "neither tidal tails nor relevant hi rich companions were found close to any of the galaxies .",
    "the asymmetry was usually found in the kinematics , in the sense that the rotation curve on one side of the galaxy was steeper .",
    "these results are similar to that in other galaxies @xcite , not necessarily isolated . given that in average galaxies in our sample did not likely undergo a major interaction since less than 3  gyr ago , these asymmetries may either be the remnants of a major interaction longer ago , or of a more recent short - lived mechanism such as a minor merger .",
