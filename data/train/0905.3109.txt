    "the standard engineering approach to dealing with interference in wireless systems is to orthogonalize the transmissions and/or treat interference as noise at the receivers .",
    "however , these strategies can be far from optimal in several scenarios , including the classical two user gaussian interference channel  @xcite .",
    "superposition coding and interference alignment have been shown to perform well in interference channels ( where the sources only transmit and destinations only receive ) @xcite .",
    "a potentially more effective approach to interference management is available when the wireless nodes can cooperate among themselves ( this situation is not feasible in the classical interference channel when sources only transmit and destinations only receive ) .",
    "a coarse result ( scaling of symmetric capacity as the number of radios grows ) derived in @xcite shows that distributed cooperation ( a so - called _ hierarchical mimo _ strategy ) can manage interference between the different traffic flows so well as to get near the performance of ( co - located ) mimo operation among the nodes .",
    "while this is a strong result , it is coarse  in the asymptotic regime of a very large number of radios .    our goal in this paper is to better understand the role of cooperation in providing interference management gains .",
    "we study a simple wireless network : we start with the classical two - user gaussian interference channel , but endow the sources with the capability to receive as well as transmit .",
    "this sets up the possibility of cooperation between the sources .",
    "the cooperative links between the sources are over the same frequency band as the rest of the links . in this paper , we treat only the sum - rate under a full - duplex mode of operation . the main result is a characterization of the sum - rate within 20 bits . in specific instances our characterization",
    "is readily sharpened  we provide an example where the gap reduces to 6 bits , for instance .",
    "we also provide recipes to improve the lower and upper bounds .",
    "the two - user gaussian interference channel with destination cooperation where the destinations have receive and transmit capabilities is investigated in a companion paper  @xcite where the sum - capacity is obtained within a constant gap . in section  [ sec : reversibility ] , we present a reversibility property between the two results . as we discuss there , one setting can be viewed as being obtained from the other by ( a ) reversing the roles of sources and destinations and ( b ) changing the directions of the links while preserving the channel coefficients .",
    "we show that the sum - capacities of the two settings connected by this transformation are within a constant gap .",
    "one approach to using the cooperative links is to employ orthogonalization to emulate essentially noise - free bit - pipes between the sources which they can use to conference .",
    "the capacity region of the two - user gaussian interference channels with sources conferencing over orthogonal links has been characterized within a constant gap in  @xcite . however , as we will see , the orthogonalization approach does not lead to an efficient solution for our problem in general .",
    "han and kobayashi  @xcite proposed a coding scheme for the two - user interference channel based on superposition coding of cover  @xcite .",
    "it involves the two destinations partially decoding the interference they receive . in order to facilitate this ,",
    "the sources encode their messages as a superposition of two partial messages .",
    "one of these partial messages , termed the public message , is decoded by the destination where it appears as interference along with the two partial messages which are meant for this destination .",
    "the other partial message , called the private message , from the interfering source is treated as noise .",
    "our coding scheme use two additional types of messages :    * a cooperative - public message which is decoded not only by both the destinations , but also by the other source which aids its own destination in decoding it , and * a cooperative - private message which is decoded by the destination to which it is intended and by the other source which cooperates with the original source in its transmission .",
    "these two messages have similarities to the suggestions of @xcite  works which proposed achievable strategies for the two - user interference channel with generalized feedback .",
    "but they differ in the details of implementation from our scheme in ways which have a bearing on the rates achieved in the gaussian setting .",
    "closely related to the problem of gaussian interference channel with source cooperation is that of gaussian interference channel with feedback . as we discuss in section  [ sec : feedback ] , our coding strategy can be directly employed to obtain the sum - capacity of the two - user symmetric gaussian interference channel with noiseless output feedback within a constant gap of 19 bits .",
    "@xcite independently investigated this problem and obtained a better bound .",
    "other related works include  @xcite which studied the same model , but did not provide a constant - gap result , and @xcite which studied a two - stage , two - source interference network .",
    "also related are the works on the so - called cognitive interference channel  @xcite and interference channel with unidirectional cooperation  @xcite .",

    "_ linear deterministic case._[thm : sourcecoopld ] the sum - capacity of the linear deterministic channel with source cooperation is the minimum of the following : @xmath46    the achievability of the above theorem in proved in appendix  [ app : ldachieve ] , and the upperbounds are derived in appendix  [ app : sourcecoopupperbounds ] .    _",
    "gaussian case._[thm : sourcecoopg ] the sum - capacity of the gaussian channel with source cooperation is at most the minimum of the following five quantities and a sum - rate can be achieved to within a constant ( 20 bits ) of this minimum .",
    "@xmath47    the achievability proof is presented in appendix  [ app : gachieve ] and the converse in appendix  [ app : sourcecoopupperbounds ] .      to illustrate the gains from cooperation , in this section we will explore a specific instance of the symmetric interference channel : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . in appendix",
    "[ app : example ] we prove the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath51 be the minimum of the following @xmath52 for the symmetric channel described above , for any @xmath53 , the sum - capacity lies in @xmath54 , for sufficiently large @xmath55 .",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig : plot ] , as a function of @xmath56 , the sum - rate @xmath51 normalized by the capacity of the direct link , in the limit of @xmath57 while keeping the ratios @xmath58 and @xmath59 constants .",
    "since @xmath51 is achievable within a constant gap ( 6 bits ) , this plot is also that of the sum - capacity in this limit .",
    "this reveals three regimes of operation :    * @xmath60 in this regime , the plot shows that the capacity increases linearly with the strength of the cooperation link ( measured in the db scale ) . for every 3db increase in link strength the sum - capacity increases by 2 bits .",
    "note that without cooperation , the sum - capacity is essentially achieved by time - sharing .",
    "thus , cooperation can be seen to deliver significant gains . * @xmath61 the linear gain saturates when the cooperation link strength is half the direct link strength .",
    "no further gains are accrued until the cooperation link is as strong as the direct link . *",
    "@xmath62 the capacity again increases linearly with the cooperation link strength , but here an increase in capacity by 2 bits requires a 6db increase in the cooperation channel strength .",
    "this linear increase continues until the cooperation capacity is approached when the cooperation link is 3/2 times as strong as the direct link , after which the capacity is flat .",
    "in this section , our cooperative coding scheme is illustrated through a few simple examples .",
    "these examples have been hand - picked so that uncoded ( signal processing ) strategies are enough to achieve the sum - capacity .",
    "however , they cover the key novel aspects of our coding strategy .",
    "in particular , the first example shows how the sources cooperate in conveying cooperative - public messages , which are messages decoded by both sources and which benefit from cooperation .",
    "example  1 also involves the use of private messages which are decoded only by the destinations to which they are intended and get conveyed without the benefits of cooperation .",
    "example  2 shows how cooperative - public messages can occur together with the two types of messages in han - kobayashi s scheme , namely , private messages and public messages ( public messages are decoded by both the destinations and do not benefit from cooperation ) .",
    "example  3 illustrates a second kind of cooperative message : cooperative - private message which benefits from cooperation and is decoded only by the destination which is interested in it .",
    "_ example 1 : _ for the linear deterministic case , let us consider the symmetric channel with direct links @xmath63 , say , and interference links @xmath64 , say , such that @xmath65 .",

    "see figure  [ fig : example1 ] .",
    "the sources transmit @xmath70 note that this is possible because @xmath71 which means that before time @xmath29 , source  1 knows @xmath72 and source  2 knows @xmath73 .",
    "the transmissions are over a long block of length @xmath18 with the signals at time @xmath18 such that @xmath74 . also , we interpret @xmath75",
    ". then , destination  3 receives @xmath76 at the end of time @xmath18 , destination  3 starts reading off the signals backwards starting from what it received at time @xmath18 . from @xmath77",
    "it can recover @xmath78 . making use of the latter two , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath79 , it can recover @xmath80 from @xmath81 .",
    "then , employing its knowledge of @xmath82 , it recovers @xmath83 from @xmath84 , and so on .",
    "thus , destination  3 can recover @xmath85 . by symmetry , destination  4 can also recover its messages .",
    "thus , a rate of @xmath86 can be achieved ( asymptotically as @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus we obtain a sum - rate of 6 which is in fact the sum - capacity of this channel with cooperation .",
    "the above scheme has two kinds of signals :    * private signals : @xmath88 are recovered only by the destination to which it is intended .",
    "note that these signals occupy the lower levels of the transmitted vector such that they do not appear at the destination where they may act as interference . *",
    "cooperative - public signals : @xmath89 .",
    "these signals are read off by the other source at the end of each time @xmath29 and then incorporated into the transmission by both the sources at the time @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the transmission of these signals exploits the possibility of cooperation among the two sources .",
    "destinations perform `` backwards decoding . ''",
    "they recover the cooperative - public signals sent cooperatively starting from the final received vector and proceeding backwards .",
    "hence , the initial transmission used by the sources to convey the signals to each other , being already available , does not act as interference at the destinations . in order to facilitate the recovery of these signals at the sources , they occupy the higher levels of transmitted vector .    _ example 2 : _ let us consider the following asymmetric linear deterministic case , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the capacity as given by theorem  [ thm : sourcecoopld ] is 7 . to achieve this ,",
    "the sources transmit @xmath93 note that this is again possible because @xmath94 and hence , source  1 knows @xmath72 and source  2 knows @xmath73 before time @xmath29 .",
    "the transmissions are again over a long block of length @xmath18 with the signals at time @xmath18 such that at time @xmath18 all the @xmath95 signals are 0 . also , we interpret @xmath96",
    ". then , destination  3 receives @xmath97 and destination  4 receives @xmath98 now it is easy to verify that if the destinations read off the signals starting from the vectors they received at time @xmath18 and proceeding backwards as in the previous examples , destination  3 can recover @xmath99 , and destination  4 @xmath100 , and hence achieve a sum - rate of 7 .",
    "this example involved a new type of signal apart from the private and cooperative - public types of the previous example .    *",
    "public signal : @xmath101 .",
    "this signal is decoded by both the destinations .",
    "however , note that unlike the cooperative - public signal , the other source does not participate in its transmission .",
    "indeed , this signal is transmitted in such a way that it is not visible to the other source .",
    "both the examples above involved cooperative links which are weaker than the direct and interfering links .",
    "the mode of cooperation involved the sources cooperating in aiding the destinations recover an interfering signal .",
    "when the cooperative link is strong , yet another possible form of cooperation becomes feasible .",
    "the next example illustrates this .",
    "_ example 3 : _ let us again consider the symmetric case , but now with @xmath102 .",
    "note that , the cooperation link is now stronger than both the direct and interference links . without cooperation ,",
    "the sum capacity is 5 ; but with cooperation , we will show that a sum rate of 6 can be achieved .",
    "see figure  [ fig : example3 ] .",
    "the sources transmit @xmath103 note that this transmission scheme is possible since @xmath104 .",
    "this allows the sources to exchange their @xmath105 signals one time step in advance over the lowest level .",
    "also , we set @xmath106 , and interpret @xmath107 .",
    "destinations now receive @xmath108 recovery of signals proceeds backwards from the last received vector as in example  1 . assuming that the characteristic of the field @xmath41 is not 2",
    ", destination  3 can recover the signals @xmath109 .",
    "this gives a rate of @xmath110 , and by symmetry a sum - rate of 6 .",
    "in addition to the previously encountered private and cooperative - public types of signals , another kind of signal plays an important role in this example .",
    "the strong cooperation link allows the sources to share with each other signals which are eventually only recovered by the destination it is intended for . _",
    "i.e. , _    * cooperative - private signals : @xmath111 .",
    "the sources learn these signals from each other one time step ahead , and in the next time step they cooperate with each other to convey these signals only to the destination it is intended for .",
    "note that the collaboration between the sources in this example is a rudimentary form of precoding .",
    "the two sources can be thought of as two antennas of a broadcast transmitter when they cooperate to transmit these signals .",
    "only the destination to which the signal is intended for recovers it and the precoding ensures that no interference is caused at the other destination .",
    "the main differences from cooperative - public signals are : ( 1 ) the sources convey the cooperative - private signals to each other through the lowest levels of their transmission vector in such a way that it is not visible to the destinations , whereas the cooperative - public signals are conveyed over the top - most levels of the transmission vector , and ( 2 ) the sources collaborate in sending the cooperative - private signals by precoding the signals to ensure that no interference results at the destinations , while cooperative - public signals are visible to both the destinations which end up recovering them .",
    "thus , while the role of cooperation is to aid both the destinations in recovering the cooperative - public signals , it aims to conceal the cooperative - private from the destination it is not intended for .    in general ,",
    "such uncoded schemes are not sufficient to cover all possible linear deterministic channels ( indeed , even in the above example , we relied on the characteristic of the field not being 2 ) , and more importantly the gaussian channels .",
    "but the basic intuition can be used to build coding schemes which do .",
    "these schemes are presented in detail in the next section .    to roughly see how the intuition extends , consider again example  1 in figure  [ fig : example1 ] .",
    "consider a coding scheme where the transmitted signal from each source is a superposition of three codewords ( as shown in the figure ) .",
    "the codewords encode the two cooperative - public messages from the two sources and the private message of the transmitting source .",
    "as the figure suggests , these codewords have individual `` power allocations '' in the sense that the codeword for the private message has zeros in the top two rows while the codeword for the other source sources cooperative - public message has zeros in the top - most row .",
    "the specific uncoded scheme of the example clearly satisfies these `` power allocations . ''",
    "but we could also consider a coding scheme where the non - zero rows of the codewords carry linear equations on the messages expressed as variables in the field .",
    "as long as the rates at which the message variables are introduced into the linear equations are as in the example , a random coding argument can be invoked to show the existence of such a linear code ( over a large enough extension field , or equivalently over a long enough block of symbols ) which will allow the sources to successfully decode each other s cooperative - public messages and the destinations to successfully decode all the messages . in the next section",
    "we follow this direction and present coding schemes for discrete - memoryless interference channels with source cooperation .",
    "we first present our key coding theorem ( in theorem  [ thm : sourcecoopgenericschemes ] ) .",
    "it is a block - markov ( in the sense of @xcite ) coding scheme which builds on han and kobayashi s classical superposition coding scheme  @xcite for the two - user interference channel and has elements of decode - and - forward strategy  @xcite and backwards - decoding  @xcite for relay channels .",
    "the schemes are generic in the sense that they apply to any memoryless interference channel with source cooperation @xmath112 .",
    "then , we apply these schemes to the problems at hand to obtain the achievability part of theorems  [ thm : sourcecoopld ] and  [ thm : sourcecoopg ] .",
    "we would like to point out that theorem  [ thm : sourcecoopgenericschemes](a ) is identical to the one which appears in  @xcite .",

    "we interpret these theorems in the context of the examples and discussion in the previous section :    scheme ( a ) involves the source nodes aiding their respective destination nodes decode part of the interference ( the cooperative - public message from the interfering source ) by essentially retransmitting the part of the interference observed by the source . in order to facilitate this ,",
    "the cooperative - public message is coded separately ( in @xmath138 and @xmath139 ) which are decoded by the sources and retransmitted ( in @xmath140 ) .",

    "this scheme is closely related to example  1 of the previous section .    in scheme ( b ) , in addition to the above",
    ", the sources collaborate in sending private messages by sharing with each other in advance the part of the message on which they want to collaborate .",
    "thus , the connection is to example  3 of the previous section .",

    "the key difference is that while in scheme ( b ) , the sources perform a joint decoding of all the messages sent by their counterparts ( including the public and private messages which they do not aid in the transmission of ) , in scheme ( a ) , only the part of the cooperative - public message meant to be used for collaboration is decoded while treating all the other messages as noise . at low strengths for the cooperative link , scheme ( a )",
    "can perform better than scheme ( b ) specialized to not include a cooperative - private message . on the other hand , for strong cooperative links , adopting a joint decoding scheme at the sources can lead to better overall rates for other messages .",
    "scheme ( c ) combines these two schemes in a limited manner .",
    "only source node  1 s transmission benefits from transmission of some cooperative - public and some cooperative - private messages while source node  2 s transmission benefits only from collaborative transmission of some cooperative - public message .",
    "source node  1 adopts a decoding strategy similar to that adopted by the sources in scheme ( a ) whereas source node  2 s decoding strategy is similar to the one in scheme ( b ) .",
    "the three schemes ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) can be easily combined into a single scheme ( at the expense of considerably more involved notation ) which may improve the achievable region in general , but since the focus here is on the sum - rate of the gaussian case ( within a constant gap ) and linear deterministic cases which are obtained by considering the schemes separately , we do not explore this here .",
    "intuitively , a source employs a cooperative - private message only when the cooperative link is stronger than the direct link from this source , and the source shares this message with the other source in advance by having it `` ride below '' the other messages it sends .",
    "thus , one of the differences of our scheme from the proposals of  @xcite is that when sharing the cooperative - private message in advance , the decoding source performs a joint decoding of all the messages including those messages it does not aid in the transmission of , rather than treat these other messages as noise . note that in our schemes  ( b ) and ( c ) ,",
    "the sources cooperate in sending the cooperative - private messages by employing a simple form of precoding along the lines of example  3 in the last section .",
    "use of dirty - paper coding  @xcite instead may lead to an improved gap .",
    "the achievability proofs presented in appendix  [ app : ldachieve ] and  [ app : gachieve ] of our main theorems ( theorems  [ thm : sourcecoopld ] and  [ thm : sourcecoopg ] ) make use of these schemes .",
    "a closely related problem is that of the interference channel with feedback .",

    "let us begin by noting that a linear deterministic formulation of the above feedback problem is identical to the one with source cooperation , and hence , theorem  [ thm : sourcecoopld ] applies directly .",
    "turning to the gaussian case , let us note that the achievability proof for the source cooperation case depended only on the marginal distributions of the noises and not on their correlation .",

    "a related setting to the one studied in this paper is the interference channel with destination cooperation .",

    "an interesting _ reversibility _ property connects the two settings .",
