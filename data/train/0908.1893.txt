    "the present work provides a detailed application of a new framework for investigating the confinement of static charges and mass gap in yang - mills theory to the case of gauge group @xmath0 and space - time dimension @xmath2 .",
    "this framework was presented in  @xcite and is based on an exact duality between conventional yang - mills in the lattice regularization and a lattice spin foam model . the case of @xmath0 in three dimensions is particularly attractive as a first testing ground for the general case , as explicit vertex amplitudes are known and possess a particularly tractable form  @xcite . at the same time , this case is rich enough to exhibit in a non - trivial fashion the various features introduced in  @xcite . a previous application of spin foams to the confinement problem for this case",
    "has also been made based on analogy with the dual photon and monopole picture of confinement in @xmath3 theories  @xcite ; the present work also uses the spin foam transformation but proceeds in a different direction .    broadly speaking ,",
    "the results we obtain here can be summarized as follows .",
    "using an exact duality in terms of spin foams we show explicitly from first principles how an area law behavior for the expectation values of wilson loop observables may be obtained in the weak coupling limit . while short of a rigorous proof , we can clearly identify properties that would be required to provide such a proof",
    " they are given as conjectures .",
    "thus , from the perspective of finding a rigorous proof of confinement , what we have done is present a new framework , within which can be formed a reduction of the confinement problem into several `` smaller '' conjectures that are elementary propositions regarding the spin foam model . in doing so , we hope to invite attention to this new perspective that stands apart from many past approaches in offering an understanding of confinement and mass gap that is manifestly gauge - invariant .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall the spin foam expansion of the expectation value of a wilson loop observable . applying the general framework of  @xcite , the worldsheet - background decomposition and interaction factors",
    "are found explicitly . in section 3",
    ", we analyze the interaction factors in more detail , and in particular introduce an asymptotic formula for the vertex interaction @xmath4 that holds in the large spin limit . applying asymptotic estimates for the vertex interaction , we find that for the class of self - avoiding worldsheets , one can show that @xmath5 in the weak coupling limit  a property we shall refer to as `` vertex decoupling '' , a special case of the vertex stability property introduced in  @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we consider different sectors of the full theory according to the framework described in  @xcite . in the case of self - avoiding worldsheets interacting with asymptotic background ,",
    "we show how area - law behavior is particularly transparent due to vertex decoupling .",
    "the remaining sectors of the theory are also discussed and specific properties are identified as necessary conditions for confinement . in section 5",
    "we give formal statements of these required properties in a form suitable for pursuing via analytic methods or through numerical method such as the recently developed non - abelian dual simulation algorithms  @xcite .",
    "section 6 concludes with an assessment of what has been shown and discusses ways in which the results may be strengthened .",
    "we start by introducing the passage from the conventional to spin foam form of lgt , and review the worldsheet - background formulation of the wilson loop observable that was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "as reviewed in  @xcite and references therein , the spin foam transformation of lattice yang - mills theory can be summarized as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the holonomy consisting of a product of group valued variables and their inverses along the edges of @xmath8 . in the present case of @xmath0 and @xmath2",

    "the second line represents the character expansion of the action that has often been used in strong coupling expansions for lattice gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "the final line is based on a lattice spin foam duality , which can be understood as a refinement of the character expansion method ; consistent with the formalism introduced in  @xcite , for a given spin foam @xmath13 the notation @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denotes the set of irrep and intertwiner variables local to a plaquette , edge , and vertex respectively .",
    "a general description of this transformation can be found in  @xcite while details of the transformation for our present case is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the configuration space of the spin foam model is @xmath17 , the set of admissible spin foams  all colorings of the plaquettes and edges by unitary irreps of @xmath18 satisfying certain local constraints .",
    "admissibility constraints are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the edge and vertex amplitudes ( and hence overall amplitude ) to be non - vanishing ; a discussion can be found for example in  @xcite .    to provide a concrete model",
    ", we assume an intertwiner basis has been chosen , in which case the above diagrams become spin network evaluations that can be efficiently computed on the computer , as described in  @xcite . here and throughout we use the character expansion coefficients @xmath19 from the heat kernel action  @xcite .    a commonly used order parameter for confinement ( and the one we shall use in what follows ) is the expectation value of a wilson loop observable .",
    "this expectation value is defined as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes a product of representation matrices @xmath22 in the @xmath23th ( fundamental ) irreducible representation of @xmath18 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the presence of field insertions associated to the wilson loop leads to an expansion in spin foams @xmath24 where the admissibility conditions of spin and intertwiner labels are changed along the wilson line and modified edge and vertex amplitudes and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are to be used .",
    "the barred vertex amplitude has the form given in figure  [ fig:18j_charged ] for edges and vertices in @xmath27 ,        with the vertex amplitude depending on whether the wilson loop enters and leaves in the same direction or makes a perpendicular turn at the vertex . for the barred edge amplitude along @xmath27 , an insertion of a line of half - integer charge modifies the vacuum edge amplitude given in  ( [ eq : edgeampl ] ) . for edges and vertices not in @xmath27 ,",
    "the barred amplitudes are equal to the original unbarred amplitudes . in summary",
    ", we have rewritten the conventional form of the wilson loop expectation value  ( [ eq : wilsonexpect1 ] ) as a ratio of the partition function of two different systems : @xmath28 here we note that @xmath29 is built of up of only vacuum configurations @xmath17 , and @xmath30 is built up of configurations @xmath31 that satisfy modified admissibility conditions ( note that @xmath17 and @xmath31 are disjoint sets ) . since @xmath32 is independent of @xmath27 , the dependence of the expectation value on @xmath27 is controlled by @xmath30 ( a given lattice and fixed @xmath33 ) .    as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "the spin foam transformation offers us a view of the wilson loop expectation value that shares many similarities with the strong coupling expansion but retains its validity in the continuum limit .",
    "we describe this next .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the set of all spin foams admissible in the presence of the given wilson loop @xmath27 ( _ @xmath27-admissible spin foams _ ) , and let @xmath17 denote the set of spin foams admissible in the case of no external charge ; we shall refer to these as _ vacuum admissible spin foams_. finally , let @xmath34 denote the set of spin foams which can be viewed as fundamentally charged ( possibly self - intersecting ) worldsheets ending on @xmath27 ; we shall refer to these as _",

    ".    we shall refer to the @xmath35 in the above as a `` decomposition '' .",
    "defining a decomposition is equivalent to specifying a pair of functions we shall call @xmath43 and @xmath44 that pick out the @xmath17 and @xmath34 components of @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "we should emphasize here that as discussed in  @xcite , there is no unique way of choosing this decomposition . a given decomposition @xmath46 constitutes one ( of many possible ) maps with the desired properties . as discussed in  @xcite , one way of dealing with this degeneracy is to carry out unrestricted sums over @xmath47 , but weight every configuration by a factor accounting for the degeneracy .",
    "this is the strategy we will apply below ; others may be possible .      by making use of the above result",
    ", we can rewrite @xmath30 as a double sum over vacuum admissible spin foams @xmath17 ( which in the present context we shall refer to as `` background '' spin foams ) and the set of @xmath27-connected worldsheets @xmath34 as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 here we have expressed the expectation value of a wilson loop @xmath27 in terms of a double sum : a sum over worldsheets whose boundary is compatible with @xmath27 and a sum over background spin foams ( from the vacuum ensemble ) . because the sum over @xmath34 is unrestricted , the same foam from @xmath31 may come up multiple times : we define this degeneracy to be @xmath50 .",
    "we thus divide by this degeneracy factor to avoid over - counting ; see appendix a of  @xcite for further discussion of degeneracies .",
    "observe that the presence of the worldsheet modifies the background amplitude by a factor that is @xmath51 to the worldsheet .",
    "this factor we shall refer to as the @xmath52 ; it represents the re - weighting of the background amplitude due to the presence of the worldsheet .",

    "this is in the spirit of the original conjecture but a slightly stronger result ( stated in section 5 ) than that of rescaling limits proven to to date . to see this , consider that at any spin scale there are tetrahedra with very long side lengths ( high spin ) which are not the uniform rescaling of any tetrahedra of smaller side lengths .",

    "that approaches zero as @xmath107 . combining the vertex and plaquette interactions",
    "just discussed , let us now consider a general contribution to @xmath113 , the self - avoiding part of @xmath98 : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 denote the sets of plaquettes and vertices ; absolute value lines around finite sets denotes the number of elements . to further resolve the factors that may contribute to or diminish confinement we organized the sum over worldsheets according to their area : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the area ( in number of elementary plaquettes ) of a minimal surface bounding @xmath27 , and",
    "@xmath119 is the restriction of the set @xmath100 to surfaces of area @xmath120 .",
    "we have written ( [ asympalaw ] ) in a way that is particularly transparent with regard to confinement in both the strong and weak coupling limits .",
    "first , we see from the first line of  ( [ asympalaw ] ) that in the @xmath121 coupling limit of @xmath122 , area law behavior will eventually dominate any roughening effects  while the growth in the number of surfaces of a given area is exponential in the area , it is depends only on enumerative geometry and is thus clearly independent of @xmath33 ; conversely , we are free to set @xmath33 arbitrarily small and thus force a tension  this is has long been a standard result in the literature .",
    "by contrast , in the @xmath123 limit we find that the tension provided by the @xmath124 factor decays to zero ( for any fixed @xmath78 ) , and thus can not provide tension to general worldsheets .",
    "the determining factor thus becomes the sum over @xmath60 over the worldsheet surface , as can be seen from the second line of  ( [ asympalaw ] ) .",
    "roughly speaking , if the background spin averaged over any given worldsheet grows faster than @xmath33 ( which divides the sum ) as @xmath123 , than a positive tension bounded away from zero will be present in the weak coupling limit .",
    "this particular means of realizing area damping via the plaquette interaction is presented as a formal conjecture in section 5 .",
    "the set of @xmath27-admissible spin foams contains contributions whose resolution into background and worldsheet require a worldsheet that intersects itself . in general , intersection can happen along vertices , edges , and plaquettes ( or any combination of these ) .",
    "we first consider a self - intersection that occurs at one or more vertices or edges , but not a plaquette .",
    "the important consideration here is that there are a limited number of ways this can happen without also changing a plaquette spin .",
    "indeed , on a three - dimensional cubic lattice only one self - intersection can occur along an edge without increasing any plaquette spins ; similarly for vertices . because this sort of self - intersection will generically lead to @xmath109 in the vertex amplitudes of the intersection , we invoke the vertex decoupling shown above to find that these types of self - intersections do not provide any negative tension in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the remaining cases consist of worldsheets in which a self - intersection occurs at a plaquette . for some range of self - intersection ( @xmath125 ) , the same arguments for the self - avoiding case can be applied . moreover , as @xmath93 gets larger this range will grow as it will take larger perturbations to appreciably change the angles in the asymptotic formula . however , at _ any _ @xmath93 there will be some sufficiently large @xmath78 such that the change in dihedral angles is too great to be within the assumptions of the self - avoiding case .",
    "what is required to deal with these cases is a condition that bounds the growth of @xmath126 for increasing @xmath58 .",
    "one way this could be true ( described in more detail in section 5 ) is if there existed a bound on @xmath126 that grew more slowly than the exponential decay factor that comes from @xmath62 .",
    "if this is the case then the cut - off @xmath93 could be raised until the @xmath78 appearing in the type 1 factor from the @xmath62 were large enough to exceed the bound on @xmath126 , resulting in tension for these sheets .      recall that for given a spin foam @xmath13 , a sub - asymptotic plaquette is one for which @xmath127 , where @xmath93 is a fixed cut - off .",
    "we further define a spin foam to be sub - asymptotic if it contains one or more plaquettes that are sub - asymptotic .",
    "our approach in treating this case will be to find a bound for @xmath99 that is suppressed exponentially in the weak coupling limit .",
    "we start by dividing the sub - asymptotic background spin foams into classes @xmath128 , each element of which is a pair consisting of a subset of the lattice with @xmath129 plaquettes and an associated locally admissible spin foam labelling of those @xmath129 plaquettes by sub - asymptotic spins and edges of these plaquettes by compatible intertwiners .",
    "we next split the sum into asymptotic and sub - asymptotic components , for both background spin foams and worldsheets , as follows : @xmath130 where the set @xmath131 consists of _ asymptotic completions _ of the sub - asymptotic foam @xmath132 : these are assignments of spins to the set of asymptotic plaquettes and edge intertwiners compatible with a given assignment of spins to sub - asymptotic plaquettes and edges , @xmath132 .",
    "given an @xmath132 , we define another set @xmath133 that is the restriction of the set @xmath34 to the sub - asymptotic plaquettes of @xmath132 . finally , for any given @xmath134 and @xmath132 , the set of admissible completions of the worldsheet in asymptotic regions can be formed ; we denote it by @xmath135 .",
    "note that lower dimensional simplices at boundaries ( edges and vertices with both asymptotic and sub - asymptotic incident plaquettes ) between asymptotic and sub - asymptotic regions are defined to be in the sub - asymptotic component .",
    "a considerable obstacle to forming a useful bound on @xmath99 is the fact that @xmath136 can take on negative amplitudes . in particular ,",
    "in forming upper bounds we will be careful not to take absolute values of amplitudes being summed over asymptotic regions of the state space , as quantities of this type can grow exponentially in the volume of the lattice faster than @xmath32 itself ( this manifests itself in numerical simulation as the decay of the sign expectation value ) , where cancellation occurs between positive and negative amplitudes .",
    "in contrast , for sub - asymptotic quantities at a fixed cut - off , we shall see that there arises factors that are bounded by exponential factors in the volume at a rate that is @xmath33 independent .",
    "we will show how they can be suppressed by terms coming from asymptotic factors in the @xmath123 limit . in summary , in proceeding we will take absolute values on sub - asymptotic quantities but not with asymptotic quantities .",

    "this bounding factor certainly does not provide confinement as it has precisely the opposite effect : the weight of worldsheets @xmath134 _ increases _ exponentially with its area .",

    "in section 4 we described scenarios in which area law behavior for asymptotic backgrounds could emerge , and how sub - asymptotic backgrounds are suppressed  both in the weak coupling limit . in this section",
    "we collect together more precise statements of those properties that are sufficient to provide area law behavior , as well as an additional _ balance condition _ , which if true would overcome the technical problems raised by the non - positivity of the spin foam amplitudes .",

    "that is , we start by conjecturing that the growth rate of background spins is of the same or high order as that of @xmath33 itself in the @xmath123 limit .",
    "we then introduce sub - asymptotic suppression to argue that asymptotic background foams are the only ones relevant in the weak coupling limit .",
    "next we take up the question of vertex stability on asymptotic backgrounds , which breaks up into two cases  self - avoiding and self - intersecting worldsheets . in the self - avoiding case , we conjecture that the ponzano - regge asymptotics may be true in a uniform sense , which would ( by the analysis of section 3 ) be sufficient to establish vertex stability in the self - avoiding section ( for all asymptotic spin foams ) . to treat the remaining self - intersecting sheets , we conjecture the existence of a lower bound on the @xmath65 symbol ( outside regions of monotonic decrease in @xmath182 ) that is sub - exponential in @xmath182 ( introduced in section 3 ) .",
    "such a bound would be sufficient to provide vertex stability , as the relevant part of the plaquette interaction decays exponentially in @xmath182 .    given the preceding conjectures , our final conjecture is that the balance condition introduced in  @xcite is true , allowing us to form an area - law upper found on the growth the wilson loop expectation value .      considering both avoiding and self - avoiding sheets , we define the plaquette tension as follows : @xmath183 and apply the definition of area damping from plaquette interaction introduced in  @xcite @xmath184 a(f ) } { \\sum_{f \\in f_{v } } a(f ) } <",

    "however , as @xmath123 , the number of terms in the type 3 factor that could give above unity overall @xmath62 grows without bound due to the weakening of the type 2 factor with inverse @xmath33 .    by elimination",
    ", we conjecture that the type 1 factor is critical to obtaining an area law .",
    "we observe that on backgrounds in which the average spins over any sheet is greater than @xmath33 , the first factor will provide a positive tension to all worldsheets , with self - intersecting ones being suppressed at a rate proportional to their @xmath185 .",
    "as the asymptotic cut - off scale is increased , the slope of the linear growth in @xmath186 in the type 3 factor will insufficient to overcome the tension from factor 1 .",
    "thus for sufficiently large cut - off it is possible for @xmath62 to provide a sub - unity ( positive tension factor ) in the @xmath123 limit for a large class of background spin foams .",
    "thus , as long as backgrounds of this type tend to dominate contributions to the expectation value in the @xmath123 limit , the area damping condition will be met . more succinctly :    as @xmath123 , the set of background spin foams for which the type 1 factor provides a positive tension sufficient to satisfy  ( [ damping_cdtn ] ) dominates the contributions to @xmath187 .",
    "this is simply a more specific form of the general area damping condition given in  @xcite , as it identifies the means by which the defining inequality  ( [ damping_cdtn ] ) is realized .",
    "we remark in passing that this conjecture is well - suited to numerical simulation  the expectation value of the type 1 factor on the vacuum ensemble can be computed using both conventional and dual spin foam algorithms  ( as in  @xcite ) and is the topic of ongoing investigation by the author .",

    "this allows one to analyze the asymptotic case of self - avoiding worldsheets as in section 4.2.1 , culminating in  ( [ asympalaw ] ) , at which point vertex stability ( for that class of worldsheet ) reduces to the area damping conjecture .    as mentioned above ( section  [ sec : largespin ] ) , rigorous derivations of the asymptotic formula in the literature",
    "are presently limited to rescaling limits , where a set of admissible arguments is rescaled .",
    "recent advances in analyzing @xmath65 symbols  @xcite and in particular  @xcite are encouraging  we expect it may be known soon rather the ponzano - regge formula or some generalization thereof can provide a uniform bound that behaves in the way stated .",
    "we should note here the significance of the vertex interaction going to unity ( rather than above or below unity , which would provide negative and positive tension factors ) .",
    "one implication is that for self - avoiding worldsheets on asymptotic backgrounds , confinement must by elimination come from the plaquette interaction .",
    "further , assuming confinement is true , this result can be used as a starting point ( base case ) in showing that the self - intersecting case also has decoupled or at least provides bounded negative tension .",
    "we turn to this case next .      in",
    "@xcite a relatively `` high - level '' definition of vertex stability is given , with the idea that different types of estimates may be needed for models of different gauge groups and dimensionality .",
    "an area averaged tension is defined as @xmath199 this allows comparison of the interaction factor with the `` negative tension '' arising from the exponential growth in surface number , @xmath200 , leading to the condition that @xmath201 a(f ) } { \\sum_{f \\in f_{v}}a(f)},\\ ] ] indicating that @xmath202 is the characteristic inequality . showing that this inequality is satisfied such that the infinum of @xmath203 over all @xmath13 and @xmath120 that are nt suppressed as @xmath123 then defines the condition of vertex stability for a model .    a general approach to establishing",
    "the above is to carry out a local analysis , in the sense that if @xmath204 is above unity over a worldsheet , then some factor of which it is a product must be over unity .",
    "thus , if one considers all admissible arguments to a factor of @xmath204 at a _ single _ vertex and establishes bounds on that quantity for all admissible arguments , one could extend it to a bound over any worldsheet for any asymptotic background .",
    "in our present case we can pursue this local strategy , and moreover exploit the fact that vertex interaction factors are directly related to perturbations of @xmath65 symbols .",
    "the availability of asymptotic estimates then provides a means of realizing the necessary condition , leading us to conjecture    we define _ sub - exponential in @xmath78 _ to mean that @xmath205 for any @xmath206 ; the @xmath78 can be any collection of the @xmath78 arguments appearing in  ( [ 6j_args ] ) . for all possible admissible arguments where @xmath126 is non - zero , one of the two",
    "is true :    1 .",
    "monotonic decreasing with @xmath78 or 2 .",
    "@xmath204 is sub - exponential in @xmath78 .",
    "the expectation behind this conjecture is that in the euclidean regime where the @xmath65 asymptotic is characteristically oscillatory ( multiplied an effective power law volume factor ) there will exist some sub - exponential bound away from zero .",
    "this will in turn limit the rate at which displacements of @xmath78 can lead to growth relative to undisplaced @xmath65 symbol ; if so , then the exponential damping from the type 1 plaquette factor will be able to attenuate worldsheets with arbitrarily high levels of self - intersection .",
    "in the non - euclidean cases where the @xmath65 may exhibit exponential decay in the sum over @xmath207 , large displacements of the @xmath65 factors in @xmath208 will be less than unity if @xmath65 is monotonic decreasing .",
    "monotonic decay when increasing single arguments or some subset of the arguments has ( to the author s knowledge ) not yet been rigorously shown , but is well - supported by numerical testing by the author and in the literature .",
    "as emphasized in  @xcite , the amplitude @xmath136 is in general non - negative for dual spin foam models of yang - mills theories and that is certainly true of the present case ; this raises some considerable technical complications in forming an upper bound .",
    "we next make the following conjecture :    _ the interaction factor for any given worldsheet @xmath59 , averaged over negative amplitude states @xmath209 approaches its average over positive amplitude states @xmath210 as @xmath123_.    what this allows us to do is take either the positive or negative weight background spin foams to estimate the wilson loop expectation value . taking the positive weight configurations : @xmath211 where the bounding tension is defined as @xmath212 $ ] .",
    "the term @xmath213 represents contributions where the existence of a bounding tension does not hold , but which can be shown to go to zero in the @xmath123 limit .",
    "an alternative to the balance condition is to conjecture that there is a subset of @xmath214 of stationary phase which dominates the partition function in the continuum limit . in this case , assuming numerator of the expectation value ( as a sum of @xmath136 weighted by the worldsheet observable ) is also dominated by configurations from @xmath214 , then we can use positivity on the set @xmath214 to form a similar bound .",
    "the availability of asymptotic estimates for @xmath215 combined with the suppression of sub - asymptotic configurations may render a stationary phase tractable , and is the subject of ongoing work by the author .",
    "the conjecture  ( [ final_bound ] ) provides a presentation of the expectation value for a single fixed wilson loop @xmath27 as a decaying exponential sum over classes of worldsheets of increasing area . to consider confinement",
    ", one must consider the behavior across a range of wilson loops corresponding to increasing spatial separation ( and thus increased area ) of quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , one way to provide this is to define @xmath216.\\ ] ] the ( leading order ) of each world - sheet area expansion of @xmath97 can thus be bounded by a function proportional to @xmath217 , thus yielding the area - law decay characteristic of a confining theory .",
    "it should be noted that such a bound does not ( by itself ) rule out local variations in the expectation value that may fluctuate within the exponentially decaying envelope .",
    "we mention in passing how a similar analysis could be applied to the mass gap observable ( 2-point correlation function ) , and in principle higher order correlation functions .",
    "as discussed in appendix b of  @xcite , the main point of departure is that the topology of worldsheets is different  the background foams are unchanged however the worldsheets terminate on two fundamental plaquettes rather than single loop @xmath27 . as a result , the rate of growth with increasing area may expected to differ somewhat , as would the effective tension of a given area class .",
    "as described in  @xcite , a wilson loop expectation value in conventional lattice gauge theory can be expressed as the expectation value of a certain type of observable on the vacuum spin foam state sum .",
    "this observable is a sum of interaction factors  one for each worldsheet bounding @xmath27 ( modulo a degeneracy factor ) .",
    "each interaction factor is manifestly a product of factors over plaquettes and vertices of the worldsheet . due to the factorization of amplitudes over worldsheets and the ability to organize worldsheets by increasing area",
    ", this spin foam formalism is particularly well - suited for identifying the absence or presence of area law decay . in the present paper",
    ", we introduced the interaction factors associated to the choices @xmath0 and space - time dimension @xmath2 specifically and described methods for understanding their behavior in different sectors : sub - asymptotic , asymptotic with self - intersecting worldsheets , and asymptotic with self - avoiding worldsheets .",
    "the resulting analysis shares a number of similarities with the study of lattice gauge theory through strong coupling diagrams in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "the weak coupling case considered here however requires _ a priori _ consideration of all vacuum spin foam backgrounds as well as all worldsheets bounding @xmath27 , including those with arbitrary amounts of self - intersection .",
    "by contrast , the theory at strong coupling depends on a much more restricted class of diagrams .",
    "the scenario analyzed here follows the general ansatz described in  @xcite , where background foams that dominate the weak coupling limit provide tension to worldsheets through plaquette interaction factors . in order for this scenario to hold true , the _ stability of vertex interaction _ property needs to be shown .",
    "a remarkable result of the present work is that vertex stability for _ self - avoiding _ worldsheets follows immediately from a well - known asymptotic formula for @xmath65 symbols , of which the vertex interaction is a ratio of products . for worldsheets of arbitrary self - intersection ,",
    "we explain how the vertex interaction factor ( and thus , the @xmath65 symbols that comprise it ) can be bounded in such a way that the plaquette interaction can still provide a tension .",
    "we further show that subject to a conjecture on the relative growth rate of restricted sums relative to the full partition function , backgrounds with sub - asymptotic spins ( below a given cut - off ) can be ignored in the weak coupling limit .",
    "this allows the remaining conjectures to be described in terms of the asymptotic form of the vertex amplitudes , which should be susceptible to a variety of analytic methods .    despite the above results , the picture currently presented by this approach is incomplete in several respects .",
    "the behavior of local amplitudes critical for vertex stability involves several properties relating to the asymptotic behavior of @xmath65 symbols which , while suggested anecdotally by numerical experiment , remains to be proven rigorously for all admissible values . at the level of the statistics of the model",
    ", the growth rate of background spins relative to @xmath33 remains to be shown .",
    "further statistical results are also require to assess the growth rate of restricted relative to unrestricted partition functions , the essential ingredient of sub - asymptotic suppression .",
    "finally , the presence of alternating signs continues to cloud the picture , and it will be interesting to see if stationary phase methods may shed light on this difficulty .    in summary ,",
    "the present work gives a working example of how spin foams can be used to arrive at a gauge - invariant understanding of confinement at weak coupling similar in concept to the standard proof of confinement at strong coupling . to provide a concrete scenario for confinement , a number of specific properties of the spin foam model with varying levels of heuristic and numerical support were conjectured which taken together are sufficient for an area law bound .",
    "we hasten to add that there could be a number of alternative realizations should one of these conjectures fail  nonetheless , we expect that the general framework we have illustrated will increasingly constrain the behavior local amplitudes and statistical behavior of the model as more results ( both negative and positive ) are obtained , to the point where alternative possibilities can be systematically explored .",
    "we do hope the results obtained thus far are sufficient to spark further progress on the conjectures given here as well as motivate similar investigations in four dimensions and for @xmath218 .",
    "the author would like to thank dan christensen , florian conrady , and igor khavkine for valuable discussions that influenced this work .",
    "* ( absolute convergence of @xmath219 ) .",
    "* the partition function @xmath220 , in which every the absolute value of every summand in the original partition function is summed , exists for any ( finite ) lattice @xmath42 .",
    "the racah - wigner @xmath65 symbols used in the present work are bounded by unity , shown in  @xcite for example .",
    "therefore we can write : @xmath221 in the final step we replace a sum of products by a product of sums . each sum in the product can in turn be bounded by an integral , whose existence is guaranteed by the finiteness of integrating a polynomial against a gaussian on @xmath222 @xmath223 where @xmath224 are the number of plaquettes ( polygonal faces ) in the 2-complex @xmath42 .",
    "the proof goes through essentially without change in the case of the charged partition function , except in this case both @xmath65 symbols and modified @xmath65 symbols that arise in vertex amplitudes along @xmath27 ( see  @xcite ) have to be shown to be bounded from above .",
    "the modified @xmath65 is a special case of a unitary evaluation of an @xmath18 spin network ( without loops or trivial components ) , and thus a constant upper bound is provided by the work of abdesselam  @xcite , which follows on a conjecture given in  @xcite by garoufalidis and van der veen ."
