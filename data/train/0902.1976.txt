    "gabriel f. calvo and antonio picn @xcite introduced a class of operators which allows arbitrary manipulations of the three lowest - order hermite - gaussian ( hg ) modes for the purposes of quantum communication . in our previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we ( 1 ) classified the self - adjoint extensions of the generators and ( 2 ) showed how to construct semiclassical approximations of the associated unitary operators ; for the latter , we first considered a simple model operator to illustrate the semiclassical methods in a simplified setting before then moving on to the full operators of calvo and picn .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the simplified operator also serves as a model operator from an experimental viewpoint , when considered as manipulating laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes of orders @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "calvo and picn introduced the following eight generators acting on hermite - gaussian modes : @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9,\\ ] ] defined in terms of the creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and similarly for the @xmath12-variable .",
    "these generators , within the subspace generated by the lowest three hermite - gaussian modes @xmath13 , obey the @xmath14 algebra @xmath15=if_{abc}{\\hat{\\mathcal{t}}}_{c}\\ ] ] ( @xmath16 ) , where the only nonvanishing ( up to permutations ) structure constants @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 we note that the triad of generators @xmath19 gives a @xmath20 group that conserves the mode order .",
    "the remaining two @xmath20 groups are formed by the triads @xmath21 unitary operators @xmath22 generated by the first triad give rise to superpositions between the two modes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , leaving invariant the fundamental mode @xmath25 .",
    "unitarities @xmath26 and @xmath27 , generated by the second and third triads , produce superpositions between the two modes @xmath25 and @xmath23 ( leaving invariant @xmath24 ) , or the modes @xmath25 and @xmath24 ( leaving invariant @xmath23 ) , respectively .    here",
    "we instead consider the one - dimensional operator @xmath28 acting on the one - dimensional hermite functions @xmath29 .",
    "this is a simplified version of the operator @xmath30 above .",
    "we introduced this operator in @xcite since it exhibits the same essential behavior as @xmath30 , while leaving out the unessential additional variables . here",
    "we will show that this operator may also be useful in experimental work , as an easier preliminary step before moving to the more complicated operator @xmath30 .",
    "one may check that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "more generally , @xmath33 where @xmath34 so @xmath35 , when acting on the domain of ( finite ) linear combinations of hg modes , behaves precisely as the infinite jacobi matrix @xmath36 using a theorem from berezanskii s book ( @xcite , p.507 ; see also @xcite ) , one can show that the deficiency index of this operator is @xmath3 , and hence the space of boundary values is of dimension @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , using results of allahverdiev @xcite , one can explicitly classify all self - adjoint extensions in terms of certain boundary values at infinity .",
    "this was achieved for the full operators of calvo and picn in @xcite , using a slight modification of allahverdiev s methods , but for the simplified operator @xmath35 the methods of allahverdiev may be applied without any modification .    we will show that this model operator @xmath35 allows simple manipulations of lg modes . but",
    "first , since the wigner transform plays a basic role in the theory of lg modes , we recall some relevant facts in the next section .",
    "the standard @xmath38-dimensional semiclassical wigner transform is defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are square - integrable functions of @xmath38 variables .",
    "then , among other useful properties ( one may consult folland s book @xcite ) , we have the norm - preserving property : @xmath42 also , the wigner transform has an important relationship with weyl quantization .",
    "we recall that the semiclassical weyl quantization of a symbol @xmath43 is the operator @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 then @xmath46 as discussed in the previous paper @xcite , we have an approximate formula for the evolution of the wigner transform",
    ". let @xmath47 be a self - adjoint semiclassical pseudodifferential operator with hamilton flow @xmath48 generated by the ( possibly @xmath49-dependent ) weyl symbol , and let @xmath50 be the unitary propagator .",
    "( note : in the previous paper , @xmath51 sometimes denoted the semiclassical _ approximate _ unitary propagator . )",
    "we then have @xmath52 this essentially follows from egorov s theorem with an @xmath53 error ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the previous paper , we briefly discussed two - dimensional wigner transforms . in the present paper , in the next section , we will consider the case @xmath54 , since lg modes are themselves one - dimensional wigner transforms of hermite functions @xcite .",
    "in the context of lg modes , it is more convenient to use an alternative definition of the wigner transform .",
    "we define the ( one - dimensional ) _ extended _ wigner transform , of a function @xmath55 of two variables , as @xmath56 ( the sign of the phase is intentionally different from ( [ e : wigstd ] ) . )",
    "this is clearly a unitary operator ; moreover , as shown in @xcite , the @xmath57 lg mode is precisely given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the @xmath57 hg mode .",
    "for reference , we will now state the main facts in the semiclassical setting .",
    "the zeroth order hg mode is the gaussian function @xmath60 all other hg modes , @xmath59 , may be recovered by applying the creation operators @xmath61 that is , @xmath62 the corresponding annihilation operators are @xmath63    alternatively , to recover the lg modes , one applies to @xmath64 the creation operators @xmath65 the corresponding lg mode annihilation operators are @xmath66    as discussed in @xcite ( but also as one may easily check ) , the extended wigner transform intertwines the two classes of creation and annihilation operators : @xmath67    since @xmath68 , this shows that the lg modes are indeed the extended wigner transforms of the hg modes .",
    "moreover , one may deduce the following familiar analytic expressions for the lg modes .",
    "suppose @xmath69 , and let @xmath70 .",
    "then , with @xmath71 denoting the @xmath72 hg mode , the @xmath72 lg mode is @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "of particular importance in this paper are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we first consider the action of the tensor product @xmath77 on tensor products of functions : @xmath78 then we simply pull back this action to operate on extended wigner transforms of functions .",
    "we write this as follows : @xmath79 since the extended wigner transform has the intertwining property ( [ e : intertwine ] ) , we see that the pullback operator @xmath80 is precisely the differential operator @xmath81 however , this point of view only seems to complicate matters .",
    "we are especially interested in the case when @xmath82 , the @xmath57 hg mode ; then the pullback @xmath80 acts on lg modes . in particular , @xmath77 acts on the four `` binary '' hg modes as follows : @xmath83 hence @xmath84    these lowest - order lg modes may be written in polar coordinates as @xmath85 so we see that the pullback @xmath80 interchanges the lg modes @xmath86 and @xmath87 and simply causes a phase reversal in the lg modes of order one .    for convenience , in order to have a semiclassical differential operator , we define @xmath88 and we note that with weyl symbol @xmath89 , which is not quite the same as @xmath47 .",
    "however , it was merely given as an example , to illustrate a general method , so in that paper one may simply redefine the operator in the first place . ]",
    "@xmath90 with the notation @xmath91 .",
    "just as we defined the pullback of @xmath35 , we may similarly define the pullback of the unitary propagator @xmath50 : @xmath92 one may check that @xmath51 acts as follows : @xmath93 hence we have @xmath94,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in polar coordinates , @xmath95 this transformation is pictured in figure [ f : finalninelg ] .",
    "as mentioned in section [ s : scwig ] , we have an approximate formula for the evolution of the wigner transform in terms of the hamilton flow . at the end of this paper , we will adapt the result to the case of the extended wigner transform , for the study of lg mode intensities ; but first we will explicitly compute the hamilton flow .",
    "the weyl symbol of @xmath47 is @xmath96 later we will need a re - scaled version of @xmath97 , so we consider the slightly more general symbol @xmath98 hamilton s equations for this symbol are @xmath99 with the conserved quantity @xmath100    first suppose that @xmath101",
    ". then we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 is either an arbitrary real constant or an arbitrary real constant plus @xmath104 , the purely imaginary half - period of @xmath105 . here",
    "@xmath105 is the weierstrass @xmath105-function associated to the invariants @xmath106 for further details , one may consult our previous paper @xcite .",
    "when @xmath107 and @xmath101 , @xmath108 is always strictly decreasing , which follows simply from hamilton s equations ( [ e : hameqp0 ] ) .",
    "however , when @xmath109 we have a more complicated behavior , as shown in figure [ f : hflow ] .",
    "there is a pocket of radius @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is in practice the radius of the laser beam s waist .",
    "since the lg modes are extended wigner transforms of hg modes , we now see that the intensity of lg modes evolves according to the hamilton flow we have just computed . as discussed in section  [ s : scwig ] , we have that the evolution of the wigner transform may be approximately described by the hamilton flow @xmath48 .",
    "however , the extended wigner transform acts slightly differently with respect to the weyl quantization : @xmath119 even so , the same arguments give the same result , up to some minor re - scaling .",
    "let @xmath120 be the operator given by @xmath121 then we have @xmath122 here @xmath123 which we note is the hamilton flow of the function @xmath124 up to a re - scaling of @xmath125 , we then have the hamilton flow computed earlier , but now in the case @xmath126 .",
    "hence the intensities of the lg modes evolve along elliptic curves , as pictured in figure  [ f : hflow ] .",
    "this was in fact the motivation for the present paper .",
    "previously , in @xcite , we found that the wigner transforms of hg modes evolve , in four - dimensional phase space @xmath133 , according to a slightly more complicated flow , where the flow in the @xmath134 plane ( with @xmath135 and @xmath136 dual variables ) for certain values of @xmath137 appears as in figure  [ f : hflow ] .",
    "now we have found a situation where the flow along elliptic curves appears in the physical @xmath138 plane .",
    "if one wishes , one may then consider wigner transforms of lg modes ; formulas for these are given in @xcite ."
