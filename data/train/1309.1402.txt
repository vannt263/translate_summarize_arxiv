    "the continuum path integral or canonical hamiltonian quantization of gauge theories require the choice of a gauge fixing condition .",
    "this is perfectly well understood in the abelian case , but in the non - abelian case the nontrivial topology of the gauge group can spoil the simple picking up of a unique gauge field per set of gauge equivalent fields that fulfills the gauge condition .",
    "this problem was first investigated by gribov in @xcite for the landau and coulomb gauges , and later on many nontrivial results were more rigorously probed in the work of zwanziger , dellantonio and others @xcite .",
    "also in curved spaces , some results were booked in more recent times @xcite .    in a series of papers , we and others investigated the dynamical stability and further quantum alterations to the seminal results of gribov and zwanziger @xcite .",
    "the ensuing propagators of the gauge bosons ( gluons ) and faddeev - popov ghosts are in good agreement with their lattice counterparts @xcite . the gribov ",
    "zwanziger approach is thus one example of effective functional approaches to non - abelian gauge fixed theories , thereby supplementing other potential approaches as in @xcite .",
    "the propagators proposed by us recently also found use in studies of casimir effect @xcite or the finite temperature phase diagram @xcite .",
    "a key observation of the nonperturbative landau gauge gluon propagator is the violation of positivity , that is the gluon is not a particle that has a physical interpretation with associated klln - lehmann spectral integral representation with positive density .",
    "this violation of positivity is well - appreciated from simulational and analytical approaches @xcite , and it can be seen as a signal of confinement : gluons can not be observed . in the gribov ",
    "zwanziger approach , this violation of positivity annex unphysicalness of the gluon is imminent because of the presence of complex conjugate poles in the propagator @xcite .",
    "this led us to the interesting question what the consequences would be of the gauge fixing ambiguity and its gribov - zwanziger resolution when the gauge theory is coupled to a higgs sector , most notably in the case of a @xmath0 theory with fundamental higgs matter , of physical relevance to the electroweak sector of the standard model . at the energies at which the electroweak theory is probed , a valid perturbation theory with a set of 3 observable massive gauge bosons and a massless photon should be the outcome .",
    "complex conjugate masses or a positivity violation in the gauge boson sector should thus preferably not manifest themselves .",
    "of course , the gribov problem is still there , irrespective whether higgs field are present or whether the higgs mechanism takes place .",
    "the issue of having multiple solutions to the gauge fixing condition is a classical observation , only influenced by having a non - abelian gauge field structure .",
    "we would thus rather like to find out under which circumstances treating the gribov copy problem becomes trivial at the quantum level , thereby not affecting the standard perturbative expansion and accompanying results on the spectrum etc .",
    "the difference or not between a confining and higgs - like spectrum of gauge - higgs system is a very deep question , most notable brought to attention in the seminal theoretical lattice work of fradkin and shenker @xcite .",
    "they presented evidence , using either an area or perimeter law for the wilson loop expectation value to label the confining and higgs phase , that both regions are analytically connected in a ( gauge coupling , higgs @xmath1 ) diagram . from lattice works as @xcite",
    ", one also learns that the 2 regions are separated by a line corresponding to a 1st order phase transition , whereby it is crucial to mention that this line has an end - point .",
    "the spectrum is in both phases generated from gauge invariant operators that `` interpolate '' analytically between massive gauge bosons , resp .",
    "mesonlike bound states in the higgs , resp .",
    "confining phase , see for example also @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a more detailed exposure on this .",
    "in this section we define the notation and conventions used throughout the paper .",
    "the system we study is the electroweak sector of the @xmath2 standard model , thereby generalizing our earlier works @xcite . in the following sections we consider in detail the possible effects of gribov copies in such a setting , based on the original gribov no - pole analysis @xcite .",
    "a summary of our results can be found in section 6 .",
    "let us begin by recalling the action describing a higgs field in the fundamental representation of @xmath3 : @xmath4 with covariant derivative @xmath5 and the vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) of the higgs field @xmath6 the indices @xmath7 refer to the fundamental representation of @xmath3 , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , are the pauli matrices .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the groups @xmath3 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "it will be understood that we work in the limit @xmath13 for simplicity , i.e.  we have a higgs field frozen at its vacuum expectation value , as in @xcite and as in our previous works . in principle , in the continuum , such limit should only be taken after the feynman diagrams up to a certain order have been computed and properly renormalized , since otherwise problems with the uv renormalization can be expected . in this work , as in its predecessors @xcite , we shall however only need a one loop computation for the ghost propagator ( see further ) and at this order , there are no contributions proportional to @xmath14 yet , so the limit @xmath13 is well under control for the time being . in any case , the aim of the current paper is still not that of being exhaustive on the gribov / higgs issue , given the mere complexity of it .",
    "the to be presented results should be interpreted as a first step towards a better understanding of the gauge fixing ambiguity in gauge theories supplemented with higgs matter fields .",

    "it is well known since the pioneering paper @xcite that imposing the landau gauge fixing does not completely fix the gauge freedom . indeed , since an infinitesimal gauge transformation corresponds to a shift of the gauge fields with the covariant derivative of some function , a solution gauge equivalent to the landau gauge with infinitesimal gauge transformation is possible whenever the faddeev ",

    "this is not a surprise , since after all the landau gauge is an extremal case of the well - known @xmath40 gauges which have the explicit property of killing the mixing terms between the gauge bosons and goldstones .",
    "the diagrammatic expansion of the here studied @xmath0 theory should thus be well under control .",
    "we do however wish to remark that the issue of unitarity of gauge theories with massive vector particles due to a higgs mechanism , is ideally not discussed in the landau gauge , mainly because of the constraint issues related to setting @xmath41 with the help of a lagrangian multiplier @xmath42 .",
    "other gauges are better suited for this , in particular the well - known unitary gauge . on the other hand",
    ", this gauge might provide with nice physical interpretation at the classical level , it is evenly well - known that the uv renormalization of the unitary gauge is badly behaved , to say the least . in this work , we thus specifically choose the landau gauge , since it is the only covariant gauge in which relatively a lot is known about the gribov gauge fixing ambiguity , while being a well - defined gauge at the quantum level for carrying out loop computations .",
    "in addition , it also has the advantage of being under scrutiny using lattice simulational tools , see @xcite , allowing a comparison between different methodologies . in theory ,",
    "if unitarity is established in one gauge , gauge invariance dictates it is valid in any gauge . at the quantum level",
    ", the unitarity is always better discussed using brst tools anyhow @xcite .",
    "we will not dwell upon that here .    to restrict to the first gribov region @xmath30 at lowest nonvanishing order , we can compute the two - point ghost function and impose a no - pole condition for the latter quantity .",
    "indeed , the ghost propagator is nothing but the inverse of the faddeev  popov operator .",
    "the tree level ghost propagator reads @xmath43 and is thus positive . if the perturbative corrections get too large",
    " which we typically expect in strongly interacting gauge theories to happen at lower momentum transfer  the quantum shift in the ghost self - energy could overcome the tree level value .",
    "in other words , the ghost propagator would turn negative , indicating that we are outside of the region @xmath30 , defined by the ghost propagator being positive .",
    "in order to impose the no - pole condition on the su(2 ) ghost propagator , we first need a closed expression for it . the two - point ghost correlation function is @xmath44 \\label{ghprop}\\ ] ] which can be written in matrix - form as @xmath45 here we defined the off - diagonal two - point function    @xmath46 \\label{gh off}\\ ] ]    and the diagonal one @xmath47\\;. \\label{gh diag}\\ ] ]    thus @xmath48 the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 turn out to be decreasing functions of @xmath51 , explicitly visible upon taking the average with a suitable measure , see also @xcite .",

    "this decoupling can be easily seen just by setting @xmath88 in the propagator expressions and :    [ propgzro ] @xmath89    also , as in the last section , one should be able to write the propagators in terms of the fields @xmath77 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 obtaining    [ ppgzro ] @xmath90    these propagators , and , could also be derived by taking @xmath88 in the quadratic partition function , or even in the generating function , and following the steps of the last section .",
    "looking at the above propagators , beside the decoupling of the @xmath12 gauge field from the @xmath3 gauge field , one should note the likeness between the diagonal and off - diagonal propagators , though in general the two gribov parameters , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , differ .",
    "therefore , given the important role played by the gap equations , it seems to be worth to analyze the two gap equations in the limit @xmath93 . in this limit ,",
    "the gap equations become @xmath94 it is clear that these two equations are identical . thus ,",
    "when @xmath87 , there is only one gap equation and , therefore , only one gribov parameter .",
    "consequently , the diagonal and off - diagonal propagators of are identical .",
    "these results coincide with what was found in @xcite in the case of higgs field in the fundamental representation .",
    "furthermore , from equation , we get for the vacuum energy , @xmath95 which , again , is in agreement with the expression for the vacuum energy for the case of @xmath3 in the fundamental representation , upon redefining @xmath96 .",
    "before trying to solve the gap equations , it seems to be worthwhile to study what happens with @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the absence of the gribov parameters , which will allow us to search for regions where the gribov parameters @xmath84 and @xmath24 are unnecessary , which happens whenever @xmath97 and/or @xmath98 are less than one .",
    "thus , given and the propagators we have @xmath99 using standard techniques , this gives @xmath100 where @xmath101 such that the off - diagonal ghost form factor can be rewritten as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the weinberg angle . with the 2nd expression of and we are able to identify three possible regions :    * region i , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 , meaning @xmath106 . in this case the gribov parameters are both zero so that we have the massive @xmath77 and @xmath36 , and a massless photon , as in , in what we can call the higgs phase . * region ii , where @xmath107 and @xmath105 , or equivalently @xmath108 . in this region",
    "we have @xmath109 while @xmath110 , leading to a modified @xmath77 propagator , and a free photon and a massive @xmath36 boson . * the remaining parts of parameter space , where @xmath107 and @xmath111 , or @xmath112 . in this regime",
    "we have both @xmath110 and @xmath113 , which modifies the @xmath77 , @xmath36 and photon propagators , as shown in equations .",
    "furthermore this region will fall apart in two separate regions iii and iv due to different behavior of the propagators .",
    "let us first look at the behavior of the off - diagonal bosons under the influence of the gribov horizon .",
    "the propagator only contains the @xmath24 gribov parameter , meaning @xmath84 does not need be considered here .    as found in the previous section ,",
    "this @xmath24 is not necessary in the regime @xmath114 , due to the ghost form factor @xmath115 always being smaller than one . in this case , the off - diagonal boson propagator is simply of the massive type : @xmath116    in the case that @xmath117 , the relevant ghost form factor is not automatically smaller than one anymore , and the gribov parameter @xmath24 becomes necessary .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is given by the gap equations , which has exactly the same form as in the case without electromagnetic sector .",
    "therefore the results will also be analogous . as the analysis is quite involved",
    ", we just quote the results here .",
    "for @xmath118 the off - diagonal boson field has two real massive poles in its two - point function .",
    "one of these has a negative residue , however .",
    "this means we find one physical massive excitation , and one unphysical mode in this regime .",
    "when @xmath119 the two poles acquire a nonzero imaginary part and there are no poles with real mass - squared left . in this region",
    "the off - diagonal boson propagator is of gribov type , and the @xmath120 boson is completely removed from the spectrum .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the two other gauge bosons  the diagonal su(2 ) boson and the photon  have their propagators given by , , and or equivalently  the @xmath121 and the @xmath122  by , and . here",
    ", @xmath84 is the only of the two gribov parameters present .    in the regime @xmath123 ,",
    "@xmath84 is not necessary to restrict the region of integration to @xmath30 . due to this , the propagators are unmodified in comparison to the perturbative case : @xmath124    in the region @xmath125 the gribov parameter @xmath84 does become necessary , and it has to be computed by solving its gap equation . due to its complexity it seems impossible to do so analytically .",
    "therefore we turn to numerical methods . using mathematica",
    "the gap equation can be straighforwardly solved for a list of values for the couplings . in order to do this ,",
    "we regularize the momentum integration by subtracting a term designed to cancel the large-@xmath126 divergence ( as in the pauli ",
    "villars procedure ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is an arbitrary mass scale .",
    "the second integral is readily computed by hand , whereas the first one converges and can be determined numerically .",
    "once the @xmath84 parameter has been determined , we look at the propagators to investigate the nature of the spectrum .",
    "the denominators of the propagators are a polynomial which is of third order in @xmath126 .",
    "there are two cases : there is a small region in parameter space where the polynomial has three real roots , and for all other values of the couplings there are one real and two complex conjugate roots . in  [ regionsdiag ]",
    "these zones are labeled iii and iv respectively .    just as in @xcite",
    "we can decompose the propagator matrix @xmath129 ( were @xmath130 and @xmath131 run over the fields @xmath132 and @xmath33 ) as @xmath133 the vectors @xmath134 can be interpreted as linear combinations of the @xmath135 and @xmath72 fields .",
    "decomposing the two - point functions in this way , we thus find three `` states '' @xmath136 .",
    "these states are not orthogonal to each other ( which would be impossible for three vectors in two dimensions ) . the coefficients in front of the yukawa propagators will be the residues of the poles , and they have to be positive for a pole to correspond to a physical excitation . from the analysis in @xcite it also follows that @xmath137 will always be positive if the mass squared is real , which helps to determine the sign of the residue without having to explicitly compute it .",
    "the same results can also be attained by introducing `` generalized @xmath130-particles '' , as done in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    as the model under consideration depends on three dimensionless parameters ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath138 )",
    ", it is not possible to plot the parameter dependence of these masses in a visually comprehensible way .",
    "therefore we limit ourselves to discussing the behavior we observed .    in region iii ,",
    "when there are three real poles in the full two - point function , it turns out that only the two of the three roots we identified have a positive residue and can correspond to physical states , being the one with highest and the one with lowest mass squared .",
    "the third one , the root of intermediate value , has negative residue and thus belongs to some negative - norm state , which can not be physical .",
    "all three states have nonzero mass for nonzero values of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath11 , with the lightest of the states becoming massless in the limit @xmath139 . in this limit",
    "we recover the behavior found in this regime in the pure @xmath3 case @xcite ( the @xmath36-boson field having one physical and one negative - norm pole in the propagator ) with a massless boson decoupled from the non - abelian sector .    in region",
    "iv there is only one state with real mass squared  the other two having complex mass squared , conjugate to each other  and from the partial fraction decomposition follows that it has positive residue .",
    "this means that , in this region , the diagonal - plus - photon sector contains one physical massive state ( becoming massless in the limit @xmath139 ) , and two states that can , at best , be interpreted as confined .",
    "we have taken a first look at the potential consequences of restricting the path integral gauge field configurations to the gribov region , in order to deal with the inherent ambiguity in non - abelian gauge fixing .",
    "we considered here the @xmath2 @xmath0 theory .",
    "the propagator of the gauge fields can get considerably modified by the presence of the nonperturbative gribov parameters , in addition to the influence of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field . from the gauge boson pole structure",
    ", we distinguished a few regions in the @xmath140 parameter space for the physical spectrum of the theory , see in particular  [ regionsdiag ] .    for those values of the couplings and higgs vacuum expection value which we expect perturbation theory to work for",
    ", we do recover the perturbative yang  mills ",
    "higgs propagators .",
    "this is an important observation , as it means that the gribov ambiguity does not spoil the physical vector boson interpretation of the gauge sector of the electroweak model at energies where it is relevant ( i.e.  experimentally probed ) . for higher values of the non - abelian coupling constant",
    "the gribov horizon lets its influence be felt and the propagators become deeply modified , as was anticipated by the authors of @xcite . for nonzero electromagnetic charge ,",
    "the @xmath120 bosons have a different behavior from the photon and @xmath36 boson . for all gauge bosons ,",
    "however , there is an intermediate region where a massive , physical pole still appears in the propagator , accompanied by a nonphysical pole with negative residue . at strong coupling all physical poles but one disappear (",
    "become complex ) and it seems that only one massive particle is left in the spectrum .",
    "this massive state becomes the massless photon in the limit @xmath139 , an important limiting case .",
    "as we predict here and in previous works @xcite a quite rich `` propagator spectrum '' in terms of the parameters @xmath141 , we hope this will stimulate further numerical studies of the propagators in such models @xcite .    in the current work ,",
    "the focus was on the spectrum of gauge bosons using the generalization of the semi - classical gribov no - pole analysis .",
    "topics we did not touch upon yet are the generalization to all orders of the restriction to the gribov region ( e.g.  following @xcite or @xcite ) , the dynamical self - correction of the gribov  zwanziger action @xcite which affects the pole location amonst other things , and most importantly , the phase diagram of gauge  higgs systems in terms of a variable interaction constant @xmath10 and higgs expectation value @xmath142 .",
