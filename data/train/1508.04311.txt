    "despite recent advances in atomic scale continuum modeling of crystalline freezing @xcite , and efforts relying on the orientation field models @xcite , the phase - field theoretical methods based on the multiphase - field ( mpf ) concept remain the method of choice , when addressing complex polycrystalline or multiphase / multi - component problems , such as multi - component phase separation or grain coarsening .",
    "a common feature of these models is that the individual physical phases / chemical components / solid grains are described by separate fields @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "a variety of this kind of models is available in the literature ranging from the early formulations by chen and yang @xcite , steinbach @xcite , steinbach and pezzola @xcite , chen and coworkers @xcite , via later descendants by nestler and coworkers @xcite , moelans and coworkers @xcite , to more recent developments by folch and plapp @xcite , kim _ et al . _",

    "@xcite , by emmerich and coworkers @xcite , and kim _ et al .",
    "these models differ in important details that improve the individual models in various respects relative to the others .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to compare them from a theoretical viewpoint , and identify the possible advantages / disadvantages they have relative to each other , to see whether a more general formulation that unifies the advantageous features can indeed be constructed on the basis of the work done so far in this field .",
    "+ in attempting to develop a consistent description of interface driven multi - domain dynamics , we need to first identify the criteria the models have to satisfy .",
    "a few of such criteria have already been formulated along the development of the mpf models :    \\(i ) the _ multiphase - field _ descriptions view @xmath1 as the local and temporal volume / mass / mole fraction of the component / grain , prescribing thus @xmath2 .",
    "( this work concentrates exclusively on these mpf models ; the _ multi order parameter _",
    "theories @xcite , which do not require this criterion , will be addressed elsewhere . )",
    "\\(ii ) a further natural requirement is that the physical results should be independent of the labeling of the variables .",
    "this condition is termed the  principle of formal indistinguishability  of the fields .",
    "\\(iii ) the solution of the dynamic equations should tend towards the equilibrium solution obtained from the respective euler - lagrange equations ( eles ) based on the free energy functional , where the equilibrium solution minimizes then the free energy of the system .",
    "\\(iv ) as time evolves the free energy of the total system should decrease monotonically ( second law of thermodynamics ) .",
    "\\(v ) it is an evident requirement that the formulations for different numbers of phases or grains should be consistent with each other ; i.e. , it should be possible to recover the respective models from each other , when adding or removing a new phase / grain / orientation .",
    "it has been suggested recently that the usual variational approach to the mpf model does not satisfy this condition @xcite .",
    "\\(vi ) another fairly general requirement , formulated by several authors , is that ( a ) the two - phase planar interfaces should represent a ( stable ) equilibrium , and should be free of additional phases .",
    "this requirement can be extended to the dynamics ( b ) as follows : if a phase is not present , it should not appear deterministically ( in the absence of fluctuations ) at any time .",
    "this is often called the condition of `` no spurious phase generation '' .",
    "the applicability of this requirement makes depends on the problem addressed : in the case of grain coarsening , for instance , an uncontrolled appearance of new grains / orientations at the grain boundaries needs to be avoided .",
    "( in other problems , however , metastable structures @xcite or precipitates @xcite may appear at the solid - liquid interface , requiring models that are able to describe such phenomena @xcite . )",
    "this criterion for the absence of a third phase has been enforced different ways in different models .",
    "for example , folch and plapp @xcite have defined the free energy surface so that in the binary equilibrium the system stays in a two - phase subspace of the respective gibbs simplex .",
    "@xcite , in turn , used the mobility matrix to force the system to avoid the formation of the third phase irrespectively of the free energy surface ( and thus the equilibrium states of the system ) .    finally , a practical requirement :    \\(vii ) the model should allow the prescription of independent data for the interfacial properties and the kinetic coefficient of the individual phase pairs ( including their possible anisotropy ) .",
    "+ while most of these criteria formulate natural / self - evident requirements , some of them were neglected when developing previous mpf models .    in the present paper",
    ", we formulate an mpf approach that obeys all the criteria defined above .",
    "herein , we address _ interface driven _",
    "phenomena , in which the free energy density incorporates exclusively the  interfacial  contributions , comprising the gradient energy and multi - well terms , whereas driving forces associated with tilting functions@xcite are not considered .",
    "( an extension that includes the latter will be outlined elsewhere . )",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the mathematical formulation of criteria ( i ) to ( vii ) . in section iii , we first investigate which of these criteria are satisfied and which are not by the existing mpf models . we also point out which features of the individual approaches can be adopted in developing a consistent theory . in section",
    "iv we outline the generalized mpf formulation ( henceforth abbreviated as xmpf ) that satisfies criteria ( i ) to ( vii ) . in section v , we perform illustrative simulations using the xmpf approach to demonstrate the robustness of the theory .",
    "section vi is devoted to a comparison with other models .",
    "finally , in section vii , we offer a few concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss mathematical formulations of criteria ( i ) to ( vii ) identified above in details .      in the multiphase approach ,",
    "the following local constraint [ criterion ( i ) ] applies for the variables : @xmath3 as result of this constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq : genfunc ] ) is not an order parameter model , since normally different order parameters capturing various aspects of symmetry breaking are coupled to each other via physical laws , whereas here eq .",
    "( [ eq : genfunc ] ) prescribes a rather specific relationship : @xmath1 represents the local fraction of the @xmath4th phase , not identifiable as a quantity , whose magnitude is associated with the extent of symmetry breaking . + the general interface contribution of a multiphase free energy functional",
    "is usually written as : @xmath5 = \\int dv \\left\\ { \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2 } \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij}(\\nabla u_i \\cdot \\nabla u_j ) + w \\ , g(\\mathbf{u } )   \\right\\ } \\enskip , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the vector of the variables , @xmath7 is the free energy density landscape , and @xmath8 is a coefficient matrix of the general quadratic term for the gradients .",
    "for example , choosing @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 ) is the identity matrix yields a simple sum of the gradient square terms , @xmath11 [ where @xmath12 results in a pure pairwise construction , while @xmath13 , @xmath14 corresponds to the anti - symmetrized ( landau - type ) gradient term .",
    "the ( generally ) @xmath15-dependent coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be related to the pairwise interfacial properties ( the interfacial free energy and the interface thickness ) .",
    "+ the equilibrium solution can be found by solving the multiphase euler - lagrange equations : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the functional derivative of the free energy functional with respect to @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a lagrange multiplier emerging from the local constraint described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gencond ] ) . eliminating the lagrange multiplier results in @xmath22 thus offering the most general description of equilibrium . + for non - conserved variables , the dynamic equations are written in the following general form : @xmath23 where the mobility matrix can be determined from the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the time derivatives sum up to zero [ it follows from criterion ( i ) ] : @xmath24 2 .",
    "the variables are not labeled , i.e. , none of them is distinguished on the basis of its index [ criterion ( ii ) ] .",
    "3 .   the solutions of the euler - lagrange equations must be stationary solutions of the dynamic equations [ a requirement that follows from criterion ( iii ) ] : @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : genelv ] ) .    applying condition 1 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : gendin ] ) results in the general form @xmath27 where @xmath28 still can be arbitrary . furthermore , using condition 2 yields @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gendin2 ] ) and ( [ eq : gendin3 ] ) resulted in a mobility matrix , whose elements sum up to zero in each row and column .",
    "finally , condition 3 results in a symmetry condition , i.e. @xmath31 ( for the derivation , see appendix a ) .",
    "since @xmath32 , @xmath33 mobilities can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "+ next we have to test the mobility matrix against the time dependence of the total free energy .",
    "the main reason of applying a linear approximation for the dynamic equations is to establish a free energy minimizing behavior [ criterion ( iv ) ] . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : gendin ] ) , the condition for the time derivative of the total free energy reads as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mobility matrix , and we use the short notation @xmath36 .",
    "since the free energy must decrease in any volume , we can write @xmath37 indicating that the mobility matrix must be _ positive semidefinite_. a special , frequently made choice for the mobility matrix is the _ lagrangian _",
    "mobility @xmath38 .",
    "although this matrix is used quite widely , the dynamic equations are necessarily @xmath39 [ i.e. , criterion ( v ) is not satisfied ] , and it does not solve the problem of spurious phase appearance in non - equilibrium processes in general , as will be discussed later .",
    "herein we address pattern coarsening phenomena , for which the requirement of no spurious phase appearance needs to be satisfied [ criterion ( vi ) ] . in general",
    ", this criterion means that any @xmath40phase equilibrium solution ( i.e. , when exactly @xmath40 fields are present ) must be stable against the appearance of a new phase .",
    "accordingly , assuming that @xmath41 of the @xmath42 phases ( namely , @xmath43 ) are missing in an equilibrium solution @xmath26 , the condition can be re - formulated as : @xmath44-f[\\mathbf{u}^*(\\mathbf{r } ) ] \\geq 0\\ ] ] for _ any _ small perturbation for which @xmath45 and at least one of @xmath46 is not equal to zero . in other words , leaving the @xmath47 dimensional subspace ( together with keeping the local constraint , naturally ) always has to result in higher energy .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the equilibrium solutions representing minima of the free energy functional : since @xmath48 = f[\\mathbf{u}^*]+\\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta \\mathbf{u}}\\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{u}^t + \\frac{\\delta \\mathbf{u } \\cdot \\mathbb{d } \\cdot \\delta \\mathbf{u}^t}{2 } + \\dots \\enskip , \\ ] ] the second term on the right hand side vanishes for a solution of the euler - lagrange equation : @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath50 is positive definite , the equilibrium solution is a minimum .",
    "consequently , if the binary planar interfaces represent minima of the multiphase functional , they are stable against the appearance of additional phases , which is a crucial requirement from the viewpoint of criterion ( vi ) . + to fulfill criterion ( vi ) , we also have to ensure the proper dynamic behavior of the system .",
    "the condition of no spurious phase appearance can be generalized for the non - equilibrium regime as follows : if a phase is not present in the system , it must not appear deterministically , i.e. @xmath51 unfortunately , in an _ arbitrary _ , @xmath40phase non - equilibrium state @xmath52 , the condition @xmath53-f[\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{r})]>0 $ ] can not be satisfied for all possible perturbations .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ eq : spuricondd ] ) can not be guaranteed on the level of the free energy functional _ in general_. note , however , that the mobility matrix defines a conditional functional derivative , which allows the system to leave the @xmath40dimensional subspace only in particular directions [ or , in other words , not any @xmath54 state is available from @xmath52 in the dynamics ] .",
    "for special mobility matrices , like the lagrangian matrix , one may find such a free energy functional that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : spuricondd ] ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the free energy functional should not depend on the form of the mobility matrix in general .",
    "this problem is resolved in a recent work @xcite , in which the authors choose a mobility matrix having vanishing rows ( and columns ) for the fields not being present .",
    "although this concept trivially results in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spuricondd ] ) , the application of such a matrix together with a particular free energy functional can be dangerous in the sense that it may generate stationary solution from a non - equilibrium state , a possibility that has to be checked for all solutions obtained .",
    "in this section , we analyze the most frequently used multiphase - field theories from the viewpoint of equilibrium solutions .",
    "we check whether the trivial extension of the planar interface emerging from the binary reduction of the free energy functional is a solution of the multiphase problem too . summarizing , we require that the equilibrium solution for the pure binary planar interface in the multiphase - field problem ( @xmath55 ) coincides with the equilibrium solution for the binary planar interface of the binary ( @xmath42 = 2 ) problem [ criterion ( iv ) ] . the methodology for testing this feature consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "take the free energy functional in the two - phase limit ; 2 .   solve the respective euler - lagrange equation of the two - phase problem for planar interface geometry , resulting in @xmath56 ; 3 .",

    "first , setting @xmath165 in the @xmath42-phase free energy functional @xmath166 should result in the @xmath164 phase functional , @xmath167 . the same should apply for the dynamic equations @xmath168 as well ; i.e. , @xmath169 should reduce to @xmath170 , and @xmath171 . note that the latter satisfies the condition of no spurious phase generation [ criterion ( ii ) ] ) , since @xmath172 . here",
    "@xmath173 is a general , symmetric , positive semidefinite @xmath42phase mobility matrix , i.e. @xmath174 for @xmath175 , while @xmath176 , where @xmath177 , and @xmath111 . since the ( modified ) bollada - jimack - mullis matrix defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bjmmob ] ) satisfies the condition of formal reducibility , we choose this mobility matrix , namely , @xmath178 where constant positive prefactors @xmath179 accounting for the mobility of the planar @xmath180 interface are also incorporated .",
    "furthermore , we prescribe the condition of reduction also for the functional derivatives ; i.e. , the first @xmath164 components of @xmath181 should reduce to @xmath182 for @xmath165 .",
    "since the @xmath183 row ( and column ) of the reduced bollada - jimack - mullis matrix is @xmath184 , it always results in @xmath185 , therefore , @xmath186 can be arbitrary . since the @xmath187phase bollada - jimack - mullis matrix is positive semidefinite on an @xmath187phase state ( i.e. when none of the @xmath187 components vanishes ) with multiplicity 1 for the eigenvalue 0 ( it can be proven numerically ) , the @xmath187phase stationary solutions coincide with the @xmath187 phase equilibrium states .",
    "moreover , since the dynamic equations reduce naturally to the @xmath188phase case , the stationary solutions of the reduced dynamics include the natural @xmath42 phase extensions of the @xmath188phase equilibrium solutions ( where none of the @xmath164 phases is missing ) .",
    "therefore , the natural @xmath42phase extensions of all @xmath188phase equilibrium solutions emerging from @xmath189 should represent extrema of @xmath190 .",
    "if this is true , the bollada - jimack - mullis matrix is not dangerous with respect to the free energy functional , since all stationary states of the dynamics represent equilibrium . since the condition must apply for arbitrary @xmath42 , the general condition for the free energy functional reads as follows : + _ the @xmath191phase trivial extensions of all @xmath40phase equilibrium solutions ( where all the @xmath40 phases are non - vanishing ) emerging from the @xmath40phase free energy functional @xmath192 must represent extrema of the @xmath191phase free energy functional @xmath193 too , for any @xmath194 . _",
    "+ for practical reasons , we introduce the following condition : for a field , which is not present , the functional derivative vanishes , i.e. @xmath195 if the lagrange multiplier also vanishes [ @xmath196 for _ all _ @xmath197phase equilibrium solutions of @xmath192 ( where @xmath198 arbitrary ) , while the free energy functional ( and the functional derivative ) reduces naturally , all trivial extensions of all @xmath40-phase equilibrium solutions remain equilibrium solutions of the @xmath42-phase free energy functional",
    ". consequently , here the bollada - jimack - mullis matrix does not stabilize non - equilibrium solutions , while preventing the appearance of spurious phases .",
    "note , that this is obviously not true for the models of steinbach _ et al .",
    "_ , steinbach and pezzola , nestler and wheeler , ankit _ et al .",
    "_ , and for the model potential used in the work of bollada , jimack , and mullis . although there the free energy functionals and the functional derivatives reduce naturally , and @xmath199 also applies , the planar two - phase interface solution generates different lagrange multipliers for the vanishing and non - vanishing fields in the complete ( @xmath42-phase ) euler - lagrange problem , indicating that the natural extensions of the planar two - phase interfaces do not represent equilibrium . yet , the application of the bollada - jimack - mullis mobility matrix transforms them into stationary solutions , showing that in these cases the application of the bollada - jimack - mullis matrix is  dangerous  .",
    "the main question is , how one should construct an interface term that satisfies the conditions given above .",
    "first , we consider the symmetric case , where all interface thicknesses and interfacial free energies are equal . following chen and co - workers @xcite and moelans and co - workers @xcite , the interface term of the free energy functional",
    "is constructed as follows @xmath200 where we use the following new ansatz for the multiphase barrier function : @xmath201 the functional derivative reads as @xmath202 - \\epsilon^2 \\nabla^2 u_i \\enskip , \\ ] ] which vanishes for @xmath203 .",

    "naturally , the same investigation should be repeated for all @xmath187phase equilibrium solutions of @xmath209 for any positive @xmath187 , however , this kind of study is out of the scope of the present paper . + it is important to mention , that eq .",

    "the tendency of increasing free energy is also ensured by the multi - well term defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spmodel ] ) , however there , as we have shown previously , the binary planar interfaces do not minimize the free energy functional in the general @xmath42-phase case .",
    "it is worth noting that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tothtendency ] ) contradicts folch and plapp @xcite , who expect that the polynomial degree of the @xmath7 function that penalizes the high - order multiple junctions would increase with @xmath42 .",
    "( [ eq : tothtendency ] ) shows that the double - obstacle function is not the only one that realizes this tendency , furthermore , here [ see eq .",

    "in this section , we review whether the proposed model satisfies indeed criteria ( i ) to ( vii ) .",
    "several of these criteria are satisfied owing to the specific formulation of our model [ these are ( i ) , ( iii )  ( vi ) , and ( vii ) ] as summarized in sub - section a. fulfillment of practical criterion ( ii ) , however , needs further investigation , which is undertaken in sub - section b. finally , illustrative simulations are presented for grain coarsening in sub - section c.      it can be shown that the proposed model satisfies the following criteria : + ( i ) @xmath2 ( see section iv.a ) ; + ( ii ) since the mobility matrix is symmetric , the physical results are invariant to formally exchanging pairs of field indices , @xmath244 , i.e. the variables are not labeled ( see section iv.a ) ; + ( iii ) under appropriate boundary conditions , any trivial multiphase extension of the equilibrium binary solution represents equilibrium solution of the multiphase problem , which is then a stationary solution of the dynamic equations towards which the time dependent solution evolves ( see section iv.d ) ; + ( iv ) since the mobility matrix is positive semidefinite , non - negative entropy production is ensured for both conserved and non - conserved dynamics ( see sections iv.a and vi.b ) ; + ( v ) reduction / extension of the @xmath42-field theory to @xmath164 or @xmath245 fields is trivial on the level of both the free energy functional ( and the functional derivative ) and the mobility matrix ( see sections iv.a and iv.d ) ; + ( vi ) no additional phases appear at the equilibrium binary interfaces ( see sections iv.b , iv.c , iv.d and vi.a ) , and the dynamic spurious phase generation is also excluded ( see sections iv.a and v.b ) ; + ( vii ) freedom for choosing independent interfacial ( @xmath246 and @xmath226 ) and kinetic properties ( @xmath247 ) for the individual binary boundaries , including their anisotropy ( see the formulation in sections iv.c and iv.d ) . + since the dynamic generation of spurious phases is excluded by the modified bollada - jimack - mullis mobility matrix , the trivial extensions of the equilibrium planar solutions represent equilibrium , and the stationary solutions of the dynamic equations coincide with the equilibrium solutions , hence the mobility matrix is regarded as not dangerous , when considering planar interfaces .",

    "have been chosen for the demonstration .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "10 , which shows the map of one of the fields ( the others are qualitatively similar ) at dimensionless times @xmath337 and @xmath338 , computed on a grid @xmath260 .",
    "while in the xmpf model proposed here , the free energy decreases monotonically with time as expected , in the model of steinbach _ et al . _",
    "( when relying on a non - variational formalism ) , the free energy increases initially , reaching then a maximum at about @xmath339 , followed by a slow decrease beyond .",
    "this behavior is presumably a consequence of the applied binary approximation , in which various terms of the variational equations of motion are omitted : once the free energy functional ( lyapunov functional ) is defined , the variational dynamics ensures a monotonic reduction of the free energy with time .",
    "any deviation from this approach raises the possibility of a non - monotonic time evolution of the free energy .",
    "in this work , we formulated a physically consistent multiphase - field theory for describing interface driven multi - domain processes .",
    "first , we identified a set of criteria , a physically consistent multiphase - field approach has to satisfy .",
    "these are : ( i ) the sum of the fields is 1 everywhere ; ( ii ) the physical results should be invariant to exchanging pairs of field indices , @xmath244 ; ( iii ) a trivial multiphase extension of the equilibrium binary solution should represent an equilibrium solution of the multiphase problem , which in turn should be a stationary solution of the dynamic equations towards which the time dependent solutions evolve ; ( iv ) variational dynamic equations shall be used to ensure non - negative entropy production ; ( v ) reduction / extension of the @xmath42-field theory to @xmath164 or @xmath245 fields should be straightforward , and happen consistently within the formalism ; ( vi ) there should be no spurious third phase appearance at the equilibrium binary boundaries , and once a field is not present , it should not appear at any time in the dynamic equations ; finally , ( vii ) freedom to choose the interfacial and kinetic properties for individual phase pairs .",
    "next , considering these requirements , we have reviewed a range of the existing multiphase field models , and identified their advantageous and less advantageous features .    combining the advantageous features of the earlier multiphase - field models , we have constructed a multiphase - field approach ( termed the xmpf model ) obeying all criteria defined above .",
    "in addition , we performed illustrative simulations for @xmath263 and 5 multiphase - field models that rely on conserved dynamics , describing thus multiphase separation problems ( @xmath42-component cahn - hilliard problems ) .",
    "symmetric ( identical interface properties ) , asymmetric ( pairwise different interface properties ) , and anisotropic ( orientation dependent interfacial properties ) cases were addressed , and it has been shown that using a suitable mobility matrix ( bollada - jimack - mullis type ) , the xmpf model avoids dynamic spurious phase generation .",
    "we have performed further illustrative simulations for grain coarsening in polycrystalline systems using an @xmath309 xmpf model relying on non - conserved dynamics . while the predicted limiting grain size distribution is closer to the experimental results than those from the previous mpf models , further works is needed to improve the agreement .",
    "the present work opens up the way towards physically consistent computations for microstructure evolution in multiphase / multigrain / multicomponent structures , and shall serve as a basis for developing a physically consistent _ quantitative _ multiphase - field approach that might be combined with melt flow and elasticity , and extended to fast processes along the lines described in refs .",
    "@xcite , leading towards developing improved tools for knowledge based materials design .",
    "work is underway to incorporate a phase - dependent thermodynamic driving force ( a multiphase analogy of the tilting function in ref .",
    "@xcite ) into the xmpf model , which will be presented in a separate paper .    we note in this respect that the inclusion of thermodynamic driving force via a tilting function has no effect on the present results concerning the two- and multiphase equilibria .",
    "the existence of equilibrium two - phase planar interfaces in the multiphase problem is a basic requirement , which needs to be satisfied by a physically consistent model .",
    "the general dynamic equations of a multiphase model read as : @xmath340 where there are @xmath341 mobilities ( @xmath247 ) . _",
    "the principle of formal indistinguishability _ of the variables means that the variables are not `` labeled '' , i.e. none of them is distinguished formally on the basis of its index .",
    "this is true if the dynamic equations are invariant for the re - labeling of the variables , i.e. re - labeling of the variables on the level of the free energy functional results in the same as re - labeling the variables in the dynamic equations .",
    "this criterion is satisfied by symmetric mobility matrices , namely , @xmath342    _ proof .",
    "_ the dynamic equation for @xmath343 reads as @xmath344 the variables can be re - labeled by using the variable transformation @xmath345 for @xmath346 , @xmath347 , and @xmath348 . using this in eq .",
    "( [ eq : appa1 ] ) yields then @xmath349 where the chain rule for the functional derivative has also been used ( see appendix a2 ) .",
    "furthermore , re - labeling variables in the free energy functional first ( @xmath350\\to f[\\mathbf{v}]$ ] ) , then deriving the dynamic equations simply results in @xmath351 comparing the two equations yields then @xmath352 . + in order to illustrate the `` no labeling '' condition in practice , we choose a typical example of labeling the variables .",
    "some authors eliminate of one of the variables even at the level of the free energy functional , i.e. they introduce the independent variables @xmath353 for @xmath354 , thus resulting in @xmath355 .",
    "then , the following dynamic equations are used : @xmath356 these can be written in terms of the old variables as : @xmath357 for @xmath354 , and @xmath358 it is straightforward to see , that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : elim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : elim2 ] ) prescribe the following mobility matrix : @xmath359 for @xmath354 , while the last row reads as @xmath360 where the form @xmath361 is used .",
    "it is trivial that the elements of @xmath35 sum up to 0 in each row and column , but the matrix is not symmetric !",
    "it means that the concept of eliminating a variable on the level of the free energy functional labels the variables , i.e. the eliminated variable is formally distinguished . indeed , exchanging variables @xmath362 and @xmath42 , deriving the dynamic equations , then exchanging @xmath362 and @xmath42 back result in a mobility matrix similar to the one described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : elim1 ] ) and ( [ eq : elim2 ] ) , however , the @xmath183 and the @xmath363 rows are exchanged . on the one hand , it means that the formal variable exchange corresponds to the elimination of phase @xmath362 instead of phase @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the resulting mobility matrix is not identical to the original one , the eliminated variable is always labeled , therefore , this concept does not satisfy the condition of no labeling .",

    "the solution of the euler - lagrange equations is invariant to the choice of the generalized variables .",

    "( [ eq : solve ] ) .",

    "the construction of the free energy functional and the modified bollada - jimack - mullis mobility matrix , however , ensure that the system converges to equilibrium .",
    "this means that no artificial modification of the solution is needed after a time step , which could lead to instabilities in the spectral method .",
