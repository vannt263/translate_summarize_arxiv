    "within the recent past , much progress has been made in characterizing the important dynamics of accretion flows .",
    "the magnetorotational instability @xcite has been applied to accretion disks @xcite and been shown to drive mhd fluid turbulence that can provide an outward angular momentum flux and mass accretion rate consistent with astrophysical observations , as demonstrated in a variety of numerical simulations @xcite",
    ". however , there exists observational evidence of hot dilute flows , in accretion about dim mass - starved supermassive black holes , for which the mean free path is of the order of the system scale or larger .",
    "chandra x - ray observations by @xcite have resolved the inner 1  around the sagittarius a central black hole and demonstrated that the ion mean free path at its capture radius is only a few times smaller than the system scale .",
    "the unambiguous detection of faraday rotation in the high- frequency radio emission about sagittarius a @xcite implies that the magnetic field is very easily strong enough to result in a gyrokinetic reduction in plasma dynamics .",
    "estimates of mass accretion from the ambient conditions about this object overestimate its bolometric luminosity by approximately five orders of magnitude over radiatively efficient accretion @xcite , implying that very little of the gravitational energy produced by mass accretion is radiated .",
    "however , recent nonlinear local simulations , with limits on electron pressure anisotropy due to gyrokinetic electron instabilities , show that the nonlinear development of the collisionless mri can turbulently heat electrons sufficiently to allow these flows to become radiative @xcite ; accretion in collisionless environments , such as those around sag",
    ".  a * , may naturally be radiative enough that the accretion rate must remain orders of magnitude below the bondi rate in order to explain their low luminosity .",
    "regardless of whether this accretion is radiatively inefficient , it is very likely that in the steady state these plasmas are dilute , optically thin , and the bulk of their thermal energy lies with the protons . furthermore , mhd plasma turbulence that transports energy generated from accretion may play an important role even in high - energy radiative , but collisionless , accretion flows .",
    "the fact that , very plausibly , these systems may be radiatively inefficient points to the fact that these high energy , dilute plasmas are at least partially pressure supported ; this is in contrast to a large class of models of radiatively efficient classical accretion disks , in which the accreting disk of matter remains geometrically thin and rotationally supported due to the efficient radiation of energy perpendicular to the disk",

    "a formulation of magnetized plasma dynamics that is especially well - suited for collisionless or mildly collisional mhd plasma equilibrium and dynamics is that of kulsrud s drift - kinetic approximation to the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "to lowest order the particle distribution function is characterized by dynamics only along magnetic field lines , mhd conditions of quasi - neutrality with ions and electrons moving together , and conservation of magnetic moment for particle distributions .",

    "fluid mhd models of local nonlinear evolution in collisionless astrophysical plasmas have employed prescriptions to model collisionless and fast , small - length scale isotropizing phenomena .",
    "first , landau fluid expressions of heat flux and viscosity represent , as practical as is possible , the collisionless momentum and heat transport driven by the instabilities of interest . and second , a hard wall on relative ionic pressure anisotropies reflects observations of marginal pressure anisotropy in the solar wind @xcite , due to unresolvable fast ( on the order of the ion gyroperiod ) and short wavelength ( on the order of the ion gyroradius ) instabilities driven by pressure anisotropy .",
    "similar pressure anisotropies are found to develop for the cmvti , as shown by a more comprehensive stability analysis @xcite .",
    "although these prescriptions have been fruitfully applied to local simulations of the collisionless mri @xcite and the buoyancy instability @xcite , a more self - consistent numerical model is desired .",
    "a more productive approach would be to use gyrokinetic or drift - kinetic mhd codes , such as fokker - planck @xcite , ionic particle in cell @xcite , or hybrid pic @xcite modified such that ions move drift - kinetically , to simulate the dynamics of these plasmas .",
    "recent work in modifying full particle in cell @xcite and 3d hybrid particle in cell @xcite for co - rotating local reference frames has found promise in the study of the collisionless differentially rotating plasmas , currently under situations in which the separation of length and time scales with ion gyromotion , disk rotational frequency , and the fastest growing wavelengths of the mri are not too severe .",
    "these numerical models have shown promise in understanding the nonlinear development of initially weak - field ( ion gyroradius larger than the wavelength of the fastest growing mode ) magnetotational instabilities @xcite .",
    "enhancements to these codes towards larger spatial and temporal separations between ion gyromotion and the slower , longer scale dynamics of collisionless mhd make them well suited towards understanding the nature of heat flux and angular momentum transport in the cmvti .",
    "the author would like to thank the referees , whose input has clarified and focused this paper into a generalization of the mvti into the collisionless regime , for pointing out a crucial reference @xcite demonstrating that the collisionless mri may heat electrons such that even collisionless accretions flows may become radiative , and for allowing a further iteration to repair mistakes in content .",
