    "<S> 1@xmath3#1    there has been resurgence of interest in transition metal oxides with the perovskite structure owing to their wide range of electronic and magnetic properties . among them , the hole doped manganites @xcite have been occupying a special position : they exhibit dramatic phenomena like colossal magnetoresistance and are being intensively studied with prospect for technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> lamno@xmath4 , the parent material of the manganites , is an antiferromagnetic insulator . upon sufficient doping </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath5 0.15 ) with divalent ions ( such as sr , ca ) , the system is driven metallic . </S>",
    "<S> the holes are allowed to move only if adjacent spins are parallel , which results in a dramatic increase in the conductivity when the spins order ferromagnetically , an effect which can be induced by applying a magnetic field or by lowering the temperature below the curie temperature , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the carrier mobility is intimately related to the underlying magnetic state of the system , and there have been considerable efforts in recent times to identify the interactions that control the magnetoresistive properties . </S>",
    "<S> an approach in this direction has been to analyze the spin dynamics of the doped manganites .    </S>",
    "<S> early experiments on la@xmath7pb@xmath8mno@xmath4 @xcite indicated that the spin - wave dispersion @xmath9 in the doped manganites could be interpreted in terms of a conventional heisenberg ferromagnet with only the nearest - neighbor exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with the double - exchange limit of the one - band ferromagnetic kondo lattice model @xcite , implying that conduction @xmath0 electrons move in a tight - binding band with one orbital per site and interact with localized @xmath1 spins via the large intraatomic exchange @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> however , more recent experiments @xcite on other doped manganites have found strong deviation of @xmath9 from the simple cosine - like behavior expected from a nearest - neighbor heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> farther neighbor interactions in addition to the nearest neighbor one had to be taken into account to reproduce softening of the dispersions for the wave vector @xmath11 approaching the zone boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the one - band models could not explain the observed zone boundary softening , even qualitatively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was then suggested that additional degrees of freedom , probably the lattice degrees of freedom , may play an important role in the spin dynamics of these materials . </S>",
    "<S> recently @xcite , it was shown that the softening at the zone boundary has a purely electronic origin , and could be explained within the framework of _ ab initio _ density functional band calculations , in the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous work @xcite also carried out a perturbative analysis of the exchange interaction strengths within a tight - binding model considering the double degeneracy of @xmath0 levels on the mn site . </S>",
    "<S> it was argued that the degeneracy of @xmath0 orbitals plays important roles , and simply by taking into account the proper structure of the kinetic hopping between nearest - neighbor @xmath0 levels one can , to a large extent , understand the behavior of two strongest interactions , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in the half - metallic regime . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath14 corresponds to the exchange interaction between the @xmath15-th neighbor atoms @xcite , as defined later by eq .  </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , it was pointed out that a realistic model including the oxygen @xmath2-orbitals and the mn @xmath1 orbitals could indeed modify the quantitative aspects of the results . while the fully - filled majority spin @xmath1 orbitals could contribute an antiferromagnetic superexchange component to @xmath12 , the partially filled minority spin @xmath1 orbitals could , as suggested by the _ ab initio _ band structure calculations , contribute a ferromagnetic double exchange component . further @xmath16 was found to increase quite strongly in the @xmath0-only model , unlike the weak dependence seen in the _ ab initio _ results . </S>",
    "<S> the previous work @xcite suggested that the oxygen @xmath2 bands could modify @xmath16 considerably as the mn 3@xmath17-o 2p energy separation is comparable with the exchange splitting of the majority and minority spin orbitals . in the light of these observations , </S>",
    "<S> we have attempted to make further quantitative analysis to understand the origin of the observed zone - boundary softening . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done by mapping the results of the _ ab initio _ band structure calculations onto a tight - binding model which gives us flexibility of constructing simpler models and analyzing the contributions to the observed softening .    the band structure for hypothetical cubic ferromagnetic lamno@xmath4 with the lattice parameter of 3.934   , calculated within the linear - muffintin orbital method with the atomic sphere approximation ( lmto - asa ) , </S>",

    "<S> another useful information about the flattening of the dispersion beyond half way to the zone boundary is given by comparing eq .  </S>",

    "<S> model b(c ) includes @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) orbitals on the mn atoms and all @xmath2 orbitals on the oxygens . </S>",
    "<S> as the density of states ( dos ) obtained within model a suggests partial occupancy of the minority spin @xmath1 bands with @xmath60 0.175 electrons even for the undoped case , the fermi energy ( @xmath61 ) of model c in the undoped case was adjusted so that the minority spin @xmath1 bands had 0.175 electrons . as a consequence , the number of holes in the majority spin @xmath0 states of model b in the undoped case </S>",
    "<S> should be larger by 0.175 than the case when the minority spin @xmath1 states are not occupied . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 partial dos for models b and c along with the result for model a which considers all @xmath17 orbitals on the mn atom are shown in fig .  3 . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced models ( b and c ) are found to give a good description of the respective @xmath17 partial dos of @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetry within model a. further justification for the treatment of the contributions from @xmath0 and @xmath1 states separately is given by the fact that the dominant contributions , ( @xmath45 , @xmath38=1,4,8 ) , are all for the pairs along @xmath62 for which there is no mixing of the two states in the exchange coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the spin wave dispersion was calculated in the reduced models separately . </S>",

    "<S> 3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 denotes the number of doped @xmath0 holes with reference to the half filled majority spin @xmath0 band . </S>",
    "<S> ( equivalently , @xmath64 is the number of electrons in the @xmath0 band . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 in the parentheses indicates the hole concentration in model a being equivalent to doping of divalent atoms . by considering the above situation </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath63=0.175 corresponds to the case of undoped lamno@xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> as the number of holes increases from @xmath66 , the spin - wave energy at the x point steadily decreases . in model c , on the other hand , the dominant contribution from the @xmath1 states to the exchange coupling is antiferromagnetic superexchange . </S>",
    "<S> the negative spin - wave energy for all @xmath56 ( fig.3d ) is consistent with this expectation . </S>",
    "<S> however , small occupation of the minority spin @xmath1 states produces a ferromagnetic double exchange contribution . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 in fig.3d denotes the number of electrons in the minority spin @xmath1 states . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , doping of divalent elements reduces @xmath67 so that the double exchange contribution diminishes rapidly as is clearly seen in the @xmath67 dependence of the spin - wave dispersion in fig.3d . here </S>",
    "<S> again the corresponding value of @xmath42 in model a are indicated in brackets . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the @xmath0 states ( fig.3b ) and that from the @xmath1 states ( fig.3d ) for the common @xmath42 value are added and the resultant spin wave dispersion shown in fig.3e agrees very well with the one in fig.1b ( model a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis suggests that the main source of the zone - boundary softening of the spin wave dispersion by doping of divalent atoms for @xmath68 is the reduction in the ferromagnetic double exchange of the @xmath1 electrons . on the other hand , in the doping range of @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath1 states may simply act as a source of antiferromagnetic superexchange and further softening and flattening of the spin wave dispersion comes from the @xmath0 states .    </S>",
    "<S> the doped holes within our model have considerable oxygen @xmath2 character , and the earlier results @xcite suggested that the itinerant oxygen band could modify the various exchange interaction strengths . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out that the role of oxygen @xmath2 states in the superexchange interaction is not only to mediate the @xmath70 transfer but also to make a direct additional contribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however in this treatment the banding effect of oxygen @xmath2 states was neglected . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption will not be justified for quantitative arguments if the @xmath2 band width is comparable to the @xmath71 energy separation , which is the case in our systems . in order to obtain information about the role of the oxygen @xmath2 band , we made further simplification in the model b that the hopping between oxygen atoms was neglected , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath21=@xmath22=0 ( model d ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the neglect of the hopping between the oxygen atoms could reduce the @xmath0 bandwidth , the spin wave dispersions were calculated for two values of @xmath23 - the value ( @xmath72  ev ) estimated already by the fitting ( results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) and an increased value of @xmath73  ev ( results shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersions shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a and 4b are qualitatively similar to each other . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the spin wave energy at the x point increases with doping being in contradiction to the behavior observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 and fig .  3b . </S>",
    "<S> since this model does not take into account the antiferromagnetic superexchange contributions coming from the @xmath1 degrees of freedom and affecting primarily the nearest - neighbor magnetic interactions , the ferromagnetic coupling @xmath12 remains to be the strongest interaction in the system . </S>",
    "<S> in such a situation , the form of the spin - wave dispersion is close to the cosine - like .    to analyze further the role played by the inter - oxygen hopping </S>",
    "<S> , the exchange interactions \\{@xmath45 } were obtained for the cases corresponding to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> as is expected , the behavior of @xmath12 is not affected so much by the @xmath74 hopping . by comparing the results of model a in fig.2 with those of model </S>",
    "<S> b in fig.5 , we see that the doping dependence of @xmath13 and @xmath48 comes primarily from the @xmath0 electrons </S>",
    "<S> . neglect of the @xmath74 hopping ( model d ) strongly suppresses @xmath13 and @xmath48 for @xmath42 @xmath75 0.2 , and zone boundary softening of the spin - wave dispersion become less pronounced . on the other hand , increase of @xmath16 with hole doping is enhanced by neglecting the @xmath74 hopping . </S>",
    "<S> the energy at x point increases in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( model d ) with hole doping , because the variation in @xmath12 in this case is not enough to offset the sharp increase in @xmath16 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have analyzed the low - temperature spin dynamics of the doped manganites with tight - binding models . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide some insight into the roles of the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 states and also suggest that the channel of hopping between the oxygen atoms strongly modifies the exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> thus for the correct quantitative and sometimes even qualitative description , the simplifications made by model hamiltonian approaches which consider only the @xmath0 orbitals are questionable .    </S>",
