    "since its introduction as a model for the periodic appearance of the ice ages @xcite , stochastic resonance has been observed in a large number of physical and biological systems , including lasers , electronic circuits and the sensory system of crayfish ( for reviews of applications , see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism of stochastic resonance can be illustrated in a simple model .",
    "consider the overdamped motion of a particle in a double - well potential .",
    "the two potential wells describe two macroscopically different states of the unperturbed system , for instance cold and warm climate .",
    "the particle is subject to two different kinds of perturbation : a deterministic periodic driving force ( such as the periodic variation of insulation caused by the changing eccentricity of the earth s orbit ) , and an additive noise ( modeling the random influence of the weather ) .",
    "each of these two perturbations , taken by itself , does not produce any interesting dynamics ( from the point of view of resonance ) .",
    "indeed , the periodic driving is assumed to have too small an amplitude to allow for any transitions between the potential wells in the absence of noise . on the other hand , without periodic forcing ,",
    "additive noise will cause the particle to jump from one potential well to the other at random times .",
    "the expected time between transitions is given asymptotically , in the small noise limit , by kramers time , which is proportional to the exponential of the barrier height @xmath5 over the noise intensity squared , namely @xmath6 .",
    "when both perturbations are combined , however , and their amplitudes suitably tuned , the particle will flip back and forth between the wells in a close to periodic way .",
    "thus the internal noise can significantly enhance the weak external periodic forcing , by producing large amplitude oscillations of the system , hence the name of resonance .",
    "the choice of the term resonance  has been questioned , as it would be more appropriate to refer to _ noise - induced signal - to - noise ratio enhancement _",
    "@xcite . in the regime of a periodic",
    "driving whose amplitude is not a small parameter , one also speaks of _ noise - induced synchronization _ @xcite .",
    "appreciable , though still sub - threshold amplitudes of the periodic driving have the advantage to enable transitions for small noise intensities , without requiring astronomically long driving periods .",
    "while the heuristic mechanism of stochastic resonance is rather well understood , a complete mathematical description is still lacking , though important progress has been made in several limiting cases . depending on the regime",
    "one is interested in , several approaches have been used to describe the phenomenon quantitatively .",
    "the simplest ones use a discretization of either time or space .",
    "when the potential is considered as piecewise constant in time , the generator of the autonomous case can be used to give a complete solution @xcite , showing that resonance occurs when driving period and kramers time are equal .",
    "alternatively , space can be discretized in order to obtain a two - state model , which is described by a markovian jump process @xcite .",
    "the two - state model has also been realised experimentally by an electronic circuit , called the schmitt trigger @xcite .    in physical experiments , one has often access to indirect characteristics of the dynamics , such as the power spectrum , which displays a peak at the driving frequency .",
    "the strength of the resonance is quantified through the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , which is proportional to the area under the peak ( this definition obviously leaves some liberty of choice ) .",
    "the snr has been estimated , in the limit of small driving amplitude , by using spectral theory of the fokker ",
    "planck equation @xcite , or a rateequation for the probability density @xcite .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is found to behave like @xmath7 , which reaches a maximum for @xmath8 .",
    "the probability density of the process , however , only gives part of the picture , and a more detailed understanding of the behaviour of individual paths is desirable .",
    "some interesting progress in this direction is found in @xcite .",
    "the approach applies to a very general class of dynamical systems , in the limit of vanishing noise intensity . when the period of the forcing scales like kramers time , solutions of the stochastic differential equation are shown to converge to periodic functions in the following sense : the @xmath9-distance between the paths and the periodic limiting function converges to zero in probability as the noise intensity goes to zero .",
    "due to its generality , however , this approach does not give any information on the rate of convergence of typical paths to the periodic function , nor does it estimate the probability of atypical paths . also , since the period of the forcing must scale like kramers time , the assumed small noise intensity goes hand in hand with exponentially long waiting times between interwell transitions .    in the present work ,",
    "we provide a more detailed description of the individual paths behaviour , for small but finite noise intensities and driving frequencies .",
    "we consider two classes of one - dimensional double - well potentials , symmetric and asymmetric ones .",
    "the height of the potential barrier is assumed to become small periodically , which allows us to consider situations where the period need not be exponentially large in @xmath10 for transitions between the wells to be likely .    in the case of an asymmetric potential , we are interested , in particular , in determining the optimal noise intensity as a function of the driving frequency and the minimal barrier height , guaranteeing a close - to - periodic oscillation between both wells",
    ". we will estimate both the deviation ( in space and time ) of typical paths from the limiting periodic function , and the asymptotics of the probability of exceptional paths .",
    "the case of a symmetric potential shows an additional feature .",
    "for the right choice of the noise intensity , transitions become likely once per period , at which time the new  well is chosen at random .",
    "we will again estimate the deviation from a suitable reference process and the asymptotics of the probability of exceptional paths .",
    "the systems are described by stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a brownian motion .",
    "the potential @xmath13 is @xmath0-periodic in @xmath14 , and admits two minima for every value of @xmath14 .",
    "the frequency @xmath1 , the minimal barrier height between the wells and the noise intensity @xmath2 are considered as ( moderately ) small parameters , the relation between which will determine the transition probability .    the first class of potentials we consider is symmetric in @xmath15 .",
    "a typical representative of this class is the potential @xmath16 here @xmath17 is a parameter controlling the minimal barrier height . we introduce the slow time @xmath18 for convenience .",
    "the potential has two wells , located at @xmath19 , separated by a barrier of height @xmath20 .",
    "the distance between the wells and the barrier height become small simultaneously , at integer values of @xmath21 .",
    "our results for symmetric potentials can be summarized as follows :    in the deterministic case @xmath22 , we describe the dependence of solutions on @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath1 ( theorem  [ thm_sdet ] ) .",
    "solutions starting at @xmath24 are attracted by the potential well at @xmath25 , which they track with a small lag . if @xmath26 , this lag is at most of the order @xmath27 ; if @xmath28 , it is at most of the order @xmath29 , but solutions never approach the saddle closer than a distance of order @xmath29 ( even if @xmath30 ) .    when noise is present , but @xmath2 is small compared to the maximum of @xmath23 and @xmath31 , the paths are likely to track the solution of the corresponding deterministic differential equation at a distance of order @xmath32 ( theorem  [ thm_snearxdet ] ) . the probability to reach",
    "the saddle during one time period is exponentially small in @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath2 is larger than both @xmath23 and @xmath31 , transitions between potential wells become likely , but are concentrated on the time interval @xmath34 $ ] ( repeated periodically ) . during this time interval , the paths may jump back and forth frequently between both potential wells , and they have a typical spreading of the order @xmath35 . after time @xmath36 ,",
    "the paths are likely to choose one of the wells and stay there till the next period ( theorem  [ thm_sescape ] ) .",
    "the probability to choose either potential well is exponentially close to @xmath3 , with an exponent of order @xmath37 , which is independent of @xmath23 ( theorem  [ thm_strans ] ) .",
    "this picture remains true when @xmath2 is larger than both @xmath38 and @xmath29 , but note that the spreading of paths during the transition may become very large . thus increasing noise levels",
    "will gradually blur the periodic signal .",
    "these results show a rather sharp transition to take place at @xmath39 , from a regime where the paths are unlikely to switch from one potential well to the other one , to a regime where they do switch with a probability exponentially close to @xmath3 ( ) .    the second class of potentials we consider is asymmetric , a typical representative being @xmath40 this is a double - well potential if and only if @xmath41 .",
    "we thus choose @xmath42 of the form @xmath43 near @xmath44 , the right - hand potential well approaches the saddle at a distance of order @xmath38 , and the barrier height is of order .",
    "a similar encounter between the left - hand potential well and the saddle occurs at @xmath45 .",
    "our results for asymmetric potentials can be summarized as follows :    in the deterministic case , solutions track the potential wells at a distance at most of order @xmath46 . if @xmath47 , they never approach the saddle closer than a distance of order @xmath48 ( theorem  [ thm_adet ] ) .    when @xmath2 is small compared to the maximum of and @xmath49 , paths are likely to track the deterministic solutions at a distance of order @xmath50 ( theorem  [ thm_anearxdet ] ) . the probability to overcome the barrier is exponentially small in @xmath51 .    for larger",
    "@xmath2 , transitions become probable during the time interval @xmath52 $ ] . due to the asymmetry , the probability to jump from the less deep potential well to the deeper one",
    "is exponentially close to one , with an exponent of order @xmath53 , while paths are unlikely to come back ( theorem  [ thm_atrans ] ) .",
    "this picture remains true when @xmath2 is larger than both and , but the spreading of paths during the transition may become very large .",
    "again , we find a rather sharp transition to take place , this time at @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast to the symmetric case , for large @xmath2 the paths are likely to jump from one potential well to the other at every half - period ( ) .    in both the symmetric and the asymmetric case , we thus obtain a high switching probability between the potential wells even for small noise intensities , provided minimal barrier height and driving frequency are sufficiently small .",
    "they only need , however , to be smaller than a power of @xmath2 : @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the symmetric case , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 in the asymmetric case are sufficient conditions for switching dynamics .",
    "our results require a precise understanding of dynamical effects , and the subtle interplay between the probability to reach the potential barrier , the time needed for such excursions , and the total number of excursions with a chance of success . in this respect ,",
    "they provide a substantial progress compared to the quasistaticapproach , which considers potentials that are piecewise constant in time . note that some of our results may come as a surprise . in particular , neither the width ( in time ) of the transition zone nor the asymptotics of the transition probability depend on the minimal barrier height @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the picture is independent of @xmath23 as soon as @xmath23 is smaller than @xmath31 ( in the symmetric case ) or @xmath1 ( in the asymmetric case ) , even for @xmath30 .",
    "this is due to the fact that when @xmath23 is small , the time during which the potential barrier is low is too short to contribute significantly to the transition probability .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the results are formulated in detail in section  [ sec_res ] , subsection  [ ssec_rsym ] being devoted to symmetric potentials , and subsection  [ ssec_rasym ] to asymmetric potentials . section  [ sec_sym ] contains the proofs for the symmetric case , while section  [ sec_asym ] contains the proofs for the asymmetric case .",
    "the fascinating problems related to stochastic resonance were brought to our attention by anton bovier , whom we would like to thank for stimulating discussions .",
    "thanks the wias for kind hospitality .",
    "we consider non - autonomous sdes of the form  . introducing the slow time @xmath18 allows to study the system on a time interval of order one .",
    "when substituting @xmath21 for @xmath59 , brownian motion is rescaled and we obtain an sde @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the force , derived from the potential @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is a standard wiener process on some probability space @xmath64 .",

    "let us introduce some notations .",

    "we will stress these facts only where confusion might arise .",
    "we consider in this subsection the sde in the case of @xmath61 being periodic in @xmath21 , odd in @xmath15 , and admitting two stable equilibrium branches , with a barrier  between the branches becoming small once during every time period .",
    "a typical example of such a function is @xmath108 we will consider a more general class of functions @xmath109 , which we assume to satisfy the following hypotheses :    _ smoothness : _",

    "is is easy to show that @xmath128 behaves like @xmath25 for small @xmath21 , and admits a quadratic minimum at a time @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , @xmath130 near @xmath44 .",
    "we can choose a constant @xmath131 such that the derivatives of @xmath132 and @xmath128 vanish only once in the interval @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "we finally require that @xmath128 , @xmath132 and @xmath134 are bounded away from zero outside this interval .",

    "we may thus assume that @xmath141 .",

    ", @xmath151 finally , the linearization of @xmath61 at @xmath137 satisfies @xmath152    we give the proof in subsection [ ssec_symdet ] .",
    "the relation may be surprising , since it means that no matter how small we make @xmath23 , @xmath137 never approaches the saddle at @xmath119 closer than a distance of order @xmath29 .",
    "this fact can be intuitively understood as follows .",
    "even if @xmath30 and near @xmath44 , we have @xmath153 since for @xmath154 , @xmath74 can not approach the origin significantly during any time interval of order @xmath29 .",
    "after such a time , however , the repulsion of the saddle will make itself felt again , preventing the solution from further approaching the origin .",
    "in other words , the time interval during which @xmath132 is smaller than @xmath31 is too short to allow the deterministic solution to come close to the saddle .",
    "we return now to the sde with @xmath155 .",
    "assume that we start at some deterministic @xmath156 .",
    "theorem 2.3 in @xcite shows that the paths are likely to track the deterministic solution @xmath137 with the same initial condition at a distance of order @xmath157 for any @xmath100 ( with probability @xmath158 ) , as long as the equilibrium branches are well separated , that is , at least for @xmath159 .",
    "a transition between the potential wells is thus unlikely if @xmath160 , and interesting phenomena can only be expected between the times @xmath143 and @xmath161 . upon completion of one time period ,",
    "i.e. , at time @xmath161 , the markov property allows to repeat the above argument .",
    "hence there is no limitation in considering the sde on the time interval @xmath133 $ ] , with a fixed initial condition @xmath162 satisfying @xmath163 .",

    "let us start by describing the dynamics in a  of @xmath137 .",
    "the main idea is that for @xmath2 sufficiently small , the typical spreading of paths around @xmath137 should be related to the variance @xmath164 of the solution of , linearized around @xmath137 .",
    "this variance is given by @xmath165 the variance is equal to zero at time @xmath143 , but behaves asymptotically like @xmath166 .",
    "in fact , if we define the function @xmath167 then @xmath164 differs from @xmath168 by a term that becomes negligible as soon as @xmath169 is larger than a constant times @xmath170 .",

    "the theorem shows that the typical spreading of paths around @xmath137 is of order @xmath187 if @xmath188 , we may choose @xmath189 for all times , and thus the probability of leaving a  of @xmath137 , let alone approach the other stable branch , is exponentially small ( in @xmath190 ) . on the other hand ,",
