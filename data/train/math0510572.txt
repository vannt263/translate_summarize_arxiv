    "the riemann hypothesis ( rh ) is a central problem in pure mathematics due to its connection with number theory and other branches of mathematics and physics .",
    "the rh is the statement that all the non trivial zeros of the zeta function @xmath2 lie on the critical line @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "most of the physical approaches to prove the rh are inspired by the old polya and hilbert conjecture , which states that the imaginary part , @xmath4 , of the riemann zeros @xmath5 , are the eigenvalues of a hamiltonian and thus real numbers if the rh is true @xcite .",
    "this approach is supported by the statistical properties of the zeros , the montgomery - odlyzko law @xcite , based on the gaussian unitary ensemble distribution ( gue ) @xcite , and also by the quantum chaos interpretation of the oscillatory part of the riemann counting formula of the zeros @xcite .",
    "berry has proposed that the riemann dynamics is given by a classical chaotic hamiltonian with isolated period orbits , whose quantization would yield a point like spectrum containing the @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "other physical approaches are based on statistical mechanics @xcite , superconformal invariance @xcite , supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , etc ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "an interesting related approach is the construction of a quantum mechanical potential containing in its spectrum the prime numbers @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our work is the hamiltonian @xmath7 , proposed by berry and keating , which reproduces at the semiclassical level the smooth part of the riemann s formula giving the number of non trivial zeros below a given number , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian is formal since a consistent quantization has not yet been found . in this paper",
    "we shall propose a solution of this problem defining @xmath0 on a lattice .",
    "this is achieved working , not with @xmath9 , but with its inverse @xmath10 , which turns out to be related to a class of qm models with limit cycles , or rather centers , in the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "the idea that the rg may have limit cycles was first considered by wilson in 1971 @xcite , however at the time no models with this behavior were known . in the last few years limit cycles in the rg have been discovered in various models in several physical contexts , including nuclear physics @xcite , quantum field theory @xcite , quantum mechanics @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite , effective low energy qcd @xcite , s - matrix models @xcite , few body systems and efimov states @xcite , etc ( for a review of see @xcite ) .",
    "the subject of duality cascades in supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite is also suggestive of limit - cycle behavior .",
    "the possibility of chaotic flows has also been recently considered @xcite .",
    "the relevant model for this work is the , so called , russian doll bcs model of superconductivity , and specially its qm version @xcite . in the rd model the standard pairing coupling @xmath11 flows periodically with the scale , a fact that is intimately related to the existence of a series of bound states of two electrons ( cooper pairs ) whose energies scale as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the period of the rg cycles .",
    "these bound states have a size that scales as @xmath14 which is the reason for calling them russian dolls , by analogy with the popular matrioskas .",
    "the rg period is the main feature of a rg with limit cycles . in the rd model",
    "it is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a coupling in the hamiltonian that breaks the time reversal symmetry .",
    "why should this model be related to the hamiltonian @xmath9 which seems so far apart ?",
    "some hints lie on the following observations . in the rd model",
    "the wave function of a cooper pair with energy @xmath8 is given approximately by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 label the energy levels of the electron pairs .",
    "since in this model the energies @xmath19 converge towards zero , @xmath20 , there exist a bound state with @xmath21 , whose wave function is @xmath22 .",
    "this form recalls the dirichlet series of the zeta function , @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "the latter sum is the interaction term that is multiplied by the coupling @xmath11 .",
    "apparently , the rd model should be connected to @xmath25 rather than to @xmath26 .",
    "it is worth to mention that in the cyclic sine gordon model , which also has a cyclic rg , the zeta function @xmath27 appears in the expression of the effective central charge , where @xmath16 is related to the period of the rg cycles as @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in the bk model where the formal eigenfunctions of the normal ordered hamiltonian @xmath29 are given by @xmath30 , that resembles the dirichlet series of @xmath26 .",
    "compare to this , the rd wave function with @xmath31 has in the exponent of @xmath32 the factor 1 instead of 1/2 , and the imaginary part is fixed to a constant @xmath16 instead of being energy dependent .",
    "we shall show in this paper that these two problems can be solved at once by relating the bk and the rd models by means of a third model whose classical hamiltonian is simply the inverse of the bk one , namely @xmath33 . in a deep sense , the bk and the rd models turn out to be the two faces of the same coin .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the bk and the rd models .",
    "we also define the inverse model based on @xmath34 and discuss its relation with the previous ones . in section iii",
    "we solve the inverse model in the continuum limit .",
    "in section iv we study its renormalization showing the existence of rg cycles and their connection with the continuous solution . in section",
    "v we give its exact solution , derive the smooth part of the riemann counting formula and present a numerical analysis . in section",
    "vi we generalize the inverse model and begin to study its properties .",
    "we state the conclusions and prospects in section vii .",
    "in this section we introduce the hamiltonians of the berry - keating model , the inverse model ( @xmath35 ) and the russian doll model , and study their relations which can be represented symbolically as    bk = bk^-1 rd [ symbol ]    before presenting the details , we shall start with an overview .    as we explained above , the classical version of the berry - keating hamiltonian",
    "@xmath36 is the product @xmath0 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the position and momentum of a particle moving in one dimension .",
    "@xmath36 fullfills some of the asumptions of the quantum chaos approach to the rh , particularly the breaking of time - reversal symmetry , to accomodate the gue hypothesis and suggestive analogies involving the zeta function , the trace formula , the riemann - siegel formula , etc .",
    "the bk proposal has however remained at a speculative level since a consistent qm model of @xmath39 has not been constructed in so far .    to solve this problem",
    "we shall define the hamiltonian @xmath40 , which at classical level is the inverse of the bk hamiltonian , namely @xmath33 .",
    "it would seem that nothing is gained by this trick .",
    "nevertheless , a consistent qm model can be constructed by quantizing @xmath33 on a lattice .",
    "the key observation is that the inverse of the momentum operator @xmath41 is the 1d green function @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the sign function .",
    "we shall define a regularized lattice version of the operator @xmath44 as the matrix @xmath45 , where @xmath32 and @xmath46 run over the integers @xmath47 .",
    "the quantization of the position operator @xmath37 is the diagonal matrix @xmath48 . in this construction",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath49 acts on a discrete hilbert space of dimension @xmath50",
    ".    it will be important to study the behaviour of @xmath49 under the renormalization group transformation which integrates the highest energy level reducing the size of the system to @xmath51 .",
    "for the model to be renormalizable one needs an extra term with coupling constant @xmath52 .",
    "the other coupling constant , @xmath53 , multiplies the term containing @xmath54 .",
    "hence the @xmath35 model depends on two couplings constants @xmath55 and @xmath52 . under the rg transformations @xmath55 remains invariant , while @xmath52 flows periodically with the scale",
    "this periodicity is in turn related to the spectrum of the @xmath35 model .",
    "the third hamiltonian is the qm russian doll hamiltonian , which is a generalization of the standard bcs model of superconductivity having a cyclic rg .",
    "the rd hamiltonian @xmath56 also depends on two coupling constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath58 multiplies a time - reversal breaking term , proportional to @xmath54 , while @xmath57 multiplies the familiar @xmath59-wave pairing interaction of the bcs model which preserves the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the spectrum of this model has a series of bound and antibound states with russian doll scaling .",
    "the rd model is brought in due to its close relationship with the @xmath35 model .",
    "indeed , we shall show that each eigenstate of the @xmath35 model coincides with the zero energy bound state of an associated rd model .",
    "this bound state appears at the threshold of that model . from the rg viewpoint these two models",
    "will also be related .",
    "the classical bk hamiltonian @xcite    h^cl_bk = x p , [ a1 ]    has classical trayectories given by the hyperbolas    x(t ) = x_0 e^t , p(t ) = p_0 e^-t .",
    "[ a2 ]    the dynamics is unbounded and one should not expect a discrete spectrum at the quantum level . despite of",
    "that , berry and keating regularized the model introducing the planck cell in phase space with sides @xmath60 , @xmath61 and area @xmath62 , such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "they computed the number of states @xmath65 , with an energy below @xmath8 , using the semiclassical formula    n_bk(e ) = = _ l_x^e / l_p d x _",
    "l_p^e / x dp +  [ a3 ]    where @xmath66 is the area of the region @xmath67 ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "the result is    n_bk(e ) = ( -1 ) + 1 +  [ a4 ]    taking into account a maslov phase @xmath68 , bk finally obtain    n_bk(e ) = ( -1 ) + +  [ a5 ]    where the energy @xmath8 is measured in units of @xmath69 .",
    "eq.([a5 ] ) agrees with the asymptotic expansion of the smooth part of the riemann counting formula of the non trivial zeros of the zeta function    n_sm(e ) = ( + e ) - + 1 .",
    "[ a6 ]    this expression is @xmath70 times the phase of the zeta function @xmath71 @xcite .",

    "the derivation of eq.([a5 ] ) is heuristic and , to our knowledge , has not been reproduced from the quantization of the bk hamiltonian .",
    "bhaduri et al .",
    "@xcite obtained eq.([a6 ] ) , up to some factor , studying the inverted harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath77 , which is related by a canonical transformation to @xmath9 .",
    "they employed a phase shift approach instead of the semiclassical bound state approach .",
    "the bk work was motivated by connes s work to prove the rh using p - adic numbers .",
    "this is known as the adelic approach to the rh and it is based on the construction of an abstract space where acts an hermitean operator , whose eigenvalues are the non trivial zeros of the zeta function @xcite .",
    "the truth of the rh lies in the proof of a certain classical trace formula .",
    "connes has also considered the operator @xmath9 in the adelic theory .",

    "there is also a negative sign of the term in ( [ a10 ] ) , associated to the asymptotic riemann formula , as compared with the bk formula ( [ a5 ] ) .",
    "according to connes , this negative sign agrees with the overall sign in a formal expression of @xmath81 obtained using the euler product formula of @xmath71 into ( [ a8 ] ) @xcite .",
    "these results imply that the riemann zeros , in the adelic approach , are missing states in a continuum spectrum .",
    "the physical picture is that of white light with dark absortion lines labelled by the zeros of the zeta function . using this analogy , the riemann zeros , according to bk , would be emission lines .",
    "our results are along the lines of connes , as we shall show .",

    "the smooth part of the riemann formula gives the number of missing bound states with respect to the leading term which follows from the scaling properties of the cyclic rg .",
    "it is a finite size correction of the russian doll scaling . in a certain sense , it can also be seen as an anomaly for the discrete rg transformations , i.e. the rg cycles , which leave the hamiltonians invariant .",
    "we have looked for a choice of parameters of the @xmath35 model that would explain the oscillating part of the riemann formula . in the rd language",
    "this means choosing the energy levels .",
    "however a numerical study shows that the best choice is given by equally space energy levels .",
    "it thus seems that the origin of the random position of the zeros lies beyond the @xmath35 model . to explain this randomness we propose a natural generalization of the @xmath35 and rd models where the coupling @xmath11 is replaced by a set of discrete couplings @xmath289 which depend on the level @xmath32 .",
    "the guiding principle is renormalizability , which in this context means the rg invariance of the time reversal breaking interaction .",
    "quite surprisingly , there are two models , @xmath252 , satisfying this condition",
    ". they differ in the way the rg procedure is implemented . in the @xmath268 model",
    ", the rg runs from the uv towards the ir , while in the @xmath270 model the order is reversed .",
