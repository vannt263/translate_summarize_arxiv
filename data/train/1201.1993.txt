    "granular media show a peculiar kinetic behavior including the possibility of exhibiting jammed configurations .",
    "jammed assemblies of grains at high densities are not able to explore the phase space but can eventually yield at high drives , for instance under shear stress , like a viscoplastic solid or a complex fluid @xcite . over the last years , experimental observations and numerical simulations of jammed granular media have repeatedly shown the heterogeneous distribution of stress and contact forces in dense packings @xcite .",
    "starting from the first studies of weight distributions in bead packs @xcite , the presence of force chains has been especially emphasized , chains which form an intricate force network structure and are responsible for most of the material s unusual properties .",
    "force networks in a dense granular packing play the role of the cytoskeleton in a living cell , thus determining its mechanical response and stability .",
    "they are also at the core of several important properties of granular media such as friction and wear @xcite , sound transmission @xcite , or even electrical transport @xcite .    internal stress and contact forces can be determined experimentally , using for example photo - elastic materials , which exhibit stress - induced birefringence .",
    "the results obtained from birefringent packings confirm that large forces seem to indeed concentrate along branching - like paths , i.e. force chains or arches .",
    "following some of these measurements , it was argued that a close inspection of contact force properties ( for instance , the shape of force probability distributions ) could provide new insights regarding the jamming - yielding transition in granular matter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the distribution of forces alone does not describe the rich topological features observed in experiments nor their potential physical consequences , and complementary methods are thus required for their analysis .    the force network in a granular system is usually defined by the contacts exerted between pairs of particles in the bulk of the system , in such a way that ,",
    "if particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in contact , they mutually exert a symmetric force @xmath4 that can also include elastic and/or friction interactions .",
    "we can represent these pairwise interactions in terms of a graph or network @xcite , in which vertices represent the particles , and two vertices are joined by an edge if the respective particles are in contact .",
    "this force network can be further characterized as a weighted network , in which each edge has assigned a real value @xmath4 , representing the actual value of the force exerted by the vertices ( the particles ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the ends of the edge .",
    "recently , ostojic _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a novel way to obtain information about the structure of force networks in static granular matter .",
    "the method is formulated in analogy with percolation theory @xcite and is based on the scaling properties of clusters of particles connected by relatively large forces . since each edge carries a force @xmath4 , a natural way to visualize the paths that carry the largest weight ( arches )",
    "is to consider only those edges with a force larger than a given threshold @xmath0 , @xmath5 , deleting those with @xmath6 . for small values of @xmath0 ,",
    "essentially all forces remain in the system , and they form a connected network with a single cluster encompassing all the particles in the system . upon increasing the value of @xmath0 , the network is expected to break down in subnetworks of connected forces , each representing a path of large weight .",
    "each one of these subnetworks can be understood in terms of clusters in a percolation problem @xcite . by analogy with the standard percolation transition , one expects to find a critical percolation threshold @xmath1 , such that for @xmath7 the force network is fragmented into a large number of small clusters , while for @xmath8 a large spanning cluster develops , reaching the boundaries of the system .",
    "this analogy with a percolation transition makes it possible to characterize complex contact force networks in terms of a reduced number of critical exponents @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the percolation transition in contact force networks was first studied by applying a finite - size scaling ( fss ) @xcite data collapse technique .",
    "this technique allows to estimate the value of the percolation threshold @xmath1 as well as some exponents related to the divergence of the average cluster size in the infinite network size limit .",
    "the remarkable conclusion of this work is that different isotropic models of a dense granular packing seem to exhibit similar percolation exponent values , independently of their microscopic details .",
    "thus these exponents appear to define a robust new universality class for contact force networks , a class which , on the other hand , is different from that of standard percolation .",
    "many real granular systems , however , are strongly anisotropic ; for example , sand piles and silos are driven by the action of gravity , and have therefore a preferred ( downwards ) direction .",
    "the presence of anisotropy should in these other cases be naturally reflected in the contact force network percolation transition , making it in principle more akin to the anisotropic counterpart of percolation , namely directed percolation @xcite .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) it was observed that anisotropic packing models indeed exhibit a different scaling in their force network percolation transition .",
    "the results in refs .",
    "@xcite however , were based in the application of an intrinsically isotropic formalism to an anisotropic system , not taking into account , for example , that correlation lengths along different directions might scale differently .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to fill in this gap , presenting a detailed study of the force network percolation transition in an anisotropic system , performing a direct anisotropic scaling analysis .",
    "we focus on the q - model @xcite , a toy granular model intended to represent the behavior of silos , having a clearly defined preferred direction , in which the weight of the particles is transmitted by virtue of gravity . performing a detailed fss numerical analysis",
    "we uncover the anisotropic nature of this model , which shows up mainly in the presence of two correlation lengths , with different scaling behavior near the percolation threshold .",
    "our numerical simulations allow us to determine a number of critical exponents , which we compare with those of directed percolation .",
    "the quantitative differences observed in the exponents clearly indicate that the contact force network percolation transition in granular systems with a preferred direction belongs to a new anisotropic universality class , which we fully characterize in terms of its critical exponents .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : q - model ] we briefly review the definition of the q - model used in our study .",
    "section  [ sec : anis - perc - analys ] describes the main elements of the fss theory for anisotropic systems .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in section  [ sec : computer - simulations ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc - concl ] we summarize our results and present our conclusions and perspectives .",
    "the q - model @xcite is defined on a tilted two - dimensional square lattice , whose sites are labeled by two integer numbers , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , giving its vertical and horizontal position , respectively .",
    "each site in the row @xmath12 supports the weight of its two nearest neighbors in the immediate upper row @xmath13 .",
    "simultaneously , its own total weight is distributed between its two nearest downward neighbors located in row @xmath14 .",
    "the transmission of weight from one row to the next is thus given by the equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the constant weight contributed by each single site , @xmath17 is a constant pressure downwards applied at the topmost row , and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , are uniformly distributed random numbers between zero and one , restricted by the mass conservation condition @xmath20 .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) determines the set of weights @xmath21 corresponding to an equilibrium configuration , as well as the corresponding force network .",
    "for instance , the relative forces between a particle at @xmath9 and its upward neighbors @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 .    in the following",
    "we will consider the q - model defined on a lattice with periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath24 axis @xcite , with massless particles @xmath25 and constant @xmath17 . in this case , a system of linear dimensions @xmath26 and @xmath27 contains @xmath28 particles , each row bears an average constant weight per particle @xmath17 , i.e. no weight is lost at the system boundaries , and the average force between particles is @xmath29 .",
    "obviously , the pressure @xmath17 is just a rescaling factor in all forces , so we set it equal to one , without loss of generality .",
    "in this section we review the fss theory needed to analyze the force network percolation transition in an anisotropic system such as the scalar q - model .",
    "let is first consider the isotropic case , in which there is a single correlation length @xmath30 , diverging as @xmath31 as a function of the distance to the percolation threshold @xmath32 .",
    "information about the position of the critical point and exponent values can be obtained by studying the normalized cluster number @xmath33 , defined as the number of clusters of size @xmath34 per lattice site @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we define the average cluster size ( or susceptibility ) @xmath35 in an infinite system , and close to the percolation threshold , the susceptibility diverges as @xmath36 . in a finite system of length @xmath37 ,",
    "the fss hypothesis @xcite states that the only relevant length scale is @xmath30 , and that the system size dependence can only enter through the ratio @xmath38 .",
    "thus , at finite @xmath37 the susceptibility scales as @xmath39 where @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "thus , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 would grow as a pure power law with @xmath37 , while for @xmath46 it would deviate from the power law behavior and saturate to a constant value for sufficiently large @xmath37 .",
    "an estimate of @xmath1 can be obtained as the the one yielding the best power law fit to @xmath47 as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "once @xmath1 is determined , a linear regression provides an estimate of the exponent ratio @xmath48 .",
    "additional exponents ( and exponent relations ) can be computed from a closer examination of the normalized cluster number .",
    "in fact , close to the percolation threshold , the normalized cluster number scales as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a critical exponent giving the characteristic cluster size , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is a universal function , independent of @xmath34 and @xmath53 . substituting @xmath54 , and defining the fractal dimension @xmath55 as @xmath56 , one obtains @xmath57 .",
    "right at the percolation threshold , in a system of finite size @xmath37 , the cluster number will scale as @xmath58 and , from eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) , and comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , we obtain the scaling relation @xmath59    the critical point and some critical exponents can also be estimated by means of a bisection method @xcite .",
    "consider a random realization of a force network with size @xmath37 and an initial guess for the percolation threshold @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the maximum force present in the network .",
    "we can estimate the true percolation threshold by an iterative procedure . in any step with a guess value @xmath62 , we check whether a percolating ( spanning ) cluster exists or not .",
    "if it does , we increase the threshold by @xmath63 ; otherwise we decrease it as @xmath64 . iterating this scheme a sufficient number of times , we compute the percolation threshold for a given network realization . averaging over many random networks",
    ", we can obtain an estimate of the threshold @xmath65 for the system size considered .",
    "the fluctuations of this estimate , @xmath66^{1/2}$ ] , as a function of @xmath37 , yields the value of the correlation exponent , @xmath67 while the percolation threshold can be obtained from the average value as @xmath68    in anisotropic systems , the fss theory takes a slightly more complex form .",
    "the length of a typical cluster is now given by the correlation lengths along the longitudinal ( downwards ) and transverse directions , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , that scale as @xmath71 where the exponents @xmath72 and @xmath73 are , in principle , different .",
    "the anisotropy exponent , measuring the differente scaling of both correlation lengths , is defined as the ratio @xmath74 in finite size simulations , two different length scales are thus present , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "varying them independently would lead to an uncontrolled scaling of the relevant functions .",
    "a proper analysis @xcite shows , however , that when the longitudinal and perpendicular lengths are related by the constraint @xcite @xmath75 the system behaves as if effectively isotropic , and standard fss applies in terms of a single length scale .",
    "this fact suggest an efficient way to compute the critical percolation exponents by performing numerical simulations for systems with freely varing @xmath76 , and fixed @xmath77 . with now a single characteristic length , the percolation threshold and the exponent ratio @xmath78 can be found by a standard fss analysis of the susceptibility , which at the critical point takes the form @xcite @xmath79 analogously , the normalized cluster number will take the form @xmath80 where the exponent @xmath81 will satisfy the anisotropic equivalent of eq .",

    ", they key point is to have an _ a priori _ knowledge of the anisotropy exponent @xmath88 .",
    "a numerical estimate of this exponent can be obtained using the fact that , close to the critical point , the two correlation lengths must be related by @xmath89 .",

    "our method for estimating exponents is however more accurate and systematic , being at the same time capable of providing new exponents , not considered previously .",
    "this is specially evident for the exponent @xmath148 quoted in @xcite , which is not discerning between the parallel and perpendicular directions .",
    "the main conclusion extracted from the analysis of these exponents is that , at least in two dimensions , the percolation transition in the contact force network of anisotropic granular matter belongs to a universality class different from either anisotropic contact force networks and isotropic percolation .",
    "it is noteworthy that the change of universality goes thus beyond the simple presence of a preferred direction , as we can see from the comparison of the q - model exponents with those of directed percolation .",
    "even though some exponents are similar , such as @xmath149 or @xmath81 , others are clearly different , out of the estimated error bars .",
    "the ultimate reason for this difference can be traced out in the presence of force correlations or arches @xcite .",
    "the strength of these arches is enhanced in anisotropic models with a preferred direction for the propagation of weight , and explain the change in universality between different packing models .",
    "the origin of correlations is easy to understand in the present case : as we have defined it , the total force between rows is constant , imposing a global conservation law , superimposed to the local conservation of weights built in the definition of the model , eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "global conservation prevents dissipation of stresses , and as a consequence any local build up of forces will propagate downwards unchecked and lead to the creation of arches in which strong forces are preferably connected to one another .",
    "the strong anisotropy and correlations in the force network of the q - model are checked in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdist ] , where we plot the variance of the force distribution , computed at different heights @xmath12 , and which shows a marked dependence on this variable . in the case forces",
    "were uncorrelated at different @xmath12 levels , and considering that forces are exponentially distributed @xcite , the variance should take the form @xmath150 , clearly smaller than the numerically computed values .",
    "on the other hand , correlations between nearest neighbors are checked in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fdist ] , where we plot the average value @xmath151 of the forces connected to a given bond of force @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "as we can see , this average value grows almost linearly with @xmath0 , while in absence of correlations it should be equal to the average force @xmath152 .",
    "we conclude therefore that force networks in granular matter define different universality classes , depending on the symmetries imposed on the systems , universality classes that bear no resemblance with the corresponding ones in standard percolation , and are strongly affected by the strength of correlations in the overall force network structure .",
