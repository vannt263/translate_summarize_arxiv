    "quantum cascade ( qc ) structures are semiconductor heterostructures grown with a complicated sequence of alternating layers of different semiconductor materials and with varying thicknesses .",
    "this sequence of layers is repeated many times , up to tens or even over a hundred periods .",
    "figure  [ fig.qcstructure ] shows an example of the conduction - band line - up in a qc structure .",
    "these structures form the basis of a new type of semiconductor laser,@xcite in which the laser light emission occurs through intersubband or interminiband transitions ( in most cases within the conduction band ) rather than interband transitions .",
    "these lasers have a great variety of designs , and a recent review is given in ref .  .",
    "until recently,@xcite all quantum cascade laser ( qcl ) structures were designed so that each period in the structure contains an active region in which the lasing transition occurs , and a separate injector region .",
    "the injector acts as a reservoir of electrons for injection into the active region of the next stage .",
    "it also acts as a collector of electrons from the preceding active region .",
    "the direction of the electron flow is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig.qcstructure ] , and the electron flow is seen to resemble a cascade as the electrons move from one stage to the next when a bias is applied .",
    "hence , the electron transport through a qcl structure is a complicated interplay between relaxation through light emission and scattering in the active region , and transmission through tunneling and scattering in the injector region.@xcite    initially , most theoretical investigations@xcite of transport in qc structures have focused on the role played by scattering processes in determining transport properties and the dynamics of the electron distributions in these structures .",
    "very recently , however , the first theoretical investigations of quantum transport in these structures which have considered or incorporated quantum effects beyond a boltzmann equation approach have been reported.@xcitea theoretical study of quantum transport may be treated using the density matrix formalism,@xcite or with a nonequilibrium green s function ( ngf ) approach.@xcite    in the work reported here , we extend the ngf theory described in ref .   to the study of quantum transport in qc structures .",
    "very early results from this investigation have been reported in refs .   and .",
    "in this paper , we present further and more detailed results from this study . in addition , we have extended the work further to the problem of evaluating the gain or absorption spectra of these structures,@xcite and we also report and discuss results of this work here .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe the theoretical formulation that we use to derive the transport properties , and then the linear optical response of qc structures . in sec .",
    "[ sec.results ] , we apply this theory to example qc structures , and describe the results obtained .",
    "the last section contains a summary and conclusion .",
    "we model the qc structure as a periodic superlattice structure , in which each period contains @xmath0 semiconductor layers with varying thicknesses .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 which we use to model this system may be separated into two parts : @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 contains the superlattice potential and a static electric field @xmath4 applied in the growth direction , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath6 describes the scattering processes included in the theory .",
    "the hamiltonian is expressed in a set of basis states , @xmath7 , which we assume separable , although this is an approximation when the effective mass is position dependent . in the plane of the semiconductor layers ,",
    "the basis functions behave as plane waves .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath8 is the sample area in this plane .",
    "the position vector @xmath9 and in - plane wave vector * k * are two - dimensional ( 2d ) vectors . in the growth direction , here labeled @xmath10 , there are several possible choices ( see ref . for a discussion ) for the functions @xmath11 .",
    "although the physical results obtained from the theory should be independent of the specific choice of these functions , there are different advantages or drawbacks attached to a given choice . for instance , as we discuss next , one choice may be more suited to expediting the numerical computation , while another choice may more easily allow the extraction of physical information in a form that can be compared with experimental measurements .",
    "possible choices are ( i ) bloch functions which are eigenstates of the bare superlattice potential @xmath12 , and are spatially extended across the whole structure .",
    "( ii ) wannier - stark states which are eigenstates of @xmath3 , i.e. , of the superlattice potential and the applied bias .",
    "these eigenstates are metastable@xcite ( non - hermitian ) with complex energies .",
    "they are often treated approximately as stationary states ( their metastable nature is neglected ) , and this leads to an ambiguity in the definition of these states depending on how this approximation is made .",
    "( iii ) wannier functions , which should not be confused with wannier - stark functions , may be constructed so that they are spatially well localized . in particular , they may be constructed as eigenstates of the position operator . in symmetric",
    "superlattice structures , these eigenstates are maximally localized.@xcite the spatial localization of the wannier states enables one to setup a picture of transport in which scattering occurs from one spatial region of the structure to another .",
    "the wannier functions do not depend on bias , and this is computationally advantageous since coupling matrix elements between wannier functions may be calculated only once at zero bias , and the same matrix elements may then be used at any applied bias . for these reasons ,",
    "the theory presented here is formulated in the wannier function basis ( see appendix [ app.basis ] ) , which we derive as eigenstates of the position operator .",
    "a disadvantage in using this basis is that the wannier functions are not energy eigenstates of the structure , and it is therefore difficult to obtain a physical interpretation in the energy picture or domain .",
    "for instance , there is no one - to - one correspondence between an optical transition in the structure and a transition between a pair of wannier functions .",
    "this difficulty may be partially circumvented , however , at a later stage in the calculation , by transforming the results obtained into the wannier - stark basis .",
    "we emphasize again that the basis choice is not in itself an important issue , i.e. , the physical content of the theory should not depend on this choice , but a suitable choice of basis can facilitate the numerical computation ( e.g. , wannier states ) , or more easily allow physical interpretation ( e.g. , wannier - stark states ) .    expressing the hamiltonian in the wannier basis we obtain @xmath13 , \\label{eq.hsl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath14 labels a period in the superlattice , and the index @xmath15 labels a wannier function @xmath16 within a period . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are creation and annihilation operators for an electron with in - plane wave vector * k * , and spin index @xmath19 , in the @xmath15th wannier level , in period @xmath14 .",

    "the population in the upper laser level , however , changes from around 0.2% at 0.1 v / period to over 10% at 0.22 v / period .",
