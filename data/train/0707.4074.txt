    "massive stars are a driving force of physical and chemical evolutions of their host galaxies .",
    "supernova explosions and their remnants have been intensively studied for decades , but the pre - explosion effects are equally important ; the integrated mass , momentum , and energy releases over the lifetime of an o star can be comparable to those by a supernova explosion at the end of their lives @xcite .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is generated as a consequence of shocks by stellar winds impinging on the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "therefore , we can quantitatively study the effects of energy dissipation and the chemical enrichment of interstellar space by early - type stars through the spectroscopy of x - ray emission in h regions .",
    "@xcite presented a self - similar solution of stellar winds interacting with the ism .",
    "they showed a single o7 star forms a hot ( @xmath110@xmath3  k ) bubble by the shock , which can be observed as soft extended ( @xmath110  pc ) x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite claimed the first unambiguous detections of such emission in the h regions m17 and the rosette nebula using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) onboard the chandra x - ray observatory @xcite . with a @xmath140  ks integration time of m17 ( obsid@xmath4972 ) ,",
    "diffuse soft x - ray emission was detected apart from 886 point sources above @xmath110@xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed the entire structure of the soft x - ray diffuse emission using the position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; @xcite ) onboard rosat @xcite .",
    "they measured the total x - ray luminosity and compared to the wind - blown bubble models with and without heat conduction .",
    "they concluded that only the bubble without heat conduction can account for the observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath7  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic field may be responsible for suppressing the heat conduction and mass evaporation between the hot gas and cold ism @xcite .",
    "the results obtained by these high - resolution imaging studies are generally consistent with the wind - blown bubble models",
    ". however , the observational results are not still accurate enough to compare to the theoretical works .",
    "it is often ambiguous whether the observed diffuse emission is from wind - blown bubbles or from supernovae , which give rise to diffuse emission with a similar x - ray spectral hardness and luminosity in a similar spatial scale .",
    "the largest uncertainty stems from the lack of spectral analysis based on line diagnostics in a spatially - resolved manner .",
    "resolving emission lines is crucial to examine whether the spectrum is thermal and to determine the temperature and the chemical composition of the plasma .",
    "for example , the intensity ratio of k@xmath0 lines between o and o and that between ne and ne are steep functions of the plasma temperature at 110  mk @xcite . in between the o and ne k@xmath0 complex , fe l series lines dominate the spectrum .",
    "the metallicity of these elements is one of the factors to determine the x - ray luminosity expected from a wind - blown bubble @xcite .",
    "the anomaly in the o and fe abundance ratio can be used to discriminate different types of supernovae @xcite if the emission is of a supernova origin .",
    "the previous studies using rosat and chandra were incapable of resolving these lines , limiting their ability to diagnose the plasma emission .    the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) onboard suzaku @xcite has a superior spectral resolution , a low background , and a large effective area , which are particularly suited for spectroscopy of extended x - ray emission .",
    "the capability to resolve key elements with sufficient statistical significance has been illustrated by several initial studies on extended emission in h regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite resolved various emission lines from the diffuse emission in the carina nebula .",
    "based on the low nitrogen - to - oxygen ratio and the spatial variation of the fe and si abundances , they suggested that the diffuse emission originates not from wind - blown bubbles but from one or multiple old supernova remnant(s ) .",
    "m17 is a galactic h region at a distance of @xmath11.6  kpc @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified nine o stars in the central ob association with near infrared spectroscopy",
    ". a much larger number of young ob stars are suggested by near infrared photometry @xcite .",
    "the earliest system is a binary of two o4o5 stars .",
    "the age of the cluster is estimated to be @xmath81  myr based on the h - r diagram @xcite .",
    "strong winds and radiation from the central ob association sculpted the ambient matter to form a -shaped cloud , which was traced by molecular and atomic hydrogen lines @xcite .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission found by chandra and rosat has an asymmetric morphology with respect to the ob association and fills the cavity of the molecular cloud toward the negative galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "m17 is suitable for x - ray studies of hot bubbles in h regions for being proximate and having a very high contrast of the diffuse emission against point sources . from the chandra study @xcite",
    ", the diffuse emission is more intense than the integrated emission of resolved point sources by more than ten - fold at 1  kev . despite the limited spatial resolution of suzaku ,",
    "therefore , the obtained spectrum is not seriously contaminated by unresolved point sources .",
    "suzaku observed m17 on 2006 march 1114 in the first announcement of opportunity observing cycle .",
    "suzaku has xis and hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) instruments .",
    "we concentrate on the xis data in this paper , which has a sensitivity for the soft emission studied here .",
    "the xis is equipped with four x - ray ccds .",
    "three of them ( xis0 , 2 , and 3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds and the remaining one ( xis1 ) is a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "each ccd chip has a format of 1024@xmath91024 pixels and is composed of four segments of 256@xmath91024 pixels .",
    "fi and bi ccds are superior to each other in the hard and soft band responses , respectively .",
    "they are mounted at the focus of four independent x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; @xcite ) .",
    "the detectors are sensitive in the energy range of 0.212.0  kev with an initial energy resolution of @xmath165  ev in the full width at half maximum and a total effective area of @xmath11360  @xmath10 at 1.5  kev .",
    "an xis field of view covers a @xmath118@xmath918  region with a half power diameter of @xmath12 .",
    "the radioactive sources of illuminate two corners of each of the four ccds for calibration purposes .",
    "the performance of xis is subject to degradation due to the radiation damage in the orbit @xcite . as of the observation date ,",
    "the energy resolution in the full width at half maximum is @xmath190  ev at 1.5  kev .",
    "the relative energy gains among xis chips and segments have a systematic uncertainty of @xmath15  ev .",
    "an unknown contaminant accumulates on the optical blocking filters of the xis in the orbit . as a result ,",
    "the effective area at the soft band end has diminished significantly , making the carbon and nitrogen features difficult to detect below @xmath10.5  kev .",
    "this effect is included in the auxiliary response .",
    "the observation was conducted using the normal clocking mode with a frame time of 8  s. data ( revision 1.2 ) were screened to remove events during the south atlantic anomaly passages , at elevation angles below 4@xmath11 from the earth rim , and at elevation angles below 10@xmath11 from sunlit earth rim .",
    "we constructed plots of the raw count rate versus the elevation angles to find that these criteria maximize the exposure time with negligible contaminating emission .",

    "the two band - limited images appear strikingly different . in the hard band ,",

    "the o8 star @xcite is bright , isolated , and point - like in the acis image ( cxouj182035.87161542.5 ; @xcite ) , thus serves as a good astrometric calibrator .",
    "we shifted the xis frame by @xmath117  to the north so that the position matches with that by the acis observation .",
    "the chandra frame is accurate to @xmath105 in the astrometry .",
    "we first examine the spectrum of the entire diffuse emission .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum from a rectangular region and the background spectrum from a region devoid of intense diffuse emission ( figure  [ fg : f1]a ) .",
    "because the off - axis angles of the source and background regions are different , we processed the raw spectra in the following way before subtracting the background from the source : ( 1 ) the non  x - ray - background ( nxb ) spectrum was subtracted , which was constructed from night earth data at the same extraction region .",
    "the nxb of xis is a function of the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity .",
    "we therefore compiled night earth observations such that the cut - off rigidity distribution becomes the same with that of the m17 observation .",
    "( 2 ) the vignetting was corrected by multiplying the effective area ratios between the source and background regions for each energy bin of the background spectrum .",
    "this takes into account the accumulating contaminant on the xis optical blocking filter .",
    "the merged fi and the bi spectra are shown in figure [ fg : f2 ] .",
    "in the merged fi spectrum , we added the three fi spectra to increase the photon statistics , because the redistribution matrix functions ( rmfs ) and the auxiliary response functions ( arfs ) are essentially the same for these chips . on the other hand , we handled the bi spectrum separately for its different response .",
    "( 85mm,85mm)f2.eps    we resolved the emission lines clearly for the first time , which include k shell lines of o , ne , and mg as well as l shell lines of fe .",
    "this indicates that the emission is of a thermal origin .",
    "the o line is much stronger than the o line and the ne line is so than the ne line if we taking the energy dependence of the efficiencies into account .",
    "these line ratios alone infer that the plasma temperature is in the range of 2.54  mk @xcite even without spectral model fittings .      in order to investigate the spatial difference of the plasma properties",
    ", we divided the source region into three sub - regions ( a , b , and c in figure [ fg : f1]a ) based on the morphology of the diffuse emission .",

    "the metallicity of the diffuse emission is 0.10.3 solar ( table  [ tb : t1 ] ) , which is significantly lower than those derived for the discrete sources ( 0.31.5 solar ) .",
    "the metal abundances relative to each other in the diffuse emission are consistent with solar among o , mg , and fe @xcite , but ne is enhanced in all three sub - regions by a factor of @xmath12 ( table  [ tb : t1 ] ) .",
    "this is also evident in the simultaneous spectral fits of the three sub - regions , in which we tied the abundance values of these elements .",
    "the resultant values are @xmath60  0.12 ( 0.110.13 ) , @xmath61  0.22 ( 0.210.25 ) , @xmath62  0.10 ( 0.080.12 ) , and @xmath63  0.12 ( 0.110.13 ) solar .",
    "such ne enhancement from other metals is widely seen in coronally active stars @xcite for unknown reasons .",
    "we consider that the ne enhancement is an intrinsic feature of the diffuse plasma , and is not influenced by the contamination of ne - enhanced point sources spectra (   [ sect : s4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "one explanation for the anomaly is that the poorly - constrained solar ne abundance is underestimated by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "this would account for the observed ne enhancement in the m17 diffuse plasma as well .",
    "the lack of a clear spatial variation of the chemical composition comprises a sharp contrast to the diffuse emission in the carina nebula @xcite , where the different abundance patterns across a similar spatial scale suggest the supernova origin for the emission . in the diffuse emission in m17 ,",
    "the o and fe ratio is consistent with the solar abundance , which is another line of evidence against the supernova interpretation .",
    "if a supernova has occurred in m17 , it should have been caused by a star earlier than the earliest ( o4o5 ) star in the ob association .",
    "such a massive source causes a core - collapse  type supernova .",
    "it would have yielded a measurably larger ratio of o against fe than the solar value by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "we conducted a spectroscopic study of the soft diffuse x - ray emission in m17 using the xis onboard suzaku .",
    "high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of the diffuse emission were obtained in a spatially - resolved manner .",
    "half a dozen of emission lines were resolved clearly for the first time , which include k@xmath0 lines from highly ionized o , ne , and mg and l lines from fe .",
    "these lines are clear evidence for the thermal origin of the diffuse emission .",
    "based on the chandra data of an overlapping field and on the previous works in the literature , we confirmed that the background - subtracted diffuse spectrum by xis is barely contaminated by unresolved point sources , grxe , cxb , and lhb emission .",
    "we showed that the diffuse spectra are explained by a single temperature plasma model of @xmath45  0.25  kev , @xmath64  3.5@xmath910@xmath24  erg  s@xmath6 ( 0.52.0  kev ) , and @xmath464.5@xmath910@xmath20  @xmath21 .",
    "the temperature and the chemical composition of the diffuse plasma is spatially uniform , indicating that the plasma is at a thermal equilibrium .",
    "the apparent difference in the surface brightness is probably due to the difference in the line - of - sight depth or in the filling factors , and not in the plasma density .",
    "the abundance is obtained individually for the detected elements , which are consistent with 0.10.3  solar values .",
    "the enhancement of ne against other metals by a factor of @xmath12 is seen in the diffuse plasma , which may be explained by a upward revision of the solar ne abundance .",
    "the lack of spatial variations in the chemical composition comprises a sharp contrast to the diffuse emission in the carina nebula , where different abundance patterns across a similar spatial scale suggest the supernova origin for the emission .",
    "together with the o to fe ratio consistent with the solar value , this gives evidence against the interpretation that a supernova is the cause of the diffuse emission observed in m17 .",
