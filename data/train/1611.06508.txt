    "it is very challenging and beyond the scope of this work to take into account all these considerations by obtaining a population - dependent , three - dimensional extinction map with high angular resolution .",

    "@xcite report the discovery of abundant embedded star clusters in molecular clouds .",
    "the size distribution of the embedded clusters spans the range of 0.252.25  pc with a peak at @xmath01.1  pc , very different from ours . through their visual inspections",
    ", they preferentially identified small and compact cluster candidates , which have high contrast of stellar surface density with respect to their surrounding areas . the group identification algorithm used in this work , however , does not introduce a preferential scale and reveals star groups over a continuous range of sizes .",
    "on the other hand , as mentioned above , the star groups identified with the relatively rare ums stars are incomplete below @xmath43  =  8  pc .",
    "thus , @xcite and this work focus on different subsections of the full hierarchy of young stellar structures .",
    "@xcite investigated the size distributions of star clusters and  non - clusters \" which are essentially nebular complexes and stellar associations .",
    "the former class has a steeper distribution , and the latter has a shallower distribution than ours .",
    "their results are different from ours owing to two reasons .",
    "first , they have treated the two classes separately , while we do not try to distinguish star clusters , associations , or larger stellar structures .",
    "second , they have used the catalog of extended objects of @xcite , which in turn was compiled from many previous works .",
    "thus the effect of selection bias is hard to assess .",
    "in this work we investigate the hierarchical stellar structures of the 30  dor - n158-n159-n160 star - forming complex traced by young ums stars observed with the vmc survey .",
    "we calculate the surface densities of the ums stars , whose values cover two orders of magnitudes .",
    "we identify groups of ums stars on different levels of critical surface densities .",
    "the larger - sized groups on lower levels often contain several smaller - sized ones on higher levels , and a high degree of sub - grouping is revealed by the dendrograms constructed to show the",
    "child \" relations between the groups on different levels .",
    "the stellar groups have sizes ranging continuously from several parsecs to more than 100  pc . without characteristic sizes ,",
    "the stellar groups have a power - law cumulative size distribution , with the power - law index indicating a projected fractal dimension @xmath6  =  1.6  @xmath7  0.3 .",
    "we suggest that the cumulative size distribution of the ums stars is related to their parental ism in a scenario of hierarchical star formation , in which newly - born stars follow the gas distribution .",
    "the projected fractal dimension derived here is close to those reported for other star - forming regions as well as for several galaxies ; the difference with respect to some other galaxies is also discussed .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for the detailed and constructive comments on this paper .",
    "the analysis in this article is based on observations collected at the european organisation for astronomical research in the southern hemisphere ( eso ) under eso program 179.b-2003 .",
