    "the complex scaling method  @xcite invented in early 70-s remains one of the most effective approaches to calculation of resonances in few - body systems .",
    "this method is applicable to an @xmath0-body problem in the case where inter - particle interaction potentials are analytic functions of coordinates .",
    "the complex scaling gives a possibility to rotate the continuous spectrum of an @xmath0-body hamiltonian in such a way that certain sectors of unphysical sheets neighboring the physical one turn into a part of the physical sheet for the resulting non - selfadjoint operator .",
    "resonances appear to be complex eigenvalues of this operator @xcite while the binding energies stay fixed during the scaling transformations .",
    "therefore , when searching for the resonances within the complex scaling approach one may apply the methods which are usually employed to locate the binding energies",
    ". some reviews of the literature on the complex scaling and its many applications can be found , in particular , in  @xcite .",
    "here we only mention that there is a rigorous mathematical proof @xcite that for a rather wide class of interaction potentials the resonances given by the complex scaling method coincide with the `` true scattering resonances '' , i.e. the poles of the analytically continued scattering matrix in the unphysical sheets .    along with the complex scaling ,",
    "various different methods are also used for calculations of the resonances . among the methods developed to calculate directly the scattering - matrix resonances we ,",
    "first , mention the approach based on the momentum space faddeev integral equations  @xcite ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) . in this approach one",
    "numerically solves the equations continued into an unphysical sheet and , thus , the three - body resonances arise as the poles of the continued t - matrix .",
    "another approach to calculation of the scattering - matrix resonances is based on the explicit representations @xcite for the analytically continued t- and s - matrices in terms of the physical sheet . from these representations",
    "one infers that the three - body resonances can be found as zeros of certain truncations of the scattering matrix only taken in the physical sheet .",
    "such an approach can be employed even in the coordinate space @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "there are no published works applying the complex scaling to the faddeev equations .",
    "therefore , we consider the present investigation as a first attempt undertaken in this direction .",
    "however , the purpose of our work is rather two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", we make the complex scaling of the faddeev differential equations . on the other hand",
    "we compare the complex scaling method with the scattering - matrix approach suggested in @xcite .",
    "we do this making use of both the approaches to examine resonances in a model system of three bosons having the nucleon masses and in the three - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) system itself .",
    "first , we recall that , after the scaling transformation , the three - body schrdinger operator reads as follows  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scaling parameter with @xmath4 .",
    "by @xmath5 we understand the six  dimensional laplacian in @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the standard jacobi variables , @xmath8 .",
    "notation @xmath9 is used for the two - body potentials which are assumed to depend on @xmath10 but not on @xmath11 .    the corresponding scaled faddeev equations which we solve read @xmath12 \\phi^{(\\alpha)}(z;x)+ v_\\alpha({{\\rm e}}^\\vartheta",

    "explicit expression for the geometric function @xmath26 can be found , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "the partial - wave equations  ( [ fadpartcor ] ) are supplied with the boundary conditions @xmath27 for compactly supported inhomogeneous terms @xmath28 the partial - wave faddeev component @xmath29 also satisfies the asymptotic condition @xmath30 \\\\          & + &   \\displaystyle\\frac{\\exp({\\rm i }   \\sqrt{z}\\,\\,{{{\\rm e}}^{{{\\rm i}}\\theta}}\\rho)}{\\sqrt{\\rho } }   \\left[a_l(z;y / x)+o\\left(\\rho^{-1/2}\\right)\\right ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ] for simplicity it is assumed in this formula that the two - boson subsystem has only one bound state with the energy @xmath31 , and @xmath32 represents its wave function .",

    ", we understand the main ( arithmetic ) branch of the function @xmath40 .    in the scaling method a resonance",

    "the latter operator is just the operator constituted by the l.h.s .",
    "parts of eqs .",
    "( [ faddinhom ] ) .",
    "the resonance energies should not , of course , depend on the scaling parameter @xmath44 and on the choice of the terms @xmath28 .",
    "in the scattering - matrix approach we solve the same partial - wave faddeev equations ( [ fadpartcor ] ) with the same boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) and ( [ hebs ] ) but for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the resonances are looked for as zeroes of the truncated scattering - matrix ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath47 , where the @xmath48 elastic scattering amplitude @xmath49 for complex energies @xmath41 in the physical sheet is extracted from the asymptotics ( [ hebs ] ) .",
    "for numerical solution of the boundary - value problem ( [ fadpartcor][hebs ] ) we employ its finite - difference approximation in the hyperradius - hyperangle coordinates .",
    "a detail description of the finite - difference algorithm used can be found in ref .",
    "in the table we present our results obtained for a complex - scaling resonance in the model three - body system which consists of identical bosons having the nucleon mass . to describe interaction between them",

    "the figures in the table correspond to the roots of the inverse function @xmath57^{-1}$ ] for @xmath16 and @xmath58 only taken into account . in the present calculation",
    "we have taken up to 400 knots in both hyperradius and hyperangle variables while for the cut - off hyperradius we take 40fm .",
    "one observes from the table that the position of the resonance depends very weakly on the scaling parameter @xmath44 which confirms a good numerical quality of our results .",
    "we compare the resonance values of the table to the resonance value @xmath59mev obtained for the same three - boson system with exactly the same potentials but in the completely different scattering - matrix approach of ref .",
    "we see that , indeed , both the complex scaling and the scattering matrix approaches give the same result .",
    "we also watched the trajectory of the above resonance when the barrier amplitude @xmath60 varied ( see .",
    "[ fig - trajectory1 ] ) . while the complex scaling method was applicable it gave practically the same positions for the resonance . for the barrier",
    "amplitudes @xmath60 smaller than 1.0 only the scattering - matrix approach allows to locate the resonance ( which finally , for @xmath61 , turns into a virtual level ) .    as to the @xmath1 system in the @xmath62state where we employed the mti ",
    "iii @xcite potential model , both the methods applied give no resonances on the two - body unphysical sheet ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we have found no resonances in the part of the three - body sheet accessible via the complex scaling method .",
    "thus , at least in the framework of the mti ",
    "iii model we can not confirm the experimental result of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the point @xmath63mev was interpreted as a resonance corresponding to an exited state of the triton @xmath64h .",
    "the triton virtual state can be only calculated within the scattering - matrix method but not in the scaling approach .",
    "our present improved scattering - matrix result for the triton virtual state is @xmath65mev ( i.e. the virtual level lies 0.47mev below the two - body threshold ) .",
    "this result has been obtained with the mti - iii potential on a grid having 1000 knots in both hyperradial and hyperradial variables and with the value of cut - off hyperradius equal to 120fm .",
    "notice that some values for the virtual - state energy obtained by different authors can be found in  @xcite and all of these values are about 0.5mev below the two - body threshold ."
