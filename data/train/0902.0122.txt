    "the giant elliptical galaxy ngc  5128 hosts the powerful central radio continuum source cen  a and contains significant amount of gas and dust projected in front of it .",
    "it is therefore a good target for absorption study .",
    "it was the first radio galaxy in which absorption in neutral hydrogen was detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "since then , numerous molecules have been detected in absorption toward cen a as well , first at radio wavelengths , such as h@xmath10co ( @xcite ) , c@xmath11h@xmath10 ( @xcite ) , oh , nh@xmath11 ( @xcite ) , and further at millimeter wavelengths with the swedish - eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ) : co , hco@xmath0 , hcn , hnc , cn , cs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular absorption profile is best revealed from the hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) spectrum published by @xcite , owing to the large opacity of the transition , and to the high signal to noise and good spectral resolution of the data .",
    "the hco@xmath0(1 - 0 ) absorption profile can be mainly decomposed into two components : _",
    "i ) _ a series of narrow ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath9 wide ) lines with absorption depth ranging from @xmath13% to nearly 100% of the continuum intensity , located in the heliocentric velocity range between 540 and 560 km  s@xmath9 , i.e. close to the systemic velocity , and _",
    "ii ) _ a broad absorption feature between 560 and 640 km  s@xmath9 , of @xmath14% of the continuum , also including several narrow components ( 10 to 50% of the continuum ) . following @xcite",
    ", we will refer to these components as low velocity complex ( lvc ) and high velocity complex ( hvc ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , the hi absorption profile shows numerous narrow components , although some with no molecular counterparts , and vice versa . the estimates of the systemic velocity range between @xmath15 and 551 km  s@xmath9 in the literature ( see e.g. the review by @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of redshifted hi absorption , seen only in front of the radio core and not against the inner lobes , has been interpreted by @xcite as gas infall toward the central source .",
    "eventually , this gas infall could be sufficient to fuel a supermassive black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that a weak and broad hi absorption , previously undetected and corresponding in velocity to the molecular hvc , is occuring only in front of the nucleus .",
    "the region showing redshifted gas is limited in size to @xmath16 pc from the radio core , and is thus a strong candidate for a circumnuclear disk .",
    "new hi observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) allowed @xcite to also detect blueshifted absorption , thus favoring the interpretation in terms of a rotating circumnuclear disk .",
    "it is not clear , however , what is the illuminating background continuum source at this frequency . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that , between 2 and 5 ghz the innermost part of the radio continuum source is affected by free - free absorption that might be caused by circumnuclear ionised gas .",
    "the absorption of hard x - ray , indicating a column density of @xmath17 atoms @xmath8 of absorbing gas in front of the central source ( @xcite ) , also suggests the presence of circumnuclear material around the supermassive black hole , as expected from the agn unification models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central region of cen a is heavily obscured in the optical , with a@xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a circumnuclear molecular disk in cen a , with extent of about @xmath19 pc in radius , has been inferred by several authors ( @xcite ) on the basis of infrared and submillimeter emission data .",
    "recently , @xcite mapped the h@xmath10 2 @xmath20 m lines emission at @xmath21 resolution toward the central region with a field of view of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 pc ) .",
    "their best fit of the h@xmath10 velocity field , using a warped disk model , indicates a median disk inclination angle of @xmath24 and a black hole mass of @xmath25 m@xmath26 .",
    "the hvc absorption is significantly redshifted with respect to the systemic velocity , and spread over a larger velocity range than that of the lvc , forming , as seen in the hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) line , a broad and continuous absorption over more than 50 km  s@xmath9 wide . for these reasons ,",
    "@xcite suggest that the hvc absorption components could originate in the circumnuclear disk .",
    "the lvc components , on the other hand , may correspond to intervening gas in the galactic disk of cen a , although it is difficult to determine their locations .",
    "alternatively , @xcite proposed that the general velocity structure of the absorption could be explained kinematically with a tilted - ring model and high - altitude clouds , not necessarily requiring the presence of molecular gas close to the active nucleus .    in any case , the physical conditions of the absorbing molecular gas are still poorly known .",
    "previous analysis of co multi - transition single - dish observations were conducted ( @xcite ) , but suffer from strong contamination by line emission .",
    "the situation is better for @xmath27co , as the line emission is greatly reduced . from analysis of the @xmath27co ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) line absorption , @xcite derived volume density @xmath28(h@xmath10 ) of a few times @xmath3 @xmath4 for the narrow components in the lvc .",
    "van @xcite observed the ground state main lines of oh ( rest frequencies of 1665 and 1667 mhz ) with the atca and estimate similar gas density for lvc absorption components .",
    "interestingly , they also observed the two satellite lines at 1612 and 1720 mhz and find that these lines have a strong conjugate behavior , one in absorption , and the other equally strong in emission .",
    "this is particularly remarkable in the hvc , because the corresponding absorption is weak in the main oh lines .",
    "van @xcite note that such a behavior could occur at high density @xmath29 @xmath4 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no other molecule has been observed in different rotational transitions , and the physical properties corresponding to the hvc components are mostly unknown .    with the aim to study the properties of the gas in front of the nuclear continuum source , and particularly the dense gas component as a probe of the potential circumnuclear disk ,",
    "we have observed the high density gas tracers hco@xmath0 and hcn ( 3 - 2 ) transitions toward the center of centaurus a with the submillimeter array .",

    "the array was composed of eight antennas in a compact north - south configuration , optimized for observations of sources in the southern hemisphere .",

    "we observed cen a for a total on - source integration time of 4.3 hours .",
    "the zenith atmospheric opacity at 225 ghz was between 0.1 and 0.15 .",
    "system temperatures ranged between 200 and 600 k for the different antennas , except for one antenna , for which the system temperature was between 600 and 900 k. the data were calibrated with the software package mir / idl .",
    "the bright radio sources 3c273 , 3c279 and ganymede were observed for bandpass calibration , for which an antenna - based solution was adopted .",
    "the heterodyne receivers were tuned to observe simultaneously the hco@xmath0 and hcn ( 3 - 2 ) transitions , both placed in the lower sideband ( lsb ) .",
    "the @xmath37 ghz bandwidth of the lsb was divided into 24 spectral windows ( `` chunks '' ) , 104 mhz ( @xmath38 km  s@xmath9 ) wide each , and slightly overlapping in frequency .",
    "the continuum emission ( fig.[map]a ) was reconstructed by averaging all the lsb line - free chunks , resulting in a total spectral bandwidth of 1.6 ghz .",
    "the absorption components , especially around @xmath39 km  s@xmath9 , have narrow linewidths ( @xmath40 1 - 5 km  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "we therefore used a velocity resolution of @xmath40 0.2 km  s@xmath9 ( i.e. , 512 channels / chunk ) for the chunks corresponding to the hco@xmath0 and hcn lines .",
    "all the other chunks were set to a spectral resolution of 0.8125 mhz ( or a velocity resolution of @xmath41 km  s@xmath9 ) . to further improve the signal to noise ratio",

    "we estimate the continuum flux density of cen a to be @xmath43 jy at 266 ghz , with uncertainty of order of 20% , by using ganymede as a flux calibrator . the complex gains ( amplitude and phase _ vs _ time ) were self - calibrated on the continuum visibilities .",
    "the amplitude was normalized to the continuum level .",
    "continuum - subtracted channel maps were produced for both lines .",

    "as the jet has a steep radio spectrum , with negligible flux at millimeter wavelengths , the molecular absorption should however occur toward the radio core .",
    "@xcite measured the size of the radio core as @xmath54 mas in diameter from 43 ghz vlbi observations , corresponding to a linear dimension of @xmath55 pc , and yielding a brightness temperature on the order of @xmath56 k. the temperature of any molecular gas in the line of sight is therefore expected to be completely negligible with respect to that of the continuum . given the very small apparent size of the continuum source at millimeter wavelengths , we expect the continuum source to be completely covered by the absorbing clouds , and will assume a filling factor of unity in our analysis .",
    "this assumption is supported by vlba data of the oh 18 cm absorption , which appears to cover a large fraction the continuum source ( van @xcite ) .    in the following , we will compare our hco@xmath0 and hcn ( 3 - 2 ) data to previous observations of the corresponding ( 1 - 0 ) transitions obtained in 1995 - 1996 by @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no other observations of hco@xmath0 or hcn absorption toward cen a were attempted inbetween",

    "we have used a molecular excitation code based on the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation .",
    "molecular data for hco@xmath0 and hcn , including the energy levels , the radiative transition rates and collisional cross sections , were taken from the leiden atomic and molecular database ( @xcite ) . in our calculations ,",
    "we include all rotational levels up to the @xmath57 level .",
    "the temperature of the cosmic background radiation field is set to 2.73 k. our code need three basic parameters as inputs : the molecular hydrogen density @xmath28(h@xmath10 ) , the kinetic temperature @xmath58 and the gas column density per unit velocity @xmath5/@xmath6 .",
    "the statistical equilibrium equations setup in the framework of the lvg approximation are solved iteratively using a newton - raphson method .",
    "we consider that convergence is achieved when the relative change in level populations is less than @xmath59 between two successive iterations .",
    "we present the results of our calculations in fig.[hco ] and [ hcn ] , where the changes of excitation temperature and line opacity as a function of molecular hydrogen density are shown for the @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath1 transitions of hco@xmath0 and hcn molecules , respectively .",
    "we assume a kinetic temperature of 10 k , within the range of temperatures commonly inferred in previous studies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the column density per unit velocity is set to @xmath7 @xmath8  km@xmath9  s for hco@xmath0 , and @xmath62 @xmath8  km@xmath9  s for hcn , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with that derived by @xcite .    at low gas density , i.e. , @xmath28(h@xmath10 ) @xmath63 @xmath4 ,",
    "the hco@xmath0 molecules are not excited to high @xmath64 levels . as can be seen from fig.[hco ]",
    ", the excitation temperature is low for all transitions shown .",
    "most of the hco@xmath0 molecules stay in the @xmath65 and @xmath66 levels , resulting in high opacity for the @xmath2 and @xmath67 transitions . as the gas density increases , more hco@xmath0 molecules are excited to higher @xmath64 levels .",
    "the opacity of the @xmath2 transition drops rapidly , while the opacity of the @xmath1 transition increases at nearly the same pace .",
    "we note here the non - intuitive behaviour of the @xmath61 transition : the opacity of this transition increases slightly with density , peaking at a hydrogen density of @xmath68 @xmath4 and then falls off at higher density .",
    "the @xmath61 line opacity remains optically thick for the whole range of density considered in our calculations .",
    "when the gas density reaches a few @xmath68 @xmath4 , the opacity of both the @xmath2 and @xmath1 lines becomes comparable . at high gas density ,",
    "greater than a few times @xmath69 @xmath4 , all the three lines are thermalized . in this case , the opacity of the lines are determined by the usual boltzmann distribution of level population . as we can see from fig.[hco ] , the @xmath1 line has a significantly higher opacity than the @xmath2 line . from the behaviour of the line opacity as a function of gas density , we suggest that the comparison of opacity for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 pair constitutes a sensitive constraint to the gas density .",
    "the excitation temperature and line opacity for hcn molecules behave in a similar way ( fig.[hcn ] ) .",
    "however , the hcn lines become thermalized at higher density , above @xmath70 @xmath4 , due to lower collision rates in comparison to that of hco@xmath0 .    for completeness",
    ", we also calculate the excitation temperature and opacity as a function of the column density of hco@xmath0 for a gas density of @xmath28(h@xmath71 @xmath4 and a kinetic temperature of 10 k ( see fig.[ncol ] ) .",
    "the opacity of the three transitions increases monotonically with the hco@xmath0 column density .",
    "especially , the hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) transition shows appreciable opacity ( @xmath72 ) only above @xmath5(hco@xmath0)/@xmath6 @xmath73 @xmath8  km@xmath9  s , where the ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) transitions become rapidly optically thick .",
    "the comparison of the opacity for the @xmath2 and @xmath74 transitions of hco@xmath0 thus gives useful informations on the column density of absorbing gas .",
    "so far , we have neglected the effect of the infrared radiation field emitted by dust particles , on the excitation of the hcn and hco@xmath0 molecules .",
    "both molecules can be excited from the ground state @xmath65 to the @xmath66 rotational level of the first bending mode @xmath75 by the absorption of ir photons at 14 @xmath20 m for hcn and 12 @xmath20 m for hco@xmath0 .",
    "subsequent decay transfers a fraction of the excited molecules to the @xmath76 level of the ground state .",
    "the strength of the local radiation field at the location where the absorption arises is still poorly known .",
    "van @xcite adopt a representative radiation field consisting of two components : a warm dust component at a temperature of 150 k and a cooler dust component at 43 k. obviously , only the warm dust component contributes to the ir radiation at the absorption wavelengths of hcn and hco@xmath0 molecules .",
    "we have repeated our lvg calculations for the hcn molecule taking directly into account the ir pumping .",
    "the formulae for the excitation and de - excitation rates are taken from @xcite .",
    "results are shown in figure [ hcn ] . because of ir pumping , the excitation temperatures of all rotational transitions increase noticeably in comparison to the case without ir pumping for gas densities below 10@xmath77 @xmath4 . at higher densities approaching 10@xmath78 @xmath4",
    ", the effect of ir pumping is very small , as expected .",
    "we note that at low gas densities , where more molecules are excited by ir pumping to higher @xmath64 levels , there is an increase in the opacity of the @xmath1 transition while the opacity of @xmath2 transition is reduced .",
    "interestingly , the opacity of @xmath61 transition remains approximately the same as in the case without ir pumping .",
    "because both hcn and hco@xmath0 molecules have similar transition probability ( @xcite ) and vibrational transition frequency , we expect very similar results for the excitation of hco@xmath0 molecules .",
    "it is clear from figure [ hcn ] that with or without the ir pumping the behavior of the line opacity as a function of the gas density does not change qualitatively .",
    "observationally , the @xmath1 absorption of hco@xmath0 and hcn is very weak , suggesting that the ir pumping probably does not play an important role in the excitation of these molecules .",
    "therefore our conclusion in the previous section is not affected by ir pumping .",
    "the lvc components , i.e. , between @xmath79 and 560 km  s@xmath9 , all exhibit strong absorption in the hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) transition with opacities @xmath80 , whereas our sma data shows that the hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) absorption of the same features is relatively weak , with opacities @xmath81 . from fig.[hco ] , we can thus estimate that , in order to be consistent with the observations , the density of the absorbing gas should be about @xmath3 @xmath4 for a hco@xmath0 column density per velocity unit on the order of @xmath7 @xmath8  km@xmath9  s.    similarly , the hcn ( 1 - 0 ) absorption components reach an opacity of about 0.9 , while our tentative detection of hcn ( 3 - 2 ) absorption suggests opacity well below 0.1 . this is also consistent with gas density of about @xmath3 @xmath4 and column density per velocity unit of @xmath82 @xmath8  km@xmath9  s ( fig.[hcn ] ) .",
    "our results are therefore comparable to that obtained by @xcite from analysis of the @xmath83co and @xmath27co ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) lines for the deepest absorption feature at @xmath84 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "they estimate a kinetic temperature of no more than 10 k and a gas density of around @xmath85 @xmath4 .",
    "they also note , however , that the hyperfine structure line ratios for the hcn and cn ( 1 - 0 ) transitions could suggest a clumpy medium , with density possibly up to @xmath69 @xmath4 .",
    "we do not see evidence of such high density medium from our data .",
    "the main goal of these observations was to probe the physical properties of the gas associated with the hvc absorption , possibly associated with the circumnuclear disk around the supermassive black hole in cen a. the hvc absorption is best detected in hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) , but also appears in hi ( although with no one to one correspondence , see e.g. @xcite ) , oh ground state lines ( van @xcite ) , hcn and hnc ( 1 - 0 ) , and cs ( 2 - 1 ) lines ( @xcite ) . according to the results of our excitation analysis , the non - detection of hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) absorption counterpart to hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) components suggests that the gas density is lower than a few times @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite proposed a kinematical explanation for the hvc absorption , which could be caused by clouds located at large galactocentric radii on the order of 0.5 kpc and high altitude of @xmath86 pc above the disk .",
    "whereas our observations give contraints on the physical conditions of the molecular gas , particularly on density , they alone can not rule out the existence of a circumnuclear disk neither confirm the kinematic interpretation of the complex absorption system .",
    "we have observed the absorption from the hco@xmath0 and hcn ( 3 - 2 ) transition toward the center of centaurus a with the submillimeter array .",
    "at least two absorption components are identified in the hco@xmath0 ( 3 - 2 ) spectrum .",
    "a first narrow component , located at @xmath87 km  s@xmath9 , reaches a depth of about 16% of the continuum level and corresponds to the deepest absorption component observed in other molecules and hi . a second weak component , approximately 10 km  s@xmath9 blueward and 7% deep , probably corresponds to the blend of several narrow components identified in the hco@xmath0 ( 1 - 0 ) spectrum by @xcite . given our sensitivity of 2.5% of the continuum level ,",

    "while the sensitivity and dynamic range of our sma observations are limited , the weak absorption in the hco@xmath0 and hcn ( 3 - 2 ) transitions , as compared to the corresponding @xmath2 absorption , provides useful informations about the physical conditions of the absorbing gas .",
    "we have performed a simple excitation analysis for the @xmath2 , @xmath67 and @xmath74 transitions of hco@xmath0 and hcn molecules .",
