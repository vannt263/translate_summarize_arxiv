    "first studied over forty years ago , the transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) have regained widespread attention because of parallels between many of their properties and phenomena observed in high temperature superconducting copper - oxide and iron - arsenide materials@xcite . in addition to having a layered , quasi-2d structure , these materials exhibit competition between superconductivity ( sc ) and charge density wave ( cdw ) order@xcite , interplay between electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions@xcite ,  strange metal \" normal state properties , pseudogap effects @xcite , etc .",
    "of particular interest is the response of such materials to impurity dopants or pressure , which are known to tune the structural and electronic properties of tmd materials @xcite .",
    "prominent examples include the stabilization of superconductivity by cu intercalation in 1@xmath0-tise@xmath3@xcite and 1@xmath0-tas@xmath3@xcite , as well as pressure induced superconductivity and its coexistence with cdw in ti doped 1@xmath0-tas@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "here we present a x - ray structural study of the effects of ti doping on the cdw in 1@xmath0-tas@xmath3 .",
    "tas@xmath3 exhibits the most intricate cdw phenomenology of all the dichalcogenides , having three distinct phases including an incommensurate ( ic ) phase that sets in below @xmath8=1120 k , a nearly commensurate ( nc ) phase below @xmath9=350 k , and finally a commensurate ( c ) phase below @xmath10=180 k @xcite .",
    "the lowest transition is first order and is usually attributed to a mott transition in which the remaining valence electrons ( that have not already been gapped by the nc phase ) crystallize into a static lattice with superlattice parameter @xmath11@xcite .",
    "this phase is characterized by a significant peierls distortion consisting of repeating units with the structure of a star of david ( fig .",
    "[ david ] ) , and might also be thought of as a polaron lattice .",
    "the nominal cdw wave vectors of these phases are summarized in table [ puretas2 ] .",
    ".nominal in - plane component of the cdw wave vector in undoped tas@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath12 represents the magnitude and @xmath13 the azimuthal angle in the basal plane ( see fig .",
    "[ 6cdwfig ] ) .",
    "* @xmath14 * , * @xmath15 * and * @xmath16 * are reciprocal lattice vectors associated with real space basis vectors @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the wave vector in the third direction stays very close to @xmath20 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the influence of ti doping was originally studied by disalvo @xcite , where it was shown that ti substitutes for ta , hole - doping the system .",
    "they also showed that tas@xmath3 is unstable with respect to the formation of s vacancies , which electron dope the system . hence , unless steps are taken to keep the s content stoichiometric , through the use of precisely controlled s overpressure@xcite , the composition should be written ta@xmath1ti@xmath2s@xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a small number .",
    "even trace quantities of either ti impurities or s vacancies eliminate the c phase altogether@xcite . this may be because the additional carriers screen the coulomb interactions responsible for mott localization@xcite .",
    "ti doping also reduces @xmath9 and broadens this transition .",
    "one intriguing observation by disalvo @xcite is that the resistance change at @xmath9 , characterized by the ratio @xmath23 , exhibits a peak at @xmath24 .",
    "the enthalpy change at the transition , @xmath25 , also exhibits a peak at a similar composition@xcite .",
    "these effects been attributed to cation ordering@xcite , which might exhibit a period of @xmath26 and would stabilize a cdw of the same wave vector .",
    "however , no evidence for structural ordering of cations , which would appear as a diffuse ring of scattering in x - ray experiments , has been observed in this system .    to understand the origin of the resistance peak , and the effects of ti doping on tas@xmath3 more generally , it is crucial to measure the composition dependence of the wave vector of the cdw .",
    "ti substitution should decrease the luttinger volume of the fermi surface and , presumably , the size of whatever nesting vectors may be relevant to cdw formation ( if any ) .",
    "wave vector studies would , then , provide insight into changes in fermi surface topology , and shed light on the origin of cdw formation in pure tas@xmath3 as well as doped materials .",
    "single crystals of ta@xmath1ti@xmath2s@xmath21 with @xmath5 , 0.04 , 0.08 , and 0.12 were grown using iodine vapor transport techniques described previously by the same growers.@xcite no special methods were used to fix the s stoichiometry , so we expect these crystals to contain trace amounts of s vacancies .    prior to x - ray studies ,",
    "the resistivity of the crystals was characterized with 4-terminal transport measurements .",
    "the crystals were prepared by attaching the as - grown flakes onto a glass slide and making contacts with conductive silver paint in a hall bar geometry .",
    "indium was used to contact leads to the pads .",
    "the samples were current - biased and the differential voltage was read - out using the standard lock - in technique .",
    "the samples were cooled to @xmath27 in a liquid helium flow cryostat and the temperature swept using resistive heater .",
    "confirming the results of previous studies,@xcite ti doping was found to reduce @xmath9 and to broaden this transition , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ resistivity ] .",
    "moreover , no c phase was observed , which suggests that our samples contain a small but unknown concentration of s vacancies .",
    "nevertheless , the intriguing peak in the resistance ratio , @xmath23 , is reproduced in our data at the same value @xmath24 reported previously@xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ peak8 ] .",
    "therefore , it is still possible with our materials to investigate this particular phenomenon .",
    "x - ray experiments were done with mok@xmath28 radiation ( 17.4 kev ) from an 18 kw rigaku ru-300 rotating anode source .",
    "samples were cooled with a closed - cycle cryostat mounted to a huber four - circle diffractometer .",
    "the angular resolution of the instrument was not sufficient to investigate lineshape changes in the cdw , but was adequate for measuring integrated intensities , which are the focus of the current study .",
    "the high temperature symmetric structure of 1@xmath0-tas@xmath3 consists of identical three - atom - thick tas@xmath3 sheets that are bound by van der waals forces .",
    "each layer has a trigonal antiprismatic structure , but overall octahedral symmetry over two layers , with lattice parameters @xmath17 = @xmath18 = 3.36  and @xmath19 = 5.90  .",
    "the signature of a cdw in x - ray experiments is the appearance of a superlattice reflection below the ordering transition whose momentum appears at fractional miller indices , i.e. , @xmath29 , where either @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 is not an integer , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are bravais vectors of the reciprocal lattice .",
    "following previous conventions @xcite , we will express @xmath36 in terms of the magnitude of the in - plane wave vector , @xmath12 , the angle of this vector in the basal plane , @xmath13 , and the third miller index , @xmath32 , which describes the stacking periodicity in the @xmath37 direction .",
    "these quantities are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ 6cdwfig ] .",
    "the nominal wave vectors of the various cdw phases in pure tas@xmath3 are given in table [ puretas2 ] .",
    "in the current study we will focus on the reflection that lies closest to the ( 3/13 , 1/13 , 8/3 ) commensurate point , which is one of the satellites of the @xmath38 structural bragg peak .",
    "the behavior of the cdw wave vector as a function of temperature for all four samples  both for heating and cooling cycles  is displayed in fig . [ hkl4 ] .",
    "apart from the absence of the @xmath39 phase , which does not occur in our materials , results for the tas@xmath21 system are very similar to the past observations of scruby.@xcite changes in the magnitude , @xmath12 , are small across the entire temperature range .",
    "the azimuthal angle , on the other hand , abruptly rotates from @xmath40 to @xmath41 when cooling through @xmath9 , and continuously changes as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the cdw  stacking \" along the @xmath42 direction stays close to the commensurate value , @xmath43 ( the slight changes visible are due to thermal expansion of the sample stage ) .    as ti",
    "is added , the azimuthal angle in the ic phase stays fixed at approximately @xmath40 . in the nc phase , however , @xmath13 changes significantly with ti concentration , from approximately @xmath44 at @xmath5 to appoximately @xmath45 at @xmath6 .",
    "further , at higher doping levels , the value of @xmath12 abruptly changes at @xmath9 .",
    "this stands in contrast to the undoped case , in which only the @xmath13 angle changes at the transition .",
    "the integrated intensity of the cdw reflection , which characterizes the amplitude of the cdw , was also found to be dependent on temperature and doping ( fig .",
    "[ cdwpeak ] ) . at @xmath5",
    "some hysteresis was observed in the cdw intensity , though not in the value of @xmath9 . like the resistance ratio showed in fig .",
    "[ peak8 ] , the cdw intensity also exhibits a local maximum at @xmath46 .",
    "this indicates that , while @xmath9 is suppressed in this system by ti disorder , the cdw amplitude is maximum for this composition .    at higher ti concentrations",
    ", anomalies were also observed in the fundamental , structural lattice at @xmath9 .",
    "[ 003peak ] shows the intensity of the ( 003 ) structural bragg peak as a function of @xmath0 for all four compositions . at @xmath5 and @xmath47 ,",
    "the temperature dependence is featureless , though at @xmath48 the curve is anomalous in that the intensity increases with increasing @xmath0 , which is the opposite of what is expected from a debye - waller effect . at higher doping ,",
    "however , a pronounced intensity anomaly is observed at @xmath9 . with its peak intensity ten times stronger than that in @xmath49 ,",
    "the anomaly is largest in the @xmath24 sample .",
    "this is also the doping at which we have observed the largest cdw amplitude and the largest resistance change at the transition .",
    "our results suggest a simple , physical explanation for the origin of the resistive jump at @xmath9 , which as shown in fig .",
    "[ resistivity ] exhibits a maximum at @xmath46.@xcite this effect was speculated by fazekas@xcite to be due to pinning on the ti dopants , which at @xmath24 might have a similar periodicity as the cdw .",
    "however , no evidence for ordering of the cations , which would appear as a temperature - independent ring of diffuse scattering , has been reported in the literature , nor have we observed it in the current study .    instead , we refer the reader to fig .",
    "[ distfromccdw2 ] , which shows the distance , @xmath22 , in momentum space between the observed cdw peak position and the nominal commensurate wave vector @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is a measure of the degree of incommensurability of the cdw , and is given in both the ic and nc phases for the four compositions .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ distfromccdw2 ] ( nc phase ) shows that @xmath24 corresponds to the composition at which @xmath22 is minimum , i.e. , at which the cdw is most commensurate .",
    "this is also the composition at which the cdw has the largest amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ cdwpeak ] ) , the largest resistance change at @xmath9 ( fig . [ peak8 ] ) , and the largest intensity anomaly in the @xmath38 reflection ( fig .",
    "[ 003peak ] ) .",
    "this anomaly suggests that significant symmetry - breaking fluctuations take place near the transition , at this composition , even in the underlying lattice .",
    "our data suggests that the nc phase is the most stable at @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore suggest an alternative explanation , which is that the peak shown in fig .",
    "[ resistivity ] is a commensuration effect .",
    "as originally pointed out by mcmillan,@xcite the free energy of a cdw has a significant contribution from pinning on the lattice , which makes it energetically favorable for a cdw to take on a periodicity that is a commensurate multiple of the undistorted structure .",
    "this commensuration energy will increase the energy gap , and lower the overall free energy , of a commensurate state compared to an incommensurate state , and gives rise to the lock - in transitions observed in many dichalcogenides.@xcite our study indicates that the enhanced amplitude and resistance anomaly associated with the cdw at @xmath24 arise because the fermi surface geometry at this composition favors a cdw phase with a wave vector that is close to a commensurate point . as the result , charge mobility decreases at this doping .",
    "note also ( fig .",
    "8) that the degree of commensurability , @xmath22 , in the ic phase decreases monotonically ti content , with no anomaly in @xmath51 .",
    "this suggests that commensurability plays a less important role in formation of the ic phase than it does in the nc phase .",
    "finally , ti doping was observed to influence the kinetics of the phase transition . in the pure sample ,",
    "the transition at @xmath9 is narrow in temperature .",
    "by contrast , as ti impurities are added the transition broadens into a crossover region characterized by coexistence of both nc and ic phases ( see shaded blue regions in figs .",
    "[ hkl4 ] and [ cdwpeak ] ) .",
    "we attribute this effect to heterogeneous nucleation driven by nonstoichiometric disorder arising from ti dopants .",
    "we have presented temperature - dependent transport and x - ray diffraction measurements of the influence of ti hole doping on the charge density wave ( cdw ) in 1@xmath0-ta@xmath1ti@xmath2s@xmath3 in the nearly commensurate ( nc ) phase .",
    "we observed significant changes in the cdw wave vector as a function of both temperature and ti doping .",
    "our x - ray scattering results showed a first order phase transition from the ic phase to the nc phase in all doping levels with decreased transition temperature as ti doping was increased .",
    "the doping level @xmath24 was found to be special in that it exhibits a peak in the amplitude of the cdw in the nc phase and the largest anomaly in the ( 0,0,3 ) structural bragg reflection , in addition to the large resistance change previously reported.@xcite we argue that these anomalies arise because the cdw is most commensurate with the lattice at x=0.08 .",
