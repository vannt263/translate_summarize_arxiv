    "alma executing blocks were first calibrated in the casa software ( version 4.2.0 ) and then exported to gildas . in order to recover the large - scale extended emission filtered out by the interferometer , we used fully sampled single - dish maps as `` zero- '' and `` short - spacings '' .",
    "maps were obtained with the iram-30 m telescope ( pico veleta , spain ) using the emir330 receiver under excellent winter conditions ( @xmath411  mm of precipitable water vapour ) . on - the - fly ( otf ) scans of a 170@xmath31@xmath20170@xmath31 region were obtained along and perpendicular to the orion bar .",
    "the beam full - width at half maximum power ( fwhm ) at 350ghz is @xmath167@xmath31 .",
    "the gildas / mapping software was used to create the short - spacing visibilities[31 ] not sampled by alma .",
    "these visibilities were merged with the interferometric observations .",
    "each mosaic field was imaged and a dirty mosaic was built .",
    "the dirty image was deconvolved using the standard hgbom clean algorithm and the resulting cubes were scaled from jy / beam to brightness temperature scale using the synthesized beam size of @xmath161@xmath31 .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath169 higher resolution than previous interferometric observations of the hco@xmath1 @xmath24=1 - 0 line towards the bar@xcite .",
    "the achieved rms noise is @xmath160.4  k per 0.4 km  s@xmath11 channel , with an absolute flux accuracy of @xmath1610% .",

    "to better understand the spatial distribution of the h@xmath0 @xmath49=1 - 0 @xmath50(1 ) line emission at @xmath54=2.12  @xmath38 m ( h@xmath23 ) presented in ref.@xcite and shown in extended data fig .  2 , we note two effects that determine the resulting emission morphology .",
    "first , there is a bright star in the line of sight towards the bar ( @xmath55aori at @xmath56(2000)=5@xmath935@xmath5722.9@xmath58 ; @xmath45(2000)=-05@xmath5324@xmath5257.8@xmath31 ) that saturates the near - ir detectors in a slit of @xmath164@xmath31-width parallel to the bar ( roughly between @xmath59 and 23@xmath31 in our rotated images ) .",
    "hence , no h@xmath23 data is shown in this range",
    ". therefore , the layers with h@xmath0 vibrational emission are wider that what extended data fig .",
    "2 might suggest , and more h@xmath23 emission peaks can coincide with hco@xmath1 peaks in the blanked @xmath60 region .",
    "older , lower - angular and -spectral resolution near - ir images do show[32 ] that the h@xmath23 emission extends out to @xmath61 .",
    "second , dust extinction ( due to foreground dust in orion s veil and also due to dust in the bar itself ) may affect the apparent morphology of the near - ir images .",
    "such effects are often neglected[1 , 32 , 33 ] and are not included in extended data fig .  2 .",
    "the extinction towards the bar produced by the veil is not greater than about 2 mag[34 ] . adopting a dust reddening appropriate to orion[11 , 35 ] , , and the extinction law in ref.[35 ]",
    ", we estimate that the h@xmath23 emission lines would only be a factor of @xmath1630%  brighter if foreground extinction corrections are taken into account .",
    "an additional magnitude of extinction due to dust in the atomic layer of the bar itself , results in a line intensity increase of @xmath1650% .",
    "therefore , minor morphological differences between the near - ir and millimetre - wave images can reflect a small - scale or patchy extinction differences in the region@xcite .      in order to estimate the physical conditions of the hco@xmath1 emitting gas near the dissociation front we run a grid of non - local , non - lte excitation and radiative transfer ( monte carlo ) models .",
    "this approach allows us to explore different column densities , gas temperatures and densities .",
    "compared to most pdr models ( using local escape probability approximations ) our models take radiative pumping , line trapping and opacity broadening into account .",
    "this allows for the treatment of optically thick lines ( see the appendix in ref.[36 ] for code details and benchmarking tests ) .",
    "our models use the most recent inelastic collisional rates of hco@xmath1 with h@xmath0 and with electrons , and of co with both h@xmath0 and h. the electron density , @xmath62 , can be an important factor in the collisional excitation of molecular cations in fuv - illuminated gas . for hco@xmath1 , collisions with electrons start to contribute above @xmath62@xmath6310  @xmath22 ( or @xmath29@xmath6310@xmath30  @xmath22 if most of the electrons are provided by carbon atom ionisation ) . in pdrs ,",
    "collisions of molecules with h atoms can also contribute because the molecular gas fraction , @xmath64=2@xmath65(h@xmath0)/@xmath29=2@xmath65(h@xmath0)/[@xmath65(h)+2@xmath65(h@xmath0 ) ] , is not 1 ( fully molecular gas ) .",

    "this includes several hco@xmath1 , h@xmath48co@xmath1 , hc@xmath72o@xmath1 and c@xmath72o rotational lines in the estimation ( the quoted dispersions in the column densities reflect the uncertainty obtained from least square fits to rotational population diagrams ) .",

    "in addition , the hco@xmath1/h@xmath48co@xmath1 column density ratios derived from single - dish observations are similar to the @xmath78c/@xmath78c=67 isotopic ratio in orion[39 ] .",

    "in addition , for low critical density ( @xmath99 ) transitions such as the low-@xmath24 co transitions , lines are close to thermalisation at densities above @xmath1610@xmath15  @xmath22 , thus @xmath98@xmath100@xmath13 ( with @xmath99=@xmath101/@xmath102 , where @xmath101 is the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission and @xmath102 is the collisional de - excitation rate coefficient ) .    in this case , @xmath103 is a good thermometer of the @xmath104@xmath971 emitting layers .",
    "the hco@xmath1 @xmath24=4 - 3 line , however , has much higher critical densities ( @xmath105@xmath635@xmath2010@xmath33@xmath22 and @xmath106@xmath8010@xmath42  @xmath107@xmath22 ) . for @xmath29@xmath412@xmath105/@xmath79 ( sub - thermal excitation ) ,",

    "pdr models@xcite and co observations respectively show that @xmath17(hco@xmath1 ) and @xmath13 do not change significantly in the pdr layers around the h@xmath23 emission peaks ( between @xmath75@xmath141 and 2  mag ) . in a nearly edge - on pdr ,",

    "the relatively modest @xmath122 value inferred in the @xmath27=7@xmath31 - 30@xmath31 layer is consistent with the low mach numbers in the pdr , and suggests a significant role of magnetic pressure .",
    "we note that a similar analysis of the co emission does not yield the same log - normal distribution .",
    "this is consistent with low-@xmath24 co lines being optically thick and tracing gas temperature and not gas density variations .",
    "this reinforces that the log - normal shape of the @xmath28 pdf in the compressed layer is a relevant observational result .      to support to the cloud compression and gas photo - ablation scenario , we investigated the different contributions to the gas pressure in the region . the thermal pressure in the hii  region near the ionisation front@xcite is @xmath124/@xmath90=2@xmath36@xmath62@xmath36@xmath125@xmath146@xmath2010@xmath126  k@xmath22 , about 6 times higher than the turbulent ram pressure @xmath127=@xmath128@xmath129 in the ambient molecular cloud ( extended data table  1 ) . since we find similar contribution of thermal and non - thermal ( turbulent ) pressures in both the ambient cloud and the over - dense substructures ( @xmath56=@xmath130/@xmath131@xmath14@xmath132/@xmath112@xmath141 ) , it is reasonable to assume equipartition of thermal , turbulent and magnetic energies to quantify the magnetic pressure in the pdr ( @xmath133=@xmath134/8@xmath135 ) .",

    "such strong magnetic fields at small scales need to be confirmed observationally ( both the strength and the orientation ) but seem consistent with the high values ( @xmath16100@xmath38 g ) measured in the low - density foreground material[45 ] ( the `` orion veil '' ) confirming that @xmath137 is particularly strong in the orion complex . on much larger spatial scales ,",
    "low - angular resolution observations do suggest that b increases with gas density at hii / cloud boundaries ( @xmath138)[46 ] .    a strong magnetic field",

    "owing to the high thermal pressure in the compressed structures , we also find that a pressure gradient , with @xmath112@xmath145@xmath124 exists .",
    "this subtle effect is seen in simulations of an advancing shock - wave around an hii  region[22 , 48 ] .",
    "alma reveals fainter hco@xmath1 and co emission in the atomic layer ( hco@xmath1 globulettes and plume - like co features at @xmath146 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "previous low - angular resolution observations and models had suggested the presence of dense spherical clumps with 5@xmath31 - 10@xmath31 sizes deeper inside the molecular cloud@xcite ( at @xmath14515@xmath31 - 20@xmath31 from the ionisation front[3 , 6 , 32 ] ) .",

    "in addition , despite the small size of the observed region , the crosscuts of the hco@xmath1 @xmath24=4 - 3 line velocity centroid and of the fwhm velocity dispersion , show gradients perpendicular to the bar ( extended data fig .  4 ) .",
    "moving from the ionisation front to the molecular gas , the line centroid shifts to higher velocities ( gas compression effects may , in part , contribute to this red - shifted velocity ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion , however , shows its maximum between the ionisation and the dissociation fronts , the expected layers for photoablative neutral gas flows .",
    "both the kinematic association with the bar velocities and the higher velocity dispersion between the two fronts is are consistent with the presence of gas flowing from the high - pressure compressed molecular layers ( @xmath112/@xmath90@xmath142@xmath2010@xmath37  k@xmath22 ) to the atomic layers ( @xmath149/@xmath90@xmath145@xmath2010@xmath126  k@xmath22 ) .",

    "this is likely another signature of dynamical effects .",

    "stationary pdr models of strongly irradiated dense gas ( with @xmath29 of a few 10@xmath33  @xmath22 ) have been presented in the literature@xcite .",
    "the above densities are similar to those inferred in the compressed substructures at the bar edge .",
    "thus they can be used to get insights about the chemistry that leads to the formation of hco@xmath1 and co in uv - irradiated dense gas .",

    "i.e. , the h / h@xmath0 and the c@xmath1/co transition layers naturally get closer ( in @xmath75)[50 ] .",
    "fast exothermic reactions of ch@xmath1 with h@xmath0 subsequently produce ch@xmath151 and ch@xmath152 .",
    "both hydrocarbon ions are `` burnt '' in reactions with abundant oxygen atoms and contribute to the hco@xmath1 formation at the molecular cloud edge .",
    "this hco@xmath1 formation route from ch@xmath1 can dominate over the formation of hco@xmath1 from co@xmath1 ( after the reaction , followed by , and finally [ 5 , 6 , 32 ] .",
    "both oh and co@xmath1 have been detected in the bar[56 , 57 ] , but high - angular resolution maps do not exist .",

    "extended data fig .",
    "2a shows a remarkable spatial agreement between the h@xmath0 @xmath49=1 - 0 @xmath50(1 ) emission peaks and several hco@xmath1 emission peaks .",
    "detailed h@xmath0 excitation models ( including both far - uv - pumping and collisions ) show that for the conditions prevailing in the bar , the intensity of the h@xmath0 @xmath49=1 - 0 @xmath50(1 ) line is approximately proportional to the gas density[42 ] .",
    "therefore , the hco@xmath1 peaks that match the position of the h@xmath0 @xmath49=1 - 0 @xmath50(1 ) line peaks likely correspond to gas density enhancements as well .",

    "the alma images thus confirm that in addition , or as a consequence of dynamical effects , reactions of h@xmath0 with abundant atoms and ions contribute to shift the molecular gas production towards the cloud edge .",
    "even higher - angular resolution observations of additional tracers will be needed to fully understand this , and to spatially resolve the chemical stratification expected in the overdense substructures themselves .",
    "we note that if most carbon becomes co at @xmath75@xmath142 ( @xmath73 of a several 10@xmath153  @xmath71 ) in substructures with gas densities of a few 10@xmath33  @xmath22 , this depth is equivalent to a spatial length of several 10@xmath154  cm , or an angular - scale of @xmath160.5@xmath31 at the distance to orion .",

    "<S> this resembles specific simulations in which the cloud compression is induced by the expansion of the ionised gas@xcite ( and not by a strong turbulence ) . searching for additional support to this scenario , we investigated the degree of turbulence and compared the different contributions to the gas pressure in the pdr ( extended data table  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the inferred non - thermal ( turbulent ) velocity dispersion , about 1  km  s@xmath11 , results in a moderate mach number of @xmath461 ( the ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the local speed of sound ) , i.e. only a gentle level of turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal pressure exerted by the hii  region at the h@xmath1/h interface@xcite is several times higher than the turbulent and thermal pressures in the ambient molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> these pressure differences , together with the detection of over - dense substructures close to the cloud edge , agree with the uv radiation - driven compression scenario@xcite . whether these substructures can be the seed of future star - forming clumps ( e.g. by merging into massive clumps ) is uncertain@xcite . at least presently , gravitational collapse is not apparent from their density distribution ( no high - density power - law tail@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , their estimated masses ( less than about 0.005  m@xmath47 are much lower than the mass needed to make them gravitationally unstable . </S>",
    "<S> even so , the increased uv - shielding produced by the ridge of high - density substructures likely contributes to protect the molecular cloud against photo - destruction for longer times .    </S>",
    "<S> the alma images also show co emission ripples@xcite along the molecular cloud surface ( undulations separated by less than about 5@xmath31@xmath140.01  pc in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b ) indicative of instabilities at the dissociation front . </S>",
    "<S> such small - scale corrugations resemble the `` thin - shell '' instability produced by the force imbalance between thermal ( isotropic ) and ram pressure ( parallel to the flow)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> characterising these interface instabilities in detail would require new magneto - hydrodynamic models including : i ) mesh - resolutions that are well below the scales achieved in current simulations@xcite , and ii ) include neutral gas thermochemistry .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , alma reveals fainter hco@xmath1 and co emission in the atomic layer ( hco@xmath1 globulettes and plume - like co features at @xmath45@xmath17@xmath4115@xmath31 , see fig .  2a , 2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dense gas hco@xmath1 emission structures must have survived the passage of the dissociation front@xcite , whereas the co plumes may trace either warm co that _ in situ _ reforms in the atomic layer , or molecular gas that advects or photoablates@xcite from the molecular cloud surface . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the pressure difference between the compressed molecular layers and the lower density atomic layer would favour such a flow . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , molecular line profiles from the plumes typically show two velocity components , one of them identical to that of gas from inside the bar ( extended data fig .  4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this kinematic association supports the presence of photoablative flows through the atomic layer , and overall agrees with the suggested role of dynamical and non  equilibrium effects in uv - irradiated clouds .    </S>",
