    "the numerical solution of helmholtz equation using the finite element method ( fem ) in the medium to high wave number remains a challenge due to the strong pollution effects that are present in this regime .",
    "it is known that when the standard galerkin method is used a so called scale resolution condition must be satisfied ( see @xcite ) in order to achieve a quasi optimality estimate that is robust in the wave number @xmath2 .",
    "invertibility of the linear system also holds only under certain conditions on the relation between @xmath2 and the discretization parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "this in particular imposes the use of high order finite elements and seems to exclude the possibility of using the simplest choice of piecewise affine elements . in this latter case",
    "the standard galerkin finite element method has to be modified in order to obtain an efficient method .",
    "such modifications often takes the form of least squares terms giving additional control of certain residual quantities , either in the element or on element faces . for low order finite elements",
    "there are a number of works on stabilized methods , typically using galerkin least squares approaches and some results on the effect of the stabilization on the dispersion error exist in the one dimensional case , see @xcite , or for an early example of the use of face based residuals see @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use discontinuous galerkin methods and in this framework it has been proven by feng and wu @xcite that provided a penalty on the jumps of derivatives over element faces is added to the formulation the linear system is always invertible .",
    "similar results were obtained using the continuous interior penalty method in a recent work by wu @xcite and numerical investigations showed that the pollution error could be greatly reduced by choosing the stabilization parameter appropriately . for wave - number - explicit error analyses of other methods including spectral methods and discontinuous petrov - galerkin methods , we refer to @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we continue the investigations initiated in @xcite , this time focusing on the one dimensional case and the effect of the penalty operator on the errors in amplitude and phase . throughout the paper , @xmath4",

    "first we will give alternative proofs of some of the results given in @xcite , showing for methods using a stabilization parameter with non - zero imaginary part the linear system is always well posed and the following error estimate holds @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the @xmath13-norm .",
    "then we consider the case when the stabilization parameter is real and by constructing the discrete green s function we derive an error estimate where the error is written as the sum of the best approximation error and a term proportional to the phase error .",
    "we prove a relation between the phase error and the stabilization parameter and show that for a particular range of values for the stabilization parameter , under a mild condition on the computational mesh , the pollution error is eliminated , leading to the optimal error estimate @xmath14 these results are finally verified computationally in several numerical examples .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we study the one - dimensional model problem and introduce the cip - fem . pre - asymptotic error estimates in @xmath1- and @xmath13-norms are derived in section  3 for any @xmath15 , @xmath16 and imaginary penalty parameters . in section  4 , we consider the dispersion analysis of the cip method and obtain the phase error estimates between the wave number @xmath2 of the continuous problem and some discrete wave number @xmath17 for different real penalty parameters .",
    "the discrete global system was solved explicitly in section  5 via the theory of fundamental system , it plays a major part in the stability and pre - asymptotic error analysis . in section  6 ,",
    "the stability and error estimates are proved directly and we can choose appropriate penalty parameter to eliminate the pollution effect in this section .",
