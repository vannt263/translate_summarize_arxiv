    "dual systems , in the form of nested spheres @xcite and nested cylinders @xcite have been recently proposed as wideband gravitational - waves detectors , of spectral sensitivity complementary in frequency to advanced interferometric detectors .",
    "dual spheres are based on two spherical masses nested together : the inner mass is a full sphere while the other one is a hollow sphere . the radii match so that only a small gap separates the two bodies .",
    "fundamental modes of both spheres are quadrupole modes sensitive to gravitational waves . by a proper choice of the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the two spheres ,",
    "the fundamental mode of the inner sphere occurs at a frequency 2 or 3 times larger than the fundamental mode of the hollow one , without any sensitive modes in the intermediate frequency domain between these two fundamental modes .",
    "this frequency domain is of particular interest as the spheres displacements caused by a gravitational wave are out of phase by @xmath0 radians , thus leading to a measurable variation of the gap between the spheres .    to get a wideband detector , very sensitive and",
    "non - resonant displacements sensors are needed .",
    "an efficient technique consists in using optomechanical sensors based on a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "one mirror of the cavity is coated on the inner side of the hollow sphere , whereas the other mirror is coated on the solid sphere .",
    "measurement of the phase of the field reflected by such a linear cavity thus provides information on the gap variation between the two spheres , at the radial position of the sensor .",
    "one can choose a strategy to set the number of optomechanical sensors and their location in such a way to reconstruct the sphere motion @xcite .",
    "a key point for broadband operation is the sensitivity of the optomechanical sensor which actually depends on its coupling with the mechanical modes of the system",
    ". since the frequencies of interest are between two mechanical resonances , dual systems are conceptually different from bars and interferometers . with bars",
    "one has to deal with a single resonator , driven by the gravitational wave at its fundamental frequency .",
    "the treatment of the bar excitation by the gravitational wave , by the thermal noise in the bar and in the transducer , and by the back - action noise induced by the sensor is relatively straightforward , including the understanding of the standard quantum limit .",
    "one gets a prediction of the narrow - band spectral sensitivity as a function of relevant parameters , dealing basically with few isolated modes @xcite . for the thermal noise",
    ", correlations may arise between the two modes originating from the tight coupling between the bar and the resonant transducer , when their mechanical quality factors are very different @xcite , but the noise spectral behavior does not suffer dramatic changes .    in the case of interferometers the gravitational wave drives a set of masses , which can be considered free above the pendulum resonant frequencies of the suspensions .",
    "again , the sources of noise can be spelled out , down to the quantum limit and the wideband spectral sensitivity can be predicted as a function of relevant parameters @xcite .",
    "dual systems are conceptually different in that one has to deal neither at resonance as with bars , nor far from resonant modes as with interferometers , but rather in between resonant modes .",
    "the difficulty is then to write a mechanical transfer function for the system valid in this unusual frequency range .    in this paper",
    "we determine the limits induced both by the thermal noise of the spheres and by the quantum fluctuations of light , including the measurement noise and the back - action effects of light on the dual system .",
    "we show in the case of a single sensor that the limit of sensitivity can be expressed in terms of mechanical transfer functions characterizing the optomechanical coupling of light with the two spheres .",
    "we illustrate this behavior in the case where only the excitation of fundamental modes of each sphere is taken into account , showing a new effect of back - action noise cancellation in the frequency domain between the two modes .",
    "this cancellation results from a destructive interference between radiation pressure effects on both spheres and leads to an increased sensitivity in between the two resonances .",
    "we then develop a simple approach to take into account all other mechanical modes of the spheres .",
    "this method allows to estimate the mechanical transfer functions in the intermediate frequency range between the resonances and gives an upper bound for the estimate error . as a result",
    "we determine the sensitivity of a dual - sphere detector and show that a spectral strain sensitivity better than @xmath1 hz@xmath2 can be obtained over a wide frequency range from @xmath3 khz to @xmath4 khz .",

    "the optomechanical sensor is based on a high - finesse single - ended cavity , resonant with the incident laser beam .",
    "the phase of the field reflected by the cavity is measured by a homodyne detection .",
    "as shown in @xcite the motion of one sphere ( full or hollow one ) induces a global phase - shift on the light proportional to the displacement @xmath7 of the mirror surface averaged over the beam profile , @xmath8 where the brackets stand for the overlap integral on the mirror surface , @xmath9 @xmath10 is the normal component of the displacement at point @xmath11 and time @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the transverse gaussian structure of the light intensity on the mirror , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the beam - spot size , identical for the two mirrors in the case of a symmetric cavity .",
