    "x - ray spectroscopy holds great promise for probing physics close to the accreting black holes thought to power active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) .",
    "the high x - ray luminosities observed from these systems are thought to be generated close to the black hole ( @xmath1 ; where @xmath2 is the gravitational radius ) where the effects of strong gravity , such as gravitational redshift and light bending , will imprint characteristic signatures on the emerging x - ray spectrum .",
    "as it escapes towards the observer , the primary x - ray emission will interact with material in the innermost regions , modifying the observed x - ray spectrum .",
    "reprocessing of the x - rays by an accretion disc will lead to a particular set of spectral features .",
    "absorption , fluorescence , recombination , and compton scattering in the surface layers of the x - ray illuminated disc produce a ` reflection ' spectrum . under a wide range of physical conditions",
    "the most prominent observables will be an emission line at @xmath3 ( the iron  fluorescence line ) and a broad ` hump ' in the spectrum which peaks in the range @xmath4 ( e.g. guilbert & rees 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ; george & fabian 1991 ; matt , perola & piro 1991 ) .",
    "observations of seyfert 1 galaxies with  ( pounds 1990 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) demonstrated the simultaneous presence of a @xmath3 emission line and an up - turn in the spectrum above @xmath5 , indicative of the reflection hump .",
    "the presence of the reflection hump has since been confirmed by  ( e.g. zdziarski 1995 ) and  ( e.g. perola 2002 ) .",
    "the bright seyfert 1 galaxy  ( @xmath6 ) has received particular attention since  observations revealed the presence of a broad , asymmetric emission feature at energies between @xmath7 identified with a highly broadened fe  emission line ( tanaka 1995 ) .",
    "similar features were subsequently observed in other seyfert 1 galaxies ( mushotzky 1995 ; nandra 1997 ) .",
    "the profile of the line can be explained in terms of fluorescent emission from the surface of an accretion disc extending down to @xmath8 about a supermassive black hole ( smbc ) : the relativistic ` disc line ' model ( fabian 1989 ; stella 1990 ; laor 1991 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the emission lines seen in other wavebands ( e.g. broad optical lines ) are thought to originate at distances @xmath9 .",
    "the broad fe line therefore potentially offers a powerful diagnostic of the physical conditions in the immediate environment of the black hole ( see fabian 2000 ; nandra 2001 and reynolds & nowak 2003 for recent reviews ) .",
    "repeated observations of  with  ( iwasawa 1996 , 1999 ; shih 2002 ) ,  ( guainazzi 1999 ) ,  ( lee 1999 , 2000 ; vaughan & edelson 2001 ) ,  ( lee 2002 ) and  ( wilms 2001 , hereafter w01 , and fabian 2002 , hereafter paper  i ) have confirmed the presence of the broad , asymmetric emission feature . however , while this is clearly not an artifact of any particular instrument or observation , there are uncertainties associated with the detailed modelling of the spectrum .",
    "the most challenging of these is that , along with many other seyfert 1s , shows complex absorption in its x - ray spectrum .",
    "this complicates the process of identifying the correct underlying continuum and thereby measuring the superposed line emission .",
    "indeed , the presence of relativistically broadened emission lines in the x - ray spectra of other seyfert 1 galaxies has recently become something of a _ cause celebre _ ( see e.g. lubinski & zdziarski 2001 ; inoue & matsumoto 2001 ; branduardi - raymont 2001 ; pounds & reeves 2002 ; page , davis & salvi 2003 ; pounds 2003a , b ) .",
    "the long ( @xmath10 )  observation of  is of great importance to studies of the broad iron line , since  offers the best established example of a relativistic line profile . in this paper",
    "the x - ray spectrum and spectral variability of  are examined using the long  observation .",
    "the interpretation of the spectrum in terms of relativistic fe  emission is investigated by fitting a range of models including both simple phenomenological models and models accounting for the detailed physics expected in photoionised accretion discs .",
    "these are compared to models that do not include relativistic effects in order to test the strength of the argument for strong gravity in .",
    "a variety of techniques are employed to characterise the spectral variability of the source and thereby further constrain the range of viable spectral models .",
    "the two  observations are considered in the context of the long term behaviour of  using  monitoring observations spanning more than six years .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : data ] gives details of the  and observations and their data reduction .",
    "section  [ sect : history ] briefly reviews the  monitoring of  and shows how the two  observations fit in with the long timescale properties of the source .",
    "section  [ sect : fit ] discusses the spectral fitting results using models that include relativistic effects ( section [ sect : fit_with ] ) and exclude relativistic effects ( section [ sect : fit_without ] ) . in section  [ sect : spec_var ] the spectral variability of the source is examined using flux - flux plots ( section  [ sect : ff ] ) , flux - resolved spectral analysis ( section  [ sect : fluxes ] ) , rms spectra ( section  [ sect : rms ] ) , time - resolved spectral analysis ( section  [ sect : time - res ] ) and principal component analysis ( pca ; section  [ sect : pca ] ) .",
    "section  [ sect : big_diff ] discusses differences between the long  observation of 2001 and the previous observation taken in 2000 .",

    "section  [ sect : disco ] presents a discussion of the main results and the main conclusions are given in section  [ sect : conc ] .",
    "some details of the epic spectral calibration are investigated in appendix  [ app : cal ] .",
    "( jansen 2001 ) has observed  twice .",
    "the first observation was performed during revolution 108 ( 2000 july 11 - 12 ) and the second observation was performed during revolutions 301303 ( 2001 july 31  august 5 ) . in both cases",
    "the source was observed on - axis and all instruments were operating nominally . the first results from the 2000  observation were presented in w01 and the first results from the 2001  observation were presented in paper  i.    during the 2000 observation the pn camera was operated in small window mode , the mos2 camera in full frame mode and the mos1 camera in timing mode . during the 2001 observation",
    "both the epic mos cameras and the epic pn camera were operated in small window mode .",
    "for the present analysis only the epic data taken in small window mode were used ( i.e. only the pn from the 2000 observation , pn and both mos from the 2001 observation ) .",
    "the pn small window mode uses a @xmath11 pixel window ( @xmath12 on the sky ) with the source positioned less than an arcminute from the ccd boundary .",
    "the mos small window mode uses a window of @xmath13 pixels ( @xmath14 ) with the source image approximately centred within the window .",
    "the small window modes allow ccd frames to be read out every @xmath15  ms for the pn and @xmath16 for the mos .",
    "these short frame times help lessen the effects of photon pile - up which can distort the spectrum of bright sources ( ballet 1999 ; lumb 2000 ) .",
    "all three epic instruments used the medium filter .",
    "the extraction of science products from the observation data files ( odfs ) followed standard procedures using the  science analysis system ( sas v5.4.1 ) .",
    "the epic data were processed using the standard sas processing chains to produce calibrated event lists .",
    "these removed events from the position of known defective pixels , corrected for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and applied a gain calibration to produce a photon energy for each event .",
    "source data were extracted from circular regions of radius @xmath17from the processed images and background events were extracted from regions in the small window least effected by source photons .",
    "these showed the background to be relatively low and stable throughout the observations , with the exception of the final few ks of each revolution where the background rate increased ( as the spacecraft approached the radiation belts at perigee ) .",
    "data from these periods were ignored .",
    "the total amount of ` good ' exposure time selected was @xmath18 from the pn during the 2000 observation , and for the 2001 observation @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the mos and pn , respectively .",
    "( the lower pn exposure is due to the lower ` live time ' of the pn camera in small - window mode , @xmath21 per cent ; strder 2001 )",
    ".    the ratios of event patterns as a function of energy showed there is negligible pile - up in the pn data but the mos data suffer slightly from pile - up .",
    "this may lead to a slight distortion of the mos spectra . in order to minimise this effect only photons corresponding to single pixel events ( epic patterns @xmath22 )",
    "were extracted from the mos cameras .",
    "the spectrum of single pixel events should be least affected by pile - up ( molendi & sembay 2003 ) . for the pn , single pixel",
    "( pattern @xmath22 ) and double pixel ( patterns @xmath23 ) events were extracted separately for the spectral analysis and fitted simultaneously ( the spectrum of single pixel events provides better energy resolution ) .",
    "response matrices were generated using rmfgen v1.48.5 and ancillary responses were generated with arfgen v.1.54.7 . for the 2001 observation source spectra",
    "were grouped such that each energy bin contains at least @xmath24 counts for the pn and @xmath25 counts for the mos as it results in fewer spectral bins ( and therefore reduces the computation time for each fit iteration ) but does not compromise the intrinsic spectral resolution .",
    "the data contain sufficient counts that even with this heavy binning the instrument resolution is oversampled . ] .",
    "for the shorter 2000 observation the pn spectrum was grouped to contain at least @xmath26 counts per energy bin .",
    "background subtracted light curves were extracted from the pn camera in @xmath27 bins using both single and double pixel events .      has been regularly monitored by  since 1996 . the proportional counter array ( pca )",
    "consists of five collimated proportional counter units ( pcus ) , sensitive to x - rays in a nominal @xmath28 bandpass and with a total collecting area of @xmath29 .",
    "however , due to operational constraints there are usually fewer than five pcus operated during any given observation .",
    "only data from pcu2 were analysed here as this is the one unit that has been operated consistently throughout the lifetime of the mission . in the following analysis",
    ", data from the top ( most sensitive ) layer of the pcu array were extracted using saextrct v4.2d .",
    "poor quality data were excluded using standard selection criteria  min ; earth elevation angle elv@xmath30 ; offset from optical position of  offset @xmath31 ; and electron2 @xmath32 .",
    "this last criterion removes data with high anti - coincidence rate in the propane layer of the pcu . ] .",
    "the pca background was estimated using the latest version of the ` combined ' model ( jahoda 2000 ) .",
    "light curves were initially extracted from the standard-2 data with 16 s time resolution .",
    "the data were rebinned into quasi - continuous observations lasting typically @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr_big ] shows the  light curve and hardness ratio around the times of the two  observations . from this it is clear that the source displays strong x - ray variability , but most is confined to short term ` flickering ' rather than longer term trends in the data .",
    "a counter example can be seen around mjd 52,000 when there appears to have been a prolonged period of lower flux and variability , during which the spectrum hardened slightly . however , both  observations seem to have caught  in its ` typical ' state ; there are no outstanding secular changes in either flux or hardness ratio to suggest anything other than normal behaviour in the source during the two  observations .",
    "the same conclusion is reached when the  monitoring extending back to 1996 are considered .",
    "papadakis ( 2002 ) and uttley , m@xmath34hardy & papadakis ( 2002 ) discuss the  monitoring observations in more detail .",
    "this section describes the results of the spectral fitting analysis .",
    "the raw spectra from the 2001 observation are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "a variety of models , both including and excluding relativistic effects , were fitted to the data .",
    "the goal of the analysis was to find the models that can accurately match the data , and test whether models including relativistic effects were preferred .",
    "this analysis expands upon the analyses of the same observation presented in paper  i , fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) and ballantyne ( 2003 ) in that the latest software and calibration were used ( as of 2003 may ) , a wider variety of spectral models was tested , and more information from other observations was used to better constrain the range of the model fits .",
    "the high signal - to - noise of these spectra mean that systematic errors in the detector response model can dominate over the statistical errors ( due to photon noise ) .",
    "a brief analysis of some calibration data is discussed in appendix  [ app : cal ] .",
    "this demonstrated that significant instrumental features should be expected close to the k - edges of o and si and the m - edge of au .",
    "elsewhere the spectrum shows no sharp instrumental residuals larger than @xmath35 per cent .",
    "therefore in the spectral fitting outlined below , the fitting is primarily carried out over the @xmath36 spectral range that excludes these features .",
    "appendix  [ app : cal ] also demonstrates that there is a strong discrepancy between the spectral slopes derived from each of the epic cameras ( see molendi & sembay 2003 ) .",
    "therefore the spectral slope of the power - law continuum was always allowed to vary independently between the three epic cameras .    with these precautions in place various spectral models",
    "were compared to the data as described below .",
    "the models were fitted to the four spectra ( pn : singles , pn : doubles , mos1 and mos2 ) simultaneously using xspec v11.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the quoted errors on the derived model parameters correspond to a @xmath37 per cent confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. a @xmath38 criterion ) , unless otherwise stated , and fit parameters are quoted for the rest frame of the source .",
    "the count spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] give only a poor indication of the true spectrum of the source since they are strongly distorted by the response of the detector . in order to gain some insight into the broad - band shape of the source spectrum , without recourse to model fitting ,",
    "the epic data for  were compared to the spectrum of c  ( see appendix  [ app : cal ] ) .",
    "the raw epic pn : s data ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) were divided by the raw pn : s spectrum for c. this gave the ratio of the spectra for the two sources .",
    "c  was chosen as it is a bright source and has a relatively simple spectrum in the epic band , i.e. a hard power - law plus smooth soft excess modified by galactic absorption ( page 2003b ) , and in particular does not contain any strong , sharp spectral features such as lines or edges",
    ". thus the ratio of  to c  spectra will factor out the broad instrumental response to give a better impression of the true shape of the  spectrum .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxed ] shows this ratio .",
    "the advantage of this plot is that it gives an impression of the  spectrum and is completely independent of spectral fitting .",
    "the disadvantages are that it is is in arbitrary units and only gives a very crude representation of the true flux spectrum of  because instead of being distorted by the instrumental response , it is now distorted by the spectrum of c.    a more accurate , but model - dependent method for obtaining a ` fluxed ' spectrum of  is to normalise the ratio by a spectral model for c. this technique is very similar to the method routinely used in optical spectroscopy of normalising the target spectrum using a standard star spectrum to obtain a wavelength - dependent flux calibration .",
    "the /c  ratio was multiplied by a spectral model for c(defined in flux units ) .",
    "the spectral model comprised a hard power - law plus two blackbodies to model the soft excess , modified by galactic absorption ( see appendix  [ app : cal ] and also page 2003b ) .",
    "this process transformed the raw  count spectrum into a ` fluxed ' spectrum , without directly fitting the  data .",
    "( the accuracy of this procedure does however depend on the accuracy of the cspectral modelling . ) the fluxed spectrum for  is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxed ] .    note",
    "that this procedure is not a formal deconvolution of the spectrum ( see blissett & cruise 1979 ; kahn & blissett 1980 ) and so does not correctly take into account the finite detector spectral resolution .",
    "nevertheless , it does provide a simple yet revealing impression of the source spectrum .",
    "specifically , the plot clearly reveals the strongest spectral features in , namely the strong warm absorption concentrated in the @xmath39 region and the iron line peaking at @xmath3 .        in the spectral fitting analysis described below the absorption due to neutral gas along the line - of - sight through the galaxy",
    "is accounted for assuming a column density of @xmath40 ( derived from @xmath41 measurements ; elvis , wilkes & lockman 1989 ) . accurately modelling",
    "the intrinsic absorption provided a more challenging problem .",
    "is known to possess a complex soft x - ray spectrum , affected by absorption in partially ionised ( ` warm ' ) material ( nandra & pounds 1992 ; reynolds 1995 ; otani 1996 ) and possibly also dust ( reynolds 1997 ; lee 2001 ; turner 2003a ; ballantyne , weingartner & murray 2003 ) .",
    "however , the detailed structure of the soft x - ray spectrum , as seen at improved spectral resolution with the grating instruments on board  and , remains controversial ( branduardi - raymont 2001 ; lee 2001 ; sako 2003 ; turner 2003a ) . in the present analysis the complicating effects of the warm absorber were mitigated by concentrating on the spectrum above @xmath42 .",
    "however , this will not entirely eliminate the effects of absorption .    in the @xmath0 range absorption by @xmath43 ions",
    "will be limited since their photoionisation threshold energies are less than @xmath42 for all charge states ( the ionisation energy for h - like si@xmath44 is @xmath45 ; verner & yakovlev 1995 ) .",
    "similarly , the l - shell of ionised fe can significantly absorb the spectrum around @xmath46 due to complexes of absorption lines and edges ( e.g. nicastro , fiore & matt 1999 ; behar , sako & kahn 2001 ) .",
    "these transitions all occur below @xmath47 ( the ionisation energy of the l - edge in li - like fe@xmath48 ) .",
    "thus above @xmath42 the only opacity from low-@xmath49 ions and fe  l will be due to the roll - over of their superposed photoelectric absorption edges .",
    "the dominant effect of the warm absorber on the spectrum above @xmath42 ( @xmath50 ) is thus to impose some subtle downwards curvature on the continuum towards lower energies .",
    "the only significant absorption features occurring directly in the @xmath36 energy range will be due to k - shell transitions in the abundant @xmath51 elements ( s , ar , ca , fe and ni ) .",
    "absorption in the @xmath52 range could be due to s , ar and ca while fe and ni may absorb above @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "comparison with the high quality   hetgs spectrum of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  3783 , which shows a very strong warm absorber ( kaspi 2002 ) , suggests that absorption due to s , ar and ca is likely to be weak ( see the top panel of their figure 1 and also blustin 2002 , behar 2003 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by an analysis of the  hetgs spectrum of  ( j. lee , piv .",
    "; see also section  [ sect : nh_test ] ) .",
    "turner ( 2003a ) fitted the rgs spectrum from the 2001 observation using a multi - zone warm absorber model plus absorption by neutral iron ( presumably in the form of dust ) .",
    "although the transmission function of this absorption model recovers above a few @xmath55 it nevertheless predicts the absorption remains significant at higher energies ( a @xmath56 per cent effect at @xmath42 ) due to the combined low - energy edges discussed above .",
    "therefore , to account for the absorption in  this multi - zone absorption model was included in the spectral fitting , with the column densities and ionisation parameters kept fixed at the values derived from fits to the rgs data ( these are in any case very poorly constrained by the epic data above @xmath42 ) .",
    "the values used are tabulated in table  1 of turner ( 2003a ; model 2 ) .",
    "the photoelectric edges were included but not the absorption lines .",
    "this absorption model therefore accounts for the subtle spectral curvature imposed by the warm absorber .",
    "resonance absorption lines from s , ar , ca and ni are unlikely to contribute significant equivalent width .",
    "the possibility of resonance line absorption by fe is explored separately below .",
    "the other noteworthy effects of the warm absorbing material above @xmath42 are due to the k - shell of iron .",
    "iron in f - like to h - like ions ( @xmath57 ) can absorb through  resonance lines in the @xmath58 range ( matt 1994 ; matt , fabian & reynolds 1997 ) which would be poorly resolved ( if at all ) in the epic spectra .",
    "sako ( 2003 ) estimated the resonance lines could produce a total absorption equivalent width of @xmath59 in  based on an analysis of the fe l - shell transitions present in the rgs spectrum from the 2000  observation .",
    "this absorption could alter the shape of the observed emission around the fe  emission line and was therefore accounted for in the analysis ( paper  i briefly explored the possible effect of iron resonance absorption ) .",
    "the other major source of opacity is k - shell photoelectric absorption of photons above @xmath60 ( palmeri 2002 ) .",
    "this could affect the continuum estimation on the high energy side of the line , and therefore the apparent line profile , if not properly accounted for ( see discussion in e.g. pounds & reeves 2002 ) .",
    "the edge due to neutral iron is negligible in ; the galactic and intrinsic ( dust ) neutral absorption gave @xmath61 .",
    "the warm absorbing material contains fe in wide a range of charge states , leading to a blurring together of the many k - edges over the @xmath62 range ( see palmeri 2002 ) . in the turner ( 2003a )",
    "absorption model the total optical depth due to these edges ( estimated by comparing the model transmission below the  edge to that at the minimum of the resulting absorption trough ) is only @xmath63 . using the ionic columns for fe derived by sako ( 2003 ) gave similar results ( @xmath64 around the k - edges ) .",
    "this suggests that while the line - of - sight material does produce iron k - edge absorption , it is rather shallow and spread over the @xmath65 range .",
    "the resulting distortion on the transmitted spectrum is far smaller than the statistical errors on the data above @xmath66 and thus is of little consequence to the spectral fitting . for completeness",
    "the absorption due to dust and warm gas in  ( as derived by turner 2003a ) was included in the absorption model used below .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath67 epic data were searched for additional fe absorption ( see section  [ sect : fe_test ] ) , such as fe  xxv - xxvi edges which would be undetectable in the lower energy grating spectra ( due to the lack of l - shell electrons ) .",
    "observations of  extending beyond @xmath68 with  ( pounds 1990 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) ,  ( lee 1998 , 1999 ) and ( guainazzi 1999 ; paper  i ) revealed an upturn in the spectrum and indicated the presence of a reflection continuum . particularly relevant to the present analysis is that  observed simultaneously with the 2001  observation .",
    "the data from the pds instrument provided spectral information extending up to @xmath69 .",
    "paper  i and ballantyne ( 2003 ) presented the results of fitting the  data with reflection models ( see in particular section 3 of ballantyne 2003 ) .",
    "these results strongly indicated that the reflection continuum is strong ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sect : intro ] , various missions have resolved the broad emission feature spanning the @xmath71 range . in each observation the spectrum can be fitted in terms of a disc line .",
    "there could in principle also be a contribution to the reflection spectrum from more distant material ( @xmath72 ) which would produce a much narrower , symmetric line .",
    "such lines have been resolved in the spectra of many other seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. yaqoob 2001 ; yaqoob , george & turner 2002 ; pounds 2003a ; reeves 2003 ) .",
    "the presence of such a narrow ` core ' could significantly affect model fits to the iron line profile if not correctly accounted for ( e.g. weaver & reynolds 1998 ) .    in the case of  the variations in the line profile observed by  during a low - flux period ( the ` deep minimum ' ) suggested the contribution to the line from distant material was small ( iwasawa 1996 ) .",
    "the higher resolution  hetgs spectrum ( lee 2002 ) was able to resolve the peak of the line emission near @xmath73 and confirm that the contribution due to distant material ( i.e. an unresolved line ` core ' ) is weak ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the 2000 observation of  also showed evidence for narrow line emission ( w01 ; reynolds 2003 ) .",
    "therefore the possibility of an unresolved iron emission line is allowed in the spectral models considered below .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum_rat ] shows residuals when the epic spectra are fitted with a simple model comprising a power - law plus neutral and warm absorption ( as discussed in section  [ sect : wa_intro ] ) .",
    "the only free parameters were the power - law slope ( photon index @xmath75 ) and normalisation .",
    "the spectral interval immediately around the fe k features ( @xmath76 ) was ignored during the fitting , and the model was subsequently interpolated over these energies .",
    "the residuals clearly reveal the strong iron  emission line peaking near @xmath73 .",
    "the emission line appears asymmetric in this ratio plot , extending down to at least @xmath77 ( this red wing on the line is far broader and stronger than that expected from the compton shoulder from cold gas ; matt 2002 ) .    as a first step towards modelling the iron features the @xmath76 region",
    "was examined in detail .",
    "a model was built in terms of a power - law continuum ( absorbed as described in section  [ sect : wa_intro ] ) plus three gaussian lines .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are shown in table  [ table : core ] .",
    "the lines were added to model the resolved line emission ( line 1 ) , the unresolved absorption at @xmath78 ( line 2 ) and the unresolved @xmath73 emission line ( line 3 ) . modelling the line with",
    "the single resolved gaussian emission line provided a reasonable fit , but the inclusion of the unresolved absorption and emission lines significantly improved the quality of the fit .",
    "the inclusion of the absorption line was an attempt to account for possible fe resonance absorption lines ( section  [ sect : fe_abs ] ) .",
    "source and background spectra were extracted exactly as for the observation .",
    "only single pixel event were used from the mos to reduce the effect of pile - up in this bright source ( see molendi & sembay 2003 ) .",
    "the grouped spectra were then fitted in the @xmath81 range with a simple power - law modified by galactic absorption ( @xmath82 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the power - law indices and normalisations were left independent for each camera . in all five observations",
    "the spectra from each camera showed weak but positive residuals at @xmath83 , suggesting the presence of iron line emission .",
    "previous studies of c  ( e.g. turner 1990 ; grandi 1997 ; reeves 2003 ) also suggested the presence of weak iron emission .",
    "a gaussian was therefore included in the model at @xmath73 ( in the source frame ) to account for iron emission ( with equivalent width @xmath84 ) .",
    "this simple model provided an acceptable fit to all five sets of spectra ( i.e. @xmath85 ) and showed that the four sets of spectra taken during rev .",
    "@xmath86 were very similar ( i.e. the source showed no spectral variability during this period ) .",
    "therefore the data from the four observations spanning these revolutions were combined to produce a high signal - to - noise spectrum for each epic camera .",
