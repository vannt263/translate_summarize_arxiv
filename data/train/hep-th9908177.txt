    "we are interested in subgroups of the group @xmath268 preserving the set @xmath280 . to describe them ,",
    "we fix @xmath281 and consider an orbit of the point @xmath282 under the action @xmath279 of the group @xmath268 .",
    "we want to find an intersection of this orbit with the set @xmath235 , i.e. the set of all @xmath283 such that    * @xmath284 , i.e. the transformation @xmath285 preserves eqs.(4.6a ) , * @xmath286 , i.e. the transformation @xmath287 preserves not only eqs.(4.6a ) , but also eqs.(4.6b )",
    ".    the condition ( i ) means that the transformation @xmath288 maps @xmath269 onto itself , which is realized , of course , not for any @xmath283 .",
    "this condition imposes severe constraints on @xmath77 which are equivalent to the following nonlinear functional equations : @xmath289 notice that eqs.(5.2a ) are satisfied trivially if @xmath290 , since in this case @xmath291 , @xmath292 .    by introducing @xmath293 and using formulae ( 2.5 )",
    ", we can rewrite eqs.(5.2a ) in the form @xmath294 formulae ( 5.2 ) mean that @xmath295 is a 1-cocycle , @xmath296 .",
    "the condition ( ii ) means that for the 1-cocycle @xmath297 one can find a splitting like ( 4.6b ) , i.e. there exists a 0-cochain @xmath298 such that @xmath299 this imposes additional restrictions on @xmath283 , and one of their possible resolvings is the following .",
    "recall that for the sheaf @xmath300 of smooth sections of the bundle @xmath301 we have @xmath302  @xcite .",
    "therefore for _ small _ deformations @xmath303 of the cocycle @xmath152 there always exists @xmath304 such that ( 5.3 ) is satisfied . as such , we shall consider elements @xmath283 that are close to the identity and satisfying eqs.(5.2 ) .",
    "in other words , we consider a _ local group _ ( a neighbourhood of the identity in @xmath268 ) and take only those its elements @xmath77 which satisfy the conditions ( 5.2 ) .",
    "if , in addition , we change the `` initial '' point @xmath305 for the action @xmath279 , then in the described way we shall obtain all elements of the group of bijections of the set @xmath235 .      in sect.4",
    "we have described maps @xmath306 and @xmath307 , where @xmath308 , @xmath309 , @xmath310 . in sect.5.1",
    "we have described the map @xmath311 where @xmath312 if elements @xmath313 satisfy some conditions .",
    "then , having found @xmath314 by formula ( 5.3 ) , we introduce @xmath315 from the equations @xmath316 and eqs.(5.3 ) it follows that @xmath317 s satisfy eqs.(4.2 ) , and @xmath318 s satisfy eqs.(4.1b ) , i.e. @xmath319 @xmath320 on @xmath177 .",
    "thus , if we take a flat connection @xmath187 and carry out the sequence of transformations @xmath321 we obtain a new flat connection @xmath322 .",
    "notice that by virtue of commutativity of the diagram ( 4.8 ) , one can consider the map @xmath323 instead of @xmath324 and the map @xmath265 instead of @xmath266 .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that @xmath325 where @xmath326 formally , ( 5.7 ) looks like a gauge transformation .",
    "but actually the transformation @xmath327 , defined by ( 5.7 ) , consists of the sequence ( 5.6 ) of transformations and is not a gauge transformation , since @xmath328 on @xmath329 .",
    "recall that for gauge transformations @xmath330 one has @xmath331 , i.e. @xmath332 is a _",
    "global _ section of the bundle @xmath19 , and @xmath333 is a collection of _ local _ sections @xmath334 of the bundle @xmath19 which are constructed by the algorithm described above .    from formulae ( 3.13 ) , ( 4.3 ) and ( 5.7b )",
    "it follows that the dressing transformation @xmath335 acts on any solution @xmath15 of eqs.(1.1b ) by the formula @xmath336 where @xmath337 is defined in ( 5.7b ) .",
    "the field @xmath338 is a new solution of eqs.(1.1b ) .",
    "as is shown above , the transformation @xmath339 is not a gauge transformation .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath333 depends on @xmath283 defining the transformation @xmath340 , and taking this into account we shall write @xmath341 .",
    "the transformations ( 5.7 ) will be called the _ dressing transformations_. in this terminology we follow the papers  @xcite , where the analogous transformations were used for constructing solutions of integrable equations .",
    "it is not difficult to show that these transformations form a group .",
    "notice that the maps ( 5.6 ) are connected with maps between the bundles @xmath342 , @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",
    "all these bundles are diffeomorphic but not isomorphic as locally constant bundles .",
    "a diffeomorphism of @xmath4 onto @xmath147 is defined by a 0-cochain @xmath345 , and a diffeomorphism of @xmath4 onto @xmath346 is defined by @xmath347 .",
    "moreover , the bundles @xmath147 and @xmath346 become isomorphic as locally constant bundles after the restriction to @xmath177 : @xmath348 , but these isomorphisms are different for @xmath349 with different @xmath188 .",
    "in other words , @xmath350 define _ local _ isomorphisms that do not extend up to the isomorphism of @xmath147 and @xmath346 as locally constant bundles over the whole @xmath0 .",
    "matrices @xmath351 , defining the dressing transformations @xmath352 must satisfy the nonlinear functional equations ( 5.2 ) which are not so easy to solve . however , there exists an important class of solutions to these equations , which can be described explicitly .",
    "the merit of these solutions is the fact that they do not depend on the choice of cocycles @xmath148 and @xmath152 .",
    "notice that eqs.(5.2 ) with all indices written down have the form @xmath353 where @xmath354 means the restriction of @xmath355 defined on @xmath185 to an open set @xmath356 and analogously for all other matrices .",
    "it is not difficult to verify that a collection @xmath357 of matrices such that @xmath358 satisfies eqs.(5.9 ) for any choice of 1-cocycles @xmath27 and @xmath220 .",
    "the constraints ( 5.10 ) are not very severe .",
    "they simply mean that sections @xmath355 of the sheaf @xmath34 over @xmath177 can be extended to sections of the sheaf @xmath34 over the open set @xmath359 where the summation is carried out in all @xmath188 for which @xmath177 .",
    "in other words , from ( 5.10 ) it follows that there exists a locally constant section @xmath360 of the bundle @xmath19 such that @xmath361 @xcite . in this case",
    "we can identify @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",
    "such @xmath77 form a subgroup @xmath364 of the group @xmath268 .",
    "now let us consider @xmath365 as a _",
    "local _ group , i.e. let us take @xmath77 from the neighbourhood of the identity in @xmath365",
    ". for such @xmath77 there always exists @xmath366 such that ( 5.3 ) is satisfied and one can introduce @xmath367 by formula ( 5.7b ) .",
    "notice that this map @xmath368 is a homomorphism .",
