    "the simplest model of an edge electron gas is the airy gas , where any electron feels a linear effective potential @xcite , and thus the normalized one - particle eigenfunctions are proportional to the airy function .",
    "the effective finite - linear - potential model gives remarkably good results for the jellium surface problem @xcite .",
    "however , the ke density derived in this approximation @xcite does not recover the correct second - order gradient expansion ke density @xcite and has an unphysical oscillating behavior in the limit of slow density variations @xcite , being a poor approximation for atoms @xcite .",

    "( this approximation is denoted in this paper by vjks gga . )",
    "they showed that the poor behavior of the kinetic energy density derived in the linearized - potential approximation @xcite is mainly due to a laplacian term that arises naturally in the airy gas model .",
    "thus , the laplacian term , even if it integrates to zero and does not affect the integrated ke , is an important tool in developing density functionals not only for the ke but also for the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy @xcite . the vjks gga ke density functional fits the airy gas ke density and is a good model for the ke density of the jellium surfaces , but for atoms and molecules it diverges to @xmath6 at the nuclei , due to the behavior of the laplacian term .",
    "the integrated kinetic energies are at a thomas - fermi @xcite level of accuracy , reducing considerably the error of the linearized - potential approximation @xcite .",

    "recent refined dmc estimates @xcite , and calculations in the random phase approximation @xcite and beyond it @xcite , agree with the popular xc semilocal density functionals , showing that the jellium surface can not only be accurately described in the context of density functional theory , but can also be an important model used to develop new density functionals .",

    "overall , this figure agrees well with the atomization ke of molecules reported in table [ ta2 ] , showing an important link between jellium spheres and molecules .",
    "these results and the liquid drop model ( see eq .",
    "( 17 ) of ref.@xcite ) suggest that the tf functional gives a good balance between jellium surface ke and jellium curvature ke .",

    "in this paper we have studied several semilocal ke density functionals derived from the airy gas .",
    "these functionals , that depend trivially on the laplacian of the density , do not satisfy several important constraints .",
    "their kinetic energy densities are not always positive , and they implicitly violate the important constraint @xmath61 ( here @xmath62 is the von weizscker ke density ) and diverge to @xmath6 at the nucleus of an atom",
    ". however , such functionals can be accurate for the integrated ke of jellium surfaces and jellium clusters ( e.g. @xmath63 ) , and of atoms and molecules ( e.g. @xmath64 ) , when we use realistic densities ( from ks calculations ) .",
    "more importantly , they are the most accurate ke density functionals , to our knowledge , for the integrated atomization kinetic energies of molecules and for the fragmentation of jellium clusters . these functionals may also be useful for quasi - realistic densities ( e.g. a superposition of free - atom kohn - sham densities ) , but they are not accurate enough for orbital - free calculations .    we have also presented a spin - unrestricted hartree - fock calculation for the stretched @xmath65 molecule that explains the @xmath65 atomization kinetic energies displayed in table [ ta2 ] , and that shows equilibrium lengths for many semilocal functionals .",
