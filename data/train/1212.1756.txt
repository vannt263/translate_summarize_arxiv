    "in a recent article entitled `` quantum contextuality from a simple principle ? '' @xcite , henson pointed out that in my paper `` a simple explanation of the quantum violation of a fundamental inequality '' @xcite , in which i presented an explanation of the maximum quantum violation of the klyachko - can - biniciolu - shumovsky ( kcbs ) inequality @xcite ( result  1 in @xcite ) , and also pointed out that the proof of impossibility of popescu - rohrlich ( pr ) nonlocal boxes @xcite by fritz _",
    "et al . _  in @xcite can be connected to the fact that the graph representing the exclusivity structure of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite contains , induced , exactly the same exclusivity structure of the kcbs inequality ( observation 1 in @xcite ) , and also introduced a family of quantum correlations exactly singled out by the principle ( initially called `` global exclusive disjunction '' ) that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events can not be higher than 1 ( result  2 in @xcite ) , i was implicitly assuming that `` if all pairs in a set of events are pairwise exclusive , [ then ] the set can itself be considered exclusive '' .",
    "indeed , i was making that assumption .",
    "henson called this assumption `` consistent exclusivity '' .    later , henson , in versions 2 and 3 of @xcite , added a note pointing out that `` consistent exclusivity '' is , `` when the exclusive sets are defined with relevance to non - locality '' , equivalent to the `` local orthogonality '' defined by fritz _",
    "et al . _  in @xcite .",
    "henson also pointed out that the word ` local ' is inappropriate when applied to the kcbs scenario or general scenarios where different `` parties '' are not distinguished .",
    "consequently , henson proposed to call the principle `` compatible orthogonality '' .",
    "the purpose of this note is to draw attention to the fact that this principle ( in any of its formulations ) is not new : ernst specker noticed it long ago and pointed out its fundamental importance .",
    "moreover , this principle was already used to bound and single out quantum correlations .",
    "the story can be summarized as follows :    * the origin can be traced back to specker s 1960 paper `` the logic of propositions which are not simultaneously decidable '' @xcite ( cited as ref . [ 9 ] in @xcite ) , where specker shows how this assumption exactly singles out classical ( and quantum ; see below ) correlations for a specific three - box game ( later called specker s parable of the overprotective seer @xcite ) , while theories not satisfying this assumption can achieve higher values .",
    "* it appears in the kochen - specker paper @xcite .",
    "simon kochen has recently commented the following : `` ernst and i spent many hours discussing the principle (  ) .",
    "the difficulty lays in trying to justify it on general physical grounds , without already assuming the hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics .",
    "we decided to incorporate the principle as an axiom in our definition of partial boolean algebras .",
    "it appears on pp .",
    "6566 as follows : a partial boolean algebra @xmath0 is a union of a family @xmath1 of boolean algebras which is ( i ) closed under pairwise intersection of boolean algebras , and such that ( ii ) if any two of a finite set @xmath2 of elements of @xmath0 lie in a common boolean algebra in @xmath1 then all the elements of @xmath2 lie in a common boolean algebra in @xmath1 .",
    "(  ) i have never found a general physical justification for ( ii ) '' @xcite .",
    "* its importance as a fundamental principle was stressed by specker in several occasions .",
    "for example , i heard it from specker himself in june 17 , 2009 in the following terms : `` do you know what , according to me , is the fundamental theorem of quantum mechanics ? (  ) that is , if you have several questions and you can answer any two of them , then you can also answer all three of them .",
    "this seems to me very fundamental '' .",
    "it is recorded in video @xcite .",
    "two different fragments of that evening s recordings ( one of them @xcite ) have been projected in several conferences since 2009 .",
    "longer fragments ( including @xcite ) have been circulating among colleagues .",
    "the fragment @xcite goes immediately after a comment that specker makes on the three - box game of his 1960 paper , and before further details on what the principle means within the formalism of quantum mechanics . *",
    "the importance of specker s three - box game was also noticed in liang , spekkens , and wisemans s paper significatively entitled `` specker s parable of the overprotective seer : a road to contextuality , nonlocality and complementarity '' @xcite , which was `` inspired by ernst specker s talk at the workshop ` information primitives and laws of nature ' , which took place at eth , zrich in may 2008 '' @xcite , p.  32 . * in ref .",
    "@xcite , cabello , severini , and winter derived some consequences from assuming this principle , showing that it provides an upper bound and sometimes singles out quantum correlations .",
    "although its fundamental role is not explicitly emphasized in @xcite , this paper seems to be the inspiration of both henson s @xcite and fritz _ et al . _",
    "s @xcite .",
    "in the following , i overview some results that suggest that the principle that pairwise decidable propositions are jointly decidable , together with boole s condition that the sum of probabilities of jointly exclusive propositions can not be higher than 1 @xcite , which i will collectively call specker s principle or simply s , may explain quantum contextuality .",
    "specifically , by that here i mean explaining why the maximum quantum value for a convex combination of joint probabilities @xcite of events whose exclusive disjunction structure is encoded in a graph @xmath3 in which events are represented by vertices and exclusive events are represented by adjacent vertices @xcite is _ exactly _ given by the lovsz number of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , as shown in @xcite . in @xcite , it is shown that the maximum satisfying s is exactly given by the fractional packing number of @xmath3 , @xmath5 when @xmath6 is the set of all cliques of @xmath3 . in this case , we will denote it as @xmath7 , while for general probabilistic theories @xmath6 is a general hypergraph .",
    "@xmath5 is defined as @xmath8 , where the maximum is taken over all @xmath9 and for all cliques @xmath10 , under the restriction @xmath11 . in order to single out structures with a quantum - classical separation ,",
    "it is useful to recall that the maximum value for classical theories is given by the independence number of @xmath3 , @xmath12",
    "these tools allow us to summarize several old and recent results in a simple way .",
    "_ specker s three - box game._what is the maximum value of the sum of probabilities that , if only two out of three boxes can be opened , one box is found empty and the other one is found full ? if the three boxes are numbered 1 , 2 , and 3 , and by @xmath13 we denote `` when boxes 1 and 2 are opened , box 1 is found full and box 2 is found empty '' , this sum can be written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the answer to the question for classical theories , quantum mechanics , and theories satisfying s is the same , since , using the language of @xcite , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the 6-verte , x graph associated to the three - box game .",
    "this graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) . however , specker noticed that in a world where s does not hold , this maximum can be @xmath20 . in the language of @xcite , this is so because @xmath21 for the @xmath6 resulting from the fact that the three boxes can not be opened simultaneously and therefore only the propositions in the same red set in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) can be decided simultaneously .",
    "_ s singles out quantum correlations in all those cases in which @xmath23._these include many important cases ( see @xcite for a list ) .",
    "for instance , the operator of the mermin inequality @xcite is equivalent to @xmath24 , where the sum is extended to all @xmath25 and @xmath26 such that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes sum modulo 2 .",
    "@xmath29 is the event `` the results @xmath30 are respectively obtained when the pairwise separated tests @xmath31 are performed '' . in this case",
    ", we have a quantum - classical separation , since @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes the complement of the shrikhande graph and is shown in fig . [ fig1 ]",
    "the maximum quantum value is singled out by s , since @xmath35 .",
    "_ s excludes pr boxes._this result was obtained in @xcite . in the language of @xcite ,",

    "@xmath39 is the graph corresponding to @xmath14 , where the sum is extended to all @xmath40 and @xmath15 such that @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum value is @xmath42=64 \\frac{6 + 4 \\sqrt{2}}{64}$ ] .",
    "@xcite studies s in other multipartite scenarios .",
    "_ s might not be enough to single out @xmath4._in @xcite , it is stated that `` navascus has a proof that the set of quantum correlations is strictly smaller than the set satisfying local orthogonality '' . without seing this proof",
    ", i can not judge whether this affects the program stated before @xcite .    _ s singles out the quantum correlations for the kcbs inequality , which is the inequality associated to the simplest graph with quantum - classical separation._this is result  1 in @xcite . in the language of @xcite",
    ", it follows from the fact that @xmath43 .      _",
    "every graph representing correlations with quantum - classical separation has , induced , ( i ) odd cycles of length 5 or more and/or ( ii ) their complements._this result was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is an open problem whether the quantum correlations of these families are singled out by s. however , the accumulated knowledge in graph theory is compatible with / suggests that the quantum correlations of family ( i)/(ii ) are singled out by s. in any case , for family ( ii ) , the difference between correlations satisfying s and quantum correlations would be unappreciable in actual experiments . in the language of @xcite ,",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath45 , for @xmath46 odd @xmath47 .",
    "if we could explain the maximum quantum contextuality of an arbitrary graph in terms of the maximum quantum contextuality of their induced elements of families ( i ) and ( ii ) @xcite , then a proof that s singles out quantum correlations for families ( i ) and ( ii ) would be a strong evidence that s may be the fundamental principle of quantum contextuality .",
    "further investigations will solve this puzzle .",
