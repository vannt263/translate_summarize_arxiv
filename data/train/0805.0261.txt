    "in this section , we discuss the different experimental ways to define diffraction at the tevatron and the lhc .    the tevatron is a @xmath1 collider located close to chicago at fermilab , usa .",
    "it is presently the collider with the highest center - of - mass energy of about 2 tev .",
    "two main experiments are located around the ring , d  and cdf . both collaborations have accumulated a luminosity larger than 3 .",
    "fb@xmath2 with an efficiency larger than 90% .    as a starting point",
    ", we describe the methods to select diffractive events used by the h1 and zeus experiments at hera , desy , hamburg in germany since it is easier . for more details about diffraction at hera , see the lectures from bernd loehr at this summer school  @xcite .",
    "hera was a collider where electrons of 27.6 gev collided with protons of 920 gev .",
    "a typical event as shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is @xmath3 where electron and jets are produced in the final state .",
    "we notice that the electron is scattered in the h1 backward detector ( in green ) whereas some hadronic activity is present in the forward region of the detector ( in the lar calorimeter and in the forward muon detectors ) .",
    "the proton is thus completely destroyed and the interaction leads to jets and proton remnants directly observable in the detector .",
    "the fact that much energy is observed in the forward region is due to colour exchange between the scattered jet and the proton remnants . in about 10% of the events , the situation is completely different .",
    "such events appear like the one shown in the bottom plot of fig .",
    "the electron is still present in the backward detector , there is still some hadronic activity ( jets ) in the lar calorimeter , but no energy above noise level is deposited in the forward part of the lar calorimeter or in the forward muon detectors . in other words , there is no color exchange between the proton and the produced jets . as an example , this can be explained if the proton stays intact after the interaction .",
    "this experimental observation leads to the first definition of diffraction : request a rapidity gap ( in other words a domain in the forward detectors where no energy is deposited above noise level ) in the forward region .",
    "for example , the d0 and cdf collaborations at the tevatron , as well as h1 and zeus at hera , use this method to select diffractive events as we will see it in the following .",
    "let us note that this approach does not insure that the proton stays intact after the interaction , but the proton could be dissociated .",
    "the advantage of the rapidity gap method is that it is quite easy to implement and it has a large acceptance in the diffractive kinematical plane .",
    "the second experimental method to detect diffractive events is also natural : the idea is to detect directly the intact proton in the final state .",
    "the proton loses a small fraction of its energy and is thus scattered at very small angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "some special detectors called roman pots can be used to detect the protons close to the beam .",
    "the basic idea is simple : the roman pot detectors are located far away from the interaction point and can move close to the beam , when the beam is stable , to detect protons scattered at vary small angles .",
    "the inconvenience is that the kinematical reach of those detectors is much smaller than with the rapidity gap method , especially at hera . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage is that it gives a clear signal of diffraction since it measures the diffracted proton directly .",
    "this method is also used at the tevatron and at hera , and such detectors are or will be installed at the lhc .    a scheme of a roman pot detector as it is used by the h1 or zeus experiment is shown in fig .",
    "the beam is the horizontal line at the upper part of the figure .",
    "the detector is located in the pot itself and can move closer to the beam when the beam is stable enough ( during the injection period , the detectors are protected in the home position ) .",
    "step motors allow to move the detectors with high precision .",
    "a precise knowledge of the detector position is necessary to reconstruct the transverse momentum of the scattered proton and thus the diffractive kinematical variables .",
    "the detectors are placed in a secondary vaccuum with respect to the beam one .",
    "the difference between diffraction at hera  @xcite and at the tevatron is that diffraction can occur not only on either @xmath4 or @xmath5 side as at hera , but also on both sides .",
    "the former case is called single diffraction whereas the other one double pomeron exchange . in the same way",
    "as the kinematical variables @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined at hera , we define @xmath8(=@xmath6 at hera ) as the proton fractional momentum loss ( or as the @xmath4 or @xmath5 momentum fraction carried by the pomeron ) , and @xmath9 , the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the interacting parton .",
    "the produced diffractive mass is equal to @xmath10 for single diffractive events and to @xmath11 for double pomeron exchange where @xmath12 is the center - of - mass energy  .",
    "the size of the rapidity gap is of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "the d  and cdf collaborations obtained their first diffractive results using the rapidity gap method which showed that the percentage of single diffractive events was of the order of 1% , and about 0.1% for double pomeron exchanges .",
    "this study was made for different experimental observables ( @xmath14 , jets , @xmath15 ... ) and was found to be always of the same order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the reconstruction of the kinematical variables is less precise than at hera if one uses the rapidity gap selection since it suffers from the worse resolution of reconstructing hadronic final states , and this method is not practical to obtain quantitative results .",
    "the starting point for the factorisation studies between hera and the tevatron is the measurement of the diffractive structure function @xmath23 at hera  @xcite .",
    "many different models are used to describe the diffractive structure functions ( two - gluon model  @xcite , dipole model  @xcite , or saturation model  @xcite ) , which are described in another lecture  @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the dokshitzer gribov lipatov altarelli parisi ( dglap )  @xcite fits to @xmath23 data .",
    "if we assume that the pomeron is made of quarks and gluons  @xcite , it is natural to check whether the dglap evolution equations are able to describe the @xmath24 evolution of these parton densities . as necessary for dglap fits , a form for the input distributions",
    "is assumed at a given @xmath25 and is evolved using the dglap evolution equations to a different @xmath24 , and fitted to the diffractive structure function data at this @xmath24 value  @xcite .",
    "the dglap qcd fit allows to get the parton distributions in the pomeron as a direct output of the fit .",
    "the quark and gluon densities in the pomeron for a @xmath24 value of 8.5 , 20 , 90 and 800 gev@xmath19 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ gluonh1 ] as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the uncertainty is displayed as a grey shaded area around the central value .",
    "we first note that the gluon density is much higher than the quark one , showing that the pomeron is gluon dominated .",
    "we also note that the gluon density at high @xmath7 is poorly constrained which is shown by the larger shaded area  @xcite .",
    "another fit using another form of input distribution is also displayed in the same figure as a black line  @xcite which shows even more the bad determination of the gluon density in the pomeron at high @xmath7 .",
    "let us note that it is possible to constrain further the gluon density in the pomeron by using in addition diffractive jet data in the fit  @xcite .",
    "even after using jet data , the uncertainty is still large at high @xmath7 ( @xmath2650% ) and we will see that this will have some consequences when we will discuss the search for exclusive events at the tevatron or the lhc .",
    "once the gluon and quark densities in the pomeron are known , it is easy to make predictions for the tevatron ( or the lhc ) if one assumes that the same mechanism is the origin of diffraction in both cases .",
    "we assume the same structure of the pomeron at hera and the tevatron and we compute as an example the jet production in single diffraction or double pomeron exchange using the parton densities in the pomeron measured at hera  @xcite .",
    "the interesting point is to see if this simple argument works or not , or in other word if the factorisation property between hera and the tevatron  using the same parton distribution functions  holds or not  @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration measured diffractive events at the tevatron and their characteristics . in general , diffractive events show as expected less qcd radiation : for instance , dijet events are more back - to - back or the difference in azimuthal angles between both jets is more peaked towards @xmath27 .",
    "to make quantitative predictions at the tevatron and the lhc , it is useful to know if factorisation holds as we mentioned in the previous section . in other words , is it possible to use the parton distributions in the pomeron obtained at hera to make predictions at the tevatron , and also further constrain the parton distribution functions in the pomeron since the reach in the diffractive kinematical plane at the tevatron and hera is different ? theoretically , factorisation is not expected to hold between the tevatron and hera  @xcite due to additional @xmath28 or @xmath1 interactions .",
    "for instance , some soft gluon exchanges between protons can occur at a longer time scale than the hard interaction and destroy the rapidity gap or the proton does not remain intact after interaction .",
    "the factorisation break - up is confirmed by comparing the percentage of diffractive events at hera and the tevatron ( 10% at hera and about 1% of single diffractive events at the tevatron ) showing already that factorisation does not hold .",
    "this introduces the concept of gap survival probability , the probability that there is no soft additional interaction or in other words that the event remains diffractive .",
    "we will mention in the following how this concept can be tested directly at the tevatron for instance .",
    "the first experimental test of factorisation concerns cdf data only .",
    "it is interesting to check whether factorisation holds within cdf data alone , or in other words if the @xmath7 and @xmath24 dependence can be factorised out from the @xmath29 one .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the percentage of diffractive events as a function of @xmath30 for different @xmath29 bins and shows the same @xmath30-dependence within systematic and statistical uncertainties in all @xmath29 bins supporting the fact that cdf data are consistent with factorisation  @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration also studied the @xmath30 dependence for different @xmath24 bins which leads to the same conclusions .",
    "this also shows that the tevatron data do not require additional secondary reggeon trajectories as in h1  @xcite .",
    "these results show that the soft interactions occuring at a much longer time scale do not depend on the hard scattering",
    ". it will be interesting to check if the same conclusions hold at the lhc .",
    "the second step is to check whether factorisation holds or not between tevatron and hera data .",
    "the measurement of the diffractive structure function is possible directly at the tevatron .",
    "the cdf collaboration measured the ratio of dijet events in single diffractive and non diffractive events , which is directly proportional to the ratio of the diffractive to the  standard \" proton structure functions",
    "@xmath31 : @xmath32 the  standard \" proton structure function is known from the usual pdfs obtained by the cteq or mrst parametrisations .",
    "the comparison between the cdf measurement ( black points , with systematics errors as shaded area ) and the expectation from the h1 qcd fits in full line is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  @xcite .",
    "we notice a discrepancy of a factor 8 to 10 between the data and the predictions from the qcd fit , showing that factorisation does not hold .",
    "however , the difference is compatible within systematic and statistical uncertainties with a constant on a large part of the kinematical plane in @xmath7 , showing that the survival probability does not seem to be @xmath7-dependent within experimental uncertainties",
    ". it would be interesting to make these studies again in a wider kinematical domain both at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "the understanding of the survival probability and its dependence on the kinematic variables is important to make precise predictions on inclusive diffraction at the lhc .",
    "the other interesting measurement which can be also performed at the tevatron is the test of factorisation between single diffraction and double pomeron exchange .",
    "the results from the cdf collaboration are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  @xcite .",
    "the left plot shows the definition of the two ratios while the right figure shows the comparison between the ratio of double pomeron exchange to single diffraction and the qcd predictions using hera data in full line . whereas factorisation was not true for the ratio of single diffraction to non diffractive events",
    ", factorisation holds for the ratio of double pomeron exchange to single diffraction ! in other words ,",
    "the price to pay for one gap is the same as the price to pay for two gaps .",
    "the survival probability , i.e. the probability not to emit an additional soft gluon after the hard interaction needs to be applied only once to require the existence of a diffractive event , but should not be applied again for double pomeron exchange .    to summarize",
    ", factorisation does not hold between hera and tevatron as expected because of the long term additional soft exchanges with respect to the the hard interaction .",
    "however , experimentally , factorisation holds with cdf data themselves and also between single diffraction and double pomeron exchange which means that the soft exchanges do not depend on the hard scattering , which is somehow natural .",
    "as we mentionned already , it is very important to test and understand the concept of survival probability .",
    "a new measurement can be performed at the tevatron , in the d  experiment , which can be decisive to test directly the concept of survival probability at the tevatron , by looking at the azimuthal distributions of the outgoing proton and antiproton with respect to the beam direction  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we display the survival probability for three different values of @xmath16 as a function of the difference in azimuthal angle between the scattered @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the upper black curve represents the case where the @xmath16 of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are similar and close to 0 . in that case , only a weak dependence on @xmath33 is observed .",
    "the conclusion is different for asymmetric cases or cases when @xmath16 is different from 0 : fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] also shows the result in full red line for the asymmetric case ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 gev@xmath19 ) , and in full and dashed blue lines for @xmath36 gev@xmath19 for two different models of survival probabilities .",
    "we notice that we get a very strong @xmath37 dependence of more than one order of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath33 dependence can be tested directly using the roman pot detectors at d  ( dipole and quadrupole detectors ) and their possibility to measure the azimuthal angles of the @xmath4 and @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the possible measurements can also be compared to expectations using another kind of model to describe diffractive events , namely soft colour interaction  @xcite .",
    "this model assumes that diffraction is not due to a colourless exchange at the hard vertex ( called pomeron ) but rather to string rearrangement in the final state during hadronisation . in this kind of model",
    ", there is a probability ( to be determined by the experiment ) that there is no string connection , and so no colour exchange , between the partons in the proton and the scattered quark produced during the hard interaction .",
    "since this model does not imply the existence of pomeron , there is no need of a concept like survival probability , and no dependence on @xmath33 of diffractive cross sections .",
    "the proposed measurement would allow to distinguish between these two drastically different models of diffraction .",
    "a schematic view of non diffractive , inclusive double pomeron exchange , exclusive diffractive events at the tevatron or the lhc is displayed in fig .  [ fig7 ] .",
    "the upper left plot shows the  standard \" non diffractive events where the higgs boson , the dijet or diphotons are produced directly by a coupling to the proton and shows proton remnants .",
    "the bottom plot displays the standard diffractive double pomeron exchange where the protons remain intact after interaction and the total available energy is used to produce the heavy object ( higgs boson , dijets , diphotons ... ) and the pomeron remnants .",
    "we have so far only discussed this kind of events and their diffractive production using the parton densities measured at hera .",
    "there may be a third class of processes displayed in the upper right figure , namely the exclusive diffractive production . in this kind of events ,",
    "the full energy is used to produce the heavy object ( higgs boson , dijets , diphotons ... ) and no energy is lost in pomeron remnants .",
    "there is an important kinematical consequence : the mass of the produced object can be computed using roman pot detectors and tagged protons :    @xmath38    we see immediately the advantage of those processes : we can benefit from the good roman pot resolution on @xmath29 to get a good resolution on mass .",
    "it is then possible to measure the mass and the kinematical properties of the produced object and use this information to increase the signal over background ratio by reducing the mass window of measurement .",
    "it is thus important to know if this kind of events exist or not .",
    "we will now describe in detail the search for exclusive events in the different channels which is performed by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron .",
    "in the next section , we will also discuss the impact of the exclusive events on the lhc physics potential .",
    "one way to look for exclusive events at the tevatron is to search for the diffractive exclusive production of light particles like the @xmath40 mesons .",
    "this would give rise to high enough cross sections ",
    "contrary to the diffractive exclusive production of heavy mass objects such as higgs bosons  to check the dynamical mechanisms and the existence of exclusive events .",
    "indeed , exclusive production of @xmath41 has been studied by the cdf collaboration  @xcite with an upper limit for the cross section of @xmath42 pb where the @xmath39 decays into @xmath15 and @xmath43 , the @xmath15 decaying itself into two muons .",
    "the experimental signature is thus two muons in the final state and an isolated photon , which is a very clear signal .",
    "unfortunately , the cosmics contamination is difficult to compute and this is why the cdf collaboration only quotes an upper limit on the @xmath39 production cross section . to know if the production is really exclusive , it is important to study the tail of inclusive diffraction which is a direct contamination of the exclusive signal .",
    "the tail of inclusive diffraction corresponds to events which show very little energy in the forward direction , or in other words where the pomeron remants carry very little energy .",
    "this is why these events can be called quasi - exclusive . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that the contamination of inclusive events into the signal region depends strongly on the assumptions on the gluon distribution in the pomeron at high @xmath7  which is very badly known as we mentioned in a previous section . therefore , this channel is unfortunately not conclusive concerning the existence of exclusive events .",
    "the cdf collaboration also looked for the exclusive production of dilepton and diphoton  @xcite .",
    "contrary to diphotons , dileptons can not be produced exclusively via pomeron exchanges since @xmath44 is possible , but @xmath45 directly is impossible .",
    "however , dileptons can be produced via qed processes , and the cross section is perfectly known .",
    "the cdf dilepton measurement is @xmath46 pb which is found to be in good agreement with qed predictions and shows that the acceptance , efficiencies of the detector are well understood .",
    "3 exclusive diphoton events have been observed by the cdf collaboration leading to a cross section of @xmath47 pb compatible with the expectations for exclusive diphoton production at the tevatron .",
    "unfortunately , the number of events is very small and the cosmics contamination uncertain .",
    "the conclusions about the existence of exclusive events are thus uncertain .",
    "this channel will be however very important for the lhc where the expected exclusive cross section is much higher .",
    "the cdf collaboration measured the so - called dijet mass fraction in dijet events  the ratio of the mass carried by the two jets produced in the event divided by the total diffractive mass  when the antiproton is tagged in the roman pot detectors and when there is a rapidity gap on the proton side to ensure that the event corresponds to a double pomeron exchange .",
    "the cdf collaboration measured this quantity for different jet @xmath48 cuts  @xcite .",
    "we compare this measurement to the expectation coming from the structure of the pomeron coming from hera .",
    "for this sake , one takes the gluon and quark densities in the pomeron measured at hera as described in ref .",
    "@xcite and the factorisation breaking between hera and the tevatron is assumed to come only through the gap survival probability ( 0.1 at the tevatron ) .    in fig .",
    "[ gluon ] , we recall the gluon and quark densities in the pomeron measured at hera . the gluon density at high @xmath7 is not well constrained from the qcd fits performed at hera . to study this uncertainty ,",
    "we multiply the gluon distribution by the factor @xmath49 as shown in fig .",
    "[ gluon ] .",
    "the @xmath50 parameter varies between -1 and 1 . for @xmath511 , the gluon density in the pomeron",
    "is enhanced at high @xmath7 whereas it is damped when @xmath521 .",
    "qcd fits to the h1 data lead to the uncertainty on the @xmath50 parameter @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "the comparison between the cdf data for a jet @xmath48 cut of 10 gev as an example and the predictions from inclusive diffraction is given in fig .",
    "[ compare2 ] , left .",
    "we also give in the same figure the effects of changing the gluon density at high @xmath7 ( by changing the value of the @xmath50 parameter ) and we note that inclusive diffraction is not able to describe the cdf data at high dijet mass fraction , even after increasing the gluon density in the pomeron at high @xmath7 ( multiplying it by @xmath54 ) , where exclusive events are expected to appear  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion remains unchanged when jets with @xmath55 gev are considered  @xcite .",

    "the gluon density is multiplied by the factor @xmath57 where @xmath50=-1 .",
    ", -0.5 , 0.5 , 1 .",
    "the default value @xmath58 is the gluon density in the pomeron determined directly by a fit to the h1 @xmath23 data with an uncertainty of about 0.5 . ]",
    "adding exclusive events to the distribution of the dijet mass fraction leads to a good description of data  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ compare2 ] , right , where we superimpose the predictions from inclusive and exclusive diffraction .",
    "this study does not prove that exclusive events exist but shows that some additional component with respect to inclusive diffraction is needed to explain cdf data .",
    "adding exclusive diffraction allows to explain the cdf measurement . to be sure of the existence of exclusive events , the observation will have to be done in different channels and the different cross sections to be compared with theoretical expectations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cdf data were also compared to the soft colour interaction models  @xcite . while the need for exclusive events is less obvious for this model , especially at high jet @xmath48",
    ", the jet rapidity distribution measured by the cdf collaboration is badly reproduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the sci model , there is a large difference between requesting an intact proton in the final state and a rapidity gap .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in the same way that higgs bosons can be produced exclusively , it is possible to produce @xmath0 , top and stop quark pairs .",
    "@xmath59 bosons are produced via qed processes which means that their cross section is well determined .",
    "on the contrary , top and stop pair production are obtained via double pomeron exchanges and the production cross section is still uncertain .    the method to reconstruct the mass of heavy objects double diffractively produced at the lhc is based on a fit to the turn - on point of the missing mass distribution at threshold  @xcite .",
    "the threshold scan is directly sensitive to the mass of the diffractively produced object ( in the @xmath59 case for instance , it is sensitive to twice the @xmath59 mass ) .",
    "the idea is thus to fit the turn - on point of the missing mass distribution which leads directly to the mass of the produced object , the @xmath59 boson .",
    "the precision of the @xmath59 mass measurement ( 0.3 gev for 300 fb@xmath2 ) is not competitive with other methods , but provides a precise check of the calibration of the roman pot detectors .",
    "@xmath59 events will also allow to assess directly the sensitivity to the photon anomalous coupling since it would reveal itself by a modification of the well - known qed @xmath59 production cross section .",
    "we can notice that the @xmath59 production cross section is proportional to the fourth power of the @xmath60 coupling which ensures a very good sensitivity of that process @xcite .",
    "the precision of the top mass measurement might however be competitive , with an expected precision better than 1 gev at high luminosity provided that the cross section is high enough .",
    "the other application is to use the so - called  threshold - scan method \" to measure the stop mass @xcite . after taking into account the stop width",
    ", we obtain a resolution on the stop mass of 0.4 , 0.7 and 4.3 gev for a stop mass of 174.3 , 210 and 393 gev for a luminosity ( divided by the signal efficiency ) of 100 fb@xmath2 provided that the cross section is high enough .",
    "the caveat is of course that the production via diffractive exclusive processes is model dependent  the production cross section dependence on mass of the produced object depends on the models  and definitely needs the tevatron and lhc data to test the models .",
    "it will allow us to determine more precisely the production cross section by testing and measuring at the tevatron the jet and photon production for high masses and high dijet or diphoton mass fraction .",
    "the motivation to install forward detectors at in atlas and cms is quite clear .",
    "it extends nicely the project of measuring the total cross sections in atlas and totem by measuring hard diffraction at high luminosity at the lhc .",
    "two locations for the forward detectors are considered at 220 and 420 m respectively to ensure a good coverage in @xmath29 or in mass of the diffractively produced object as we will see in the following .",
    "installing forward detectors at 420 m is quite challenging since the detectors will be located in the cold region of the lhc and the cryostat has to be modified to accomodate the detectors .",
    "in addition , the space available is quite small and some special mechanism called movable beam pipe are used to move the detectors close to the beam when the beam is stable enough .",
    "the situation at 220 m is easier since it is located in the warm region of the lhc and both roman pot and movable beam pipe technics can be used .",
    "the afp ( atlas forward physics ) project is under discussion in the atlas collaboration and includes both 220 and 420 m detectors on both sides of the main atlas detector .",
    "the physics motivation of this project corresponds to different domains of diffraction which we already discussed in these lectures :    * a better understanding of the inclusive diffraction mechanism at the lhc by studying in detail the structure of pomeron in terms of quarks and gluons as it was done at hera  @xcite . of great importance",
    "is also the measurement of the exclusive production of diffractive events  @xcite and its cross section in the jet channel as a function of jet transverse momentum .",
    "its understanding is necessary to control the background to higgs signal .",
    "* looking for higgs boson diffractive production in double pomeron exchange in the standard model or supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a challenging topic especially at low higgs boson masses where the higgs boson decays in @xmath61 and the standard non - diffractive search is difficult .",
    "we will detail in the following the trigger strategy .",
    "* sensitivity to the anomalous coupling of the photon by measuring the qed production cross section of @xmath0 boson pairs  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the best ways to access the anomalous coupling before the start of the ilc .",
    "photoproduction of jets can also be studied .",
    "% * other topics such as looking for stop events or measuring the top mass using the threshold scan method  @xcite which will depend strongly on the production cross section .",
    "as we mentionned in the previous section , it is needed to install movable beam pipe detectors  @xcite at 420 m. the scheme of the movable beam pipe is given in fig .",
    "[ movable ] .",
    "the principle developed originally for the zeus detector to tag electrons at low angle is quite simple and follows from the same ideas as the roman pots .",
    "the beam pipe is larger than the usual one and can host the sensitive detectors to tag the diffracted protons in the final state .",
    "when the beam is stable , the beam pipe can move so that the detectors can be closer to the beam .",
    "the movable beam pipe acts in a way as a single direction roman pot . in fig .",
    "[ movable ] , we see the beam position monitors ( bpm ) as well as the pockets where the detectors can be put .",
    "the detectors can be aligned and calibrated using the bpms as well as exclusive dimuon events.the dimuon mass can be well measured using the central muon detectors from atlas and can be compared to the result obtained using the missing mass method by tagging the final state proton in the forward detectors .",
    "this allows to calibrate the forward detectors by using data directly .",
    "the exclusive muon production cross section is expected to be high enough to allow this calibration on a store - by - store basis .",
    "the afp project proposes to install in addition some forward detectors in atlas at about 220 m on each side of the main atlas detector  @xcite .",
    "a few options are still under discussion and we will discuss only the favoured option at present . the first component is the same as at 420 m , namely the movable beam pipe containing the pockets where both the horizontal si and timing detectors can be located .",
    "however , it is not possible to use exclusive dimuon events for calibration purposes at 220 m since the cross section is too small ( the acceptance of 220 m detectors is better for high mass objects , and so higher dimuon masses , which leads to a smaller production cross section ) . for calibration and alignment ,",
    "the idea is to use bpms as before and also elastic events .",
    "the acceptance in elastic events in the horizontal detectors in the movable beam pipe is however very small , and this is why the idea is to use additional detectors ( vertical roman pots ) for calibration purposes . the vertical roman pots can be aligned using the @xmath29 distribution pointing at 0 for elastics , and the horizontal detectors in the movable beam pipe can be calibrated with respect to the vertical detectors using common events in both detectors ( halo or single diffractive events ) . with this method ,",
    "some preliminary studies show that a precision up to 5 @xmath62 m on calibration using elastics is within reach .",
    "the roman pot design follows as close as possible the design which is currently used by the totem collaboration and the luminosity group of the atlas collaboration . another design would be to have only the timing detectors in the movable beam pipes and three - arm roman pots holding the horizontal and vertical 3d si detectors .    the missing mass acceptance is given in fig .",
    "[ accept1 ] .",
    "the missing mass acceptance using only the 220 m pots starts at 135 gev , but increases slowly as a function of missing mass .",
    "it is clear that one needs both detectors at 220 and 420 m to obtain a good acceptance on a wide range of masses since most events are asymmetric ( one tag at 220 m and another one at 420 m ) . the precision on mass reconstruction using either two tags at 220 m or one tag at 220 m and another one at 420 m is of the order of 2 - 4 % on the full mass range , whereas it goes down to 1% for symmetric 420 m tags .",
    "we propose to put inside the forward detectors two kinds of detectors , namely 3d silicon detectors to measure precisely the position of the diffracted protons , and the mass of the produced object and @xmath29 , and precise timing detectors .",
    "the position detectors will consist in 3d silicon detector which allow to obtain a resolution in position better than 10 @xmath62 m .",
    "the detector is made of 10 layers of 3d si pixels of 50 @xmath63 400 @xmath62 m .",
    "one layer contains 9 pairs of columns of 160 pixels , the total size being 7.2 @xmath63 8 mm@xmath19 .",
    "the detectors will be read out by the standard atlas pixel chip  @xcite .",
    "the latency time of the chip is larger than 6 @xmath62s which gives enough time to send back the local l1 decision from the roman pots to atlas ( see the next paragraph about trigger for more detail ) , and to receive the l1 decision from atlas , which means a distance of about 440 m. it is also foressen to perform a slight modification of the chip to include the trigger possibilities into the chip .",
    "it is planed to install the roman pot together with the silicon detectors during a shut down of the lhc in 2010 .",
    "the timing detectors are necessary at the highest luminosity of the lhc to identify from which vertex the protons are coming from .",
    "it is expected that up to 35 interactions occur at the same bunch crossing and we need to identify from which interaction , or from which vertex the protons are coming from .",
    "a precision of the order of 1 mm or 2 - 5 ps is required to distinguish between the different vertices and to make sure that the diffracted protons come from the hard interactions .",
    "picosecond timing detectors are still a challenge and are developped for medical and particle physics applications .",
    "two technogies are developped , either using as a radiator  with the aim to emit photons by the diffracted protons -",
    "gas(gas cerenkov detector or gastof ) or a crystal of about 2.5 cm ( quartic ) , and the signal can be read out by micro - channel plates photomultipliers developped by photonis  @xcite .",
    "the space resolution of those detectors should be of the order of a few mm since at most two protons will be detected in those detectors for one given bunch crossing at the highest luminosity .",
    "the detectors can be read out with a constant fraction discriminator which allows to improve the timing resolution significantly compared to usual electronics . a first version of the timing detectors is expected to be ready in 2010 with a resolution of 20 - 30 ps , and the final version by 2012 - 2013 with a resolution of 2 - 5 ps .",
    "in this section , we would like to give the principle of the trigger using the roman pots at 220 m as well as the rates obtained using a simulation of the atlas detector and trigger framework  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the trigger is shown in fig .",
    "[ trig ] in the case of a higgs boson decaying into @xmath61 as an example .",
    "the first level trigger comes directly from two different 3d silicon layers in each forward detector .",
    "it is more practical to use two dedicated planes for triggering only since it allows to use different signal thresholds for trigger and readout .",
    "the idea is to send at most five strip addresses which are hit at level 1 ( to simplify the trigger procedure , we group all pixels in vertical lines as one element only for the trigger since it is enough to know the distance in the horizontal direction to have a good approximation of @xmath29 ) .",
    "a local trigger is defined at the roman pot level on each side of the atlas experiment by combining the two trigger planes in each roman pot and the roman pots as well .",
    "if the hits are found to be compatible ( not issued by noise but by real protons ) , the strip addresses are sent to atlas , which allows to compute the @xmath29 of each proton , and the diffractive mass .",
    "this information is then combined with the information coming from the central atlas detector , requesting for instance two jets above 40 gev in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ trig ] . at l2",
    ", the information coming from the timing detectors for each diffracted proton can be used and combined with the position of the main vertex of atlas to check for compatibility .",
    "once a positive atlas trigger decision is taken ( even without any diffracted proton ) , the readout informations coming from the roman pot detectors are sent to atlas as any subdetector .",
    "the different trigger possibilities for the roman pots are given below :    * _ * trigger on dpe events at 220 m : * _ this is the easiest situation since two protons can be requested at level 1 at 220 m. three different options are considered : _ - trigger on high mass higgs _ ( @xmath64 gev ) given by atlas directly ( decay in @xmath59 , @xmath65 ) , by requesting two high @xmath48 jets and two positive tags in roman pots , ( high @xmath48 jets given directly by atlas , and low @xmath48 jet special trigger for qcd studies highly prescaled ) .",
    "this configuration will not rise any problem concerning the l1 rate since most of the events will be triggered by atlas anyway , and the special diffractive triggers will be for qcd measurements and can be highly prescaled .",
    "* _ * trigger on dpe events at 220 and 420 m : * _ this is the most delicate scenario since the information from the 420 m pots can not be included at l1 because of the l1 latency time of atlas .",
    "the strategy is the following ( see table 1 ) : ( higgs ... ) decaying in @xmath61 by requesting a positive tag ( one side only ) at 220 m with @xmath66 ( due to the @xmath67 rp acceptance in @xmath29 , the proton momentum fractional loss in the @xmath68 roman pot can not be too high if the higgs mass is smaller than @xmath69 ) , and topological cuts on jets such as the exclusiveness of the process ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 are the pseudorapidities of the two l1 jets , and @xmath73 the pseudorapidity of the proton in the @xmath68 roman pots ) .",
    "this trigger can hold without prescales to a luminosity up to 2.10@xmath74 @xmath75s@xmath2 , ( single diffraction , or double pomeron exchange ) for qcd studies : can be heavily prescaled , given by atlas with lepton triggers .",
    "let us note that the rate will be of the order of a few hz at l2 by adding a cut on a presence of a tag in the 420 pots , on timing , and also on the compatibility of the rapidity of the central object computed using the jets or the protons in roman pots .",
