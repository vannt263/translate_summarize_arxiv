    "it has been generally believed that the high entropy supernova ejecta ( neutrino - driven wind ) is the likely site for the rapid neutron - capture ( @xmath0- ) process @xcite . in the previous nucleosynthesis calculations related to the neutrino - driven wind scenario ,",
    "the @xmath0-process has been examined in sufficiently high temperature conditions , such that @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the temperature in units of @xmath7  k ) .",
    "this physical condition , as well as the high neutron number density ( @xmath8  @xmath9 ) , has long been considered as the physical requirements to account for the solar @xmath0-process abundance curve @xcite . however ,",
    "if the neutrino - driven outflow becomes supersonic , the temperature can quickly fall below @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have examined the @xmath0-process in such supersonically expanding outflows by introducing the `` freezeout temperature '' @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 in units of @xmath7  k ) that mimics the abrupt wind deceleration by the preceding supernova ejecta . in their calculations , the solar @xmath0-process curve around the third abundance peak ( @xmath13 ) was best reproduced with @xmath14 , and the lower @xmath12 ( down to 0.6 ) resulted in forming a lower shifted peak .",
    "as shown in @xcite , however , it is quite possible that the wind temperature drops to a few @xmath1  k before deceleration .    in this _ letter _ , the @xmath0-process in such a low temperature environment ( hereafter `` cold @xmath0-process '' ) is explored .",
    "a semi - analytic neutrino - driven wind model @xcite is used to obtain the thermodynamic histories of outflows (   2 ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis calculations in the winds are performed with various @xmath12 including a rather low value that has not been considered in previous works (   3 ) .",
    "fundamental behaviors of the cold @xmath0-processing are then discussed in some detail . in   4 , a possible abundance feature in the cold @xmath0-process is discussed .",
    "finally , implications of this study are presented (   5 ) .",
    "the wind trajectories are obtained using the semi - analytic , spherically symmetric , general relativistic model of neutrino - driven winds @xcite .",
    "the rms average neutrino energies are taken to be 10 , 20 , and 30  mev , for electron , anti - electron , and the other flavors of neutrinos , respectively . the mass ejection rate at the neutrino sphere @xmath15",
    "is determined so that the wind becomes supersonic through the sonic point .",
    "the neutron star mass is taken to be @xmath16 .",
    "the radius of neutrino sphere is assumed to be @xmath17 as a function of neutrino luminosity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "this mimics the early time evolution of @xmath22 in hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the wind trajectories are calculated for 39 constant @xmath23 with the interval of @xmath24 . in order to link the series of constant @xmath18 trajectories to realistic time - evolving winds",
    ", @xmath18 is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the post bounce time and @xmath27  s.    the temperature and density in each wind are set to be constant when @xmath6 decreases to a given freezeout temperature @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "2a ) , in order to mimic the wind deceleration by the preceding ejecta . in this study , @xmath12 is taken to be 1.3 , 1.0 , 0.7 , 0.4 , and 0.1 .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields in each wind are obtained by solving an extensive nuclear reaction network code .",
    "the network consists of 6300 species between the proton and neutron drip lines predicted by a recent mass formula ( hfb-9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all the way from single neutrons and protons up to the @xmath28 isotopes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more detail ) .",
    "the @xmath29-decay chains and spontaneous fission processes are taken into account only after the freezeout of all other reactions @xcite .",
    "neutron - induced and @xmath4-delayed fissions , as well as the contribution of fission fragments to the lighter nuclei , are neglected .",
    "each nucleosynthesis calculation is initiated when the temperature decreases to @xmath30 , at which only free nucleons exist .",
    "the initial compositions are then given by the initial electron fraction @xmath31 ( number of proton per nucleon ) . in order to mimic the hydrodynamic results",
    "@xcite , @xmath31 is assumed to be @xmath32 . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are taken to be 0.50 and 0.15 , respectively .",
    "the latter is rather smaller than that in hydrodynamic results ( e.g. , @xmath35 in * ? ? ?",
    "this extreme assumption is to obtain the heavy @xmath0-nuclei abundances with a typical neutron star mass ( @xmath36 ) for the current purpose .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields in each @xmath12 case are mass - averaged over the 39 wind trajectories weighted by @xmath37 .",
    "figure  1 compares the mass - averaged yields with the solar @xmath0-process abundances as functions of atomic mass number .",
    "we find that , for @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "1a ) , the third - peak abundances shift to the high side from @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the abundance curve is unacceptably jagged compared to the solar @xmath0-process pattern . for @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , the third - peak abundances fit the solar @xmath0-process pattern quite well . for @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "1c ) , however , the third - peak abundances slightly shift to the low side from @xmath13 .",
    "this can be understood within the classical picture of @xmath0-process , in which the @xmath41-@xmath42 equilibrium is justified .",
    "that is , for lower @xmath12 , the @xmath0-process path locates at the more neutron - rich side on the nuclide chart . as a result",
    ", the freezeout at @xmath43 takes place at lower @xmath44 ( i.e. , lower @xmath45 ) . among the above three cases",
    ", @xmath39 can be regarded as a reasonable choice to reproduce the heavy @xmath0-process nuclei in the solar system .",
    "we find , however , that this interpretation does not hold in the lower @xmath12 cases .",
    "the @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "1d ) case reproduces the third - peak abundances even better than the @xmath40 case .",
    "moreover , for @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "1e ) , the third - peak abundances nicely fit the solar @xmath0-process curve .",
    "this is a consequence of the cold @xmath0-processing as discussed below .",
    "figure  2 shows some key physical quantities as functions of time ( @xmath48 at @xmath30 ) in the @xmath49 case .",
    "the asymptotic entropy per nucleon in this wind is only 92 ( in units of the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "however , the ( artificial ) low initial @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) leads to a high neutron - to - seed ratio @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) at the beginning of the @xmath0-process ( @xmath54 ) . here , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the abundances of free neutrons and the heavy nuclei ( @xmath57 ) , respectively . at @xmath58 ,",
    "the abundance - averaged mass number of the heavy nuclei is 103 .",
    "this is thus taken to be representative of the third - peak forming winds . on each line in figure  2 ,",
    "open and filled triangles denote the times when @xmath52 decreases to 80 and 10 , respectively .",
    "the former and latter approximately correspond to the epochs at which the second ( @xmath59 ) and third ( @xmath13 ) peaks form , respectively .",
    "open circles denote the time when @xmath52 decreases to unity , which is referred to as `` @xmath60-exhaustion '' .",
    "no heavier nuclei are synthesized beyond this stage , but the rearrangement of the local abundance distribution continues .    the ratios @xmath61 and @xmath62 in each case are shown in figures  2c and 2d , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are the abundance - averaged mean lifetimes of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath4-decay for @xmath57 nuclei , respectively ( see eqs .  ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "these represent the lifetimes of the dominant species at a given time . the condition @xmath66 is referred to as `` freezeout '' ( _ filled circles _ ; fig .  2 ) .",
    "the abundance curve fixes at this time .",
    "note that the classical @xmath0-process is characterized by the conditions @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    as can be seen in figure  2c , the second peak forms at @xmath69  s in all cases , where @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the second peak forms under the condition of the @xmath70-@xmath42 equilibrium . for @xmath71 ,",
    "this condition holds during the whole stage of the @xmath0-process . for @xmath39 ,",
    "@xmath61 slightly decreases after @xmath60-exhaustion and a quasi @xmath41-@xmath42 equilibrium continues until freezeout . for @xmath40 ,",
    "@xmath61 slightly decreases after the second - peak formation and a quasi equilibrium continues by the third - peak formation . in these cases , therefore , the temperature is enough high to maintain the ( quasi ) @xmath41-@xmath42 equilibrium during the major @xmath0-process phase .",
    "hereafter , the @xmath39 case is taken to be representative of the @xmath0-process in a high temperature environment ( hereafter `` hot @xmath0-process '' ) .",
    "in contrast , in lower @xmath12 cases , @xmath61 quickly drops below unity and the @xmath41-@xmath42 equilibrium is never achieved after the second - peak formation .",
    "this is due to the quickly decreasing @xmath6 and @xmath72 , in which the @xmath72-@xmath6 condition abruptly falls off the `` waiting point validity boundary '' @xcite .",
    "the temperature does not play any roles in such an environment , which is thus designated as the cold @xmath0-process .",
    "hereafter , the @xmath47 case is taken to be representative of the cold @xmath0-process .",
    "one may consider that , without photodisintegration , the @xmath0-process path approaches the neutron - drip line and the third peak shifts to the rather low side from @xmath13 .",
    "the reason for this misunderstanding can be found in figure  2d , where the lifetimes of @xmath4-decay and of neutron capture are compared .",
    "the hot @xmath0-process satisfies the classical @xmath0-process condition @xmath73 . in the cold @xmath0-process ,",
    "however , @xmath74 is only a few times larger than @xmath75 , in which the neutron capture competes with the @xmath4-decay .",
    "this is due to the quickly decreasing @xmath72 in the supersonically expanding wind .",
    "consequently , the nucleosynthetic path of the cold @xmath0-process is pushed back and locates at a similar position to that of the hot @xmath0-process .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  2e that shows the @xmath0-process path in each case in terms of the neutron separation energy . here ,",
    "@xmath76 ( two - neutron separation energy divided by two ) is abundance - averaged for the @xmath57 nuclei ( @xmath77 ) , which approximately represents the nucleosynthetic path at a given time and 0.1 are available from http//supernova.astron.s.u - tokyo.ac.jp/~wanajo / research.html . ] .",
    "that is , @xmath78 is the neutron - drip line , while a higher @xmath77 locates at closer to the @xmath4-stability .",
    "the path obtained from the @xmath41-@xmath42 equilibrium condition ( @xmath79 , eq .",
    "( 3 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for each is also plotted , which poorly predicts the _ real _ path for the cold @xmath0-process .",
    "the cold @xmath0-process takes a significantly higher @xmath77 than @xmath79 owing to a push - back by @xmath4-decay . as a result ,",
    "both the cold and hot @xmath0-processes trace similar @xmath77 histories .",
    "notably , the freezeout in the @xmath39 and 0.1 cases takes place at similar @xmath77 values . as a consequence ,",
    "similar @xmath0-process curves appear as can be seen in figures  1b and 1e .",
    "note that , for @xmath47 , freezeout occurs at @xmath80 .",
    "hence , any @xmath81 cases would result in the identical abundance curve .",
    "the abundance differences between the hot and cold @xmath0-processes become further small when plotted as functions of atomic number .",
    "figure  3 compares the mass - averaged abundances with the solar @xmath0-process curve and the measured elements in the @xmath0-process - rich galactic halo star cs  31082 - 001 .",
    "all cases , except for @xmath82 , are in reasonable agreement with the solar @xmath0-process and measured patterns .",
    "this may support the robustness of the abundance curves found in the @xmath0-process - rich stars .",
    "note that the total mass of the @xmath0-process nuclei ( @xmath83 ) is the same for all cases ( @xmath84 ) , since the seed abundances ( @xmath85 ) are already produced at @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the mass fractions of some measurable elements ( and @xmath88pt ) are presented in table  1 , which also shows a small variation between the hot and cold @xmath0-processes ( up to a factor of two , except for @xmath71 ) .",
    "these differences are small enough , when considering the uncertainties in the nuclear data as well as in the outflow conditions .",
    "we can see , however , a distinctive feature in the abundance curves around @xmath89 ( before @xmath29-decay ; _ black lines _ in fig .  1 ) between the hot and cold @xmath0-processes .",
    "this is due to their different freezeout histories ( fig .",
    "the hot @xmath0-process ( _ red line _ ) follows a low @xmath77 ( @xmath90  mev ) path at @xmath60-exhaustion . at this @xmath77 path",
    ", a trough at @xmath91 appears in the abundance curve ( before @xmath29-decay , fig .",
    "this is a consequence that the nuclei at @xmath92 are predicted to be unstable against neutron capture ( see the iso-@xmath76 curves in fig .  6 , * ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",

    ". therefore , the trough shifts to @xmath94 .",
    "the trough is further eroded by neutron capture without push - back by photodisintegration . as a consequence , the parent nuclei of pb ( @xmath95 and 234 ; fig .",
    "1e ) result in being significantly deficient .",
    "this may lead to a visible difference in the pb production ( fig .  3 and table  1 ) , despite the similar th+u values ( fig .",
    "1 ) when the current nuclear data set is utilized .",
