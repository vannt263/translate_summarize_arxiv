    "the search for new quark flavors remains an important and interesting task .",

    "the @xmath0-parameter only restricts the possible mass - splitting and the limit on the ` number of neutrinos ' refers to light ones only .",
    "in fact , some guts even require quarks that do not fit into the standard model scheme .",
    "because charm as well as bottom have been discovered through hadronic production of their quarkonium bound states @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , some authors @xcite examined the prospects for discovering new flavors at future hadron colliders through a similar mechanism .",
    "given favorable circumstances , gluon fusion would be the dominant source for quarkonium production and therefore especially the pseudoscalar ground state @xmath3 could be produced with sufficient rate . also the @xmath4 state @xmath5 might be accessible .    for the lighter member of a fourth generation doublet the single quark decay ,",
    "i.e.  the decay of one of the constituents in the quarkonium , is likely to be suppressed due to small intergeneration mixing angles .",
    "thus one may in a first step ignore this channel and only consider the annihilation decays .",
    "the latter include some new and distinctive modes which may even become dominant .",
    "the most important one could be @xmath6 , which might even offer a way to discover the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "predictions for the decays @xmath7 have been derived in born approximation in references @xcite .",
    "qcd corrections , however , are only partly known .",
    "the aim of this work is to fill this gap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the calculational method employed can be found in @xcite and will be discussed only briefly in the following section ii , together with some general considerations . in section",
    "iii the results of our calculations will be presented .",
    "compact approximations will be given in section iv , a brief summary in section v.",
    "not yet discovered quarks must be heavy and a nonrelativistic treatment of their bound states is adequate . as is well known , in this case the decay width of an s - wave bound state factorizes into a nonperturbative part  the wavefunction at the origin  and a perturbative part which is proportional to the free quark scattering cross section : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the relative velocity of the @xmath10 system and @xmath11 the free scattering amplitude .",
    "the factorization in this form applies for s - states only ( for p - states see @xcite ) and to the order considered in this paper .",
    "relativistic corrections first enter at @xmath12 , not considered in this work .",
    "there are several ways to calculate the rate : one is to simply compute the spin averaged cross section ( with a modified statistical factor @xmath13 where @xmath14 refers to the spin of the bound state ) , if only the desired spin configurations can contribute to the sum .",
    "this may require care concerning possible couplings .",
    "consider for example the @xmath15-mode : among the s waves only the spin 1 state with @xmath16 can decay that way , and the approach is straightforward .",
    "however , if we switch to the @xmath17-mode , both states with @xmath18 and @xmath16 are present in the sum , albeit with unknown relative weight . in this case one may identify the parity violating part @xmath19 in the amplitude with the @xmath3 decay , the part @xmath20 with @xmath5 .",
    "a second way is to project the appropriate amplitudes using the method derived in @xcite .",
    "both methods were used to obtain and check the results given below , with the exception of the decays into two @xmath21s .",
    "there only the second one was applied because the separation of the various couplings is inconvenient .",
    "the calculation of the wavefunction @xmath22 requires the knowledge of the qcd potential .",
    "to get rid of the dependence on the potential model all widths are normalized to @xmath23 and only the ratios @xmath24 are presented .",
    "the zeroth order generic feynman diagrams responsible for the annihilation decays are shown in fig .",
    "[ borns ] . the decay through the virtual photon or @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ borns](a ) ) contributes only to the channel @xmath26 , the decay through the virtual higgs ( fig .",
    "[ borns](b ) ) is shown only for completeness .",
    "it contributes neither to @xmath3 nor to @xmath5 decays because of its quantum numbers ( this only applies to a standard model higgs , of course ) .",
    "first order qcd corrections receive contributions from the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "their sum is infrared finite .",
    "real gluon emission is forbidden by color conservation . comparing this result with the calculation of qed corrections , which is practically the same in this order",
    ", we could also argue that the coupling of real gluons ( photons ) to a color ( electrically ) neutral state vanishes in the static limit , thus providing an infrared finite answer .",
    "however , as expected , all corrections exhibit the coulomb singularity , e.g. @xmath27 which is universal , proportional to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is a color factor ) , and which originates from box- and from s - channel vertex correction diagrams ( figs .",
    "[ qcds](a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "this divergence actually represents part of the bethe - salpeter wavefunction and must be dropped since it is already included in the factor @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , since we are calculating ratios of decay widths , the singularities ( formally ) cancel anyway .",
    "the k - factors for the ratios @xmath31 , and their nontrivial parts @xmath32 , which are defined through    @xmath33    will thus be free from coulomb singularities .",
    "the corrected rate can then be obtained from @xmath34    at this point a comment on the regularization the coulomb singularity is appropriate .",
    "two different procedures are possible : one may either start with nonvanishing @xmath35 and consider the limit @xmath36 in the end , which obviously requires significantly more effort during the calculation than really needed , in particular for the box diagram .",
    "alternatively one may set @xmath37 from the outset and employ a nonvanishing gluon mass @xmath38 .",
    "this second procedure has several advantages : the coulomb singularity and the infrared divergences are regularized in one step and the special kinematical situation facilitates the calculation ( especially of the box diagram ) significantly . to connect the two approaches the vertex correction can be investigated .",
    "this leads to the substitution rule @xmath39    before the results of the calculations can be presented , the notation must be fixed .",
    "vector and axial vector coupling constants are abreviated with the help of @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the quark charge divided by the proton charge , @xmath42 ( the 3-component of ) the weak isospin and @xmath43 the weak mixing angle . the results are applicable to fourth generation quarkonia as well as to more unconventional quarks ( for example an isosinglet in @xmath44 models ) as long as the couplings to the higgs boson coincide with those of the standard model .",
