    "this paper is a combinatorial and computational study of the tropical moduli spaces @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the tropical torelli map .    there is , of course , a vast ( to say the least ) literature on the subjects of algebraic curves and moduli spaces in algebraic geometry . for example , two well - studied objects are the moduli space @xmath4 of smooth projective complex curves of genus @xmath1 and the moduli space @xmath5 of @xmath1-dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties .",
    "the torelli map @xmath6 then sends a genus @xmath1 algebraic curve to its jacobian , which is a certain @xmath1-dimensional complex torus .",
    "the image of @xmath7 is called the torelli locus or the schottky locus .",
    "the problem of how to characterize the schottky locus inside @xmath5 is already very deep .",
    "see , for example , the survey of grushevsky @xcite .",
    "the perspective we take in this paper is the perspective of tropical geometry @xcite . from this viewpoint ,",
    "one replaces algebraic varieties with piecewise - linear or polyhedral objects .",
    "these latter objects are amenable to combinatorial techniques , but they still carry information about the former ones . roughly speaking , the information they carry has to do with what is happening `` at the boundary '' or `` at the missing points '' of the algebraic object .    for example , the tropical analogue of @xmath4 , denoted @xmath0 , parametrizes certain weighted metric graphs , and it has a poset of cells corresponding to the boundary strata of the deligne - mumford compactification @xmath8 of @xmath4 . under this correspondence , a stable curve @xmath9 in @xmath8",
    "is sent to its so - called dual graph .",
    "the irreducible components of @xmath9 , weighted by their geometric genus , are the vertices of this graph , and each node in the intersection of two components is recorded with an edge .",
    "the correspondence in genus @xmath10 is shown in figure [ f : m_2 ] . a rigorous proof of this correspondence was given by caporaso in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3 ) .",
    "we remark that the correspondence above yields dual graphs that are just graphs , not metric graphs .",
    "there is not yet in the literature a sensible way to equip these graphs with edge lengths and thus produce an actual tropicalization map @xmath11 .",
    "so for now , the correspondence between @xmath8 and @xmath0 is not as tight as it ultimately should be .",
    "however , we anticipate that forthcoming work on berkovich spaces by baker , payne , and rabinoff will address this interesting point .",
    "the starting point of this paper is the recent paper by brannetti , melo , and viviani @xcite . in that paper , the authors rigorously define a plausible category for tropical moduli spaces called stacky fans .",
    "( the term `` stacky fan '' is due to the authors of @xcite , and is unrelated , as far as we know , to the construction of borisov , chen , and smith in @xcite ) .",
    "they further define the tropical versions @xmath0 and @xmath2 of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and a tropical torelli map between them , and prove many results about these objects , some of which we will review here .",
    "preceding that paper is the foundational work of mikhalkin in @xcite and of mikhalkin and zharkov @xcite , in which tropical curves and jacobians were first introduced and studied in detail .",
    "the notion of tropical curves in @xcite is slightly different from the original definition , in that curves now come equipped with vertex weights .",
    "we should also mention the work of caporaso @xcite , who proves geometric results on @xmath0 considered just as a topological space , and caporaso and viviani @xcite , who prove a tropical torelli theorem stating that the tropical torelli map is `` mostly '' injective , as originally conjectured in @xcite .    in laying the groundwork for the results we will present here , we ran into some inconsistencies in @xcite .",
    "it seems that the definition of a stacky fan there is inadvertently restrictive . in fact",
    ", it excludes @xmath0 and @xmath2 themselves from being stacky fans .",
    "also , there is a topological subtlety in defining @xmath2 , which we will address in  4.4 .",
    "thus , we find ourself doing some foundational work here too .",
    "we begin in section 2 by recalling the definition in @xcite of the tropical moduli space @xmath0 and presenting computations , summarized in theorem [ t : comp ] , for @xmath12 . with @xmath0 as a motivating example , we attempt a better definition of stacky fans in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we define the space @xmath2 , recalling the beautiful combinatorics of voronoi decompositions along the way , and prove that it is hausdorff .",
    "note that our definition of this space , definition [ d : ag ] , is different from the one in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2 ) , and it corrects a minor error there . in section 5 , we study the combinatorics of the zonotopal subfan .",
    "we review the tropical torelli map in section 6 ; theorem [ t : sch ] presents computations on the tropical schottky locus for @xmath12 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 compare the number of cells in the stacky fans @xmath0 , the schottky locus , and @xmath2 for @xmath12 . in section 7 , we partially answer a question suggested by diane maclagan : we give finite - index covers of @xmath13 and @xmath3 that satisfy a tropical - type balancing condition .",

    "in this section , we review the construction in @xcite of the moduli space of tropical curves of a fixed genus @xmath1 ( see also @xcite ) . this space is denoted @xmath0 .",
    "then , we present explicit computations of these spaces in genus up to  @xmath15 .",
    "we will see that the moduli space @xmath0 is not itself a tropical variety , in that it does not have the structure of a balanced polyhedral fan ( ( * ? ? ? * definition 3.3.1 ) )",
    ". that would be too much to expect , as it has automorphisms built in to its structure that precisely give rise to `` stackiness . ''",
    "contrast this with the situation of moduli space @xmath16 of tropical rational curves with @xmath17 marked points , constructed and studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as expected by analogy with the classical situation , this latter space is well known to have the structure of a tropical variety that comes from the tropical grassmannian @xmath18 .      before constructing the moduli space of tropical curves ,",
    "let us review the definition of a tropical curve .",
    "first , recall that a * metric graph * is a pair @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a finite connected graph , loops and parallel edges allowed , and @xmath21 is a function @xmath22 on the edges of @xmath20 .",
    "we view @xmath21 as recording lengths of the edges of @xmath20 .",
    "the * genus * of a graph @xmath20 is the rank of its first homology group : @xmath23    a * tropical curve * @xmath9 is a triple @xmath24 , where @xmath19 is a metric graph ( so @xmath20 is connected ) , and @xmath25 is a weight function @xmath26 on the vertices of @xmath20 , with the property that every weight zero vertex has degree at least 3 .    two tropical curves @xmath24 and @xmath27 are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism of graphs @xmath28 that preserves edge lengths and preserves vertex weights .",
    "we are interested in tropical curves only up to isomorphism .",
    "when we speak of a tropical curve , we will really mean its isomorphism class .    given a tropical curve @xmath29 ,",
    "write @xmath30 then the * genus * of @xmath9 is defined to be @xmath31 the * combinatorial type * of @xmath9 is the pair @xmath32 , in other words , all of the data of @xmath9 except for the edge lengths .",
    "informally , we view a weight of @xmath33 at a vertex @xmath34 as @xmath33 loops , based at @xmath34 , of infinitesimally small length .",
    "each infinitesimal loop contributes once to the genus of @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the property that only vertices with positive weight may have degree 1 or 2 amounts to requiring that , were the infinitesimal loops really to exist , every vertex would have degree at least 3 .",
    "permitting vertex weights will ensure that the moduli space @xmath0 , once it is constructed , is complete .",
    "that is , a sequence of genus @xmath1 tropical curves obtained by sending the length of a loop to zero will still converge to a genus @xmath1 curve .",
    "of course , the real reason to permit vertex weights is so that the combinatorial types of genus @xmath1 tropical curves correspond precisely to dual graphs of stable curves in @xmath8 , as discussed in the introduction and in ( * ? ? ? * section 5.3 ) .",
    "see figure [ f : m_2 ] .",
    "are fixed positive real numbers.,width=336 ]    figure [ f : curve ] shows an example of a tropical curve @xmath9 of genus 3 .",
    "note that if we allow the edge lengths @xmath21 to vary over all positive real numbers , we obtain all tropical curves of the same combinatorial type as @xmath9 .",
    "this motivates our construction of the moduli space of tropical curves below .",
    "we will first group together curves of the same combinatorial type , obtaining one cell for each combinatorial type .",
    "then , we will glue our cells together to obtain the moduli space .",
    "fix @xmath35 .",
    "our goal now is to construct a moduli space for genus @xmath1 tropical curves , that is , a space whose points correspond to tropical curves of genus @xmath1 and whose geometry reflects the geometry of the tropical curves in a sensible way .",
    "the following construction is due to the authors of  @xcite .",
    "first , fix a combinatorial type @xmath32 of genus @xmath1 .",
    "what is a parameter space for all tropical curves of this type ?",
    "our first guess might be a positive orthant @xmath36 , that is , a choice of positive length for each edge of @xmath20 .",
    "but we have overcounted by symmetries of the combinatorial type @xmath32 .",
    "for example , in figure [ f : curve ] , @xmath37 and @xmath38 give the same tropical curve .",
    "furthermore , with foresight , we will allow lengths of zero on our edges as well , with the understanding that a curve with some zero - length edges will soon be identified with the curve obtained by contracting those edges .",
    "this suggests the following definition .",
    "given a combinatorial type @xmath32 , let the * automorphism group * @xmath39 be the set of all permutations @xmath40 that arise from weight - preserving automorphisms of @xmath20 .",
    "that is , @xmath39 is the set of permutations @xmath41 that admit a permutation @xmath42 which preserves the weight function @xmath25 , and such that if an edge @xmath43 has endpoints @xmath34 and @xmath25 , then @xmath44 has endpoints @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "now , the group @xmath39 acts naturally on the set @xmath47 , and hence on the orthant @xmath48 , with the latter action given by permuting coordinates .",
    "we define @xmath49 to be the topological quotient space @xmath50    next , we define an equivalence relation on the points in the union @xmath51 as @xmath32 ranges over all combinatorial types of genus @xmath1 .",
    "regard a point @xmath52 as an assignment of lengths to the edges of @xmath20 .",
    "now , given two points @xmath52 and @xmath53 , identify @xmath54 and @xmath55 if one of them is obtained from the other by contracting all edges of length zero .",
    "note that contracting a loop , say at vertex @xmath34 , means deleting that loop and adding 1 to the weight of @xmath34 .",
    "contracting a nonloop edge , say with endpoints @xmath56 and @xmath57 , means deleting that edge and identifying @xmath56 and @xmath57 to obtain a new vertex whose weight is @xmath58 .",
    "finally , let @xmath59 be the smallest equivalence relation containing the identification we have just defined .",
    "now we glue the cells @xmath49 along @xmath59 to obtain our moduli space :    the * moduli space * @xmath0 is the topological space @xmath60 where the disjoint union ranges over all combinatorial types of genus @xmath1 , and @xmath59 is the equivalence relation defined above .",
    "in fact , the space @xmath0 carries additional structure : it is an example of a stacky fan .",
    "we will define the category of stacky fans in section  3 .",
    ".,width=384 ]    figure [ f : m2_fan ] is a picture of @xmath61 .",
    "its cells are quotients of polyhedral cones ; the dotted lines represent symmetries , and faces labeled by the same combinatorial type are in fact identified .",
    "the poset of cells , which we will investigate next for higher @xmath1 , is shown in figure  [ f : m_2 ] .",
    "it has two vertices , two edges and two @xmath10-cells .",
    "our next goal will be to compute the space @xmath0 for @xmath1 at most 5 .",
    "the computations were done in mathematica , and the code is available at @xmath62    what we compute , to be precise , is the partially ordered set @xmath63 on the cells of @xmath0 .",
    "this poset is defined in lemma  [ l : pg ] below .",
    "our results , summarized in theorem [ t : comp ] below , provide independent verification of the first six terms of the sequence a174224 in @xcite , which counts the number of tropical curves of genus @xmath1 : @xmath64 this sequence , along with much more data along these lines , was first obtained by maggiolo and pagani by an algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "given two combinatorial types @xmath32 and @xmath65 of genus @xmath1 , we say that @xmath65 is a * specialization * , or * contraction * , of @xmath32 , if it can be obtained from @xmath32 by a sequence of edge contractions . here , contracting a loop means deleting it and adding 1 to the weight of its base vertex ; contracting a nonloop edge , say with endpoints @xmath56 and @xmath57 , means deleting the edge and identifying @xmath56 and @xmath57 to obtain a new vertex whose weight we set to @xmath66 .",
    "[ l : pg ] the relation of specialization on genus @xmath1 combinatorial types yields a graded partially ordered set @xmath63 on the cells of @xmath0 . the rank of a combinatorial type @xmath32 is @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that we obtain a poset ; furthermore , @xmath65 is covered by @xmath32 precisely if @xmath65 is obtained from @xmath32 by contracting a single edge .",
    "the formula for rank then follows .    for example",

    "the poset @xmath69 is shown in figure [ f : m_3 ] .",
    "it is color - coded according to the torelli map , as explained in section 6 .",
    "-0.1 in    our goal is to compute @xmath63 .",
    "we do so by first listing its maximal elements , and then computing all possible specializations of those combinatorial types . for the first step , we use proposition 3.2.4(i ) in @xcite , which characterizes the maximal cells of @xmath0 : they correspond precisely to combinatorial types @xmath70 , where @xmath20 is a connected @xmath71-regular graph of genus @xmath1 , and @xmath72 is the zero weight function on @xmath73 .",
    "connected , @xmath71-regular graphs of genus @xmath1 are equivalently characterized as connected , @xmath71-regular graphs on @xmath74 vertices .",
    "these have been enumerated :    the number of maximal cells of @xmath0 is equal to the @xmath75 term in the sequence @xmath76    this is sequence a005967 in @xcite , whose @xmath77 term is the number of connected @xmath71-regular graphs on @xmath78 vertices .",
