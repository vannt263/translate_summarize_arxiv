    "the article `` postmodernity and affect : all dressed up with no place to go '' published by lawrence grossberg in 1988 addresses the altered view of emotions in the postmodern society @xcite .",
    "but `` the place to go '' has considerably changed since .",
    "instead of meeting other people at preferred locations , the internet has become the most important `` place '' to show oneself dressed up , either as a real - name person or with a fake identity , but still with certain desires , goals , or feelings .",
    "in fact , the internet is increasingly recognized not only as a tool that people use , but as an environment where they function and live .",
    "the amount of time , energy and emotions spent on using online social networks @xcite , online games @xcite , emails @xcite , blogs @xcite and chats @xcite are getting unprecedented scores .",
    "hence the social implications of the internet @xcite , the intricate relationships between the real and the virtual worlds @xcite , and mechanisms governing new techno - social phenomena @xcite pose new challenges for scientific research .",
    "the social sciences faced with the problem of transferring concepts of `` offline '' human behaviors into the online world of social networks @xcite .",
    "the question whether humans behave completely different when becoming `` users '' is tackled in various empirical investigations @xcite .",
    "a particular question regards the emotional interaction between users in online social networks : how is emotional influence exerted if mostly written text is exchanged ?",
    "what kind of emotions are actually involved ? what is the role of the underlying network structure in spreading emotions ? therefore , study of the stochastic processes related with stepping of the users into the virtual world and spreading of their behaviors and emotions through the online social network , are of key importance",
    ".    in our recent work @xcite , hereafter referred as i , we have compiled and analysed large dataset containing the dialogs from ` myspace ` social network , currently ranked as the fourth largest social networking site after ` facebook ` , ` google+ ` , and ` linkedin ` . combining the methods of statistical physics with machine learning approach of text analysis , by which the emotional content of the messages was extracted , we have found strong evidence of user s collective behaviors in which emotions are involved .",
    "specifically , bursts of emotional messages occur , which obey scaling laws and temporal correlations .",
    "furthermore , dominance of positive emotions and specific structure of the dialogs - based network was revealed . in this work we use agent - based framework with emotional agents",
    "@xcite , and explicitly investigate the mechanisms of the emotional influence between agents in the online social network , which is underlying the observed collective behaviors of users .    in general , we observe that many models of social interaction are based on the kiss approach ( `` keep it simple and stupid '' ) .",
    "in contrast to these simple approaches , our model is specifically designed to describe the emotional interaction in ` myspace ` , which is certainly different from other online platforms , such as blogs , or fora .",
    "we do not try to simplify the system and this way get rid of all the specific features . on the contrary , we want to build up a model that as much as possible includes these specific features , such as , e.g. , directed communication through message walls .",
    "consequently , some of the assumptions used in our model read quite complicated on the first glimpse , but try to capture real interactions in larger detail .",
    "this restricts of course the possible generalization to other online platforms , which is not the aim of the paper .",
    "agent based approaches are gaining importance among the psychologist community @xcite . our modeling framework has already proved its applicability for various online communications , e.g. emotional influence in chats @xcite , product reviews @xcite and dynamics of blogs @xcite .",
    "it is based on the concept of brownian agents @xcite which are described by two scalar variables , _ valence _ that describes the pleasure ( attractiveness and aversiveness ) associated with an emotion , and _ arousal _ that describes the activity level induced by the emotion . our focus on valence and arousal to quantify emotions is motivated by russel s model @xcite from psychology . in our modeling framework",
    "stochastic equations for both variables are proposed to account for random influences .",
    "their deterministic parts result from the direct and indirect emotional interaction between agents and needs to be specified according to the online system considered .",
    "importantly , the nonlinear functions of the deterministic part capture the response of an agent to emotional information .",
    "the latter is modeled as a time - dependent field that is generated by agents posting emotional text , this way comprising valence and arousal of different agents .",
    "the response functions specify what of this information field actually affects a specific agent . while in some cases , such as fora communication ,",
    "a mean - field approach is most appropriate , i.e. all agents can see all information , the new feature of the model proposed here is in the network communication , i.e. agents can only see very specific information of `` friends '' , which are different for every agent .",
    "this makes the model more complicated compared to fora communication , but it still follows the general outline of the framework of emotional influence . in this respect , mathematical complexity of the present model , with the _ emotional agents on a fixed network _ , lies in between two previously studied cases .",
    "on one side , the dynamics of blogs where the agent s actions cause the network on which they are situated to evolve @xcite , and on the other , the product review communications where the agents are not exposed to any geometrical constraints @xcite .",
    "the model proposed in this paper is linked to empirical observations in ` myspace ` in various ways .",
    "first , it takes some empirical findings as _ input _ for the computer simulations , in particular the network of interactions which has been extracted from the dataset @xcite . to have this as",
    "a realistic feature is quite important because hidden topology features , such as link correlations at next - neighborhood level , affect the spreading of information and other relaxation dynamics in complex networks @xcite .",
    "a second important empirical input regards the temporal activity patterns of users , which are known to display some universal features across different communication media @xcite .",
    "the _ output _ of our computer simulations is also to be compared to empirical findings .",
    "importantly , the creation and exchange of all emotional messages results in a valence distribution , which allows a comparison of empirics and simulation on the aggregated level . for the empirical analysis ,",
    "the emotional information captured in the user s messages has been extracted by means of sentiment analysis algorithms @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the analysis in ref .",
    "i , where only the emotion _ valence _ is considered and accurately graded by the emotion classifiers @xcite , for the comparison of the simulated and empirical data here we need a new classifier in which both _ valence and arousal _ of the messages are determined simultaneously . therefore we introduce a lexicon - based classifier which is not as accurate as the valence classification , but it provides two values , valence and arousal , from a written text .",
    "note that , according to psychology literature @xcite , these two components can already define a commonly known emotion , e.g. , `` fear '' , `` shame '' , `` delight '' , etc .",
    "secondly , our model simulates the response of the social network to external emotional events which allows to quantify the time scale for the emergence of collective emotions .",
    "the resulting power spectrum can be compared to empirical data .    in the following section",
    ", we first describe the empirical findings from the ` myspace ` dataset that are relevant for the modeling part .",
    "the agent based model and its numerical implementation are described in sect .",
    "[ sec - model ] , while the results of computer simulation and their comparison to empirical findings are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec - simulations ] .",
    "a general discussion concludes the paper .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the underlying network structure may crucially affect the diffusion processes on it , e.g. , by imposing `` topology traps '' and channeling the process according to its higher topology structures .",
    "therefore , to obtain reliable dynamic features of the emotion spreading process , the realistic network structure is considered .",
    "the network we use for the modeling in sect .",
    "[ sec - model ] is obtained from the social networking site ` myspace ` .",
    "the data are collected by a parametrized algorithm with a specified depth ( time - window of the dialogs ) and the network diameter in paper i @xcite . in ` myspace ` , users can become `` friends '' by requesting and accepting friendship proposals .",
    "each user has a wall on which all his or her friends can post messages directed to the wall s owner . according to ` myspace ` policy , each user can also see his or her friends walls , in addition to its own wall . from the automatically retrieved dataset of publicly available messages between users , which we described in ref .",
    "i , the social network is reconstructed .",
    "the users are represented as _",
    "nodes _ , directing messages to friends is represented by _ directed links _ , where the number of messages sent in the particular direction determines the _ weight _ @xmath5 of the directed links from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .    in ref .",
    "i we have analysed topology of the network for two different time depths , two and three months . here",
    "we shortly summarize some topology features which are relevant for this work . regarding the topology by omitting the weight of the link",
    ", we observe a different distribution for the out - degree , i.e. , the number of friends a user sends messages to , and the in - degree , i.e. , the number of friends a user receives messages from .",
    "the out - degree distribution follows a power law with a scaling exponent of 2.5 , that does not change much if the time window is extended from two to three months . on the other hand , the in - degree distribution changes , converging to a stretched exponential when",
    "the time window is increased . eventually , we found some disassortative mixing with respect to in - degree ( `` who is linked to my neighbors who are writing to me ? '' ) , which remains stable if the time window is increased @xcite .",
    "these networks are very sparse with the link density @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 and small reciprocity of links @xmath10 close to 0.021 and practically independent on the time depth .    here",
    "we use a part of the network termed ` net3321 ` extracted from the dataset of two - months time depth . the network is reduced and compacted ,",
    "the users that have sent and received less than 5 messages within two months have been excluded .",
    "hence the reduced network contains @xmath11 nodes organized in four user communities @xcite .",
    "its average link density @xmath12 and reciprocity @xmath13 . graphical view of ` net3321 ` is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - net3321 ] , where the widths of the directed links correspond to the number of messages retrieved from that dataset .",
    "cc      the ` myspace ` dataset further allows us to obtain other empirical features about the user activity , which are later used to calibrate the model . as it will be clear in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] , we use the delay times distribution @xmath15 and the time series of new user arrivals @xmath16 as the input for the model . in this section",
    "we extract and analyse these quantities from the empirical dataset .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata ] .    in @xcite",
    ", this distribution @xmath15 was determined from the two datasets .",
    "it is fitted with a power - law with a small exponent for the delay times longer than one day .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]a shows the interactivity - time distribution @xmath15 of users , where @xmath17 refers to the time between two consecutive actions ( delay ) of the same user , with the original time resolution of @xmath18 . in this paper",
    "we are just using the histogram of the interactivity - time as an input for our computer simulations as explained in sect .",
    "[ sec - model ]    cc +    the second important empirical value is the number of new users @xmath16 entering the network per time unit @xmath19 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]b ( red line ) with a time resolution of @xmath20 .",
    "the time series indicates large fluctuations , but also some periodicity . in the same figure",
    "we also show the total number of messages @xmath21 per time unit ( black line ) with the same time resolution , which reveals that @xmath22 , which is the driven signal , tightly follows @xmath16 , which is the driving signal . in conclusion ,",
    "communication in ` myspace ` seems to be driven to a large extent by new users entering the network for the first time ( with respect to the beginning of the time window ) .    to further verify this correlated behavior , we analysed the hurst exponent @xmath23 and the power spectrum @xmath24 of both @xmath16 and @xmath21 time series , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]c , d .",
    "the hurst exponent in the two time series measures the persistence of the community dynamics , i.e. how consistent the dynamics is ( i ) in attracting new users and ( ii ) in generating new messages , respectively .",
    "note that the time series in fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]b are stationary .",
    "the exponent @xmath23 is calculated as follows : for both time series @xmath25 with total length @xmath26 , the series is divided into @xmath27 boxes of equal time span .",
    "then the maximal range of the fluctuations @xmath28 of the cumulative time series @xmath29 is found and compared with its standard deviation @xmath30 on the same interval @xmath27 .",
    "plotting the rescaled fluctuations range @xmath31 against @xmath27 , the exponent is extracted from the power - law dependence as @xmath32 , for @xmath33 .",
    "the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]c show the rescaled fluctuations for the time series of new users and the number of messages with exponents @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath24 is the transformation of the time series @xmath16 , @xmath22 in the frequency space @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]d .",
    "one notice the remarkable peak in the spectrum which results from the daily pattern of users online regularly .",
    "further , we find that , in the regions of low frequencies @xmath36 , both spectra are characterized by a power - law decay @xmath37 , with similar exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . however , the power - law range is almost one order of magnitude smaller for the driving signal @xmath16 than for the driven signal @xmath22 .",
    "this suggests that the system builds correlated behavior on the shorter time scales .",
    "this is also seen in the differences between the persistence ranges for small @xmath27 in fig.[fig - fromdata]c .",
    "but we emphasize that @xmath16 can not be treated as a proxy of @xmath22 because of the difference . instead",
    ", there is a variable that links the two , which is related to the writing activity .",
    "as we will show later , this link is given by the emotions of the users expressed in terms of valence and arousal .",
    "in our model we will use the driving signal @xmath16 , i.e. the number of new users entering the social network , as an input variable .",
    "so far , we have described the topology of the social network and the activity patters of the users .",
    "this provides the basis for the most important question , namely how users interact and influence each other , which is the focus of our paper . for this",
    ", we have to analyse the messages exchanged between users , in particular their emotional content . specifically , we quantify emotions with respect to two dimensions , arousal and valence @xcite .",
    "the latter indicates the pleasure associated with the emotion ( positive , negative , neutral ) , the former the level activity that it induces .    in order to extract the emotional content from the messages , we use sentiment analysis by applying a standard procedure introduced in @xcite .",
    "it uses the anew dataset , a _ lexicon of human ratings of valence and arousal _ with about 1000 words @xcite , for which the emotional charge , or valence , @xmath40 and the arousal @xmath41 was determined . an algorithm then calculates the frequency @xmath42 of such classified words in a given text message , to compute the valence and arousal of the text sequence as @xmath43 for the first time , here we apply this method to the ` myspace ` dataset . due to the limited size of the anew lexicon",
    ", the method should be preferably used on long texts because of statistical reasons . to overcome this limitation",
    ", we extracted the stem , or root form , of all words in the analyzed text .",
    "the stem contains most of the semantic information of a word ( and thus its emotional content ) , and allows us to match similar words rather than exact matches , which eventually improves the statistics . to extract the stem , we used porter s stemming algorithm @xcite , a technique that applies inverse generalized rules of linguistic deflection , mapping deflected words to the same stem .",
    "for example , the stem of the words `` lovely '' and `` loving '' by that method is `` love '' , which matches the corresponding word in the anew lexicon .",
    "this way , the sentiment analysis covers a larger portion of the text and allows to calculate the emotional values for more than 60% of the messages in the dataset .",
    "the results of the analysis of emotional expression of the ` myspace ` dataset are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - circumplex ] . to be compatible with russell s circumplex model @xcite , we rescaled the output of eqs .",
    "( [ eq - anew ] ) to the range @xmath44 $ ] and adopted the standard polar diagram for the quantitative representation of emotions by using the following transformation : @xmath45 different points in this diagram are associated with different emotions . for comparison ,",
    "the markers @xmath46 indicate examples of emotions which are known in psychology @xcite .",
    "the distribution of valence values for the messages of our dataset is highly biased towards positive values , as the largest density in fig .",
    "[ fig - circumplex ] is above 0 .",
    "[ fig - valdist ] shows the distribution of valence for messages that contain at least one word from the anew dataset .",
    "we notice that the mode is at 0.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown @xcite that english written text is naturally biased towards positive emotions , with a mean @xmath47 and a standard deviation @xmath48 for the valence .",
    "this needs to be taken into account to interpret fig .",
    "[ fig - valdist ] , so we renormalise each valence value using @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the valence from eq .",
    "( [ eq - anew ] ) and @xmath51 is the amount of anew words in the message . the renormalized valence distribution is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig - valdist ] .",
    "we find that , despite this renormalization , there is still a large bias towards positive emotions in the messages of ` myspace ` .    on the other hand , the distribution of the expressed arousal ( vertical axis of fig .",
    "[ fig - circumplex ] ) is quite concentrated around values close to 0 , i.e. ` myspace ` messages rarely contain words expressing strong arousal .",
    "this finding is in line with previous survey studies @xcite in which arousal from written texts showed a small variance .",
    "our agent - based model of emotional influence between ` myspace ` users builds on the empirical findings about ( i ) their interaction network , ( ii ) their temporal activity patterns , ( iii ) the entry rate of new users , and ( iv ) the emotionality of their messages .",
    "however , we do not get from the data the way emotional messages influence the activity and the emotional state of other users . thus ,",
    "in our model we provide hypotheses about this feedback which are tested against the aggregated outcome .    in specifying the model , we follow the agent - based framework of emotional influence outlined in @xcite , which was already applied to product reviews @xcite , chat rooms @xcite , and blog discussion @xcite . in this framework , the emotional state of agent @xmath6 is described by two variables , valence @xmath52 $ ] , and arousal @xmath53 $ ] which each follow a stochastic dynamics . in previous work @xcite stochasticity",
    "was modeled simply by an additive stochastic force . in the present model we assume , similarly to the model of agents on blogs @xcite , that stochasticity may result from three sources : ( i ) sampling from the empirical inter - activity time distribution @xmath54 , fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]a , ( ii ) sampling from the empirical rate @xmath16 at which new users enter the network , fig .",
    "[ fig - fromdata]b , ( iii ) a spontaneous reset of both valence and arousal to a predefined value @xmath55 with a probability @xmath56 .",
    "the latter captures uncertainty in determining the external influences on an agent s state and is treated as a tunable parameter , as explained below .",
    "the value of this state resets can vary according to very different origins , including influential events for the users or emotional consequences of the design of ` myspace ` as a website .",
    "another source of stochasticity is on choosing the receipient of the message , as explained below .",
    "we further introduce an internal binary variable @xmath57 which describes if an agent is active ( @xmath58 ) or not ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath57 is set according to the sampling from the inter - activity time distribution @xmath15 .",
    "if the agent is not active , it only relaxes towards a neutral state @xmath60 with decay rates @xmath61 , @xmath62 . if it is active , however , the agent perceives messages displayed on its own or on friend s walls which affect its valence and arousal .",
    "we note that this definition of `` active '' is somewhat different from previous work where activity always implied writing a message . here , writing is considered a subsequent activity which only happens with a certain probability dependent on the agent s arousal and on the global activity level which is proxied by the entry rate @xmath16 as described below .",
    "to model how agents perceiving messages are affected by these , there are three levels of aggregated information in our model : ( i ) aggregation of messages on the agent s wall which shall be captured by an information field @xmath63 , ( ii ) aggregation of messages perceived on the friends walls , captured by an information field @xmath64 , ( iii ) aggregation of messages on all walls , i.e. a mean - field information @xmath65 that that captures a kind of `` atmosphere '' of the community .",
    "[ fig - modelschema ] provides a simplified overview of the different contributions to the information field and how they affect the emotional state of two agents @xmath6 and @xmath7 . because each of the messages is carrying a valence and arousal value ( according to eq .",
    "( [ eq - anew])in analogy to real data ) , the information field @xmath66 also has a valence and arousal component @xmath67 , @xmath68 which results from the respective aggregation . specifically , different from previous modeling assumptions @xcite",
    ", we assume here that the agent s valence is only affected by the valence information , while the arousal and activity ( e.g. in choosing conversation partners ) are primarily affected by the arousal information , but also include the contribution of the valence fields , as explained below .     and valence @xmath50 of the agent @xmath6 : ( 1 ) first neighborhood @xmath69",

    "the nonlinear functions @xmath78 capture how valence and arousal are affected by the information fields @xmath66 .",
    "an analytical discussion for these was provided in @xcite . here , we use the following assumtions : @xmath79 \\times [ c_1+c_2(v_{i}(t)-v^{3}_{i}(t))][1-\\vert v_i(t)\\vert ]    \\nonumber \\\\",

    "nonlinear assumptions are made in accordance with @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath80 $ ] is added to confine both variables in the prescribed range of the phase space .",
    "the small parameter @xmath81 $ ] adjusts the fraction of the influence of the mean - field information , @xmath82 , whereas the small parameter @xmath83 $ ] adjusts the influence of the information of the friends walls , @xmath84 , in relation to the own wall , @xmath85 .",
    "the latter makes a difference between the valence and the arousal dynamics .",
    "we assume that the arousal dynamics of an agent depends on the activity on the walls of its friends , captured by @xmath86 .",
    "we neglect this influence in the valence , because the level of pleasure should rather depend on the messages directed to @xmath6 and not to its neighbors .    in order to close the model",
    ", we now have to define the dynamics of the different components of the information fields . for our investigation of the social network",
    "we assume that the mean - field information can be neglected , i.e. @xmath87 , whereas for other applications such as blogs dynamics @xcite some mean - fields influence ( @xmath88 ) is needed , while in the product reviews @xcite or chat room conversation @xcite the mean - field plays the main role , i.e. @xmath89 . moreover , in the case of social networks , _ the main contribution of the information field comes from the agent s individual wall _ , thus we set @xmath90 .",
    "we define the sequence of all messages from agent @xmath7 to agent @xmath6 as @xmath71 .",
    "so the wall of an agent captured by @xmath85 contains the message sequences from all its friends . the influence of this information ,",
    "however , decays in time with a rate @xmath91 . for the valence and arousal component of @xmath66 , we assume the following dynamics ( where @xmath92 stands either for valence @xmath50 or arousal @xmath93 ) : @xmath94 @xmath85 is generated by steams of messages @xmath95 from the neighbor nodes , where for each messages @xmath96 creation time @xmath97 is traced and the heavyside function @xmath98 $ ] ensures that its influence does not start before .",
    "the emotional content of the message is composed by the values of valence or arousal @xmath99 of the neighboring agents @xmath7 at time @xmath97 .",
    "its influence further depends on the weight @xmath100 of the directed link which is determined empirically ( see sect . [ sec - empirical ] ) .",
    "the exponential decay terms result from our assumption of the decay of the information influence with rate @xmath91 , where @xmath101 is the time of the last message on the wall of agent @xmath6 .",
    "the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq - hiaw ] ) plays the role of a normalization to keep the field values properly bounded .",
    "in addition to the individual field component @xmath85 , the influence of the friends walls aggregated in @xmath84 has to be specified . as explained above",
    ", there is only the arousal related component @xmath86 for which we assume : @xmath102 firstly , @xmath86 is composed of the average over the weighted arousal fields on the friends walls at time @xmath19 .",
    "the weights @xmath5 , however , are modified by a term that takes into account the similarity between the valence @xmath40 of the agent @xmath6 and the valence of its friends walls captured by the valence field @xmath103 .",
    "this is due to the fact that agents can only see the message walls of their friends , but not directly observe their valence .",
    "information thus becomes the more important the more it is in line with the emotions of an agent .",
    "there is also a psychological argument for this assumption : users often search for information reinforcing their emotional state @xcite .",
    "further , there is a technical argument : to cope with information overload @xcite most social networking sites filter information such that content presented to the user is in line with its previous writing .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq - secondterm ] ) captures the influence of every `` friend - of - a - friend '' , because they are able to post messages on the walls of the friends of an agent , i.e. there is a second - nearest - neighbor influence that can not be perceived in the same way in off - line social interactions , but is very characteristic for online social interaction .",
    "our model captures this important feature of the online communication dynamics .    the last part of specifying the model regards the writing activity of the agent which is subsequent to perceiving messages .",
    "if an agent is in the state @xmath58 , it write a message with a probability @xmath104 that increases with its current arousal @xmath41 .",
    "the proportionality , as mentioned before , depends on the global activity level proxied by @xmath16 and a strength parameter @xmath105 , hence @xmath106 .",
    "the emotional content of the messages is given by the emotional state of the agent in terms of @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the time of writing .",
    "next , the recipient of the message has to be determined . instead of a uniform random choice , friend @xmath7 of an agent",
    "will be chosen with a probability @xmath107 that depends on ( i ) the aggregated information @xmath108 generated by @xmath7 on the wall of @xmath6 ( whereas @xmath100 represents the strength of the social link estimated by the total number of messages generated by @xmath7 on @xmath6 s wall ) , and ( ii ) the importance of the wall of friend @xmath7 to agent @xmath6 .",
    "the rational behind this assumption is the following : when a user writes a message to someone else , this can be part of an ongoing conversation or initiate a conversation .",

    "the influence of these states spreads through the networks by means of agent interactions through the field , giving raise to the asymmetrical v - shape pattern .",
    "cc +      the agent - based model also allows us to understand how cascades of emotional influence propagate through the real social network of ` myspace ` .",
    "precisely , will positive emotions propagate along the same social links as negative ones ? obviously , agents may exchange positive or negative messages with different preferred neighbors .",
    "to what neighbor the message will be sent depends on the agent s past interaction along the link , strength of the influence fields and the valence similarity with the wall of the recipient agent .",
    "the global problem of finding the pattern of most frequently used links on the entire network is appropriately captured by the _ maximum - flow spanning tree _ of that network . on these trees",
    "each node is attached to the rest of the tree by its strongest link .",
    "again , strength of a link between two agents is determined as the total amount of messages sent along that link during the simulation time .",

    "we first note that the pattern reflects the directedness of the links , i.e. agent @xmath6 may have its strongest link to agent @xmath7 ( in terms of messages exchanged ) , but not vice versa .",
    "this reveals the existence of strong hubs in the social network , i.e. agents to which many other agents have their strongest links .",
    "interestingly , in the case of the positive emotion with high arousal , `` enthusiastic '' , the large hubs occur along the central branch of the tree , and similarly , side branches contain smaller hubs of comparable size .",

    "the analyzed data have high temporal resolution and contain full texts of dialogs exchanged among users at the connected part of the network within two months period .",

    "the rules of actions are motivated by realistic situations in the online social networks and some of the parameters governing the dynamics are inferred from the same dataset of ` myspace ` dialogs .",
    "several other parameters , for instance decay time of emotion and network ' ' reactivity  , which can not be estimated from the available empirical data , have been kept within theoretically plausible limits .",
    "in addition , within the model we infer the _ action - delay _ and _ circadian _ cycles as generated by the real - world processes of ` myspace ` users , which condition the pace of their actions and stepping into the virtual world of the online social network , respectively . with this \" native  set of control parameters , the simulation results enable us to derive several conclusions , in particular regarding the emotion spreading processes in ` myspace ` , and potentials of the model for predicting user behaviors in hypothetical ( experimental ) situations .",
    "* _ temporal correlations of users activity in ` myspace ` _ occur on long - time scale and are accompanied by high arousal and predominantly positive emotions . * _ rhythms of users stepping from real - to - virtual world _ carry certain important features of the communication processes in the online social networks .",
    "specifically , the temporal correlations in the online dynamics are built as a response to already correlated step - in processes . otherwise , if not driven in a different way , the online social networks with their internal dynamics of the user - to - user contacts and restricted visibility of messages are not capable to generate correlations on large temporal scale . *",
    "patterns of emotion dynamics in the virtual world of social networks are different for positive and for negative emotions . in the empirical data of myspace the positive - valence emotions dominate .",
    "however , model simulations of spreading emotional states with different arousal  valence components and different social connotations , `` enthusiastic '' and `` ashamed '' , for example , show different patterns in the phase space of the emotions involved as well as the social links used to spread the emotions on the network .",
    "* _ high - arousal states _ in the dynamics are built on small noisy input for all initial emotion states in our simulations , which is reminiscent of `` party''-like behavior of the agents . in our model",
    "this is a consequence of collective effects  repeated actions of an agent caught in the active network environment",
    ".    quantitative analysis of the simulated and the empirical data lead to similar results , for instance , comparison of the correlations of the emotional time series in cf . figs .",
    "[ fig - fromdata ] and [ fig - myspaceabmtimeseries ] , and range of the expressed valences , in fig .",

    "this suggests that the model of emotional agents can reproduce the stylized facts of the empirical data of ` myspace ` dialogs , when the parameters are appropriately chosen ! moreover , within the model , genesis of the emergent behaviors with particular contributions of each user ( agent ) and its social connections  can be revealed !",
    "this makes the predictive value of the model .",
    "it is more subtle , however , to relate the predictions of the model which regard the individual agent s emotional state and its fluctuations with the `` feelings change '' observed in the psychology research of the online communications . in this respect",
    "one can recognize that a characteristic area in the positive - valence high - arousal states recurrently being visited by the agents , may reflect the positive baselines of human valence and arousal found in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the emergent asymmetrical v - shape patterns of figs . [ fig - myspaceabmcircumplex ] correspond with the patterns of natural selective attention discovered in psycho - physiological studies @xcite . for evolutionary reasons ,",
    "humans have two modes of reaction to emotional content : appetitive and defensive motivation .",
    "both tendencies can be seen in our simulations , opening the question of which one of them is predominant in the users internal emotions . this way our agent based model provides testable hypotheses for psychological research , as the dynamics of the emotional reaction of users of online communities might depend on the emotional state of new members .",
    "experimental setups similar to the ones presented in @xcite can test whether the physiological reactions to new community members ( arrivals ) follow the patterns predicted by our model .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presented agent - based simulations give a new insight into emotion dynamics in online social networks . in the model , the interaction rules , closely related to ` myspace ` social network site , take into account influence of the next - neighborhood on the agent s statea salient feature of the online social networks , and the extended phase space where common emotions can be recognized . hence , despite of its mathematical complexity , our model provides a `` laboratory '' for further experiments on the emotional agent s behavior ( e.g. , under different driving conditions , varied external inputs , and changed values of the parameters ) and for a comparative analysis of online and offline social networks .",
