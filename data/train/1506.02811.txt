    "one of the principal problems in probability and statistics is the understanding of maximal deviations of averages from their means .",
    "the revolutionary work of vapnik and chervonenkis @xcite introduced a completely new combinatorial approach that opened many paths and helped us understand this fundamental phenomena .",
    "today , the vapnik - chervonenkis theory has become the theoretical basis of statistical machine learning , empirical process theory , and has applications in a diverse array of fields .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to initiate the exploration of maximal deviations of complex random structures from their typical behavior .",
    "we introduce a model for a high - dimensional random graph process and ask analogous questions to those of vapnik and chervonenkis for deviations of averages : how `` rich '' does the process have to be so that one sees atypical behavior . in particular , we study a process of erds - rnyi random graphs . in the @xmath2 model introduced by erds - rnyi @xcite ,",
    "a graph on @xmath3 vertices is obtained by connecting each pair of vertices with probability @xmath4 , independently , at random .",
    "the @xmath2 model has been thoroughly studied and many of its properties are well understood ",
    "see , e.g. , the monographs of bollobs @xcite and janson , uczak , and ruciski @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a random graph process indexed by unit vectors in @xmath0 , defined as follows .",
    "for positive integer @xmath3 , write @xmath5=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] .",
    "for @xmath6 , let @xmath7 be independent standard normal vectors in @xmath0 .",
    "denote by @xmath8 the collection of these random points . for each @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 denotes the unit sphere in @xmath0 ) and",
    "@xmath11 we define the random graph @xmath12 with vertex set @xmath13 $ ] and edge set @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the usual inner product in @xmath0 .    for any fixed @xmath9 and @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 is distributed as an erds - rnyi random graph @xmath2 , with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the distribution function of a standard normal random variable . in particular , @xmath18 is a @xmath19 random graph . with a slight abuse of notation ,",
    "we write @xmath20 for @xmath18 .",
    "we study the _ random graph process _",
    "@xmath22 is a stationary process of @xmath2 random graphs , indexed by @xmath1-dimensional unit vectors . for larger values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the process becomes `` richer '' .",
    "our aim is to explore how large the dimension @xmath1 needs to be for there to exist random directions @xmath23 for which @xmath24 has different behavior from what is expected from a @xmath2 random graph . adapting terminology from dynamical percolation @xcite , we call such directions _ exceptional rotations_. more precisely , in analogy with the vapnik - chervonenkis theory of studying atypical deviations of averages from their means , our aim is to develop a _ vc theory _ of random graphs",
    ". in particular , we study three fundamental properties of the graphs in the family @xmath22 : the size of the largest clique , the chromatic number , and connectivity . in the first two cases we consider @xmath25 while in the study of connectivity we focus on the case when @xmath26 for some constant @xmath27 .",
    "the graph properties we consider are all monotone , so have a critical probability @xmath28 at which they are typically obtained by @xmath2 .",
    "for example , consider connectivity , and suppose we first place ourselves above the critical probability in @xmath2 , e.g. , @xmath29 for @xmath30 , so that @xmath2 is with high probability connected . then the question is how large should @xmath1 be to ensure that for some member graph in the class , the property ( connectivity ) disappears .",
    "there is a threshold _ dimension _",
    "@xmath1 for this , and we develop upper and lower bounds for that dimension . secondly , consider the regime below the critical probability for connectivity in @xmath2 , e.g. , @xmath29 for @xmath31 . in this case , with high probability @xmath2 is not connected , and we ask how large @xmath1 should be to ensure that for some member graph in the class , the property ( connectivity ) appears .",
    "again , we develop upper and lower bounds for the threshold dimension @xmath1 for this .    in all , for each of the three properties considered in this paper , clique number , chromatic number , and connectivity , four theorems are needed , to describe upper and lower bounds for the threshold dimension for exceptional behaviour in the subcritical regime ( when the property typically does not obtain ) and in the supercritical regime ( when the property typically does obtain ) . in every case , our results reveal a remarkable asymmetry between `` upper '' and `` lower '' deviations relative to this threshold .",
    "our techniques combine some of the essential notions introduced by vapnik and chervonenkis ( such as shattering , covering , packing , and symmetrization ) , with elements of high - dimensional random geometry , coupled with sharp estimates for certain random graph parameters .    the model considered in this paper uses subsets of the collection of halfspaces in @xmath0 to define the random graphs in the collection",
    ". a natural variant would be one in which we associate with each edge @xmath32 a uniformly distributed random vector on the torus @xmath33^d$ ] , and consider a class parametrized by @xmath34^d$ ] .",
    "then define the edge set @xmath35 . for general classes of sets of @xmath0 ,",
    "the complexity of the classes will affect the behaviour of the collection of random graphs in a universal manner .",
    "we can define the complexity of a class of graphs indexed in terms of the threshold dimension needed to make certain graph properties appear or disappear in the subcritical and supercritical regimes , respectively .",
    "it will be interesting to explore the relationship between the combinatorial geometry of the class and these complexities .",
    "note that when @xmath36 , @xmath37 only contains two graphs ( when @xmath25 , one is the complement of the other ) , and therefore the class is trivial . on the other extreme ,",
    "when @xmath38 , with probability one , the collection @xmath39 contains _ all _ @xmath40 graphs on @xmath3 vertices .",
    "this follows from the following classical result on the `` vc shatter coefficient '' of linear half spaces ( see , e.g. , schlffli @xcite , cover @xcite ) that determines the number of different graphs in @xmath39 ( with probability one ) .",
    "[ lem : schlaffli ] given @xmath41 points @xmath42 in general position ( i.e. , every subset of @xmath1 points is linearly independent ) , the number of binary vectors @xmath43 of the form @xmath44 for some @xmath9 equals @xmath45    in particular , when @xmath46 , all @xmath47 possible dichotomies of the @xmath48 points are realizable by some linear half space with the origin on its boundary .",
    "in such a case we say that the @xmath48 points are _ shattered _ by half spaces .",
    "* notation and overview . * throughout the paper , @xmath49 denotes natural logarithm . for a sequence @xmath50 of events",
    ", we say that @xmath51 holds _ with high probability _ if @xmath52 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : clique ] we study the clique number in the case @xmath25 .",
    "the four parts of theorem [ thm : clique ] establish upper and lower bounds for the critical dimension above which , with high probability , there exist graphs in @xmath39 whose largest clique is significantly larger / smaller than the typical value , which is @xmath53 .",
    "we show that the critical dimension for which some graphs in @xmath39 have a clique number at least , say , @xmath54 is of the order of @xmath55 .    in sharp contrast to this , @xmath1 needs to be at least @xmath56 to find a graph in @xmath39 with maximum clique size @xmath57 less than the typical value .",
    "we study this functional in section [ sec : chromatic ]",
    ". theorem [ thm : chromatic ] summarizes the four statements corresponding to upper and lower bounds in the sub- , and super - critical regime . once again , the two regimes exhibit an important asymmetry . while no graphs in @xmath39 have a chromatic number a constant factor larger than typical unless @xmath1 is is of the order of @xmath58 , there exist graphs with a constant factor smaller chromatic number for @xmath1 near @xmath3 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : connectivity ] , connectivity properties are examined . to this end , we place ourselves in the regime @xmath59 for some constant @xmath60 . when @xmath61 , a typical graph @xmath2 is disconnected , with high probability , while for @xmath62 it is connected . in theorem",
    "[ thm : connectivity ] we address both cases .",
    "we show that for @xmath62 , the critical dimension above which one finds disconnected graphs among @xmath63 is of the order of @xmath64 .",
    "( our upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of @xmath65 . )",
    "we also show that when @xmath61 , @xmath1 needs to be at least roughly @xmath66 in order to find a connected graph @xmath63 .",
    "while we conjecture this lower bound to be sharp , we do not have a matching upper bound in this case .",
    "however , we are able to show that when @xmath1 is at least of the order of @xmath67 , @xmath63 not only contains some connected graphs but with high probability , for any spanning tree , there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath12 contains that spanning tree .",
    "this property holds for even much smaller values of @xmath4 .    in the appendix",
    "we gather some technical estimates required for the proofs .",
    "in this section we consider @xmath25 and investigate the extremes of the clique number amongst the graphs @xmath20 , @xmath9 .",
    "denote by @xmath68 the size of the largest clique in @xmath20 .",
    "the typical behavior of the clique number of a @xmath19 random graph is quite accurately described by matula s classical theorem @xcite that states that for any fixed @xmath9 , for any @xmath69 , @xmath70 with probability tending to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "here we are interested in understanding the values of @xmath1 for which graphs with atypical clique number appear .",

    "in fact , with a more careful argument we show below that when @xmath1 is a sufficiently large constant multiple of @xmath80 , then , with high probability , there exists @xmath9 such that @xmath79 .",
    "we also show that no such @xmath23 exists for @xmath81 . perhaps more surprisingly , clique numbers significantly smaller than the typical value only appear for huge values of @xmath1 .",
