    "considerable effort has been spent recently in the investigation of the heat capacity @xmath1 of semiconductors and insulators in the region below the debye temperature @xmath2 , in particular around 0.1 @xmath2 , where strong deviations from debye s @xmath3 power law take place .",
    "the availability of stable isotopes has also enabled the investigation of the dependence of @xmath1 on one isotopic mass ( in monatomic crystals such as c ( ref . ) , si ( ref . ) , ge ( ref . ) , sb ( ref . ) , bi ( ref . ) ) or on the isotopic mass of each constituent in polyatomic compounds , such as gan ( ref . ) or zn0 ( ref . ) , whereas the development of efficient computer codes for electronic band structure calculations has made possible _ ab initio _ calculations of the phonon dispersion relations and the temperature dependence of the specific heat .    although experimental and calculated results for @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ( ref . )",
    "agree usually reasonable well , it has been recently discovered that considerable discrepancies exist when heavy constituent atoms are present , e.g. bi ( ref . ) , pb in pbs ( ref . ) , if the hamiltonian used for the calculation of the electronic structure does not include spin - orbit ( s - o ) interaction . by performing _",
    "ab initio _ calculations in which the s - o interaction is switched on and off , it has been rather conclusively shown that this interaction `` softens '' the phonon frequencies ( ref . ) and thus increases the low - temperature maximum found in @xmath7 versus @xmath8.@xcite    in this article we present _ ab initio _ calculations of the phonon dispersion relations of pbs , pbse and pbte based on the electronic band structure obtained with the abinit code.@xcite this program enables the inclusion of s - o interaction , separately or jointly for the cation or anion constituents , thus making it possible to separate the s - o contributions to the dispersion relation and the heat capacity .",
    "the abinit program determines the dynamical matrix elements by perturbation theory .",
    "once these elements are known , it is a simple task to calculate the dispersion relations for a given set of isotopic masses and thus to determine isotopic effects on the dispersion relations and the specific heat . because of the importance of s - o interaction , we have performed the isotope effect calculations only with",
    "s - o interaction included . within the range of stable isotopes available in nature ( and accessible to our budget )",
    "only mass changes of a few percent are possible : the resulting variations in the physical properties are thus linear in the mass changes .",
    "results for pbs have already been published in ref .. at that time , the abinit code did not properly include s - o interaction for diatomic polar compounds .",
    "we therefore present here similar results including s - o interaction : the inclusion of this interaction reduces the discrepancy between calculated and experimental values of @xmath9 ( 29% ) by a factor of 2 .",
    "a similar reduction is found for pbse , whereas for pbte the calculated values almost exactly agree with the measured data . in this latter case",
    "the effect of the s - o interaction on the maximum of @xmath7 is 18% ( we recall that the s - o interaction softens the phonons and correspondingly increases @xmath7 at the maximum ) .",
    "globally , the inclusion of s - o interaction also improves the agreement between the calculated and the measured ( by inelastic neutron scattering , ins ) phonon dispersion relation , except for the lo phonons in the vicinity of the @xmath10-point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) . at this point ,",
    "the long range electric fields associated with the lo phonons lead to some convergence problems which we have not been able to avoid completely .    in ref . , and in ref",
    "we also reported densities of one- and two - phonon ( with the same @xmath11-value both , as required to compare with optical spectroscopy results ) states , calculated for pbs in the absence of s - o interaction .",
    "we present here similar two - phonon spectra obtained for the three lead chalcogenides including s - o interaction .",
    "the features obtained in the density of one - phonon states , and their projections on the constituent atoms , are useful ( and very instructive ) for the interpretation of the isotope effects .",
    "we have also looked at the effect of s - o interaction on the lattice parameter @xmath12 as obtained by energy minimization .",
    "this effect is rather small ( @xmath13 0.2% ) .",
    "it does not help to reduce the discrepancy between the calculated and the measured values , which is about 2% .",
    "the calculations of the dispersion relations and the specific heat were performed with the dynamical matrix obtained from the lda electronic structure calculations using the abinit code.@xcite hartwigsen - goedecker - hutter relativistic separable dual - space pseudopotentials were used.@xcite we performed checks with lda and gga functionals and convinced ourselves that no significant differences resulted ; we therefore used lda functionals throughout .",
    "for the pb pseudopotential we also checked that our conclusions did not depend on the inclusion of 5@xmath14 electrons in the valence bands .",
    "this allows us to use the pseudopotential as it is given in the abinit website .",
    "the implementation of the s - o term has been discussed in ref . .",
    "we investigated cell parameter convergence as a function of energy cutoff and @xmath11-grid mesh . with the cutoff at 60 hartree",
    "the total energy is converged up to 0.5 mev and stresses are lower than 0.006 gpa .",
    "the bz is sampled using a 6 @xmath15 6 @xmath15 6 monkhorst - pack grid.@xcite technical details of the calculations of the phonon dispersion relations can be found in ref . and .",
    "prior to obtaining the dynamical matrix the lattice parameter @xmath12 was optimized through minimization of the total energy . in the calculations we used this parameter and",
    "not the experimental one .    after obtaining the dispersion relations ,",
    "the phonon free energy @xmath16 was calculated with the integral given in eq .",
    "( 2 ) of ref . .",
    "the specific heat was obtained with the expression :    @xmath17    after calculating the dynamical matrix elements we diagonalized the hamiltonian for two different sets of masses ( either cation or anion ) differing by about 5% .",
    "the resulting dispersion relations were then used to calculate the derivatives of @xmath4 with respect to either mass .",
    "the logarithmic derivatives were also calculated because they can be related to the corresponding derivative with respect to temperature .",
    "the appropriate relation is given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) of ref . for the case of a monatomic crystal . for diatomic crystals",
    "such relation is not as simple since both , derivatives of @xmath4 versus the masses of cation and anion must be added in order to obtain the temperature derivative :    @xmath18    where x = s , se or te , respectively .    when calculating numerically the derivatives above at very low temperatures ( @xmath19 5k )",
    "one encounters a convergence problem because of the small values of @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "fortunately , the limit @xmath20 can be obtained analytically by using the debye-@xmath3 approximation .",
    "the corresponding expressions are found in eq .",

    "samples of pbx ( x = s , se , te ) were prepared by first reacting the corresponding pure elements and then subliming the product in an argon atmosphere .    in order to purify the lead isotope oxide layers on the metal pieces",

    "subsequently , the pieces were melted in silica ampoules in hydrogen or argon .",
    "remaining oxide stuck to the ampoule wall after rocking and rolling the droplets at temperatures from 400 to 650@xmath21c .",
    "the chalcogens were purified by sublimation and separation of the ampoule portion containing the residues . in the case of @xmath22te , we first reduced @xmath22teo with sulfur.@xcite the synthesis was performed in argon by increasing the temperature to @xmath13650 @xmath21c of the chalcogen . in",
    "the sealed silica ampoule crystal growth took place by sublimation at temperatures of 750 to 850 @xmath21c under excess of the corresponding chalcogen .",
    "this resulted in a cabbage - like growth of the compound on the lead .",

    "again we observe a lowering of nearly all frequencies induced by taking into account s - o interaction , which also brings the calculations , in most cases , closer to the experimental data .",
    "the measured to frequencies are known to be strongly renormalized downwards by the anharmonic interaction , even at low temperatures . by linearly extrapolating to @xmath8=0 the measured dependence of the to frequency on temperature ( from ref . )",
    "we obtain an unrenormalized ( harmonic ) to frequency of @xmath1313 @xmath24 , rather close to that calculated with s - o interaction ( @xmath13 14 @xmath24 , cf .",

    "this low to frequency for @xmath25 0k underscores the nearly ferroelectric nature of this material which would nominally become ferroelectric at @xmath13 - 70k.@xcite    a disturbing feature of fig [ fig3 ] is the dip in the lo - phonon band around the @xmath10- point when s - o coupling is taken into account .",
    "we have been able to show that the appearance of this dip is related to the closing and sign reversal of the electronic gap induced by the s - o splitting of the valence and conduction band edges .",

    "note that for pbse ( fig.2 ) a similar but smaller dip occurs when the s - o interaction is switched on . in this case",
    ", the band gap nearly vanishes for @xmath27 = 0 and becomes 0.52 ev for @xmath27 = 1 , with the same inverted order as in pbte .",
    "reversal of the gap is smaller than for pbte because the s - o splitting of se is smaller than that of te . for pbs ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) no dip is present other than that already existed without s - o splitting . the gap is @xmath13 0 for @xmath27 = 0 and 0.47 ev ( also inverted ) for @xmath27 = 1 .    in view of the systematics of the effects",
    "just described we conjecture that the anomalous dip in the lo frequencies observed at the @xmath10-point , is due to electron - phonon interaction of the type named after kristoffel and konsin.@xcite this interaction lowers the phonon frequencies at @xmath10 and can even lead to ferroelectricity when a phonon frequency vanishes ( this is almost but not quite the case for pbte but happens for snte , for which the gap is reversed with respect to pbte.@xcite since the measured lo frequency does not support the presence of the dip calculated for pbte ( and also less strongly for pbse ) we conclude that the dip is due to some as yet unidentified effect of the s - o interaction , probably related to the gap anomalies just described ( and to the so - called gap problem ubiquitous in lda calculations ) .",
    "we have just made a guess as to how the lo band should look like once the problem is removed , and represented it by a dotted red line , for both pbte and pbse ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "because of the small volume of @xmath11-space encompassed by the dip ( @xmath13 0.1% of the bz ) we believe that this problem should not affect our calculations of heat capacities .",
    "the densities ( dos ) of one - phonon states for the three materials under consideration are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , normalized to 6 states , as corresponds to one primitive cell ( pc ) .",
    "this figure shows not only the total dos but also its projection onto each of the two constituent atoms .",
    "a dos calculated using the dispersion relations without s - o interaction has already been reported for pbs in ref . .",

    "also , whereas without s - o interaction the vibrations of the two constituents are almost fully separated in frequency ( dividing line 112 @xmath24 ) , this is not the case any more if s - o coupling is included . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for pbs both types of vibrations ( pb - like and s - like ) overlap in the region between 100 and 130 @xmath24 , presumably related to the shrinking of the phonon band width . in the case of pbse three bands",

    "the low frequency one , with a strong peak at @xmath13 50 @xmath24 , corresponds to pb - like vibrations of ta phonons , whereas the high frequency one , centered at about 125 @xmath24 , is lo- and to- like and encompasses almost exclusively ( 95% ) se vibrations .",
    "the third band , centered around 80 @xmath24 , is a mixture of la- and to- like modes and encompasses vibrations of both constituent atoms with nearly the same amplitude .",
