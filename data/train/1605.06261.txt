    "the magnetic and optical tuning of frs are called magnetic feshbach resonance ( mfr ) @xcite and optical feshbach resonance ( ofr ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "mfrs are widely used in experiments of the dilute quantum gases with alkali atoms @xcite . even though the utility of ofrs with alkali atoms is limited",
    "compared with that of mfrs , ofrs also experimentally tune the interatomic interaction strengths with various atomic species @xcite . to date , ofrs have been used for generation of bound molecules in the excited state , the study of asymptotic physics , and the control of forbidden molecular states @xcite .",

    "furthermore , ofrs can be manipulated in a much faster time scale than mfrs controlled by magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "finally , scattering lengths can be spatially modulated with high spatial frequency within a small atomic cloud @xcite .",
    "+ ytterbium ( yb ) and strontium ( sr ) atoms are special candidates for ofrs because they have the intercombination transitions whose linewidths are sub - mhz , substantially narrower than those of alkali atoms .",
    "it has been suggested that ofrs with narrow - linewidth transitions can increase scattering lengths with relatively low atom loss @xcite .",
    "hence , bound molecules in the excited state have been generated with yb and sr atoms , which have optically accessible narrow - linewidth transitions @xcite .",
    "recently , atom - molecule conversion using an ultra narrow transition @xmath1 of @xmath2 atoms was also reported @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the manipulations of the interatomic interaction have been conducted @xcite .",
    "the ofrs of @xmath3 atoms with the intercombination transition has been well characterized with photoassociation ( pa ) spectroscopy of thermal gas experimentally and theoretically @xcite . while the interatomic potential in the excited state and its molecular bound states of @xmath4 are well studied to date @xcite , quantitative measurements depending on pa intensities and frequencies regarding the ofrs of @xmath0yb atoms are still required , including comparisons with theoretical calculations .",

    "the high atom number density of a bec provides orders of magnitude advantages in terms of the pa measurement signal - to - noise ratio compared to that of thermal atoms @xcite .",
    "also , the low temperatures of a bec suppress the thermal broadening effect preventing asymmetric redshifts in the pa spectrum @xcite . as a result , by using a bec as a platform to study ofrs , we are able to clearly observe its dependance on the pa beam intensity and frequency .",
    "in addition to spectral measurements , we obtain temporal decay of a pure bec with pa processes to confirm our measurements .",

    "the ytterbium atoms exiting the zeeman slower are captured with the core - shell mot scheme @xcite .",
    "the atoms trapped in the mot are compressed and loaded into a 532  nm crossed optical dipole trap ( odt ) that consists of two odt arms , main and auxiliary .",

    "after 18  ms of free expansion , measurements were taken via absorption imaging using a 398.9  nm laser resonant with the ground to singlet state ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the atom loss in the trap due to background gas ( lifetime @xmath18 ) was negligible for the time scales of our experiments , @xmath19 .",
