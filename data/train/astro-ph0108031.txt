    "recent observations in both x rays and tev gamma rays dramatically revealed the existence of non - thermal particles in the supernova remnants ( snr ) , which are accelerated up to @xmath2 100 tev presumably by the shock acceleration process .",
    "first set of such observations is the intense non - thermal x - ray emission from the rims of type ia snr sn1006 ( g327.6 + 14.6 ) by asca ( koyama et al .",
    "1995 ) and rosat ( willingale et al . 1996 ) , and the subsequent detection of tev gamma - ray emission from the norh east ( ne ) rim by cangaroo ( tanimori et al .",
    "the detected integral fluxes above tev were consistent with predictions based on the inverse compton scattering ( ic ) of high energy electrons with low energy photons of 2.7 k cosmic background ( mastichiadis and de jager 1996 ; yoshida and yanagita 1997 ) . following this success ,",
    "other two snrs have been detected in the same two energy bands ; strong synchrotron x - ray emission and tev gamma rays from rxj1713.7@xmath33946 ( g347.3@xmath30.5 ) were detected by asca in 1997 ( koyama et al . , 1997 ) and by cangaroo in 2001 ( muraishi et al . , 2001 ) respectively , and also",
    "those from cassiopeia a were detected by beppo sax ( allen et al . ,",
    "1997 ) and hegra ( phlhofer et al . , 1999 ) .    at present , snrs are generally favored as the site for the generation of galactic cosmic rays ( mainly protons ) .",
    "high energy gamma rays detected from snrs could be considered to emanate from @xmath4 decays induced by collisions between swept - up matter and accelerated protons in snrs . on the other hand ,",
    "gamma - rays detected from sn1006 are likely to be explained by ic radiation by very high energy electrons ( tanimori et al .",
    "1998 ) , because the matter density around the shock front in sn 1006 is too tenuous ( @xmath20.4 @xmath5 : willingale et al . 1996 ) to generate the observed tev gamma - ray flux from @xmath4s decays .",
    "the model based on the synchrotron - ic process can fit all the data of radio , x - ray and tev gamma rays .",
    "this model , in addition , predicts a flatter power law spectrum ( @xmath6 ) with an index of @xmath7 below the tev band with a turnover to a steeper spectra around the tev region . in this scheme , this steepening can be explained by a high energy limit of parent electrons , as an energy flux peak of the synchrotron emission appears in the soft x - ray region .    at present there",
    "still remains the possibility that an additional component of gamma rays from @xmath4 decays with the index of @xmath8 would gradually dominate instead of ic radiation in the sub - tev energy region .",
    "detailed study of the spectral shape is quite important to answer this question .    in april 2000 ,",
    "the new 10 m cangaroo - ii telescope was completed ( tanimori , et al . , 2001 and kawachi et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "both rxj1713.7@xmath33946 and sn1006 have been detected again with high statistics by this new telescope , and their results are presented in this conference ( enomoto et al , 2001 ; hara et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "thus we have firmly established the tev gamma - ray emission from snrs .    here",
    "we report on a further analysis of the same data set used in the previous paper ( tanimori et al . ,",
    "1998 ) in order to extract spectral information for the reasons mentioned above .",
    "observations were done with the 3.8 m erenkov imaging telescope of the cangaroo collaboration ( patterson & kifune 1992 ; hara et al .",
    "1993 ) near woomera , south australia ( 136@xmath947 e and 31@xmath906 s ) in 1996 and 1997 .    an imaging analysis using the conventional parameterization was applied for the data , where the parameter cuts were varied as a function of the energy of the shower .",
    "these variations of parameter cuts were estimated from the simulation study . here",
    "we add the additional analysis to enhance the gamma - ray signals using the fine timing information of each hit photomultiplier ( about 1 ns time resolution ) .",
    "an image obtained from a single telescope gives only one angle : the projection of the direction on a plane normal to the mirror axis .",
    "stereo observations are required to obtain the two angles necessary to determine the direction of a gamma - ray in the sky . for a single telescope ,",
    "the unknown angle of the shower direction lies on the extended long axis of the elliptic image .",
    "however if we know both the the arrival times and the height of the emitting point of erenkov light , the shower direction can be reconstructed .",
    "in other words , the arrival timings of erenkov photons emitted from a shower can be calculated if both the height and the direction of a shower are known .",
    "therefore , by assuming the height of shower generation ( @xmath10 is used here ) , the unknown angle can be calculated using the observed arrival timings of erenkov photons .",
    "the simulation indicated that the obtained angle is quite insensitive to the assumption of the shower height .",
    "we actually obtained this angle event by event , and used it only to estimate the direction of the shower development along the long axis of the image . by selecting the shower images for events from the target direction ,",
    "gamma - ray events should be enhanced , and indeed @xmath11 peaks in both the 1996 and 1997 data became more significant .",
    "the result of the 1997 data is presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:1]a and b and the significance of the @xmath11 peaks  was increased from 7.5 @xmath12 to 8.8 @xmath12 by this method .",
    "after this cut , about 70% of background events that survived through imaging selections can be further removed , while about 75% of the gamma - ray events remained .     for the 1997 data .",
    "( b ) is the similar plot after applying the timing selection , and ( c ) is also the similar plot for rejected events of ( a ) by this cut .",
    ", width=351 ]    in order to obtain the differential energy spectrum , several @xmath11 plots were made by varying the minimum and maximum numbers of detected erenkov photons .",
    "the collecting area , trigger efficiency and threshold energy corresponding to each @xmath11 plot were independently estimated from simulations , where events were generated between 1 tev and 30 tev using an initial power - law index of @xmath13 .",
    "this initial index was estimated from two observed integral fluxes 1996 ( threshold energy @xmath14 3.5 tev ) and 1997 ( threshold energy @xmath14 1.7 tev ) . at first",
    "the spectrum was calculated using this index .",
    "using the new index obtained from this spectrum , the above simulations and calculations were iterated in a similar way until the spectral index converged .",
    "other initial values of the index were tried , but the resultant index converged to the similar value .    the resultant differential spectrum , _",
    "j(e ) _ , between 1.5 tev and 20 tev is plotted in fig.[fig:2 ] in which only statistical errors are shown .",
    "it can be written as :    @xmath15    where errors quoted are statistical .",
    "systematic errors are estimated to be @xmath230% .",
    "differential fluxes of 1996 and 1997 data were also individually calculated , and those fluxes were consistent within one sigma errors .",
    "furthermore the differential flux without applying the timing reconstruction method was obtained to be quite similar to this flux .",
    "the resultant differential spectrum shows a spectral index of @xmath32.3 between 1.5 tev and 20 tev .",
    "the profile of the observed differential spectrum may resolve which ic or @xmath4 decay mechanism dominates this tev emission .",
    "the model used here originated in yoshida and yanagita ( 1997 ) , similar to the previous paper , while we improved the treatment of the approximation for the synchrotron flux ( naito et al . , 1999 ) : a simple @xmath16 function centered on the characteristic frequency was changed to the full function describing synchrotron emission ( rybicki and lightman 1979 and references therein ) .",
    "the electron spectrum was assumed to be as      in addition , the latest data of both radio ( reynolds and ellison 1992 ) and x - rays from rosat and asca ( willingale et al .",
    "1996 ; ozaki 1998 ) were used in fitting the synchrotron flux . in particular",
    ", we used the partial fluxes emitted from the ne rim for all data : for the asca data the partial flux has been directly obtained by ozaki ( 1998 ) , and for the radio and the rosat data the partial fluxes were estimated using the morphological distributions of radio ( winkler and long 1997 ) and rosat ( willingale et al .",
    "1996 ) data . comparing the calculated synchrotron flux to the observational data , we obtain @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in fig.[fig:2 ] several expected ic spectra are plotted by varying the strength of the ambient magnetic field , where @xmath20 is most probable , and this model matches successfully in the convex shape .",
    "the resultant field strength means the @xmath21 tev from the above formula .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the wide band energy spectrum from the radio to tev regions at the north rim of sn1006 and also the above fitting ( naito et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "all data are fitted very well all over the wide band . here",
    "an allowable spectrum due to @xmath22 decays generated by high energy proton is also plotted taking into account the upper limit of gev gamma - ray fluxes , which obviously conflicts with the observed tev gamma - ray flux .",
    "those upper limits in the gev region of this figure were calculated from the egret archive data using a maximum likelihood method ( mattox et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "these results seems very reasonable consequence considering the tenuous shell of ( @xmath230.4 @xmath5 ; willingale et al .",
    "1996 ) .    thus the identification of the parent particles of the tev gamma - rays ( electron or proton ) will be possible by observing the wide spectrum from sub- to multi - tev region as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "a gamma - ray spectrum flatter than @xmath32.0 in this region is surely due to the i.c .",
    "process , while that due to @xmath4 decay generated by collision between ism and high energy proton is expected to be steeper than @xmath32.0 .    from this fitting ,",
    "the energy flux of tev gamma rays due to the ic process at 300 gev is estimated to be @xmath2 4 ev @xmath24s@xmath25 , which is lower than the upper limit ( 8 ev @xmath24s@xmath25 at 300gev ) reported in chadwick et al .",
    "also we have observed again tev gamma rays from the ne rim of sn1006 observed by the 10 m telescope as presented in this conference ( hara et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "although the new data is still very preliminary , the spectra are consistent in the overlapping energy region .        in this conference , we present the interesting spectrum of tev gamma rays of psr1706@xmath344 showing an obvious break of the spectrum around 1 tev ( kushida et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "this breaking can be fit by the ic model quite well similar to the case of sn1006 .",
    "these two results indicate the major role of ic process for the production of high energy gamma rays in the universe .",
    "however , our result showing the ic process dominance for the production of tev gamma rays in sn1006 does not imply the nonexistence of the plenty of high energy protons accelerated by a diffusive shock . conventional diffusive shock theories naturally predict efficient acceleration of protons in snrs . in sn1006 , a deficiency of target protons surrounding the snr may conceal accelerated protons from being revealed .",
    "rxj1713.7@xmath33946 is the second snr emitting both synchrotron x - rays and tev gamma rays .",
    "however , the environment of rxj1713.7@xmath33946 is obviously different from sn1006 ; for example , association of rxj1713.7@xmath33946 with a molecular cloud is reported from the co observation ( slane et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "our new result on rxj1713.7@xmath33946 indicates a more intense flux below 1 tev , while the flux above 1 tev of it is similar to that of sn1006 ( enomoto et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "those features looks inconsistent with the scenario of the ic model .",
    "future analyses of sn1006 and rxj1713.7@xmath33946 will soon provide both the differential spectra between @xmath2 300 gev and @xmath2 10 tev and the image of tev gamma ray emission respectively , which will tell us what kind of particle is accelerated and generates tev gamma rays in each snr .",
