    "nonlocal models are currently used in a large variety of applications , including continuum mechanics @xcite , graph theory @xcite , nonlocal wave equations @xcite , and jump processes @xcite .",
    "our interest is in nonlocal diffusion operators that arise in many fields where the phenomena can not be modeled accurately by the standard classical diffusion equation . among those applications we have image analyses @xcite , machine learning @xcite , nonlocal dirichlet forms @xcite , kinetic equations @xcite , phase transitions @xcite , and nonlocal heat conduction @xcite .",
    "the principal difference between nonlocal models and the classical ( local ) partial differential equations ( pdes ) is in how two or more domains interact . in the local case interactions",
    "only occur due to contact , whereas in the nonlocal case they can occur at distance .",
    "consider an open bounded domain @xmath0 in @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath2 , the action of the nonlocal diffusion operator @xmath3 on the function @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 where the kernel @xmath6 is a non - negative symmetric mapping ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , and the diffusion parameter @xmath8 is a positive function .",
    "we are interested in the nonlocal steady - state diffusion equation @xmath9 where the equality constraint ( the nonlocal counterpart of a dirichlet boundary condition for pdes ) acts on an interaction volume @xmath10 that is disjoint from @xmath0 .",
    "nonlocal diffusion problems such as have been analyzed in the recent works @xcite , and techniques for an accurate numerical solution have been developed and applied to diverse applications @xcite .",
    "however , these mathematical models are not exact ; parameters such as volume constraint data , diffusivity coefficients , and source terms are often unknown or subject to uncertainty .",
    "this fact affects the quality of the computational results and their reliability , making necessary the development of techniques for the identification of model parameters . in the classical local case ,",
    "i.e. , for pdes , a widely used approach is to formulate the problem as an optimal control problem having the unknown parameters acting as control variables ; here , we follow the same approach for nonlocal problems .",
    "control problems for nonlocal diffusion equations have already been addressed in @xcite where , for the same nonlocal model , the control variable is the source term @xmath11 ; this results in a _ linear _ optimization problem constrained by the nonlocal equation .",
    "the case treated in this work is more complex ( as its local counterpart is ) because of its _ nonlinearity _ and thus requires more sophisticated techniques for analyzing the well - posedness and designing finite dimensional approximations .",
    "the estimation problem must rely on some additional a priori information , e.g. , a target or reference function for the function of interest @xmath12 . in our context , we formulate the parameter identification as the problem of finding @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath12 is as close as possible to a target function @xmath14 under the constraint that @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfy the nonlocal problem .    the main contribution of this work is to show that we can mimic the approaches of the classical control theory for pdes and to show that by using nonlocal models one can obtain accurate estimates of non - smooth and discontinuous diffusion parameters , a case that often arises in practice .",
    "our analysis is based on the nonlocal vector calculus introduced in @xcite which is exploited to define a variational formulation of the nonlocal equation and for studying the well - posedness of the control problem .",
    "the use of the nonlocal calculus is crucial , as is the classical calculus in the pde setting , to the analyses .",
    "in fact , it helps one avoid more cumbersome direct approaches to deriving the results we present in this work .",
    "relevant aspects of the nonlocal calculus are reviewed in section [ nlvc ] . in section [ sec : control ]",
    "we formulate the identification problem as a control problem and we demonstrate the existence of at least one optimal solution . in section [ fin_dim_approx ]",
    "we study finite dimensional approximations of the optimal state and control and , for finite element approximations , we derive a priori error estimates . in section [ num_tests ]",
    "we present numerical tests conducted on one - dimensional problems and illustrate the theoretical results of section [ fin_dim_approx ] .",
    "these numerical results serve as a base for two- and three - dimensional simulations and show that by using nonlocal models it is possible to accurately approximate non - smooth parameter functions . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we provide a few concluding remarks .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in this section we present the basic notions of the nonlocal vector calculus , recall some theoretical results that are useful to us in this work , and introduce nonlocal diffusion problems .",
    "a detailed introduction to the nonlocal vector calculus can be found in @xcite . here",
    ", we limit the discussion to the tools that we use throughout the paper . for the vector mappings @xmath15 , with @xmath16 antisymmetric ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) , the action of the nonlocal divergence operator @xmath18 on @xmath19 is defined as    [ ndivgrad ] @xmath20    the action of the adjoint operator @xmath21 on a mapping @xmath22 @xmath23 is given by @xmath24    thus , @xmath25 defines a nonlocal gradient operator .",

    "given an open subset @xmath35 , we define the interaction domain corresponding to @xmath0 as @xmath36 thus , @xmath10 consists of those points outside of @xmath0 that interact with points in @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the domains @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath37 are bounded with piecewise smooth boundary and satisfy the interior cone condition .",

    "this implies that @xmath43    in @xcite ( and also in @xcite ) several choices for the kernel @xmath32 are considered and analyzed . here ,",
