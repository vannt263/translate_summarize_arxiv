    "the era of _ precision cosmology _ has opened the way to a new picture of the universe depicted as a spatially flat manifold with a subcritical matter content undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion . although totally unexpected only few years ago , this scenario is nowadays fully accepted as the standard one , thanks to the impressive amount of astrophysical evidences on different scales .",
    "the anisotropy spectrum of cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , the sneia hubble diagram @xcite , the large scale structure @xcite and the matter power spectrum determined by the ly@xmath1 forest data @xcite represent observational cornerstones that put on firm grounds the picture of this kind of universe model .    while observationally well founded , this scenario is plagued by the unsolved puzzle of _ dark energy _ , the negative pressure fluid which seems to be necessary to both close the universe and drive its accelerated expansion . investigating the nature and",
    "the properties of this mysterious component is one of the most exciting problems of modern cosmology , with proposals ranging from the classical cosmological constant @xcite , to scalar field quintessence @xcite and unified dark energy models in which a single fluid with an exotic equation of state accounts for both dark energy and dark matter @xcite .    notwithstanding",
    "the strong efforts made to solve this puzzle , none of the proposed explanations is fully satisfactory and free of problems .",
    "this disturbing situation has motivated much interest towards radically different approaches to the problem of dark energy .",
    "after all , dark energy is usually introduced only as a tool to explain the cosmic acceleration , while there is no direct evidence of its existence as a separate fluid . motivated by this consideration , it has been suggested that cosmic speed up could be an evidence for the need of _ new physics _ rather than a new fluid .",
    "much interest has then been devoted , for example , to models according to which standard matter is the only physical ingredient , while the friedmann equations are modified as in the cardassian expansion @xcite , the dvali - gabadadze - porrati scenario @xcite or the improved renormalization group approach @xcite .    in this same framework , higher order theories of gravity also represent a valid alternative to the dark energy approach . in these models , also referred to as _ curvature quintessence _",
    "@xcite , the gravity lagrangian is generalized by replacing the ricci scalar curvature @xmath2 with a generic function @xmath0 , so that an effective dark energy - like fluid appears in the friedmann equations and drives the accelerated expansion .",
    "reasons for considering non linear curvature terms in the gravity lagrangian can be found , for instance , in quantum effects on curved spacetimes or in certain low energy limits of string / m theories . moreover , early time inflationary behaviours can be naturally recovered from nonlinear gravity lagrangians thus further motivating to study possible effects of such terms on the late time universe expansion .",
    "different models of this kind have been explored and tested against observations also considering the two possible formulations that are obtained adopting the metric @xcite or the palatini @xcite formulations .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that , under some quite general conditions , the dynamics ( i.e. , the scale factor and the expansion rate ) of a given dark energy model may be , in principle , reproduced as a byproduct of a @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "the method developed in @xcite makes it possible to derive the @xmath0 theory which reproduces a given @xmath3 and represents therefore a sort of _ bridge _ between two physically different scenarios . here ,",
    "we apply the method to a quintessence model where the evolution of the scalar field is determined by an exponential potential @xcite . since this model has been shown to fit well a large set of observational constraints @xcite , we are thus able to recover a @xmath0 theory that reproduces the same data set with the same accuracy , so being motivated _ a posteriori _ and showing that the two approaches are phenomenologically equivalent .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sects.ii and iii",
    ", we shortly review the main features of the dark energy model and of the curvature quintessence scenario , respectively . in sect.iii ,",
    "the procedure adopted to recover the @xmath0 theory representing the higher order counterpart of a given dark energy model is presented . in sect.iv , we use conformal transformations to show the equivalence between a class of @xmath0 theories and a given scalar field model with exponential potential .",
    "since this equivalence only holds in absence of matter , sect.iv presents the results obtained applying the method outlined in sect.iii to recover the @xmath0 lagrangian corresponding to the exponential potential model in presence of the matter term .",
    "some caveats related to our technique are commented upon in sect.v , where we also summarize and conclude .",
    "a standard recipe to explain the observed cosmic acceleration consists in considering a scalar field @xmath4 minimally coupled to gravity yielding a homogenously distributed fluid with a negative equation of state . the energy density and pressure for such a fluid read . ]    @xmath5    with an overdot denoting derivation with respect to cosmic time @xmath6 and @xmath7 the self interaction potential .",
    "as it is clear , the choice of @xmath7 plays a key role in determining the dynamics of the universe .    as an interesting application",
    ", we consider the simple exponential potential @xcite :    @xmath8    which presents the nice feature that the corresponding friedmann equations may be analytically solved .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite , while here we only report the quantities we will need in the following . in a spatially flat universe , the scale factor @xmath9 and the hubble parameter @xmath10 read @xcite :    @xmath11 \\frac{\\tau^2}{2 } \\",
    ", \\label{eq : atsingle}\\ ] ]    @xmath12}{3 \\tau \\left [ 2 \\left ( 3 { \\cal{h}}_0 - 2 \\right ) \\tau^2 + 4 - 3 { \\cal{h}}_0 \\right ] } \\label{eq : htsingle}\\ ] ]    with @xmath13 , @xmath14 the present age of the universe and @xmath15 the hubble constant in units of @xmath14 and hereon the subscript 0 will refer to quantities evaluated today .",
    "taking @xmath14 as unit of time , the model is fully characterized by the parameter @xmath15 . in particular , the present day matter density parameter turns out to be @xcite :    @xmath16    which , for the best fit value @xmath17 @xcite , gives @xmath18 , in very good agreement with recent estimates .",
    "much interest has been recently devoted to the so called curvature quintessence according to which the universe is filled by pressureless dust matter only and the acceleration is the result of the modified friedmann equations obtained by replacing the ricci scalar curvature @xmath2 with a generic function @xmath0 in the gravity lagrangian .",
    "the friedmann equations therefore read @xcite :    @xmath19   \\ , \\label{eq : hfr}\\ ] ]    @xmath20    where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath21 is the energy density of an _ effective curvature fluid _ given as :    @xmath22 - 3 h \\dot{r } f''(r ) \\right \\ } \\ , \\label{eq : rhocurv}\\ ] ]    and the barotropic factor of the curvature fluid is :    @xmath23 } { \\left [ f(r ) - r f'(r ) \\right ] /2 - 3 h \\dot{r } f''(r ) } \\label{eq : wcurv}\\ ] ]    assuming that there is no interaction between matter and curvature terms , the continuity equation for @xmath21 reads @xcite :    @xmath24 ^ 2 }   a^{-3 } \\label{eq : curvcons}\\ ] ]    which is identically satisfied as can be easily shown using eq.([eq : hfr ] ) and expressing the scalar curvature @xmath2 as function of the hubble parameter : @xmath25 combining eqs.([eq : hfr ] ) with eq.([eq : fried2 ] ) and using the definition of @xmath26 , one finally gets the following _ master equation _ for the hubble parameter @xcite :    @xmath27 \\right \\ } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : presingleeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    inserting eq.([eq : rvsh ] ) into eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) , one ends with a fourth order nonlinear differential equation for the scale factor @xmath28 that can not be analitically solved also for the simplest cases ( for instance , @xmath29 unless dust matter contribution is discarded ) .",
    "moreover , although technically feasible , a numerical solution of eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) is plagued by the large uncertainties on the boundary conditions ( i.e. , the present day values of the scale factor and its derivatives up to the third order ) that have to be set to find out @xmath28 by solving eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) .    given these mathematical difficulties , a different approach has been proposed in @xcite ( hereafter cct ) where eq.([eq : presingleeq ] ) is considered as a way to determine @xmath0 rather than @xmath28 . rearranging the different terms suitably , cct obtained a linear third order differential equation for @xmath30 in terms of the redshift @xmath31 ( having set @xmath32 ) that can be easily solved numerically for a given @xmath3 . by this method , it is then possible to find out which @xmath0 theory reproduces the same dynamics of a given dark energy model , thus showing a formal equivalence between these two radically different approaches .",
    "cct developed the method using the redshift @xmath33 as integration variable since it is common to have an analytical expression for the hubble parameter as function of @xmath33 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "however , this is not the case for the models considered here , so that we rewrite the main formulae in cct using @xmath6 as integration variable . the equation determining @xmath34 is then rather than @xmath35 $ ] . ] :    @xmath36    with : @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath2 is given by eq.([eq : rvsh ] ) . in order to integrate eq.([eq : singleeq ] ) , we need to specify boundary conditions that are more conveniently assigned at the present time . we slightly generalize here the discussion presented in cct .",
    "first , let us remember that , in a fourth order theory , we may define an _ effective gravitational constant _ as @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the usual newtonian gravitational constant",
    ". its rate of variation will be given as :    @xmath42    it is quite natural to assume that the effective and the newtonian gravitational couplings take the same values today , so that we get the condition :    @xmath43    evaluating eq.([eq : geffvar ] ) for @xmath44 ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) , we may determine @xmath46 provided an estimate of @xmath47 is given .",
    "since in our theory @xmath41 is constant , we may assume that the measurements of the variation of @xmath41 @xcite actually refers to @xmath48 and use these results to get an estimate of @xmath47 .",
    "we thus take as our boundary condition :    @xmath49    having used eq.([eq : in1 ] ) . finally , inserting eqs.([eq : in1 ] ) and ( [ eq : in2 ] ) into eq.([eq : rhocurv ] ) and then in ( [ eq : hfr ] ) evaluated today , we get :    @xmath50    it is then straightforward to show that the following boundary conditions descend from eqs.([eq : in2])-([eq : in0 ] ) :    @xmath51    @xmath52    that have to be used , together with eq.([eq : in0 ] ) , to numerically solve eq.([eq : singleeq ] ) . combining the solution",
    "thus obtained for @xmath34 with @xmath53 evaluated through eq.([eq : rvsh ] ) , one finally finds @xmath0 thus recovering the higher order theory that mimicks the assigned dark energy model .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for some interesting examples .",
    "the procedure described above may be easily implemented in the case of the exponential potential model presented in sect.ii . neglecting the matter term ( i.e. , setting @xmath54 )",
    ", it is however possible to show that there exists a more intimate relation between @xmath0 theories and a scalar field evolving under the action of an exponential potential .    to this aim ,",
    "let us remember that , in general , given a @xmath0 theory in the jordan frame , the conformal transformation    @xmath55    with @xmath56 , leads , in the einstein frame , to a minimally coupled scalar field theory whose self interaction potential is given by @xcite :    @xmath57 ^ 2 } \\",
    ", \\label{eq : potconf}\\ ] ]    where tilted quantities refer to the einstein frame .",
    "let us now consider the particular choice :    @xmath58    and recall that the conformal factor may also be rescaled as @xmath59 with @xmath60 an ( up to now ) arbitrary constant @xcite .",
    "imposing @xmath61 and solving with respect to @xmath2 , the potential ( [ eq : potconf ] ) may be rewritten as :    @xmath62    where we have assumed @xmath63 and hereon we will use nontilted quantities for simplicity . choosing @xmath64 and considering the limit @xmath65 , the potential ( [ eq : potconfbis ] ) asymptotically behaves as :    @xmath66    which is just the exponential potential model we are considering in eq.([eq : exppot ] ) .    on the other hand , starting directly with @xmath67 , the potential in eq.([eq : potconfbis ] ) is soon written as    @xmath68    so that    @xmath69 ^ 2 } \\ , \\ ] ]    having used @xmath70 .",
    "now , it can be easily shown that posing    @xmath71    with @xmath72 an arbitrary constant , leads to @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an integration constant and @xmath75 . therefore , starting now from    @xmath76    the potential in eq.([eq : potconfbis ] ) becomes    @xmath77    @xmath78    with @xmath79 .    assuming @xmath80 and @xmath81 gives    @xmath82    so that we get the nice result that a higher order theory of gravity ( without matter , anyway ) with    @xmath83    is conformally transformed into a usual minimally coupled general relativistic theory with a massive scalar field @xmath4 only , whose potential is    @xmath84    by means of conformal transformations , it is then possible to find out an intimate link between two different scenarios , namely a particularly simple class of @xmath0 theories and a minimally coupled scalar field with specific exponential potential .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that the above results only hold in the absence of matter .",
    "while it is still possible to work out a conformal transformation also in presence of matter , the self interaction potential may be no more expressed as in eq.([eq : potconf ] ) .",
    "although such a problem may be in principle escaped by resorting to numerical methods , it is nevertheless problematic to assess the meaning of conformal transformations , since there is a still open debate regarding the _ physical _ equivalence of two conformally ( and hence _ mathematically _ ) equivalent theories ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the dark energy model presented in sect.ii has nice features both from the mathematical and the physical points of view .",
    "indeed , the main dynamical quantities ( such as the scale factor and the expansion rate ) may be written analytically , while it very well matches the sneia hubble diagram , the growth index and the position of the peaks in the cmbr anisotropy spectrum .",
    "it is , therefore , interesting to apply the method outlined above to find out the @xmath0 counterpart of this model . to this aim ,",
    "we just need to insert the expressions for @xmath28 and @xmath85 into eqs.([eq : singleeq])-[eq : in1bis ] ) and numerically determine first @xmath34 and then @xmath0 . as a preliminary step",
    ", we set @xmath17 as obtained in @xcite . to estimate @xmath46 through eq.([eq : in2 ] ) , we use @xmath86 @xcite and @xmath87 that is the upper limit determined through heliosismological studies @xcite . note that this choice is somewhat arbitrary since there are a lot of different estimates obtained with radically different methods @xcite .",
    "for instance , using lunar laser ranging , williams et al .",
    "@xcite have recently obtained @xmath88 .",
    "fortunately , most of the estimates available in literature are all consistent within the uncertainties so that we are confident that any bias is not introduced in the reconstruction process .    before discussing the results",
    ", there is a conceptual point to clarify .",
    "the method described in sect.iii represents a sort of _ bridge _ between two different scenarios .",
    "in particular , their matter contents could be different , so that we should define both @xmath89 and @xmath90 to denote this quantity in the two different models . in principle",
    ", there is no reason why @xmath91 should hold .",
    "however , since @xmath90 is close to the fiducial value ( @xmath92 ) suggested by model independent estimates ( e.g. , from galaxy clusters abundance ) , we take @xmath91 .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath34 for the exponential potential model is shown in fig.[fig : ftsingle ] , where we plot @xmath93 as function of the dimensionless time @xmath94 .",
    "it is , however , more interesting to look at fig.[fig : frsingle ] , where @xmath95 is plotted in terms of the scalar curvature @xmath2 normalized to its present day value @xmath96 .",
    "although an analytical solution has not been obtained , we have found that the numerically reconstructed lagrangian may be very well approximated / f(r)$ ] , with @xmath30 and @xmath97 the numerically reconstructed and the approximating @xmath0 , we get @xmath98 over the full time range @xmath99 , which is indeed quite satisfactory . ] as :    @xmath100 \\ln{\\left ( \\frac{r}{r_0 } \\right ) } \\right \\ } \\ , \\nonumber \\label{eq : frfit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the parameters @xmath101 depend on the value adopted for @xmath46 . for our case ,",
    "it is :    @xmath102    the approximating function in eq.(33 ) indeed shows to be a useful tool to discuss the main features of the reconstructed @xmath0 .    first , let us note that , for @xmath103 ( that is , for very small @xmath94 ) , the second term in the square brackets may be neglected and @xmath104",
    ". this model can be particularly interesting in the early universe , where it allows inflation @xcite . in our case , however , this regime is achieved also during the recombination epoch , when nucleosynthesis took place . in this limit , one should expect that standard general relativity ( i.e. , @xmath105 ) is recovered in order to not alter the successful theory of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "actually , the formation of light elements depends on the physics of nuclear reactions that , of course , is independent of the form of @xmath0 and on the expansion rate @xmath85 setting the beginning and the end of the nucleosynthesis process .",
    "this latter ingredient is the same in our model as in the standard recipe , since @xmath0 has been reconstructed in such a way that @xmath85 has the same functional dependence on @xmath6 as in the model with a scalar field and no departures from general relativity . as such",
    ", we conclude that having a nonstandard @xmath0 during the recombination epoch does not affect the process of formation of primordial elements .",
    "as the time increases , the @xmath0 never approaches a linear function , so that the general relativity lagrangian @xmath106 is never approached .",
    "in particular , for @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) , both terms in eq.(33 ) contribute to the lagrangian giving rise to large departures from the standard model . considering that the typical galaxy formation redshift is of order @xmath109",
    ", it could thus be interesting to investigate whether this could have any impact on the theory of galaxy formation .    for @xmath110 (",
    "i.e. , for @xmath111 , part of the redshift range probed by the sneia hubble diagram ) , the best fitting function significantly differs from standard general relativity as expected .",
    "moreover , we note that @xmath0 is neither a simple power law in @xmath2 ( or a combination of power law functions ) , nor a logarithmic one . this could be surprising since both these classes of lagrangians have been widely discussed in literature and found to be in agreement with the data .",
    "actually , it is well known that the data do not select a unique class of models ( dark energy - like or higher order gravity theories ) . moreover , the reconstructed @xmath0 predicts the same dynamics of the scalar field model with the exponential potential , so that we are sure that it fits the data equally well .",
    "however , it is intriguing to note that the approximating function is a combination of both ( power law and logarithmic ) classes of @xmath0 theories .",
    "summarizing , we may conclude that the @xmath0 theory reconstructed starting from the exponential potential is able to solve the puzzle of cosmic acceleration resorting to corrections to general relativity that are significative both in the early and late universe .",
    "as we have discussed , however , considering @xmath105 during the nucleosynthesis epoch is not mandatory to get the correct abundance of light nuclei , so that this argument may not be used to reject the reconstructed @xmath0 s .    on the other hand",
    ", the impact of strong departures from general relativity during the galaxy formation epoch should be investigated with much care . actually , while the time scale of the process is unaltered since the expansion rate of the universe is the same , the physics of the gravitational collapse giving rise to the protogalactic clouds may be different in a fourth order theory with respect to quintessence models ( independent of the shape of the potential ) . indeed , the newtonian potential obtained considering the weak field limit of a particular class of these theories ( namely @xmath29 ) is modified and a corrective term as @xmath112 has to be added to the @xmath113 newtonian term @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth noting that it is indeed possible that the strength of the correction is too low to significantly alter the process , so that any difference could be hardly detected .",
    "there is a subtle point to be discussed inherently to the the peculiar nature of the reconstruction procedure we have employed .",
    "as explained in sect.iii , we have set boundary conditions at the present time and integrated eq.([eq : singleeq ] ) backward in time . as an alternative procedure",
    ", one could give boundary conditions at some very far point in the past and then integrate forward .",
    "indeed , a possible strategy could be to impose that @xmath114 ( and hence @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) with @xmath117 and @xmath118 , that is , to impose that standard general relativity is recovered during the recombination epoch .",
    "performing such a reconstruction , we infact get a @xmath0 function that departs from the general relativistic one ( @xmath106 ) only in the recent epochs , so that all the successful results of the standard theory are automatically retained .",
    "although such a feature is highly desirable , this approach is manifestly biased by theoretical prejudices .",
    "after all , there is no aprioristic reason why @xmath0 should be linear in @xmath2 on scales that have never been directly probed by observations .",
    "it is also interesting to stress that the reconstructed @xmath0 is by no way unique since different boundary conditions lead to diverse @xmath0 theories , all sharing the feature of giving rise to the same expressions for the hubble parameter and the scale factor .",
    "this result does not come as a surprise . for each @xmath0 , there is a different lagrangian giving rise to a particular set of field equations .",
    "since these latter are nonlinear , there may be , in general , more than one solution , and it is thus not unlikely that a given solution is common to more than one @xmath0 theory .",
    "going backward from solutions to @xmath0 therefore can not uniquely determine @xmath0 , and this explains why using different boundary conditions leads to different higher order theories .",
    "we stress , however , that this can not be considered as a weakness of our reconstruction procedure .",
    "our aim is , in fact , to find out a class of @xmath0 theories able to reproduce a given cosmological dynamics , and this is indeed what we do successfully .",
    "choosing among the possible theories can only be done by carefully investigating what are the most suitable boundary conditions .",
    "this is outside the aim of the present work , but will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "while the reconstructed @xmath0 correctly works on cosmological scales , its consequences on the solar system dynamics are worth investigating .",
    "actually , this is an open problem for all the class of fourth order theories and , up to now , no definitive conclusions have been drawn .",
    "a possible way out is to evaluate ppn parameters for the case of @xmath0 gravity exploiting the analogy between fourth order theories and scalar - tensor ones .",
    "such an analysis has been indeed performed by some of us @xcite and will be presented in a forthcoming work .    as a concluding remark",
    ", we would like to emphasize the resulting substantial equivalence between two radically different scenarios , namely scalar field quintessence and fourth order theory of gravity .",
    "since it is possible to find @xmath0 in such a way that the same dynamics is predicted by the two models , infact , we are in presence of an intrinsic degeneracy that can not be broken by observations probing only dynamical quantities ( but see the discussion in the concluding section of @xcite ) .",
    "while this is bad news for observational cosmology , it is a _ call to army _ for theoreticians to look for suitable and self consistent motivations to choose between these two equivalent approaches to the dark energy puzzle .",

    "<S> it has been recently shown that , under some general conditions , it is always possible to find a fourth order gravity theory capable of reproducing the same dynamics of a given dark energy model . here , we discuss this approach for a dark energy model with a scalar field evolving under the action of an exponential potential . in absence of matter , such a potential can be recovered from a fourth order theory via a conformal transformation . including the matter term , the function @xmath0 entering the generalized gravity lagrangian can be reconstructed according to the dark energy model . </S>"
