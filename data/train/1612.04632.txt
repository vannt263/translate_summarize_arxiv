    "symbiotic stars ( syst ) are among the longest orbital period interacting binaries .",
    "they are composed of a cool giant as the primary component and a secondary that is a remnant of the latest stages of stellar evolution  typically a white dwarf ( wd ) but",
    "a neutron star is also suggested in a few cases .",
    "the giant member is losing matter at a high rate , up to about 10@xmath4myr@xmath3 , a rate systematically higher than for single field giants ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "interactions of the mass flow with hard radiation from the hot , luminous remnant results in a complex environment around each component of the system with many systems being embedded in an ionized nebula .",
    "the bulk of the giant s mass outflow ultimately can be lost from the system . however",
    ", a substantial part can be accreted on to the compact object directly from the giant wind and/or via roche lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "when the system formed the current remnant was the more massive component .",
    "as this star evolved , mass was transferred on to the star that is now the giant and traces of this mass transfer may be detectable in the observed chemical composition of the current red giant .",
    "there is clear evidence for this history of binary evolution in the s - type symbiotic systems .",
    "most systems have orbital periods below @xmath21000d and circularized orbits that indicate that mass transfer and strong interactions took place before the present wd was formed @xcite .",
    "chemical composition is secondary only to initial stellar mass in determining stellar evolution . in binary systems where abundances are modified due to mass transfer",
    ", the information about single and binary evolution becomes entangled .",
    "however , abundances of some specific kinds of chemical elements , eg.s - process elements produced during the agb phase and/or cno abundances , combined with theoretical limitations and known basic parameters of the stars in the system enable us to deduce the interactions and history of the mass exchange between components .",
    "this motivated us to determine chemical abundances in s - type symbiotic giants with the goal of understanding their evolution .",
    "including new results presented here abundances are known for more than 40 red giants in syst . statistical analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paperiii ) addresses metallicity ( from its proxy the iron abundance ) , evolutionary status ( by analysis of carbon and nitrogen abundances and @xmath5c/@xmath6c ratio ) , and galactic population membership ( by analysis of the alpha - element abundances , titanium and oxygen , relative to iron ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present chemical compositions ( abundances of cno and elements around the iron peak : fe , ti , ni ) for a sample of 13 red giants in s - type symbiotic systems located in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the abundances are measured using high - resolution near - ir spectra .",
    "this is another step in building a statistical base for future analysis of syst samples representing all stellar populations and various locations in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
