    "the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) refers to an excess transverse hall voltage arising from the influence of spin - orbit coupling on the motion of charge carriers in a spin polarized metal .",
    "the phenomenon first attracted attention several decades ago @xcite and still continues as an active area for theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite inquiry .",
    "calculations have identified two classes of underlying mechanisms for the ahe : `` extrinsic '' contributions originating from the spin - dependent scattering of carriers by impurities @xcite and `` intrinsic '' ones that involve the interaction of carrier spins with the inherent crystal band structure @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments have aimed to identify the mechanisms responsible for the ahe in different materials ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete bibliography ) .",
    "this is commonly addressed by examining a scaling relationship of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7  and @xmath8  are the longitudinal and transverse resistivity , respectively .",
    "theory predicts @xmath9 for the intrinsic mechanism @xcite . in the extrinsic case ,",
    "the exponent depends on the nature of the spin dependent scattering mechanism : @xmath10 for skew scattering @xcite and @xmath11 for the side jump mechanism @xcite .",
    "three regimes emerge from these experimental studies @xcite :    * at low disorder , the scaling exponent @xmath12 , suggesting that the ahe is dominated by skew scattering ; * at moderate disorder , @xmath13 , resulting in a hall conductivity @xmath14   which is independent of disorder ( since @xmath15 ) .",
    "this scaling is consistent with both the intrinsic mechanism and the extrinsic side - jump mechanism , but it is difficult to convincingly distinguish between these using dc transport ; * at large disorder , numerical calculations report @xmath16 . while there is no simple physical explanation for this behavior , this scaling does appear to emerge from numerical calculations of the anomalous conductivity in the hopping regime @xcite .",
    "a cautionary note arises in the interpretation of such experimental data : the analysis of the scaling relationship should strictly be carried out at temperatures where impurity scattering dominates and other inelastic processes ( such as scattering from spin waves ) have been frozen out .    in this paper , we describe measurements of the ahe in a canonical ferromagnetic semiconductor ( @xmath1 ) over a large temperature range ( 100 mk @xmath17150 k ) .",
    "our study is restricted to samples whose resistivity lies in a regime 2 @xmath18 10 @xmath19 where other studies @xcite have observed an ahe scaling exponent @xmath20 at @xmath21 k. these observations have been interpreted as an insensitivity to disorder and thus as a signature of the intrinsic mechanism @xcite , in agreement with theoretical predictions made in the disorder - free limit @xcite . however , we argue that unlike metallic ferromagnets where the drude approximation works well at helium temperatures , the complex non - monotonic temperature dependence of the resistivity in @xmath1  provides strong motivation for systematic measurements at lower ( dilution fridge ) temperatures where impurity scattering is dominant . our principal aim is to test the robustness of the scaling relationship by examining it at such lower temperatures .",
    "our study also allows us to address another interesting question that has thus far been ignored in @xmath1 : what ( if any ) are the quantum corrections to the anomalous hall conductivity ?",
    "this question is particularly germane within the context of @xmath1  where the confluence of ferromagnetism , disorder and interactions invariably occurs in close vicinity of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite .",
    "earlier studies @xcite on metallic ferromagnets in the weak disorder limit ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fermi wave vector and the elastic mean free path , respectively ) show that the quantum correction to the anomalous hall conductivity is distinctly different for the skew scattering and side jump mechanisms , thus providing an alternative route to test the origin of the ahe .",
    "we are however unaware of any theoretical calculations addressing the corresponding quantum correction for the intrinsic mechanism .",
    "our measurements center on a set of five @xmath1  samples grown by low temperature molecular beam epitaxy , with mn composition in the range @xmath25 .",
    "the samples are all 120 nm thick , with the exception of the sample with @xmath26 which is 50 nm thick .",
    "a detailed description of the growth and characterization of these samples has been provided earlier @xcite . in order to generate a larger phase space of conductivity ,",
    "we measure both as - grown and annealed pieces of these samples .",
    "the annealing is known to simultaneously increase the hole density and decrease the disorder by reducing the density of hole - compensating mn interstitial defects @xcite .",
    "transport measurements are carried out on lithographically defined hall bars ( 400 @xmath27 m @xmath28 100 @xmath27 m ) in a quantum design dilution refrigerator with the sample temperature ranging from 100 mk to 4 k. ( although the nominal base temperature of the dilution fridge is 50 mk , we find that samples do not cool down efficiently below 100 mk and thus exclude the corresponding data from our analysis . )",
    "we measure longitudinal and transverse resistances simultaneously using a standard double lock - in technique with an a.c .",
    "excitation of 100 na ( optimal for measuring the small hall signal while minimizing sample heating ) . to avoid contributions to the small hall voltage from the significantly larger longitudinal voltage ,",
    "we carry out measurements at positive and negative applied magnetic field @xmath29 t ( sufficient to fully polarize magnetic domains ) and use the standard anti - symmetrization procedure .",
    "we note that  due to the large hole density ( @xmath30 )  the contribution of the ordinary hall effect is negligible compared to the ahe .",
    "since our analysis relies on knowledge of the hole carrier density , we also note that the values used here are determined using raman measurements @xcite , reducing the uncertainties that are typically involved in deducing the carrier density in the presence of the ahe .",
    "we first address the temperature dependence of the zero field conductivity ( @xmath31=1/@xmath7 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) for two extremes in our sample set : the as grown sample with @xmath32 has the lowest value of @xmath31 , while the annealed sample with @xmath33 has the highest @xmath31 .",

    ", we conclude that our data is most appropriately described by @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , a plot of @xmath31  vs. @xmath4 shows a linear dependence over almost two decades of variation in @xmath39 ( fig . [ figure1](b ) ) .",
    "as we discuss below , the @xmath4 dependence of conductivity in 3d disordered systems has been predicted within the context of the scaling theory of localization in the  dirty metal \" regime @xcite .",
    "we note that other studies of the temperature - dependent conductivity in @xmath1  have taken a different interpretation , assigning a @xmath31@xmath40 dependence which arises from electron - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "however , forcing a @xmath41 fit to our data yields a systematic variation in the residual plot , leading us to discount this dependence as providing a physically meaningful description of the data .",
    "we also note that the @xmath40 dependence is derived from perturbative calculations that apply only to weakly disordered systems ( @xmath42 ) , while even the best @xmath1  samples fabricated to date are highly disordered and always close to the mit . for the samples studied here",
    ", we estimate drude values of @xmath43 nm and @xmath44 using the extrapolated zero temperature values of @xmath31 .",

    "solid lines are linear fits.,width=302 ]    as first pointed out by altshuler and aronov @xcite , in the vicinity of the mit , the disorder - dependent correlation length is larger than relevant temperature - dependent length scales , resulting in a temperature variation of the scale dependence of the diffusion constant @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the weak disorder regime where @xmath48 is independent of temperature .",
    "one possibility is that the dominant temperature dependent length scale is the interaction length defined as @xmath49 : physically , this characterizes the length over which coherence is maintained during the elastic scattering of quasiparticles that lie within @xmath50 of the fermi energy . in this case",

    ", the dephasing rate is @xmath56 and the prefactor of @xmath4 is @xmath57 .",
    "a relevant dephasing mechanism in `` dirty metals '' is that due to the electron - electron interaction @xcite ; in this case , @xmath58 . hence , the prefactor @xmath59 should depend on both disorder and carrier density .",
    "we note that in @xmath1  other possible dephasing mechanisms may also exist , including scattering from spin waves or from two level systems formed at mn interstitial sites @xcite .",
    "however , we do not anticipate an explicit dependence on disorder in the latter cases .",
    "figure [ figure2](a ) plots the prefactor @xmath59 as a function of the mn concentration ( @xmath60 ) for both as - grown and annealed samples , revealing a non - monotonic dependence wherein @xmath59 reaches a minimum at @xmath61 .",
    "since mn acts both as an acceptor that generates holes and also adds to the disorder in the form of interstitials , we speculate that  for given growth conditions  there exists an optimal mn doping level that maximizes the carrier density and minimizes disorder . further  for a given mn concentration ",
    "@xmath59 is found to decrease upon annealing which is known to increase the hole carrier density .",
    "this is inconsistent with the interaction picture that predicts @xmath59 to increase if @xmath62 increases .",
    "thus , the data in fig.[figure2](a ) indirectly suggest that @xmath59 varies with disorder and that the @xmath4 dependence is possibly due to localization rather than interactions .",
    "( a ) prefactor a vs. mn concentration obtained from numerical fits of the conductivity data to @xmath63 .",
    "( b ) experimental estimate of the density of states @xmath64 vs. hole density .",
    "the solid line shows the expected value for a free electron gas .",

    "the filled and open squares represent as - grown and annealed samples , respectively.,width=302 ]    recent experiments on mesoscopic @xmath1  samples @xcite estimate inelastic path lengths @xmath66 nm for @xmath67 at 10 mk and for @xmath68 at 100 mk , respectively , and a dephasing time @xmath69 that varies inversely with temperature at higher temperatures ( @xmath70 k ) .",
    "this places our samples of thickness @xmath71 nm in the 3d regime ( wherein the film thickness exceeds the inelastic length @xmath72 ) in the temperature range of interest ( 100 mk@xmath73 k ) .",
    "further , if we compare these estimates for the inelastic path lengths with our drude estimates of the elastic path length , we find that the condition @xmath74 is indeed satisfied in our samples .",
    "figure [ figure2](b ) plots the quantity @xmath75 , as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath65(inset ) , where we use @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "note that in the interaction picture @xcite , @xmath51 is indeed the density of states while in the localization case @xcite , @xmath51 depends on both density of states and disorder . as shown in fig.[figure2 ] , @xmath51 does not follow any systematic dependence on @xmath62 and decreases with increasing @xmath77(inset ) , again supporting the localization picture ( the @xmath78 nm samples do not follow the trend ) .",
    "we now address the quantum corrections to @xmath14  by using the temperature variation of @xmath7  and @xmath8 .",
    "we find that for all our samples , both @xmath7  and @xmath8  increase monotonically with decreasing temperature in the range 100 mk@xmath79 k and we observe that the temperature dependence can be fit to the functional form @xmath80 .",
    "thus at @xmath81 k , the resistivity extrapolates to a finite @xmath82 and is found to be positive for both longitudinal and hall components for each sample . to estimate the magnitude of the quantum corrections , we examine the relative changes of the resistivity with respect to the zero temperature value ( @xmath83 .",

    "also , @xmath87 does not show any pronounced temperature dependence and is scattered around zero over the temperature range . using the approximation @xmath88 ,",
    "it is easy to show that the following identity summarizes the universal scaling behavior observed in all our samples : @xmath89 thus , we report a key experimental finding : there are no quantum corrections to @xmath90   in metallic @xmath1   over the temperature range of 100 mk @xmath174 k where @xmath31   exhibits a finite localization correction in the form of @xmath4 .",
    "we are not aware of any theoretical calculations that support our findings in this high disorder regime .",
    "however , we note that calculations of quantum corrections to the anomalous hall conductivity in _ weakly disordered _ ferromagnets @xcite do indeed show that  in contrast to the skew scattering mechanism ",

    "to further corroborate the uniqueness of the low temperature results described above , we carried out measurements on our samples at higher temperatures ( @xmath21 k ) , up to the curie temperature @xmath92  of the samples . not surprisingly , we find that the universal scaling of @xmath7  and @xmath8  ( which leads to a constant @xmath14  at low temperatures ) breaks down at higher temperatures . as is well known , the temperature dependence of @xmath7  shows a peak near @xmath92   and decreases to a minimum around @xmath93  k , showing a much weaker monotonic increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath7  for @xmath91 k has recently been interpreted within a scaling analysis picture that takes into account the competition between localization and the onset of magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath8  and @xmath14  has not been studied previously in great detail over a wide range of samples .",

    "the temperature variation of @xmath8  is non - monotonic over this temperature range . as shown in fig.[figure3](c ) , the relative changes in @xmath8  and @xmath7  increase with the same rate up to @xmath95  k ; at even higher temperatures , @xmath8  decreases rapidly as @xmath92  is approached . in both cases , magnetometry measurements ( data",
    "not shown ) show that the saturated magnetization @xmath96 decreases monotonically as @xmath39 increases .",
    "the observations are consistent with the view that in low @xmath92  ferromagnets such as @xmath1 , magnetic fluctuations play an important role at high temperatures ( @xmath97 k ) and dominate the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xcite . in such regimes , scattering from magnetic impurities may contribute to the ahe with @xmath8  proportional to magnetic fluctuations of the form @xmath98 .",
    "we speculate that this  kondo - type \" ahe may be more relevant at high temperatures .    in this high temperature regime",
    ", @xmath14  decreases monotonically for @xmath21 k , as shown in figs.[figure3](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath31  and @xmath14  clearly demarcates two regimes : at low temperature ( @xmath99 k ) , we find a universal behavior for the entire sample set arising from localization corrections , while at higher temperatures ( @xmath100 k ) , the behavior is completely different and non - universal .",
    "based on the above result , we argue that analyses of the ahe scaling relationship in @xmath1  are only meaningful if they are carried out in the former low temperature regime .",
    "for instance , we obtain identical and consistent results if we carry out the scaling analysis using either the extrapolated zero temperature resistivities ( obtained from the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath7  and @xmath8 ) or using the resistivity value measured at the base temperature of our dilution refrigerator ( @xmath101 mk ) which is a stable , reproducible lowest temperature achievable . in both cases ,",
    "the following results are found to be the same .",
    "however , scaling carried out at higher temperatures produces significant departures .",
    "we now discuss the scaling of our ahe data at low temperature .",
    "we begin with the standard scaling relation of the anomalous hall resistivity normalized by the saturated magnetization @xmath96 ( anomalous hall coefficient ) @xmath102(fig . [ figure4](a ) ) . a log - log plot of @xmath103 vs. @xmath7   shows a linear dependence indicative of a power law behavior of the form @xmath104 .",
    "linear fits to the data yield an exponent of @xmath105 .",
    "this implies that within experimental error @xmath106 is independent of the variation in the hole carrier density @xmath62 and disorder in the sample set under consideration .",
    "however , unlike metallic systems where the above result can perhaps be directly interpreted as a manifestation of the side jump mechanism , the situation in @xmath1  is more complex and requires further examination .",
    "this is because the variation in mn composition between different samples and the annealing of a given sample results in a simultaneous variation of the magnetization , the hole carrier density and the point defect density .    in ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "the magnetization arises directly from the spin imbalance in the conduction band , while the ah voltage arises from spin - dependent scattering and is directly proportional to the magnetization .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1  is not a band ferromagnet and the magnetization is due to the ferromagnetically coupled localized moments on the substitutional mn atoms .",
    "however , the valence band in @xmath1  has a high degree ( @xmath107 ) of spin polarization @xcite .",
    "consequently , if we assume that the net spin imbalance is proportional to the exchange field experienced by the carriers and hence the magnetization ( @xmath108 ) , we encounter a situation similar to a metal as far as the ahe is concerned .",
    "thus , the result shown in fig . [ figure4](a ) can indeed be interpreted as a manifestation of the side jump mechanism .",
    "we estimate the ah conductivity for the side jump mechanism using the simplified expression for a fully spin polarized single band system : @xmath109@xcite . using typical values for the carrier density of @xmath1  in the range of @xmath110",
    ", we estimate @xmath111 @xmath112 ( using @xmath113  0.1 nm ) which is of same order of magnitude as our experimental values of @xmath114 @xmath112 .",
    "( a ) zero temperature ah resistivity normalized by magnetization vs. the zero temperature longitudinal resistivity ; ( b ) zero temperature ah resistivity normalized by magnetization vs. @xmath115 .",
    "linear fits to these log - log plots indicate power law dependence with exponents given by the slopes .",
    "closed ( open ) symbols represent as - grown ( annealed ) samples.,width=302 ]    to further explore the picture of the side jump mechanism assuming full spin polarization of carriers , we examine the scaling behavior of the ah resistivity . if the side jump mechanism indeed contributes to the ah conductivity through the expression given earlier , then we expect that @xmath116 ( assuming for simplicity a free electron dependence @xmath117 ) .",
    "figure [ figure4](b ) shows a plot testing this scaling : excluding the three lowest resistivity samples , a linear fit to the data yields an exponent of @xmath118 , implying both that @xmath14   is independent of disorder and that the data are consistent with the side jump mechanism .",
    "the fact that the high @xmath62 samples deviate downwards from the linear dependence is due to the overestimation of the net spin imbalance in the single band approximation : strictly speaking , the analysis in fig.[figure4](b ) should be carried out with the net carrier spin imbalance ( @xmath119 ) rather than the total carrier density @xmath62 . from the fitting parameters",
    ", we estimate the side jump length to be @xmath120  nm .",
    "much interest has been generated by the theoretical prediction @xcite of `` dissipationless '' anomalous hall current in @xmath1 , originating from purely band structure effects even in the absence of impurity scattering .",
    "calculations in the disorder - free case successfully predict the qualitative features of the ahe ( the sign and rough magnitude of @xmath14 ) in different iii - v dms materials .",
    "as mentioned earlier , recent experiments @xcite carried out at high temperatures ( @xmath121 k ) have been interpreted using this picture of an intrinsic ahe in @xmath1 , albeit with the idealized assumption that compensation is absent . in our sample",
    "set , we estimate @xmath62 to be in the range of 10 - 60% of the total mn dopant concentration , indicating a high degree of compensation due to the presence of interstitials .",
    "the only exception was the annealed sample of @xmath26 , with a thickness of 50 nm that is found to be close to the limit of no compensation .",
    "thus , our data can not provide a rigorous test of the validity of the intrinsic mechanism scenario .",
    "to conclude , we have carried out a systematic study of the temperature dependent longitudinal and anomalous hall conductivity in a ferromagnetic semiconductor close to the the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we find that carrier localization rather than interaction effects provide the dominant quantum correction to @xmath31 , while our data show no quantum corrections to @xmath14 .",
    "further , we find that the absence of temperature dependence in @xmath14  and the scaling relationship between @xmath8  and @xmath7  is consistent with the side jump mechanism for the ahe",
