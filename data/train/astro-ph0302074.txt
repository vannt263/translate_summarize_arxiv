    "the so - called standard model for accretion discs @xcite describes an optically thick , geometrically thin solution to the accretion equations in which all our ignorance about the mechanisms of angular momentum transport and turbulent viscosity is side - stepped by making the ( physically reasonable ) _ ansatz _ that the turbulent stress tensor scales with the local pressure , with a constant of proportionality that we will denote here @xmath3 .",
    "such an approach proved enormously productive , and despite the great development of numerical models in the last decade , standard disc modeling still remains at the very heart of accretion disc phenomenology and the basic link between theory and observations .",
    "the recent evolution of numerical studies , instead , has proved itself fundamental to shed light on the very nature of the @xmath3 prescription , by elucidating the crucial role of mhd turbulence for the enhanced transport properties of accretion discs @xcite . in particular ,",
    "non - radiative flows are ideal objects of study by means of global three dimensional simulations ( see balbus & hawley 2002 and reference therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , the observed spectrum of thin accretion discs around many compact objects suggests that a corona is also present @xcite .",
    "such coronae are most likely a by - product of the internal disc dynamics ( as in the model originally proposed by galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ) and local 3-d mhd simulations of stratified discs @xcite , although adopting a thermodynamics which is most likely inappropriate for the problem at hand , may support this idea .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to incorporate , in the simplest possible way , our current knowledge on the properties of turbulent mhd flows in the standard accretion disc theory .",
    "this will allow us , on the one hand , to extend the predictive power of the standard model by self - consistently including in the theory the magnetic properties of the flow and the generation of a magnetic corona by means of vertical poynting flux ; and on the other hand , to consider mhd turbulent discs in a regime where global , 3-d numerical simulations are currently unable to make predictions , i.e. for highly luminous , radiatively efficient thin discs .",
    "thus , we assume the accretion proceeds through a geometrically thin disc , _  la _ shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , and we employ vertically integrated equations .",
    "furthermore , we assume that magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; see balbus & hawley 1998 , and reference therein ) is the primary source of the turbulent viscosity and , consequently , that the turbulent magnetic stresses responsible for the angular momentum transport in the disc scale with magnetic pressure .",
    "then , the accretion disc structure is fully described once the relationship between magnetic and disc pressure ( given either by gas or radiation ) is established .",
    "the issue of the viscous scaling can be translated into the uncertainty about the mechanisms by , and the level at , which the disc magnetic field saturates . in the following ,",
    "we make the working assumption ( in a sense justified _ a priori _ by the need of explaining the observed presence of strong coronae in many accretion powered systems ) that magnetic field is disposed of mainly by vertical buoyancy @xcite , and verify a posteriori its validity",
    ". then we will show how under this condition , and taking into account the property that mri grows less rapidly in radiation dominated discs , the scaling of magnetic pressure can be determined .",
    "this in turn specifies the closure relation that fully describes a coupled accretion disc  corona system .",
    "furthermore , we will show that by solving the structure equations a new solution is found , which has no analog in the standard shakura - sunyaev theory , and is relevant for highly viscous ( and highly magnetized ) flows accreting at a rate of the order of ( or above ) the eddington one .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd turbulent discs clearly show that the non - linear outcome of the mri is a fully three dimensional , anisotropic turbulence , that exhibits strongly correlated fluctuations in the azimuthal and radial components of velocity ( reynolds stresses ) and magnetic field ( maxwell stress ) . in accordance with those results , and for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the vertically averaged anomalous stress is dominated by maxwell stresses , and therefore @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnetic pressure , @xmath6 is a factor of order unity that depends on the relative intensity of radial and azimuthal field components .",
    "this in turn implies that the local heating rate in a thin keplerian disc is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 keplerian angular velocity , @xmath9 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the growth rate of mri is influenced by the ratio of the gas to magnetic pressure , as demonstrated both by analytical studies of the linear regime of the instability @xcite and by numerical mhd simulations of radiation pressure dominated discs @xcite : both found that , due to the substantial compressibility of mhd turbulence in radiation pressure dominated discs , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gas sound speed .",
    "the magnetic field , with initial ( highly subthermal ) amplitude @xmath12 , rapidly grows to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total disc scaleheight and @xmath15 is the mean buoyant rise - time . in order to estimate the saturation field , an estimate for the upward drift velocity @xmath16 caused by buoyancy of magnetic field",
    "is needed . in the case of uniform discs permeated by a net mean field , where the magnetic field can be modeled as a collection of flux tubes that retain their individuality over time scales much longer than dynamical time , it has been shown @xcite that @xmath17 .",
    "here @xmath18 is the alfvn speed , @xmath19 is a flux tube cross section and @xmath20 a drag coefficient , whose numerical value can be estimated to be @xmath21@xmath22 . if the tube cross section @xmath19 were independent on the ratio of gas to radiation pressure , such an expression for the upward drift velocity would lead to a final scaling of magnetic pressure with the gas pressure only , as already argued in stella & rosner ( 1984 ) .",
    "however , the applicability of a flux tube analysis to the case of mri turbulent flows is not justified",
    ". the work of stone et al .",
    "( 1996 ) clearly demonstrates that magnetic concentrations , although always present , do not persist as coherent structures .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned , the turbulence in radiation pressure dominated discs is compressible . then , in the vertical fluid momentum equation any vertical gradient of the magnetic pressure will not be balanced by either radiation ( because radiation is diffusive ) nor gas pressure ( because azimuthal field energy density may exceed the true gas pressure , see below ) .",
    "vertical motions are excited , with approximately ( see e.g. eq . 4.19 in blaes 2002 )",
    "@xmath23 which would imply ( for a mainly azimuthal field ) a direct proportionality between the vertical drift velocity and the alfvn speed .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath24 with @xmath25 constant of the order of unity .    if we then put together eqs .",
    "( [ eq_bs01 ] ) , ( [ eq_tb ] ) and ( [ eq_vdrift ] ) , we have that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the sum of gas plus radiation pressure . neglecting the logarithmic dependence on the initial field",
    ", this in turn suggests that , in mri dominated turbulent flows , the field will saturate at an amplitude such that @xcite : @xmath28 where we have introduced the constant @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the usual plasma parameter .",
    "it is worth noting here the relationship between the constant @xmath31 and the shakura - sunyaev coefficient @xmath32 ( which is _ not _ constant in our theory ) .",
    "we have @xmath33 the condition that the turbulence be subsonic ( @xmath34 ) implies @xmath35 ( or , equivalently , @xmath36 ) , and from ( [ eq_a_ss ] ) we see that @xmath31 can still be larger than unity , when radiation pressure dominates in the disc .",
    "the magnetic flux escaping in the vertical direction may dissipate a substantial fraction of the gravitational binding energy of the accreting gas _ outside _ the optically thick disc , with obvious deep implications for the spectrum of the emerging radiation @xcite .",
    "how much of this flux really escapes into the low - density environment above and below the disc ( in the so - called _ corona _ ) , depends on the details of vertical transport of magnetic flux tubes and vertical stratification of the disc , which is ignored in our model .",
    "nonetheless , we can safely assume that the fraction of power dissipated in the corona is determined by the ratio @xmath1 of the vertical poynting flux to the local heating rate @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to estimate the vertical poynting flux is to just assume that @xmath38 this translates into ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_heat ] ) @xmath39    in the following , we will assume that the numerical factor ( of the order of unity ) @xmath40 .",
    "differences in its exact value will affect the numerical value of the critical viscosity parameter @xmath31 ( see below ) , but wo nt affect the nature of the solutions we find .",
    "thanks to the closure relation ( [ eq_f ] ) , we are now able to build a self - consistent accretion disc ",
    "corona solution . in order to do so , exactly as in the case of the standard shakura - sunyaev solution , we have to solve simultaneously four conservation equations ( conservation of vertical momentum , mass , angular momentum and energy ) and supplement them with the equations of state for the pressure and opacity as functions of density and temperature . the only modification with respect to the standard derivation",
    "is the reduction of the locally dissipated energy by the factor @xmath41 @xcite , with @xmath1 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_f ] ) , and the adoption of the viscosity law ( [ eq_visc ] ) .    for simplicity",
    ", we present here the solutions in newtonian approximation , as in shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , with an efficiency @xmath42 appropriate for non - rotating black holes ( a full general relativistic analog of the equations below can be found in the appendix of merloni & fabian 2002b ) .",
    "we concentrate only on the innermost regions of the disc , where opacity is dominated by electron scattering ( @xmath43 @xmath44 g@xmath45 ) . introducing dimensionless units for the central mass ( @xmath46 ) , accretion rate ( @xmath47 ) and distance from the center ( @xmath48 ) ,",
    "we obtain , for the radiation pressure dominated solution , the following expressions for disc scaleheight , pressure ( in dyne ) , density ( in g cm @xmath49 ) , both calculated at the disc mid - plane , and temperature ( in k ) :    @xmath50    supplemented with the closure equation for @xmath1 : @xmath51    analogously , in the gas pressure dominated part of the disc , we have : @xmath52 together with @xmath53    in the above formulae , the function @xmath54 , with @xmath55 corresponding to the innermost stable circular orbit of a free particle around a non - rotating black hole , describe the no - torque at the inner boundary condition .",
    "to find all the family of possible solutions , we proceed in the following way : for each set of the parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath31 ) we find the roots of both eq .",
    "( [ eq_fr ] ) and ( [ eq_fg ] ) in the interval @xmath59 .",
    "we then substitute the obtained values of @xmath1 into the appropriate expressions for the gas and radiation pressure and finally discard all the non - consistent solution ( i.e. those found with the formula for gas pressure dominated discs that gives @xmath60 and vice versa ) .    the value of the viscosity parameter @xmath61 is a critical point for the set of equations describing the coupled disc ",
    "corona system , in that it separates two qualitatively different regimes . in the next two sections",
    "we will examine these two regimes , beginning with the low viscosity case .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath62 each set of parameters define a unique solution .",
    "its properties have already been discussed @xcite , but we present them here in a more general framework . the fraction of disc power dissipated in the corona , @xmath1 ,",
    "tends to its maximum value , @xmath63 , when gas pressure dominates ( low accretion rates ) , and decreases as the accretion rate increases and radiation pressure becomes more and more important .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_lowalpha ] , where , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we plot the radial dependence of the coronal fraction for different values of the accretion rate .    as in the standard case , radiation pressure dominated part of the disc are thermally and viscously unstable , although the combined effects of the modified viscosity law ( [ eq_visc ] ) and the stabilizing effect of the corona , reduce the extent of the unstable region of the parameter space @xcite .      the nature of the solutions changes qualitatively if @xmath67 . because in gas pressure dominated parts of the disc @xmath68 , there can be no solutions there with @xmath69",
    "that is to say that the condition @xmath70 should hold in gas pressure dominated discs , and these high viscosity solutions can only exist if radiation pressure dominates .    for each value of @xmath66 the accretion rate @xmath71 ( eq .",
    "[ eq_fr ] ) has a minimum for @xmath72 .",
    "thus , solutions exists only for accretion rates larger that a critical value , @xmath73\\equiv \\dot m ( r , f_{\\rm cr})$ ] .",
    "this corresponds to a critical value , @xmath74 , of the fraction of power vertically transported by poynting flux . for @xmath75 two radiation pressure dominated solutions",
    "are found for each set of parameters , one with @xmath76 and the other with @xmath77 ( see fig .  [ fig_highalpha ] ) .",
    "the first is a `` standard '' ( unstable ) one , characterized by a low value of the fraction of power transported vertically by poynting flux , and is just the continuation of the radiation pressure dominated branch discussed in the previous section at high values of @xmath31 .",
    "the second one , which is discussed here for the first time , appears due to the feedback effect of the closure relation ( [ eq_f ] ) .",
    "it is a ( mildly ) radiation pressure dominated solution endowed with a powerful corona , in that @xmath78 as the accretion rate increases .    the values of @xmath79 and @xmath74 can be found by solving @xmath80 , or , equivalently , the equation @xmath81 . for every @xmath58 ,",
    "re obtain @xmath82 for @xmath83 , quickly converging towards @xmath84 for increasing @xmath31 . the critical accretion rate ,",
    "though , depends on @xmath58 .",
    "the lowest possible value of the critical accretion rate , that can be simply denoted @xmath85 , appears at @xmath86 ( which is the radius where the function @xmath87 has a minimum ) .",
    "we have numerically computed @xmath85 as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "the relation can be approximated by the analytic expression @xmath89 which is accurate to better than 3% for @xmath90 and to better than 10% for @xmath91 .",
    "the above formula also makes manifest the main differences that would be found if we chose supermassive black holes instead that stellar mass ones .",
    "namely , the critical accretion rate separating gas from radiation pressure dominated solutions and that determining the existence of our new high viscosity , high-@xmath1 solution would be reduced by a factor @xmath92 .",
    "the qualitative properties of the solutions would be left unchanged .",
    "[ fig_highalpha ] shows , for @xmath64 and @xmath93 , the radial dependence of the coronal fraction for different values of the accretion rate .",
    "the two solutions appear for @xmath94 and show an opposite trend as the accretion rate increases : while in the first case @xmath1 decreases and the disc becomes less dense and more radiation pressure dominated , in the second case @xmath1 increases , the disc becomes denser and less radiation pressure dominated .",
    "it is worth studying the stability property of this newly discovered solution .",
    "thermal stability requires @xcite @xmath95 we have @xmath96 and , from ( [ eq_rad ] ) , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the stability criterion becomes : @xmath98 because the numerator of the second term is always positive for @xmath99 , we have that for @xmath77 ( which is a pole for the second term in the above equation ) indeed the criterion is satisfied , while the opposite is true for @xmath76 . on the other hand , viscous stability requires that @xmath100 .",
    "we have @xmath101 , and the stability condition can be written as @xmath102 which is satisfied when thermal stability condition is also satisfied .",
    "the very important fact that our new discovered high-@xmath1 solutions are both viscously and thermally stable may be an indication that , whenever allowed to do so , the system will chose those solutions over the low-@xmath1 ones .",
    "the real physical state of a high viscosity disc at high accretion rates , though , is likely more complicated and inherently time dependent .",
    "indeed , the very fact that for @xmath103 no gas pressure dominated solutions exist , make us believe that in the outer part of the disc magnetic turbulence will self - regulate to keep the viscosity parameter below its critical value .",
    "thus , the value of the viscosity parameter may not be constant throughout the disc , but more likely increases inwards , as also suggested by high - resolution numerical mhd simulations of the inner parts of non radiative discs @xcite .",
    "for any given radial profile of the viscosity parameter @xmath31 , the radius at which it reaches its critical value will therefore play an important role in determining the physical properties of the disc .",
    "we may speculate that in a full time dependent solution both the viscosity parameter and the local accretion rate will adjust in order to avoid discontinuities in the flow there , but the exact nature of the final disc structure is impossible to predict from our stationary solutions .",
    "beside the thin disc approximation , which is straightforward to verify _ a posteriori _ for all our solutions but the low-@xmath1 , high-@xmath104 ones ( as in the standard ss case ) , our results are rooted in two further assumptions .",
    "the first is that the growth rate of mri is given by ( [ eq_bs01 ] ) in radiation pressure dominated discs , the second is that buoyancy is the main mechanism of field saturation in turbulent magnetized discs .",
    "let us examine these two issues one at a time .    as discussed in blaes & socrates ( 2001 ) , the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ eq_bs01 ] ) depends on the capability of radiative diffusion to destroy radiation sound waves on the length scale of the mri , and requires that the azimuthal magnetic field component dominates the vertical one , as should be the case in thin discs with keplerian velocity profiles ( see also the numerical simulations of initially random fields in hawley , gammie & balbus 1996 ) .",
    "let us define the alfvn speed associated to the vertical field component , @xmath105 , and the ( small ) parameter @xmath106 .",
    "the diffusion wavenumber for keplerian discs is @xcite : @xmath107    then , eq .",
    "( [ eq_bs01 ] ) should be valid if the characteristic wavenumber of the instability , @xmath108 is of the order of ( or larger than ) the diffusion wavenumber @xmath109 . by using the expression ( [ eq_rad ] ) for the density , ( [ eq_f ] ) , and the definition of @xmath110 , we obtain the following condition for the validity of our assumption :    @xmath111    noting that @xmath112 \\simeq 0.2 $ ] , this translates into . ]",
    "@xmath113 which is always satisfied for the low-@xmath1 radiation pressure dominated solutions , while , for the @xmath2 solutions , it breaks down for very high accretion rates @xmath114 .",
    "it is clear that in order for our viscosity scaling ( [ eq_visc ] ) to be applicable to the high-@xmath1 solutions at super - eddington rates , higher azimuthal field strengths ( and low @xmath115 ) are required .",
    "however , if @xmath57 grows too large , and eq .",
    "( [ cond_diff ] ) is not satisfied , then the magnetic stresses , and the magnetic pressure , will be proportional to the total pressure .",
    "the condition of subsonic turbulence would then imply again @xmath70 .",
    "the fraction of power transported vertically by poynting flux , @xmath1 will tend again to its maximum value @xmath116 , as in the gas - pressure dominated solutions .",
    "therefore , it seems plausible to envisage that the high-@xmath1 solutions could extend to arbitrarily large accretion rates , regardless to the viscosity law and the detailed properties of the mri field , as long as @xmath31 is sufficiently high in these regimes .",
    "the second main assumption that was used in the derivation of our solutions was to consider buoyancy the main mechanism by which the disc gets rid of the magnetic field .",
    "in fact , two other competing mechanisms should be considered : turbulent diffusion and dissipation .",
    "let us first compare the typical buoyancy timescale ( @xmath117 ) with the turbulent diffusion one ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the kinematic viscosity coefficient @xmath119 can be recovered from the standard viscous form of the stress to obtain @xmath120 .",
    "we then have @xmath121 therefore , for any physical self - consistent , @xmath69 solution , buoyancy is always a more efficient mechanism of field escape than field diffusion , unless @xmath122 is substantially larger than unity ..    on the other hand ,",
    "the field may dissipate by cascading down the subsonic turbulence and leave its energy inside the disc .",
    "the typical timescale for this process is set by the coherence time of the turbulent flow , that we have assumed to be @xmath123 .",
    "this would give @xmath124 which implies that our working assumption is justified only for large viscosity solutions .",
    "in practice , if @xmath31 is small , the actual maximal fraction of power dissipated into the corona will be further reduced by a factor @xmath125 .",
    "however , the high viscosity , high-@xmath1 solutions discussed in section 3.2 will be little affected by dissipational losses of energy inside the disc .",
    "we have presented a full analysis of thin accretion disc solutions under the assumptions that the magnetic field generated and amplified by mri ( which is at the origin of mhd turbulent stress in the disc ) saturates mainly due to buoyant transport in the vertical direction . from these assumptions ,",
    "a viscosity prescription is derived , in which magnetic pressure , and therefore turbulent stresses , scale proportionally to the geometric mean of gas and total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure .",
    "this prescription , in turn , allows us to uniquely determine , for every set of the parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath31 ) the fraction of the accretion power @xmath1 which is transported vertically by poynting flux . for low values of the viscosity parameter",
    "the solution is unique , with @xmath1 tending to its maximum value , @xmath63 , when gas pressure dominates ( low accretion rates ) , and decreasing as the accretion rate increases and radiation pressure becomes more and more important . for @xmath126",
    "there are no solutions for gas pressure dominated regions , while in the radiation dominated part of the flow two solutions are possible for every value of the accretion rate .",
    "the first is a `` standard '' ( unstable ) one , with @xmath127 , while the second has @xmath78 ( corona dominated ) as the accretion rate increases and is thermally and viscously stable .",
    "two main results from the present study are important for the interpretation of observed spectral energy distributions of accretion - powered systems .",
    "the first is the property of low-@xmath31 solutions to be more corona - dominated ( i.e. to have the largest possible value of @xmath1 ) at low accretion rates .",
    "this has been discussed in merloni & fabian ( 2002a ) in the context of low - luminosity black hole .",
    "it is indeed an observational fact that the relative strength of the hard , optically thin , power - law - like component in their x - ray spectra increases with respect to the optically thick , quasi - thermal one as @xmath57 decreases .",
    "the second is the existence of a new high-@xmath1 solution at high accretion rates for high values of the viscosity parameter .    as in the case of corona - dominated solutions at low @xmath57 ,",
    "it is plausible to speculate that the large poynting fluxes in the vertical direction that characterize these solutions are to be associated with the generation of powerful coronae and , possibly , powerful outflows / jets , too @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are observational hints that black holes believed to accrete at eddington or super - eddington rates bear many similarities with their low - rate counterparts",
    ". this class of objects may include galactic black holes in the _ very high _ state ( see done 2002 , and references therein ) , whose x - ray spectra show a power - law component , likely of non - thermal origin @xcite , often as strong as the quasi - thermal one ; broad line radio galaxies , where the weakness of x - ray reflection features has been interpreted as evidence for highly ionized discs surrounded by powerful coronae at high accretion rates @xcite ; powerful blazars , where it has been shown @xcite how the relativistic jet in these sources may dominate the total output power at very high ( inferred ) @xmath57 . furthermore , some ultra luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ; makishima et al .",
    "2000 ) have shown power - law like spectra , analogous to those of black hole candidates in their very high state , at inferred accretion rates of a few times the eddington rate for a 30@xmath128 black hole @xcite .    in order to assess the relevance of our new solution in all the above cases ,",
    "vertically integrated models should be abandoned , and the complicated problem of determining the disc structure in the vertical direction , together with the disc  corona boundary , tackled . this would allow us to establish the relationships between the ( vertically integrated ) parameter @xmath1 , and the observationally determined fraction of power dissipated in the corona . in particular",
    ", it is only by carefully studying the disc  corona transition region that will be possible to assess how super - eddington ( if at all ) our new high @xmath31 solutions can be . in principle , if a high fraction of accretion power could be dissipated in the corona without disrupting the optically thick disc , there would be no limitation to the total luminosity that the source could emit , because the radiation is shining on the disc from outside .",
    "such a possibility to obtain super - eddington luminosities is physically different from the one recently proposed by begelman ( 2001 ; 2002 ) , although both depend on the existence of magnetized radiation pressure dominated thin discs .",
    "in fact , the non - linear analysis of gammie ( 1998 ) and blaes & socrates ( 2001 ) photon bubble instability carried on in begelman ( 2001 ) is applicable to the low-@xmath1 radiation dominated solutions we have presented here , which is much more strongly radiation pressure dominated than the high-@xmath1 ones , while the thinner discs of the high-@xmath1 solutions have almost equal radiation and gas pressures , and therefore should not be too strongly inhomogenous .",
    "finally , we point out that the existence of multiple solutions for the same set of parameters ( high @xmath31 case ) , may give rise to interesting hysteresis effects during spectral transition caused by long term variation of the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "a full time - dependent analysis of our solution is needed in order to make definite predictions in this sense .",
