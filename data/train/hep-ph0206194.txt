    "the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking remains a mystery , despite decades of theoretical and experimental study . in the standard model ,",
    "the masses for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bosons , quarks and charged leptons are all generated by the higgs mechanism .",
    "this mechanism leaves as its residue the higgs boson , the one undetected elementary particle of the standard model , and the only scalar  @xcite .",
    "its properties are completely specified once its mass is determined .",
    "alternatives to , or extensions of , the standard model electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism typically also include one or more higgs particles .",
    "experiments over the next decade at the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) should shed considerable light on electroweak symmetry breaking , in particular by searching for these higgs bosons , and measuring their masses , production cross sections , and branching ratios .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that at least one higgs particle will be fairly light .",
    "the standard model higgs boson mass is bounded from above by precision electroweak measurements , @xmath5@xmath6 gev at 95% cl  @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "the lightest higgs boson is predicted to have a mass below about 135 gev  @xcite ; over much of the parameter space it has properties reasonably similar to the standard model higgs boson .",
    "there are also hints of a signal in the direct search in @xmath7 at lep2 , just beyond the lower mass limit of 114.1  gev  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding lower limit on the lightest scalar in the mssm is only 91.0  gev  @xcite , because the @xmath8 coupling can be suppressed in some regions of parameter space .    run ii of the tevatron can exclude standard model higgs masses up to @xmath9  gev with 15  fb@xmath10 per experiment .",
    "however , at this integrated luminosity a 5@xmath11 discovery will be difficult to obtain  @xcite for a mass much beyond the lep2 limit . also , the higgs decay modes relevant for searches at the tevatron , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , do not lend themselves to a precise measurement of the higgs mass",
    ". the lhc will completely cover the low mass region preferred by precision electroweak fits and the mssm , as well as much higher masses .",
    "for @xmath14 gev , the most important mode involves production via gluon fusion , @xmath15 , followed by the rare decay into two photons , @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "although this mode has a very large continuum @xmath2 background  @xcite , the narrow width of the higgs boson , combined with the mass resolution of order 1% achievable in the lhc detectors , allows one to measure the background experimentally and subtract it from a putative signal peak  @xcite .    for the same mass range of @xmath14 gev at the lhc , higgs production via weak boson fusion , @xmath17 , followed by ( virtual ) weak boson decay ,",
    "@xmath18 , is also promising , even for higgs masses as low as the lep2 limit  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a mass determination from this mode , or from weak boson fusion followed by @xmath19  @xcite , can not compete with the @xmath2 mode , although these modes certainly offer very useful branching ratio information .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an improved calculation of the prompt ( _ i.e. _ not from hadron decay ) di - photon background to higgs production at the lhc , in particular by computing qcd corrections to the gluon fusion subprocess .",
    "although the background will be measured at the lhc , it is still useful to have a robust theoretical prediction in order to help validate the quantitative understanding of detector performance . perhaps more importantly",
    ", the theoretical prediction can be used to systematically study the dependence of the signal relative to the background on various kinematic cuts , providing information which can be used to optimize higgs search strategies . as a side benefit",
    ", one can improve the predictions for a variety of di - photon distributions that can be measured .",
    "the process @xmath20 proceeds at lowest order via the quark annihilation subprocess @xmath21 , which is independent of the strong coupling @xmath22 . the next - to - leading - order ( nlo )",
    "corrections to this subprocess have been incorporated into a number of monte carlo programs  @xcite .",
    "however , the gluon distribution in the proton becomes very large at small @xmath23 , making formally higher order corrections involving gluon initial states very significant for the production of low - mass systems at the lhc .",
    "gluons can fuse to photon pairs through one - loop quark box diagrams such as the one shown in ( a ) .",
    "the order @xmath24 contribution to @xmath20 from @xmath25 is indeed comparable to the leading - order quark annihilation contribution  @xcite .",
    "( in fact , the nlo correction to quark annihilation , including the @xmath26 amplitude , can also be as large as either of these terms . ) hence , to reduce the uncertainty on the total @xmath2 production rate , we have computed the contributions of the @xmath25 subprocess at _ its _ next - to - leading - order , which we shall call `` nlo '' , even though it is formally n@xmath27lo as far as the whole process @xmath20 is concerned .",
    "the nlo gluon fusion computation has two matrix - element ingredients :    * the virtual corrections to @xmath28 , involving two - loop diagrams such as the one in ( b ) , which were computed recently  @xcite using the integration methods developed in refs .",
    "the effects of gluon bremsstrahlung , through the one - loop amplitude for @xmath29 , including pentagon diagrams as depicted in ( c ) . the @xmath29 amplitude can be obtained from the one - loop five - gluon matrix elements  @xcite by summing over permutations of the external legs  @xcite .",
    "both the virtual and real corrections have been evaluated in the limit of vanishing quark masses . in the range of di - photon invariant masses relevant for the standard model and mssm higgs searches , 90150 gev ,",
    "this is an excellent approximation .",
    "the masses of the five light quarks are all much less than the scale of the process .",
    "the top quark contribution is negligible until the invariant mass approaches @xmath30 gev ; at 150 gev , it is still well under one percent of the total quark loop contribution .",
    "the virtual and real corrections are separately infrared divergent .",
    "we have used the dipole formalism  @xcite to combine them into a finite result , in a numerical program that can compute general kinematic distributions .",
    "prompt photons are not only produced directly in hard processes , but also _ via _ fragmentation from quarks and gluons .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , even though the separation into direct and fragmentation contributions is somewhat arbitrary , it is still very useful to track the pieces separately .",
    "the fragmentation processes occur at low @xmath31 with respect to a neighboring jet .",
    "they can only be computed with the aid of nonperturbative information , in the form of the quark and gluon fragmentation functions to a photon , @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the fractional collinear momentum carried by the photon , measured relative to the momentum of the parton which fragments into it , and @xmath34 is the factorization scale used to separate the hard and soft processes . the _ inclusive _ di - photon production rate at the lhc is actually dominated by the single fragmentation process , _",
    "e.g. _ the partonic subprocess @xmath35 , followed by the fragmentation @xmath36 . even the double fragmentation process , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath37 followed by the fragmentations @xmath36 and @xmath38 , can exceed the direct contribution in the 80140  gev range for @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "however , fragmentation contributions can be efficiently suppressed by photon isolation cuts  @xcite .",
    "such cuts are mandatory in order to suppress the very large reducible experimental background where photons are faked by jets , or more generally by hadrons . in particular , @xmath40s at large @xmath31 decay into two nearly collinear photons , which can be difficult to distinguish from a single photon .",
    "the standard method for defining an isolated photon is to first draw a circle of radius @xmath41 in the plane of pseudorapidity , @xmath42 , and azimuthal angle , @xmath43 , centered on the photon candidate .",
    "the amount of transverse hadronic energy in this circle , or cone , is required to be less than some specified amount , @xmath44 . here",
    ", @xmath41 and @xmath44 may in principle be varied independently .",
    "although photon isolation is improved by increasing @xmath41 and decreasing @xmath44 , this can not be done indefinitely , for both theoretical and experimental reasons . theoretically , it is not infrared - safe to forbid all gluon radiation in a finite patch of phase space , so any prediction would have large uncontrolled corrections .",
    "experimentally , fluctuations in the number of soft hadrons from the hard scattering , the underlying event , and other minimum bias events in the same bunch crossing , plus detector noise , impose a lower limit on the @xmath44 that can be required for isolation , at a given @xmath41 .",
    "a typical choice of isolation criteria in past lhc studies has been @xmath45 and @xmath46 or 15 gev  @xcite .",
    "the experimental optimization of these variables has often been made with the suppression of the huge reducible background from jet fakes as a primary criterion  @xcite .",
    "this criterion is very understandable in the light of how poorly this background is understood ; it depends on the tails of distributions , such as the very hard ( @xmath47 ) tail of parton fragmentation to @xmath40s  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is estimated that this background can be reduced to the order of 1020% of the irreducible @xmath2 background , so that one should try to optimize with respect to the latter background as well .",
    "we shall investigate the behavior of the irreducible @xmath2 background , as well as the higgs signal , as the cone size @xmath41 is increased , while also increasing the transverse energy allowed into the cone .",
    "an alternative `` smooth '' cone isolation criterion has been proposed by frixione  @xcite , in which a continuous set of cones with @xmath48 are defined , and the transverse energy permitted inside @xmath49 , @xmath50 , decreases to zero as @xmath49 does .",
    "this criterion has the theoretical advantage that it entirely suppresses the more poorly known fragmentation contribution , while still being infrared safe .",
    "experimentally , however , this theoretical ideal may be difficult to achieve with a detector of finite granularity , and taking into account the transverse extent of the photon s electromagnetic shower  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we shall study the behavior of higgs signal and background for a few versions of the smooth cone criterion as well .",
    "the fragmentation contributions are technically involved to compute at nlo .",
    "their implementation requires , for example , all the one - loop four - parton matrix elements and tree - level five - parton matrix elements , as well as convolution with fragmentation functions .",
    "fortunately , a flexible program is available , diphox  @xcite , which incorporates at nlo the quark annihilation direct subprocess , plus single and double fragmentation .",
    "it also contains the gluon fusion subprocess at leading order .",
    "we have used diphox to produce all the non - gluon fusion contributions to @xmath51 for the case of standard cone isolation .",
    "these were then combined with the results of our nlo implementation of gluon fusion .",
    "( we have also checked the diphox implementation of the leading order gluon fusion contribution against ours , and they agree perfectly . ) for the case of smooth cone isolation , where fragmentation contributions are absent , we have implemented the @xmath21 direct subprocess at nlo ourselves , as well as the gluon fusion subprocess .        since we are computing only a selection of the contributions to @xmath51 at order @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we should make a few remarks about contributions we have omitted , at least those appearing at order @xmath52 .",
    "indicates a few such contributions .",
    "perhaps most worrisome at first glance is the tree - level cross section for @xmath54 , as shown in ( a ) .",
    "this subprocess can utilize the large gluon - gluon luminosity , is only of order @xmath52 , and has not yet been computed to our knowledge . in addition , it can be enhanced by @xmath55 collinear singularities if the isolation cut is not too severe .",
    "it has a double collinear singularity related to the @xmath56 splitting process , so that this contribution should depend on the factorization scale through terms proportional to @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "although this contribution alone does not cancel the full dependence on @xmath34 to order @xmath52 , it does cancel the terms in @xmath59 that are enhanced by two factors of the gluon density and are potentially the largest .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider the @xmath60 contributions as a first approximation to the full nnlo calculation .",
    "a study of the similar subprocesses , @xmath61 where @xmath62 or @xmath4 , was recently carried out , with the conclusion that their effects are actually quite small , 5% or less ( and negative ) , with respect to the lower - order contributions of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 initial states  @xcite . assuming that these results also hold for the @xmath2 final state",
    ", our neglect of @xmath54 should be tolerable .",
    "other order @xmath52 corrections to the quark annihilation subprocess include the two - loop virtual corrections shown in ( b ) , which also have been computed recently  @xcite , and real corrections , such as from @xmath65 in ( c ) .",
    "the numerical implementation of these corrections involve doubly unresolved parton configurations and remain to be performed . because the @xmath26 amplitude provides such a large nlo correction to the quark annihilation subprocess , the order @xmath24 contributions arising from the @xmath64 initial state could be reasonably important .",
    "the @xmath64 initial - state contributions may be more tractable than the full order @xmath52 corrections to the quark annihilation subprocess , because of fewer soft gluon singularities .",
    "there are actually three other ways for the quark box responsible for @xmath28 to contribute to the @xmath51 cross section at order @xmath24 .",
    "the quark box can be incorporated into the one - loop @xmath66 amplitude shown in ( d ) , which can then interfere with the tree - level @xmath66 amplitude .",
    "however , such a contribution only gets to utilize one gluon distribution function at small @xmath23 , not two .",
    "it is likely to be smaller than the other order @xmath52 @xmath64 initial - state contributions just mentioned , given that it lacks both initial- and final - state singularities .",
    "( the loop and tree amplitudes each have square - root collinear singularities , but they appear in different collinear limits , so that the phase space integral of the amplitude product remains finite . ) the quark box contribution to the crossed process @xmath67 is also infrared finite , and lacks any small @xmath23 gluon enhancement , so it should be even smaller than the @xmath66 case .",
    "finally , there is a two - loop virtual correction to @xmath21 containing the quark box ( not shown here ) , which can interfere with the tree amplitude at order @xmath24 .",
    "this particular correction is also infrared finite , and does not benefit from any small @xmath23 gluon distribution .",
    "numerical evaluation of the expression in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that its magnitude never exceeds 0.3% of the born quark annihilation cross section ( its sign is negative for all relevant , central scattering angles ) , so we are justified in neglecting it .    in this paper",
    "we also investigate the effects of isolation cuts and other kinematic features of the higgs signal _ vs. _ the qcd background .",
    "intuitively , one might expect the irreducible background to diminish more rapidly than the signal as one imposes more severe photon isolation requirements for the following reason : the largest component of the irreducible background , for typical isolation cuts , comes from the subprocess @xmath66 , even after we include the nlo corrections to gluon fusion .",
    "the @xmath64-initiated subprocess has final - state singularities when the quark is collinear with either of the photons , which of course require some kind of photon isolation to make finite .",
    "thus , the contribution of this subprocess can be significantly reduced with tighter isolation cuts . on the other hand , the dominant higgs production process , @xmath68 , even at higher orders where",
    "additional partons are radiated , clearly does not give rise to partons that are preferentially near the photons .",
    "there are at least two different ways to make the photon isolation more severe .",
    "one way is to strengthen the isolation cone , for example by increasing its radius @xmath41 .",
    "a second approach is to impose a jet veto  @xcite in the neighborhood of the photon candidate , on top of a `` standard '' isolation requirement .",
    "for example , one may forbid events having a jet with @xmath69 whose axis is within a distance @xmath70 in @xmath71 space from either photon candidate , where @xmath72 .",
    "the two approaches are depicted in .",
    "the small inner cone corresponds to a standard photon isolation cone , _",
    "e.g. _ with radius @xmath45 .",
    "the outer cone could correspond to a larger isolation cone , _",
    "e.g. _ with radius @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "alternatively , it could represent the radius @xmath70 within which jets , such as the one depicted , are vetoed against .    at the level of a nlo parton calculation , the jet veto approach is not too different from the large cone approach , if one chooses @xmath70 and @xmath75 to be equal to the large cone values of @xmath41 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the reason is that for the direct contributions the hadronic energy is deposited as a single parton .",
    "however , the jet veto approach is probably preferable for experimental reasons .",
    "the hadronic energy represented by the final state quark in the background process @xmath66 should typically be deposited in the form of a jet .",
    "in contrast , an equivalent amount of energy originating from either soft hadrons from overlapping events , or detector noise , will usually be uniformly distributed in @xmath71 , and so will be less likely to form a jet .",
    "thus when a signal event is accompanied by such energy , it is less likely to be discarded in the case of a jet veto , compared with the case of a standard or smooth isolation cone of large size .",
    "illustration of two possible ways to strengthen photon isolation , beyond the `` standard '' isolation represented by the inner cone .",
    "one can either increase the cone radius to the large outer one shown , or one can veto on jets within such a radius . ]",
    "another feature distinguishing the two photons from higgs decay from those produced directly is their angular distribution .",
    "the @xmath63- and @xmath64-initiated components of the background have @xmath76-channel fermion exchanges that tend to yield photons toward smaller scattering angles in the @xmath2 center - of - mass ( for a fixed @xmath39 ) , compared with the decay of the higgs boson , which is isotropic in @xmath77 .",
    "hence , we will study signal and background distributions in @xmath78 , where the @xmath79 are the rapidities of the photons .",
    "this variable serves as a proxy for @xmath77 , because @xmath80 at lowest order .",
    "the remaining variable which describes the higgs boson kinematics at lo is the rapidity of the higgs boson itself .",
    "this leads us to consider the signal and background distributions of @xmath81 , the rapidity of the total di - photon system .",
    "to a large extent this distribution is determined by the parton luminosities which are involved in the production process . since higgs production",
    "is dominated by gluon - gluon fusion , whereas the direct @xmath82 background gets comparable contributions from all three initial states , @xmath83 , @xmath64 , and @xmath84 , there may be a useful difference in the @xmath85 distribution .    to carry out these studies of the signal as well ,",
    "we have implemented the gluon fusion production of the standard model higgs boson at nlo , followed by decay to @xmath2 .",
    "we work in the heavy top quark limit , for which an effective @xmath86 vertex  @xcite suffices to describe the production process at the low higgs transverse momenta we consider .",
    "( we do , however , include the exact @xmath87 dependence of the lo term .",
    "this has been shown  @xcite to be an excellent approximation to the exact nlo cross section  @xcite for the higgs masses with which we are concerned . )",
    "the total higgs production cross section has recently become available in this limit at nnlo  @xcite .",
    "the corrections from nlo to nnlo are modest . here",
    "we wish to study distributions with kinematical cuts , which have not yet been computed at nnlo . for cuts that select events with nonzero transverse momentum of the higgs boson ( which we do not explicitly consider in this paper ) ,",
    "our calculation is only a lo computation ; distributions for such quantities at nlo are available elsewhere  @xcite . for the branching ratio",
    "@xmath88 we use the program hdecay  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ computationsection ]",
    "we outline the nlo gluon fusion computation . in section  [ numericssection ]",
    "we show the effects of the nlo corrections to @xmath28 on the total @xmath51 cross section , using kinematic cuts appropriate to the higgs search , and concentrating on the comparison with lo and on the scale dependence . in section  [ statisticssection ]",
    "we study the effects of varying the photon isolation criteria , either by increasing the size of the isolation cone , or by imposing a veto on nearby jets .",
    "we also compute the distributions in @xmath89 and @xmath85 , and investigate how they may be used to help distinguish the higgs signal from the background .",
    "in section  [ conclusionsection ] we present our conclusions , and the outlook for further improvement of our understanding of the @xmath2 background .",
    "the gluon fusion subprocess begins at one loop .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections to it include two - loop four - point amplitudes and one - loop five - point amplitudes .",
    "the calculation of these matrix elements requires a fair amount of work  @xcite .",
    "however , once the amplitudes are available , the rest of the nlo gluon fusion computation is in all essential respects identical to a conventional nlo computation involving tree - level and one - loop amplitudes .",
    "for example , the two - loop amplitudes for @xmath28 have virtual infrared divergences with the same structure as those of a typical one - loop amplitude .",
    "similarly , the vanishing of the @xmath28 tree amplitude causes the singular behavior of the @xmath29 one - loop amplitude , as the outgoing gluon becomes soft or collinear with an incoming gluon , to have the same form as that of a typical tree amplitude with one additional radiated gluon .",
    "the one - loop gluon fusion helicity amplitudes for the process @xmath90 in an `` all - outgoing '' labelling convention for the momenta @xmath91 and helicities @xmath92 , are given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the qed coupling at zero momentum transfer , @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the running qcd coupling in @xmath97 scheme , evaluated at renormalization scale @xmath98 . also , in this formula , @xmath99 are the adjoint gluon color indices , @xmath100 are the quark charges in units of @xmath101 , the appropriate number of light flavors is @xmath102 , and we have suppressed overall phases in the amplitudes .",

    "\\label{tildekdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the third term contains the @xmath141 squared matrix element  ( [ gggamgamgsum ] ) , minus the two dipole subtractions mentioned above , @xmath158d\\gamma_3 , \\label{dipolesubtracted}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 is the three - particle lorentz - invariant phase space .",
    "thus it involves the full five - point kinematics .",
    "we have implemented these three terms in a numerical program that allows for different kinematic cuts and photon isolation criteria to be applied .",
    "the numerical integrals are performed by adaptive monte carlo sampling using vegas  @xcite .",
    "for the first and second terms the monte carlo routine is used to generate the photon four - momenta with four - point kinematics , along with the appropriate longitudinal boosts of . for the third term the events",
    "are generated with five - point kinematics ; however , treatment of the final - state particles differs for the @xmath160 squared matrix element   and the two dipole subtractions . whereas the @xmath141 squared matrix element is treated as a true three - parton final - state , the dipole subtraction for gluon 1 is treated as a two - parton final - state with the photon momenta given by , and similarly for the dipole subtraction for gluon 2",
    "thus , each call to vegas in the third term produces three distinct kinematic configurations with three different weights .",
    "the infrared safety of the kinematic and isolation cuts ensures the appropriate cancellation between the pieces as the gluon becomes soft or collinear .",
    "in this section we present the modifications to the @xmath161 cross section due to the inclusion of the nlo contributions to the gluon fusion subprocess .      we impose the following kinematic cuts on the two photons , @xmath162 which are essentially those used by the atlas and cms detectors in their higgs search studies  @xcite . in addition",
    ", we require each photon to be isolated from hadronic energy , according to one of two criteria :    1 .   _ standard _ cone isolation  the amount of transverse hadronic energy @xmath163 in a cone of radius @xmath164 must be less than @xmath44 .",
    "smooth _ cone isolation  @xcite  the amount of transverse hadronic energy @xmath163 in _ all _ cones of radius @xmath49 with @xmath165 must be less than @xmath166 here we shall choose @xmath167 .",
    "note that in an nlo calculation , `` hadronic energy '' in the neighborhood of the photon always amounts to just a single parton , a rather crude approximation to the true hadronic background .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we evaluate the nlo cross sections with the mrst99 set 2 parton distributions  @xcite , with the corresponding value of @xmath168 . for comparison purposes , we also present cross sections for the leading - order gluon fusion subprocess , convoluted with the nlo parton distributions mrst99 set 2 .",
    "we use nlo instead of lo parton distributions here , because that approach was taken in the most complete previous study  @xcite , and we wish to highlight differences with respect to that work .",
    "the use of nlo parton distributions can also be justified by considering the `` lo '' gluon fusion subprocess as a nnlo correction to the entire @xmath2 production process .",
    "our default choices for the renormalization and factorization scales are @xmath169 as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we also investigate the dependence of the results on @xmath98 and @xmath34 . for the fragmentation contributions",
    "@xcite , we rely on the nlo set i photon fragmentation functions from ref .  @xcite .",
    "\\(a ) shows the contribution of just the gluon fusion subprocess to @xmath51 at the lhc , at its leading and next - to - leading orders , for the standard cone photon isolation criterion with @xmath45 , @xmath170  gev , and for several choices of parton distributions . to help with comparisons to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we use mrst99 set 2 as our `` default '' choice .",
    "this set has a somewhat larger gluon distribution at large @xmath23 than mrst99 set 1 , but the differences with this set , or with cteq5m1  @xcite , at the smaller @xmath23 ranges probed here are small compared to the nlo corrections , or to the renormalization and factorization scale dependence , as we shall see .",
    "we also plot the lo cross section with the lo cteq5l distributions ( using a lo @xmath171 )  @xcite , in order to compare our nlo cross section with a `` true '' lo calculation .",
    "recently , the more precise hera data has been incorporated into two updated standard sets of distributions , mrst2001  @xcite and cteq6 m  @xcite . however , neither set has a sizable change from its predecessor in the quark and gluon distributions for @xmath23 in the relevant range 0.010.1 at @xmath172  gev@xmath173 .",
    "the new mrst2001 distribution uses a slightly larger @xmath174 , which may increase the importance of the gluon fusion subprocess relative to the @xmath175 subprocess by a few percent , but overall the effect on the @xmath2 background should be fairly small",
    ".    .[ktable ] nlo qcd @xmath176 factors for @xmath2 higgs signal and gluon fusion background . both lo and nlo cross sections",
    "are computed using nlo parton distributions . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the smallest cone size , @xmath45 , used in tables  [ sbstandardtable ] and  [ sbsmoothtable ] , is the standard cone size used in previous studies .",
    "recently it was observed  @xcite that logarithms of the form @xmath177",
    "@xcite can invalidate an nlo calculation of prompt photon production : for @xmath178 the nlo single - photon cross section with isolation was larger than the cross section with no isolation , which is clearly an unphysical result .",
    "it is not yet known precisely how small @xmath41 can be taken before the nlo calculation begins to break down . however , for @xmath45 , the @xmath179 factor is 2.5 times smaller than it is for the pathological case of @xmath178 . also , the physical scale in the di - photon invariant masses relevant for the lhc higgs search is significantly higher than the single - photon @xmath180 gev case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , rendering @xmath181 smaller as well .",
    "finally , we note that the large logarithms do not arise from the gluon fusion contributions , because there is no @xmath182 collinear singularity .",
    "hence the effect of the logarithms in the single - photon case ( where gluon fusion is not important and was not included ) is diluted somewhat in the di - photon case by the gluon fusion contribution .",
    "nevertheless , further study of this situation , including possibly resummation of the logarithms , could be helpful .",
    "a more critical issue for this analysis is that the most severe isolation parameters may not be phenomenologically viable , for both the theoretical and experimental reasons mentioned in the introduction . theoretically , it is not infrared safe to forbid all gluon radiation into any finite region of phase space . if the isolation criteria approach this limit , the perturbative predictions become subject to large corrections and therefore become unreliable  @xcite .",
    "after all , two @xmath74 cones can cover most of the @xmath71 plane within the detector acceptance , and @xmath183 gev is not a lot of energy at the lhc . on the experimental side ,",
    "the efficiency for collecting signal events may decline for reasons that are absent from the nlo monte carlo .",
    "instrumental ( calorimeter ) noise , pile up , and energy deposition from the underlying event plus overlapping minimum bias collisions , all contribute an average energy in a cone which scales roughly as the area of the cone .",
    "thus one might expect that when @xmath41 is increased , one should also increase @xmath44 , roughly like @xmath184 . for the @xmath45 cone typically used , pile up and underlying events start to saturate the cone at @xmath185 gev  @xcite . for @xmath74 ,",
    "saturation would most likely be occurring at @xmath170 gev , perhaps even at 30 gev .",
    "another potential problem is that as one varies the cuts to reduce the irreducible contributions , one must be sure that the reducible contributions do not get larger , undoing the improvement .",
    "for example , we have raised the total transverse energy allowed near the photon , in going from @xmath45 , @xmath183 gev to , say , @xmath74 , @xmath186 gev , and this may allow more of the reducible background to enter .",
    "this question could be addressed by studies along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite . in any case , it is clear that a phenomenologically more sensible method for rejecting events with hadronic energy near the photons is required .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a veto on nearby jets offers another way to suppress the qcd background , in particular the @xmath66 process  @xcite . at the nlo parton level , at least for direct processes , it corresponds closely to increasing the size of the cone .",
    "however , because transverse energy is being forbidden into a smaller area ( the jet cone size ) , for the same amount of suppression at nlo , the jet veto is a more infrared safe criterion , and it should also have better experimental properties ( less loss of signal due to noise , overlapping events , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "jet vetoes have been considered previously in search strategies for other higgs decay modes , particularly @xmath187  @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "typically a general veto is applied on all jets in the detector acceptance with @xmath188 above a certain value . for the @xmath2 mode",
    ", we would only like to veto on jets `` close '' to the photon candidates .",
    "such nearby jets are more likely to come from the @xmath189 subprocess , because of the final state @xmath190 collinear singularity , than from the higgs production process @xmath68 . on the other hand , because the gluon is in a larger color representation than the quark , @xmath84-initiated production of a color singlet object tends to be jettier overall than production initiated by @xmath175 or @xmath64 initial states .",
    "in fact , cuts requiring a minimum transverse momentum of the @xmath2 pair , @xmath191 gev , have been proposed to take advantage of this fact  @xcite , and enhance the signal .",
    "so only jets `` sufficiently '' near a photon candidate should be vetoed .",
    "effect on the background process @xmath20 of vetoing on jets with @xmath192 gev within @xmath193 of either photon candidate .",
    "the veto is on top of standard cone isolation with @xmath45 , @xmath46  gev .",
    "mrst99 set 2 partons are used , with the default acceptance cuts  ( [ acccuts ] ) and scale choice  ( [ defaultmu]).,width=326 ]    we implement the jet veto on top of a standard photon isolation cone , represented by the inner cone in .",
    "we require that there is no jet with a transverse energy @xmath69 within a radius @xmath70 of the photon , represented by the outer cone in .",
    "we do not include hadronic energy inside the inner cone in defining this jet .",
    "then the results at the nlo parton level do not depend on the cone size @xmath194 used in the jet algorithm , but for definiteness we suppose @xmath195 .",
    "as an example of the jet veto suppression , shows the background suppression obtained for a jet veto using @xmath193 and @xmath196 gev on top of a standard isolation cone with @xmath45 and @xmath197 gev .",
    "for this standard isolation cone the fragmentation contribution is rather small , amounting to about 10 percent of the total .",
    "this simplifies the calculation of the jet veto since we can ignore the action of the jet veto on the small fragmentation part . for the direct piece at nlo ,",
    "a jet to be vetoed amounts to a lone parton with transverse energy @xmath198 gev between the inner and outer cones @xmath199 . by ignoring the jet veto rejection of the fragmentation term ,",
    "the background is overestimated by a few percent . in this approximation , with @xmath200 gev , the bin 116 gev @xmath201 120 gev has 776 signal events and 12,600 background events , leading to a statistical significance of @xmath202 .",
    "even though the background drops from 19,000 events for the standard isolation case with @xmath45 and @xmath197 gev to 12,600 events when the jet veto is included , the statistical significance is essentially unchanged compared to this case .",
    "this illustrates the rather disappointing insensitivity of the statistical significance to the presence of the jet veto .",
    "the situation can be improved somewhat by including information from the photon angular distribution . since the higgs boson is a scalar , its decay to two photons is isotropic in its rest frame .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2 background processes tend to be more peaked toward the beam axis .",
    "thus , the angular distribution of the photons can help separate the signal from the background .     the angular distribution as a function of @xmath89 for 116 gev @xmath203 120 gev .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are @xmath204 and the smooth cone isolation cuts are @xmath205 .",
    "the higgs mass is taken to be @xmath200 gev .",
    "the peaks near @xmath206 occur in a region where the nlo calculation breaks down and is not trustworthy.,width=326 ]    shows the normalized distribution in the di - photon rapidity difference , @xmath207 .",
    "this variable is convenient because it is simple to determine experimentally , and at lowest order it is related to the center - of - mass scattering angle @xmath208 for @xmath209 or @xmath25 by @xmath80 .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are set to our default values  ( [ defaultmu ] ) , and only events in the mass bin 116  gev @xmath203 120  gev are kept .",
    "the smooth cone isolation is used with parameters @xmath73 and @xmath210 ; similar distributions are obtained using a standard cone isolation . as can be seen in the angular distribution of the higgs signal events is rather different from the background .",
    "we can estimate the significance that could be obtained by using a maximum likelihood function with this information to be @xmath211 where the sum is over the bins in @xmath89 .",
    "this number is to be compared with a significance of @xmath212 without using the angular information .",
    "the 4% relative improvement in significance should also hold roughly for @xmath89 distributions constructed using a standard cone isolation .",
    "an interesting feature in are the peaks in both the signal and background in the bins near 0.90 - 1.00 .",
    "these peaks are attributable to a breakdown of the nlo approximation near the lo kinematic boundary in @xmath89 , whose location is dictated by the @xmath213 gev cut  ( [ acccuts ] ) and @xmath214 gev . at lo the two photons are constrained to have vanishing total transverse momentum @xmath215 , which leads to @xmath216 . at nlo ,",
    "events with a radiated gluon can have nonzero @xmath217 , which removes the constraint on @xmath89 . for small @xmath217 ,",
    "the nlo cross section is very unstable and must be resummed in @xmath218 , as in refs .",
    "similar phenomena have been described in earlier work on isolated photons  @xcite .",
    "a general description of such `` edges '' has also been given  @xcite .",
    "in , @xmath219 becomes appreciable only in the two bins centered at @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "the bins to the left of @xmath222 do not contain these uncancelled logarithms because the virtual corrections , with lo kinematics , can contribute and cancel them .",
    "of course , all bins to the right of @xmath222 are effectively being calculated at lo , hence their overall normalization is not as trustworthy .",
    "one might be concerned that the parton - level normalized distributions shown in will be distorted by higher - order terms , soft physics , and detector effects , rendering the information inadequate for improving the significance of the signal . however ,",
    "this is not the case , because 1 ) only an _ approximate _ knowledge of the _ relative _ shapes of signal and background is required to get most of the benefit , and 2 ) the background distribution can be measured experimentally .",
    "once a putative peak is identified in the @xmath223 spectrum , the @xmath89 distribution in the sideband regions above and below the peak can be measured .",
    "this information , along with that in , can be used to estimate the true signal distribution , including detector effects , etc .",
    "one can then apply an optimal observable or maximum likelihood analysis similar to the one described above .",
    "the signal and background distributions as a function of @xmath85 for 116 gev @xmath203 120 gev .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are @xmath204 and the smooth cone isolation cuts are @xmath205 . the higgs mass is taken to be @xmath200 gev . , width=326 ]    the final distribution that we consider is that of @xmath224 , defined to be the rapidity of @xmath225 , the four - vector sum of the two photon momenta . for the case of the higgs signal , this is just the rapidity of the higgs boson .",
    "we plot the normalized distribution in @xmath85 in , for the same choice of mass bin , isolation cuts , and scale choices as for .",
    "the difference between the signal and the background distributions can be mostly attributed to the different parton luminosities involved in the production ; the higgs signal is produced by a predominantly @xmath84 initial state , whereas the di - photon background gets significant contributions from each of @xmath83 , @xmath64 , and @xmath84 . in this case",
    "the use of @xmath85 in a maximum likelihood function analysis would improve the significance by less than a percent .",
    "in this paper we presented a next - to - leading order study of the irreducible di - photon background , including the corrections to the gluon fusion subprocess @xmath226 .",
    "the nlo gluon fusion is the largest of the higher order contributions not included in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the scale dependence of the gluon - fusion contribution at nlo is roughly the same as at lo if the renormalization and factorization scales are varied independently , but is significantly reduced if they are varied in unison .",
    "moreover , the nlo corrections to the gluon - fusion component , as a contribution to the total irreducible background , were found to be modest , suggesting that this calculation is under adequate theoretical control .",
    "indeed , the nlo @xmath176 factor for the @xmath0 subprocess is only about 65% of the nlo @xmath176 factor for higgs production .",
    "experimental studies using the latter @xmath176 factor to estimate the former one  @xcite have therefore been a bit too conservative .",
    "using the improved calculation we investigated the statistical significance of higgs production as a function of the photon isolation cuts .",
    "we found that the significance depends only weakly on the isolation cuts .",
    "although we found a slight enhancement with more severe cuts , we noted that as isolation becomes tight , instrumental noise , soft hadrons and overlapping events can render the cuts experimentally unworkable .",
    "moreover , the perturbative predictions become subject to large corrections and are unreliable . a better procedure",
    "is to include a veto on jets near the photon candidates .",
    "this can suppress the background without suffering from the drawbacks of tight photon isolation . as an example , we computed the extra suppression due to a jet veto when the effects of fragmentation can be neglected .",
    "we found that although the background is suppressed , the statistical significance is hardly altered .",
    "more generally one would need to also include a jet veto on the fragmentation contribution , but only a weak dependence may be anticipated .",
    "the most robust improvement we found in the statistical significance of the higgs signal , albeit still modest , was obtained using the rapidity difference @xmath89 distribution of the decay photons .",
    "it would be interesting to explore other variables characterizing the distribution of hadronic energy in the events ; a strategy which optimizes the use of this information without cutting out large numbers of events may be possible .",
    "these results would need to be investigated further in a more realistic simulation than just the parton - level one we have done here . in particular , the effects of instrumental noise and overlapping events must be included  @xcite .",
    "one would also need to include a detailed study of the reducible @xmath40 background contributions  @xcite .",
    "once a more realistic study is set up , the entire range up to @xmath14 gev would need to be investigated , instead of just the single choice of @xmath200 gev used in section  [ angularsubsection ] .",
    "when the lhc di - photon data becomes available , the information provided by the sideband regions will also be crucial .    as described in the introduction",
    ", there are a number of @xmath227 contributions that still have not been included .",
    "these corrections are all expected to be smaller than the @xmath228 gluon fusion contribution incorporated into the computation presented here .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness as well as to confirm that there are no surprises , it would be useful to evaluate all remaining @xmath227 contributions .",
    "it would also be useful to incorporate a resummation of the large logarithms which appear at the kinematic edges of angular distributions  @xcite and for small cone sizes  @xcite .",
