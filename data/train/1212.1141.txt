    "since the early 1990 s there has been an interest in understanding and accessing the effects of electromigration on kinetic instabilities of crystal steps @xcite-@xcite and epitaxial islands @xcite-@xcite , and on morphological stability of epitaxial films @xcite-@xcite . among other applications ( which were developed primarily at the microscale ) , electromigration has been also used for fabrication of nanometer - sized gaps in metallic films .",
    "such gaps are suitable for testing of the conductive properties of single molecules and control of their functionalities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite describes fabrication of nanoscale contacts by using electromigration to thin down and finally break the epitaxially grown ultrathin ( 10 ml ) ag films wetting the si(001 ) substrate .",
    "the gap between contacts can be cyclically opened and closed by applying electromigration current at 80 k to open the gap , and enabling surface diffusion by annealing to the room temperature , to close it .",
    "thus for this and other emerging applications at the nanoscale @xcite it seems important to understand and characterize the effects of substate wetting and electromigration that are simulaneously active in the physical system .",
    "this paper combines these effects in a model that is based on an evolution equation(s ) for the continuous profile of the film surface .",
    "the focus is on wetting films with isotropic surface energy , but with anisotropic adatom mobility @xcite , although the model allows any combination of wetting properties and anisotropies .",
    "we factor in and discuss the effects on film stability and morphological evolution of the electric field that is either parallel , or perpendicular to the initial planar surface of the film , and do not limit considerations to small deviations from planarity , i.e. the arbitrary surface slopes and even surface overhangs are permitted by the model .",
    "models of wetting appropriate for continuum - level modeling of the surface diffusion - based dynamics of solid films have been developed and discussed extensively primarily in the context of thin film heteroepitaxy @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on one such model , called the two - layer exponential model for the surface energy @xcite , @xcite-@xcite ( which is particularly useful when the surface energy is anisotropic ) , but other models of wetting discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite can be used instead , and the results are expected to be qualitatively similar .",
    "the goal of modeling in this paper is not to match the theoretical results to the experiment @xcite and thus help in understanding the experiment , but rather to provide the broad analysis of the interplay of two effects ( wetting and electromigration ) that , at least to our knowledge , has not been addressed in prior publications .",
    "we consider a 2d single - crystal film of unperturbed height @xmath0 with the 1d parametric surface + @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the cartesian coordinates of a point on a surface , @xmath4 is the time and @xmath5 is the parameter along the surface .",
    "the origin of the cartesian reference frame is on the substrate , and along the substrate ( the @xmath2-direction ) the film is assumed infinite .",
    "the @xmath3-axis is in the direction normal to the substrate and to the initial planar film surface .",
    "surface marker particles will be used for computations of surface dynamics @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath6 ) in fact represent the coordinates of a marker particle , which are governed by the two coupled parabolic pdes @xcite : @xmath7 here ( and below ) the subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath2 denote partial differentiation with respect to these variables , @xmath9 is the normal velocity of the surface which incorporates the physics of the problem , and @xmath10 . here",

    "we had not tried to obtain an adequate nonlinear small - slope model , leaving this agenda to future research .    of course , increasing the field strength results in faster coarsening , as the times needed for coarsening into a ",
    "final \" structure are @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 for field strengths @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "these values also point out the decrease of the rate of change of a coarsening rate with the increasing field strength .",
    "other than that , the coarsening laws are similar for the three tested field strengths .",
    "fits to the data in the case @xmath150 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_coarsening_a=71](a , b ) . at small times coarsening is fast ( exponential , see fig .",
    "[ fig_coarsening_a=71](b ) ) , then it changes to a slower power law with the exponent in the range @xmath160 .",
    "( since the values of the amplitude s logarithm are negative , we were unable to fit the exponential law to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig_coarsening_a=71](a ) , thus we fitted the quadratic , which results in the @xmath161-type law . )",
    "remarkably , when @xmath106 is decreased from 10 to 6 a very different coarsening behaviors emerge , see figs .",
    "[ fig_coarsening_a71_g2_h0_6](a , b ) and [ fig_coarsening_a71_g500_h0_6](a , b ) . at @xmath118 , after the period of slow power - law coarsening at intermediate times , the coarsening accelerates to exponential coarsening or @xmath161 type coarsening at late times ( figs .",

    ", as can be expected from the _ remark 4_. while there is some evidence of acceleration , this computation breaks down too fast . ]",
    "it seems certain that such unusual dynamics in the strongly wetting states emerges due to nonlinear `` overdamping '' of electromigration - induced faceting instability by the surface - substrate interaction force . toward this end , in figs .",

    "it is reasonable to expect that in the opposite case of non - wetting films , the surface - substrate interaction will instead  sharpen up \" the hills , i.e. increase their slopes and make the surface structures appear more spatially and temporally uniform .",
