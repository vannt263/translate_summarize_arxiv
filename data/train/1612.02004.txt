    "photons are no longer our only window onto the universe .",
    "the recent detections of gw150914 and gw151226  @xcite announced the arrival of the powerful new tool of gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "in addition , particle messengers  astrophysical neutrinos and cosmic rays  have been detected at earth for some decades . however , modelling the production of gravitational waves ( hereafter gws ) and particles during extreme astrophysical events is a challenging scientific problem , requiring advanced numerical work .",
    "in contrast , the subsequent propagation of such signals across the universe is comparatively straightforwards to describe .",
    "this prompts us to ask if the _ propagation _ of different multi - messenger observables can be used as a new probe for cosmology and/or fundamental physics , independent of the complex details of particle or waveform generation .",
    "in particular , small relativistic corrections that accumulate with propagation distance may become measurable for sources at high redshifts , revealing information about the difference between null and non - null geodesics of the intervening spacetime .",
    "this has the power to tell us about both the expansion rate of the universe , and also properties of the massive particles being used to trace the geodesics .",
    "the simplest example that springs to mind is to compare the arrival times of photons and neutrinos from supernovae .",
    "however , in such a system astrophysical complexities are likely to dominate effects of interest to fundamental physics . for example , neutrinos from the famous supernovae 1987a arrived four hours _ earlier _ than the appearance of the optical counterpart , because of the prolonged escape time of photons from a dense supernova remnant @xcite .    gravitational waves , on the other hand ,",
    "suffer no such setbacks .",
    "their minimal interaction with matter  and hence negligible scattering and absorption  makes them arguably a cleaner probe , if the source itself is not the chief object of interest .",
    "for example , one could ask the following , simplistic question : given that we know neutrinos have mass , whilst gws are massless ( in gr , at least ) , how much later would the neutrinos arrive at earth  assuming the two were emitted simultaneously ?",
    "a simple calculation ( presented in appendix  [ app : basic ] ) of propagation times shows that for a source in the redshift range @xmath0 , the difference in arrival times between a gw and a typical neutrino would be of order one second .",
    "unfortunately , in a realistic scenario , there will be an additional contribution imprinted on this delay by the structure of the astrophysical source , i.e. the fact that emission of particles and gws may not commence exactly simultaneously .",
    "this _ intrinsic source delay _ could be of order seconds or longer . without detailed knowledge and modelling of the source",
    ", it would be impossible to know how to split the measured difference in arrival time into its intrinsic and particle - mass contributions .",
    "as we will show in this paper , the difficulty above can be resolved if the multi - messenger signals encounter a gravitational lensing event(s ) en route to earth .",
    "gravitational waves are subject to gravitational lensing in almost exactly the same manner as photons @xcite .",
    "a key part of the derivations presented here is to develop a description of the lensing of massive particles , a topic that seems to be curiously absent from current literature .",
    "we will find that lensing imparts an additional delay in arrival times that is sensitive to the mass - squared of the messenger particles .",
    "this _ massive time delay _ depends on a number of quantities of interest to both cosmology and particle physics , namely the mass of the particle involved , the redshift of the source , and the expansion history of the universe .",
    "given how small neutrino masses ( for example ) are expected to be , it is clear that the massive time delay will remain small for them ( @xmath1 second ) .",
    "the question we are interested in here is whether the massive time delay might nevertheless be , in some cases , large enough to be measured by a network of future gravitational wave and particle detectors .",
    "the lensing of gravitational waves is developed in @xcite , and the detection rate of such events has been discussed for the adligo @xcite , lisa @xcite and einstein telescope @xcite detector networks .",
    "clearly , a confirmed single source of all three potential messengers  photons , gravitational waves , and massive particles  could offer even further possibilities .",
    "the identification of electromagnetic counterparts to gw sources is a major focus of current gravitational wave science , and is discussed extensively elsewhere @xcite .",
    "although the sources themselves are not the main focus of this paper , let us briefly enumerate some objects from which one might expect coincident emission of massive and massless particles .",
    "* the most promising source , and the one we will generally focus on , is a merger between two neutron stars ( hereafter ns ) .",
    "this can result in the formation of a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns ) that is stable for timescales of order 10 ms .",
    "the hmns continues to accrete material from surrounding debris ; shocks associated to this high - energy accretion environment result in an outflow of neutrinos from the poles of the hmns .",
    "this neutrino outflow is generally diffuse rather than highly beamed , with typical particle energies of order @xmath2mev @xcite .",
    "* other compact object mergers may produce particle emission in addition to their gw signals , although there is a higher degree of uncertainty here .",
    "a merger between a ns and a black hole ( bh ) has the necessary matter component , although without the formation of a long - lived hmns the neutrino luminosity may be much lower @xcite .",
    "a bh - bh merger could produce particle emission if there is an accretion disc close enough to be strongly affected by the merger @xcite .",
    "* we have already mentioned supernovae above ; if these are significantly asymmetric , they can produce gws in addition to particle emissions @xcite . for recent discussions of lensed extragalactic supernovae , see @xcite .",
    "in this work we will treat a simplified scenario , considering the lensing of massless and massive relativistic particles by a single , isolated source  the strong lensing regime . in reality ,",
    "our multi - messengers are likely to experience many additional small deflections along their path , analogous to weak lensing in electromagnetic astronomy .",
    "we acknowledge from the start the existence of such complicating factors in any realistic scenario ; this work is intended to be a first step in fleshing out the key features of a hitherto unexplored phenomenon .",
    "we will discuss our omissions in  [ sec : complications ] , and leave a detailed comparison to projected experimental sensitivities for future investigation .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in  [ sec : derivation ] we derive the correction to the ` flight time ' of a massive particle , relative to a massless one , that encounters a strong gravitational lens . in  [ sec : results ] we explain how a strategy of differencing the massive and massless arrival times can ameliorate the unknown intrinsic delay between their emission .",
    "we then evaluate this differential massive time delay for some simple lens models : the singular isothermal sphere and the power - law lens . ",
    "[ sec : complications ] discusses some additional features of the phenomenon , which would likely complicate a measurement of the effects described here .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "several calculations tangential to our principal discussion are presented in the appendices .",
    "in fig .  [ lensingfigure ] we show the basic features of the system under consideration .",
    "an energetic event at redshift @xmath3 and conformal distance @xmath4 releases both massless emissions ( electromagnetic and/or gravitational radiation ) and relativistic , massive particles of mass @xmath5 . for argument s",
    "sake we will somtimes refer to these massive particles as neutrinos , though our formalism applies more generally . note that the massless and massive fluxes will not typically commence exactly simultaneously  we discuss how to deal with this in  [ sec : results ] .    .",

    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are two - dimensional position vectors of the images in the lensing plane , and @xmath11 is the position vector of the source in the plane @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the deflection angles experienced by these two rays at the lens . ]    at redshift @xmath15 and conformal distance @xmath16 , both types of emission encounter a gravitational lens with three - dimensional density profile @xmath17 . throughout this paper",
    "we will make use of the thin - lens approximation , which treats all the deflection as occurring instantaneously at a single plane .",
    "quantities relating to the lens , such as its density and gravitational potential , will be projected onto a two - dimensional plane at redshift @xmath15 .",
    "the emissions travel on multiple paths @xmath18 around this lens , with each path experiencing a total angular deflection @xmath19 and finally being received by an observer @xmath20 at angle @xmath21 to the optical axis @xmath22 ( defined as the axis connecting the observer to the centre of the lens ) . in optical strong lensing of extended sources ,",
    "these multiple paths and detection angles correspond to multiple images of the same source , often distorted in an informative way that constrains the structure of lens .",
    "the emissions we are interested in here originate from point sources . hence ,",
    "though we expect to detect multiple , identical point - sources of our massive and massless messengers , there will be no equivalent of the spatial image distortion seen in traditional optical lensing .",
    "however , in some cases it might be possible to associate the lensed point sources with lensed optical images of a host galaxy , although this will require significant advances in source localization of gw and neutrino detectors .",
    "that said , even if localization techniques do not improve sufficiently to allow the spatial resolution of lensed gw sources , emissions that have travelled along different lensed paths may still be _ temporally _ resolvable .    within the simplified model outlined above , the total conformal travel time for a massive , relativistic particle has the structure : @xmath23 the first term in this expression is the travel time from the source to the observer for a massless particle in the absence of any lens ; it is the same for all rays ( hence no dependence on @xmath24 ) , and provides the largest contribution to @xmath25 .",
    "the remaining terms describe corrections to this minimum travel time induced by the presence of the lens ; in the case of a massless particle only the first correction term in eq.([structure ] ) exists .    in principle",
    ", a massive and massless particle will be deflected by slightly different amounts at the lens  the derivation of this effect is given in appendix  [ app : point_mass ] .",
    "we would therefore expect there to be a small offset in the position of the neutrino and gw sources on - sky , as shown in fig .",
    "[ anglesfigure ] . to account for this we compare flight times along two different but very close paths , by writing the reception angle of the massive particle as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the reception angle in the massless case .     and",
    "@xmath28 respectively ) , one should evaluate their travel times along slightly different paths @xmath29 and @xmath30 . however , this turns out to produce corrections that are second - order with respect to the differential massive time delay that is the main focus of this paper .",
    "hence , in what follows , we can consider both massless and massive particles corresponding to the same image to have propagated along identical trajectories . ]    performing a taylor expansion of  ( [ structure ] ) , we then have : @xmath31 where it is sufficient to evaluate @xmath32 at @xmath27 because it is already significantly suppressed with respect to the other terms ( see eq.[massive ] to follow ) .",
    "however , in the geometric optics limit , fermat s principle tells us that a massless particle follows a path along which the travel time is stationary ; thus the third term in eq.([structure2 ] ) must vanish .",
    "hence , to first order in @xmath33 , it is sufficient to evaluate the flight time of the both massive and massless particles at the same reception angle @xmath27 .",
    "any difference in arrival times then arises purely from their null / non - null nature , rather than path differences .",
    "it is interesting to note , though , that this difference in deflection angle does exist in principle , and would need to be accounted for in high - accuracy calculations .",
    "now consider the conformal time delay between two emissions ( either massive or massless ) that travel about the lens on _ widely_-separated paths , like those shown in fig .",
    "[ lensingfigure ] .",
    "these are received at angles @xmath34 and @xmath35 , corresponding to separate point source images on the sky . the conformal time interval between their arrivals is : @xmath36 the term @xmath37 in eq.([structure ] ) makes no contribution to @xmath38 , as it is the same for both paths and therefore cancels out .",
    "hence , although @xmath25 may be a significant fraction of the age of the universe , the _ difference _ between the ( conformal ) travel time of two rays received at @xmath39 is much smaller than the hubble time , typically between a few days and a few years .",
    "since cosmological expansion is negligible over these timescales , the conformal time delay is equivalent to the physical time delay to an extremely good approximation , .",
    "that is , @xmath40 , but @xmath41 to a high degree of accuracy . ]",
    "i.e. @xmath42 therefore , following @xcite , we can safely formulate our calculation in terms of conformal distances and conformal times .",

    "our expression for the differential massive time delay ( eq.[massive ] ) depends on the redshifts of the source and lens .",
    "the lens redshift is expected to be measurable from an electromagnetic counterpart ( e.g. a massive galaxy cluster at low redshift ) , but the same is not necessarily true of the source redshift . in the case of an asymmetric supernovae",
    "this _ is _ likely to be possible , though the electromagnetic counterpart would only become visible some time ( hours to days ) after the gw and neutrino signals , due to the photon escape time of the supernovae remnant .",
    "ns mergers are a candidate for the production of short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , and so too may have an electromagnetic counterpart in a few select cases .",
    "however , grbs are thought to be beamed in a dipolar fashion , whilst gws in gr are of course quadrupolar .",
    "this implies that only a fraction @xmath209 of the ns - ns merger gw signals we receive should be accompanied by a grb @xcite .    in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart , and with current ground - based detectors , the mass and redshift of a compact merger",
    "are famously degenerate .",
    "specifically , the waveform constrains only the redshifted mass combination @xmath210 . as we discussed in  [ subsec : flux ] , this degeneracy is preserved even in the case of gravitationally lensed gws .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite have identified a method to break this degeneracy that may be achievable by future gw detectors , at least in the ns - ns merger case . in brief",
    ", the method relies on studying two effects in the gw waveform : i ) corrections to the orbital phase due to tidal effects during the inspiral stage , and ii ) prominent spectral features during the post - merger hmns phase .",
    "these two effects have different dependencies on the _ true _ total mass of the binary and its redshift , leading to near - orthogonal contours in the @xmath211 parameter plane ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .    assuming progress in determining the ns equation of state , the authors of @xcite report a mass determination within 1% accuracy for all the cases they considered .",
    "it is reasonable to speculate that when / if experiments become sufficiently mature to measure the differential massive time delay , either a ) the redshift of ns - ns mergers will be measurable from gws alone , or b ) optical counterparts will be frequently available .",
    "though it may not be necessary to have an electromagnetic counterpart for the source , it is essential for the lens . inferring the lens mass distribution from sheared optical images is now a mature field @xcite , and is crucial to step beyond the simple analytic density prescriptions used in the present work .",
    "furthermore , the optical lens image will help with sky localization of the lensed gws and neutrinos .",
    "for example , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst @xcite ) is expected to detect cluster - scale strong lenses at roughly @xmath212sq .",
    "deg@xmath213 @xcite , whilst a future gw detector network of ligo+virgo+kagra @xcite should be able to localize gw sources to less than 10 sq .",
    "degrees @xcite .",
    "hence the combined observations should be able to pin down a cluster - scale lens to within a handful of candidates . in the case of more than one candidate lens ,",
    "estimates of their redshifts and masses will be necessary to further ascertain which belongs to the system of interest .",
    "however , once the correct lens has been identified , the source of the lensed gws and neutrinos can then be localized to broadly lie within the area occupied by the optical images , at most tens of arcseconds .",
    "triangulation using a network of neutrino detectors is not expected to provide significant enhancements over the localization capabilities of a single neutrino detector @xcite , making the process of lens identification particularly crucial .",
    "the influence of multiple lensing events would also need to be modelled . in this paper",
    "we have considered a situation in which the multi - messenger signals encounter only a signal , large lens during their propagation . in reality , they are likely to additionally encounter many smaller weak lensing events by intervening matter structures @xcite , and some of these will vary over the spatial region spanned by our effective images .",
    "this will add some intrinsic scatter to the arrival time of the multi - messenger echoes .",
    "whether such scatter eradicates the differential massive time delay signal requires a detailed study of the expected deflections from large - scale structure ; we will not undertake this here .",
    "solar and atmospheric neutrino backgrounds are an obvious systematic for detection of the lensed neutrino signals discussed here ; for example , the dominant solar neutrino background at @xmath2mev is a flux of roughly @xmath214 cm@xmath213s@xmath149 from the decay of boron-8 .",
    "fortunately , extracting neutrino candidates of interest from underneath these backgrounds is a well - studied topic @xcite .",
    "the solar neutrino background can be minimized by concentrating on neutrino events with energies @xmath216mev , though this comes at the expense of a lowered count rate from our sources of interest .",
    "we note in passing that the superkamiokande collaboration were able to identify and dismiss four neutrino events that were candidates for association with the gravitational wave events gw150914 and gw151226 @xcite .",
    "our method for cancelling out the unknown intrinsic source delay (  [ subsec : strategy ] ) should work well in the case of well - sampled fluxes , e.g. if the emissions occurs as short , intense bursts .",
    "if the emissions occur over a longer timescale and is poorly sampled , there will be difficulties in recovering the matching shapes of the original signal and its echo(es ) .",
    "not only does this make successful identification of the massive echo less likely , but it will also introduce an additional source of error in the measurements of times @xmath103 and @xmath105 , and hence into @xmath107 .",
    "undoubtedly low neutrino flux counts are a major obstacle for the extragalactic sources we have talked about in this paper .",
    "it may be that the differential massive time delay will only ever be measurable for galactic sources , for which up to @xmath217 neutrino events are expected with future kiloton - scale detectors .",
    "local - group sources should also be within reach : a future neutrino experiment of several hundred kilotons is expected to detect a few dozen neutrinos from an event in the andromeda galaxy @xcite . for these sources",
    "there is no possibility of constraining cosmological parameters , but arguably any bounds on the neutrino mass should be cleaner without such degeneracies . beyond",
    "the local group begins a battle between the flux scaling as 1/distance@xmath218 and the number of sources increasing as approximately distance@xmath219 .",
    "we will not attempt a prediction of the expected outcome in the present work .",
    "note that the typical neutrino energies considered in this paper ( @xmath220 10 mev ) are below the detection threshold of some current major detectors such as icecube and antares @xcite , though superkamiokande , kamland and the sudbury neutrino observatory all have thresholds of order a few mev @xcite . whilst grbs associated to compact object mergers may produce high - energy neutrinos ( @xmath220 tev  pev ) detectable by icecube and antares , the differential massive time delay associated to these will be miniscule .",
    "still , detection of such high - energy neutrinos may help with on - sky source localization for the lower - energy neutrino counterparts .",
    "given the magnitude of the differential massive time delay ( @xmath220 0.1 @xmath184s ) , it will be necessary to know the distance between all detectors involved in the measurement to within a metre or so ( simply considering the magnitude of @xmath221 ) .",
    "based on current and improving gps sensitivities , this should not prove problematic .",
    "we have begun here an exploration of what might be learned from extreme but rare astrophysical events by future observatories detecting massless carriers , such as photons or gravitational waves , as well as massive ones , such as neutrinos or other neutral particles . in particular , we have considered the information provided by strong gravitational lensing of such signals by large massive bodies close to the line of sight to such events .",
    "we can draw an analogy between the present status of gw astronomy and the early days of cmb detection . in the year 2000 , shortly after the first cmb acoustic peak was detected by boomerang and maxima @xcite , it would have seemed absurdly optimistic to consider measuring the eigth acoustic peak with the precision now achieved by the planck satellite . yet , thanks to continual improvements in detector technology and data analysis techniques , intervening experiments ( wmap @xcite ) , and increasingly sophisticated understanding of systematics , such exquisite measurements are now possible . similarly , though measuring the effects discussed in this paper is unfeasible with present understanding and experiments , we envision an equally rapid progression for the forthcoming decade(s ) of multi - messenger astronomy .",
    "one of our goals here is to stimulate forward - thinking about the novel science that might be possible in future .    to this end",
    "we have derived an expression for the differential arrival time of massive and massless particles with a common origin .",
    "the resulting expression is sensitive to particle properties , cosmological parameters , and the masses and separations of elements in the lensing system .",
    "though we have only evaluated the magnitude of this correction for simplified lens models , it could be applied to real lensing systems whose mass distribution is relatively well - constrained . in the examples studied here , the differential time delay is found to have a magnitude of order @xmath222s .",
    "neutrino detectors are already capable of measuring such intervals , having at present a time resolution down to @xmath223ns .",
    "gw detectors lag behind somewhat  the timing resolution of the ligo detectors is currently at the @xmath224s level @xcite .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to suppose that the necessary precision will be available to future gw experiments .",
    "in addition , we note that a key feature of the differential massive time delay is a near - coincident feature in multiple media and multiple detectors .",
    "although clearly this requires a global coordination of experiments , the simultaneous nature of events should assist with the selection and rejection of candidate detections .    for ease of discussion ,",
    "we have generally referred to extragalactic merging neutron stars as a candidate source . however , we remind the reader that  under the right conditions  ns - bh mergers , bh - bh mergers , and asymmetric supernovae are all potential alternative candidates . likewise",
    ", we have generally focussed on gws as the relevant massless messenger ; photons can also take this role ( and would arguably be easier to work with ) , if one is certain that prompt emission is being detected .",
    "we have not attempted here a forecast of the constraints attainable on neutrino masses or cosmological parameters from measurements of the differential massive time delay .",
    "to do so would require a detailed description of the experiments involved ; we suspect that instruments with the required sensitivity are not even at the blueprint stage yet .",
    "although designs for the lisa observatory @xcite are progressing rapidly , the most promising sources listed above fall outside of its frequency range .    even if the differential massive time delay is not within foreseeable experimental reach for any source types , or in fact will always be lost to source uncertainties and systematics , the lensing of massive particles seems an inherently interesting and under - explored counterpart to the extensive research in optical lensing ( and the much less - studied field of gw lensing ) .",
    "several logical extensions of the present paper would be :    * a detailed study of the joint redshift distributions of candidate sources and massive galaxy clusters , resulting in an estimate for the number of simultaneous gw - neutrino lensing systems in principle detectable at earth ; * further investigation into the projected sensitivities of future gw and neutrino detectors , their timing resolutions and sky localization errors , particularly when operating as a network ; * a more sophisticated treatment of the massive particle flux expected from the sources listed in the introduction , accounting for the energy spectrum of different species and the effects of poor sampling of the burst at detection ; * the possibility that stacking signals from separate events could alleviate the issue of low count rates from extragalactic sources .",
    "for example , one might imagine stacking signals from all systems that have a source and lens in the same redshift bin .",
    "this might allow a first measurement of the extragalactic differential massive time delay , even if the stacking technique means that constraining fundamental parameters is not possible ; * investigation into the potential of the differential massive time delay and related phenomena to constrain the violation of c , p and cp symmetries in gravity .",
