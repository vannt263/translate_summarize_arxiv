    "recent astrophysical data from distant ia supernovae observations [ 1 , 2 ] show that the current universe is not only expanding , but also it is accelerating due to some kind of negative - pressure form of matter known as dark energy [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "this mysterious fluid is believed to dominate over the matter content of the universe by 70 @xmath1 and to have enough negative pressure as to drive present day acceleration . however , the nature of dark energy is still unknown , and people have proposed some candidates to describe it .",
    "there are different candidates to play the role of the dark energy .",
    "the most traditional candidate is a non - vanishing cosmological constant which can also be though of as a perfect fluid satisfying the equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "the next simple model proposed for dark energy is the quintessence [ 5 ] which is a dynamical scalar field which slowly rolls down in a at enough potential .",
    "there are different alternative theories for the dynamical dark energy scenario which have been proposed by people to interpret the accelerating universe like k - essence [ 6 ] , tachyonic field [ 7 ] , chaplygin gas [ 8 ] , phantom field [ 9 ] , etc .",
    "next we will discuss another two types of dark energy candidates i.e. , holographic and ricci dark energies .",
    "+ in quantum field theory a short distance ( uv ) cut - off is related to a long distance ( ir ) cut - off @xmath0 due to the limit set by formation of a black hole , which results in an upper bound on the zero - point energy density [ 10 ] .",
    "it is to be noted that the size @xmath0 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size [ 11 ] , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off of the effective quantum field theory .",
    "the largest ir cutoff @xmath0 is chosen by saturating the inequality , so that the holographic dark energy density [ 12 ] may be defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath7 is a numerical constant characterizing all of the uncertainties of the theory , whose value can only be determined by observations . on the basis of the holographic principle proposed by [ 13 ] several others have studied holographic model for dark energy [ 14 ] .",
    "employment of friedman equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total energy density and taking @xmath10 one can find @xmath11 .",
    "thus either @xmath12 or @xmath13 behaves like @xmath14 . if we take @xmath0 as the size of the current universe , say , the hubble radius @xmath15 then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result .",
    "there are other type of dark energy i.e. , ricci dark energy , which is a kind of holographic dark energy [ 15 ] taking the square root of the inverse ricci scalar as its infrared cutoff and this model is also phenomenologically viable .",
    "gao et al [ 16 ] proposed the dark energy density proportional to the ricci scalar @xmath16 i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "this model works fairly well in fitting the observational data , and it could also help to understand the coincidence problem .",
    "there are several works on this ricci dark energy model [ 17 ] .",
    "+ here we shall consider two types of dark energy models : ( i ) generalized holographic and ( ii ) generalized ricci dark energy models [ 18 ] . in section ii , we have found some solutions if the universe is filled with dark matter and generalized holographic / ricci dark energy .",
    "general prescriptions of first law and gsl of thermodynamics have been presented in section iii .",
    "we have shown that the first law and gsl are always valid on apparent horizon and first law can not be satisfied on the particle and event horizons in einstein s gravity .",
    "these results are always true for any types of dark energy models i.e. , these results do not depend on the dark energy models in einstein s gravity .",
    "but the gsl completely depends on the choices of dark energy models in einstein s gravity .",
    "there are several works on the validity of gsl on the particle and event horizons in various dark energy models [ 19 , 20 , 21 ] . here",
    "we shall discuss the validity of gsl in generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models in section iv .",
    "also if we consider the generalized holographic dark energy and generalized ricci dark energy as the original holographic dark energy , then our aim is to check the validity of laws of thermodynamics on the horizon of radius @xmath0 .",
    "some conclusions have been drawn in last section .",
    "the einstein s field equations for homogeneous , isotropic and flat frw universe are given by    @xmath18    and @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the hubble parameter ( choosing @xmath21 ) and @xmath9 and @xmath22 be the energy density and pressure of the fluid respectively .",
    "the conservation equation is given by    @xmath23    now let us consider the fluid is a combination of dark matter and dark energy i.e. , @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "assuming there is no interaction between dark matter and dark energy , so they are separately conserved .",
    "thus the the conservation equation ( 3 ) becomes    @xmath27    and    @xmath28    from equation ( 4 ) , we get the energy density of matter as    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is an integration constant which gives the present value of the dark energy density and @xmath31 is the redshift . + recently ,",
    "xu et al [ 18 ] proposed two types of dark energy models , i.e. , generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models as follows : + ( i ) * generalized holographic dark energy model ( ghdem ) : * the energy density of ghdem is given by ,    @xmath32    where @xmath7 is a numerical constant and @xmath33 is a positive function defined as , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a constant . here",
    "@xmath16 is the ricci scalar and its expression for flat universe is given by    @xmath36    when @xmath37 then @xmath38 , we recover the energy densities of original holographic dark energy .",
    "also when @xmath39 then @xmath40 , we recover the energy density of original ricci dark energy .",

    "@xmath48 , we get    @xmath49    from equation @xmath50 , we obtain the ricci scalar @xmath16 as ,    @xmath51    so from equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we can found the expressions for density @xmath41 and pressure @xmath52 as ,    @xmath53    and    @xmath54     + ( ii ) * generalized ricci dark energy model ( grdem ) : * the energy density of grdem is given by ,    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is a positive function defined as , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is a constant .",
    "when @xmath59 then @xmath60 , we recover the energy density of original ricci dark energy .",
    "also when @xmath61 then @xmath62 , we recover the energy density of original holographic dark energy . + now comparing ( 7 ) and ( 15 ) , we see that when @xmath63 the generalized ricci dark energy reduces to the generalized holographic dark energy and vice versa . if we replace @xmath35 by @xmath64 in equations ( 9 ) - ( 14 ) , we will get similar solutions for generalized ricci dark energy model .",
    "therefore , equations ( 9 ) - ( 14 ) are also the solutions of generalized ricci dark energy model with @xmath65 . +",
    "we consider the frw universe as a thermodynamical system with the horizon surface as a boundary of the system . here , we study the validity of first law and generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics on apparent , particle and event horizons . to study the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics through the universe we deduce the expression for normal entropy using the gibb s law of thermodynamics [ 22 ]    @xmath66    where , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are respectively entropy , pressure , volume and internal energy within the apparent / particle / event horizon and @xmath69 is the temperature on the apparent horizon ( @xmath70)/particle horizon ( @xmath71)/event horizon ( @xmath72 ) . here",

    "<S> the general descriptions of first law and generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics have studied on the apparent horizon , particle horizon and event horizon of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the first law and gsl are always valid on apparent horizon and first law can not be satisfied on the particle and event horizons in einstein s gravity . </S>",
    "<S> these results are always true for any types of dark energy models i.e. , these results do not depend on the dark energy models in einstein s gravity . </S>",
    "<S> but the gsl completely depends on the choices of dark energy models in einstein s gravity . </S>",
    "<S> here we have discussed the validity of gsl in generalized holographic and generalized ricci dark energy models . on the particle horizon gsl </S>",
    "<S> may be satisfied but on the event horizon the gsl can not be satisfied for both the dark energy models . </S>",
    "<S> also we have considered the generalized holographic dark energy and generalized ricci dark energy as the original holographic dark energy , so in this situation we have calculated the expression of the radius of the horizon @xmath0 . on this horizon </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the first law can not be satisfied . finally , on the horizon of radius @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the gsl can not be satisfied for both the dark energy models . </S>"
