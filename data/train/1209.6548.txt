    "recent approaches fall into two broad categories : the high - order approach  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the double - distribution - function approach  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as a direct extension of the isothermal lb model , the high - order model only uses one distribution function while retaining high - order terms in the equilibrium distribution function to recover the full navier - stokes ( ns ) equations",
    ". unfortunately , this approach requires a richer velocity space and as a result suffers in terms of simplicity and in some cases numerical instability .",
    "by contrast , in the double - distribution - function approach , two distribution functions are utilized : one for the velocity field and the other for the temperature field . as a result",
    ", high - order terms can be avoided and the standard lattice can be used .",
    "in addition , this approach is numerically more stable .",
    "however , to utilize the standard lattice , the energy and momentum transport equation need to be decoupled through the boussinesq approximation  ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in this case the double distribution approach does not recover the full ns equations in a strict sense .",
    "in addition to heat transfer , kinetic effects can make flows even more complex .",
    "for example , for gaseous flows at the microscale , kinetic effects have to be taken into account as the knudsen number ( kn , the ratio of the mean free path and the characteristic length ) becomes finite  @xcite .",
    "due to its kinetic origins , the lb method has been shown to be able to describe moderately complex kinetic effects  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "particularly , as the lb method can be considered as an approximation to the boltzmann - bgk equation , high - order models should , in principle , be able to go beyond ns hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "both analytical and numerical analysis have shown that using an appropriate discrete velocity set , lb models can capture kinetic effects including the knudsen layer qualitatively and provide reasonably accurate results for a range of isothermal problems  @xcite ; also , as expected , more discrete velocities generally give better predictions  @xcite .",
    "when gas - surface interactions are concerned , discrete velocity sets from even - order hermite polynomials typically perform better  @xcite . for thermal rarefied flows , despite that the velocity - slip and temperature - jump problems have been investigated using a high - order lb model  @xcite , significant effort is still required to develop robust lb methods for modeling general thermal non - equilibrium flows of engineering interest .",
    "the hermite expansion provides a systematic approach to derivation of the lb models for representing the ns hydrodynamic systems and beyond  @xcite .",
    "the usage of the hermite expansion was pioneered by @xcite for approximating solutions to the boltzmann equation .",
    "an important feature of hermite polynomials is that the expansion coefficients correspond directly to moments of the distribution function .",
    "in addition , the truncation of higher - order terms does not directly alter the lower - order velocity moments of the distribution function . in his famous paper ,",
    "grad kept the first thirteen hermite coefficients and obtained the well known 13-moment system  @xcite .",
    "this system contains physics beyond the ns equation .",
    "however , a significant weakness of grad s 13-moment system is its inability to describe smooth shock structures above a critical mach number .",
    "also , this system is not easily related a priori to the knudsen number . as a result",
    ", significant effort has been devoted towards the development of an improved moment system in the last decade .",
    "regularization for grad s 13 moment system ( i.e. , the so - called r13 system ) has been introduced on the basis of a chapman - enskog expansion around a non - equilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "the related issues associated with the numerical scheme and boundary conditions have then been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a series of analytical solutions were also obtained and compared to the kinetic solutions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the r13 system , higher - order moment equation models have also been developed @xcite .",
    "inspired by grad s work , the hermite expansion has been used to derive new lb models @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the truncation of the hermite expansion is equivalent to evaluating the distribution function at the chosen order of the discrete velocities .",
    "thus , the resulting lb models can describe gaseous systems at the corresponding level .",
    "however , contrary to grad s approach , the governing equation of lb models is presented in a much simpler form ( e.g. , the linear convective term ) as the evolution is accomplished at the distribution function level rather than the state - variable level .",
    "therefore , the lb model has some advantages , e.g. , straightforward numerical implementation and code parallelisation .    in this work ,",
    "we establish a thermal lb model based on the ellipsoidal statistical bhatnagar - gross - krook ( es - bgk ) equation following the systematic procedure of high - order hermite expansion .",
    "the resulting model features an adjustable prandtl number in contrast to the bgk model whose prandtl number is fixed at 1 .",
    "we validate our model using shear - driven ( couette ) flows , fourier flows and unsteady boundary heating problems in the small mach - number limit over a range of knudsen numbers . using only a moderate set of discrete velocities",
    ", we find very good agreement with benchmark solutions .",
    "we also show that , with the same moderate discrete velocity set , highly non - equilibrium problems characterized by high mach numbers , such as force - driven poiseuille flow for large values of the driving force , are captured accurately in the slip - flow regime and with good qualitative accuracy in the transition regime .",
    "better accuracy requires a higher number of discrete velocities , in addition to higher - order hermite expansion .",
    "the difficulty associated with solving the boltzmann equation is mainly due to the collision term . to reduce the complexity",
    ", the collision term may be replaced by a simple statistical model that preserves the conservation laws of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "the most commonly - used model is known as the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) collision operator , which is often used in constructing lattice boltzmann models . despite its success ,",
    "the bgk model suffers from a number of drawbacks : specifically , it yields a fixed prandtl number ( pr ) of unity , while the correct value for a monatomic gas is close to @xmath4 . to address this limitation ,",
    "@xcite proposed the es - bgk model which replaces the maxwellian distribution of the standard bgk equation with an anisotropic gaussian distribution .",
    "this model can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the single - particle distribution function , @xmath7 the phase ( particle ) velocity , @xmath8 the body force and @xmath9 the mean relaxation time which is assumed to be independent of particle velocity .",

    "the viscosity and thermal conduction coefficients can be written as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , where @xmath27 is the spatial dimension .",
    "therefore , the prandtl number is given by @xmath28 and can be adjusted via the free parameter @xmath23 . for thermal flows , viscosity depends on temperature , and can be expressed as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is related to the molecular interaction model , varying from @xmath0 for hard - sphere molecular interactions to @xmath31 for maxwellian interactions .",
    "therefore , in general , @xmath9 may be taken to be a function of temperature .",
    "the es - bgk model has received renewed attention , in part because the associated h theorem was recently proven  @xcite .",

    ", we will also present _ numerical _ solutions of the boltzmann equation with the es - bgk collision operator obtained using the finite difference / discrete velocity method presented in  @xcite .",
    "although this method is not practical for problems of engineering interest due to the high dimensionality associated with the very fine discretization of the velocity space , it can be used to obtain accurate solutions of the es - bgk equation in the one - dimensional benchmark problems considered here . in order to differentiate from our lattice - based solutions",

    "numerical_.      @xcite have shown that a hierarchy of different order lb models can be systematically derived from the bgk equation via the hermite expansion , which can be regarded as approximations to the bgk equation .",
    "gas flows can then be described at the kinetic level with various discrete velocity sets .",
    "this procedure can also be used to derive the lattice es - bgk model . for convenience , we use the following non - dimensional system , @xmath32    @xmath33 the temperature and state equations become @xmath34 @xmath35 the non - dimensional relaxation time can be written explicitly as @xmath36 where the knudsen number is defined by @xmath37    to solve eq.([eq : esbgk ] ) , the distribution function is first projected onto a functional space spanned by the hermite basis .",

    ", a 4th - order hermite expansion will be used .",
    "given the above discussion , the es - bgk equation eq.([eq : esbgk ] ) can be rewritten in its truncated form , i.e. , @xmath58    for a 4th - order expansion , a discrete velocity set with 9th - order or higher accuracy is required  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of ways of constructing a high - order discrete velocity set  @xcite .",

    "if desired , this discussion can be extended to solutions of higer order .",

    "hence , according to the gaussian quadrature rule ( cf .",

    "furthermore , it may be better to understand the requirement on the quadrature for the corresponding accuracy as necessary rather than sufficient .",

    "typically , if a first - order upwind finite difference is chosen , we have a standard stream - collision scheme .",

    "meanwhile , there is still no general and accurate implementation of the standard stream - collision scheme for high - order models , especially for rarefied flows . on the other hand , for high - order lb models ,",
    "the discrete velocity points may not coincide with the lattice points , which makes the standard stream - collision procedure impossible .",

    "the results of the bgk equation and its lattice version ( @xmath127 ) are also presented .",
    "these two models predict a temperature maximum that is @xmath157 higher than the hard - sphere result .    results for couette flows in the transition regime are presented in figs .",
    "[ couetteut ] and  [ couettesh ] .",
    "overall , our model predictions for the velocity , shear stress and heat flux are close to those of dsmc even for @xmath135 .",
    "however , our predictions of the viscous - heating - induced temperature field start to deviate from the dsmc results at @xmath158 . remarkably , the heat flux predictions of the lattice model are still in excellent agreement with the dsmc data for @xmath133 as large as 0.5 .    to further validate the model accuracy beyond the ns level ,",
    "the profiles of shear stress @xmath159 and stream - wise heat flux @xmath160 are presented in fig.([couetteqxsyy ] ) , which are both zero at the ns level of approximation . however , our lattice model can give reasonable predictions for @xmath159 up to @xmath158 which is consistent with the temperature prediction .",
    "for the heat flux @xmath160 , we have similar observation , which further confirms that our model can describe kinetic effects beyond the ns level with the chosen moderate 11-th order quadrature , which is consistent with the discussion in sec.[remarkaccuracy ] .",
    "it is also interesting to compare with the predictions of the r13 model , which is supposed to give a stable set of transport equations of the super - burnett order @xcite .",
    "fig.([couetteqxsyy ] ) shows that the r13 model and our lattice model give similar results .",
    "the simulation results for poiseuille flows at four knudsen numbers are depicted in figs .",
    "[ posiut ] and  [ posish ] .",
    "this flow is more numerically challenging compared to the couette flow . even for @xmath133 as small as 0.1 , the temperature profiles show significant difference between the lattice model and dsmc results , even though the bimodal temperature distribution  @xcite can be qualitatively captured by the lattice model at @xmath158 .",
    "as the knudsen number increases further , the difference becomes even larger , though the temperature minimum at the center of the computational domain can be predicted qualitatively .",
    "remarkably , but also consistently with the couette flow case , the heat flux profiles show good agreement with the dsmc data despite the more significant discrepancies in the temperature profiles .",
    "the inability of our model to predict accurate viscous heating may be caused by two factors .",
    "first , as shown in the derivation process , the lattice model approaches the corresponding kinetic model via the moment representation with increasing order of gauss - hermite quadrature .",
    "as discussed in sec.[remarkaccuracy ] , the chosen moderate discrete velocity set is only expected to approach the burnett level , which may not be sufficient to capture all kinetic effects in the presence of a non - negligible mach number .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "[ cvg ] where its is shown that enriching the discrete velocity set can improve the model accuracy .",
    "in addition to the error due to a finite number of discrete velocities , the es - bgk equation itself is a model which may be failing in these flows .",
    "in fact , as shown by some studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the es - bgk equation tends to produce inaccurate velocity distribution functions .",
    "the possibility that the es - bgk model is itself contributing to the error can be confirmed by the results presented in fig .  [ posiesut ] . at @xmath135",
    "the lattice model result shows a significant deviation from the numerical solution of the es - bgk model .",
    "meanwhile , the temperature profile from numerical solution of the es - bgk equation itself shows a large deviation from the dsmc result .    while the comparisons with the dsmc solutions for the temperature difference of @xmath161 have been shown in fig .",

    "the resulting lattice es - bgk model features an adjustable prandtl number and may thus be more appropriate for use in coupled thermofluidic phenomena .",
    "this generic procedure may be applied to other kinetic model equations .",
    "we have validated the lattice model for combined thermal and rarefaction effects by comparing its predictions with the dsmc and lvdsmc results as well as numerical solutions of the es - bgk model .",
    "we find that , for a moderate 11th - order discrete velocity set , the proposed model can provide reasonable predictions for couette and force - driven poiseuille flows for knudsen numbers up to @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , it is able to accurately predict heat conduction in the slip - flow and early transition regimes",
    ". this finding extends to unsteady problems provided the additional kinetic effects due to their time - dependence are also considered : for an unsteady boundary heating problem reasonable agreement with lvdsmc simulations is observed for knudsen numbers up to @xmath0 and strouhal numbers up to @xmath153 .",
    "the solutions obtained by the lattice boltzmann method are expected to approach the `` true '' solutions of the es - bgk equation as the number of discrete velocities and the hermite expansion order is increased .",
    "however , the moderate discrete velocity set used here already represents a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy for flows with a range of knudsen and strouhal numbers .",
