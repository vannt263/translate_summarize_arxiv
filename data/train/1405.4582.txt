    "as a number of concrete structures currently in service reach the end of their expected serviceable life , nondestructive testing ( ndt ) methods to evaluate their durability , and thus to ensure their structural integrity , have received gradually increasing attention .",
    "concrete often degrades by the corrosion of the embedded reinforcing bars , which can lead to internal stress and thus to structurally disruptive cracks @xcite .",
    "various ndt techniques are currently used to monitor the reliability and condition of reinforced concrete structures without causing damage .",
    "they include impact - echo , half - cell potential , electrical resistivity testing , ground penetrating radar , ultrasonic testing , infrared thermographic techniques , and related tomographic imaging techniques @xcite .",
    "each technique has its intrinsic limitations in terms of reliability of defect detection , and the conventional techniques often depend on the subjective judgment of the inspectors",
    ". the limitations of existing methods have led to searches for more advanced visual inspection methods to detect invisible flaws and defects on the surface of concrete structures .",
    "electric methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ( ert ) and electrical capacitance tomography ( ect ) have been used to image cracks and steel reinforcing bars , which show clear electrical contrast from the background concrete .",
    "these electric methods can be used to complement acoustic methods by assessing different characteristics .",
    "they operate at low cost over long time periods .",
    "ert and ect employ multiple current sources to inject currents , and boundary voltages are then measured using voltmeters connected to multiple surface electrodes on the boundary of the imaging subject .",
    "these methods use the relationship between the applied current and the measured boundary voltage to invert the image of cracks and reinforcing bars .",
    "the methods suffer from a low defect location accuracy due to the ill - posedness of the corresponding inverse problem .",
    "in fact , the boundary current - voltage measurement alone may not be sufficient for robust identification of defects .",
    "most of research outcomes had cooperated with some form of a prior information to deal with ill - posedness @xcite .",
    "they suffer from low defect location accuracy owing to the ill - posed nature of the corresponding inverse problem .",
    "the boundary current - voltage measurement alone may not be sufficient for the robust identification of defects .",
    "most of the previous methods can detect cracks and reinforcing bars when either only the crack or the bar exists in the concrete samples .",
    "numerous experiments show that ert or ect applied with a single frequency struggle to identify both cracks and reinforcing bars when electrical currents are blocked by insulating cracks near the electrodes .",
    "this paper focuses on electrical impedance spectroscopy - based ndt , viewing as an integrated ert / ect modality .",
    "it provides mathematical analysis to support a better method of visually inspecting defects in concrete structures .",
    "a thorough understanding of the frequency - dependent effects of thin insulating cracks could be used to image cracks and reinforcing bars : low - frequency electrical currents are blocked by insulating cracks , whereas high - frequency currents can pass through the conducting bars without being blocked by thin cracks .",
    "the mathematical analysis assumes that the background concrete is roughly homogeneous .",
    "the effective admittivity of the concrete could be regarded as roughly constant at coarse grid , despite it comprising a complex mixture of several materials .",
    "the proposed impedance - spectroscopy - based ndt method can provide visual assessment of the condition of a concrete structure , instead of coarse structure information , through tomographic images of the effective admittivity of the heterogeneous concrete structure .    in this paper ,",
    "the cracks are modeled as thin inhomogeneities in the concrete , while the reinforcing bars are modeled as small inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "two operating frequency regimes are considered : low and high . based on @xcite ,",
    "the corresponding asymptotic expansion of the boundary voltage is established here at these two frequency regimes .",
    "the main purpose is to show that multi - frequency impedance measurements can be used to visualize different objects . for simplicity",
    ", cracks are idealized as linear segments .",
    "the numerical simulations use a conventional 16-channel eit system , with the electrical current applied between two adjacent electrodes at different frequencies .",
    "the boundary voltage data are then measured between two adjacent electrodes attached on the surface .",
    "frequency - difference eit reconstruction allows the detection of both the cracks and the reinforcing bars within the concrete structures .",
    "a variety of numerical experiments is presented here to illustrate the main findings .",
    "for rigorous analysis , we use the simplified two - dimensional model by considering axially symmetric cylindrical sections under the assumption that the out - of - plane current density is negligible in an imaging slice . we assume a two dimensional electrically conducting domain @xmath0 with its connected @xmath1-boundary @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the conductivity distribution of the domain by @xmath2 and the permittivity distribution by @xmath3 . inside @xmath0 , there exist thin cracks @xmath4 and reinforcing bars @xmath5 as shown in figure [ fig : cmodel ] .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the collections of the reinforcing bars and cracks , respectively .",
    "since the conductivity @xmath2 and permittivity @xmath8 change abruptly across the reinforcing bars and cracks , we denote @xmath9 because the cracks are highly insulating and the reinforcing bars are highly conducting , we consider the following two extreme contrast cases : @xmath10    the inverse problem is to identify the cracks @xmath11 and reinforcing bars @xmath12 from measured current - voltage data in multi - frequency eit system . in the frequency range below 1mhz ( @xmath13 ) , we inject a sinusoidal current @xmath14 at @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the magnitude of the current density on @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the injected current produces the time - harmonic potential @xmath19 in @xmath0 which is dictated by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the outward unit normal vector on @xmath17 , and @xmath23 is the normal derivative . setting @xmath24 , we can obtain a unique solution @xmath19 to ( [ eq : uw ] ) from the lax - milgram theorem .",

    ", we may inject @xmath28 number of linearly independent currents at several angular frequencies @xmath29 and measure the induced corresponding boundary voltages .",
    "we collect these current - voltage data @xmath30 at various frequencies ranging from 10hz to 1mhz which will be used to detect cracks and reinforcing bars .    to carry out rigorous analysis",
