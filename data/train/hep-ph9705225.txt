    "simply speaking , the main task in the investigation of hadronic physics is how to provide a qcd description of hadronic structure .",
    "more specifically , how can we compute directly from qcd the fruitful hadronic properties , such as the hadronic structure functions in lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scatterings , the partonic fragmentation functions in high energy hadron - hadron or @xmath0 collisions , and many hadronic form factors in various hadronic decay processes . however , although qcd has been accepted as a fundamental theory of the strong interaction that governs the underlying dynamics of hadronic constituents , a complete qcd description to hadronic structure is still lacking . in this series of lectures , i will attempt to show you that the light - front formulation of field theory may provide a natural and systematic qcd description to all the processes mentioned above [ @xcite ] .",
    "historically , light - front dynamics played a very important role in every step of the development of the strong interaction theory .",
    "the most important application of light - front dynamics to hadronic physics is perhaps the parton phenomena in the lepton - nucleon deep inelastic scatterings ( dis ) .",
    "as it is well - known , dis probes hadronic dynamics near the light - cone .",
    "physically , the dis phenomena can be understood in terms of feynman s parton picture [ @xcite ] . while , only the light - front formulation of field theory can provide a natural quantum field theory description of parton dynamics . for examples ,",
    "the leading contributions of the unpolarized structure function @xmath1 and the polarized structure function @xmath2 in dis are simply written in terms of hadronic matrix elements on the light - front surface @xmath3 : @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the light - front quark field operator , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 the quark charge operator , and @xmath9 the hadronic states .",
    "it can be shown that in the light - front field theory , eqs.([f2 ] ) and ( [ g1 ] ) are proportional to the momentum and helicity distributions of partons ( quarks and gluons ) inside hadrons respectively .",
    "other structure functions ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) also have a similar but a bit complicated expressions . nevertheless , it is obvious that if we knew the hadronic bound states @xmath9 from qcd on the light - front , we could completely understand the qcd dynamics of dis .",
    "another measurement of hadronic structure in terms of light - front hadronic matrix elements is the parton fragmentation functions in hadron - hadron and other collisions . during high - energy collisions ,",
    "many hard partons are produced and then are hadronized .",
    "hadronization processes can be characterized by the so - called fragmentation functions which is also introduced initially by feynman [ @xcite ] .",
    "physically , quark and gluon fragmentation functions are probabilities of finding hadrons in a hard parton produced in collisions .",
    "these fragmentation functions can be defined as matrix elements of quark and gluon operators at light - front separations . for examples",
    ", the unrenormalized quark fragmentation function is given by [ @xcite ] @xmath12 and the gluon fragmentation function is defined as @xmath13 where tr traces the color and dirac components of quarks .",
    "again , if we knew hadronic bound states from qcd on the light - front , we could directly study the qcd dynamics represented by these fragmentation functions .    in recent years , light - front formulation has also been widely used in the phenomenological study of hadronic form factors involving in various hadron elastic scatterings and decay processes , by the use of the so - called relativistic quark model or light - front quark model [ @xcite ] .",
    "simply speaking , light - front quark model is based on truncated fock space expansion of light - front bound states ( upon only the valence quark states ) and then phenomenologically determines the valence fock states amplitude ( the wavefunction ) . unlike the study of the structure functions and the fragmentation functions where the use of light - front description can make the physical picture manifestation ,",
    "the interesting feature of using light - front description to hadronic decay processes is that the simple boost operations and the transparent relativistic properties containing in light - front bound states may allow one to describe hadronic form factors for entire kinematic range of momentum transfer for these space - like processes .",
    "this is quite different from descriptions of other hadronic quark models , such as the nonrelativistic constituent quark model and the beg model , which are normally believed to be applicable only for the processes involving small momentum transfer .",
    "very recently , applications of light - front quark model have also been extended to the description of various heavy meson decay processes , although most of the investigations are limited to the calculations of form factors at zero momentum transfer , due to the limitation of using the light - front quark model for time - like processes . extending the light - front quark model incorporated with higher fock space contribution ( a more realistic light - front bound state description ) may make the description of hadronic decay form factors become possible for the entire kinematic range of momentum transfer .",
    "nevertheless , all the hadronic form factors are extracted from some hadronic matrix elements , such as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a transition operator in the corresponding process . again , if we knew the associated hadronic bound states that solved from qcd on the light - front , we would have a true qcd description of hadronic decay processes .",
    "the above analysis indicates that once we know how to solve the hadronic bound states from qcd , especially for these defined on a surface of light - front , we can directly calculate various hadronic matrix elements involved in many hadronic processes .",
    "then a true qcd description of hadronic physics may be realized .",
    "this series of lectures is devoted to the light - front formulation of qcd dynamics and the attempt of solving hadronic bound states , especially the heavy hadron bound states , directly from such a formulation . in the first lecture",
    ", i will mainly discuss the general structure of hadronic bound states on the light - front .      in the standard language of field theory ,",
    "relativistic bound states and resonances are identified by the occurrence of poles in green functions .",
    "although the information extracted from this approach provides a good definition of physical particles , the ordinary wave function structure of bound states in the usual quantum mechanics language is lacked . as a result",
    ", wave function amplitudes extracted from green functions may not be universally valid in the calculations of various hadronic matrix elements that measured in experiments . in order to understand hadronic structure in terms of hadronic bound state wavefunctions ( which is the most transparent picture in quantum theory ) , the explicit form of hadronic bound states on some fixed time surface",
    "is wanted .    however , solving bound states in field theory as an eigenstate problem has not been well established .",
    "one may define the bound states as eigenstates of @xmath16 and determine these states by solving the eigenequation of @xmath16 .",
    "but @xmath16 is a square root function of the momentum and mass operators which does not give us a clear picture of the schrdinger s eigenstate equation in quantum mechanics .",
    "the widely used framework of finding relativistic bound states is the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "however , bethe - salpeter equation itself involve many unsolved problems , such as the physical interpretation of the bethe - salpeter amplitudes , and the numerical difficulty in solving the bethe - salpeter equation in space - time space , etc .",
    "some approximations , such as instant - time approximation , may simplify the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "but with such approximation , the main properties of relativistic dynamics , namely the boost dynamics , will be lacking .",
    "in other words , the results may be no longer relativistic .    also ,",
    "in principle , a relativistic bound state can always be written as an operator function of the particle creation operators acting on the vacuum of the theory . however , for many theories that we are interested in , especially for qcd , the vacuum is very complicated . with a complicated vacuum , formally writing down a relativistic bound state as a series of fock space expansion also becomes very difficult .",
    "however , these subtle problems may be removed when we look at the bound states on the light - front .",
    "_ light - front vacuum_. in the equal - time framework , the vacuum of qcd is crucial for a realization of chiral symmetry breaking and color confinement .",
    "it is also a starting point in the construction of hadronic bound states .",
    "however , the understanding of the true qcd vacuum is still very limited , although a lot of informative work has been carried out in the past two decades based on the instanton phenomena [ @xcite ] and the qcd sum rule [ @xcite ] .    in the light - front coordinates",
    ", a particle s momentum is divided into the longitudinal component and the transverse components . for",
    "a physical ( on - mass - shell ) particle , its longitudinal momentum , @xmath17 , can not be negative since the energy of a physical state always dominates its momentum . as a result",
    ", the light - front vacuum for any interacting field theory can only be occupied by the particles with zero - longitudinal momentum , namely @xmath18 so that @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "at this point , the light - front vacuum is still not simple . in the past several years , to obtain a nontrivial light - front vacuum , many tried to solve the so - called zero - mode ( the particles with @xmath21 ) problem [ @xcite ] .    to construct hadronic bound states consisting of many quarks and gluons",
    ", one will naturally ask whether it is possible to express hadronic states in terms of fock space expansion with a trivial vacuum .",
    "it is obvious that if we could `` remove '' from the theory the basic constituents with zero longitudinal light - front momentum , the vacuum of the full interacting theory would be the same as the free field theory , namely @xmath22    it must note that here `` removing '' from the theory the basic constituents with zero longitudinal light - front momentum does not mean to simply ignore dynamics of these constituents and their contributions to the bound states .",
    "mathematically , one can remove these constituents with zero longitudinal momentum by either using a prescription that requires the field variables to satisfy the antisymmetric boundary condition in the light - front longitudinal direction [ @xcite ] or dealing with a cutoff theory that imposing a cutoff , @xmath23 , on the momentum expansion of each field variable , where @xmath24 is a small number [ @xcite ] .",
    "thus , the positivity of longitudinal momentum with such a prescription or an explicit cutoff ensures that the light - front vacuum must be trivial .",
    "now a relativistic bound state can be expressed as an ordinary fock state expansion : @xmath25 for qcd , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the gluon , quark and antiquark creation operators with nonzero longitudinal momentum , and @xmath28 must also be a color singlet operator as a polynomial function of @xmath29 .",
    "light - front bound state equation_. once the light - front vacuum becomes trivial and the light - front bound states for various hadrons are expanded in terms of the fock space , the dynamic equation to determine these states is rather simple .",
    "explicitly , a hadronic bound state labeled by @xmath30 with total longitudinal and transverse momenta @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and helicity ( the total spin along the longitudinal direction ) @xmath33 can be expressed as follows : @xmath34 in eq.([wf1 ] ) , @xmath35 represents @xmath35 constituents contained in the state @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the helicity of the @xmath38-th constituent , and @xmath39 denotes the integral over the space : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fraction of the total longitudinal momentum that the @xmath38-th constituent carries , and @xmath42 is its relative transverse momentum with respect to the center of mass frame : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 being the transverse and longitudinal momentum of the @xmath38-th constituent .",
    "@xmath46 is the amplitude of the fock state @xmath47 which satisfies the following normalization condition : @xmath48    the eigenstate equation that the wave functions obey on the light - front is obtained from the operator einstein equation @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the light - front hamiltonian .",
    "futhermore , since the boost on the light - front only depends on kinematics , boosting a bound state from one lorentz frame to any other frame is quite simple , and is dynamically independent [ @xcite ] .",
    "thus , if we found the bound state in the rest frame , we could completely understand the particle structure in any frame .",
    "this is not true in the instant form . in the instant form ,",
    "the solutions in the rest frame are not easily boosted to other lorentz frames due to the dynamical dependence of the boost transformation .",
    "therefore , in each different lorentz frame , one needs to solve the bound state equation of @xmath16 to obtain the corresponding wave functions .",
    "this is perhaps the reason why one has not established a reliable approach to construct relativistic wave functions in the instant field theory in terms of the schrdinger picture .",
    "this obstacle is removed on the light - front .    to see the explicit form of the light - front bound state equation ,",
    "let us consider a meson wave function ( for instance , a pion ) .",
    "the light - front bound state equation can be expressed as : @xmath52 of course , to exactly solve the above equation for the whole fock space is still impossible .",
    "practically , one has to truncate the fock space to only include these fock states with a small number of particles .",
    "for example , one may truncate all the high order fock space sectors ( approximately ) from the valence constituent space .",
    "then the light - front bound state equation is reduced to the light - front bethe - salpeter equation : @xmath53 note that in eq.([lfbse ] ) , @xmath54 denotes an effective two - body interaction kernel . in other words , by  truncating \" the fock space to only keep the valence quark states , the complicated eq.([bse ] ) is reduced to the manable eq.([lfbse ] ) but the dominant contribution of higher fock space to the bound states must be now described effectively by @xmath54 .",
    "the residual effect should be manageable in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "a true nonperturbative qcd solution to the hadronic bound states is if one were able to derive these effective interactions directly from qcd rather than that phenomenologically are put by hand .",
    "this will be discussed in the last lecture .      at the present time ,",
    "how to solve for the bound states discussed above from qcd is still unclear .",
    "hence , it may be useful to have some insights into the light - front behavior of the meson and baryon wave functions which have been constructed phenomenologically in describing hadrons .",
    "in fact , the phenomenological light - front meson and baryon bound states have been studied extensively in the last few years , based on the light - front quark model or light - front wavefunction description .",
    "the motivation of light - front quark model is to provide a simple relativistic constituent quark model for mesons and baryons that can yield a consistent description of the hadronic processes for both low and high momentum transfer .",
    "the general construction of the phenomenological wave functions is motivated by that of the non - relativistic constituent quark model .",
    "the constituent quark model has been very successful in the description of hadronic spectroscopy with a very simple structure , namely that all mesons consist of a quark and antiquark pair and the baryons are made of three constituent quarks , their wave functions satisfy the @xmath55 classification and zweig s rule which suppresses particle production in favor of rearrangement of constituents for hadrons [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , such a simple picture is very difficult to be understood within qcd , due to its nonrelativistic assumption and due to our belief that qcd vacuum must be very complicated so that hadrons must contain an infinite number of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons .",
    "light - front bound states describe the relativistic hadronic structure with a nonrelativistic form .",
    "furthermore , the simple vacuum state on the light - front ensures the validity of the fock state expansion of hadronic states . with the assumption of existence of constituent quarks ( of masses of hundreds of mevs ) , the leading approximation to hadronic states that consist of a quark - antiquark pair for mesons and a three - quark cluster for baryons should be a reasonable starting point .",
    "more theoretical discussion for such a assumption from low energy qcd will be given later .",
    "however , it must note that there is a subtle problem in the description of hadronic structure in terms light - front bound states .",
    "that is , it is not easy to identify the light - front hadronic bound states with hadronic states which are commonly characterized by spin as a good quantum number . on the light - front , we are unable to kinematically construct the hadronic bound states with fixed spin .",
    "the light - front bound states discussed in the last section are labeled by helicity rather than spin . in these calculations of the parton distribution and fragmentation functions ,",
    "the hadronic bound states are defined or classified in terms of the helicity . however ,",
    "when we use the light - front bound states to compute the hadronic structural quantities , such as hadronic decay form factors and coupling constants , we must have states with a definite spin .",
    "a general solution to the spin problem on the light - front has not been found .",
    "however , phenomenologically , the helicity part of the bound states on the light - front can be transformed to a light - front spin part via the so - called melosh transformation ( which is exact _ only _ for free quark theory ) such that the hadronic states may be projected ( approximately but no necessary to be correct ) from the set of light - front bound states labeled with helicities .",
    "here , i list some meson and baryon light - front bound states that have been used to calculate various hadronic quantities in the past few years .",
    "the general form of the phenomenological light - front hadronic bound states has a similar structure to the constituent quark model states : for meson states ( with only the @xmath56 fock space sector ) , @xmath57 and for baryon states ( with the three quark fock space sector ) , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the amplitude of the corresponding @xmath56 or three quark sector ( the wave function of the quark model ) : @xmath60 with @xmath61 the flavor part of the wave function which is the same as in the constituent quark model , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the spin and space parts that depend on the dynamics . by ignoring the dynamic dependence of the spin configuration and by using the melosh transformation",
    "[ @xcite ] , @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the pauli spin matrix , @xmath67 the @xmath38-th constituent quark mass , and @xmath68 satisfies @xmath69 the light - front spin wave function can be given by @xmath70 for mesons ; for baryons the spin part is rather complicated for a detailed construction , see for example ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] . the momentum part of the wave function may be written as @xmath71 for meson , where @xmath72 ; and for baryons @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a normalization constant and @xmath75 is a parameter fixed by the data .",
    "other phenomenological light - front wave functions have also been used .",
    "these phenomenological light - front wave functions have been widely used to calculate hadronic form factors and coupling constants [ @xcite ] ; the results look pretty good for a very broad range of momentum transfer , and should provide a much better description than the nonrelativistic constituent quark model and other phenomenological descriptions",
    ".    nevertheless , all these are just some phenomenological examinations of light - front hadronic wave functions . the true strong interaction description of hadronic structure is the solution of the bound state equation , eq.([bse ] ) or approximately eq.([lfbse ] ) , from qcd .",
    "this is the main task of the recently development of qcd formulated on the light - front . in the remaining lectures",
    ", i will discuss the qcd formulation on the light - front and then explore its application to heavy quark systems , based heavily on the works which have been done with my collaborators in the last few years [ @xcite ] .",
    "light - front qcd that i am going to discuss is the theory of qcd formulated on a light - front surface with the light - front gauge @xmath76 . before start the discussion on lfqcd , i would like to make a few remarks : first of all , i would like to claim that any problem of qcd that can be solved in the instant formulation should be undoubtedly solved on the light - front .",
    "this is not surprise at all !",
    "however , the importance of lfqcd is that we hope to solve the subtle problems in qcd that have not been solved in the instant form , such as color confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking problems . to reach this goal",
    ", one may need to have some relatively complete knowledge on the canonical formulation of lfqcd and from which to find the key problem associated with these subtleties .",
    "hence , in this lecture , i will introduce the canonical form of light - front qcd , then discuss the origin of the light - front gauge singularity and the light - front two - component formulation of qcd which has some very special structure for field theory that are only manifested on the light - front .",
    "the qcd lagrangian is defined by @xmath77 where @xmath78 $ ] , @xmath79 is a @xmath80 gluon field color matrix and the @xmath81 are the generators of the @xmath82 color group : @xmath83=if^{abc}t^c$ ] and @xmath84 .",
    "the field variable @xmath85 describes quarks with three colors and @xmath86 flavors , @xmath87 is the symmetric covariant derivative , and @xmath88 is an @xmath89 diagonal quark mass matrix .",
    "the lagrange equations of motion are well - known : @xmath90    the following discussion and also that of the next lecture are mainly based on the work in collaboration with a. harindranath [ @xcite ] .      to formulate the qcd on the light - front , the following light - front notations will be adopted : the space - time coordinate is denoted by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the light - front time - like component , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are respectively the light - front longitudinal and transverse components .",
    "the light - front derivatives are given by @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "the product of two four - vectors is written as @xmath98 .",
    "the canonical theory of qcd on the light - front is constructed with the choice of the light - front gauge @xmath99 .",
    "the first question you may ask is why we choose the light - front gauge .",
    "the answer is as follows :    on the light - front , the quark ( more generally the fermion ) fields can be decoupled into @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "then the dirac equation ( [ dirace ] ) can be separated into : @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "it shows that the component @xmath104 is a constraint field variable , which can be solved nonperturbatively from the about equation only if we take @xmath76 !",
    "@xmath105    secondly , due to gauge symmetry among the four components of the vector gauge filed , only two of them are the physically independent variables . by taking @xmath76 , the equation of motions ( [ gfe ] ) for @xmath106",
    "is simply reduced to @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the light - front color charge density .",
    "this is indeed the light - front gauss law which can be used to determines @xmath109 in terms of @xmath110 and @xmath111 : @xmath112 where the operator @xmath113 will be defined later .",
    "it shows that with the light - front gauge , we can explicitly eliminate all the unphysical gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "now , we can write a simple close form for the lfqcd lagrangian in terms of the pure physical degrees of freedom , @xmath110 and @xmath114 , with the choice of the light - front gauge : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the lfqcd hamiltonian density : @xmath117           \\nonumber \\\\   & & + g\\partial^ia_a^i \\biggl (   \\frac{1}{\\,\\partial^+\\ , }    \\biggr ) \\rho_a +   \\frac{\\,g^2\\,}{2}\\biggl (   \\frac{1}{\\,\\partial^+\\ , }    \\biggr ) \\rho_a \\biggl (   \\frac{1}{\\,\\partial^+\\,}\\biggr ) \\rho_a .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we discuss the light - front quantization .",
    "a self - consistent canonical quantization requires that the resulting hamiltonian must generate the correct equations of motion for the physical degrees of freedom @xmath118 . to reproduce the lagrangian equations of motion",
    ", we need to find consistent commutators for physical field variables . in the light - front gauge ,",
    "the lfqcd phase space is spanned by the field variables , @xmath119 and their canonical momenta , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "the phase space structure which determines the poisson brackets of its variables can be found by the lagrangian one - form @xmath123 ( apart from a total light - front time derivative ) , @xmath124 where the first term on the right - hand side is called the canonical one - form of the phase space ( note that quark fields are anticommuting @xmath125-numbers ( grassmann variables ) ) .",

    "the gauge singularity is perhaps the most difficult problem in non - abelian gauge theory that has not been completely solved since it was developed . in lfqcd",
    ", it arises from the elimination of the unphysical gauge degrees of freedom . to eliminate the unphysical degrees of freedom on the light - front",
    ", we need to solve the constraint equations which depend on the definition of the operator @xmath129 . in our formulation",
    ", we define this operator by @xmath130 where @xmath131 for @xmath132 .    in perturbation theory ,",
    "the gauge singularity manifests itself clearly in momentum space .",
    "the momentum representation of eq.([1p+ ] ) is @xmath133^nf(k^+)= \\frac{1}{\\,[k^+]^n\\,}f(k^+ ) \\ , .",

    "the singularity of @xmath134 is regularized .",
    "however , with such an infrared regularization , many infrared divergences from the small longitudinal momentum , surrounding the @xmath21 region , will occurs in the perturbative calculation .",
    "we will discuss these divergences in the next lecture .    on the other hand , with the definition of eq.([1p+ ] )",
    ", we have @xmath135_{x^+=y^+ } = -i { 1\\over 4 }       \\delta_{ab}\\delta^{ij}\\ , \\epsilon(x^- - y^- ) \\delta^2      ( x_{\\bot } - y_{\\bot } ) \\ , .\\ ] ] this leads to the fact that @xmath111 satisfies an antisymmetric boundary condition : @xmath136 it also shows that the zero - mode ( the longitudinal momentum is zero ) in @xmath111 is removed .",
    "meanwhile , quarks in qcd should always be massive , namely their longitudinal momentum is not really zero .",
    "thus , with the definition of eq.([1p+ ] ) , the theory of light - front qcd does not contain zero - modes .",
    "therefore the lfqcd vacuum in this formulation is always trivial !",
    "now you may ask where is the nontrivial properties of qcd with such a trivial vacuum in your formulation ?    apparently ,",
    "after solving @xmath109 component from the light - front gauss law in the @xmath76 gauge , the gauge freedom should be completely fixed . however",
    ", a careful check shows that there is still a residual gauge transformation in the above formulation .",
    "it is given by @xmath137 which is associated with the field @xmath109 at the longitudinal infinity : @xmath138 .\\ ] ]    this gauge freedom can be further fixed for physical states .",
    "this is because the operator @xmath139 which is the longitudinal component of color electric field strength at longitudinal infinity . for physical states",
    ", finite energy density requires that the color electric field strength must vanish at the longitudinal boundary : @xmath140 .",
    "this condition canonically removes the residual gauge freedom and leads to a constraint on the @xmath111 at longitudinal infinity : @xmath141 the nontrivial properties of qcd in our formulation are indeed hidden in this condition .",
    "the main effect of this equation should be only manifested in nonperturbative dynamics , i.e. , in physical bound states .",
    "an explicit nontrivial effect can be seen form the axial anomaly of qcd , for example .",
    "consider the axial current equation ( for zero quark mass ) @xmath142 where the axial current is @xmath143 , and the dual field strength is @xmath144 .",
    "the winding number in lfqcd is defined as the net charge between @xmath145 and @xmath146 , @xmath147 the integration on the r.h.s . of the above equation",

    "] ] namely , a non - vanishing @xmath150 is generated from the asymptotic fields of @xmath111 and their antisymmetric boundary conditions at longitudinal infinity .    from the above canonical analysis",
    ", we can see that nontrivial features in lfqcd are induced by the gauge singularity and are manifested at the longitudinal infinity on the light - front .",
    "they are also associated with the light - front longitudinal infrared divergence in momentum space when the zero - modes are removed in our canonical quantization .",
    "this analysis gives us some hint where we should look for the problems in the study of nonperturbative qcd with a trivial vacuum on the light - front .",
    "when qcd is formulated on the light - front , the theory can be expressed in terms of a pure two - component form .",
    "this is another useful feature of lfqcd . after the elimination of the unphysical gauge degrees of freedom ,",
    "the qcd gauge field has already been reduced to the two transverse components , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "while , as we will see soon that the quark field can also be written in terms of a two - component field ( rather than the four - component field in instant form ) [ @xcite ] .",

    "it is the hope of the current investigation of light - front renormalization theory that the counterterms for the light - front infrared divergences may restore the broken symmetries and also provide an effective confining lfqcd hamiltonian for hadronic bound states .",
    "the rich information about electroweak and strong interactions that can be extracted from various heavy hadron decays has led to the extensive exploration of the qcd based and model - independent description of heavy hadrons in the past few years .",
    "this is mainly due to the discovery of heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry ( hqs ) in heavy meson decays by isgur and wise [ @xcite ] . for a typical example , with the hqs , all six form factors in @xmath229 and @xmath230 decays are reduced to an universal function , called the isgur - wise function , and the normalization of this universal function at the zero - recoil point provides a model - independent determination of the kabayshi - makawa matrix element @xmath231 . similarly in heavy - baryon decays , the application of hqs also leads to tremendous simplifications .    on the other hand ,",
    "heavy quark symmetry can be derived from qcd in heavy mass limit @xmath232 , via the so - called heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) [ @xcite ] .",

    "thus , the hqet offers us a new channel to explore the intrinsic properties of hadronic structure from qcd .    in order to actually compute any physical observables and make definite predictions ,",
    "one still has to confront the non - perturbative qcd dynamics .",
    "currently , except for the lattice approach , the main physical quantities , such as isgur - wise function , can only be computed in various hadronic models , such as the constituent quark model , the bag model , and qcd sum rules .",
    "it would be very interesting if one could calculate the isgur - wise function , or any hadronic form factors , directly from qcd .",
    "this requires to construct explicitly the heavy hadron bound states within the hqet , which is also necessary for a complete understanding of heavy hadron dynamics .",
    "we are motivated by such requirement to reformulate hqet on the light - front , from which we hope to consistently study the heavy hadron bound state problem [ @xcite ] . meanwhile , as we know for light quark systems , both quark confinement and spontaneously chiral symmetry breaking play an essential role to the quark dynamics in hadrons . in order to provide a nonperturbative qcd description for light quark systems ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanism for quark confinement as well as for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this will certainly make the problem most complicated .",
    "however , for heavy quark systems , chiral symmetry is explicitly broken so that confinement is the sole nontrivial feature influencing heavy quark dynamics . choosing the heavy hadron systems should be a good starting point in the study of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the light - front hqet discussed here is mainly based on the works collaborated with c. y. cheung and g. l. lin [ @xcite ] .",
    "let us begin with the qcd lagrangian for a heavy quark : @xmath237 where @xmath167 is the heavy quark field operator , @xmath233 the heavy quark mass and @xmath238 the qcd covariant derivative .    in the instant formalism",

    "the situation is quite different . before taking the heavy quark mass limit , the quark field",
    "is already divided into two parts : @xmath246 , with @xmath247 . the dirac equation for @xmath167",

    "however , for the heavy quark field with the redefinition of eq.([nlfq1 ] ) , the above problem does not occur since the elimination of the dependent component @xmath262 now depends on the operator @xmath263 which has no infrared problem .",
    "moreover , it has a well defined series expansion in powers of @xmath264 : @xmath265 thus , the heavy quark qcd lagrangian ( [ hql ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath266 alone .",
    "the complete @xmath235 expansion is given by @xmath267 where @xmath268 this is the light - front effective heavy quark lagrangian .",
    "in the symmetry limit , the light - front hqet reduces to @xmath269 which clearly exhibits the flavor and spin symmetries , because it is independent of dirac @xmath153-matrices and the heavy quark mass , as in the covariant formulation .",
    "however , beyond the symmetry limit , the light - front hqet has several advantages over the instant formulation . in the instant hqet ,",
    "the non - leading terms contain high order time - derivatives ; consequently it is difficult to perform a consistent canonical quantization beyond the limit @xmath232 [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is remarkable to see that in the light - front hqet , only linear time - derivative appears , and it resides in @xmath270 .",
    "the presence of the matrix @xmath271 in the non - leading terms eliminates all light - front time derivative terms .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in eq.([lfhqetl ] ) .",
    "thus the canonical quantization of light - front hqet is straightforward : first of all , the canonical conjugate of the dynamical variable @xmath266 is given by @xmath272 which does not involve any @xmath235 corrections . then using the light - front phase space quantization [ @xcite ]",
    ", we obtain the basic anti - commutation relation : @xmath273 which is valid to all orders in @xmath235 .",
    "the second very useful property of the light - front hqet is that the heavy quark effective hamiltonian is well defined on the light - front .",
    "from eqs.([lfhqetl ] ) and ( [ cong ] ) , we obtain the light - front heavy quark effective hamiltonian , @xmath274 with the hamiltonian density @xmath116 given by @xmath275 and @xmath276 this light - front heavy quark effective hamiltonian can serve as a basis for constructing heavy hadron bound states , as we will see in the next lecture .",
    "it is also useful for the study of the @xmath235 corrections in heavy quark dynamics .",
    "specifically , suppose we choose the light - front gauge ( @xmath261 ) in the light - front hqet , we see immediately from eq.([lfhqetl ] ) that , in the symmetry breaking terms , the power of the gluon field does not increase with that of @xmath235 .",
    "this property , which is unique to the light - front formulation , may greatly simplify our treatment of @xmath235 corrections .",
    "meanwhile , note that the non - leading light - front effective hamiltonian @xmath277 is precisely the minus of the corresponding effective lagrangian @xmath278 given by eq.([lfhqetl ] ) .",
    "this simple relation is not valid in the instant hqet , due to appearance of the high - order time - derivative terms .",
    "furthermore , since we have not chosen any specific gauge , and also there is no light - front infrared divergent problem for the heavy quark sector , short - distance qcd corrections to the heavy quark current and the effective lagrangian must be the same as those calculated in the covariant formulation .",
    "of course , an explicit calculation of the short - distance effects in the light - front hqet is needed to confirm the above statement , which has not been done as i known .",
    "the heavy quark current can also be systematically expanded in @xmath235 on the light - front . in the heavy mass limit",

    "the quantum numbers of the heavy mesons can be efficiently accounted for by the interpolating fields : @xmath284 , @xmath285 represents the fully interacting light quark ( or brown muck ) . from @xmath286 hence , in the heavy mass limit , the heavy meson decay matrix elements on the light - front take the familiar forms : @xmath287 where m is the transition matrix element for the light quark [ @xcite ] , @xmath288 thus spin symmetry implies that the transition matrix elements ( [ 27 ] ) are described by a single form factor @xmath289 , which is just the famous isgur - wise function .",
    "an explicit calculation of the isgur - wise function from light - front bound state wave function will be given in the next lecture .",
    "there are two fundamental problems in qcd for hadronic physics , the quark confinement and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "these two problems are the basis for solving the low - energy hadronic bound states from qcd but none of them has been completely understood .",
    "recently , wilson et al . proposed a new approach to determine hadronic bound states from nonperturbative qcd on the light - front with a weak - coupling treatment ( wct ) [ @xcite ] .",
    "the key to eliminating necessarily nonperturbative effects is to construct an effective qcd hamiltonian in which quarks and gluons have nonzero constituent masses rather than the zero masses of the current picture .",
    "the use of constituent masses cuts off the growth of the running coupling constant and makes it conceivable that the running coupling never leaves the perturbative domain .",
    "the wct approach potentially reconciles the simplicity of the constituent quark model with the complexities of qcd .",
    "the penalty for achieving this weak - coupling picture is the necessity of formulating the problem in light - front coordinates and of dealing with the complexities of renormalization .",
    "succinctly , this new approach of achieving a qcd description of hadronic bound states can be summarized as follows : using a new renormalization scheme , called similarity renormalization group ( srg ) scheme that is recently proposed by glazek and wilson [ @xcite ] , one can obtain an effective qcd hamiltonian @xmath290 which is a series of expansion in terms of the qcd coupling constant , where @xmath33 is a low energy scale .",
    "then one may solve from @xmath290 the strongly interacting bound states as a weak - coupling problem .",
    "the wct scheme contains the following steps : ( i ) compute explicitly from srg the @xmath290 up to the second order and denote it by @xmath291 as a nonperturbative part of @xmath290 .",
    "the remaining higher order contributions in @xmath290 are considered as a perturbative part @xmath292 .",
    "( ii ) introduce a constituent picture which allows one to start the hadronic bound states with the valence constituent fock space .",
    "the constituent quarks and gluons have masses of a few hundreds mev , and these masses are functions of the scale @xmath33 that must vanish when the effective theory goes back to the high energy region .",
    "( iii ) solve hadronic bound states with @xmath291 nonperturbatively in the constituent picture and determine the scale dependence of the constituent masses and the coupling constant .",

    "if we could show that with a suitable choice of @xmath33 at the hadronic mass scale , the effective coupling constant @xmath293 can be arbitrarily small , then wct could be applied to @xmath290 such that the corrections from @xmath292 can be truly computed perturbatively .",
    "if everything listed above works well , we may arrive at a weak - coupling qcd theory of the strong interaction for hadronic bound states .",

    "( a ) . for a single ( constituent ) quark state , the interaction part of @xmath291 does not contribute to its energy .",
    "the remaining infrared divergence from quark self - energy correction implies that the dynamical quark mass for a single quark state is infinite ( infrared divergent ) and can not be renormalized away in the spirit of gauge invariance .",

    "for color non - singlet composite states , the color factor @xmath398 in the @xmath347 interaction is different from the color factor @xmath399 .",
    "therefore , the infrared divergence in the self - energy correction also can not be cancelled by the corresponding divergence from the uncancelled instantaneous interaction . as a result ,",

    "only color singlet composite are physically observable .    finally , we argue that the above mechanism of quark confinement is indeed only true for qcd .",
    "as we have seen the light - front confinement interaction is just an effect of the non - cancellation between instantaneous interaction and one transverse gluon interaction generated in srg .",
    "such a non - cancellation arises in srg because we introduce the energy scale @xmath33 . introducing the energy scale @xmath33 in srg forces the transverse gluon energy involved in the @xmath347 effective interaction",
    "never be less than a certain value ( the energy scale @xmath33 ) .",
    "this implies that the gluon may become massive at the hadronic mass scale . of course",
    ", such a gluon mass must be a dynamical mass generated from the highly nonlinear gluon interactions .",
    "in other words , the above confining picture is indeed a dynamical consequence of non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "this confinement mechanism is not valid in qed . in qed , since photon mass is always zero , the photon energy covers the entire range from zero to infinity .",
    "thus , in qed , we can always choose the energy scale @xmath33 being zero .",
    "with @xmath401 , the infrared divergences do not occur in the electron self - energy correction . as a result , the renormalized single electron mass is finite , in contrast to the divergent mass of single quark states .",
    "for the same reason , with @xmath401 , the instantaneous interaction in the effective qed hamiltonian is also exactly cancelled by the same interaction from one transverse photon exchange so that only one photon exchange coulomb interaction remains .",

    "a numerical computation to the bound state equations , eqs.([qqbse ] ) and ( [ qqbse ] ) , is actually not too difficult .",
    "however , to have a deeper insight about the internal structure of light - front bound states , it is better to have an analytic analysis . for this propose , we would like to present a general analysis of light - front hadronic wavefunctions .",
    "the heavy hadronic wavefunctions in the heavy mass limit are rather simple .",
    "first of all , the heavy quark kinematics have already added some constraints on the general form of the light - front wavefunction @xmath431 . when we introduce the residual longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath362 for heavy quarks ,",
    "the longitudinal momentum fraction dependence in @xmath432 is quite different for the heavy - heavy , heavy - light and light - light mesons .    for the light - light mesons , such as pions , rhos , kaons etc .",
    ", the wavefunction @xmath433 must vanish at the endpoint @xmath434 or @xmath435 .",
    "this can be seen from the kinetic energy term in eq.([lfbse ] ) , where @xmath436 for the valence fock space . to ensure that the bound state equation is well defined in the entire range of momentum space ,",
    "@xmath437 must fall down to zero in the longitudinal direction not slower than @xmath438 and @xmath439 when @xmath440 and @xmath435 , respectively .",
    "in other words , at least @xmath441 . for heavy - light quark mesons , namely the @xmath345 and @xmath346 mesons ,",
    "the wavefunction @xmath442 is required to vanish at @xmath443 , where @xmath362 is the residual longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the light quark .",
    "this is because the kinetic energy in eq.([qqbse ] ) only contains a singularity at @xmath443 . on the other hand , since @xmath444 , @xmath442 should also vanish when @xmath445 .",
    "hence , a possible simple solution is @xmath446 or @xmath447 . for heavy quarkonia , @xmath448 ,",
    "the normalization forces @xmath449 to vanish as @xmath450 .",
    "thus , a simple solution may be @xmath451 .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse momentum dependence in these light - front wavefunctions should be more or less similar .",
    "they all vanish at @xmath452 .",
    "a simple form of the @xmath453 dependence for these wavefunctions is a gaussian function : @xmath454 .    the above analysis of light - front wavefunctions is only based on the kinetic energy properties of the constituents .",
    "currently , many investigations on the hadronic structures use phenomenological light - front wavefunctions .",
    "one of such wavefunctions that has been widely used in the study of heavy hadron structure is the bsw wavefunction [ @xcite ] , @xmath455,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is a normalization constant , @xmath75 a parameter of order @xmath456 , @xmath457 , and @xmath458 , @xmath459 , and @xmath460 are the hadron , quark , and antiquark masses respectively . in the heavy mass limit",
    ", the bsw wavefunction can be produced from our analysis based on the light - front bound state equations .",
    "explicitly , for heavy - light quark systems , such as the @xmath345 and @xmath346 mesons , one can easily find that in the heavy mass limit , @xmath461 , @xmath462 so that @xmath463 .",
    "meanwhile , we also have @xmath464 .",
    "furthermore , the factor @xmath465 can be rewritten by @xmath466 in according to the corresponding bound state equation discussed above .",
    "thus , the bsw wavefunction is reduced to @xmath467 this agrees with our qualitative analysis given above . indeed , using such a wavefunction",
    "we have already computed the universal isgur - wise function in @xmath468 decays [ @xcite ] : @xmath469 and from which we obtained the slope of @xmath289 at the zero - recoil point , @xmath470 , in excellent agreement with the recent clco result [ @xcite ] of @xmath471 .    for heavy quarkonia , such as the @xmath472 and @xmath473 states , @xmath474 which leads to @xmath475 in eq.([bsw ] ) .",
    "also note that @xmath476 , and the factor @xmath465 must be totally dropped as we have discussed form the quarkonium bound state equation .",
    "then the bsw wavefunction for quarkonia is reduced to @xmath477 which is a form as we expected from the qualitative analysis .",
    "here we have not taken the limit of @xmath232 for heavy quarkonia .",
    "thus a possible @xmath233 dependence in wavefunction may be hidden in the parameter @xmath75 .    using the variational approach with the above trial wave function",
    ", we can analytically solve the bound state equation eq.([qqbse ] ) . under the consideration of srg invariant for the binding energy @xmath478 , we find that the effective coupling constant [ @xcite ] : @xmath479 where the coefficients @xmath480 and @xmath481 are determined by minimizing the binding energy from ( [ qqbse ] ) with ( [ qqtwf1 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath481 is almost a constant ( with a weak dependence on @xmath233 but independence on @xmath478 and @xmath33 ) , while @xmath480 depends on both @xmath478 and @xmath233 , and also slightly on @xmath33 . for @xmath482 gev ,",
    "the @xmath33-dependence in the parameter @xmath480 is negligible .",
    "it is known that @xmath478 is of the same order as @xmath456 which is about @xmath483 mev .",
    "the charmed and bottom quark masses used here are @xmath484 gev and @xmath485 gev . from the particle data [ @xcite ] ,",
    "the binding energy @xmath478 should also be less than 400 mev . for a qualitative consideration",
    ", we may take @xmath486 gev and @xmath487 gev for charmonium .",
    "then we find that @xmath488 , and @xmath489 and @xmath490 respectively .    numerically , with @xmath491 mev and @xmath492 gev",
    ", we obtain that @xmath493 which is much smaller than that extrapolated from the canonical running coupling constant in the naive perturbative qcd calculation . in order to see how this weak",
    "coupling constant varies with the scale @xmath33 , we take @xmath494 mev and vary the value of @xmath33 around 1 gev .",
    "we find that the coupling constant is decreased very faster with increasing @xmath33 . in other words , _ with a suitable choice of the hadronic mass scale @xmath33 in srg , we can make the effective coupling constant @xmath495 in @xmath290 arbitrarily small .",
    "then the wct of nonperturbative qcd can be achieved in terms of @xmath290 such that the corrections from @xmath292 can be truly computed perturbatively_. this provides the first realization of the wct to nonperturbative qcd dynamics on the light - front .",
    "the applications of the present theory to heavy quarkonium spectroscopy and various heavy quarkonium annihilation and production processes can be simply achieved by numerically solving the bound state equations ( [ qqbse ] ) , and by further including the @xmath235 corrections ( which naturally leads to the spin splitting interactions ) .",
    "the extension of the computations to heavy - light quark systems is straightforward .",
    "the extension of the present work to light - light hadrons requires the understanding of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd which is a new challenge to nonperturbative qcd on the light - front .",
    "nevertheless , we have provided a detailed analysis to the weak - coupling treatment of nonperturbative qcd proposed recently [ @xcite ] .",
    "i believe that lfqcd opens a new research direction in the attempt of solving the most difficult problem in field theory , that is , the problem of the relativistic composite particle bound states governed by the nonperturbative dynamics of qcd .",
