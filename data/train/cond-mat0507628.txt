    "as is known , in many - body systems the density of energy levels increases extremely fast with an excitation energy . as a result , for highly excited states even a very weak interaction between particles can lead to a strong mixing between the unperturbed basis states , resulting in a complex structure of exact eigenstates . in this case",
    "one can speak about _ chaotic eigenstates _ since their components can be practically treated as pseudo - random ones . in the dynamics",
    ", this fact results in a relaxation of the system to a steady - state distribution .",
    "the studies of complex atoms @xcite , multi - charged ions @xcite , nuclei @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , and spin systems @xcite have confirmed the dynamical origin of statistical laws in isolated systems ( see , also , refs . @xcite and the review @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the theory of many - body chaos has been extended to the models of a quantum computation .",
    "in particular , it was argued that due to a very high density of energy levels , any kind of perturbation may lead to decoherence effects thus destroying the operability of a quantum computer .",
    "therefore , it is of importance to search for the conditions when the role of chaos can be significantly reduced @xcite .",
    "so far , the study of the many - body chaos has been mainly restricted by the investigation of statistical properties of the energy spectra and eigenstates . on the other hand , in view of experimental applications , one needs to know what are the _ dynamical _ properties of quantum systems with strongly interacting particles .",
    "below , we analyze the time dependence of the widely used quantity , the so - called return probability which determines global properties of the dynamics .",
    "our main interest is in the interplay between the exponential and gaussian decrease of the return probability , in dependence on the strength of the interaction between particles .",
    "in what follows we consider physical systems described by the total hamiltonian @xmath0 which can written in the separable form , @xmath1 typically , such a representation is used when studying the influence of a perturbation @xmath2 on a system governed by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath3 . in many physical applications",
    "this form of @xmath0 is quite natural , reflecting a different nature of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , quite often the separation of @xmath0 into the two parts is not well defined , as in the case of mean field approaches used to introduce  good \" variables in which @xmath3 has a relatively simple form in comparison with a  residual interaction \" @xmath2 . in what follows",
    "we discuss some of generic properties of the dynamics of the model ( [ h ] ) , by studying specific forms of the hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "it is naturally to represent @xmath0 in the unperturbed basis @xmath4 of @xmath3 .",
    "then the total hamiltonian is presented by the sum of the diagonal matrix @xmath3 plus the perturbation matrix @xmath2 with the matrix elements @xmath5 . in order to consider the evolution of wave packets in the basis of @xmath3 , one has to express _ exact _ eigenstates @xmath6 of the total hamiltonian @xmath0 in terms of _ basis _ states @xmath7 of @xmath3 , @xmath8 the coefficients",
    "@xmath9 give the expansion of an exact state in terms of the basis states ( for @xmath10 fixed ) , or the expansion of a basis state in terms of the exact states ( for @xmath11 fixed ) . in principle , the knowledge of the state matrix @xmath12 and the corresponding energy spectrum @xmath13 gives a complete information about the system .",
    "of particular interest is the case when the initial state @xmath14 is a basis state @xmath15 .",
    "then the evolution of the @xmath16function is described by the expression , @xmath17 here and below we assume that @xmath18 .",
    "as one can see , the probability @xmath19 to find the system at time @xmath20 in the state @xmath4 is determined by the amplitude @xmath21    our main interest is in the _ return probability _",
    "@xmath22 which is the probability to find the system at time @xmath20 in the initial state @xmath15 .",
    "one can see that the return probability is determined by the expression , @xmath23 where @xmath24 here we replaced the summation by integration that can be done if the number of large components @xmath25 is large .",
    "indeed , these components strongly fluctuate around their mean values and quite often can be considered as pseudo - random quantities .",
    "in fact , this condition of a large number of pseudo - random components in exact eigenstates can be used as the definition of chaos in quantum systems ( for details , see refs.@xcite ) . in this case , the time dependence of @xmath22 is entirely determined by the fourier transform of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the energy of exact eigenstates and @xmath28 is the energy corresponding to the unperturbed state @xmath15 .",
    "this quantity is known in the literature as the _ strength function _ ( sf ) or _ local spectral density of states _",
    ", @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the density of states of the total hamiltonian @xmath0 , and the average is performed over a number of states with energies close to @xmath27 .    to analyze generical properties of the return probability , let us start with its behavior at small times .",
    "according to the perturbation theory , one can easily get the general expression , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the variance of the strength function in the unperturbed energy space , determined as @xmath33 note that the above expression is universal in the sense that it is exact for any kind of the perturbation @xmath2 .",
    "practically , the initial time scale for the perturbative expression ( [ smallt ] ) to be valid is very small , and the main interest is in the time - dependence of @xmath22 beyond this time scale .",
    "in order to analyze the behavior of @xmath22 on a large time scale , we consider the model which describes a closed system of @xmath34 fermi - particles occupying @xmath35 _ single - particle _ levels of energies @xmath36 . the total hamiltonian can be represented in the form ( [ h ] ) where @xmath37 here @xmath3 stands for non - interacting particles , and the interaction @xmath2 between the particles is expressed in terms of two - body matrix elements @xmath38 .",
    "the many - particle basis @xmath4 of @xmath3 is defined by the slater determinant , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the creation - annihilation operators , and @xmath42 is the ground state .",
    "as one can see , the interaction between particles is assumed to have a two - body nature , therefore , each many - particle matrix element @xmath5 is a sum of a number of two - body matrix elements @xmath38 involving at most four single - particle states @xmath43 ( for details , see , for instance , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "note that the approach we consider here , is also valid for quasi - particles that appear in the mean - field theories . in this case",
    "@xmath3 stands for the mean - field part of the hamiltonian , and @xmath2 describes a residual interaction .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath0 in the form ( [ h0v ] ) describes generic properties of such physical systems as complex atoms , nuclei , quantum dots , etc .",
    "the energies @xmath44 in such applications are , in fact , renormalized quasi - particle energies .    in many realistic applications",
    "the interaction @xmath2 between particles ( quasi - particles ) is so strong and complicated that practically one can describe such an interaction by assuming that all _ two - body _ matrix elements are distributed randomly according to some distribution .",
    "thus , the simplest version of the two - body random interaction model ( tbri ) is the hamiltonian ( [ h0v ] ) in which all matrix elements @xmath38 are random gaussian numbers with the zero mean and the variance @xmath45 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the _ many - body _ matrix elements @xmath46 are , however , weakly correlated , due to the fact that the same two - body matrix elements enter in different _ many - body _ matrix elements @xmath46 . in general",
    ", these correlations can be neglected , however , for specific observables they give rise to unexpected results ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .    without the loss of generality one can assume that the single - particle spectrum has the constant mean level spacing , @xmath47 ; here the brackets @xmath48 stand for the average over random values of @xmath36 .",
    "the number of many - body states increases very fast with an increase of the number of particles @xmath34 and number @xmath35 of single - particles states .",
    "for this reason even for a relatively small number of particles the exact eigenstates may consist of many unperturbed basis states , thus providing us with a possibility to use statistical methods .",
    "in particular , a novel approach has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that is based on the chaotic structure of eigenstates in a given basis of unperturbed many - particle states .",
    "this approach allows one to relate statistical properties of exact eigenstates in many - body representation directly to the properties of single - particle operators , such as the occupation number distribution of single - particle states .",
    "as was shown above , the time dependence of the return probability is entirely determined by the fourier transform of the sf . in many applications the sf",
    "is known to have the breit - wigner ( bw ) form ( or , the same , the lorentzian ) resulting from the application of the random matrix theory , ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "the half - width @xmath49 of the bw is given by the fermi golden rule and in our case reads as @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the mean square value of many - body matrix elements ( obtained by the average over @xmath11 ) , and @xmath52 is the density of those states which are directly coupled to the basis state @xmath15 by the interaction @xmath2 .",
    "note that this density @xmath52 is much smaller than total density @xmath53 of all many - body states .",
    "this fact is manifested by a large number of zero matrix elements for any fixed line in the hamiltonian matrix @xmath54 .",
    "it should be stressed that the above result for the bw form of the sf is based on a non - perturbative approach according to which a large number of many - body states are coupled by a relatively strong interaction . as a result , the decrease of the return probability has the exponential time dependence , @xmath55 apart from a small time scale @xmath56 on which the quadratic decrease ( [ smallt ] ) occurs .",
    "for a long time it was assumed that the exponential decrease of the return probability is the only regime which is physically relevant to the dynamics of systems with many interacting particles .",
    "however , recently it was found that in many situations the form of the sf can be quite close to the gaussian ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this fact is related to a finite width @xmath57 of the interaction in the energy space for isolated systems . for the tbri model",
    "it was shown @xcite that if @xmath49 is much less than @xmath57 , the form of the sf , is , indeed , the bw . however , in the other limit , @xmath58 , of a very strong interaction , the leading dependence of @xmath22 is the gaussian , @xmath59 and occurs on a time scale @xmath60 .",
    "after , for @xmath61 , the decay of @xmath22 is described by the exponential function @xcite .",
    "the transition from the bw to the gaussian for the tbri model has been analyzed in ref.@xcite , although the analytical expression in a closed form is unknown . in order to evaluate @xmath22 , in ref.@xcite a phenomenological expression",
    "was suggested that depends on both parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath62 .",
    "the analytical expression for the variance @xmath32 of the strength function can be found explicitly @xcite , @xmath63 here @xmath64 $ ] is the range within which the two - body matrix elements are distributed randomly with a constant probability , therefore , @xmath65 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for fermi - particles the variance @xmath32 turns out to be independent of a specific basis state @xmath66 .",
    "thus , in the case of a not very strong perturbation the decrease of the return probability is the exponential one , and with an increase of the interaction @xmath2 , one should expect a quite large time scale on which the gaussian form ( [ gau ] ) occurs .",
    "let us check these predictions by making use of numerical data . in all our calculations we have used @xmath67 fermi - particles occupying @xmath68 single - particle states ; this results in the size @xmath69 of the hamiltonian matrix . for simplicity ,",
    "the initially excited state was taken at the center of the energy spectrum , @xmath70 , where the density of many - body states is maximal , and the energy spectrum is symmetrical .    for a relatively weak ( however , non - perturbative ) interaction , @xmath71 , the data , indeed , demonstrate a clear exponential dependence , up to some time scale beyond which the finite size effects of the hamiltonian matrix are important ,",
    "see fig.1 .",
    "the fit to the exponential dependence ( [ lor ] ) gives @xmath72 . to compare with the analytical expression ( [ gamma0 ] ) , one should note that for the tbri model this expression is difficult to use directly , since the quantity @xmath73 is not well - defined by eq.([gamma0 ] ) .",
    "the problem is that the density of directly coupled many - body states strongly changes in dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "the rough estimate can be obtained as follows .",
    "first , one can relate the term @xmath74 to @xmath32 in the way , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the number of non - zero elements in any line of the hamiltonian matrix ( which is independent of @xmath77 @xcite ) .",
    "second , the simplest estimate of the mean density @xmath78 is due to the average width @xmath57 of the interaction in the energy space , @xmath79 . as a result ,",
    "one gets , @xmath80 finally , it can be shown that the simplest estimate for the width of the interaction reads as @xmath81 .",
    "this gives @xmath82 which is a good result , taking into account the problems with the evaluation of the expression for @xmath49 .",
    "now let us consider another limit case of a very strong interaction , @xmath83 , when the sf is quite close to the gaussian .",
    "numerical data reported in fig.2 manifest a long gaussian decrease of the return probability . note that the deviation from the gaussian dependence towards the exponential one ( linear slope in fig.2 after @xmath84 ) starts for very small values of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , practically the decrease of the return probability is described by the dependence ( [ gau ] ) .",
    "finally , we conclude with the intermediate case when both dependencies , ( [ gau ] ) and ( [ lor ] ) , are important for the description of the return probability . in fig.3",
    "one can see that there are two time scales . on the first time scale",
    ", @xmath85 , the decrease of @xmath22 has the gaussian form ( [ gau ] ) , and for @xmath86 it changes to the exponential dependence .",
    "it is now instructive to analyze the critical time @xmath87 which divides these two regimes , @xmath88 one can see that @xmath87 is the time to resolve the finiteness of the width of the interaction .",
    "if this width is very large , the exponential decrease starts on a small time scale .",
    "contrary , for relatively small values of @xmath57 the gaussian decrease of @xmath22 starts from @xmath89 and lasts for a long time .",
    "according to this estimate , we have @xmath90 which roughly corresponds to the data .",
    "note that the critical time @xmath87 is , in fact , not a well defined quantity and can be determined up to some numerical factor of the order one .",
    "remarkably , the time of the correspondence of the data to eq.([gau ] ) turns out to be independent of the perturbation strength .",
    "it is instructive to apply the above analysis to the so - called wigner band random matrices ( wbrm ) .",
    "these matrices are very useful for understanding generic properties of realistic physical systems of interacting particles .",
    "the wbrm model is described by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) which consists of two parts , one of which is a diagonal matrix @xmath3 with increasing entries @xmath91 .",
    "this part can be treated as the  mean field \" part of the total hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "another part is a banded matrix @xmath92 , which is associated with the interaction between unperturbed basis states .",
    "thus , the model has the following form , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the delta - function .",
    "it is assumed that random values @xmath95 with the mean spacing @xmath96 are reordered in an increasing way , @xmath97 . as for the off - diagonal matrix elements",
    "@xmath92 , they are distributed according to the gaussian distribution ( with the zero mean , @xmath98 , and the variance @xmath99 ) for the matrix elements inside the finite band @xmath100 , and zero otherwise .",
    "these matrices have been introduced by wigner in ref.@xcite in application to nuclear physics .",
    "a particular interest was the form of the strength function in dependence on the strength of the interaction @xmath2 .",
    "it was shown that the form of the sf is the bw for a moderate ( non - perturbative ) strength @xmath2 , and the semicircle for a very strong perturbation .",
    "full analytical treatment of the form of the sf for eq.([wbrm ] ) is given in ref.@xcite with the use of the modern approach .",
    "in particular , it was found that in the transition from the bw to the semicircle , the form of the sf is very close to the gaussian .",
    "the condition for the sf to be of the breit - wigner form in the wbrm model can be written as follows @xcite , @xmath101 where the half - width @xmath102 is given by the fermi golden rule , @xmath103 and @xmath57 is the energy width of the interaction @xmath2 .",
    "the left part of the inequalities in eq.([range1 ] ) indicates the non - perturbative situation for which many of unperturbed basis states are strongly coupled by the interaction . on the other hand",
    ", the interaction should not be very strong , namely , the width @xmath49 determined by eq .",
    "( [ bwgam ] ) , has to be less than the width @xmath57 of the interaction in the energy representation .",
    "the latter condition is generic for systems with finite range of the interaction @xmath2 .",
    "one should stress that , strictly speaking , the bw form of the strength function is not correct in physical applications since its second moment diverges ( which assumes an infinite range of the interaction ) . for the wbrm model with finite values of @xmath104",
    "it was shown @xcite that far off the energy range @xmath105 the sf decreases faster than a pure exponent .",
    "in contrast with the tbri model , in the wbrm model the energy scale @xmath57 is well defined that simplifies our further analysis .",
    "one can see that instead of the control parameter @xmath57 , one can equivalently use the variance @xmath106 of the sf , which can be expressed through the off - diagonal matrix elements of the interaction , @xmath107 for @xmath108 , therefore , @xmath109 . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath110 and the relation ( [ range1 ] ) can be written in the form , @xmath111    numerical data for the wbrm model have confirmed that for @xmath112 the form of the sf is quite close to the gaussian .",
    "moreover , it was found that the transition from the bw dependence to the gaussian - like is very sharp .",
    "note that the extreme limit of a very strong interaction , @xmath113 , seems to be non - physical , giving rise to the semicircle form of the sf .",
    "the same effect occurs for the tbri model for which the relation @xmath114 means that the residual interaction is much stronger than the mean field part .    applying the arguments",
    "given for the tbri model , the gaussian decrease of the sf has the form , @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "numerical data in fig.3 obtained for @xmath118 and different model parameters , are in a good correspondence with our analysis .",
    "first , the time dependence of @xmath22 on the time scale @xmath119 is , indeed , of the gaussian form ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "second , the critical time which divides the two characteristic dependencies , nicely corresponds to the expression @xmath120 .",
    "as one can see , the transition from the gaussian to the exponential decrease is a quite generic property of the wave packet dynamics in the systems which are described by the tbri or wbrm models .",
    "now we apply our analysis to a physical model of quantum computation which has no random parameters .",
    "although a direct application of the results obtained for random matrix models to the dynamical models is not justified , it is of interest to see whether such a comparison is possible .",
    "the model we consider here was recently proposed @xcite as a simple realization of a solid - state quantum computation .",
    "it describes a one - dimensional chain of @xmath121 interacting @xmath122-spins ( qubits ) that are subject to an external magnetic field . in order to have selective resonant excitation ,",
    "the time independent part @xmath123 of a magnetic field is assumed to have a constant gradient along the @xmath124-direction .",
    "this provides different larmor frequencies for different spins , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the spin gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath127 is proportional to the gradient of the constant part of the magnetic field ( see details in @xcite ) .    for a specific pulse of the time - dependent part of the magnetic field , resulting in a single cubit operation",
    ", one can derive the time - independent hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with @xmath128 \\,;\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\",
    ", v= - \\sum_{k=0}^{l-1 } \\omega i^x_k,\\ ] ] where @xmath129 @xcite . here the frequency @xmath130 is the rabi frequency of the @xmath131-th pulse , @xmath132 with @xmath133 as the pauli matrices , and @xmath134 .",
    "it is also assumed that the interaction @xmath135 between nearest qubits does not depend on the indexes @xmath11 and @xmath136 .",
    "the unperturbed basis ( in which @xmath3 is diagonal ) is reordered according to an increase of the index @xmath137 which is written in the binary representation , @xmath138 ( with @xmath139 or @xmath140 , depending on whether the single - particle state of the @xmath141th qubit is the ground state or the excited one ) .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath130 corresponds to a non - diagonal coupling , thus , determining the matrix elements @xmath142 with @xmath143 .",
    "as one can see , in contrast with the tbri model discussed above , in the chosen representation the interaction between particles is absorbed by @xmath3 , and @xmath2 describes the coupling to the external magnetic field .",
    "the problem studied in refs.@xcite was the analysis of whether the inter - qubit interaction , as well as the interaction of qubits with the external magnetic field , can be a source of a kind of internal decoherence caused by quantum chaos .",
    "it is a wide - spread concern that for many interacting qubits the onset of quantum chaos may occur even for a very weak interaction , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "this expectation is based on the fact that with an increase of number of qubits the level density of many - body states increases drastically , thus strongly enhancing the delocalization effects due to the interaction between qubits .",
    "the simple estimate @xcite shows that generically the threshold for the onset of chaos decreases as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is a critical inter - qubit interaction above which the eigenstates are extended over unperturbed many - body states .",
    "however , as was found in refs.@xcite , in the case of an external magnetic field with a constant gradient along the chain of qubits , the onset of chaos is strongly suppressed .",
    "although in this case the total energy width may be large ( proportional to @xmath121 ) , the estimate @xcite shows a feasibility of an experimental realization for a quite large number of qubits . another principally different scheme that allows to avoid strong delocalization / chaos effects ,",
    "is suggested and analyzed in refs.@xcite for a quantum computer based on electrons on helium .",
    "our interest below is to see whether the results for the return probability , obtained above in terms of random matrix models , can be applied to the dynamical model ( [ hv ] ) .",
    "note that a strong decrease of the return probability @xmath22 can serve as an effective measure of a stability of a quantum computation .",
    "it can be shown that the delocalization effects are directly governed by the time - dependence of @xmath22 .",
    "strictly speaking , the effectiveness of a quantum computation should be analyzed for the time - dependent model with a large number of pulses . however ,",
    "if for a single pulse the effects of quantum chaos are strong , they will be generically enhanced in the presence of many pulses .",
    "this is why below we restrict ourselves by a consideration of the simplified time - independent hamiltonian ( [ hv ] ) .",
    "we hope that our analysis may have also an interest in view of general problems of the dynamics of systems with a large number of interacting spins .",
    "first , we start with the so - called _ non - selective _ regime which is defined by the conditions , @xmath146 .",
    "this inequality provides the simplest way to prepare a homogeneous superposition of @xmath147 many - body states , which is needed to start with the implementation of the shor s or grover s algorithm .",
    "the analytical and numerical treatment of the model ( [ hv ] ) in this regime has revealed @xcite that the constant gradient magnetic field ( with @xmath148 ) strongly reduces unwanted effects of quantum chaos .",
    "specifically , it was shown that in this case the chaos border turns out to be independent of the number @xmath121 of qubits , in contrast to the models thoroughly studied before @xcite .",
    "in particular , the quantum chaos may occur only for a large coupling @xmath130 and strong interaction @xmath135 between qubits .",
    "another new effect which was found in refs.@xcite , is that the border of quantum chaos does not coincide with the border of delocalization .",
    "this peculiarity is important in view of applications to integrable or nearly integrable models for which the quantum chaos is absent , however , the delocalization effects can be very strong .    as was shown in refs.@xcite in the non - selective regime with @xmath149 ,",
    "the delocalization effects start to play essential role for @xmath150 . on the other hand , the quantum chaos effects , such as the wigner - dyson distribution for the spectra statistics ,",
    "occurs for @xmath151 . since in this case",
    "both the inter - qubit interaction and the perturbation due to the magnetic field are strong , one can analyze the dynamics of the return probability @xmath22 in connection with the previously discussed results .    numerical data presented in fig.5 show a strong decrease of @xmath22 for three values of @xmath135 . as one can see , in all cases the return probability decreases similar to the gaussian form of eq.([gau ] ) .",
    "the correspondence with theoretical predictions should be treated as a good one , taking into account the dynamical character of the considered model .",
    "it is important that the perturbation @xmath130 due to the magnetic field is strong , therefore , the results are almost insensitive to the inter - qubit interaction in a very wide region of @xmath135 .",
    "now we analyze the regime of _ selective excitation _ which is characterized by the following range of parameters , @xmath152 . in this regime",
    "each pulse acts selectively on a chosen qubit thus resulting in a resonant transition . in ref.@xcite",
    "this regime was analyzed in detail with the main interest to the fidelity of some quantum protocol ( for the time - dependent hamiltonian with many pulses ) .",
    "it was shown that in this regime for a relatively large gradient of the magnetic field there is no any danger of quantum chaos , and the dynamics can be analyzed on the base of the perturbation theory .",
    "it is instructive now to see how the return probability @xmath22 corresponds to these results .",
    "in fig.6 we present numerical data demonstrating the dependence of @xmath153 for some time @xmath154 .",
    "first , one can see that for small values of @xmath127 the perturbation turns out to be very strong , leading to a strong decrease of @xmath153 .",
    "this result demonstrates that even a small interaction between qubits gives rise to a strong leakage of the probability from an initially excited state .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is the degeneracy ( for @xmath155 ) or quasi - degeneracy ( for small @xmath127 ) . with an increase of the gradient of the magnetic field ,",
    "the dynamics turns out to be very stable , as is manifested by the values of @xmath156 close to one .",
    "the analytical estimate of the critical value of the inter - qubit coupling above which the fidelity is very high , was found @xcite to be @xmath157 . our data ,",
    "however , clearly show a slightly different value @xmath158 .",
    "a more careful inspection of the numerical data of ref.@xcite confirms that , indeed , the fidelity starts to decrease at smaller than @xmath159 values .",
    "our data in fig.5 also reveal a quite interesting resonance effect that occurs for specific values @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "this effect has the same origin as that found in ref.@xcite .    in order to see more clearly the role of the gradient magnetic field",
    ", we performed an additional check of the time dependence of the return probability for small , @xmath162 , and large , @xmath163 , values of @xmath127 .",
    "the results in fig.7 manifest a very different behavior of the return probability for these two representative values .",
    "if for the small value of @xmath127 the decrease of @xmath22 is very fast and seems to be non - recurrent , for large @xmath163 the return probability remains very close to one and shows a clear recurrence .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath162 one can see two regimes , the gaussian one ( for @xmath164 , and the exponential one ( for @xmath165 ) .",
    "note that due to a specific character of the selective excitation ( quasi - degeneracy for @xmath162 and very weak perturbation for @xmath163 ) , the comparison with the discussed above analytical estimates in this case is not valid .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the return probability @xmath22 in three models of strongly interacting particles .",
    "the first model is the model with random two - body interaction , typically used to describe the many - body systems of fermi - particles such as heavy nuclei , many - electron atoms , quantum dots , etc . as usual",
    ", the two - body random matrix elements are assumed to be gaussian random entries , which is known to be reasonable when the interaction is strong and has a complicated form .",
    "the main result of our analytical and numerical study is that with an increase of the interaction , the gaussian decrease of the return probability can last for a long time .",
    "the typical picture is the following : on some time scale @xmath166 the decrease of @xmath22 is the gaussian , and for @xmath86 it is the exponential one",
    ". the gaussian decrease on the scale @xmath167 can be either weak or strong , depending whether the interaction is strong or very strong .",
    "thus , the standard exponential decrease , associated with the fermi golden rule , is not correct for a very strong perturbation .",
    "numerical data confirm the analytical predictions .    in order to elucidate the meaning of our analytical estimates",
    ", we have also analyzed the model of wigner band random matrices which captures essential features of the chaotic systems of interacting particles .",
    "this model turns out to be very effective since it demonstrates in a very transparent way the dependence of the dynamics on few global parameters of physical significance .",
    "our numerical data reflect the generic properties of the interplay between the gaussian and exponential decrease of the return probability .",
    "finally , we have analyzed the model which was recently proposed as an implementation of a quantum computer . in contrast with the random matrix models , this model is purely dynamical one ( without any random parameters ) .",
    "as is now well understood , the effects of quantum chaos and/or delocalization may also arise in the models of quantum computation , and lead to a kind of internal decoherence .",
    "our numerical data show that in the region of parameters that corresponds to a strong delocalization and quantum chaos , the return probability has the gaussian form of the decay for a quite a long time , similar to what occurs in the random matrix models .",
    "additional study of the role of a non - zero gradient magnetic field has shown that the fast decrease of the return probability corresponds to earlier results for the fidelity of some quantum protocol with many pulses .",
    "therefore , the return probability can be considered as a quite sensitive quantity for establishing the region of parameters where one can expect stable operability of quantum computers .",
