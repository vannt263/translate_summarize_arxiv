    "ambient pressure calorimetry is a classical tool for condensed matter studies .",
    "the knowledge of specific heat and its temperature dependence provides information on the type of solid  state excitations and on phase transitions .",
    "extending the standard methods to high pressures ( up to @xmath3  gpa ) is a rather difficult and experimentally challenging task . in a high pressure study ,",
    "tiny samples are embedded in a pressure transmitting medium .",
    "this assembly is enclosed in a pressure cell .",
    "the unavoidable thermal contact between sample and environment leads to heat leakage problems in conventional calorimetric techniques .",
    "if the heat capacity of the empty high pressure device is known , the heat capacity of the sample under pressure can be determined by subtraction  @xcite . as this will work in practice",
    "only if the sample contributes a considerable part to the total heat capacity , the choice of samples is restricted .    in the present work",
    "we report how the ac  technique  @xcite can be used to determine the specific heat at low temperature and high pressure .",
    "indeed , this technique is known to be well suited to the high pressure environment @xcite since it does not require adiabatic conditions , and allows high resolution , even on very small samples . however , absolute accuracy is generally difficult to obtain .",
    "two different sample arrangements within the clamped high pressure device were tested .",
    "ceru@xmath4ge@xmath4 was chosen as the sample . at ambient pressure",
    "it shows two magnetic phase transitions @xcite which give rise to large signatures in the specific heat ( @xmath5  and 0.5  j / molk@xmath6 at the curie @xmath7 and neel temperature @xmath8 , respectively ) .",
    "the pressure dependence of the transition temperatures is known from transport measurements @xcite .",
    "thus , ceru@xmath9ge@xmath4  is a good candidate for testing the ac ",
    "calorimetric technique at high pressure .",
    "it is expected that specific heat can provide additional information on the magnetic phase transitions .",
    "the principle of ac  calorimetry is described in ref .",
    "figure  [ fig : schema](a ) shows a simplified model : the sample is ther-    mally excited by a ac  heater , and the amplitude of the temperature oscillations @xmath10 is measured . in the ideal case , when the heat capacity of thermometer , heater , and heat link are negligible and when the coupling between heater , sample , and thermometer is ideal , @xmath10 depends    only on the working frequency @xmath11 , the specific heat of the sample @xmath12 , and the global heat link @xmath13 , through the equation : @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 the mean heater power . when working above the cut - off frequency @xmath17 , @xmath10 is inversely proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "the possibility of tuning both the amplitude and the frequency of the excitation is the main advantage of this technique ; as long as @xmath13 can be made small enough , the sensitivity of the measurement does not depend on the mass of the sample .",
    "the real case of a sample in a pressure cell is far from this ideal one .",
    "in particular the specific heat of the pressure transmitting medium has to be taken into account as was done by baloga and garland  @xcite .",
    "however , the general behaviour of eq.([eq : tac ] ) can be recovered if the product @xmath19 ( volumic specific heat times heat conductivity ) of the pressure transmitting medium is negligible with respect to that of the sample  @xcite .",
    "if so , the heat wave does not propagate too far into the medium ( @xmath20 small ) and the specific heat of the temperature oscillating medium does not contribute too much ( @xmath21 small ) . hence , thermal properties of the pressure transmitting medium determine the working conditions .",
    "calorimetric measurements were performed in a clamped high pressure device able to reach @xmath22  10  gpa . sample preparation and details of the high pressure cell are given in ref .",
    "an important point for specific heat measurements is the fact that the samples are embedded in steatite , the pressure transmitting medium .",
    "figure  [ fig : schema](b ) shows schematically the inner part of the high pressure cell in detail .",
    "the typical thicknesses of the sample , thermocouple and heating wire are 20 , 12 , and 3  @xmath23 m , respectively .",
    "two different ways of supplying the heat to the samples were tested . for sample  a a thin electrical insulation ( 45  @xmath23 m of an epoxy / al@xmath4o@xmath24 mixture ) prevents electrical contact with the heater but still allows a good thermal contact .",
    "sample b is set apart on a metallic ( pb ) foil , electrically ( and thus thermally ) linked to the heater through a gold wire . no heating current passes through this sample .",
    "temperature oscillations should be small compared to the sample temperature and were chosen in the range 2  mk  @xmath25  20  mk .",
    "this gives thermovoltages of @xmath22  100  nv , which were amplified at room temperature in two stages ( @xmath26  500 ) and finally read by a lock  in amplifier .",
    "we used frequencies between 500 and 4000  hz .",
    "the noise after amplification was 0.15  @xmath23v peak  peak , i.e. 0.75  nv@xmath27  rms , referred to the thermocouple input taking into account the amplification and settings of the lock  in amplifier .",
    "this is not far from the johnson noise ( 0.3  nv@xmath27  rms ) of the connecting wires ( 5  @xmath28 at 300  k ) .",
    "the typical thermopower @xmath29 of the thermocouple is 10  @xmath23v / k , which gives a temperature noise for the sample of 30  @xmath23k peak  peak ; to reach a sensitivity of 1% in the determination of @xmath12 , the sample should have a temperature oscillation @xmath30  3  mk .",
    "the resistivity of the pb manometer was measured by the four point technique at 72  hz .",
    "the current excitation was low ( 5  @xmath23a ) to avoid local heating .",
    "in order to confirm that the signal truly reflects the heat capacity , it should obey the frequency dependence described by the general formula given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "however , the simplified eq.([eq : tac ] ) describes well the signal as can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1eremesure ] . at low temperature ( 4.2  k ) and",
    "pressure ( 0.7  gpa ) the cut - off frequency is @xmath22  450  hz ; the working frequency was chosen to be slightly higher , keeping in mind that the signal decreases with @xmath11 .",
    "changing the temperature and the pressure influences the cut - off frequency : from 1 to 4  k we worked in the range 6001000  hz , and from 4 to 12  k between 2000 and 4000  hz .",
    "the specific heat of the sample is certainly the main contribution to the signal .",
    "this follows implicitly from the fact that the frequency dependence is well described by eq.([eq : tac ] ) without any correction .",
    "however , a convincing argument is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1eremesure ] , where the specific heat measured at ambient and low pressure ( 0.7  gpa ) are compared .",
    "the former curve was obtained with a conventional relaxation technique using a comparatively large sample ( 14  mg )  @xcite whereas the investigated samples each had a mass of @xmath22  10  @xmath23 g .",
    "the phase transitions are clearly visible .",
    "they are also detectable with the ac  technique at 0.7  gpa , but slightly shifted in temperature as expected from the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the height of the specific heat jump at the second order transition ( @xmath31  9  k ) represents 47% of the total signal compared to 51% for the ambient pressure curve .",
    "this indicates that the heat capacity measured under pressure is in majority the heat capacity of the sample .    the first order transition ( @xmath32  7  k ) is not a good reference for such a comparison .",
    "the height of its peak is very sensitive to any distribution of @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , ac ",
    "calorimetry is not the proper tool to measure a latent heat  @xcite , since it only detects the reversible part at frequency @xmath11 on a temperature scale @xmath10",
    ". the apparent latent heat may be smaller if part of the system is irreversible at the given frequency .",
    "the size of the peak can depend strongly on the operating conditions  @xcite .",
    "this explains the different behaviour at @xmath7 since the relaxation technique used at zero pressure  @xcite is not subject to this restriction .",
    "however , the position of a first order transition can be detected by an ac ",
    "calorimeter .",
    "this setup allows the specific heat of samples under pressure to be measure almost without any addenda , therefore no background has to be subtracted .",
    "but there are two main limitations :",
    "( i ) the temperature of the samples is measured with thermocouples , with the assumption that their calibration does not change under pressure . hence , the quantitative comparison of data at different pressures is limited .",
    "however , the relative uncertainty of data obtained in a narrow pressure range remains small .",
    "( ii ) the total amount of power supplied to the samples is not known precisely , although a joule heater was used .",
    "the measurements were done under the assumption that the heat power received by the samples does not change with pressure .",
    "these limitations presently do not allow the acquisition of absolute values for the specific heat , so we have to rely on a separate measurement done at zero pressure .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d ] shows @xmath33 versus @xmath34 curves of ceru@xmath9ge@xmath4  at different pressures and the derived ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) phase diagram .",
    "the evolution of the anomalies in @xmath33 can be followed up to high pressure ( @xmath36  gpa ) for the first time .",
    "results for sample a ( insulated from the heater and on top of it ) and sample b ( connected to the heater but set farther away ) at low ( @xmath37  gpa ) and high pressure , respectively , were used for this figure .",
    "indeed , both samples show almost identical results , but present small differences which explain this choice .",
    "the anomalies in sample b tend to be @xmath22  10% smaller ( depending on pressure and temperature ) since the heat capacity of the metallic foil contributes to the measured signal , too . on the other hand ,",
    "the anomalies of the specific heat of sample a tend to be broader , probably due to a deviation from hydrostatic pressure conditions , especially at higher pressure .",
    "the phase diagram obtained compares well with that deduced from transport measurements @xcite .",
    "the neel temperature first increases with pressure up to @xmath38  k ( at @xmath39  gpa ) and then decreases .",
    "in contrast to this , the curie temperature decreases with pressure and vanishes around 2  gpa . above that pressure",
    "ceru@xmath9ge@xmath4  enters a differently ordered magnetic groundstate below a characteristic temperature @xmath40  k. this transition temperature increases up to @xmath41  k ( at @xmath42  gpa ) .",
    "magnetic order seems to be suppressed below 1.5  k in the pressure range @xmath43  gpa . in this interval",
    "the anomaly related to @xmath8 becomes weaker and the overall shape of the @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 curves changes .",
    "hence , a critical pressure @xmath44  gpa is inferred .",
    "this value is in agreement with the one deduced from transport measurements ( electrical resistivity @xcite , thermoelectrical power @xcite ) performed at temperatures above 1.5  k. electrical resistivity measurements carried out down to 30  mk and 60  mk yield @xmath45  gpa  @xcite and 10  gpa @xcite , respectively .",
    "these differences are probably due to the influence of sample quality  on a microscopic scale  even though the samples investigated here are taken from the same ingot as those used in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 dependence can be compared qualitatively with the doniach phase diagram @xcite which describes the competition between the kondo effect and the rkky interaction . at low pressures ,",
    "the latter overcomes the kondo effect .",
    "as the non - magnetic phase boundary is reached , the magnetic moment of the localized @xmath47electrons is screened completely by the spin of the conduction electrons .",
    "a detailed view of the @xmath48data recorded above 5.5  gpa is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : physique ] .",
    "the broadening of the antiferromagnetic transition is evident and may be related to an intrinsic behaviour of ceru@xmath9ge@xmath4  or more likely to a deviation from hydrostatic conditions , since the sample sees a pressure inhomogeneity of about @xmath49  gpa around 7  gpa .    the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : physique ] shows the low temperature part of the specific heat measured at 5.0  gpa where the anomaly at @xmath50 is maximum .",
    "the specific heat data confirm that this transition , also observed in transport measurements @xcite , has thermodynamic origin and is a bulk property .",
    "the nature of this transition is still unclear .",
    "several neutron experiments on substituted compounds ( substitution of ge and ce by si and la , respectively , simulates a pressure effect ; a correspondence with pressure is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) point to the existence of a low temperature transition even if the order parameter has not been identified yet .",
    "the indications are ( i ) the increase of the third order harmonic of the magnetic modulation in ceru@xmath4sige , leading to a squaring of the magnetic modulation @xcite ; ( ii ) a change in the magnetic excitation spectrum of ceru@xmath4sige from quasielastic above @xmath51  k to inelastic below @xmath50 @xcite ; ( iii ) in ce@xmath52la@xmath53ru@xmath4si@xmath4 the diffuse scattering measured slightly off the magnetic bragg peak shows a maximum at @xmath54  k instead at @xmath55  k @xcite .",
    "the specific heat of in the temperature range 1.511  k was measured up to 8  gpa with an ac ",
    "the evolution of the various magnetic phase transitions in this intermetallic compound could be followed up to the magnetic to non  magnetic phase boundary ( @xmath56  gpa ) .",
    "the ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) phase diagram is in excellent agreement with the previously presented one .",
    "this demonstrates that ac  calorimetry can be successfully adapted to high pressure experiments in a clamp pressure device , and opens a new route for thermodynamic measurements .",
