    "in this paper we study physical layer authentication over a noisy multiple access channel and no pre - shared key .",
    "such scenarios may occur when a network is established in a hostile environment .",
    "being able to trust the information observed is just as important as actually observing it .",
    "it also stands to reason , that always having a pre - shared key seems restrictive as it is dependent on a method to generate and secure the key .",
    "we model this scenario by considering two transmitters ( alice and neer - do - well eve ) and one receiver ( bob ) .",
    "alice and eve share a discrete memoryless multiple access channel ( dm - mac ) , so that not only may eve try to forge messages to bob , she may try to modify the ones alice transmits . to further complicate the matter , we assume that eve not only knows the codebook which alice and bob share , but the message alice will send as well .",
    "our goal is for bob to be able to validate the authenticity of the sender ( or alternatively the integrity of the information ) , as well as be able to decode the information given it is authentic .",
    "simmons first studied physical layer authentication in  @xcite .",
    "simmons allowed for alice and bob to have a pre - shared key , which eve did not have access to .",
    "this key , which can be made small relative to the number of symbols it protects , in essence partitions the entire state of messages into sets which are valid and ones that are not .",
    "any attempt by eve to modify the message then results , with high probability , in a message included in the invalid set .    physical layer authentication , without the use of pre - shared key ,",
    "was considered by maurer in  @xcite . instead of a pre - shared key , alice , bob , and eve",
    "are given given access to different random variables , which share some arbitrary correlation . by using their individual random variables ,",
    "alice and bob proceed in public discussion over a perfect channel to generate a secret key .",
    "this is related to authentication in that the channel being perfect allows eve the ability to perfectly spoof any packet from alice .",
    "hence , the distributions of the random variables play a pivotal role in establishing the authenticity of any message . in this model",
    "the three nodes must share copies of a random variable generated from an independent and identically distributed ( iid ) source . and",
    "furthermore the variables that alice and bob share must not be `` simulatable '' by eve given her random variable .",
    "use of an iid source though guarantees no underlying code structure , which could leak information about the random variables alice and bob view .",
    "it is also impractical in scenarios not concerned with secrecy to first generate a secret key for authentication purposes in later transmissions .    because of these limits",
    "others have studied authentication in noisy channels .",
    "works include yu et al .",
    "who in  @xcite used spread spectrum techniques in addition to a covert channel to ensure authentication  @xcite . and",
    "xiao et al in  @xcite , who used the unique scattering of individual users in indoor environments to authenticate packets .",
    "for purpose of discussion we focus on two works in particular .",
    "first , lai et al . , who in  @xcite considered the problem of authentication in a noisy channel model when alice and bob have a pre - shared key . in their model",
    "the link between bob and alice is noisy while the link between eve and bob is noise - free , a worst case scenario .",
    "much like the work of simmons , the key alice and bob share is used to label some transmitted sequences as valid and not . and much like simmons work , it is then nearly impossible for eve to pick a transmitted message that would be valid .",
    "the second work , is that of jiang  @xcite .",
    "jiang in specific considered the case where either alice or eve may transmit to bob , but not simultaneously . by assuming the channels distinct",
    ", jiang showed that even without a pre - shared secret key it was possible to guarantee authentication .",
    "this was done by considering the intersection of the distributions alice could induce at bob and the distributions eve could induce at bob had only marginal overlap if the channel from alice to bob was not simulatable using the channel from eve to bob .",
    "in contrast , by allowing simultaneous communication , we allow more possibilities for eve s attack .",
    "this is because eve does not need to attack the entire message transmitted , only a smaller portion , and thus only slightly disturb the distributions , which as mentioned previously were critical to ensuring authentication .",
    "much like jiang , we do this by showing that the distributions induced by the legitimate party , and the ones by the illegitimate party have marginal overlap .",
    "unlike jiang though , we approach the problem using traditional random coding methods and techniques .",
    "we derive a new inner bound , which is dependent on the channel not having a simulatable - like property .",
    "unlike simulability though , this property can be controlled in part by alice and her choice of distribution .",
    "random variables will be denoted by upper case letters , their alphabets will be the script version of that letter , and particular realizations of that random variable will be denoted in lower case . in other words , @xmath0 is a random variable , and @xmath1 is a particular realization of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath2-th extension of a random variable is denoted @xmath3 , and particular realizations of that random variable are denoted similarly by @xmath4 .",
    "to represent a particular value in the @xmath2-th extension we use subscripts , such as @xmath5 is the value in the @xmath6-th position of @xmath4 .",

    "* convention  2.11 ) .",

    "eve simultaneously chooses a sequence @xmath29 as a function of the message and encoder , which she transmits concurrently with alice s transmission .",
    "we assume that there exists an element @xmath30 representative of the state when eve decides not to transmit ( hence eve not attacking is denoted @xmath31 . )",
    "because the distribution associated with the output of the mac when eve is silent is of distinct importance , we refer to it specifically by @xmath32 . in general",
    ", bob will receive a value @xmath33 , and then will use a decoder @xmath34 to either output an estimate of the message , or instead to declare that eve is attempting to intrude .",
    "we assume that alice , bob and eve have access to the encoder @xmath35 and the decoder @xmath36 .",
    "we expect the code to decode to the correct message when eve is not attacking ( @xmath31 ) , and to either decode to the correct message or detect manipulation when eve is attacking ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "these expectations lead directly lead to the following definition for our physical layer authentication code .",
    "a @xmath38-physical layer authentication code is any encoder - decoder pair @xmath39 , for which the encoder takes @xmath40 messages and the decoder satisfies @xmath41    a code which meets these two requirements , can both decode and authenticate with high probability . we do not concern ourselves with the optimization of these two probabilities , and instead focus first on guaranteeing existence . as we will show using random coding ,",
    "there exist codes such that both probabilities go to zero as @xmath2 grows to infinity .",

    "it is not hard to see that in fact we can let @xmath74 and approach capacity .",
    "finally , in this work we assume that eve knows the message @xmath27 and encoding function @xmath35 .",
    "why not allow for eve to know @xmath4 as well ? while this does in fact make eve more powerful , it actually simplifies the math . indeed allowing eve knowledge of @xmath4 results in the property that for every @xmath38-physical layer authentication code there exist a corresponding deterministic @xmath75 physical layer authentication code such that @xmath76 .",
