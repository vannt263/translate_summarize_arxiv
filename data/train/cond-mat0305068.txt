    "one major application of this technique is the possibility to compare theoretical and experimental measurements on the lifetime modifications , as the coupling of the dot to the field depends strongly on the dot position .",

    "<S> we have fabricated and studied the photoluminescence from microdisks containing single , selected self - assembled quantum dots . using two electron beam lithography exposures and a two - step selective wet etching process </S>",
    "<S> , the dots were positioned at the microdisks edges with sub - micron precision . </S>",
    "<S> the selection and positioning of quantum dots enables an optimum coupling of the dot emission to the microdisks whispering modes .    </S>",
    "<S> microdisks offer a very efficient optical confinement at their periphery , yielding high quality factors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> q - values as high as 17000 have been reported for microdisks with inas quantum dots @xcite and values as high as @xmath0 have been reached with sio@xmath1 microdisks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this results in sharp emission lines and low lasing thresholds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum dots are especially well suited for microdisks as they introduce less absorption than quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> coupling a single quantum dot to the whispering modes of a microdisk would enable an optimum coupling of a single emitter to the maximum quality factor value that can be attained . </S>",
    "<S> single quantum dot based devices offer new functionalities such as single photon emission @xcite , a single dot is an exciting tool to study cavity quantum electrodynamics effects , as has been done with single atoms in cavities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the controlled coupling of a single emitter to a high quality factor cavity also enables a careful study of lifetime modifications . </S>",
    "<S> the inherent random positioning of self - assembled quantum dots makes it difficult to position dots in a cavity . </S>",
    "<S> all lifetime modification studies reported so far have been done with randomly positioned dots in cavities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a precise control of the dot position enables an optimal study of the emitter - cavity coupling @xcite , we achieve this goal by positioning the cavity respective to the dots . </S>",
    "<S> other techniques that have been used to position microstructures in relation to selected qds @xcite was considered unsuitable for producing high - quality microdisks .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample was grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy on a gaas wafer . </S>",
    "<S> a gaas buffer layer was first deposited followed by a 100 nm thick gainp layer serving as an etch stop during the pillar etching , and 600 nm of gaas was then deposited , in order to set the height of the pedestal . </S>",
    "<S> this value was chosen to avoid optical coupling with the substrate while still providing an efficient thermal contact between the microdisk and the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> finally , 90 nm of gainp were deposited with a low density of inp dots in the center of the layer .    </S>",
    "<S> a coordinate system was fabricated on the sample using electron beam lithography . </S>",
    "<S> gold marks were produced in regular arrays by thermal evaporation of gold followed by liftoff . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was then mapped with a micro - photoluminescence setup with sub - micron resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the photoluminescence from single dots and white light reflection from the metal markers was imaged simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> these images gave the position of quantum dots relative to the metal markers , an image is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a .    </S>",
    "<S> a second electron beam lithography exposure was made to define the microdisks . </S>",
    "<S> the gold marks were easily imaged through the resist with the electron microscope and were used as alignment markers to produce disks containing the selected dots in their periphery , where the whispering modes are most intense . </S>",
    "<S> circular sio masks with 5 micron diameter were obtained following liftoff . </S>",
    "<S> the structures were produced by wet etching to obtain high q values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a non selective etchant was used to etch through the gainp and into the gaas before the sio mask was removed . </S>",
    "<S> the pedestal was then formed by selective etching . </S>",
    "<S> details of the processing have been published elsewhere @xcite . a complete microdisk structure containing a single quantum dot </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c . </S>",
    "<S> fig . 1 a and b were taken on the same location , during mapping and after completing the processing . </S>",
    "<S> the dots are numbered and comparing the two images clearly shows that all the dots have been successfully placed at the microdisks edges .    </S>",
    "<S> photoluminescence experiments were done in a liquid helium cooled cryostat at a temperature of 10 k. the luminescence was collected using a microscope objective with 0.4 numerical aperture . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation source was a frequency doubled nd : yag laser emitting at 532 nm . </S>",
    "<S> spectra were acquired with a cooled ccd and a monochromator . </S>",
    "<S> images were taken with a video camera and a bandpass filter ( 10 nm fwhm ) centered at 720 nm .    </S>",
    "<S> inp quantum dots are especially well suited for this kind of experiment as they have been shown to emit single photons at the ideal wavelength for silicon detectors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lasing of the gainp in the disks we study here has been reported @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d shows spectra obtained on a microdisk containing a single quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> only a few sharp peaks are visible at low pumping power , which is typical for a single inp qd of this size @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to achieve strong coupling with a single quantum dot has been discussed by grard et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> microdisks are the best candidates , as micropillars have too large linewidths and microspheres have too large mode volumes . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that by placing a single quantum dot in the maximum field of a microdisk resonator of the right diameter , strong coupling could be achieved for a single quantum dot .    in an other microdisk sample , with random distribution of qds inside the cavities , the structure in fig . 2 was observed . </S>",
    "<S> such structures would be possible to create in a controlled way by using the demonstrated processing scheme . </S>",
    "<S> this might prove particularly useful for evaluating quantum information processing schemes based on this type of structure @xcite . </S>"
