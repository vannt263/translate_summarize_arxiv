    "maxwell s equations may be written in differential form as follows : @xmath0 the fields @xmath1 ( magnetic flux density ) and @xmath2 ( electric field strength ) determine the force on a particle of charge @xmath3 travelling with velocity @xmath4 ( the lorentz force equation ) : @xmath5 the electric displacement @xmath6 and magnetic intensity @xmath7 are related to the electric field and magnetic flux density by : @xmath8 the electric permittivity @xmath9 and magnetic permeability @xmath10 depend on the medium within which the fields exist .",
    "the values of these quantities in vacuum are fundamental physical constants . in si units : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the permittivity and permeability of a material characterize the response of that material to electric and magnetic fields . in simplified models ,",
    "they are often regarded as constants for a given material ; however , in reality the permittivity and permeability can have a complicated dependence on the fields that are present .",
    "note that the _ relative permittivity _ @xmath13 and the _ relative permeability _ @xmath14 are frequently used . these are dimensionless quantities , defined by : @xmath15 that is , the relative permittivity is the permittivity of a material relative to the permittivity of free space , and similarly for the relative permeability .",
    "the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the electric charge density ( charge per unit volume ) and electric current density ( @xmath18 is the charge crossing unit area perpendicular to unit vector @xmath19 per unit time ) . equations ( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwell3 ] ) are independent of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and are generally referred to as the `` homogeneous '' equations ; the other two equations , ( [ eq : maxwell1 ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwell4 ] ) are dependent on @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and are generally referred to as the `` inhomogeneous '' equations .",
    "the charge density and current density may be regarded as _",
    "sources _ of electromagnetic fields . when the charge density and current density are specified ( as functions of space , and , generally , time )",
    ", one can integrate maxwell s equations ( [ eq : maxwell1])([eq : maxwell4 ] ) to find possible electric and magnetic fields in the system .",
    "usually , however , the solution one finds by integration is not unique : for example , the field within an accelerator dipole magnet may be modified by propagating an electromagnetic wave through the magnet .",
    "however , by imposing certain constraints ( for example , that the fields within a magnet are independent of time ) it is possible to obtain a unique solution for the fields in a given system of electric charges and currents .",
    "most realistic situations are sufficiently complicated that solutions to maxwell s equations can not be obtained analytically .",
    "a variety of computer codes exist to provide solutions numerically , once the charges , currents , and properties of the materials present are all specified , see for example references @xcite",
    ". solving for the fields in realistic ( three - dimensional ) systems often requires a reasonable amount of computing power ; some sophisticated techniques have been developed for solving maxwell s equations numerically with good efficiency @xcite .",
    "we do not consider such techniques here , but focus instead on the analytical solutions that may be obtained in idealized situations .",
    "although the solutions in such cases may not be sufficiently accurate to complete the design of a real accelerator magnet , the analytical solutions do provide a useful basis for describing the fields in real magnets , and provide also some important connections with the beam dynamics in an accelerator .",
    "an important feature of maxwell s equations is that , for systems containing materials with constant permittivity and permeability ( i.e. permittivity and permeability that are independent of the fields present ) , the equations are _ linear _ in the fields and sources .",
    "that is , each term in the equations involves a field or a source to ( at most ) the first power , and products of fields or sources do not appear . as a consequence ,",
    "the _ principle of superposition _ applies : if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are solutions of maxwell s equations with the current densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then the field @xmath24 will be a solution of maxwell s equations , with the source given by the total current density @xmath25 .",
    "this means that it is possible to represent complicated fields as superpositions of simpler fields .",
    "an important and widely used analysis technique for accelerator magnets is to decompose the field ( determined from either a magnetic model , or from measurements of the field in an actual magnet ) into a set of multipoles .",
    "while it is often the ideal to produce a field consisting of a single multipole component , this is never perfectly achieved in practice : the multipole decomposition indicates the extent to which components other than the `` desired '' multipole are present .",
    "multipole decompositions also produce useful information for modelling the beam dynamics .",
    "although the principle of superposition strictly only applies in systems where the permittivity and permeability are independent of the fields , it is always possible to perform a multipole decomposition of the fields in free space ( e.g. in the interior of a vacuum chamber ) , since in that region the permittivity and permeability are constants . however , it should be remembered that for nonlinear materials ( where the permeability , for example , depends on the magnetic field strength ) , the field inside the material comprising the magnet will not necessarily be that expected if one were simply to add together the fields corresponding to the multipole components .",
    "solutions to maxwell s equations lead to a rich diversity of phenomena , including the fields around charges and currents in certain simple configurations , and the generation , transmission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "many existing texts cover these phenomena in detail ; see , for example , the authoritative text by jackson @xcite . therefore",
    ", we consider only briefly the electric field around a point charge and the magnetic field around a long straight wire carrying a uniform current : our main purpose here is to remind the reader of two important integral theorems ( gauss theorem , and stokes theorem ) , of which we shall make use later . in the following sections , we will discuss analytical solutions to maxwell s equations for situations relevant to some of the types of magnets commonly used in accelerators .",
    "these include multipoles ( dipoles , quadrupoles , sextupoles , and so on ) , solenoids , and insertion devices ( undulators and wigglers ) .",
    "we consider only static fields .",
    "we begin with two - dimensional fields , that is fields that are independent of one coordinate ( generally , the coordinate representing the direction of motion of the beam ) .",
    "we will show that multipole fields are indeed solutions of maxwell s equations , and we will derive the current distributions needed to generate `` pure '' multipole fields .",
    "we then discuss multipole decompositions , and compare techniques for determining the multipole components present in a given field from numerical field data ( from a model , or from measurements ) .",
    "finally , we consider how the two - dimensional multipole decomposition may be extended to three - dimensional fields , to include ( for example ) insertion devices , and fringe fields in multipole magnets .",

    "gauss theorem is helpful for obtaining physical interpretations of two of maxwell s equations , ( [ eq : maxwell1 ] ) and ( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) .",

    "in this case , it is interesting to take @xmath29 to be a sphere of radius @xmath33 . by symmetry",
    ", the magnitude of the electric field must be the same at all points on @xmath29 , and must be normal to the surface at each point .",

    "stokes theorem states that for any smooth vector field @xmath26 : @xmath38 where the loop @xmath39 bounds the surface @xmath40 . applied to maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell4 ] )",

    ", we can derive an expression for the strength of the magnetic field around a long , straight wire carrying current @xmath42 .",
    "the magnetic field must have rotational symmetry around the wire .",
    "there are two possibilities : a radial field , or a field consisting of closed concentric loops centred on the wire ( or some superposition of these fields ) .",
    "a radial field would violate maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the field must consist of closed concentric loops ; and by considering a circular loop of radius @xmath33 , we can perform the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampere1 ] ) : @xmath43 where @xmath42 is the total current carried by the wire . in this case",
    ", the line integral is performed around a loop @xmath39 centered on the wire , and in a plane perpendicular to the wire : essentially , this corresponds to one of the magnetic field lines , see fig .",

    "applying stokes theorem to the homogeneous maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell3 ] ) , we find : @xmath46 defining the electromotive force @xmath47 as the integral of the electric field around a closed loop , and the magnetic flux @xmath48 as the integral of the magnetic flux density over the surface bounded by the loop , eq .",
    "( [ eq : faraday1 ] ) gives : @xmath49 which is faraday s law of electromagnetic induction .",
    "faraday s law is significant for magnets with time - dependent fields , such as pulsed magnets ( used for injection and extraction ) , and magnets that are `` ramped '' ( for example , when changing the beam energy in a storage ring ) . the change in magnetic field will induce a voltage across the coil of the magnet , that must be taken into account when designing the power supply .",
    "also , the induced voltages can induce eddy currents in the core of the magnet , or in the coils themselves , leading to heating .",
    "this is an issue for superconducting magnets , which must be ramped slowly to avoid quenching @xcite .",
    "gauss theorem and stokes theorem can be applied to maxwell s equations to derive constraints on the behaviour of electromagnetic fields at boundaries between different materials . here",
    ", we shall focus on the boundary conditions on the magnetic field : these conditions will be useful when we consider multipole fields in iron - dominated magnets .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    consider first a short cylinder or `` pill box '' that crosses the boundary between two media , with the flat ends of the cylinder parallel to the boundary , see fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionb](a ) . applying gauss theorem to maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) gives : @xmath50 where the boundary @xmath29 encloses the volume @xmath28 within the cylinder .",
    "if we take the limit where the length of the cylinder ( @xmath51 ) approaches zero , then the only contributions to the surface integral come from the flat ends ; if these have infinitesimal area @xmath52 , then since the orientations of these surfaces are in opposite directions on opposite sides of the boundary , and parallel to the normal component of the magnetic field , we find : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the normal components of the magnetic flux density on either side of the boundary .",
    "hence : @xmath56 in other words , the normal component of the magnetic flux density is continuous across a boundary .",
    "a second boundary condition , this time on the component of the magnetic field parallel to a boundary , can be obtained by applying stokes theorem to maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell4 ] ) . in particular , we consider a surface @xmath40 bounded by a loop @xmath39 that crosses the boundary of the material , see fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaryconditionb](b ) . if we integrate both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwell4 ] ) over that surface , and apply stokes theorem ( [ eq : stokestheorem ] ) , we find : @xmath57 where @xmath42 is the total current flowing through the surface @xmath40 . now",
    ", let the surface @xmath40 take the form of a thin strip , with the short ends perpendicular to the boundary , and the long ends parallel to the boundary .",
    "in the limit that the length of the short ends goes to zero , the area of @xmath40 goes to zero : both the current flowing through the surface @xmath40 , and the electric displacement integrated over @xmath40 become zero . however , there are still contributions to the integral of @xmath7 around @xmath39 from the long sides of the strip .",
    "thus , we find that : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the component of the magnetic intensity parallel to the boundary at a point on one side of the boundary , and @xmath60 is the component of the magnetic intensity parallel to the boundary at a nearby point on the other side of the boundary . in other words ,",
    "the _ tangential _ component of the magnetic intensity @xmath7 is continuous across a boundary .",
    "we can derive a stronger contraint on the magnetic field at a boundary in the case that the material on one side of the boundary has infinite permeability ( which can provide a reasonable model for some ferromagnetic materials ) .",
    "since @xmath61 , it follows from ( [ eq : boundaryparallelh ] ) that : @xmath62 and in the limit @xmath63 , while @xmath64 remains finite , we must have : @xmath65 in other words , the magnetic flux density at the surface of a material of infinite permeability must be perpendicular to that surface .",
    "of course , the permeability of a material characterizes its response to an applied external magnetic field : in the case that the permeability is infinite , a material placed in an external magnetic field acquires a magnetization that exactly cancels any component of the external field at the surface of the material .",
    "consider a region of space free of charges and currents ; for example , the interior of an accelerator vacuum chamber ( at least , in an ideal case , and when the beam is not present ) . if we further exclude propagating electromagnetic waves , then any magnetic field generated by steady currents outside the vacuum chamber must satisfy : @xmath66 eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnetostatic1 ] ) is just maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnetostatic2 ] ) follows from maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell4 ] ) given that @xmath67 , @xmath44 , and derivatives with respect to time vanish .",
    "we shall show that a magnetic field @xmath68 with @xmath69 constant , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 given by : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a ( complex ) constant , satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ eq : magnetostatic1 ] ) and ( [ eq : magnetostatic2 ] ) .",
    "note that the field components @xmath70 and @xmath71 are real , and are obtained from the imaginary and real parts of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : multipolefield ] ) . to show that the above field satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ eq : magnetostatic1 ] ) and ( [ eq : magnetostatic2 ] ) , we apply the differential operator @xmath75 to each side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : multipolefield ] ) . applied to the left hand side",
    ", we find : @xmath76 applied to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : multipolefield ] ) , the differential operator ( [ eq : diffop ] ) gives : @xmath77 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : multipolefield ] ) , ( [ eq : diffmultipolelhs ] ) and ( [ eq : diffmultipolerhs ] ) , we find : @xmath78 finally , we note that @xmath69 is constant , so any derivatives of @xmath69 vanish ; furthermore , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are independent of @xmath79 , so any derivatives of these coordinates with respect to @xmath79 vanish .",
    "thus , we conclude that for the field ( [ eq : multipolefield ] ) : @xmath80 and that this field is therefore a solution to maxwell s equations within the vacuum chamber .",
    "of course , this analysis tells us only that the field is a _",
    "possible _ physical field : it does not tell us how to generate such a field . the problem of generating a field of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : multipolefield ] ) we shall consider in section  [ sec : generatingmultipoles ] .",
    "fields of the form ( [ eq : multipolefield ] ) are known as _ multipole fields_. the index @xmath81 ( an integer ) indicates the _ order _ of the multipole : @xmath82 is a dipole field , @xmath83 is a quadrupole field , @xmath84 is a sextupole field , and so on .",
    "a solenoid field has @xmath85 for all @xmath81 , and @xmath69 non - zero ; usually , a solenoid field is not considered a multipole field , and we assume ( unless stated otherwise ) that @xmath86 in a multipole magnet . note that we can apply the principle of superposition to deduce that a more general magnetic field can be constructed by adding together a set of multipole fields : @xmath87 a `` pure '' multipole field of order @xmath81 has @xmath88 for only that one value of @xmath81 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath74 in eq .",
    "[ eq : multipolesum ] characterise the strength and orientation of each multipole component in a two - dimensional magnetic field .",
    "it is sometimes more convenient to express the field using polar coordinates , rather than cartesian coordinates .",
    "writing @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : multipolesum ] ) becomes : @xmath91 by writing the multipole expansion in this form , we see immediately that the strength of the field in a pure multipole of order @xmath81 varies as @xmath92 with distance from the magnetic axis .",
    "we can go a stage further , and express the field in terms of polar components : @xmath93 thus : @xmath94 by writing the field in this form , we see that for a pure multipole of order @xmath81 , rotation of the magnet through @xmath95 around the @xmath79 axis simply changes the sign of the field .",
    "we also see that if we write : @xmath96 then the value of @xmath97 ( the phase of @xmath74 ) determines the orientation of the field .",
    "conventionally , a pure multipole with @xmath98 is known as a `` normal '' multipole , while a pure multipole with @xmath99 is known as a `` skew '' multipole .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is worth making a few final remarks about mode decompositions for three - dimensional fields .",
    "first , as already mentioned , in many cases a full three - dimensional mode decomposition will not be necessary . while this does provide a detailed description of the field in a form suitable for beam dynamics studies , three - dimensional decompositions",
    "do rely on a large number of accurate and detailed field measurements .",
    "while such `` measurements '' may be conveniently obtained from a model , it may be difficult or impractical to make such measurements on a real magnet .",
    "fortunately , in many cases , a two - dimensional field description in terms of multipoles is sufficient .",
    "generally , a three - dimensional analysis only need be undertaken where there are grounds to believe that the three - dimensional nature of the field is likely to have a significant impact on the beam dynamics .",
    "second , we have already emphasised that to obtain an accurate description of the field within some region in terms of a mode decomposition , the mode amplitudes should be determined by a fit on a surface enclosing the region of interest . outside the region bounded by the surface of the fit , the fitted field can be expected to diverge exponentially from the real field . however , in choosing the surface for the fit , the geometry of the magnet will impose some constraints .",
    "a magnet with a wide rectangular aperture may lend itself to a description using a cartesian basis ( fitting on the surface of a rectangular box ) ; a circular aperture , however , is more likely to require use of a polar basis ( fitting on the surface of a cylinder with circular cross - section ) .",
    "both cases have been described above .",
    "it may be appropriate in other cases to perform a fit on the surface of a cylinder with elliptical cross - section .",
    "the basis functions in this case involve mathieu functions .",
    "for further details , the reader is referred to work by dragt  @xcite and by dragt and mitchell  @xcite .",
    "our analysis of iron - dominated multipole magnets in section  [ sec : irondominatedmultipoles ] was based on the magnetic scalar potential , @xmath100 .",
    "the magnetic flux density can be derived from a scalar potential : @xmath101 in the case that the flux density has vanishing divergence and curl : @xmath102 more generally ( in particular , where the flux density has non - vanishing curl ) one derives the magnetic flux density from a vector potential @xmath103 , using : @xmath104 although we have not required the vector potential in our discussion of maxwell s equations for accelerator magnets , it is sometimes used in analysis of beam dynamics . in particular , descriptions of the dynamics based on hamiltonian mechanics generally use the vector potential rather than the magnetic flux density or the magnetic scalar potential .",
    "we therefore include here a brief discussion of the vector potential , paying attention to aspects relevant to the descriptions we have developed for two - dimensional and three - dimensional magnet fields .",
    "first , we note that the divergence of any curl is identically zero : @xmath105 for any differentiable vector field @xmath106 .",
    "thus , if we write @xmath107 , then maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) : @xmath108 is automatically satisfied .",
    "maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell4 ] ) in uniform media ( constant permeability ) , with zero current and static electric fields gives : @xmath109 where @xmath17 is the current density .",
    "this leads to the equation for the vector potential : @xmath110 eq .",
    "( [ eq : curlcurlaequalsmuj ] ) is a second - order differential equation for the vector potential in a medium with permeability @xmath10 , where the current density is @xmath17 .",
    "this appears harder to solve than the first - order differential equation for the magnetic flux density , eq .",
    "( [ eq : curlbequalsmuj ] ) .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq : curlcurlaequalsmuj ] ) may be simplified significantly , if we apply an appropriate _",
    "gauge condition_. to understand what this means , recall that the magnetic flux density is given by the curl of the vector potential , and that the curl of the gradient of any scalar field is identically zero .",
    "thus , we can add the gradient of a scalar field to a vector potential , and obtain a new vector potential that gives the same flux density as the old one . that is , if : @xmath111 and : @xmath112 for an arbitrary differentiable scalar field @xmath113 , then : @xmath114 in other words , the vector potential @xmath115 leads to exactly the same flux density as the vector potential @xmath103 .",
    "since the dynamics of a given system are determined by the fields rather than the potentials , either @xmath115 or @xmath103 is a valid choice for the description of the system .",
    "( [ eq : gaugetransformation ] ) is known as a _ gauge transformation_. the consequence of having the freedom to make a gauge transformation means that the vector potential for any given system is not uniquely defined : given some particular vector potential , it is always possible to make a gauge tranformation without any change in the physical observables of a system . the analogue in the case of electric fields , of course ,",
    "is that the `` zero '' of the electric scalar potential can be chosen arbitrarily : only _ changes _ in potential ( i.e. energy ) are observable , so given some particular scalar potential field , it is possible to add a constant ( that is , a quantity independent of position ) and obtain a new scalar potential that gives the same physical observables as the original scalar potential .    for magnetostatic fields , we can use a gauge transformation to simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : curlcurlaequalsmuj ] ) .",
    "suppose we have obtained a vector potential @xmath103 for some particular physical system .",
    "define a scalar field @xmath113 , which satisfies : @xmath116 then define : @xmath117 since @xmath115 and @xmath103 are related by a gauge transformation , they lead to the same magnetic flux density , and the same physical observables for the system . however , the divergence of @xmath115 vanishes : @xmath118 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq : psidef ] ) .",
    "thus , given any vector potential , we can make a gauge transformation to find a new vector potential that gives the same magnetic flux density , but has vanishing divergence . the _ gauge condition _ : @xmath119 is known as the _ coulomb gauge_. it is possible to work with other gauge conditions ( for example , for time - dependent electromagnetic fields the lorenz gauge condition is often more appropriate ) ; however , for our present purposes , the coulomb gauge leads to a simplification of eq .",
    "( [ eq : curlcurlaequalsmuj ] ) , which now becomes : @xmath120 eq .",
    "( [ eq : delsquaredaequalsminusmuj ] ) is poisson s equation for a vector field .",
    "note that despite being a second - order differential equation , it is in a sense simpler than maxwell s equation ( [ eq : maxwell4 ] ) , since we have `` decoupled '' the components of the vectors ; that is , we have a set of three uncoupled second - order differential equations , where each equation relates a component of the vector potential to the corresponding component of the current density .",
    "( [ eq : delsquaredaequalsminusmuj ] ) has the solution : @xmath121 in this form , we see that the potential at a point in space is inversely proportional to the distance from the source .",
    "now , consider the potential given by : @xmath122 taking derivatives , we find that : @xmath123 then , since @xmath124 and @xmath125 are zero , we have : @xmath126 hence : @xmath127 which is just the multipole field .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : multipolevectorpotential ] ) is a potential that gives a multipole field .",
    "note also that , since @xmath128 is independent of @xmath79 , this potential satisfies the coulomb gauge condition ( [ eq : coulombgaugecondition ] ) : @xmath129    an advantage of working with the vector potential in the coulomb gauge is that , for multipole fields , the transverse components of the vector potential are both zero .",
    "this simplifies , to some extent , the hamiltonian equations of motion for a particle moving through a multipole field .",
    "however , note that the longitudinal component @xmath69 of the magnetic flux density is zero in this case .",
    "to generate a solenoidal field , with @xmath69 equal to a non - zero constant , we need to introduce non - zero components for @xmath124 , or @xmath125 , or both . for example , a solenoid field with flux density @xmath130 may be derived from the vector potential : @xmath131    let us return for a moment to the case of multipole fields .",
    "if we work in a gauge in which the transverse components of the vector potential are both zero , then the field components are given by : @xmath132 from these expressions , we see that if we take any two points with the same @xmath133 coordinate , then the difference in the vector potential between these two points is given by the `` flux '' passing through a line between these points : @xmath134 similarly for any two points with the same @xmath135 coordinate : @xmath136 in general , for a field that is independent of @xmath79 , and working in a gauge where @xmath137 , we can write : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the change in the vector potential between two points @xmath140 and @xmath141 in a given plane @xmath142 ; and @xmath143 is the magnetic flux through a rectangular `` loop '' with vertices @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 : see fig .",
