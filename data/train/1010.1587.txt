    "the idea of studying a gravitational system by replicating certain of its aspects in a laboratory environment through other , analogous , means has gained wide popularity today .",
    "one of the main motivations behind the current interest in these analog systems is to study the hawking effect , which shows that a black hole evaporates through a process of spontaneous particle creation and emission @xcite .",
    "it was later shown that this type of particle creation is not unique to black hole space - times @xcite but is a generic feature of any space - time possessing an apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "the process by which hawking radiation is created is still not entirely understood , and seems virtually impossible to observe in gravitational systems .",
    "the search for a non - gravitational physical system that possesses some kind of analog to the hawking effect originated with so - called `` dumb holes '' , comprising acoustic waves in moving fluids @xcite , although a greater degree of success has been more recently achieved with surface waves , rather than acoustic waves , in moving fluids @xcite .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review of other promising non - gravitational systems , including bose - einstein condensates and superfluids .",
    "it is also possible to consider electromagnetic analog systems such as `` slow light '' propagating in highly dispersive media @xcite , nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite , and light propagating in moving dielectric fluids @xcite . while a physical realization for electromagnetic analog space - times would pose challenges for reproducing the hawking effect @xcite",
    ", it is  in principle  possible , and would certainly be useful for studying classical effects .",
    "a somewhat simpler electromagnetic approach is to identify the behavior of electromagnetic fields on a curved space - time manifold with the behavior of electromagnetic fields in a dielectric material residing in minkowski space - time .",
    "this idea seems to have been first advanced by eddington to argue that the deflection of light passing through the curved space - time near a massive object would be indistinguishable from the deflection of light passing by the same object if the space - time were minkowskian but filled with an appropriate dielectric material @xcite .",
    "gordon then examined the inverse problem of finding an equivalent curved space - time to describe a given dielectric material by an effective `` optical '' metric @xcite . in a similar vein",
    "it was noticed by plebanski that the form of the constitutive equations for electromagnetic fields in empty , curved , space - time is formally equivalent to the constitutive equations for electromagnetic fields in an appropriate dielectric @xcite .",
    "this formal equivalence has been exploited to study gravitational systems in only a few examples @xcite .",
    "two issues have contributed to the underdevelopment of this approach .",
    "one is that the materials required to mimic a gravitational system generally have somewhat unnatural characteristics , such as equal permeability and permittivity .",
    "another is that , as cautioned by plebanski himself @xcite , the plebanski equations are not strictly covariant , which calls into question the limits of their applicability .",
    "however , the recent development of man made `` metamaterials '' @xcite allows for wide ranging control of material parameters , to the extent of even achieving a negative refractive index @xcite . here we address the second issue by describing a completely covariant approach to dielectric analog space - times that generalizes the plebanski approach .",
    "clearly there are close connections between metamaterials and analog space - times , and the method described here is closely related to a particular approach @xcite in `` transformation optics '' , the emerging field of transformation - based metamaterial engineering @xcite . while these are still the early days of metamaterial exploration , the approach has already shown the potential to address fundamental questions @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : classicalem ] gives a brief review of electrodynamics in linear dielectric materials from a completely covariant , manifestly 4-dimensional standpoint .",
    "section [ sec : analogs ] addresses the mapping of electromagnetic fields from a curved , vacuum , manifold to a material residing in minkowski space - time .",
    "the characteristic parameters describing the analog material are determined as a function of position .",
    "section [ sec : schwarzschild ] reconsiders some examples known from the literature , not only demonstrating agreement with results obtained from the plebanski equations but also illustrating some additional mappings allowed by this new approach . in sec .  [",

    "thus we want to identify the null geodesics of the curved , vacuum , space - time with trajectories through the equivalent dielectric medium as determined by the wave equation in that medium . because the curved space - time is vacuum , @xmath33 .",
    "the question that we would like to answer is : given a curved space - time , how do we determine the dielectric material that mimics this curved space - time ?",

    "if the initial space - time is vacuum , then @xmath54 and @xmath55    equation ( [ eq : materialchi ] ) gives the permeability , permittivity , and magneto - electric couplings of a material that mimics a curved , vacuum , manifold .",
    "the metric @xmath32 of the curved space - time is arbitrary ; in particular @xmath32 need not be static @xcite . if the map @xmath35 is chosen to be the trivial coordinate identification @xmath56 ( technically this map is not the identity , since the manifolds are different ) , then @xmath57 this choice of @xmath35 recovers results obtained with the plebanski equations , but in general @xmath35 need not be the trivial map @xmath58 , allowing for greater freedom in identifying materials . for example , we show below how the exterior schwarzschild geometry may be mapped into a spherical shell of finite thickness , albeit at the expense of introducing divergences in the material parameters . it should be pointed out that the space - time represented by some dielectric configuration is not unique .",
    "this is because the hodge dual @xmath15 is invariant under conformal transformation of the metric @xmath59 .",
    "therefore a dielectric analog space - time actually represents an equivalence class of conformally related space - times .",

    "what follows , primed coordinates denote the curved , vacuum manifold , while unprimed coordinates denote those of minkowski space - time with dielectric media .",

    "( [ eq : idmaterialchi ] ) returns a material described by scalar - valued permeability and permittivity @xmath64 in agreement with results obtained from the plebanski equations @xcite .",
    "notice that the material parameters diverge at the singular surface @xmath65 .",
    "the dielectric analog of spherically symmetric gravitational systems in isotropic coordinates was first studied by de felice @xcite , while reznik @xcite mentions the material parameters representing the exterior schwarzschild geometry .",

    "( [ eq : constitutivecomponents2 ] ) . once again the horizon",
    "is characterized by divergent material parameters . also note that in both of the previous examples the material fills the entire space .",
    "however , by adopting some map @xmath69 , we may gain some freedom in specifying the boundaries of the material .",
    "for example , adopting @xmath70 maps the exterior schwarzschild geometry onto a spherical shell @xmath71 . using this map in eq .",
    "( [ eq : materialchi ] ) now leads to @xmath72 in a sense this result is worse in terms of the material , as its permeability and permittivity now diverge at both the inner and outer surfaces of the shell .",
    "however , this behavior is not unexpected , and is similar to the example of compactifying a flat space - time containing an electric charge , which results in the appearance of an image charge on the boundary .",
    "we may go a step further and try to remove the divergences in @xmath73 for the compactified exterior schwarzschild analog by modulating the time coordinate with a map such as @xmath74 we expect that this kind of map should eliminate the infinite blue shift by redefining time as the wavelength decreases towards the singular surfaces . turning the crank on eq .",
    "( [ eq : materialchi ] ) returns @xmath75 which is finite , as desired",
    ". however , this type of spatially dependent time transformation generically introduces magneto - electric couplings @xcite , which in this case turn out to be @xmath76 thus the divergences have been shifted from the permeability and permittivity to divergences in new magneto - electric couplings . in the black hole space - time , ingoing light rays will be lost behind the horizon , so it is not surprising that trying to mimic this behavior in a material should require these essential singularities to appear somewhere . note that not only do the magneto - electric couplings diverge at the inner and outer surface of the material shell , but there is also a sign change when @xmath77 , and @xmath78 momentarily vanish at @xmath79 . on the schwarzschild manifold this corresponds to the point @xmath80 , which is precisely the radius of the photon sphere in the schwarzschild geometry",
    "before considering any further examples , return first to the constitutive equations and material tensor @xmath18 . as they stand , eqs .

    "thus , a more appropriate version of eq .  ( [ eq : constitutivecomponents1 ] ) would be something like    [ eq : constitutivecomponents3 ] @xmath87 @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the hodge dual on an appropriate 3-dimensional spatial hypersurface . but this requires that we resolve the space - time into space and time components , selecting an observer to define a direction of time . the spatial hypersurface is then orthogonal to the selected direction of time .",
    "transforming to the local frame of the selected observer we can make the identifications of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartesianchi ] ) and then give the constitutive equations a 3-dimensional representation .    in the schwarzschild example above we expressed the results in spherical coordinates in the representation of eq .",

    "in analyzing the analog exterior kerr geometry , it was found that the `` usual '' representation of the constitutive relations requires careful consideration as it may lead to spurious divergences . however , the quantity with real relevance for the behavior of light in the material is @xmath18 and the spurious divergences of the usual , 3-dimensional representation occur because they rely on the inverse of elements of @xmath18 that may vanish at a point .",
