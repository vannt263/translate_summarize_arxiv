    "the development of rechargeable batteries has been an important milestone in the quest for clean sources of energy . among batteries , li - ion batteries with licoo@xmath3 as the cathode material have significant high energy density and found remarkable success in application to portable electronic devices @xcite . however , since licoo@xmath3 suffers from high cost , toxicity , and safety issues , the material is not appropriate for use in electric vehicles . in recent decades ,",
    "substitutional materials for licoo@xmath3 have been investigated , and some manganites are preferred for li - ion batteries since they have low cost , no toxicity , and better safety characteristics .",
    "in fact , limn@xmath3o@xmath4 with a spinel structure has been successfully employed as the cathode in electric vehicles @xcite .",
    "limno@xmath3 and related materials including other transition metal elements with a layered structure are promising cathode materials @xcite .",
    "manganites such as camn@xmath4o@xmath5 and mno@xmath3 are also expected to act as catalysts in photosystems and artificial photosynthesis @xcite .",
    "for application to cathodes and catalysts , _ surface _ electron states play important roles because manganites work as cathodes and catalysts in chemical reactions involving a change of the valence of surface manganese ions mainly from mn@xmath2 to mn@xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , in the case of cathodes , if mn@xmath6 ions are present on the surface , manganese dissolution from the lattice into the electrolyte occurs owing to the disproportion of mn@xmath6 ions into mn@xmath7 and mn@xmath2 ions @xcite .",
    "this reaction is one of the most important factors causing the capacity fading of cathodes in li - ion batteries .",
    "thus , for the material to achieve high efficiency as a cathode or catalyst , it is desirable to retain the mn@xmath6 ions in the bulk while the mn@xmath2 ions reside on the surface .",
    "previous studies approached this problem using first - principles calculations of the charge structure on the surface of manganites . for @xmath8-mno@xmath3 , which is obtained by removing li ions from limn@xmath3o@xmath4 , a portion of mn@xmath2 ions transition to mn@xmath6 ions because of surface reconstruction @xcite .",
    "first - principles calculations have enabled us to consider surface reconstruction or so , but such calculations are limited to small clusters .",
    "therefore , studies of the microscopic mechanisms causing the valence imbalance of manganese ions between the surface and bulk are meaningful when trying to understand increasingly large clusters .    to further the above research , we have investigated the effect of the surface on the electronic state in layered manganites using a @xmath9 lattice on the basis of an orbital - degenerate double - exchange model with surfaces @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to clarify the difference in the electron numbers between the surface and bulk , we have concentrated on @xmath0 electron states for some fixed @xmath1 spin patterns . as typical examples , we have chosen two types of @xmath1 spin structures : the c - type antiferromagnetic ( af ) and sheet - like af phases .",
    "these phases were chosen because they have been found in the bulk for some values of @xmath10 , when we include the effect of jahn - teller distortions in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 lattices @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "we have confirmed that the number of mn@xmath2 ions on the surface is always larger than that in the bulk , which is understood by surface - induced friedel oscillations .",
    "note that the behavior of friedel oscillations is different between two @xmath1 spin structures .",
    "thus , it is necessary to carefully investigate the behavior of these oscillations for future applications to cathodes and catalysts .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the behavior of surface - induced friedel oscillations in layered manganites using an orbital - degenerate double - exchange model with surface effects for other types of @xmath1 spin structures .",
    "it is found that the number of mn@xmath2 ions on the surface is always larger than that in the bulk owing to surface - induced friedel oscillations .",
    "furthermore , irrespective of the type of @xmath1 spin structures , we find that the friedel oscillations are enhanced when the fermi - surface curves with better nesting properties exist .",
    "namely , the dimension of the area of ferromagnetic ( fm ) @xmath1 spin structure is not essential to the enhancement of friedel oscillations .",
    "we believe that these results will contribute to the development of highly - efficient cathodes and catalysts . for the calculations in this paper , we use @xmath13 .",
    "herein we introduce the orbital - degenerate double - exchange model @xcite .",
    "this model has been widely used to successfully investigate the physical properties in layered manganites , such as colossal magneto - resistance phenomena @xcite and various types of charge and/or orbital orders in the bulk @xcite . to simplify the model , we consider a widely - used approximation that invokes infinite hund coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 electron spins . in this limit",
    ", the @xmath0 electron spin perfectly aligns along the @xmath1 spin direction , reducing the spin degrees of freedom of @xmath0 electrons .",
    "namely , the @xmath0 electrons move only in the fm region of @xmath1 spins , while in the af region , @xmath0 electrons are localized .",
    "the model hamiltonian for this system is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the annihilation operator for a spinless @xmath0 electron in the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) orbitals at site @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the vector connecting nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is an ising - like @xmath1 spin at site @xmath19 with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 denotes the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude between @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals along the @xmath20 direction with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we set the energy , @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the hopping amplitudes between different orbitals of a spinless @xmath0-electron system change sign between along the x - and y- directions , @xmath31 . the second term in eq .",
    "@xmath32 , @xmath10 , is the af coupling between the nearest - neighbor @xmath1 spins and @xmath33 denotes the nearest - neighbor site pair . in this paper",
    ", we do not include explicitly the coulomb interaction terms , but the effect is partially considered by working with a large hund coupling .",
    "namely , we consider a manganite with large bandwidth .",
    "we define @xmath34 as the hole doping and @xmath35 as the electron number of @xmath0 electrons per site with a relation of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 indicates the average number of mn@xmath2 ions per site .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian in a @xmath9 lattice : one layer is composed of a @xmath37 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions along the x- and y - axes . to introduce surfaces to the model",
    ", we consider a stack of @xmath38 layers with open boundary condition ( obc ) along the z - axis . in this paper , we introduce the obc in the sense of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the wavefunction of a spinless @xmath0 electron along the z - axis and @xmath41 is a layer number .",
    "namely , the first layer along the z - axis is the surface , whereas the @xmath42-th layer denotes the bulk .",
    "spins , respectively .",
    "( a ) the spin structure of the zigzag sheet af state . ( b ) the spin structure in the fm state . ]    in this paper , we remark the @xmath0-electron properties on the background of the fixed @xmath1 spin structure . in our previous study , we investigated two @xmath1 spin structures : a c - type af ( c - af ) state and an a - type af ( a - af ) state @xcite . in the c - af state , @xmath0 electrons can move only along the z - axis owing to infinite hund coupling .",
    "thus , the system is regarded as a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain with the obc along the z - axis . in the a - af state",
    ", @xmath0 electrons can move in the x - z plane , leading to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) sheet with edges . on the other hand , in this paper , we assume two other possible @xmath1 spin structures , zigzag sheet af and fm states , as shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , respectively . at least in a @xmath43 lattice with surfaces , it is easy to show that these magnetic states actually appear as the ground states for appropriate values of @xmath10 , but detailed discussion on the stability of ground - state magnetic structures in the large cluster is postponed in future . in the zigzag sheet af state , the fm regions of @xmath1 spins form zigzag structures in the x- and y- directions , whereas @xmath1 spins are ferromagnetic in the z- direction .",
    "thus , the system is regarded as a 2d sheet with edges , where hopping amplitudes change periodically . in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) fm state",
    ", @xmath0 electrons can move in all three dimensions .    by using these lattices ,",
    "we evaluate @xmath44 , the number of mn@xmath2 ions per site in layer @xmath41 , and investigate the behavior of the surface - induced friedel oscillations . for several @xmath1 spin structures with different fm region dimensions",
    ", we examine the factor that determines the behavior of the oscillations .",
    "note that @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the number of mn@xmath2 ions per site on the surface and in the bulk , respectively .",
    "before proceeding to the results of our calculations , we need to briefly review our previous results @xcite .",
    "we observe that @xmath44 clearly exhibits a damped oscillation from the surface ( @xmath47 ) to the bulk ( @xmath48 ) , which is understood to be the surface - induced friedel oscillation , and results in an increase in the number of mn@xmath2 ions on the surface . in the 1d system such as the c - af state ,",
    "the formula for friedel oscillation is expressed as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fermi momentum and @xmath51 is the correlation exponent @xcite . since we do not include coulomb interactions among @xmath0 electrons , @xmath52 , which leads to @xmath53 .    on the other hand , in the 2d system such as the a - af state , the formula for friedel oscillations",
    "is modified to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the z - component of the fermi momentum with good nesting properties along the z - axis .",
    "@xmath56 is the damping power for the oscillations .",
    "we have confirmed that in the 2d system @xmath57 depends on hole doping , @xmath34 , and a relevant orbital , @xmath25 , which leads to @xmath58 . in other words ,",
    "the envelope of the 2d friedel oscillations decays faster than @xmath53 . at this stage ,",
    "the definite expression of @xmath56 is not obtained . however , in general , @xmath45 seems to be increasingly suppressed in higher dimensional systems since the influence of the surface on the system becomes relatively weaker as the dimension of the fm region increases .     vs. @xmath41 plot for @xmath59 in the zigzag sheet af state .",
    "the blue dotted curve denotes the envelope expressed by @xmath53 , and the broken horizontal line denotes the value of @xmath34 .",
    "( b ) two fermi - surface curves of the @xmath0-electron system for @xmath59 .",
    "the magnitudes of the fermi momentum along the z - axis are both @xmath60 , which is consistent with the period of the oscillation in ( a ) .",
    "( c ) two fermi - surface curves for @xmath61 .",
    "( d ) efficiency @xmath62 vs. @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 . ]      first , let us consider the charge structure in the zigzag sheet af state . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we show @xmath44 vs. @xmath41 for @xmath59 . since the zigzag sheet af indicates a 2d - like system even though the fm region is not a plane ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , one could naively consider @xmath44 to be expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2d ] ) .",
    "however , as observed in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the envelope of the oscillations is well expressed by @xmath53 .",
    "namely , the friedel oscillation pattern is rather 1d - like in spite of the 2d - like fm region .    to investigate one of the factors that determines the value of @xmath56 , let us examine the oscillations from a viewpoint of the fermi - surface structure .",
    "2(b ) , we show two fermi - surface curves at @xmath59 .",
    "note that we depict the fermi - surface curves considering obc along the z - axis .",
    "when we consider the @xmath38 layers stacked along the z - axis with obc , @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is an integer , leading to @xmath68 . in the zigzag sheet af state , we find that the spinless @xmath0-electron system possesses a quasi-1d fermi - surface structure along the z - axis for a certain hole doping , @xmath34 . even in the 2d system ,",
    "when the fermi - surface curves have a quasi-1d structure along the z - axis , the envelope of the oscillations is expressed by @xmath53 as if in the 1d system . the period of the oscillations in fig .",
    "2(a ) is given by @xmath69 , consistent with the @xmath55 shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) and used in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2d ] ) .",
    "2(c ) shows the fermi - surface curves at @xmath61 . for @xmath61",
    ", the fermi - surface curves also retain the quasi 1d structure along the z - axis and we can confirm the value of @xmath56 is almost unity .",
    "the nesting properties are lost for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , so the envelope of the oscillations decays faster than @xmath53 .",
    "to understand the increase in @xmath45 compared with @xmath34 , we evaluate the efficiency @xmath62 , given by @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "this quantity denotes to what degree the mn@xmath2 ions appear on the surface at a given hole doping @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath45 is enhanced , we expect that the efficiency as cathodes and catalysts is increased .",
    "thus , @xmath62 has been called the `` efficiency '' .",
    "note that @xmath62 is associated with the magnitude of amplitude of the friedel oscillations .",
    "2(d ) shows the plot of @xmath62 as a function of @xmath34 for the zigzag sheet af state .",
    "we find the magnitude of @xmath62 exhibits a peak between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , for which one fermi - surface curve has perfect nesting properties , leading to a van hove singularity .",
    "note that the small oscillations in @xmath62 around @xmath74 are effects due to the size of the lattice .",
    "if we increase the size of the lattice , these oscillations disappear .",
    "thus , we can conclude that when the spinless @xmath0-electron system possesses a fermi - surface structure with decent nesting properties along the z - axis , the value of @xmath56 becomes unity and the amplitude of the friedel oscillations tends to be larger .",
    "namely , the behavior of the friedel oscillations is @xmath75 determined by the dimension of @xmath1 spin structure itself , but the fermi - surface structure of @xmath0-electron system is essentially important .     vs. @xmath41 plot for @xmath76 in the 3d fm state .",
    "the broken horizontal line denotes the value of @xmath34 .",
    "( b ) efficiency @xmath62 vs. @xmath34 .",
    "( c ) @xmath77/[1-n(z)]$ ] vs. @xmath34 for @xmath47 and @xmath42 .",
    "( d ) orbital arrangement on the surface x - y plane for @xmath78 .",
    "the orbital size is chosen to be proportional to the orbital density . ]",
    "3(a ) shows the plot of @xmath44 vs. @xmath41 for @xmath76 ; surface - induced friedel oscillations can be observed in the figure .",
    "note that @xmath46 is slightly smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the zigzag sheet af state , the envelope of the oscillations decays faster than @xmath53 , since the nesting properties are weak in the 3d @xmath0-electron system . as observed in fig .",
    "3(b ) , @xmath62 decreases monotonically in the fm state , which can be explained by the fact that the nesting properties in the 3d @xmath0-electron system are enhanced to some extent for smaller @xmath34 .    a characteristic point for the fm phase",
    "is the appearance of an orbital arrangement on the surface , in sharp contrast to other @xmath1 spin structures . in fig .",
    "3(c ) , we plot @xmath77/[1-n(z)]$ ] vs. @xmath34 for @xmath47 and @xmath42 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the average electron number in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 orbitals , respectively . in the bulk ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 orbitals are occupied with equal weights because cubic symmetry is recovered in the 3d environment . on the surface ,",
    "@xmath17 orbitals are selectively occupied , since @xmath0 electrons on the surface layer can gain kinetic energy by the 2d motion in the x - y plane than the 1d motion along the z - direction .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "3(d ) , there is a large density of @xmath17 orbitals with a ferromagnetic - arrangement on the surface , while @xmath81 is relatively small .",
    "namely , electrons on the surface continue to occupy @xmath17 and escape only from @xmath18 orbitals , leading to the overall increase of @xmath45 .",
    "in this paper , we have evaluated @xmath44 , the number of mn@xmath2 ions per site in layer @xmath41 , by analyzing the orbital - degenerate double - exchange model with surfaces for zigzag sheet af and 3d fm states .",
    "we have found that the surface - induced friedel oscillations in @xmath44 are enhanced , when the spinless @xmath0-electron systems possess fermi - surface structures with improved nesting properties along the z - axis , leading to an increase of mn@xmath2 ions on the surface . for cathodes and catalysts , retaining mn@xmath2 ions on the surface and mn@xmath6 in the bulk",
    "is desirable .",
    "subsequently , we can conclude that the @xmath1 spin structures possessing fermi - surface structures with good nesting properties are possibly suitable for high - efficiency cathodes in li - ion batteries and catalysts .",
    "we believe that the present results provide a fundamental understanding for further application of manganites to such systems .",
    "we thank k. hattori , k. kubo , and k. ueda for discussions and comments .",
