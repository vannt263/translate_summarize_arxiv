    "the nro 45-m radio telescope is one of the world largest millimeter - wave single - dish telescopes operated by the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) and located near the yatsugatake mountains on the border of nagano prefecture and yamanashi prefecture in japan .",
    "the observatory s longitude , latitude , and altitude are 138@xmath4 28@xmath5 13@xmath6 ( e ) , 35@xmath4 56@xmath5 27@xmath6 ( n ) , and 1349-m , respectively .",
    "the telescope is equipped with various receivers for observations at frequencies ranging from 20 ghz to 116 ghz , and used for various research fields such as star and planet formation , astrochemistry , and evolution of galaxies . however , no receivers that can conduct polarization observations are available at present . to open a new science window of polarization observations at millimeter wavelengths using the nro 45-m telescope",
    ", we developed a 40 ghz ( @xmath7 mm ) band , dual - polarization receiver .",
    "the dual - polarization receiver also has an advantage even for standard molecular line observations ; by observing two orthogonal polarized components simultaneously , the sigal - to - noise ratio can be improved by a factor of @xmath8 with the same observation time .",
    "magnetic fields are thought to play an important role in star formation ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ) . however , the role of magnetic field in star formation process remains controversial ( crutcher et al .",
    "2010 ; crutcher 2012 ) .",
    "this is in part due to the difficulty of measuring the magnetic field strengths in molecular clouds .",
    "previous zeeman observations toward star - forming regions have been conducted mainly at low frequencies using h@xmath9i and oh lines ( e.g. , crutcher et al .",
    "1993 ; heiles & troland 2004 ) .",
    "these observations aim to measure the strengths of line - of - sight magnetic fields associated with interstellar clouds from the stokes @xmath1 spectra .",
    "strong lines like oh ( @xmath10 ghz ) and h@xmath11o masers ( @xmath12 ghz ) have also been used for the zeeman observations ( e.g. , fiebig & gsten 1989 ) .",
    "these maser lines are thought to arise from the compact dense spots created by shocks near protostars .",
    "however , very few observations on molecules that probe dense molecular gas have been carried out so far ( crutcher et al . 1999 ; falgarone et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this is because among the molecules that have rotational transition lines with critical densities of 10@xmath13 @xmath14 , there are only a few molecules that have large magnetic dipole moments to show observable zeeman splitting , e.g. , cn , ccs , and so .",
    "crutcher et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured the zeeman effect of the cn ( @xmath15 ) lines at 113 ghz .",
    "cn lines have critical densities of @xmath16 @xmath14 and thus is the suitable tracer to detect dense gas .",
    "the zeeman observations at higher frequencies like 100 ghz are challenging because the zeeman splitting is often smeared by the line broadening due to internal motions .",
    "therefore , the main targets of the cn zeeman observations are massive star - forming regions which sometimes emit intense emission lines of cn and are expected to have stronger magnetic fields .",
    "these observations provide us important information of the magnetic fields in star - forming regions .",
    "however , the role of magnetic fields in the gravitational collapse of prestellar cores remain uncertain .",
    "to measure the strengths of magnetic fields associated with dense molecular cloud cores prior to star formation , we need other molecules that can trace the dense molecular gas and have relatively large dipole moments .",
    "one of such molecules is thioxoethenylidene radical , ccs , which is a carbon - chain molecule and known to be abundant in molecular clouds before star formation happens ( suzuki et al .",
    "ccs has a critical density of @xmath17 @xmath14 and the zeeman splitting is expected to be as large as 0.64 hz/@xmath18 g ( shinnaga & yamamoto 2000 ) , because ccs has an unpaired electron .",
    "ccs are often used as a good tracer of pre - protostellar cores and ccs emission tends to be strongest at the 40 ghz band in molecular clouds ( suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the 45 ghz band receivers designed to conduct the zeeman observations are rare in the world .",
    "the zeeman observations at the 40 ghz band can be conducted with the very large array ( vla , momjian & sarma 2012 ) .",
    "since vla is an interferometer , the spatially - extended emission is significantly filtered out .",
    "ccs emission is sometimes spatially extended , and therefore we consider that single dish telescopes have an advantage to detect ccs zeeman splitting toward dense molecular cloud cores .",
    "the 45-ghz receiver is also useful to conduct other observations .",
    "for example , a number of carbon - chain molecules such as hc@xmath19n , hc@xmath20n and so on can often show strong emission at the 40 ghz band ( suzuki et al .",
    "1992 ; hirota & yamamoto 2006 ) .",
    "these molecules are abundant at early evolutionary stages of molecular clouds before star formation is initiated .",
    "therefore , their spatial distributions give us a hint to uncover the evolutionary stages of molecular clouds and cores .",
    "mapping observations using single dish telescopes are expected to be ideal to reveal the spatial distribution of prestellar gas in molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , we consider it important to develop the new receiver at the 40 ghz band for the nro 45-m telescope to do new astronomical sciences .    in the present paper",
    ", we describe the basic characteristics of the newly - developed 40-ghz receiver system z45 and show its performance . the detail and performance of the polarization observations",
    "is presented in a forthcoming paper of this project .",
    "then , we describe the detail of the receiver system in section [ sec : develop ] .",
    "observational results of the sio masers from an evolved star , r - leo , and continuum measurements of saturn are presented in section [ sec : results ] and the size and shape of the system s primary beam and the main beam efficiency of the antenna are derived .",
    "then , we present in section [ sec : test ] some examples of observations of some molecular lines at the 40-ghz band .",
    "these observations show the high performance of z45 .",
    "finally , we summarize the conclusion in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "a primary science goal for the new receiver is to conduct the zeeman measurements toward dense cores prior to star formation , i.e. , pre - protostellar cores or prestellar cores in short .",
    "[ [ role - of - magnetic - field - in - gravitational - collapse - of - prestellar - cores ] ] role of magnetic field in gravitational collapse of prestellar cores ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the dynamical stability of a magnetized prestellar core is determined by an important parameter , mass - to - magnetic - flux ratio , @xmath21 ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "if the mass - to - flux ratio is larger than the critical value @xmath22 ) , the magnetic field can not support the whole cloud against self - gravity .",
    "such a cloud is called magnetically - supercritical and collapses dynamically to form stars .",
    "if the mass - to - flux ratio is smaller than the critical value , the magnetic field can support the cloud against self - gravity .",
    "such a cloud is called magnetically - subcritical .",
    "a magnetically - subcritical cloud can contract quasi - statically in losing the magnetic flux due to ambipolar diffusion .",
    "when the central dense part of the subcritical core becomes magnetically - supercritical , it collapses dynamically to form stars ( e.g. , nakamura & li 2003 ) .",
    "thus , the evolution of the magnetized cores is controlled by magnetic field strength . in this project",
    ", we aim to measure the strengths of the magnetic field associated with prestellar cores through the zeeman measurements and constrain the role of magnetic field in the dynamical evolution of the cores .",
    "the zeeman effect can be observed as the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a magnetic field . since the displacement between the separated components can be given as a function of the magnetic field strength , the zeeman observations allow us to measure the magnetic field strength directly .",
    "however , the detection of the zeeman splitting toward prestellar cores is challenging because the interstellar magnetic field is subtle and the splitting frequency interval is narrow , often obscured by the doppler broadening due to internal motions of the cores . to detect the zeeman splitting",
    ", we need spectral lines that have large magnetic dipole moments .",
    "the low frequency lines have advantage to distinguish between the zeeman splitting and the doppler broadening .",
    "hence , the previous zeeman measurements have been carried out mainly with low - frequency h@xmath9i and oh lines ( @xmath23 ghz ) , or the strong maser lines .",
    "however , the h@xmath9i and oh lines can trace only low density gas of @xmath24 @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", the maser lines can trace only the high density , high temperature spots near the stars .",
    "in other words , our knowledge of the magnetic fields associated with dense molecular gas remains limited .",
    "recently , falgarone et al . (",
    "2008 ) have successfully detected cn zeeman splitting at a 100 ghz band .",
    "cn is one of the dense molecular gas tracers with a high critical density of @xmath25 @xmath14 .",
    "the target clouds are , however , strongly biased toward massive - star - forming regions or protostellar cores that have strong cn emission . to understand the role of magnetic fields in initiating the gravitational collapse of the cores , it is important to measure the magnetic field of the cores that do not contain any stars yet , i.e. , prestellar cores .",
    "one of the good tracers of high - density molecular gas in prestellar phase is thioxoethenylidene radical , ccs , which is abundant in the early phase of core evolution prior to the protostellar formation .",
    "ccs also has a high zeeman splitting factor of its ghz transitions ( @xmath26 hz @xmath18g@xmath27 for @xmath0 transition , shinnaga & yamamoto 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , the 45 ghz line is one of the strongest ccs lines in prestellar cores with temperatures of about 10 k. even if the emission of @xmath0 ( 45 ghz ) is relatively strong ( @xmath28 k ) , the emission in the 100 ghz band ( e.g. , @xmath29 ) is often very weak ( @xmath30 k ) ( see figure 1 of wolkovitch et al .",
    "although the 22.3 ghz ccs ( @xmath31 ) line sometimes has comparable strength to that of ccs ( @xmath32 ) , the beam dilution effect is often significant because of the lower frequency .",
    "therefore , the 45 ghz ccs line is likely to be most suitable for the zeeman measurements . until now ,",
    "shinnaga et al . ( 1999b ) reported the tentative detection of the magnetic field of 160 @xmath33 42 @xmath18 g toward l1521e using the @xmath0 line ( @xmath34 45 ghz ) , and levin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported 48 @xmath33 31 @xmath18 g toward l1498 , using the @xmath35 line ( @xmath34 33 ghz ) .    to shed light on the issue of the role of magnetic field in star formation ,",
    "we have developed a new 40 ghz - band receiver system ( hereafter z45 ) for the nro 45 m telescope and started a zeeman measurement project , in which we attempt to measure the magnetic field strength using the zeeman splitting of ccs ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that at a distance of nearby star forming regions like taurus ( @xmath34 140 pc ) , the spatial resolution of the nro 45-m telescope at 45 ghz is 6000 au ( @xmath36 0.03 pc ) , which is comparable to the typical sizes of prestellar cores .",
    "this work is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research of japan ( 24244017 ) and the national science foundation under grant ( nsf phy11 - 25915 ) .",
    "we are grateful to the staffs at the nobeyama radio observatory for operating the nro 45-m telescope .",
