    "the statistical properties of giant gravitationally lensed arcs in galaxy clusters are sensitive to clusters properties , such as mass function , mass profile , and concentration , which in turn depend on cosmology .",

    "artificial sources were all placed at redshift @xmath8 , which is close to the average redshift of observed arcs ( kneib & soucail 1996 ) .",
    "b98 argued that using a single source redshift is acceptable because the change in the critical surface mass density is @xmath9 , for clusters at redshift @xmath10 , when the source redshift varies in the range @xmath11 . from the simulated lensed images ,",
    "b98 obtained the theoretical optical depth for forming arcs with length - to - width ratios @xmath12 . by multiplying the lensing optical depth by the density of background sources with magnitudes @xmath13 mag , as measured by smail et al .",

    "the predicted numbers of arcs were compared with the numbers observed in a sample of 16 x - ray - selected clusters from the einstein observatory extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; le fevre et al .",
    "b98 found that the observed number of arcs was higher by an order of magnitude than the predictions of the ( now - standard ) @xmath7-dominated cold dark matter ( @xmath7cdm ) cosmological model .",
    "this initial study of arc statistics by b98 motivated several subsequent studies , both theoretical and observational . from the observational side , improvements in the volume and quality of data",

    "they performed several lensing simulations , each with artificial sources on a single redshift plane , as in b98 .",
    "however , instead of using single simulated clusters , they lensed their sources through the whole volume of an n - body simulation .",
    "furthermore , the magnification of the arcs was used as a proxy for the @xmath14 ratios , instead of a direct measurement .",
    "they found that the cross section is a steep function of source redshift , and concluded that the order of magnitude problem reported by b98 can be resolved by adding sources at redshifts other than @xmath8 to the simulations .",
    "however , li et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have found that approximating the @xmath14 ratio by the magnification is incorrect , and that the cross section dependence on source redshift is shallower than the one found by wambsganss et al .",
    "dalal et al . ( 2004 ) repeated the b98 ray tracing analysis of artificial sources using a larger sample of simulated clusters ( of which b98 had used a subset ) and compared their results to the 38-cluster emss sample ( luppino et al .",
    "1999 ) , but concluded that the arc statistics data and the @xmath7cdm model are consistent .",
    "they explained the order of magnitude discrepancy reported by b98 as a combination of several smaller effects : 1 ) the sky density of emss clusters is lower by a factor of 2 than was assumed by b98 ; 2 ) the background source density used by dalal et al . in their calculations",
    "( based on fontana et al .",
    "2000 ) is higher by a factor of 2 than the one used by b98 ; 3 ) the placement of sources at additional redshifts , other than @xmath8 , yields a higher optical depth than the one derived in b98 .",
    "the artificial clusters used by the above studies represent the cluster dark matter component only .",
    "adding a mass component , associated with the dark and baryonic mass of the cluster galaxies , to the artificial clusters can affect the cross section for forming giant arcs in several ways ( meneghetti et al .",
    "the critical lines will curve around the cluster galaxies , thus increasing the cross section .",
    "on the other hand , the galaxies will split some of the long arcs into shorter arclets , thus decreasing the giant arc cross section . after studying these two competing effects , meneghetti et al .",

    "as opposed to using artificial sources at a single redshift , we use real background sources , each at its photometric redshift .",
    "since @xmath126 is no longer constant for a given lens redshift , a single value for the position @xmath123 can not be obtained , given particular values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

( 1999 ) catalog , the number of bright objects per arc - minute peaks near @xmath173 , and the median redshift of bright objects is also @xmath174 . in order to investigate the possibility that the hdf has an atypical redshift distribution due to cosmic variance , we have repeated the simulations , but with all sources at @xmath175 .",
    "we detect a total of @xmath176 arcs and @xmath177 giant luminous arcs , which is an increase of @xmath178 and @xmath179 , respectively , compared to the number of arcs we detect in our standard simulations .",
    "these results are also shown in fig 3 .",
    "thus , there will be a small or modest increase in the predicted number of arcs if in the hdf the characteristic redshifts are anomalously low .",
    "similarly , an atypically low space density of sources in the hdf ( e.g. dickinson 2000 ) , would underpredict the number of arcs .",
    "the observational effects included in our simulations influence the detection process in several ways .",
    "image depth and the local background determine whether a lensed source will be detected .",
    "furthermore , since the lensed sources have real light profiles rather than a constant surface brightness , it is possible that only certain parts of the lensed source are detected . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath14 ratio of an arc with a real light profile , as detected in an image to which observational effects have been added , will sometimes differ from the @xmath14 of the same arc in a noise - free image produced by lensing a source with a constant surface brightness profile .",
    "in addition , the cluster galaxies also affect the results of the detection process .",
    "an arc , or part of it , which lies close to a cluster galaxy will sometimes be misclassified as part of that galaxy .",
    "the arc can also be broken into two separate segments if a galaxy is positioned on top of it .",
    "we also studied the implications of introducing a lower background into our simulated images . applying our arc - finding program to the secondary sample of images , mentioned in @xmath180 , we find that the detection process is affected in several ways : 1 ) in the lower background images , wider parts of the arcs are detected , thus changing their @xmath14 , sometimes below or above the detection threshold of @xmath181 .",
    "+ 2 ) an arc which is detected as two separate arcs in the high - background image can be detected as one continuous arc in the low - background image ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "4 ) . these competing effects seem to largely cancel , as the number of giant arcs and giant luminous arcs in the low - background images was higher by @xmath182 and lower by @xmath183 , respectively , than their number in the higher - background images .",
    "a systematic study of the influence of these and other observational effects will be presented in meneghetti et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "we applied the same arc - finding algorithm described in @xmath27 to the observed sample .",
    "5 shows the relevant image sections and the arcs identified by the arc finder .",
    "a total of 12 arcs with @xmath12 are detected in 7 out of the 10 observed clusters , giving a mean of @xmath184 arcs per cluster .",
    "only two of these arcs are giant luminous arcs , i.e. , a mean of @xmath185 giant luminous arcs per cluster . before comparing these results to the results of the simulated sample we take into consideration the fact that the area in which the observed arcs were detected , covered by the wfpc2 ccds , is only a fraction of the total cluster area . based on the shape of the wfpc2 mosaic",
    ", we have calculated the average effective coverage area as a function of the distance from the cluster center .",
    "we then assign a detection probability to each detected arc in the simulated sample based on the above function , obtaining @xmath186 arcs per cluster and @xmath187 giant luminous arcs per cluster .",
    "our simulated results , both for the total number of giant arcs and for the number of giant luminous arcs , are therefore consistent with the observations to within @xmath188 . examining the observed and the simulated distributions of arc number per cluster",
    ", a kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that the hypothesis that both distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution can be only marginally rejected , with a probability of @xmath189 .",
    "the difference is in the sense that real clusters produce a flatter distribution ",
    "fewer clusters are arcless and more clusters have two giant arcs . as seen in fig .",
    "6 , the small number of observed clusters dominates the uncertainty in the comparison .",
    "larger observed samples can therefore allow more stringent tests .",
    "additional statistical properties are consistent between the observed and simulated samples .",
    "figure @xmath190 compares the distributions of arc lengths , widths , and @xmath14 ratios .",
    "all of them show consistency between the lensing efficiency predicted by the simulated @xmath19 clusters and the observed data .",
    "we have carried out a comparison of the arc - production efficiency of an observed sample of massive clusters , and of a sample of clusters produced in a @xmath2 n - body simulation .",
    "the two samples are roughly matched in mass . in our simulations",
    "we have used a realistic source population , in the form of the hdf , including the number density , surface brightness profiles , and redshifts of the galaxies in it .",
    "we have attempted to simulate the observational effects that may influence arc statistics .",
    "finally , we have carried out an objective comparison of the two samples , not limited by arc brightness , by applying to both samples an automatic arc - finding algorithm .",
    "our main result is that the lensing efficiencies of the observed and the simulated clusters are consistent .",
    "the observed clusters may be somewhat more efficient lenses than the simulated clusters based on the total number of giant arcs they produce , or on the distribution of the number of arcs per cluster , but the differences are marginally significant ( @xmath188 and @xmath191 , respectively ) and could well be due to small number statistics .",
    "the above differences could also be explained if the lensing efficiency correlates with mass , since the observed clusters go to somewhat higher masses than the simulated ones .",
    "we note , however , that the most massive cluster in the observed sample , abell 1835 , has no detected giant arcs , and in the mass range of our observed and simulated clusters the lensing efficiency may have a weak dependence on cluster mass ( e.g. , hennawi et al . 2005 ) .    given that we have used the same @xmath1 n - body cluster sample as b98 , it is instructive to compare our results .",
    "we find that the number of giant luminous arcs produced by the clusters is higher by a factor of @xmath192 than the number obtained by b98 .",
    "the difference can be explained by the different background source densities used by us and by b98 . according to the fern ' andez - soto et al .",
    "( 1999 ) photometric redshift catalog , the density of background sources with @xmath193 mag and @xmath194 is @xmath195 , higher by a factor of @xmath196 than the density assumed by b98 .",
    "this result , by itself , is a major step towards solving the order - of - magnitude problem reported by b98 .",
    "other differences between our work and b98 seem to have little or no influence on the number of giant luminous arcs .",
    "in particular , using a realistic redshift distribution for the background sources , as opposed to placing them all at redshift @xmath8 , results in only a small change in the number of giant luminous arcs .",
    "we should remember that , contrary to other studies that have investigated the effect of source redshift ( e.g. , wambsganss et al .",
    "2004 , dalal et al .",
    "2004 , li et al .",
    "2005 ) , our study also includes simultaneously other effects  source size and surface brightness  which can also be redshift dependent , and which can cancel or reinforce the influence of the redshift on cross section . in any event ,",
    "our simulations , which are more realistic in this respect than previous ones , show that the total number of arcs is weakly affected by placing all sources at @xmath197 ( or at @xmath175 ) , rather than at their true redshifts .    as opposed to previous studies , our approach has allowed us to compare the observations and the theoretical predictions also for less luminous arcs .",
    "as described above , for such arcs , which are several times as numerous as the luminous ones , there is also agreement between the observed and simulated samples , though with a hint for a higher ( factor @xmath198 ) lensing efficiency of the observed sample .",
    "our results point the way to several improvements and extensions that could be implemented in future studies , and which could provide stronger tests of cosmology by means of arc statistics . from the observational aspect ,",
    "the uncertainties in the present work are dominated by the small number of clusters and arcs in the observed sample .",
    "larger samples of clusters , observed to large depth and at higher resolution with the hst advanced camera for surveys , are becoming available , and could be used for this purpose .",
    "furthermore , the effects of cluster selection criteria on arc statistics need to be investigated . for example",
    ", it could be that x - ray luminosity selects clusters that are undergoing merging and that such clusters have enhanced lensing cross - sections .",
    "this could then explain the factor @xmath101 enhancement in lensing efficiency of observed clusters suggested by our results , if this enhancement is confirmed .",
    "arc statistics measured in cluster samples selected by other means ( e.g. , by `` red sequence '' colors ; gladders & yee 2000 ) could test this hypothesis .    on the theoretical side , n - body simulations with higher temporal and spatial resolution can give a more reliable picture of cluster substructure and of the importance of merging events for lensing efficiency .",
    "a larger number of clusters and of projections of each clusters are needed , in view of the large scatter we have found in the number of arcs produced by different clusters and by different projections of the same clusters .",
    "the mass of the cd galaxy , should also be included in the lensing simulations ( meneghetti et al . 2003 ) , as should the cluster gas component ( puchwein et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although the background source population we have used is more realistic then those used by previous studies , this can still be improved .",
    "the hdf covers a small area ( which also forced us to tile it in our simulations ) , and as a results it may be unrepresentative of the typical source density or redshift distribution . furthermore , several more magnitudes of depth would allow probing the source population of lensed arcs more reliably .",
    "the hubble ultra deep field could serve for this purpose , once its photometric redshifts have been measured and calibrated .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that model @xmath2 clusters at @xmath1 have lensing efficiencies similar as to those of observed x - ray selected clusters of similar mass and redshift .",
    "improved arc statistics tests can be based on larger , differently selected , observational samples , and on larger and more sophisticated simulations .",
    "our results do not address the separate issue of whether n - body simulations produce the correct number and mass distribution of clusters as a function of redshift .",
    "although this aspect of the problem was also folded into previous analyses , it would best be examined by means of a direct comparison of the models and the observations , independent of lensing properties .",
    "we thank a. gal - yam and the anonymous referee for comments .",
    "this work was supported by the german israeli foundation for scientific research and development .",
    "in order to allow an objective and quantitative comparison of arc statistics in our simulations and the observed dataset , and to permit arc searches in large real and simulated datasets , we have devised an automatic arc - finding algorithm . as mentioned in @xmath27 , our algorithm",
    "is implemented in a simple script that makes repeated calls to sextractor ( bertin @xmath48 arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the script is written in the c language and utilizes the cfitsio software library ( pence , 1999 ) .",
    "the program is available at http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/  assafh , or on request from the authors .",
    "the outline of our algorithm is as follows .",
    "our algorithm is based on a series of six consecutive detection and elimination sextractor calls , each using slightly different parameters , as listed in table a1 .",
    "after each call , the detected objects which have axis ratios smaller than a set threshold , as listed in table a1 , are eliminated from the detection image .",
    "calls 1 , 3 , and 5 , are applied to the original image , while calls 2 , 4 , and 6 , are applied to the output of calls 1 , 3 , and 5 , in which eliminated objects have been replaced by a constant background .",
    "we then combine the three images produced by calls 2 , 4 , and 6 , into a segmentation image in which all non - zero pixels are assigned a constant value .",
    "we calculate the @xmath14 ratio , as described in @xmath27 , of the objects detected by sextractor in the combined image .",
    "objects below a user - defined @xmath14 threshold are eliminated from the detection image , thus producing a final image of detected arcs .",

    "there is good agreement between the arcs detected by both algorithms .",
    "however , the properties of the detected arcs are different .",

    "arc finder tend to have higher eccentricities , resulting sometimes in false detection of spurious artifacts ( see fig .",
    "15 of lenzen et al .",
    "these `` false positives '' are non - arc objects with intrinsically low eccentricity , but for which the algorithm has isolated a high - eccentricity core . in fig .",
    "a1 , we illustrate the performance of both algorithms on the two different clusters . for the hst image of abell 1689 , also used for illustration by lenzen et al . , close arcs and arcs which lie next to a galaxy are better resolved by the lenzen et al .",

    "these differences in performance are similar to the differences already pointed out by lenzen et al . themselves , when comparing their algorithm to a direct application of sextractor to cluster images .",
