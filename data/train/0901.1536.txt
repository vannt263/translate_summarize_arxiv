    "the formulation of the dynamics of a chain with rigid constraints based on the stochastic equation of langevin has been extensively studied in a series of seminal papers by edwards and goodyear @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to deal with these constraints at the level of stochastic equations is a cumbersome task .",

    "the strategy is to regard the change of the chain conformation as the motion of brownian particles with constrained trajectories .",
    "the framework of the calculations is that of path integrals .",
    "the constraints are introduced by a procedure which is commonly applied in statistical mechanics in order to enforce topological conditions on a system of linked polymers .",

    "recently , this path integral formulation has been connected to the usual description of the dynamics of a chain as a diffusion process @xcite .",

    "the dynamics of a such a chain can be regarded as the motion of a system of coupled pendulums . for the sake of simplicity one of the ends of the chain has been fixed in the origin , see fig .",

    "the chain is called a _",
    "phantom chain_. the fact that the chain is attached at the origin of the coordinates corresponds to the condition @xmath19 or , equivalently : @xmath20 .",

    "in this section the path integral formulation of an inextensible chain in the contact with a heat reservoir at temperature @xmath1 is provided . according to the construction presented in sec .",

    "in other words , the primary task of this section is to analyze the dynamics of a system which consists in the constrained random walk of the beads composing the chain .",
    "the main difficulty in performing analytical calculations are obviously the constraints . starting like in the rouse model from an approach to the problem based on the langevin equation to describe the motion of a polymer in a solution @xcite",
    ", the treatment of the constraints becomes awkward .",
    "for this reason we will use an interdisciplinary strategy , which combines the techniques of field theory with those used in the statistical mechanics of polymers with topological constraints .",
    "the starting point of the presented framework is to specify the probability distribution function @xmath66 expressed in a path integral form .",
    "@xmath66 contains the physical information about the system . to be more specific",
    ", it measures the probability that the chain after a given time @xmath67 passes from an initial configuration @xmath68 to a final configuration @xmath69 .",
    "before we construct the probability function for the chain with rigid constraints , let s see how the path integral of a single free brownian particle looks like .",
    "in order to do this we assume that at the time @xmath60 the particle finds itself at the initial point @xmath70 and starts to perform a random walk .",
    "as it is well known , the probability @xmath71 that , after the time @xmath67 the particle arrives at a given point @xmath72 , satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the diffusion constant .",

    "( [ singleprobfun ] ) satisfies the relation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath1 is the temperature of heat bath and @xmath82 is the relaxation time that characterizes the rate of decay of the drift velocity of the particle .",
    "the above prescription can easily be generalized to a system of @xmath4 noninteracting brownian particles .",
    "it this case the probability that the @xmath83th particle starting from the point @xmath68 arrives at the point @xmath69 is given by @xmath84 \\exp{\\left[-\\frac{1}{2kt\\tau}\\sum_{n=1}^n \\int_0^{t_f}\\frac m2\\dot{\\mathbf r}_n^2(t)dt \\right ] } \\label{totprobfun}\\ ] ] in addition , the form of the path integral on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ totprobfun ] ) displays the connection with the partition function of a set of @xmath4 free particles in quantum mechanics where the functional @xmath85 represents the action of the system .",
    "the well known duality between quantum mechanics and brownian motions allows to treat the factor @xmath86 as the quantity which plays the role of the planck s constant .",
    "indeed , one may show that the uncertainties in the position and momentum of a brownian particle due to the frequent collisions with the molecules in the solutions satisfy an analog of the heisenberg uncertainty relations : @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "going back to the dynamics of an inextensible chain , the only difference with respect to a system of free particles is that the bond vector @xmath53 satisfies the additional constraints ( [ wiezy ] ) restricting the trajectories of motion . to implement them in the dynamics of noninteracting brownian particles",
    "we add a product of functional delta functions in the path integral ( [ totprobfun ] ) which imposes the desired conditions ( [ wiezy ] ) : @xmath88 e^ { -\\frac m{4k_bt\\tau l } \\sum_{n=1}^n a \\int_{0}^{t_f}dt \\dot{\\mathbf r}_n^2(t)}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\prod_{n=2}^n\\delta \\left ( \\frac{\\left| \\mathbf r_n(t)-\\mathbf r_{n-1}(t ) \\right|^2}{a^2}-1 \\right ) \\label{partfunppint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is an irrelevant factor and the mass of a single particle present in eq .",

    "it has been called generalized nonlinear sigma model ( gnl@xmath6 m ) .",
    "the most striking difference between these two models lays in the constraints , which in the case of the nl@xmath6 m are of the form @xmath92 , while in the gnl@xmath6 m they have been replaced by the nonholonomic condition ( [ constrthreecontcase ] ) .    to conclude this section",

    "[ s : class ] in order to treat the dynamics of random chains has some interesting variants which we would like to discuss in this section . to this purpose",
    ", we choose the formulation in which the positions of the ends of the segments composing the chain are given in cartesian coordinates .",
    "as we have already seen , in this way the expression of the kinetic energy @xmath93 is given by ( [ kdisc3dcartcoord ] ) and must be completed by the constraints ( [ constrthreedone ] ) . from now on we assume as before that all segments have the same fixed length @xmath94 , but we require additionally that : @xmath95 this implies that the projection of each segment onto the @xmath0axis has length @xmath96 , so that the segments are bound to form with the @xmath0axis the fixed angles @xmath97 or @xmath98 defined by the relations : @xmath99 clearly , in both cases the constraints ( [ constrthreedone ] ) and ( [ addrequir ] ) may be rewritten as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 may be either @xmath102 or @xmath103 . in the following",
    "we will suppose that only the angle @xmath104 is allowed , so that the chain can not make turns in the @xmath7 direction .",

    "moreover , the total length of the chain is always @xmath58 , but now also the total height @xmath109 of the trajectory along the @xmath0axis is fixed : @xmath110 at this point , we pass to the continuous limit , this time taking as parameter describing the trajectory of the chain the variable @xmath7 instead of the arc - length @xmath57 . due to the last of eqs .",
    "( [ coordsab ] ) , the @xmath0components of the velocities are always zero : @xmath111 as a consequence , we are left with something similar to a two - dimensional problem . the difference from a real two - dimensional problem , which could be obtained by putting @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) in eq .",
    "( [ posns3d ] ) , is that the equations describing the position of a bead in two dimensions , namely @xmath114 and @xmath115 , have been replaced by eqs .",
    "( [ varonedf ] ) and ( [ vartwodf ] ) . moreover , the constraints have a slightly different form . following the same procedure presented in sec .",
    "[ s : class ] , we find after a few calculations the expression of the kinetic energy in the continuous limit : @xmath116 and of the constraint ( [ constralpha ] ) : @xmath117 it is also not difficult to show that the probability distribution @xmath118 is given in cartesian coordinates by : @xmath119 where @xmath120 \\label{djfjskdflds}\\ ] ]    at this point we discuss briefly the case in which both angles @xmath121 and @xmath101 are allowed . in this situation , the trajectory of the chain may have turns .",

    "turning points are emphasized by means of shaded beads . ]",
    "the constraints ( [ constrthreedone ] ) and ( [ addrequir ] ) remain unchanged , but the coordinate @xmath7 can not be chosen as a valid parameter of the trajectory of the chain and one has to come back to the arc - length @xmath57 .",
    "the most serious problem is the fact that the variables @xmath122 are not continuous functions of the time , since the length @xmath123 is allowed to jump discretely between the two discrete values @xmath124 and @xmath125 , corresponding to the angles @xmath101 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "it is therefore difficult to define the components @xmath126 of the velocities of the ends of the segments and thus their contribution to the kinetic energy .",
    "let us note that this problem affects only the @xmath7 degrees of freedom .",
    "the degrees of freedom @xmath127 and @xmath128 of the chain remain continuous functions of @xmath55 despite the jumps of the @xmath129 s . this fact can be easily verified looking at the definition of @xmath127 and @xmath128 in eqs .",
    "( [ varonedf ] ) and ( [ vartwodf ] ) .",
    "since @xmath130 , both the @xmath127 s and @xmath128 s are not affected by the jumps of the angle @xmath131 .",
    "as a consequence , the problems with the @xmath7 variable can easily be solved if the chain has no interactions in which the @xmath7 variable is involved . in this case , in fact , the degrees of freedom connected to the motion along the @xmath0direction are decoupled from the other degrees of freedom and may be neglected .    as a consequence , we assume that the interactions are @xmath0independent , so that the difficulties related to the motion along the @xmath0direction disappear and once again the problem reduces to that that of a two - dimensional chain . since the constraints are always those of eqs .",
    "( [ constrthreedone ] ) and ( [ addrequir ] ) , one may proceed as in the case of fixed angle @xmath101 . as a result",
    ", one finds that the final probability distribution is of the form : @xmath132 where @xmath133 \\label{djfjskdfldws}\\ ] ] and @xmath134 is a constant containing the result of the integration over the decoupled @xmath7 degrees of freedom . with respect to the previous case ,",
    "let us note that in eqs .",
    "( [ 3ddirfiwn ] ) and ( [ djfjskdfldws ] ) @xmath7 has been replaced by the arc - length @xmath57 as the parameter of the trajectory of the chain .",
    "correspondingly , the total chain length @xmath25 appears in the action instead of the height @xmath109 .",
    "in this work the dynamics of an inextensible freely jointed chain consisting of links and beads in three dimensions has been discussed both from the classical and statistical point of view . in sec .",
    "[ s : class ] we have mainly concentrated ourselves on the computation of the kinetic energy in cartesian and spherical coordinates for the discrete and continuous chain . in sec .",
    "[ s : heatbath ] we have derived the probability function of the chain @xmath135 using a path integral framework and the fact that the fluctuations of the chain can be regarded as those of a system of brownian particles with an additional constraint condition imposed on their trajectories . the probability function @xmath135 of this system is equivalent to the partition function of a generalized nonlinear @xmath6 model .",
    "the analogy of the gnl@xmath6 m with the nl@xmath6 m suggests the possibility of applying techniques and results coming from the nl@xmath6 m to the gnl@xmath6 m .",
    "for example , it is known that the nl@xmath6 m is renormalizable in two dimensions and also that it has interesting features because it is analytically free and has a dynamically generated mass gap @xcite .",
    "the similarity with nl@xmath6 m seems also to suggest that there is no symmetry breaking in the underlying @xmath136 symmetry of the gnl@xmath6 m , where @xmath137 denotes the dimension of the vector field @xmath138 .",
    "one should however be careful when extending the results of the nl@xmath6 m to the gnl@xmath6 m .",
    "for example if @xmath139 , one may use polar field coordinates to express the vector field @xmath138 . if one does that the nl@xmath6 m becomes a free field theory in the angle variable @xcite .",
    "this is not true in the case of the gnl@xmath6 m which in polar coordinates exhibits a nonlinear and complicated dependence on the angle degree of freedom .",
    "moreover , it is not straightforward to apply techniques like the effective potential method which is useful to investigate possible phase transitions in the nl@xmath6 m .",
    "the reason is that in this method it is performed an expansion around field configurations minimalizing the action which are constant .",
    "configurations of this kind correspond in the gnl@xmath6 m to the situation in which the chain has collapsed to a point and thus are nonphysical . finally in sec .",
    "[ s:3dcb ] a three - dimensional chain admitting only fixed angles with respect to the @xmath0axis has been discussed .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to reduce the problem to two dimensions , in a way which is similar to the reduction of the statistical mechanics of a directed polymer to the random walk of a two - dimensional particle @xcite .",
    "our approach is valid only if the chain has no turning points .",
    "if there are turning points the kinetic energy is not well defined , because the variable @xmath140 is no longer a continuous function and thus its time derivative becomes a distribution .",
    "one way for adding to our treatment turning points as those of fig .",
    "[ turnedchain ] is to replace the variable @xmath7 with a stochastic variable which is allowed to take only discrete values .",
