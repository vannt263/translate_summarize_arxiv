    "one of the most fundamental processes in light - matter interaction is the attenuation of light by matter .",
    "the introduced weakening of light is observed since ancient times . today , in modern nano - optics , it is possible to perform controlled experiments with single entities , i.e.  single photons  @xcite and single emitters  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of this optical interaction does not only address very fundamental questions , it also allows the optimization of the efficiency in light - matter interaction .",
    "the spectroscopy and optical research on single emitters in the past was engineered for optimal light - extraction strategies  @xcite , such that e.g.  a single molecule or a nano - crystal can be detected by fluorescence with a good signal to noise ratio .",
    "but it was rarely optimized to achieve the most efficient excitation . for optical protocols , such as the quantum phase gate , or coherent microscopy schemes  @xcite ,",
    "an efficient interaction of a single photon to an external field , ideally a single photon , is desirable .",
    "experimentally , single molecules  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , and atoms  @xcite were researched in the past decade for their ability to attenuate a light beam .",
    "the solid state experiments were initially conducted under cryogenic conditions  @xcite .",
    "only balanced detection made it possible to extend these fundamental studies to room temperature  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the experimental realization of these fundamental processes , numerous theoretical approaches were reinvented  @xcite , often founded on electrodynamic calculations from the 1960s when the field of antenna theory was very active .",
    "one central question was the maximum amount of extinction in a real optical focus  @xcite .",
    "others describe the energy relations in the context of the optical theorem and in the near - field  @xcite .",
    "the energy flow itself , depicted as streamlines of the poynting vector , introduced a vivid insight in this fundamental problem already decades ago  @xcite .",
    "today , we see the most fundamental approaches are getting unified between classical antenna theory , quantum technologies and nano - optics .",
    "in this paper we review the fundamental basics of coherent light - matter interaction and absorption of a single emitter .",
    "the relevant cross sections of absorption , extinction and scattering are analytically derived from first principles .",
    "everything is extended to the mathematical description of the energy flow in the proximity of a dipolar emitter .",
    "while this was discussed already in the past decade , we address shortcomings and present novel findings .",
    "the cross sections are calculated , and the analytic result and their derivation by following the energy flow are compared . in the close proximity of the dipole the total field",
    "is altered by the presence of the emitter .",
    "this change also alters the effective cross sections .",
    "the ( optical ) near - field cross sections become more and more a dipolar shape . whereas the dipolar emitter was assumed as a linear , hertzian , dipole in many papers , we see the experimental efforts extended to single atoms  @xcite , which usually exhibit a circular dipole .",
    "therefore , we adapt the underlying math to the case of a circular dipole .",
    "we approach the relevant math with an intuitive picture of the fundamental process of light - matter interaction . to that end",
    "we study the most basic case , given by the interaction of an incident plane wave with a single dipole .",
    "a single dipole emitter is assumed in free space at the origin of a coordinate system ( fig .",

    "the contributions of the incident wave are obvious and equivalent ( resp .  with different signs ) for the two half spheres .",
    "the scattered energy is greater than zero and has the same amount in both directions i.e.  the same amount of power is scattered in the forward and backward direction as expected ( dipole radiation ) . the contributions which may not be directly intuitive are the extinction terms .",
    "the results of the integration over @xmath29 is shown in fig .",

    "the sum of the two parts in the forward and the backward direction always yield to zero as expected by energy conservation .    since extinction is given by the sum of absorption and scattering it is computed by the total amount of energy extracted from the incident field by the emitter .",
    "we consider the time averaged power extracted by the dipole by  @xcite @xmath40    here , @xmath41 is the electric current density ( a harmonic time dependence @xmath42 was used ) . for eqn .",

    "[ fig:08]a the simulation data satisfies the theoretical forecast ( which is exactly the same as for the linear case ) for a circular excitation as well .",

    "[ fig:07 ] . ]    comparing the situations for the hertzian and the circular dipole it is visible that both mathematical descriptions nicely yield a result which satisfies the underlying theory , independent of the incident wave polarization . whereas the energy flow for the different cases differs totally , but it always fulfills the boundary conditions that the `` total area '' of the absorption cross section yields to a corresponding result .",
    "thus , it might be questionable how meaningful the energy flow itself is . especially , since the definition of the poynting vector is not unique .",
    "but the results of the simulation provided in the current paper may give an intuitive picture how light absorption occurs .",
    "for the hertzian dipole , it was determined , that the effective far - field aperture is altered in the optical near - field .",

    "the apertures are not circularly symmetric .",
    "the absorption cross - section is fully equivalent in both cases .",
