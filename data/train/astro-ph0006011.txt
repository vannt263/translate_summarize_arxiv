    "several stellar and extragalactic astrophysical systems have been observed to exhibit collimated outflows in the form of jets ( young stellar objects , low and high mass x - ray binaries , black hole x - ray transients , symbiotic stars , planetary nebulae nuclei , supersoft x - ray sources , active galactic nuclei and quasars ) . in recent reviews of observations from all such classes of astrophysical objects",
    "it has been argued that an interconnecting element may be a rotating accretion disk threaded by a magnetic field ( livio 1999 , knigl & pudritz , 1999 ) .",
    "such connection between the disk and the jet is particularly evident in hst observations of several young stars in the nearby orion nebula ( ray 1996 ) .",
    "this rather convincing observational evidence of a close jet - disk relation is the basis for the presently prevailing view that an accretion disk is the necessary ingredient for the production of collimated jets .",
    "on the other hand , theoretically it has been shown for quite some time by now that gas outflows from a rotating magnetized object of any nature can be magnetically self - collimated to form a jet ( heyvaerts & norman 1989 , chiueh et al 1991 , sauty & tsinganos 1994 , bogovalov 1995 ) .",
    "this result seems to be a rather intrinsic property of magnetized winds with polytropic thermodynamics or not , where the self - compression of the plasma is provided by the toroidal magnetic field induced by the rotation of the central source .",
    "henceforth emerges the generally accepted opinion that all observed jets are magnetically collimated ( livio 1999 ) .",
    "however , no direct observational evidence exists today that most observed jets are indeed collimated solely by magnetic fields .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that the toroidal magnetic field is unstable and can not collimate the jet effectively ( spruit et al .",
    "1997 , lucek & bell 1997 ) and it has been argued that magnetized winds do not collimate without an external help , such as the channelling effects of a thick accretion disk and/or confinement from the ambient medium ( okamoto 1999 ) .",
    "it is thus crucially important to find direct observational evidence that the magnetic field mainly collimates the plasma in observed jets and by this way to test the theory of magnetic collimation .",
    "nevertheless , plasma outflows do also emanate from isolated magnetized and rotating stars without an accretion disk , of which the solar wind ( sw ) is the classical and best studied example .",
    "the natural question which arises then is to what observable degree dynamical effects are capable to collimate outflows from such single stars too .",
    "theoretical studies on the angular momentum evolution of solar - type stars have concluded that at the end of the early accretion phase ( ptts ) the star may be span up by more than 10 times the present solar rotation rate while its magnetic field is also strong ( bouvier et al .",
    "1997 ) . and ,",
    "in recent studies it has been shown that cold winds from such rapidly rotating and highly magnetized stars lead to considerable collimation of the outflow ( bogovalov & tsinganos 1999 , henceforth paper i ) .",
    "similar is the result from studies of hot plasma outflows from efficient magnetic rotators ( sauty & tsinganos 1994 , sauty et al .",
    "1999 ) . hence , observation of the collimation effect in outflows from single stars could be the most reliable observational test of the theory of magnetic collimation .",
    "the question of the degree of collimation of the sw is an interesting possibility that has not been fully answered theoretically and observationally for quite some time now .",
    "suess ( 1972 ) and nerney & suess ( 1975 ) were the first to model the axisymmetric interaction of magnetic fields with rotation in stellar winds by a linearisation of the mhd equations in inverse rossby numbers and to find a poleward deflection of the streamlines of the solar wind caused by the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "later , sakurai ( 1985 ) addressed the same problem by numerically solving the system of the polytropic mhd equations for the stationary outflow .",
    "washimi & shibata ( 1993 ) modelled time dependent axisymmetric thermo - centrifugal winds with a _ dipole",
    "_ magnetic flux distribution on the stellar surface and a radial field in washimi & sakurai ( 1993 ) .",
    "polytropic mhd simulations of magnetized winds containing both a `` wind '' and a `` dead '' zone ( tsinganos & low 1989 , mestel 1999 ) have also been performed up to distances of 0.25 au ( keppens & goedbloed 1999 ) .",
    "all these studies show some small deflection of the flow toward the axis of rotation .    in the observational front , information on the degree of collimation of the sw",
    "can be inferred from anisotropies in the lyman alpha emission .",
    "these solar uv photons are scattered by neutral h atoms of interstellar origin and where the sw mass flux is increased the neutral h atoms are destroyed and thus the lyman alpha emission is reduced .",
    "early observations by the mariner 10 ( kumar & broadfoot 1979 ) and prognoz ( bertaux et al .",
    "1985 ) satellites have shown that there is less lyman alpha emission near the equator in comparison to the ecliptic poles , than predicted by an isotropic sw ( bertaux et al .",
    "therefore , these lyman alpha observations imply that the sw mass efflux should be maximum at the equator and minimum at the poles .",
    "the same trend is confirmed by _ in situ _ observations of ulysses ( goldstein et al . 1996 ) and the swan instrument onboard of the soho spacecraft ( kyrl et al .",
    "however , the effect of sw collimation around the ecliptic poles would cause the opposite effect on lyman alpha observations .",
    "in other words , although uv observations infer a sw mass efflux peaked at the equator , magnetic collimation would cause a sw mass efflux peaked at the poles , for an isotropic at the base wind .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to resolve this paradox .",
    "we shall follow the idea of magnetic collimation of the sw and show which values of the parameters characterizing the heliolatitudinal dependance of the sw ( lima et al .",
    "1997 , gallagher et al .",
    "1999 ) , such as density , bulk flow speed , mass efflux , etc are consistent with the observations by the lyman alpha method .",
    "furthermore , we shall follow the increase of the degree of collimation of a hot stellar wind by increasing the rotation rate of the star and show that a ten - fold increase of angular velocity , as is the case in the majority of the young rapid rotators , leads to a dramatic increase of the degree of stellar wind collimation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we justify the use of a split monopole model in our analysis for the collimation properties of the realistic solar wind at large distances from the sun . in order to establish notation in sect .",
    "3 we give briefly the basic equations describing a stationary and polytropic parker wind . in sect .",
    "4 , the initial configuration used together with the boundary conditions for the numerical simulation in the nearest zone are discussed . in sect .",
    "5 the analytical method for extending the integration to unlimited large distances outside the near zone is briefly described while in sect .",
    "6 the parametrization of the presented solutions is given . in sect",
    "7 we discuss the results for the isotropic sw in the near zone containing the critical surfaces and in the asymptotic regime of the collimated outflow , for a uniform rotation . in sect .",
    "8 the case of a stellar wind from a star rotating faster than the sun is taken up . a brief summary with a discussion of the main results is finally given in sect . 9 .",
    "1a is a sketch of the magnetic field structure in the corona of a star .",
    "close to the stellar base the structure of the magnetosphere may be rather complicated . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the study of winds at distances much larger than the radius of the star where no closed field lines exist .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to consider the plasma flow starting at distances shown in fig .",
    "1a by the dashed line .",
    "for the solar wind the location of this surface can be put somewhere between the slow magnetosonic surface and the alfvnic surface .",
    "we choose this location of the starting surface to avoid the solution of the problem of the wind acceleration in the very vicinity of the star which is defined not only by thermal pressure gradients but also by nonthermal processes of acceleration where the acceleration mechanisms have not still studied sufficienty well and are beyond the scope of the present study ( e.g. , see holzer & leer 1997 , hansteen et al .",
    "1997 , wang et al .",
    "1998 ) . above this base surface",
    "we can assume that the dynamics of the wind is mainly controlled by thermal and electromagnetic forces .",
    "in this approach the density and velocity of the plasma , together with the tangential components of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field are specified on this base surface while the tangential components of the magnetic field are free .    nevertheless , the solution of this problem is still too complicated .",
    "open poloidal magnetic field lines go to infinity and change their direction on the so called current sheets , some of which are indicated with dotted lines in fig .",
    "these current sheets are present in any realistic wind from a stellar atmosphere , since the total magnetic flux of the open poloidal magnetic field lines is equal to zero while the mass loss rate is finite .",
    "the invariance principle summarized in the appendix in a form appropriate to hot winds in a gravitational field allows us to simplify the structure of the magnetic field in the wind ( bogovalov 1999 ) . according to this principle",
    ", we can reverse the direction of some field lines so that the magnetic field is unipolar in each hemisphere , e.g. , outward in the upper and inwards in the lower hemisphere . in ideal mhd",
    "wherein we neglect all dissipative processes such as magnetic reconnection , this operation does not affect the dynamics of the plasma as long as the streamlines are not modified .",
    "this results in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "1b where since we are not interested in the region upstream of the base surface , this region is not shown .",
    "in this structure the current sheet is located only around the equatorial plane . to proceed , we further assume that the distribution of the normal component of the poloidal magnetic field is uniform in the upper and lower hemispheres . in that case",
    "we get the model of the axisymmetric rotator with an initially split - monopole magnetic field .",
    "the field lines are magnetically focused toward the system s axis , as shown in fig .",
    "we would like to stress that the model of the axisymmetric rotator describes not only axisymmetric outflows but also a wide class of nonstationary and axially nonsymmetric outflows .",
    "this is due to the fact that according to the invariance principle ( c.f .",
    "appendix ) the change of the direction of a magnetic field line in some flux tube does not affect the dynamics of the plasma .",
    "for example , let s assume that we obtain a solution for the axisymmetric rotator , as shown schematically in fig . 2a .",
    "then , a reversal of the sign of some magnetic field lines in an arbitrary poloidal flux tube gives us a solution which is not axisymmetric and nonstationary , as shown in fig .",
    "this is a solution for the plasma outflow from a rotator with uniform magnetic field at the base surface but with a magnetic spot of the opposite polarity on the upper hemisphere .",
    "2b shows the cross - section of such a magnetic field by the poloidal plane .",
    "the stream lines are the same as for the axisymmetric case .",
    "but the poloidal magnetic field changes sign in magnetic spots corresponding to the flux tube of the opposite polarity .",
    "the path of the field line in this flux tube in 3d is shown by a dashed line .",
    "these spots propagate in the poloidal plane with the velocity of the plasma and hence the pattern is nonstationary .",
    "it is clear that the number of such magnetic spots and their position at the base surface can be arbitrary .",
    "therefore the study of the plasma outflow in the model of the axisymmetric rotator with an initially split - monopole magnetic field allows us to study a much more wider classes of nonstationary and nonaxisymmetric flows .",
    "a parker wind is taken as the initial state ( t=0 ) for the solution of the time - dependent problem . in this initial state ,",
    "the wind is assumed to flow along the radial magnetic field lines of an isotropic magnetic field ( parker 1963 ) , although in general , the flow is not isotropic such that the wind has its own integrals of motion on every stream line @xmath0 . for simplicity , a polytropic relationship between the pressure @xmath1 and the density @xmath2 is assumed @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the polytropic index .",
    "then , the bernoulli equation for energy conservation along a radial line in such an anisotropic wind from a nonrotating star has the form @xmath5    denote by @xmath6 the terminal velocity of the plasma on each fieldline . in order to get equations in dimensionless variables",

    "then , eq . ( [ mass ] ) gives the density @xmath45 once the mass flux @xmath46 accross the poloidal streamlines is given .",
    "note that in order to finally calculate the physical variables @xmath47 and @xmath2 we need in addition , as input parameter of the problem , the equatorial sound speed @xmath14 while @xmath12 can be calculated from the given @xmath48 .",
    "finally , consider the initial radial magnetic field @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the magnetic field at the equatorial sonic transition . to define a dimensionless magnetic field , @xmath51 , we need to normalize @xmath52 to some characteristic value @xmath53 which we choose to be given by the condition @xmath54 .",
    "the dimensionless magnetic field @xmath55 then has the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the alfvnic velocity at the equatorial sonic point .",
    "evidently , the strength of the initial dimensionless magnetic field is controlled by the magnitude of the ratio of the alfvn and sound speeds at the equatorial sonic distance , @xmath58 .",
    "to obtain a stationary solution of the problem in the nearest zone of the star containing the sonic critical surface , it is needed to solve the complete system of the time - dependent mhd equations and look for an asymptotic stationary state .",
    "then , the plasma flow in a gravitational field with the thermal pressure included is described by the following set of the familiar mhd equations ,    @xmath59    @xmath60    @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65    where we have used cylindrical coordinates @xmath66 and the magnetic field b has a poloidal magnetic flux denoted by @xmath67 . in the simulation we assumed a polytropic equation of state , so that the relationship of pressure and density in the plasma is @xmath68 , at any point along the flow .",
    "a correct solution of the problem requires a specification of the appropriate boundary conditions at the base surface . in this paper",
    "our main intention is to compare our results with observations at large distances from the source . in other words , we are interested in the asymptotic properties of the plasma flow in stellar winds .",

    "we avoid the problems connected with the correct description of the acceleration of the flow below the slow mode critical surface .",
    "nevertheless , our boundary sourface will be placed below the alfvn and fast mode critical surfaces .",
    "the correct passage of the physical solution from these two critical surfaces will yield the appropriate values of the toroidal component of the magnetic field which is important in controlling the process of outflow collimation .",

    "the importance of a correct specification of the outer boundary conditions in mhd outflows has been emphasized previously in bogovalov ( 1996 , 1997 ) where we controlled the position of the outer boundary in the region where no signal can propagate from this boundary into the box of the simulation .",
