    "quantum control of many - body states is essential for new quantum technology applications .",
    "ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices provide an excellent system to probe the coherent dynamical control of multiparticle states .",
    "a paradigm of the coherent control of cold atoms in optical lattices was provided by the superfluid ( sf ) to mott - insulator ( mi ) transition via adiabatic ramping of the lattice potential @xcite .",
    "more recently , a theoretical proposal @xcite to drive a sf - mi transition by using a fast oscillatory force has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite . in this work",
    "we analyze the role played by disorder for interacting atoms in a lattice in the presence of a fast non - resonant oscillatory potential .",
    "the coherent dynamics of tight - binding systems in the presence of external fields is a very timely subject and includes phenomena such as bloch oscillations , wannier - stark localization , caused by static fields , or dynamical localization due to the interaction with ac fields @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenvectors of a quantum particle in a periodic lattice are bloch waves",
    ". the corresponding eigenvalues form energy bands , and a single particle is delocalized over the lattice .",
    "dunlap and kenkre @xcite showed that an external ac field localizes the particle when the ratio of the field magnitude and the field frequency is a root of the ordinary bessel function of order zero .",
    "the use of floquet theory gives rise to a great conceptual simplification @xcite ; the structure of the quasienergy bands depends on the parameters of the time - dependent external perturbation and therefore by fine tuning the amplitude and frequency of the field , tunneling and the consequent localization phenomena can be manipulated .",
    "the dynamical suppression of tunneling persists in the presence of interactions @xcite and it was proposed to induce localization for a single particle in the presence of disorder @xcite . here",
    ", we combine the fast oscillatory force , the interactions between atoms , and disorder for a one - dimensional tight - binding system .",
    "the interplay between disorder - induced localization and interactions is one of the main open issues in condensed matter physics . in the context of bosonic atoms trapped in optical lattices",
    "it has risen much interest in recent years @xcite and the exact ground state phase diagram of the disordered bose - hubbard ( bh ) model is still an open question @xcite . for commensurate fillings and strong interactions in the absence of disorder , there exist insulating mi states characterized by an integer fixed number of bosons per lattice site and a gap in the excitation spectrum . in the presence of disorder an additional insulating phase appears , the bose - glass ( bg ) phase characterized by a gapless excitation spectrum and finite compressibility . for weak interactions and strong disorder an anderson - glass ( ag ) may appear where one or more condensates localize in anderson states .",
    "it has been shown previously that adiabatic ramping of a fast oscillatory force can drive an ordered system with commensurate filling from a superfluid regime into the localized regime as it effectively reduces and even suppresses the tunneling between neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "this force periodic in time but constant in space can be produced in the laboratory through an effective acceleration induced by a linear - in - time dephasing of the lasers forming the optical lattice @xcite . by changing appropriately the parameters of this acceleration , its amplitude and frequency ,",
    "it becomes possible to control the transitions between different states of the bh hamiltonian .",
    "we show here that adiabatic quantum evolution towards a localized state is still possible in the presence of disorder both for commensurate and non - commensurate fillings .",
    "the structure of the quasienergy levels becomes more complex when disorder is introduced .",
    "the breakdown of degeneracies eliminates spectral gaps giving rise to a denser spectrum , and in principle adiabatic evolution could be spoiled at least for reasonable time scales .    in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian and the floquet theory used to describe the dynamics of the system .",
    "section [ sec : results ] discusses the time scales needed for inducing a transition into localized states for different ratios of the interaction and disorder strength . for commensurate",
    "filling we find that in spite of the breaking of symmetries induced by disorder , the time scale needed for adiabatic evolution is similar for an ordered and a disordered system .",
    "localization is not possible for an ordered system with non - commensurate filling via the adiabatic ramping of the fast oscillatory potential @xcite .",
    "we show that the breaking of symmetries induced by the disorder potential makes localization possible even at similar time scales than for the commensurate system .",
    "we also show how the adiabatic time scale shortens for increasing disorder strengths . finally , we discuss the implications of our exact small system calculations for systems of experimentally relevant sizes . in section",
    "[ sec : concl ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we consider the dynamics of @xmath0 atoms trapped in the lowest bloch band of an optical lattice at sufficiently low temperatures such that it can be described by the bh model .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is ( taking @xmath1 throughout ) @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the bosonic destruction operator for an atom localized in lattice site @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is the tunneling matrix element , @xmath7 is the on - site repulsive interaction , while @xmath8 $ ] denotes a site - dependent random external potential of strength @xmath9 and @xmath10 accounts for the external parabolic trap .",
    "depending on the ratios @xmath11 and @xmath12 the ground states of @xmath13 show very different properties and , for large enough @xmath0 , different parameter values span the phase - diagram of the multiparticle system .    for @xmath14 , one can span the sf - mi quantum phase transition by changing the ratio @xmath12 . in the limit",
    "@xmath15 the tunneling dominates and the system is sf , while for @xmath16 the repulsive interactions dominate and the system is an insulator , with a gapped spectrum . for @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "the system is an insulator , but depending on the ratio @xmath11 and the mean occupation number @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the total length of the system , always odd in our calculations ) , the ground state is either a bg or a mi .",
    "both states are localized , in the sense that there is no transport through the lattice , and thus the density matrix has exponentially decaying off - diagonal terms .",
    "what distinguishes both phases @xcite is the structure of the spectrum , which is gapped for a mi while it is not for a bg . when disorder dominates @xmath21 the ground state is a bg , while for @xmath22 different theoretical methods predict a mi or a bg ground insulator state depending on the mean occupation number @xcite . for small disorder , in the regime @xmath15 , the system is sf with long - range coherence while in the region @xmath23 , the system condenses to an anderson state @xcite localized in the regions of strong disorder .",
    "these properties do not smear out in the presence of a shallow trapping potential .",
    "we impose a linear potential @xmath24 across the lattice which oscillates in time @xcite and the total hamiltonian @xmath25 is then periodic with period @xmath26 .",
    "the floquet theorem establishes that , due to the periodicity of the hamiltonian , the solutions to the schrdinger equation @xmath27 are linear combinations of functions of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 . inserting eq .",
    "( [ psiphi ] ) into the schrdinger equation one obtains the eigenvalue equation @xmath30 where the floquet hamiltonian is defined as @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the quasienergy of the system . as pointed out by sambe @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ feigenval ] ) can be solved using the standard techniques developed for time - independent hamiltonians , provided we extend the hilbert space to include the space of time - periodic functions .",
    "a suitable basis for this extended hilbert space @xmath33 is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a basis for the hilbert space @xmath36 of the system , and we define @xmath37 with @xmath38 integer , as the basis functions in the vector space @xmath39 of time periodic functions . in this basis , eq .  ( [ feigenval ] ) becomes a matrix eigenvalue equation of infinite dimension with an infinite number of eigenvalues .",
    "it can be proven that if @xmath40 is an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector @xmath41 , then @xmath42 with @xmath43 integer is also an eigenvalue with corresponding eigenvector @xmath44= @xmath45 .",
    "accordingly , the eigenstates @xmath44 and @xmath46 describe the same state in @xmath36 apart from a global phase .",
    "thus , in order to describe the time evolution in the hilbert space we need only to solve the floquet eigenvalue equation for @xmath47 $ ] called first brillouin zone in analogy to the theory of periodic crystals .",
    "it can be shown that there are @xmath48 distinct quasienergy states in the first brillouin zone , if the hilbert space @xmath36 is @xmath48-dimensional .",
    "the set of cyclic wave packets @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ psiphi ] ) obtained from the floquet eigenstates provides a complete orthogonal basis in @xmath36 at each @xmath50 .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation is then @xmath51 where @xmath52 from now on the term cyclic state refers to @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the beginning of a period .",
    "we are interested in a regime in which @xmath55 is smaller than the energy separation to higher energy bands , so that our single - band bh model of eq.([eq : bhm ] ) is still valid , but it is larger than the rest of the relevant energy scales of our system , i.e. @xmath56 . in this high - frequency regime",
    ", one can show than the effect of the time - periodic external potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is to renormalize the tunneling term . to restore the lattice symmetry broken by the time - dependent potential it is useful to introduce a vector potential @xmath57 and transform the solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation as @xmath58}\\psi(t)$ ] .",
    "note that the tunneling terms , combination of creation and destruction operators on neighboring sites , acquire a non - trivial phase .",
    "on the other hand , the space dependent phase induced by the vector potential cancels out in the interaction and disorder terms , as they only depend on creation and destruction operators on the same site . in the limit",
    "@xmath59 one can average the phase over one period and show that the time - periodic external potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) leads for @xmath60 to an effective time - independent hamiltonian similar to @xmath13 with an effective tunneling @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the bessel function of zero order . for finite but high - frequencies @xmath56 , the hamiltonian @xmath13 with the approximate effective tunneling rate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jbessel ] ) still describes with high accuracy the cyclic states of the time periodic hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) at @xmath54 . for the zeroes of the bessel function , the tunneling rate ,",
    "although not exactly zero , is very much suppressed .",
    "note that in this work we do exact time dependent calculations and do not use the effective hamiltonian approximation . as shown below this approximation",
    "is very accurate and the main effect of the time - dependent potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : v ] ) is to produce a renormalization of the effective tunneling in the lattice .    for an ordered lattice ( @xmath14 ) the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) drives a transition @xcite from an initial sf state into a mi state by adiabatically ramping the potential @xmath63 to a value @xmath64 , which corresponds to the first zero of the bessel function , where @xmath65 . in a disordered one - dimensional lattice with no interactions",
    "this oscillatory force can be used for increasing the localization of particles in the anderson state in the regime of fast oscillations @xcite , while for slow oscillations , it can be used to decrease the localization @xcite .    here , we combine the oscillatory driving force , the random potential , and the interatomic interactions to explore the possibility of localizing interacting particles not only in a mi state , but also in other insulating states .",
    "we explore in a controlled fashion the full parametric dependence of the ground state of interacting bosons in the presence of disorder . as we can effectively control the value of the effective tunneling matrix elements between the lattice sites we can move between the different states in the diagonal lines of the corresponding phase diagram @xmath12",
    "vs. @xmath66 ( i.e. we keep @xmath67 constant while changing the effective @xmath12 ) . for this control through external periodic forces to be of any use , one should take into account the velocity of the ramping needed for the transition between states to take place .",
    "if one increases the amplitude of the external force adiabatically the system follows the eigenstates ( cyclic states ) of the floquet hamiltonian .",
    "we show that adiabatic behavior can be achieved for realistic parameters of our system .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in the regime where the disorder dominates , the condensate state which appears for large values of @xmath69 is not extended over the whole space , contrary to previous cases .",
    "for @xmath69 large , the ground state is a condensate localized in the region of the lattice most distorted by the disorder .",
    "this localized condensed state which appears in our small system resembles the properties of ag states appearing in larger systems @xcite , where particles condense into localized anderson states with an exponential decay distributed across the lattice in different islands .",
    "we calculate the one - particle density matrix of the initial ground state for @xmath70 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] e ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the one - particle density matrix ( inset of fig.[fig : spec ] b ) ) show that only one state is macroscopically occupied .",
    "this state , shown in fig.[fig : spec ] b ) , decays exponentially in space . the quasienergy spectrum and the momentum distribution of the evolved state depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : agbg ] , show that the system evolves from a state with finite condensate fraction into an insulating state .",
    "note that for bigger system sizes , both the initial and final states are insulating , and our fast oscillatory force is able to drive a transition from states with off - diagonal terms in the one - particle density matrix around the deepest sites of the lattice into states with only diagonal terms in the one - particle density matrix , as shown in fig.[fig : dens ] .",
    "this final diagonal states appearing for @xmath71 resemble bg insulating states .",
    "the one - particle density matrix shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] peaks around the deepest lattice site and looses its off - diagonal elements when the system becomes maximally localized .",
    "for @xmath72 we observe that the ground state remains always the ground cyclic state of the quasienergy structure shown in fig.[fig : sfbg ] for ramps with @xmath73 which would mean @xmath74s . in this regime when @xmath66 is large , the quasienergy spectrum in fig . [",
    "fig : agbg ] is dominated by disorder for all values of the ramping potential @xmath75 .",
    "even at @xmath76 when the tunneling is largest @xmath77 the hopping is mainly taking place around the deepest potential well .    for larger system sizes , where the deepest sites are in principle far away",
    ", the ground state would be a proliferation of islands of the type considered here .",
    "the near energy states appearing in the spectrum as the system size is increased are not connected by the nearest neighbor tunneling matrix term of the hamiltonian and one can therefore expect that the ag - bg - type transition on each island takes place independently .",
    "we thus expect that the transition between ground states can be realized adiabatically within experimentally feasible time scales .",
    "when the system size increases the quasienergy spectrum becomes more and more dense .",
    "the requirement of high frequencies is that @xmath78 and thus when @xmath0 increases the quasienergies of the high energy states can cross that of the ground state ; i.e. the frequency @xmath55 may in principle induce resonances between different states . yet",
    "the states which are coupled by @xmath55 have very different occupation number patterns and do not have any effective overlap .",
    "this type of accidental crossings are traversed diabatically for any physically relevant time scale as discussed in @xcite .",
    "all the adiabatic time scales calculated in this work involve very small particle numbers .",
    "due to computational restrictions , any exact time - dependent calculation for the bh model involves small number of particles .",
    "this limitation has not prevented small calculation predictions to be proven in real experiments with much larger number of particles @xcite and no disorder .",
    "the disorder potential we consider is white noise of strength @xmath9 which means that for a large system the average energy gap between neighboring sites ( the ones coupled by the hamiltonian ) is of order @xmath79 . in other words , for a large system , lattice sites distorted by @xmath80 are very far on average .",
    "thus , most energy levels which appear close to the ground state can not be coupled to it to low orders indicating that our small system calculations can be extrapolated to larger system sizes .",
    "we have shown that the adiabatic ramping of a constant force rapidly oscillating in time allows for the complete scan of the parametric dependence of the ground state of a _ disordered _ bh model . as shown previously @xcite ,",
    "the inclusion of an ac field in the bose - hubbard hamiltonian is equivalent to a renormalization of the effective tunneling for the time independent spatial hamiltonian . a succession of oscillatory fields where",
    "the amplitude is slowly increased gives rise in the adiabatic limit to a succession of effective hamiltonians from some initial @xmath6 to the final @xmath81 and thus allows for a complete scan of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath66 with @xmath11 constant .",
    "we have found that in spite of the increasing complexity of the quasienergy diagram with disorder , adiabatic following of the ground state is feasible with a similar time scale as in a system without disorder .",
    "adiabatic following of the ground state enables the transition from states with long - range coherence into localized states both for commensurate and non - commensurate fillings of the lattice potential . for strong disorder",
    "we have shown that the transition between insulating states localized in the most distorted regions of the lattice is possible .",
    "we have found that the addition of disorder shortens the time scale needed for adiabatic ramping if the disorder is weak or strong compared to the interaction strength . when the disorder is comparable to the interaction strength , adiabatic behavior is still feasible .",
    "our results indicate that this type of transitions between different regions of the phase diagram can be realized adiabatically for experimentally feasible time scales in systems with large number of particles .",
    "the adiabatic ramping of a fast oscillatory force could be used not only to control localization of disordered bosons but also to scan richer phase diagrams predicted for bosonic or fermionic systems in optical lattices .",
