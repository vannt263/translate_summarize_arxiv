    "topological insulators(tis ) @xcite are new states of quantum matter with profound physical features that have their origin in topology .",
    "they have a bulk insulating gap but are distinct from ordinary insulators at stable gapless edge states .",
    "the quantum hall system@xcite , which is an insulator without any kind of spontaneous symmetry breaking , is the first example of topological insulators .",
    "it is believed that there only exists topological trivial phase in 1d systems due to the lack of symmetries .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the 1d quasiperiodic system @xcite shares the same topological non - trivial phase emerged in the 2d integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "indeed , the edge state that characterizes topological property in this system has been observed @xcite .",
    "most recently , topologically protected edge state has been demonstrated in the 1d commensurate off - diagonal aubry - andr@xmath0-harper ( aah ) model @xcite , interpreted by the @xmath1 topological index of the kitaev model @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the topology properties have been studied in optical lattices extensively @xcite , and the edge states have been observed in the photonic system @xcite .",
    "state steering is an important task in quantum control .",
    "many protocols @xcite have been proposed for this purpose , including the optimal control technique , adiabatic control , the technique of stimulated raman scattering involving adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , and open loop controls based on lyapunov functions . among them",
    ", the lyapunov based control has its own advantages due to the effectiveness designing for control fields .",
    "to apply the lyapunov control , a function called lyapunov function has to be specified first",
    ". then the control fields can be designed by guaranteeing the decrease of lyapunov function , and the system would evolve to the target state asymptotically .",
    "in particular , this control scheme has been studied by several researchers @xcite and has been applied to diverse fields in physics .    in this paper",
    ", we steer an arbitrary given initial state into the edge states in a 1d optical lattice by only shaking the on - site energy of the boundaries , which can be established via the lyapunov control . by choosing different lyapunov functions , we show distinct convergence behaviors for the system .",
    "in addition , we also explore a feasible way to realize boundary - boundary entangled states @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a general formalism for the lyapunov control . in sec .",
    "iii , we first apply the general method to steer the system into edge state by shaking only the energy of boundary sites , and study the dynamical behaviors with different lyapunov functions . then we show how to optimize the lyapunov function in terms of fidelity and control time .",
    "an exploration on the effect of errors on the fidelity of final state is given in sec .",
    "iv . by use of the elaborate designing control fields , we study the behavior of boundary - boundary entangled states in sec .",
    "v. finally , we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "although the problem of quantum control might be formulated in different ways , the final purpose is mostly to steer a quantum system from an ( arbitrary ) initial state to a target state by control fields .",
    "we start with the dynamics of a quantum system governed by schrdinger equation ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the system hamiltonian and control hamiltonian , respectively . @xmath5",
    "represent the control fields . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the design of the control fields can be different from proposal to proposal . here",
    ", we use the lyapunov control technique to design the control fields .",
    "the essence of the lyapunov control is to choose a lyapunov function , which is required to be positive and reaches its minimum when the system arrives at target state .",
    "obviously , the following form of lyapunov function @xmath6 meets the requirement . here",
    "@xmath7 denotes the target state which is conventionally an eigenstate of system hamiltonian .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath8 yields @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] stands for the imaginary part of @xmath11 $ ] and @xmath12 is the angle between states @xmath13 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath14 can be satisfied naturally if we choose the control fields @xmath15 $ ] with @xmath16 .",
    "especially , @xmath17 can be used to adjust the amplitude of control fields and the control time .    as the lyapunov function is not unique ,",
    "it can be constructed differently even though the control problem is same .",
    "for example , we may define another lyapunov function by @xmath18 where the operator @xmath19 is hermitian and time independent .",
    "additionally , @xmath19 is also assumed to be positive semidefinite operator acting on the hilbert space spanned by the eigenvectors of the system hamiltonian @xmath20 . with this definition ,",
    "the time derivative of @xmath21 becomes @xmath22|\\psi(t)\\rangle+\\sum_{k}f_k(t)\\langle           \\psi(t)|i[h_k , p]|\\psi(t)\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the lyapunov control requires that the operator @xmath19 should be constructed properly to guarantee @xcite @xmath23=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore a straightforward way to construct the operator @xmath19 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are the eigenstates of system hamiltonian with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the target state .",
    "of course , the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) can be chosen arbitrarily except for the necessary condition @xmath32@xcite .",
    "clearly , if we select the control fields @xmath33|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ ] with @xmath34 , the condition @xmath35 is satisfied naturally .",
    "discussions on the lyapunov function are in order . the lyapunov function given in equation ( [ 4 ] ) with equation ( [ lya2 ] ) is quite general for unitary systems . in fact , the lyapunov function @xmath21 covers the lyapunov function @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the optimalization over the lyapunov function reduces to searching a set of @xmath36 that maximizes the fidelity of final state or minimizes the control time , etc .",
    ", depending on the optimal function . we will carry out this optimalization latter .    according to the lyapunov control theory",
    ", the lyapunov function @xmath37 will converge to its minimum while the state of system converges to a lasalle s invariant set given by @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "when the dimension of lasalle s invariant space is more than one , it becomes complicate to control a quantum system from an arbitrary initial state to a given target state .",
    "nonetheless , by elaborately designing the lyapunov function , we can still steer a quantum system to evolve into a desired state .",
    "the system of interest is the fermi gas loaded in a 1d optical lattice , where the system hamiltonian reads @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the total number of optical lattice sites .",
    "@xmath42 is the hopping amplitude between the @xmath43-th and @xmath44-th site and set to be the unit of energy throughout this paper . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the fermionic annihilation and creation operators for the @xmath43-th site , respectively .",
    "@xmath47 denotes the strength of commensurate potential with an rational number @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath48 is an irrational number , @xmath47 represents the strength of incommensurate potential which is the well - known aubry - andr@xmath0 model @xcite , namely , all eigenstates are extended ( localized ) for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) with a single excitation .    under open boundary condition with proper parameters ,",
    "there exist edge states @xmath51 locating near boundary sites , which stems from the non - trivial properties of the system and can be envisioned by mapping to the 2d quantum hall effects in the hofstadter problem @xcite .",
    "especially , in the single excitation subspace , eigenstates localized near boundaries can be found by resolving the eigenvalue equation , @xmath52 where the @xmath43-th single particle eigenstate is given by @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 are the superposition coefficients and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath55 .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] demonstrates the probability distribution of two edge states .",
    "remarkably , the amplitude of edge states mainly locate at the boundary sites .    .",
    "( b ) the probability amplitude of each site in edge state @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 ( @xmath56 ) denotes the edge state that the amplitude dominantly occupies at site @xmath58 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we study in the single excitation subspace and other parameters are chosen as @xmath41=29 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . ]",
    "next we explore how to use lyapunov control to steer this system into one of two edge states .",
    "note that one of the key points in the control process is how to choose a proper control hamiltonian .",
    "if the structure of control hamiltonian is much complex , even though it can be used to achieve edge states in theory , it may be difficult to manipulate in experiments .",
    "on the contrary , it may not steer the system into edge states when the control hamiltonian is too simple . after combining with the feature of edge states ,",
    "we find it is sufficient to prepare edge states by modulating the on - site energy of boundaries , which can be implemented easily .",
    "the control hamiltonian then can be written as @xmath62 and the lyapunov function can be chosen as @xmath63 which results in the control fields @xmath15.$ ] to be specific , we consider @xmath64 in numerical calculations , and our goal is to steer an arbitrary given initial state to one of the edge states , for instance , @xmath65",
    ".    one can find from equation ( [ 2 ] ) or ( [ 4 ] ) that the lyapunov functions are time dependent via @xmath13 , which implies that the control fields would depend on the initial state at the beginning .",
    "so , to design the control fields , we have to know the initial state @xmath66 , though it might be arbitrary . as the single particle states ( i.e. , the single excitation occupies only at site @xmath67 , denoted by @xmath68 ) are more easily to prepare",
    ", we consider these states as initial states in the following .",
    "note that this method can also be applied for arbitrary superposition of the single particle states .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the time evolution of the fidelity defined by @xmath69 and the control fields @xmath5 while the initial state of system is chosen as @xmath70 .",
    "we find that the control fields @xmath5 can steer the initial state to the edge state eventually .",
    "in addition to this , it can also be observed that the control field @xmath71 plays an important role in the evolution , since the control field @xmath72 is comparatively small .",
    "the physics behinds this result can be understood as follow .",
    "the excitation mainly occupies at site @xmath41 for the target state @xmath56 , thus the control hamiltonian @xmath73 dominates during the time evolution . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding control field plays an important role .",
    "next , we investigate the fidelity @xmath75 ( denotes the fidelity between the final state @xmath76 and the target state @xmath56 ) at different initial states @xmath77 , which are illustrated in figure [ fig:3 ] . there is an intuitive hypothesis from figure [ fig:3 ] that the fidelity @xmath75 might be related to the fidelity @xmath78 ( denotes the fidelity between the initial state @xmath66 and the edge state @xmath57 ) .",
    "in order to confirm it , figure [ fig:4](a ) demonstrates the relation between the fidelity @xmath75 and the fidelity @xmath78 .",
    "we can see in figure [ fig:4](a ) that steering the system to the target state becomes much difficult with the increasing of @xmath78 , since the edge state @xmath57 is also an element of the lasalle s invariant set ( we will demonstrate it in the following ) . therefore , small value of @xmath78 benefits the control process when we set the edge state @xmath56 as the target state .",
    "this observation also holds true when the initial state is an arbitrary superposition of the single particle states , which is not shown in figure [ fig:4](a ) .",
    "those results can be explained as follow . as the initial state can be rewritten as a superposition of the eigenstates of the system hamiltonian @xmath20 ,",
    "i.e. , latexmath:[\\ ] ] those estimations give the order of magnitude in @xmath153 : @xmath154 therefore the differential equation of @xmath155 can be approximated as @xmath156 leading to latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{15 }"
