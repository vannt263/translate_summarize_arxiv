    "this phenomenon is called the gradient catastrophe .",

    "recently some progress in the study the non - isentropic gas dynamics equation has been made .",
    "namely , based on the lagrangian form of the full euler equations in @xcite the authors reduced non - isentropic gas dynamics equations to a special form that allows to study the system by analogy with the riemann invariants under additional assumptions .",
    "the method gives a possibility to find conditions for the singularity formation and to present several new examples of shock - free solutions , which demonstrate a large variety of behaviors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the complete picture of the finite time shock formation from smooth initial data was not achieved .",
    "the result of this paper is obtained by a very classical method .",

    "this system was introduced in @xcite and was used there to prove a local smooth solvability of the cauchy problem .",

    "system , also can be reduced to one equation and the solution is bounded if and only if @xmath165 .",
    "otherwise , the derivatives go to infinity .",
    "moreover , in all that cases and imply that @xmath168 for large @xmath169 with a positive constant @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "this means that @xmath169 ( and @xmath172 as well ) goes to infinity within a finite time and the solution has a gradient catastrophe .",
    "analysis of conditions , , , shows that one can find initial density and pressure such that the solution keeps global smoothness for any initial velocity .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175",
    ". the data corresponds to the case , with @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "such situation is not possible in the isentropic case .",
    "further we note that the extrema of pressure plays very important role . indeed , in these points @xmath178 and",
    "if the derivative of velocity is negative , the points generate singularities of solution .",
    "comparison with conditions shows that for isentropic case this property also takes place .",
    "since @xmath179 , then @xmath180 thus , implies that if the entropy monotonically decrease and pressure monotonically increase ( or vice versa ) , and @xmath181 , then the respective solution is globally smooth .",
    "let us notice that the monotonic profile of entropy was used in @xcite to construct smooth solutions to the compressible euler equations .",
    "the proof does not require the restrictement @xmath7 .",
    "in the isothermal case @xmath182 the only difference will be in the first integral , it should be replaced by @xmath183 with @xmath184 the conclusion on theorem [ mt ] holds as well .",
    "the result can be easily modified for any @xmath185 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath186 ( the chaplygin gas ) , where the initial system is weakly nonlinear , , imply @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 . for the isentropic case ( @xmath190 ) the function @xmath172 goes to @xmath191 within a finite time if @xmath192 for a certain @xmath193 .",
    "this means that the strict hyperbolicity fails on the respective solution .",
    "the singularity that arises in this case comprises a delta - like singularity in the component of density @xcite .",
    "in particular , our results imply that the sufficient conditions of singularity formation from smooth initial data found in @xcite are far to be exact . condition corresponds to hypothesis ii from @xcite .",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to extend the method to the case of several space variables .",
    "the answer is positive for the hyperbolic system of the form @xmath194 where the matrices @xmath195 have a joint set of left eigenvectors . in the framework of gas dynamics",
    "this will be only in the case @xmath196 .",
    "the resulting system contains the multidimensional non - viscous burgers equation .",
    "the criterium for the singularity formation in the smooth solution to the cauchy problem is known for this vectorial equation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore here the method does not give us anything new ."
