    "we present here a study of steady periodic traveling water waves that propagate at the free surface of a two - dimensional inviscid and incompressible fluid of finite depth allowing for stagnation points and for a discontinuous distribution of vorticity .",
    "more precisely , we consider water waves interacting with two vertically superposed currents of different constant vorticities",
    ".    confined first to the investigation of waves of small amplitude , which can be satisfactorily approximated by sinusoidal curves within the linear theory , the examination of periodic traveling water waves arising as the free surface of an irrotational flow with a flat bed originates at the beginning of the @xmath0 century .",
    "the description of waves that are flatter near the trough and have steeper elevations near the crest necessitates a nonlinear approach , which was in fact conducted in the last decades and led to the first rigorous results concerning the existence of wave trains in irrotational flow , see for instance the case of stokes waves @xcite and the flow beneath them ( particle trajectories , behavior of the pressure ) cf .",
    "@xcite .    to go beyond irrotational flows and to treat wave current interactions one needs to incorporate vorticity into the problem , cf .",
    "however , the difficulties generated by the presence of the vorticity have prevented a rigorous mathematical development , which appeared only relatively recently in @xcite , where the existence of small and large amplitude steady periodic gravity water waves with a general ( continuous ) vorticity distribution was proved .    of high significance is the investigation of steady periodic rotational waves interacting with currents that possess a rough  that is discontinuous or unbounded ",
    "discontinuous vorticities model sudden changes in the underlying current , numerical simulations of such flows being quite recent @xcite .",
    "unbounded vorticities on the other hand can describe turbulent flows in channels ( see the empirical law in on page 106 of @xcite ) and are relevant also in the setting of wind generated waves that possess a thin layer of high vorticity adjacent to the wave surface @xcite .",
    "the discontinuous vorticity distribution was considered in the groundbreaking paper @xcite where the existence of steady two - dimensional periodic gravity water waves of small and large amplitude on water flows with an arbitrary bounded ( but discontinuous ) vorticity was proved .",
    "small amplitude capillary - gravity waves with discontinuous but bounded vorticity were constructed in @xcite .",
    "waves with unbounded vorticity were first shown to exist in @xcite but only when allowing for surface tension as a restoring force .",
    "this situation appears in many physical settings one of which being that of wind blowing over a still fluid surface and giving rise to two - dimensional small amplitude wave trains driven by capillarity @xcite which grow larger and turn into capillary - gravity waves .",
    "another striking occurrence in water flows is the presence of stagnation points , that is points where the steady velocity field vanishes , thus making the analysis more intricate , since the usual dubreil - jacotin transform which converts the original free boundary problem into a problem in a fixed domain , is no longer available .",
    "there is a short list of papers dealing with existence of water flows allowing for stagnation points and for a non - vanishing continuous vorticity , cf .",
    "@xcite for gravity waves and @xcite for waves with capillarity . under consideration in this paper is a a more involved setting where , in addition to permitting stagnation points ( whose existence in the fluid is proven ) , we also allow for a discontinuous distribution of the vorticity . to our best knowledge",
    "the incorporation of both stagnation points and of a discontinuous vorticity is a feature that was not rigorously analyzed before .",
    "the governing equations are the euler equations of motion , together with boundary conditions on the free surface and on the flat bed of the water flow .",
    "the discontinuous vorticity that we consider here is of the following type : we assume that the flow has a layer of constant vorticity @xmath1 adjacent to the free surface above another layer of constant vorticity @xmath2 neighboring the flat bed .",
    "of course , the interesting situation ( that we pursue here ) is when @xmath3 .",
    "the unknowns are here the free surface , the interface separating the regions of different vorticities ( which can be seen as an internal wave due to the discontinuity in vorticity ) , the velocity field and the pressure function . in a first step",
    "we reduce the number of unknowns by means of the stream function whose utilization converts the problem into a transmission problem along the line of discontinuity of vorticity with fewer unknowns . the second step that we undertake is to consider a flattening transformation which has the advantage that changes the free boundary value problem into a problem in a fixed domain , thus making it more tractable for the analysis . for studying",
    "the latter resulted problem we employ the crandall - rabinowitz theorem on bifurcation from simple eigenvalues .",
    "the dispersion relation that we obtain  which is a formula giving the speed at the free surface of the bifurcation inducing laminar flows in terms of the two vorticities @xmath4 , the thickness of the two rotational layers and the wavelength  generalizes the one in @xcite obtained in the case of a water flow with constant vorticity and allowing for stagnation points .",
    "the intricacy of the dispersion relation ",
    "a third order algebraic equation  allows us to prove existence of water waves of small wavelength arising as the free surface of water flows with rotational layers of different constant vorticities and containing stagnation points , cf . theorems",
    "[ mt1]-[mt3 ] , [ mt4 ] , [ mt5 ] .",
    "we present also the streamline pattern in the moving frame for the solutions , cf .",
    "figures [ fig1]-[fig3 ] .",
    "our results show especially that the ratio of the amplitudes of the surface wave and that of the internal wave  and the fact that the surface wave and the internal wave are in phase or anti phase  is highly influenced by the vorticities of the currents and by the speed at the free surface of the bifurcation inducing laminar flows .",
    "we briefly outline the content of the paper .",
    "we present in section [ sec2 ] the governing equations together with the analytic setting we work in .",
    "moreover , we also find the dispersion relation whose analysis is undertaken in section [ sec:3 ] for the case @xmath5 , while the more singular case @xmath6 is treated in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the appendix contains several technical lemmas .",
    "under consideration is a two - dimensional steady periodic flow , moving under the influence of gravity , such that the surface waves propagate in the positive @xmath7-direction .",
    "the water flow occupies the domain @xmath8 bounded below by the flat bed @xmath9 with @xmath10 , and above by the free surface @xmath11 , which is a small perturbation of the flat free surface @xmath12 . in a reference frame",
    "moving with the wave speed @xmath13 , the equations of motion in @xmath8 are euler s equations    [ vf ] @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the velocity field , @xmath16 stands for pressure and @xmath17 is the gravity constant .",
    "the equations of motion are supplemented by the boundary conditions , which , ignoring surface tension effects , are @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the constant atmospheric pressure .",
    "we are interested in solutions of the problem for which the vorticity @xmath20 of the flow presents discontinuities of the following type : we assume that , adjacent to the free surface , the water flow possesses a layer @xmath21 of constant vorticity @xmath22 , situated above another layer @xmath23 which is adjacent to the flat bed and is of constant vorticity @xmath24 , that is @xmath25    we steadily assume that @xmath3 and that @xmath26 , @xmath27 we note that , additionally to @xmath28 we have a further unknown : the function @xmath29 whose graph separates the two currents of different vorticities . by helmholtz s law ,",
    "the vorticity is constant along streamlines of the steady flow , and as a consequence of this @xmath30 has to be a streamline of the flow .",
    "this streamline can be viewed as an internal wave due to the jump in vorticity .    with the help of the stream function @xmath31 , introduced ( up to an additive constant ) via the relation @xmath32 we can reformulate - as the free - boundary problem    [ pb2 ] @xmath33 subjected to the conditions @xmath34           \\vert\\nabla \\psi_2\\vert^2 + 2g(d+h)= q & \\text{on $ y = h(x),$ } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    where the constant @xmath35 represents the relative mass flux and @xmath36 is related with the hydraulic head .",

    "the subscript _ per _ stands for functions that are periodic in the horizontal variable , meaning that all the functions considered above are @xmath44periodic with respect to @xmath45 with @xmath46 being fixed .",
    "we first determine laminar flow solutions of problem , that is water flows with a flat free surface and parallel streamlines , meaning that they present no @xmath7-dependence . of interest",
    "are laminar flows that contain stagnation points , more precisely laminar flows that contain streamlines consisting entirely of stagnation points .",
