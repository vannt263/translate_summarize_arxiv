    "to what extent can dynamical control of open quantum systems enhance the ability to extract work or cooling from available thermodynamic resources ? if it can , then we may be able to pursue new or improved quantum - thermodynamic functionalities by harnessing such control to our advantage . here",
    "we review our past and present research that has been dedicated to the elucidation of this issue . in",
    "what follows , we briefly summarize the principles of thermodynamics , discuss their applicability in the quantum domain , then revisit some of its tenets that may be challenged for quantum systems under dynamical control .",
    "the theoretical framework of thermodynamics rests on its four basic laws  @xcite .",
    "the _ zeroth law _ allows the definition of temperature and the _ first law _ is that of energy conservation .",
    "some processes may be allowed by the first law , but are forbidden by the _",
    "second law _ of thermodynamics .",
    "a prime example is the flow of heat between cold and hot bodies .",
    "while the first law does not set any preferred direction to the flow , the second law requires heat to flow from the hot to the cold body .",
    "the _ third law _ forbids any cooling process to attain the absolute zero .    despite efforts to reconcile quantum mechanics and thermodynamics over the years ,",
    "their compatibility is still an open fundamental problem , with crucial bearing on the validity of these thermodynamic laws and the performance bounds of heat machines in the quantum domain  @xcite . a priori ,",
    "it is unclear why these two disciplines should be related : while thermodynamics was developed as a theory that limits possible macroscopic processes , quantum mechanics describes mainly microscopic systems .",
    "nevertheless , thermodynamic principles have played an essential rle in the development of quantum mechanics .",
    "planck proposed the existence of quanta  @xcite by employing a thermodynamic approach to explain the blackbody radiation spectrum . based on thermodynamic arguments",
    ", einstein predicted stimulated emission  @xcite . in the same way",
    ", a thermodynamic approach may yet provide new insights into the ability to exploit quantum processes in machines designed for the performance of work or cooling .",
    "notwithstanding the long - standing rapport of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics , the basic question remains open : what limits does thermodynamics set to the performance of quantum - mechanical devices , particularly , quantum heat machines ?",
    "this fundamental issue has been feeding for years the lively interest in quantum thermodynamics that has culminated in a multitude of quantum heat machine models  @xcite .",
    "many of these models have reproduced the classic thermodynamic bounds , such as the carnot efficiency limit . on the other hand , there has been a growing number of claims that those bounds can be violated at the quantum level  @xcite .",
    "these claims call for a clarification of the general principles of quantum heat machines , beyond specific realizations , and for the development of tools that would safeguard us against inconsistencies with the laws of thermodynamics .",
    "these motivations underlie the present study of simple dynamically - controlled quantum heat machines , their efficiency and power bounds .",
    "the theoretical study of the quantum - thermodynamic models mentioned above has not yet been followed by experimental demonstrations .",
    "the models for quantum thermodynamic machines that have emerged from our research presented here  @xcite also await experimental verification .",
    "such verification would not only advance the state of the art of thermodynamics but would also benefit the ongoing effort aimed at device miniaturization towards the nanoscale  @xcite . as the device size approaches the nanoscale , we are necessarily confronted with quantum thermodynamic issues  @xcite .",
    "this prompts the need for studying quantum heat machines and formulating their thermodynamic performance limits and design principles that are acutely needed for any application where cooling rate , power and size constraints are very severe .",
    "particularly , the miniaturization of refrigerators becomes important , in view of the growing density of transistors on microchips that increases heat production .",
    "these developments require smaller and more efficient coolers and power sources  @xcite .",
    "the considerations outlined above underscore the need to resolve the following issues : ( i ) is the carnot bound on efficiency upheld in quantum heat machines ? ( ii ) are the design principles of quantum heat machines as regards work or cooling power different from those of their classical counterparts , especially when their operation is non - adiabatic ( and hence far from the carnot limit cycle ) ? here",
    "we show that for the simple but generic models we analyze , the answer to the first question is affirmative ( secs .",
    "[ sec_periodically - modulated ] and  [ sec_nlevels ] ) , but quantum - state preparation of the `` piston '' in the heat machine may temporarily cause it to outperform the standard carnot bound , since the quantum state is an extra thermodynamic resource  @xcite ( secs .",
    "[ sec_quantum_piston ] and  [ sec_refrigerator ] ) .",
    "the answer to the second question is also affirmative ( secs .",
    "[ sec_periodically - modulated ] and  [ sec_nlevels ] ) : the highly non - adiabatic operation of such quantum heat machines  @xcite may yield much higher power than their non - adiabatic classical - like counterparts  @xcite .      at the macroscopic level ,",
    "thermodynamic laws govern the exchange of work and heat , bounding the efficiency of heat engines and refrigerators  @xcite . in standard models of such machines , work extraction or cooling",
    "are based on a `` working fluid '' ( system @xmath0 ) that is weakly coupled to two infinite , markovian , heat baths , satisfying system - bath separability .",
    "the two heat baths are at equilibrium at different temperatures .",
    "the system is driven in a cyclic way by a piston ( @xmath1 ) that modulates the system energy while giving or extracting work .",
    "these workhorse models of heat machines are used to test their compatibility with the laws of thermodynamics .    a microscopic quantum description of a heat engine or refrigerator  @xcite requires the formulation of thermodynamic laws within a dynamical context , wherein the working fluid is a quantum system , driven by an external force ( field ) or by quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) energy measurements or phase shifts of the system , while the system is coupled to reservoirs ( heat baths ) : at this level of description one",

    "yet its validity crucially depends on the markovian approximation ( sec .",
    "[ sec_nonmarkovian ] ) .",
    "most of the quantum heat machine models that have been recently proposed and studied  @xcite are the quantum counterparts of the classical _ reciprocating - cycle _ engine .",
    "a reciprocating cycle consists of `` strokes '' in which @xmath0 alternates between coupling to the `` hot '' and `` cold '' heat baths and may also be modulated by @xmath1 . typically , it has four strokes , as in the case of the carnot and otto cycles ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_heat_machines]a ) . both",
    "are composed of two adiabatic strokes in which the working medium is isolated from the environment while being driven by the piston , and two heat transfer strokes in which the working medium is alternately coupled to one of the heat baths .",
    "the latter strokes are isotherms for the carnot cycle and isochores for the otto cycle . at the macroscopic level ,",

    "the piston modulates the system and allows for power ( @xmath18 ) extraction or supply.,width=340 ]    yet , in microscopic or nanoscopic devices , especially when they operate quantum mechanically , reciprocating cycles pose a serious problem : _ on - off switching of system - bath interactions and their non - adiabaticity ( finite duration ) may strongly affect energy and entropy exchange _ , which casts doubts on the validity of commonly discussed models that ignore such effects .",
    "shortcuts to adiabaticity have been motivated by these concerns  @xcite . in any case , for nanoscale systems totally embedded in thermal baths , such system - bath decoupling may not be possible  @xcite .    for these reasons , it is expedient to consider _ continuous - cycle _ heat machines  @xcite . in a continuous cycle",
    "there are no strokes , neither coupling nor decoupling to and from the baths .",
    "instead , the working fluid @xmath0 is _ permanently _ coupled to the two heat baths while being modulated by @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_heat_machines]b ) .",
    "these machines describe scenarios that are common at quantum scales .",
    "the analysis of simple continuous - cycle quantum heat machines is the subject of secs .",
    "[ sec_periodically - modulated ] ,  [ sec_nlevels ] , and  [ sec_quantum_cooler ] . to appreciate the merit of continuous - cycle models , it is instructive to consider ( sec .",
    "[ sec_quantum_cooler ] ) a gas mixture of two atomic species , one of which is driven by a laser which plays the rle of the piston @xmath1 .",
    "the driven atoms represent the system @xmath0 .",
    "they interact through collisions with another atomic species ( a `` buffer gas '' ) , which represents one of the baths .",
    "concurrently , the @xmath0 atoms are coupled to the electromagnetic vacuum ( the second bath ) through spontaneous emission .",
    "the impossibility of avoiding spontaneous emission and collisions with the buffer gas makes the coupling to or decoupling from the baths impossible , so that the reciprocating - cycle models are irrelevant in such scenarios , as opposed to continuous - cycle models .",
    "the importance of the reciprocating cycle stems from its ability to set a universal efficiency limit , known as the carnot bound  @xcite , which applies to any work extraction process . just like kelvin s formulation of the second law of thermodynamics",
    ", the carnot bound restricts work extraction in cyclic processes involving a system ( working fluid ) and baths at different temperatures .",
    "the bound is reached only by the ideal , reversible , infinitely - slow carnot cycle whose efficiency is described by the simple formula @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the temperature of the cold ( hot ) heat bath .    in the case of refrigerators and heat pumps ( hp )",
    "the corresponding bounds are set by the coefficient of performance ( cop ) and are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the efficiency bound for a work cycle at _ maximum power _ is usually of greater practical interest than the carnot efficiency , which can only be achieved in the limit of vanishing power . under typical conditions ( such as linear heat transfer )",
    "the efficiency at maximum power obeys the so - called curzon - ahlborn bound  @xcite @xmath23 however , contrary to the carnot bound , it is not universal and may be surpassed by suitable designs that do not contradict any thermodynamic law  @xcite .    although the carnot bound is considered universal in certain models of quantum heat machines  @xcite , it has been repeatedly contested , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_why_study_qhm ]  @xcite , based on the assertion that there may be non - classical thermodynamic resources , e.g. , quantum coherence  @xcite , bath squeezing  @xcite , or negative temperature of the bath  @xcite that may enhance work extraction or cooling power .",
    "but is it indeed possible to use quantum effects to transgress the carnot bound ?",
    "at least in some models of quantum heat machines , a careful thermodynamic analysis , which considers the cycle - initialization costs as well as their non - equilibrium dynamics , has shown that the resulting performance bounds are not higher than carnot  @xcite . yet , the thermodynamic implications of quantum effects , such as coherence / interference , as well as the work or cooling capacity of quantum states , are still not fully understood , so that such potential quantum resources must be further scrutinized .    here",
    "we put forward ( secs .",
    "[ sec_cycles ] ,  [ sec_periodically - modulated ] , and  [ sec_nlevels ] ) a rigorous approach to continuous cycles in quantum heat machines : we study the steady - state dynamics of _ periodically - driven _",
    "open quantum systems that are _ permanently _ coupled to heat baths .",
    "we ask : are the restrictions set by thermodynamics on such continuous cycles of quantum machines the same as for their classical counterparts or for reciprocating - cycle quantum machines ? as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec_periodically - modulated ] , continuous - cycle quantum heat machines require spectrally separated baths and reach their maximal efficiency / cop , the carnot bound , when modulated at a critical frequency ( rate ) yielding zero power .",
    "a major impediment towards finding the ultimate performance limits of quantum heat machines is the unresolved question : if two quantum systems exchange energy , how is it in general divided into work and heat ?",
    "the second law of thermodynamics draws an essential distinction between heat and work : work can be completely transformed into heat in a cyclic process , yet the opposite is not true . while at the classical level there is a standard and well - established definition of work , this is not the case at the quantum level . in recent years",
    "there have been many different proposals for defining the work performed by quantum heat machines  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a consensus has not yet been reached .",
    "in order to answer the questions above , we put forward a fully quantum heat machine model , where the periodic driving is replaced by a quantum piston .",
    "this model differs from the vast majority of quantum heat machine models that have been proposed to date , which do not address this issue  @xcite as they employ classical fields or forces to drive the working fluid and thus may be deemed _",
    "semiclassical_. as a result , their size and energy consumption may well impede overall miniaturization of the device , limiting potential applications and experimental realizations at the nanoscale . in analogy to light - matter interaction  @xcite , where the quantization of light results in new effects , the same may be true for quantum thermal machines .",
    "would the performance bound of a quantum heat machine be the same if the piston is considered to be a quantum device instead of an external classical modulation ?    as discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec_quantum_piston ] and  [ sec_refrigerator ] , the study of fully - quantized heat machines must rely on a physically sound definition of work and take into account the quantum nature of the piston .",
    "consequently , the efficiency of fully quantized heat engines and the coefficient of performance ( cop ) of their refrigerator counterparts are shown to strongly depend on the initial quantum piston state , its subsequent thermalization and entropy production .",
    "these properties of the state , nicknamed _ non - passivity _ by us , are shown to determine the ability of the quantized piston to serve as a thermodynamic resource .",
    "quantum refrigerators may be used to study the third law of thermodynamics in the quantum domain .",
    "the _ dynamical _ formulation of the third law of thermodynamics  @xcite , nernst s _ unattainability principle _ , forbids cooling to attain the absolute zero ( @xmath24 ) in a finite number of steps , or , more generally , _ in finite time_. however , the universality of this principle has been postulated rather than proven .",
    "it is also debatable whether this formulation is always equivalent to nernst s _ heat theorem _",
    ", whereby the _ entropy vanishes _ at @xmath24  @xcite .",

    "the following tenets represent the prevailing views of these problems :    * the thermal equilibrium of a system and a bath can not be changed by mere observation of the system , unless some action is taken ( by a `` demon '' ) pursuant to the observation  @xcite .",
    "if observations are of the qnd kind , so that they affect neither the state of the system nor that of the bath , then any such change may be suspected to be a violation of either the first or the second law , as in the case of  @xcite . *",
    "equivalently , work can not be performed in a closed cycle by a system coupled to a bath solely as a result of observations : the first law implies that observations affect neither the energy nor the heat exchange between the system and the bath  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , kelvin s formulation of the second law precludes the extraction of work in a cycle by a system that is coupled to a single bath .",
    "so does lindblad s formulation of the second law  @xcite . * in a szilard engine , by contrast , work extraction is obtained through specific actions depending on the result of the observation  @xcite .",
    "if information gathered by observations is commuted into work by a `` demon '' , this work must obey the szilard - landauer ( sl ) bound  @xcite",
    ": it must not exceed the cost incurred by the erasure ( resetting ) of the demon s memory .",
    "if one has a @xmath27-level quantum system in a pure state , one can draw @xmath28 work out of the heat bath .",
    "if the system is in a mixed state @xmath2 with entropy @xmath29 , then the amount of work that can be extracted is  @xcite @xmath30 here we follow the convention that _ extractable _ work has a positive sign for an engine .",
    "the function @xmath31 can be viewed as the information content of the state .",
    "this bound is commonly construed to follow from the second law .    yet , our recent research  @xcite [ see also  @xcite ] indicates that the foregoing tenets do not hold if the quantum system , as simple as a qubit , is subject to dynamical control consisting of frequent observations or phase shifts , even if they do not directly affect the system .",
    "the basic requirements for such anomalies are that these acts of control should be shorter than all the relevant time scales and their intervals should be within the memory time of the bath .",
    "namely , the violation of these tenets is intimately connected with the breakdown of both the markovian and the adiabatic approximations . as shown in secs .",
    "[ sec_nonmarkovian ] and  [ sec_work_information ] , frequent unread measurements of a quantum system coupled to a thermal bath may yield work in a closed cycle from the system - bath interaction ( correlation ) energy , unaccounted for by the sl bound . whereas work and information are related by eq .   that draws upon markovian assumptions , their relation is changed by effects of system - bath correlations within non - markovian time intervals .",
    "nevertheless , the basic laws of thermodynamics , in this case the first and second laws , remain intact despite these violations and may be colloquially summarized by a single tenet : _ `` there are no free lunches '' _ ( sec .  [ sec_work_information ] ) .",

    "3 .   these results are extended to multilevel systems with upper - state degeneracy ( sec .",
    "[ sec_nlevels ] ) .",
    "this degeneracy is shown to be a power - boosting resource .",
    "although coherences between degenerate levels may affect this power boost , it is primarily dependent on the ability of the initial state to thermalize .",

    "<S> in this review the debated rapport between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics is addressed in the framework of the theory of periodically - driven / controlled quantum - thermodynamic machines . </S>",
    "<S> the basic model studied here is that of a two - level system ( tls ) , whose energy is periodically modulated while the system is coupled to thermal baths . when the modulation interval is short compared to the bath memory time , the system - bath correlations are affected , thereby causing cooling or heating of the tls , depending on the interval . in steady state , </S>",
    "<S> a periodically - modulated tls coupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine ( qhm ) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator , depending on the modulation rate . </S>",
    "<S> we find their efficiency and power - output bounds and the conditions for attaining these bounds . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of this model to multilevel systems shows that the qhm power output can be boosted by the multilevel degeneracy .    </S>",
    "<S> these results are used to scrutinize basic thermodynamic principles : ( i ) externally - driven / modulated qhms may attain the carnot efficiency bound , but when the driving is done by a quantum device ( `` piston '' ) , the efficiency strongly depends on its initial quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> such dependence has been unknown thus far . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the refrigeration rate effected by qhms does not vanish as the temperature approaches absolute zero for certain quantized baths , e.g. , magnons , thous challenging nernst s unattainability principle . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) system - bath correlations allow more work extraction under periodic control than that expected from the szilard - landauer principle , provided the period is in the non - markovian domain . </S>",
    "<S> thus , dynamically - controlled qhms may benefit from hitherto unexploited thermodynamic resources . </S>"
