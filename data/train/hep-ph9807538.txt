    "jet production in @xmath3-scattering is an interesting field , both to study perturbative qcd and to obtain information about the partonic structure of the photon .",
    "jet production from two photons can be obtained at @xmath1-colliders as a subprocess to the reaction @xmath4 .",
    "the leptons both radiate photons that , in the simplest case , couple to a quark - antiquark pair which produces jets with high @xmath5 in the final state . in the case that both leptons disappear undetected in the beam pipe the photons are quasi - real .",
    "this case has been studied at tristan @xcite and lep @xcite experiments .",
    "the presence of a large scale ( @xmath5 ) allows perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "these have been performed @xcite and the agreement of the predictions with experimental data is good ( see e.g. @xcite ) . recently it has become possible to detect one of the leptons to perform a single - tag experiment @xcite .",
    "the detection of the lepton allows to reconstruct the virtuality ( @xmath2 ) of the radiated photon and it is thus possible to obtain data on jet production for the case of scattering of virtual on real photons .",
    "it is well - known that the real photon can not only couple directly to the charge of the bare quarks but can also fluctuate into a bound state und thus serve as a source of quarks and gluons .",
    "this resolved component is described by a parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the real photon .",
    "thus , the scattering of photons also provides a possibility to study the parton contents of the photon .",
    "the resolved component of the virtual photon deviates from that of the real photon in that it has a @xmath2-dependence . at large @xmath2 the resolved component of the virtual photon",
    "is believed to be negligable . since so far only limited data exist for the structure of the virtual photon @xcite , the modeling of the @xmath2-behaviour of the virtual photon pdf is still rather ambiguous .",
    "mainly two lo parametrizations of the virtual photon pdf exist , namely those of glck , reya and stratmann @xcite , and of schuler and sjstrand @xcite .",
    "cross sections have been calculated for @xmath0-scattering at lo accuracy some time ago @xcite , but lo calculations suffer from rather large scale and scheme dependences .",
    "thus , it is desirable to perform these calculations in nlo , which has been achieved recently @xcite .",
    "( 122,36 ) ( -10,5 ) ( 30,5 ) ( -10,-22 ) ( 30,-22 )    we will consider @xmath1-scattering cross sections with the @xmath0-scattering subprocess @xmath6 the interaction of a virtual with a real photon can happen in four different ways , depending on whether the photon interacts directly or resolved , which is depicted in fig .  1 . the variables @xmath7 in the following",
    "describe the momentum fraction of the photon @xmath8 in the electron and @xmath9 describes the momentum fraction of the parton in the photon @xmath8 .",
    "taking into account both the transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the virtual photon , the cross section @xmath10 for @xmath1-scattering is conveniently written as the convolution @xmath11 \\label{e+e-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pdf s of the real and the virtual photon are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the unpolarized and longitudinally polarized photon contributions , respectively .",
    "the direct photon interactions are included in formula ( [ e+e- ] ) through delta functions .",
    "for the direct virtual photon one has the relation @xmath16 , whereas for the direct real photon the relation is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 refers to the partonic cross section .",
    "the function @xmath19 describes the spectrum of the real photons emitted from the electron according to the weizscker - williams approximation @xcite .    the partonic cross sections in lo consist of two final state particles .",
    "the nlo corrections consist of the virtual and real corrections , which both exhibit characteristic divergencies .",
    "the real corrections for the different subprocesses d , sr , sr@xmath20 and dr have been calculated with the phase - space slicing method and are available in the literature in nlo @xcite .",
    "the sum of real and virtual corrections is finite after factorization of singularities from the initial state .",
    "of special importance here is the @xmath21 splitting term . in the limit of the @xmath22-pair being collinear the logarithm @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the phase - space - slicing parameter and @xmath25 is the partonic cms energy )",
    "can be factorized from the cross section , which is singular for @xmath26 .",
    "this singularity is absorbed into the pdf of the virtual photon with virtuality @xmath2 in such a way that the @xmath27 factorization result of the real photon is obtained in the limit @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the different subprocesses d , sr , sr@xmath20 and dr have been implemented into the computer program jetvip @xcite which allows to calculate jet cross sections in @xmath0-scattering using the snowmass jet algorithm @xcite .      for producing our plots we assume kinematical conditions that will be encountered at lep2 , where the photons are emitted by colliding electrons and positrons , both having the energy of @xmath29 gev .",
    "we choose the configuration , where the virtual photon travels in the positive @xmath30-direction .",
    "we consider only the @xmath27-grs @xcite parametrization of the photon pdf here .",
    "we use the pdf of grs for both , the real and the virtual photon .",
    "we have set the number of flavors to @xmath31 , adding the contributions from photon - gluon fusion by fixed order perturbation theory .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are set equal , with @xmath32 .    in fig .",
    "[ 10 ] a and b the @xmath5 spectra for the virtualities @xmath33 and @xmath34 gev@xmath35 for the cross section @xmath36 are shown , integrated over the interval @xmath37 .",
    "the value @xmath38 gev@xmath35 is chosen as to reproduce the @xmath39 case .",
    "the sr ( lower full ) and sr@xmath20 ( dash - dotted ) curves coincide in fig.[10 ] a , where the real photon is approximated by the integrated weizscker - williams formula and the virtual photon has the value of @xmath40 . the full cross section ( upper full curve ) is dominated by the dr component in the small @xmath5 range for the small @xmath2 value . for @xmath41 gev@xmath35 ,",
    "the dr and d contributions are of the same order around @xmath42 gev , but the dr component falls off quickly for the higher @xmath5 s , leaving the d component as the dominant contribution .",
    "this is expected , since the point - like coupling of the photons is more important for larger @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "since the virtual photon contribution is suppressed for larger @xmath2 the sr@xmath20 contribution falls below the sr curve when going to higher values of @xmath2 . in all curves",
    ", both sr contributions do not play an important role for the full cross section .",
    "of course , all contributions decrease with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we turn to the @xmath43-distribution of the single - jet cross section for fixed @xmath44 gev between @xmath37 for the virtualities @xmath45 and @xmath46 gev@xmath35 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ 11 ] a  d .",
    "the d and dr distributions for the lowest virtuality @xmath40 are almost symmetric , because of the identical energies of the incoming leptons .",
    "the sr curve falls off for negative @xmath43 , whereas the sr@xmath20 component is suppressed for positive @xmath43 .",
    "going to higher @xmath2 values , the d contribution stays more or less symmetric and dominates the full cross section , as we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ 10 ] for the larger @xmath5 values .",
    "the components containing contributions from the resolved virtual photon dr and sr@xmath20 fall of in the region of negative @xmath43 so that they become more and more asymmetric .",
    "this is clear , since we have chosen the virtual photon to be incoming from the positive @xmath30-direction and the resolved virtual photon contribution is decreasing for higher virtualities .",
    "the dr and sr contributions are of the same magnitude in the negative @xmath43 region and the dr component is dominant for the larger @xmath43 values , where the resolved photon is more important .",
    "the same holds for the d and sr@xmath20 distributions in the negative @xmath43 region , only here the d component is far more dominant than the sr@xmath20 component in the whole @xmath43 region ."
