    "the antiferromagnets on the kagom lattice have frustration due to the competition of the antiferromagnetic interactions between neighboring spins .",
    "the antiferromagnets on the triangular lattice also have been well known as the frustration systems .",
    "while the triangular lattice has 6 nearest neighbors and the adjacent triangles on the triangular lattice share one side , or 2 lattice points , in common , the kagom lattice has only 4 nearest neighbors and the adjacent triangles on the kagom lattice share only one lattice point in common .",
    "thus the spins on the kagom lattice suffer smaller restriction from neighboring spins than the spins on the triangular lattice .",
    "the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom lattice exhibits infinite and continuous degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "theoretically the two - dimensional isotropic heisenberg kagom lattice antiferromagnet have no magnetic phase transition at finite temperature .",
    "the thermal or the quantum fluctuation , however , resolves the degeneracy of the ground state @xcite .",
    "this effect induces the coplanar spin arrangement and two nel states have been discussed as candidates for the spin structure at zero temperature .",
    "one is a @xmath13 type and the other is a @xmath14 type of the 120@xmath15 structure .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that the latter is favored slightly @xcite .",
    "when a weak ising - like anisotropy is introduced into the hisenberg kagom lattice antiferromagnet , the system has the magnetic phase transition at finite temperature and has a peculiar spin structure @xcite .",
    "small perturbation , anisotropy or distortion may resolve the degeneracy of frustrated systems and cause the phase transition .",
    "the jarosite family compounds , kcr@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(so@xmath2)@xmath3 and kfe@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(so@xmath2)@xmath3 are examples of the heisenberg kagom lattice antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "we have investigated these powder samples by the measurements of magnetization and the @xmath9h nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to clarify the magnetic transition and the spin fluctuation in the heisenberg kagom lattice antiferromagnet @xcite . the magnetic ions cr@xmath16 and fe@xmath16 have spins 3/2 and 5/2 , respectively .",
    "the ions form the kagom lattice on the @xmath17-plane and interact antiferromagnetically with each other .",
    "the protons observed by nmr locate nearly on the kagom planes .",
    "adjacent kagom planes are separated by nonmagnetic ions , s , o , h and k with the long interaction paths , so that the interplane magnetic interaction is very weak .",
    "the magnetization was measured using a squid magnetometer in the temperature range between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "figures [ mnfig1 ] and [ mnfig2 ] show the susceptibility of fe jarosite and cr jarosite , respectively .",
    "the susceptibility of fe jarosite has the cusp at @xmath20 } } = 65\\,{\\rm k}$ ] , while the susceptibility of cr jarosite increases abruptly below @xmath21 .",
    "the susceptibility for the heisenberg kagom lattice antiferromagnet has been calculated by the high temperature expansion up to the 8th order and the result is extended to the lower temperature by the pad [ 4,4 ] approximants @xcite .",
    "figure [ mnfig3 ] shows the comparison between the experimental and theoretical inverse susceptibility for cr jarosite .",
    "the experimental values deviate clearly from the curie - weiss law below about @xmath22 and fit very well with the calculated curves above @xmath23 .",
    "the values of the exchange interaction for cr jarosite and fe jarosite are derived to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the theoretical susceptibility deviates remarkably from curie - weiss law below about @xmath26 due to the development of short - range spin correlation . for fe",
    "jarosite the value of @xmath26 is about @xmath27 , that is far away from the experimental temperature region . for the other kagom lattice antiferromagnet",
    "srcr@xmath28ga@xmath29o@xmath30 the value is about @xmath31 and is also large @xcite .",
    "the value for cr jarosite is about @xmath22 , that is in the experimental temperature region .",
    "thus cr jarosite is a good example to show the deviation from the curie - weiss law owing to the small @xmath32 and @xmath33 values .",
    "the @xmath9h - nmr spectrum of fe jarosite has a sharp peak in the paramagnetic phase , while the spectrum below @xmath34 becomes to be broader and shows typical pattern for the powder antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "this transition temperature coincides with the susceptibility data and the spectrum indicates the antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rates , @xmath12 , of @xmath9h in fe jarosite is shown in fig .",
    "[ mnfig4 ] .",
    "the rate @xmath12 in the paramagnetic phase slightly increases as temperature approaches to @xmath35}}$ ] .",
    "the rate in the ordered phase decreases sharply as temperature is lowered .",
    "the nmr spectrum for cr jarosite has a sharp peak in the paramagnetic phase , while the half width increases below @xmath21 .",
    "the rate @xmath12 for cr jarosite is almost independent of the temperature in paramagnetic phase , however , it decreases below @xmath21 as temperature is lowered .",
    "the nmr spectrum of fe jarosite indicates that all protons feel same magnitude of internal dipolar field from fe@xmath16 spins .",
    "this suggests that the ordered spin structure is the @xmath10 type of the @xmath36 configuration with positive chirality .",
    "if there existed the magnetic alignment with negative chirality , two kinds of proton sites with different magnitude of the internal field must exist .",
    "the neutron diffraction experiments confirmed this magnetic structure and revealed that the spins direct to or from the center of triangle on the kagom lattice @xcite .",
    "this spin structure is considered to be caused by the single - ion type anisotropy of magnetic ions .",
    "each magnetic ion is surrounded by an octahedron composed of six oxygens , whose principal axis cants about @xmath37 from the @xmath17-axis towards the center of a triangle and the octahedron deforms slightly .",
    "the deformation and the canting of the octahedron must cause the single - ion anisotropy .",
    "the spin system can be expressed as , @xmath38 where the local coordinate @xmath39 for each ion is determined by the relation with each surrounding octahedron , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the case of @xmath42",
    "the spin structure with the minimum energy for the system is the @xmath43 type with the positive chirality and the spins direct to or from the center of the triangle on the kagom lattice .",
    "this means that the system corresponds effectively to the two - dimensional ising antiferromagnet , which has the magnetic phase transition at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the ordering in the plane would induce the three - dimensional ordering due to the infinitesimal interplane interaction .",
    "the relaxation rate in the ordered phase can be analyzed by the two - magnon process of the spin wave in the heisenberg kagom lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "the relaxation rate by the two - magnon process is expressed as @xcite , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the geometrical factor of the dipolar interaction , @xmath46 is the maximum frequency , @xmath47 is the energy gap and @xmath48 is the state density of magnons .",
    "the dispersion relation of magnons in the system of @xmath10 type spin structure has been obtained by harris et al .",
    "we adapt their method for fe jarosite by introducing the anisotropy .",
    "the dispersion curves have the energy gaps due to the anisotropy and the lowest energy gap is given as , @xmath49 applying the long wave approximation for the dispersion relation , the relaxation rate is given as @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we calculated the temperature dependence of @xmath12 and the calculated values are shown in fig .",
    "[ mnfig4 ] by the solid curve .",
    "the agreement between the experimental data and the calculated values is fairly well and we get the value of energy gap to be @xmath53 .",
    "the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are estimated by using eq .",
    "( [ eqed ] ) and ( [ eqdc ] ) as , @xmath56    as is seen in fig",
    ".  [ mnfig2 ] , the susceptibility for cr jarosite increases sharply below @xmath21 .",
    "below this temperature the difference between the susceptibility measured after the zero - field cooling ( zfc ) and that measured after the field cooling ( fc ) was observed .",
    "the same behavior has been reported by a. keren _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "the magnetization curve was measured at 2.0 k to clarify this anomaly and is shown in fig .",
    "[ mnfig5 ] .",
    "there we find a small hysteresis loop , which suggests the existence of weak ferromagnetic moments .",
    "the difference in the susceptibility between zfc and fc comes from the hysteresis loop below @xmath21 . by our neutron diffraction experiment for cr jarosite",
    "the long - range ordering has been observed below @xmath21 .",
    "et al_. have also reported the weak long range antiferromagnetic ordering observed by the neutron experiments @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the transition of cr jarosite at @xmath21 is not a spin glass like but magnetic one .",
    "the weak ferromagnetic moment is considered to be caused by the canting of the @xmath36 arrangement perpendicular to the @xmath17-plane due to the anisotropy . on the other hand , the ferromagnetic moment was not observed for fe jarosite .",
    "these results can be explained by the antiparallel stacking of the net moments on the @xmath17-plane for fe jarosite and parallel stacking of the net moments for cr jarosite .",
    "this is consistent with the result from the neutron experiments that the magnetic unit cell in cr jarosite is equal to the chemical unit cell , while that in fe jarosite is double the chemical unit cell along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "in summary we have investigated the kagom lattice antiferromagnets kfe@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(so@xmath2)@xmath3 and kcr@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(so@xmath2)@xmath3 by means of the magnetization , nmr and neutron experiments .",
    "the susceptibility data of these samples are well fitted with the susceptibility calculated by the high temperature expansion for the two - dimensional heisenberg kagom lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "long range magnetic ordering occurs at 65 k for kfe@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(so@xmath2)@xmath3 .",
    "the spin structure in the ordered phase is the @xmath36 structure with @xmath57 , + 1 chirality and the direction being to or from the center of the triangle .",
    "the order is caused by the single - ion - type anisotropy @xmath58 .",
    "this system corresponds effectively to the two - dimensional ising system , which has the two - dimensional ordering .",
    "the fluctuation in the ordered phase is caused by the spin wave .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation is governed by the two - magnon process . for",
    "kcr@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(so@xmath2)@xmath3 magnetic transition occurs at 4.2 k. the transition is not spin - glass one but the magnetic ordering .",
    "the weak ferromagnetic moments are observed .",
    "this comes from the canted @xmath36 spin structure , and all net moments in the planes are parallel to the @xmath17-axis .",
