    ", the threshold for 3-sat appears to be roughly @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "research on the satisfiability threshold has extended to generalizations of @xmath0-sat such as the schaefer @xcite generalizations : 1-in-@xmath0 sat  @xcite ( only one true literal per clause ) , nae - sat  @xcite ( at least one true and one false literal per clause ) , and xor - sat  @xcite ( each clause is an exclusive - or rather than a disjunction ) , and more generally , to random constraint satisfaction problems .    in a constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) , we can allow variables to take on values from a domain of size larger than 2 , and we have more freedom as to the types of constraints to use .",
    "there have been various models proposed and studied for random constraint satisfaction problems , eg .",
    "@xcite . for such models",
    ", a major goal has typically been to determine whether it has a sharp satisfiability threshold , and if so , to determine its location .",
    "in addition , there has been a large body of experimental studies @xcite to find the approximate location of the satisfiability threshold and to study the difficulty of solving random instances of various csp models .",
    "the primary motivation for a large number of these studies was the discovery by selman , et al  @xcite that random instances of 3-sat with clause density near the conjectured threshold are very difficult to solve .",
    "researchers who develop sat - solvers study such problems to test and improve their solvers and to look for insights into what can make sat instances computationally difficult . when these researchers expanded to csp - solvers , they wanted to find thresholds for other random csp models with the expectation that this should provide a rich source of difficult instances .",
    "most of this research has been on models where the constraint- and domain - sizes are constant .",
    "there have been studies of models where one or both of these parameters grows with @xmath3 ( eg .",
    "as discussed below , such models tend to have a very different nature ; eg . , the thresholds typically occur when the number of constraints is superlinear .",
    "so our focus in this discussion is on the case where these parameters are both constant .",
    "most random csp models for which the satisfiability threshold is known are in p ( eg.2-sat  @xcite , 3-xor - sat@xcite ) , and hence do not provide difficult instances . we know the satisfiability threshold for a few np - complete problems with constant sized domain and constraints , for example 1-in-@xmath0-sat  @xcite , and a mixture of 2-sat and 3-sat when the number of clauses of size 3 is kept small  @xcite , and a model from @xcite",
    ". however , in each of these cases , a random instance whose number of clauses is just below the threshold , is in some sense equivalent to random 2-sat .",
    "this allows us to prove that such problems are a.a.s .",
    "satisfiable by analyzing a polynomial time algorithm that solves them with uniformly positive probability ( w.u.p.p . ) .",
    ", the @xmath12 of its probability is at least some positive constant . ]",
    "furthermore , instances with density slightly above the threshold a.a.s .  have short resolution proofs of unsatisfiability .",
    "( this is straightforward to show for 1-in-@xmath0-sat , and is proven in @xcite for the other two . ) it is straightforward to design polynomial time algorithms that make use of such proofs to a.a.s .",
    "recognize that such instances are unsatisfiable .",
    "thus , while these problems are np - hard , they are easy to solve when their density is near the satisfiability threshold .    in this paper , we introduce a particular np - hard problem and determine its satisfiability threshold .",
    "the problem is different from previous np - hard problems whose thresholds are known in that we do nt know of any algorithm that can solve random instances whose density is near the threshold .",
    "furthermore , we can prove that such instances a.a.s .",
    "have exponential resolution complexity , which implies that resolution based algorithms will a.a.s .",
    "fail on unsatisfiable instances .",
    "( virtually all complete csp - solvers that are commonly used in practice are resolution - based . )",
    "this is the first random constraint satisfaction problem for which : ( 1 ) we have determined a constant @xmath13 such that if the number of constraints is at most @xmath14 then it is a.a.s .",
    "satisfiable and if the number of constraints is at least @xmath15 then it is a.a.s .",

    "succeed on a random instance when the number of clauses is @xmath4 for @xmath16 arbitrarily close to @xmath13 .",
    "in short , we know the location of a satisfiability threshold around which the instances actually appear to be difficult .    our problem is called @xmath17-ue - csp .",
    "we will define @xmath18-ue - csp in the next section .",
    "we use @xmath19 to denote a random instance with @xmath3 variables and @xmath20 constraints . in subsection [ sec:2core ]",
    "we will specify a precise constant @xmath21 our main theorem is :    [ mt ] if @xmath22 then @xmath23 is a.a.s .",

    "unsatisfiable .",
    "in @xcite the first author proves    [ thc ] for every @xmath25 , @xmath26-ue - csp is np - complete .",
    "furthermore , it is np - complete under the restriction that no two constraints share more than one variable .",
    "the latter restriction is relevant here because random instances with a linear number of constraints a.a.s .",
    "have that property .    in section",
    "[ sec : resolution ] we prove    [ t2 ] for any constant @xmath27 , and any @xmath28 , @xmath29 , the resolution complexity of @xmath30 is a.a.s .",
    "@xmath31 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mt ] follows along the lines of that of dubois and mandler  @xcite , who determined the satisfiability threshold for @xmath0-xor - sat . and no details for @xmath32 .",
    "ditzfelbinger et .",
    "al.@xcite provide a full proof for all @xmath28 , using a somewhat different technique . ]",
    "that problem is in p - it can be solved using gaussian elimination .",
    "however , they did not make use of the fact that it is in p in establishing the threshold .",
    "rather , they applied the second moment method to prove that problems with density below the threshold are a.a.s .",
    "the problem @xmath17-ue - csp is somewhat contrived in that it is designed to have the properties of @xmath0-xor - sat that allow the approach of dubois and mandler to work , while at the same time being np - complete .",
    "the analysis is much more complicated than that of @xcite .",
    "in fact , we have to resort to a computer - aided proof which makes use of interval analysis to rigorously determine the global maximum of a particular function .",
    "the discussion above has focused on random csp models in which the constraint size and domain size are both constant .",
    "researchers have studied models where the domain size grows with @xmath3  @xcite or where the constraint size grows with @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "exact thresholds are known for some such models  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is proven that the models of @xcite and @xcite contain many problems that a.a.s .",
    "have exponential tree resolution complexity , and it is noted that the model of @xcite contains problems that a.a.s .  have exponential resolution complexity .",
    "but in all of these models , the satisfiability threshold occurs when the number of clauses is superlinear in @xmath3 , and the structure of a random constraint satisfaction problem with a superlinear number of clauses is very different from one with a linear number of clauses .",
    "thus , these problems are of a very different nature than , say , the random 3-sat problem .    in summary ,",
    "random @xmath17-ue - csp is the first model of random constraint satisfaction problems for which we know the exact satisfiability threshold and which shares the following characteristics with random 3-sat : ( a ) it is np - complete ; ( b ) there are a linear number of constraints at the threshold ; ( c ) random instances near the threshold a.a.s .",
    "have exponential resolution complexity ; ( d ) the domain and constraint sizes are constant .",
    "random 3-xor - sat was close - it met all of these conditions except for ( a ) .",
    "ours is also the first random csp model with a known linear satisfiability threshold for which it is seems that random instances with density near that threshold are difficult to solve .",
    "there is computational evidence that such problems really are difficult . since the appearance of a short preliminary version of this paper  @xcite ,",
    "random instances of @xmath17-ue - csp with densities close to the satisfiability threshold have been chosen as challenging problems in experimental studies @xcite .",
    "in fact , the study of @xcite indicated that the problems become difficult when the density exceeds the threshold for the appearance of a 2-core in the underlying hypergraph ( see section [ sec : uecsp - intro ] ) .",
    "random instances of @xmath17-ue - csp have also been used as test cases for the sat solver competitions of the sat 2004 , 2005 , 2007 , and 2009 conferences  @xcite .",
    "none of the solvers in the competition were able to solve a test instance on 1200 variables whose density was at the satisfiability threshold .",
    "* remark : * a short preliminary version of this paper appeared in a conference proceedings  @xcite .",
    "there is an error in that version ; specifically in the proof of lemma 16 , which corresponds to lemma [ lem : fmax ] in this paper .",
    "we replaced that proof with the much longer computer - aided proof found here .",
    "we define a _ clause _ to be an ordered subset of variables and a _ constraint _ to be a list of tuples of values that we may assign to the variables of the clause .",
    "a _ constraint satisfaction problem _ consists of a set of @xmath3 variables where each variable has a non - empty domain of possible values , a set of @xmath20 clauses , and a constraint applied to each clause .",
    "the goal is to find an assignment to the variables such that the constraint on each clause is satisfied .",
    "one common restriction is that every variable must have the same domain of values ; that will be the case throughout this paper . in keeping with sat notation",
    ", we will denote an instance of a constraint satisfaction problem as a _",
    "formula_. the _ underlying hypergraph _ of a csp is the hypergraph whose vertices are the variables and whose hyperedges are the clauses .",
    "the inspiration for uniquely extendible csps comes from the proof of the satisfiability threshold for 3-xor - sat  @xcite . in xor - sat ,",
    "each clause is an exclusive - or of the literals , rather than a disjunction .",
    "thus each clause can be interpreted as a linear equation mod 2 , which is why it can be solved using gaussian elimination .",
    "as we mentioned above , their proof of the threshold does not rely in any way on the gaussian elimination algorithm .",
    "instead , they reduce the random formula to its _ 2-core _ , the unique maximal subformula where each variable occurs in at least two clauses .",
    "then , the first and second moment methods are used to give coinciding upper and lower bounds on the satisfiability threshold for the 2-core .",
    "standard calculations translate the satisfiability threshold for the 2-core into a satisfiability threshold for 3-xor - sat .",
    "the key property that makes this proof work is that every constraint in xor - sat is _ uniquely extendible _ :    a constraint on @xmath0-variables is _ uniquely extendible _ if for every truth assignment to any @xmath33 of its variables there is exactly one value that can be assigned to the remaining variable so that the constraint will be satisfied .",
    "it is _ at - most - one - extendible _ if there is always at most one such value and _ at - least - one - extendible _ if there is always at least one such value .",
    "it is the property that the constraints of @xmath0-xor - sat are at - least - one - extendible that permits us to consider only the 2-core .",
    "consider the following procedure to find the 2-core :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * core : * while the formula has any variable that occurs in at most one clause , choose an arbitrary such variable and delete it along with any clause that contains it .",

    "now restore the deleted variables in reverse order , i.e.  @xmath36 , each time adding the variable along with the at most one clause that was deleted when the variable was deleted . because the constraint applied to the clause is at - least - one - extendible , there is a value that can be assigned to the variable that does not violate the constraint .",
    "this will result in a satisfying assignment for @xmath34 .",
    "the fact that the constraints are all at - most - one - extendible is crucial to the fact that the first moment bound yields the exact satisfiability threshold for the 2-core of a random @xmath0-xor - sat formula . to be more specific : let @xmath37 denote the number of satisfying assignments .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that if the number of clauses is @xmath4 then @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a continuous monotonically decreasing function ; in fact , this is true for virtually all models of random csp s where the domain size is constant ( of course , @xmath39 depends on the model ) .",
