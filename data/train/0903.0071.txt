    "a beam of particles can be slowed down by reflecting them from a potential wall ( or `` mirror '' ) moving in the same direction .",
    "an early example is the production of an ultracold beam of neutrons colliding with a moving ni - surface @xcite . moving mirrors for cold atom waves",
    "have been also implemented with a time - modulated , blue - detuned evanescent light wave propagating along the surface of a glass prism @xcite .",
    "more recently , beams of helium atoms have been slowed down using a si - crystal on a spinning rotor @xcite .",
    "also , rb atoms have been stopped with a moving magnetic mirror on a conveyor belt @xcite , which provides a promising mechanism to generate a continuous , intense and slow beam of atoms .",
    "there is clearly a great potential for practical applications of such processes and much interest in their fundamental properties and optimization . in most cases",
    "the analysis is made with classical trajectories , but quantum motion effects may become important for ultracold atoms , as shown in a recent study on matter - wave / moving - mirror interaction @xcite .",
    "one more limitation of standard settings so far is that the mirror motion is adapted only to stop a specific initial beam velocity .",
    "we may however consider the much more general case in which the initial velocities are broadly distributed , or that they are unknown .",
    "stopping a beam in these conditions is a much more challenging objective , and the central subject of the present paper .",
    "can we stop a classical particle of unknown velocity with a moving hard wall ?",
    "the answer is yes and the trajectory of the wall is surprisingly simple , as we shall see in sect .",
    ". we shall also explore in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] the extent to which the same methodology can be applied in the quantum case , and provide numerical examples .",
    "let us start by assuming a classical point - particle emitted at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , moving with unknown velocity @xmath3 along @xmath4 .",
    "a heavy hard wall ( compared to the mass of the particle ) moves also with trajectory @xmath5 and initial condition @xmath6 .",
    "if the particle touches the wall at time @xmath7 with velocity @xmath8 and the wall is moving with velocity @xmath9 at @xmath7 , then the final velocity @xmath10 of the particle after the perfect reflection is @xmath11 this can be easily seen in the reference frame in which the mirror is at rest at time @xmath7 . to fulfill the goal that the particle is at rest in the laboratory frame after the collision",
    ", the mirror velocity should be @xmath12 at the time of the collision .",
    "since the trajectory of the particle with velocity @xmath13 is @xmath14 and the trajectory of the mirror is @xmath5 , the time @xmath15 of the collision is given as a solution of @xmath16 .",
    "the condition for stopping the particle is now @xmath17 using @xmath18 we get @xmath19 the trajectory for the mirror we are looking for is found as the solution of this ordinary differential equation with the initial condition @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is in principle arbitrary , although its value will determine the location and time of the particle - mirror collision , which is quite important in a practical implementation with limited space and time . such a moving wall will stop particles starting at the origin and moving with positive velocity independent of their initial velocity , see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . instead of",
    "@xmath23 we will deal with more intuitive parameters : we assume a final time @xmath24 , this may be a maximal time we are ready to consider in our experiment . at this time",
    ", the wall has moved a distance @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , so we get @xmath26 .",
    "another important quantify is @xmath27 , the boundary velocity for no collision until @xmath24 , i.e. , a particle with an initial velocity @xmath28 will not hit the mirror until @xmath24 .",
    "scheme of the stopping of classical particles : a hard wall moving with trajectory @xmath29 ( solid line ) ; examples of two particle trajectories with different initial velocities ( dashed lines ) . ]",
    "scheme of the transformation between initial parameters and final parameters , the wall is indicated by the black box , the dark gray region is for free motion , and the light gray region for motion with collision .",
    "the symbols provide examples connecting final and initial parameters : @xmath30 ( free motion , circles ) ; @xmath31 ( free motion , boxes ) ; @xmath32 ( collision , triangles ) . ]",
    "let us now examine the effect of the mirror with trajectory @xmath33 in more detail , allowing for a more general scenario where the initial position of the particle is not necessarily zero but @xmath34 .",
    "we are interested in the particle s position @xmath35 and velocity @xmath10 at @xmath24 .",
    "it is useful to introduce dimensionless variables to simplify the notation in the following , namely @xmath36 by a straightforward calculation we get for the position and velocity of the particle at time @xmath37 for @xmath38 :    @xmath39    with @xmath40 if @xmath41 the particle keeps its initial velocity , i.e. , it moves too slowly to collide with the moving - wall before @xmath42 , see also fig .",
    "we can also work out the inverse transformation to get the initial position and velocity from the final parameters for @xmath43 : @xmath44 with @xmath45    the function @xmath46 is important as it provides the extent to which the moving mirror fails to stop the particles when they deviate from the ideal conditions @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this function is shown in fig .",

    "let us examine the case @xmath51 ( and @xmath38 ) , i.e. a collision has occured before @xmath52 : the final velocity is negative , @xmath53 ; also @xmath54 and @xmath55 so the absolute value of the final velocity is increasing with increasing @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] suggests to us a possible strategy to select the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath24 and optimize the stopping : assume that the initial parameters @xmath58 and @xmath8 are fixed ( they may correspond to estimates of the least favorable values expected or permitted , such as the farthest distance from the origin allowed by the initial geometry of the launching conditions and a lower bound for the speed ) .",
    "first we choose @xmath25 and @xmath24 such that @xmath59 we have for the final velocity @xmath60 according to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , this means that if we make @xmath25 large enough , increasing also @xmath24 so that @xmath61 remains constant , the final velocity goes to zero , even with imperfect conditions . the condition @xmath62 should be also satisfied for the chosen @xmath25 , so that the particle collides with the wall , but this is not a problem because @xmath63 in the following we shall discuss the more general case in which the initial position and the velocity of the particle are characterized by a probability density @xmath64 .",
