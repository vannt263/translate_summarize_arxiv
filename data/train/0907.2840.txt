    "the electronic properties of the low dimensional interacting electron systems have attracted great interest for many different reasons , the main being that they are simpler to analyze than higher dimensional ones and they could then be used to gain some insight on their higher dimensional counterparts .",

    "they are also interesting on their own since many materials show a quasi - one - dimensional behavior in a certain range of temperatures where higher dimensional couplings can be neglected .",
    "a third motivation to study 1d systems comes from the very exciting cold atom systems which provide a test laboratory for many important theoretical developments already done and also motivates further analysis that could be in principle directly tested in real systems .",
    "+ in particular , and in connection with real materials , quarter - filled systems have received a lot of attention since they are very good candidates to describe the so called organics charge transfer salts like the bechgaard salts ( tmtsf)@xmath1 or ( tmttf)@xmath1 whre x = pf@xmath2 , asf@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the hubbard model is the basic model for understanding the electronic properties of these quasi 1-d organic conductors and in some cases , lattice deformations could play a central role .",

    "several experimental studies have shown clear evidence for the existence of charge order @xcite in organic charge transfer solids and this has stimulated considerable theoretical efforts @xcite .",
    "these materials involve coulomb repulsion , both on - site and between nearest - neighbors ( @xmath3 , @xmath0 respectively ) and are @xmath4-filled . due to the nearest - neighbors coulomb repulsion",
    ", it is expected that in these materials a charge ordering @xmath5 sets in , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to occupied and unoccupied sites .",
    "the charge order @xmath5 corresponds to the so called @xmath8 charge - density - wave ( cdw ) , where @xmath9 with @xmath10 the lattice constant .",
    "however , for large values of @xmath0 , and when electron - phonon interactions are included , the ground state corresponds to an ordering like @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the charge order corresponds to a tetramerized @xmath12 cdw and it coexists with the @xmath12 periodic modulation of the intersite distances , called bond - ordered - wave ( bow ) or a mixed @xmath12 + @xmath8 bow .",

    "we show that the ground state at zero temperature indeed favors several period two and period four distortion patterns , stemming from a competition between elastic and charge - spin energy .",
    "these patterns spontaneously break translational symmetry , with different phases depending on the coulomb interaction strengths @xmath3 and @xmath0 and on the value of the spin - phonon couplings .",
    "a rich phase diagram is obtained , including all the combinations of charge order and @xmath17 deformations as a function of the spin - phonon couplings .",
    "when the effect of the peierls deformation in the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction is not considered , our analysis reproduces previous results obtained with numerical methods@xcite .",
    "the main novelty in our treatment is the inclusion of a nearest neighbors coulomb repulsion @xmath0 which depends on the distance between adjacent ions and hence depends on the lattice distortions .",
    "the phase diagram then changes substantially indicating that this variation on @xmath0 should not be neglected in comparing to experiments .",
    "our analysis allows for a description only at a qualitative level , but it has the advantage of being easily generalizable to include other perturbations as longer range coulomb interactions , to treat arbitrary filling fractions , to add an external magnetic field , etc .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model and its analytical treatment .",
    "the phonon sector is described in the adiabatic approximation by classical static deformations and we analyze the possible patterns . in section iii , we use the bosonization approach to represent the electrons operators in terms of bosons and analyze the effective description by considering all the relevant perturbation terms as semiclassical potentials .",

    "<S> we include the effect of the peierls deformation in the nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath0 , that may be present in real materials where coulomb interactions depend strongly on the distance , and we show that the phase diagram changes substantially for large @xmath0 when this term is taken into account . </S>"
