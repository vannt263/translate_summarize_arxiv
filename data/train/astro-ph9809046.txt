    "it is notoriously difficult to determine distances to dwarf elliptical galaxies ( hereafter des , subsuming `` dwarf spheroidals '' , cf .",
    "ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "their low gas content rules out hi 21cm - line observations , and their low surface brightness makes optical spectroscopy feasible only for the very brightest members of the class .",
    "most of the available redshifts of des are for galaxies in the virgo cluster ( binggeli et al .",
    "1993 ) and the centaurus cluster ( stein et al .",
    "1997 ) , and reflect peculiar velocities rather than individual distances within the cluster . but in clusters there is no real need for individual distances : des are so abundant and strongly clustered ( see , e.g. , binggeli et al .",
    "1987 for virgo , or thompson & gregory 1993 for coma ) that they must lie near the mean distance of the cluster .    in poor groups and the field ,",
    "where the distribution of des is sparse , individual distance information is absolutely indispensable .",
    "( we recall that true `` field '' ( i.e. isolated ) des are apparently very rare : cf .",
    "binggeli et al .  1990 ) . here",
    "the only way to locate a diffuse , dwarf - like system and thus to unveil its physical nature is to estimate its distance .    for nearby de candidates , it is possible to resolve the stellar population and derive the distance from a deep colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd , e.g.  dacosta et al .",
    "1996 , smecker - hane et al .",
    "1996 , stetson 1997 ) , or from the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb , lee et al .",
    "1993 , caldwell et al .",
    "these methods are costly and time consuming . with hst ,",
    "the cmd method is feasible out to @xmath10 4 mpc , and the trgb method out to @xmath10 12 mpc .",
    "alternatively , the surface brightness - magnitude relation of des ( e.g.  binggeli & cameron 1993 , jerjen & binggeli 1997 ) can be used to estimate the distance of a de out to perhaps 50 mpc . however , the uncertainty ( 1@xmath11 ) in the distance modulus for a single galaxy is large , typically @xmath12 0.7 mag , corresponding to a 40% distance error .",
    "young & currie ( 1995 ) claimed that this error can be reduced to @xmath12 0.4 mag ( comparable to the accuracy of the tully - fisher method ) with a similar relation based on the shape of the de luminosity profile , but this claim appears to be incorrect ( binggeli & jerjen 1998 ) .",
    "here we show that the well - known surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method can be used to determine distances to dwarf ellipticals in the intermediate distance range of 110 mpc ( and possibly beyond ) with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the sbf method was introduced by tonry & schneider ( 1988 , hereafter ts88 ) to measure distances to bright elliptical ( e ) galaxies .",
    "the method is based on the discrete sampling of a galaxy image with a ccd detector and the analysis of the resulting pixel - to - pixel variance caused by unresolved stars . for a detailed description of the method the reader",
    "is referred to ts88 and jacoby et al.(1992 ) .",
    "application of the sbf method was subsequently extended to bulges of spiral galaxies ( tonry 1991 , luppino & tonry 1993 ) and to globular clusters ( ajhar & tonry 1993 ) .",
    "a massive sbf observing programme is in progress to improve the cosmic distance scale ( tonry et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the first , and up to now only , application of the method to _ dwarf _ ellipticals is due to bothun et al .  (",
    "1991 ) who observed the fluctuations in very large , nearly flat , low - surface brightness galaxies ( a special type of des ) in the fornax cluster of galaxies .",
    "we show here that the sbf method is particularly well suited for des at a distance of a few mpc  slightly beyond the distance where the galaxies would be resolved into stars .",
    "in this paper we present a pilot sbf analysis for five dwarf ellipticals in the nearby sculptor ( scl ) group , also known as the south polar group .",
    "these galaxies have recently been identified in an extensive survey of the southern scl and centaurusa ( cena ) groups for faint de members ( jerjen et al .",
    "1998a : jbf98a ) .",
    "special care has been taken with the calibration of the fluctuation magnitude @xmath3 , because the stellar population of dwarf ellipticals is quite distinct from that of the brighter ellipticals .",
    "in fact , even among the local dwarf spheroidals there is a wide range of star formation histories .",
    "nevertheless , we find that @xmath3 is sufficiently robust against such variations , at least for stellar systems dominated by old populations , and propose a first estimate of @xmath3 for des",
    ".    we will show that the sbf distances derived for the five des ( between 1.7 and 4.4 mpc ) , unambiguously identify these objects as sculptor group members .",
    "moreover , the dwarfs neatly fall into place with the known substructure of the group .",
    "we demonstrate the great potential of the sbf method applied to des as a tool to map the supergalactic structure in the local volume ( out to the virgo cluster ) . with our enlarged scl sample ,",
    "we re - analyse the 3d distribution of these galaxies and confirm earlier findings ( tully & fisher 1987 , binggeli 1989 ) that the sculptor complex has a prolate structure and is part of a much larger cloud of galaxies which includes the local group ( lg ) .",
    "the sbf results for the de sample from our cena group survey will be published elsewhere ( jerjen et al .",
    "1998b : jfb98b ) .",
    "following ct et al.s  ( 1997 , hereafter c97 ) successful search of the scl group region for faint new dwarf irregular members , we conducted a similar visual search for faint de candidates using the same plate material .",
    "seven very diffuse objects were identified which had de - like morphology and which were thus suspected to be dwarf spheroidal members of the scl group ( for the details of this survey , see jbf98a ) .",

    "ngc 59 is clearly of this type , eso294 - 010 arguably so . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "des ( dwarf spheroidals ) are often hard to distinguish from smooth irregulars of type imv .",
    "in fact , there may be a true evolutionary transition between gas - rich irregulars and gas - poor des ( e.g. ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "dwarfs with a mixed morphology ( appearing too smooth for a plain i m , but too lumpy for a pure de ) were called `` intermediate '' or `` ambiguous '' and classified de / im ( sandage & binggeli 1984 ) .",
    "a well - known local example is the phoenix dwarf system ( van derydt et al .",

    "three of our objects seem to fall in this class and are classified accordingly .",

    "these stars may mark the presence of a small population of young stars .",
    "eso294 - 010 , on the other hand , appears slightly lumpy in the centre ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "subsequent spectroscopy ( in sec.6 ) showed emission lines , so this is a clear example of a mixed type .",
    "but even the smoothest des probably contain small amounts of intermediate - age or young stars ; this we know from the local dwarfs ( cf .",
    "note also that the colours of our objects ( with @xmath20 , cf .",
    "column 10 of table  [ tbl-1 ] ) are rather blue for des , whose @xmath21 values range from 0.5 to 2.3 ( e.g. , evans et al .  1990 ) .",
    "so the morphological deviations from a pure de are simply the manifestation of an underlying variety in the ( unresolved ) stellar populations .",
    "one of the principal results of the present paper is that this variety does not cause difficulties for the application of the sbf method to des , because the fluctuation magnitude @xmath3 turns out to be rather insensitive to variations in the stellar contents within the observational constraints ( sec.5 ) . in the following",
    "we will use the term `` de '' in a loose way , including all of the morphological variants discussed above .",
    "the galaxies were observed in two runs , on september 1115 , 1996 , and august 2830 , 1997 , using the imager at the nasmyth b focus of the 2.3 m anu telescope at siding spring observatory . the detector was a tek 1k@xmath221k thinned ccd with a pixel size of 24@xmath23 m , yielding a scale of 0.6@xmath24 pixel@xmath9 and a 6.7@xmath25 diameter circle field of view .",
    "the ccd gain was 1 e@xmath26/adu and the readout noise was 7 e@xmath26 .",
    "we observed in the kron - cousins @xmath1-band , because our application of the sbf technique differs from previous studies which used @xmath27 or @xmath28 ; we are working on small , low - surface brightness objects so our data are photon - limited by the sky rather than by the galaxy itself .",
    "the sky is significantly fainter in @xmath1 than in @xmath27 relative to the rgb stars which produce the surface brightness fluctuations [ @xmath29=1.5 versus @xmath30=0.8 ] .",
    "another advantage of the @xmath1 filter is to avoid fringing which occur with thinned ccds beyond 7000 .",
    "weather conditions were photometric and the seeing measured between @xmath31 .",
    "for each of our galaxies a series of 4 to 5 exposures were taken each randomly offset by @xmath32 and of 450 to 600 sec duration , giving a total integration time of 1800 to 3000 sec .",
    "flat fields were obtained every night from exposures of the morning and evening sky .",
    "standard stars of graham ( 1982 ) were observed throughout each night for the photometric calibration .",
    "processing of the ccd frames with iraf was carried out in the usual manner .",
    "the overscan region provided the bias level , which was subtracted from the frame .",
    "next , each science frame was flattened with a master twilight - sky flat , constructed from a median of 59 sky flats taken during the same night .",
    "all reduced frames were flat to 0.1% .",
    "the sky was modelled by fitting a plane to selected star - free areas well away from the galaxy .",
    "while sky determinations can be quite difficult for giant ellipticals due to their extended halos and galaxy sizes comparable to the field of view , this is simple in our case .",
    "finally , the sky subtracted images of a galaxy were registered and combined to a master frame in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and to remove artifacts , bad pixels , and cosmic rays . in fig.[fig1 ] we show the processed @xmath1-band images for four of our galaxies . @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath1-band images of eso294 - 010 are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "to prepare the master frames for the sbf analysis we essentially followed the procedure described in ts88 .",
    "first , we employed daophot ( stetson 1987 ) routines to identify point sources which would disturb a 2d - fit of the mean galaxy light distribution . because of the small size of the galaxies and the high galactic latitude , there is only little contamination by foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "globular clusters are also a minor problem here , because globular clusters are rare in faint dwarf galaxies . however , as mentioned in sec.2 , two of our galaxies , classified as de / im , are contaminated with a few bright stars of their own .",
    "these also had to be removed .",
    "all identified point sources were replaced by a nearby patch of galaxy of the same surface brightness .",
    "isophotes were computed for the cleaned galaxy image by fitting ellipses with variable radius , ellipticity , and position angle . these were used to model the mean galaxy surface brightness distribution , which was then subtracted from the original master frame . to normalise the variance amplitude of the stellar fluctuations across the residual image",
    ", we divided the residual image by the square root of the mean galaxy surface brightness distribution .    for each galaxy",
    "the sbf analysis was carried out on two different square subimages ( field 1 and 2 ) with size between 30 to 60 pixels which were selected within the 27.5 @xmath1magarcsec@xmath33 isophote .",
    "the overlap of the fields was kept as small as possible ( @xmath34% ) to get independent distance measurements .",
    "special care was further taken to choose subimages with only few ( @xmath34 ) resolved point sources , galaxies , or other features daophot formerly had identified .",
    "for example , the region of eso294 - 010 ( see sec.6 for more details ) was excised from the analysis .",
    "remaining objects in the subimages were replaced by uncontaminated patches ( i ) randomly selected from the region outside of the subimage area and ( ii ) in the same surface brightness range .",
    "this patching process was employed as alternative to the masking method described in ts88 .",
    "the idea was to replace the few disturbed image parts with patches carrying the fluctuation signal .",
    "as artificial periodicities and poor signal - to - noise data could be introduced in this way it is crucial to take into account criteria ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "the number of pixels corrected never exceeded 5% of the total subimage area .",
    "experiments showed that , at this percentage level , the patching method is uncritical for the signal we intend to measure .    at this stage of the procedure",
    ", we have images whose main sources of variance are the stellar fluctuations and a photon shot noise that is nearly uniform over the image ( the ccd readout noise is negligible ) .",
    "to disentangle the two components we fourier - transformed the cleaned subimages and analysed their power spectra ( ps ) , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . having calculated the ps of the point spread function ( psf ) from well isolated stars on the master frame , the observed ps of the galaxy was modelled as a weighted combination of a psf - convolved component and a constant white - noise component : @xmath35 the free parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( the two weights ) were determined by a least - squares fit of equ.1 to the data .",

    "this galaxy was recently part of a study on the star formation histories of sculptor group dwarf galaxies ( miller 1996 ) .",
    "miller found that eso294 - 010 is a typical early - type dwarf with no evidence for ongoing massive star formation .",
    "no regions were discovered and the total h@xmath6 luminosity is very low . nevertheless , with a sufficiently long integration time we hoped to detect balmer absorption lines in the spectrum which then could be used to measure a redshift .",

    "long - slit spectroscopy was carried out for eso294 - 010 in september 1997 .",
    "we used the double - beam spectrograph ( dbs ) at the nasmyth a focus of the 2.3 m anu telescope to observe a blue and a red spectrum simultaneously .",
    "the detectors were two site 1752@xmath22532 thinned ccds with a pixel size of 15@xmath23 m , and a scale of 0.9@xmath24 pixel@xmath9 across the dispersion .",
    "the wavelength scales were 1.1 pixel@xmath9 in the blue and 0.55 pixel@xmath9 in the red .",
    "beam splitter and grating angles were chosen to cover the wavelength ranges 35005500 and 60007000 , respectively .",
    "the slit was positioned at the galaxy centre and aligned along the major axis .",

    "the agreement of the velocities derived from the individual lines is excellent , with @xmath108 .",
    "we suggest that 5  is a more realistic estimate of the velocity error .",
    "this low velocity is in accord with our low sbf distance for that galaxy , and it will be shown below that it fits nicely into the velocity pattern of other scl group members .",
    "the most important result of our sbf analysis is that all five objects fall in the distance range of previously known scl group members , thus confirming their suspected membership as group dwarfs .",

    "overall , the impression is that the dwarf irregulars are not strongly associated with the main scl group members but are scattered over the entire volume in the form of a `` cloud '' .",
    "this is of course again in accord with the morphology - density relation for dwarf galaxies ( binggeli et al .",
    "the whole scl group seems to have the shape of a cigar of length 3 mpc and thickness 1 mpc , which we see pole - on because the lg lies near its end .",
    "a much better view of this can be gained if the cigar is turned to the side by plotting the distances linearly . for this",
    "we have first to transform velocities to distances via a hubble diagram .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show the hubble diagram for the total of nine galaxies with known distances and velocities , to which we have contributed eso294 - 010 and ngc 59 .",
    "the velocities ( @xmath111 ) are relative to the centre of our galaxy .",
    "the major scl group members show a tight linear relation between velocity and distance .",
    "such a trend was already seen by puche & carignan ( 1988 ) and is now confirmed and amplified by the two new data point from the des ( filled squares )",
    ". a maximum likelihood linear fit to the data yields : @xmath112= 119(\\pm7 ) \\cdot d [ { \\rm mpc}]\\,\\,-136(\\pm14)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is taken to be the independent variable and the distance errors are given in table  [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "the mean scatter of the residuals about the line is remarkably small , with @xmath113mpc ( 0.23mpc without ngc 45 ) and @xmath114(27without ngc 45 ) .",
    "large peculiar velocities due to internal group dynamics are clearly absent .",
    "this strongly suggests that our scl galaxies form a `` cloud '' ( e.g. devaucouleurs 1975 , tully 1982 , tully & fisher 1987 ) , meaning a supergalactic structure of higher - than - average galaxy density which , in contrast to a `` group '' , is gravitationally _",
    "unbound_. however , bound substructures , e.g.  defined by one giant galaxy plus a swarm of dwarf companions , are often found embedded in such a cloud .",
    "this also seems to be the case here .",
    "the slope of the hubble relation of equ.5 is very steep ( 119mpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "a plausible reason for this deviation from the global hubble law ( @xmath115 10 mpc@xmath9 ) is the gravitational influence of the lg .",
    "the deceleration of the local expansion field ( for @xmath116 4 mpc ) by the lg was nicely recovered by sandage ( 1986 , 1987 ) who used his local galaxy data to put constraints on the mass of the lg . however , an attempt to fit one of sandages template curves for the local hubble diagram ( 1986 , his fig .  2 ) to our data ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) proved unsuccessful . at present",
    "we do not understand the dynamics underlying the scl cloud velocity field , and a dynamical analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "because the velocity - distance relation of equ.5 is so tight , we can use it empirically to obtain approximate distances to those scl galaxies which have only velocities , i.e.  the dwarf irregulars of c97 .",
    "based on these distances we show , in fig .  [ fig9 ] , the distribution of _ all _ scl cloud members in projection on to the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) .",
    "this provides us with a side view of the cigar - shaped scl cloud , as it was described above .",
    "the scatter of the third dimension here , the height above / below the sgp , is quite small ( @xmath117mpc ) .",
    "we have also included lg `` members '' and galaxies at the outer fringes of the lg in this plot ( data taken from van den bergh 1994 ) , to demonstrate that the scl cloud and the lg may actually form _ one _ structure .",
    "this conjecture was raised before by binggeli ( 1989 ) .",
    "there is a marked asymmetry in the distribution of galaxies within a distance of 1.5 mpc . aside from the close companions to our galaxy and m31 , most lg dwarf members and suspected members ( ic1316 , wlm , ngc 6822 , phoenix , tucana , sagdig , ddo210 , pegasus , ic5152 , ... ) form a southern extension of the lg  a bridge across to the scl cloud ( see also fig.2 in binggeli 1989 ) .",
    "the whole structure can be described as a prolate ( 6 @xmath22 2 mpc ) cloud of ( unbound ) dwarf irregulars , in which a number of denser groups are embedded , each containing one or more massive galaxies plus a swarm of ( bound ) dwarf companions which tend to be of early type .",
    "certainly our galaxy and m31 with their satellites form such condensations  each alone , and together as the lg . in the scl region",
    "we note again the three subclumps mentioned before : centred on ngc 55 ( plus ngc 300 ? ) , ngc 247/253 , and ngc 45 .",
    "ngc 7793 may define a fourth subclump or may be member of the first ( davidge 1998 ) .",
    "we note again the position of our five early - type dwarfs in this map : they tend to mark the condensations .",
    "the dynamics of these scl subsystems with respect to each other , and with respect to the lg in particular , is not clear at present .",
    "we note that the major scl group members are much less massive than m31 or our galaxy , and that m31 and the galaxy lie at the extreme end of the prolate cloud , but we do not know if this is physically significant . finally , it is worth mentioning that the scl - lg cloud is part of a yet larger structure  a prolate cloud that stretches out to the comai cluster at @xmath10 15 mpc , in the direction of the virgo cluster .",
    "the feature is indeed called the `` coma - sculptor cloud '' ( tully & fisher 1987 , see plate 14 ) .",
    "we have shown that the surface brightness fluctuation method can be successfully used as a distance indicator for low surface brightness dwarf elliptical galaxies as faint as @xmath118 .",
    "the application to the dwarf ellipticals rather than normal ellipticals has two advantages : ( 1 ) there are many des in the lg and its vicinity , and independent distances to these nearby des can be used to calibrate the absolute fluctuation magnitude @xmath3 , ( 2 ) through hst studies , we have detailed information about the variety of stellar content and star formation history of this galaxy type .",
    "however , most of them are dominated by an old metal poor stellar population . in this situation",
    ", first results from stellar population synthesis models suggest that @xmath3 is relatively insensitive to the sfh .",
    "the internal fluctuation error for our des is 0.04 - 0.12mag which includes the results from comparison of two different fields of the same galaxy .",
    "a small systematic uncertainty for @xmath3 comes from the unknown stellar content of the galaxy .",
    "for example , @xmath3 gets 0.12mag fainter when going from a pure old population ( all stars older than 8 gyr ) to an old population contaminated by 10% of young population .",
    "this trend was taken into account here by applying appropriate calibration constants to the different morphological galaxy types .",
    "the overall distance error we derive is between 4 and 7% .",
    "although a more detailed analysis is required to follow up the population issue , a very satisfactory hint at the reliability of the theoretical values comes from the fact that all des turned out to be close companions of scl group members for which independent distance measurements exist .",
    "these parent galaxies cover the full 3mpc depth of the scl group .    based on the results for our five des",
    ", we further reviewed the kinematics and the 3d - distribution of the scl group .",
    "surprisingly , the hubble flow at the group shows no evidence for disturbance due to gravitational interaction between the main group members but is possibly decelerated by the tidal force of the nearby , massive lg leading to a large local hubble constant of @xmath119mpc@xmath9 . taking advantage of the tight empirical velocity - distance relation we determined distances to dwarf irregulars in the scl region and compiled distances from the literature for galaxies in the local volume to illustrate that the lg and scl group are not isolated in space but are part of a large prolate cloud ( 6 @xmath22 2 @xmath22 1 mpc@xmath120 in size ) of dwarf irregulars well defined within the supergalactic plane .",
    "a number of groups are embedded in this structure , each containing one or more massive galaxies accompanied by a population of bound dwarf satellites which tend to be of early type .",
    "finally it is interesting to note that four of our de galaxies were already known prior this study .",
    "it is their membership of the scl group which was uncovered here .",
    "this is a clear signal that the search for nearby dwarf elliptical galaxies should not only be focussed on the discovery of new , very low surface brightness galaxies but also on a careful follow - up of already known galaxies which appear nearby from their morphology . for such follow - up work ,",
    "the sbf method is a powerful tool for measuring the distance of a galaxy . for the future ,",
    "this opens up the possibility to measure accurate distances to all known des in the distance range between 1 and 10mpc without the expensive requirement of resolving the stellar system into stars .",
    "this will allow us to establish background - free de samples , to explore the galaxy content of medium and low - density regions of the nearby universe , and to study the physical properties of des in greater details .",
    "furthermore , the existence ( or non - existence ) of isolated early - type dwarfs can be established as a constraint on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "we are grateful to john tonry and alan dressler for very helpful advice , to the referee who made some important suggestions , and to sylvie beaulieu for doing test observations of ngc 5128 which were used to establish the sbf method on low - surface brightness regions .",

    "<S> the precision of the sbf distances ( 5 to 10% ) contributes to delineating the cigar - like distribution of the scl group members , which extend over distances from 1.7 to 4.4 mpc and are concentrated in three , possibly four subclumps . </S>",
    "<S> the hubble diagram for nine scl galaxies , including two of our des , exhibits a tight linear velocity  distance relation with a steep slope of 119  mpc@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that gravitational interaction among the scl group members plays only a minor role in the dynamics of the group . however , the hubble flow of the entire system appears strongly disturbed by the large masses of our galaxy and m31 leading to the observed shearing motion . from the distances and velocities of 49 galaxies located in the local group and towards the scl group , </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the continuity of the galaxy distribution which strongly supports the view that the two groups form a single supergalactic structure . </S>"
