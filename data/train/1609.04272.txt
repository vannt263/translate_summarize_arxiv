    "understanding the effect of noise is of great interest for creating many of the predicted quantum technologies , e.g. , for quantum metrology , quantum cryptography and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "almost all quantum systems suffer from decoherence in one form or another as it is impossible to isolate a system completely .",
    "moreover interactions are needed to prepare , manipulate or read off the state of a system .",
    "many recent publications have focused on combating different forms of decoherence by designing control schemes which are stable against specific forms of decoherence .",
    "different strategies have been followed to design such schemes , e.g , dynamical decoupling @xcite , composite pulses @xcite ,  shortcuts to adiabaticity \" @xcite , and optimal control schemes @xcite .",
    "there are different possible approaches for modelling this decoherence .",
    "one is based on a system - bath theory , where the bath dynamics are traced out under the born - markov approximation @xcite .",
    "another approach is to assume a `` classical noise '' , whereby the effect of the bath is described by a stochastic temporal evolution of a closed system .",
    "it has been shown for random telegraph noise ( also known as a two - state markov process or dichotomic markov process ) acting on a qubit , that these descriptions lead to equivalent dynamics @xcite .",
    "classical noise can of course also occur from classical fluctuations in the experimental system parameters .",
    "this noise could also be purposefully used to perform quantum simulations of environmentally induced decoherence @xcite . hence understanding the effect of classical noise on a quantum system",
    "can be quite useful .",
    "in this paper we will consider the effect of classical poisson white noise ( sometimes referred to as white shot noise ) @xcite .",
    "it is a sequence of random markovian strikes with exponential inter - arrival times , i.e. , which are poisson distributed in time .",
    "poisson noise is useful for modeling noise processes which occur as a result of a small number of discrete events , e.g. , photons for electromagnetic radiation or electrons for electrical current . for a large number of events",
    ", the poisson distribution tends to a normal or gaussian distribution .",
    "white shot noise has already been widely discussed in the context of classical physics @xcite .",
    "it has been applied to a variety of settings , e.g. , micro - mechanical resonators @xcite , the statistics of current through josephson junctions @xcite , modelling random impulsive excitations @xcite , and its effects on transport of brownian particles @xcite .",
    "it has also been used to model the effect of light intensity fluctuations on photochemical reactions @xcite and radiation pressure shot noise in optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "it was first considered in a quantum setting in @xcite and has since been proposed as a power source for a quantum heat engine @xcite .",
    "it is also a special case of random telegraph noise with vanishing correlation time @xcite .",
    "general random telegraph noise has been used to investigate noise effects on tunneling dynamics @xcite , model the environmental noise of a quantum dot @xcite , and model decoherence of qubits in general @xcite . a master equation for random telegraph noise",
    "has been derived for time independent systems @xcite .",
    "previous works have mainly focussed on gaussian noise for stochastic hamiltonian evolution @xcite .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to have a tractable master equation for a more general non - gaussian noise . here",
    "we will present a general master equation for classical poisson white noise and show how it simplifies in two - level systems @xcite and reduces to gaussian white noise in the appropriate limits @xcite .    in a recent paper by jing et al . @xcite it is claimed that poisson noise can counterintuitely help improve adiabaticity for increasing noise strength .",
    "we will show that what is referred to as strong noise is actually a large noise bias which implies a stronger hamiltonian . by coherently increasing the energy of the system ( for a fixed total time ) , one will of course",
    "improve the adiabaticity .",
    "however , we will also show that for a general quantum system with poisson noise , the system will follow specific eigenstates of the noise superoperator ( in the limit of strong noise ) in a manner analogous to the adiabatic theorem .",
    "this has been previously outlined for the case of gaussian white noise and has been connected to the effect of repeated measurements or the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is outlined as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the master equation for a general time - dependent quantum system with poisson noise is derived and its general properties discussed including the special case of a two - level system . in sec .",
    "[ sect_approx ] , we review the adiabatic approximation for density matrices and derive approximations for the cases of weak and strong poisson noise . in sec .",
