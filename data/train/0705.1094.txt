    "in this paper we consider the ginzburg - landau  free energy \" @xmath1 here @xmath2 is a bounded regular two dimensional domain of @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a complex - valued function , and @xmath5 is a vector field in @xmath6 .",
    "this functional is the free energy of the model of superconductivity developed by ginzburg and landau . in the model , @xmath7 is the vector - potential of the magnetic field , the function @xmath8 is the induced magnetic field , and the complex - valued function @xmath9 is the  order parameter \" indicating the local state of the material ( normal or superconducting ) : @xmath10 is the local density of superconducting electrons .",
    "the notation @xmath11 refers to the covariant gradient , which acts according to @xmath12 .",
    "we are interested in the regime of small @xmath13 : @xmath13 corresponds to a material constant , and small @xmath13 implies type - ii superconductivity . in this regime , @xmath9 ( because it is complex - valued ) can have zeroes with a nonzero topological degree .",
    "these defects are called the _ vortices _ of @xmath9 and are the crucial objects of interest .    by setting @xmath14 we are led to studying the simpler ginzburg - landau energy  without magnetic field \" : @xmath15 all our results will thus apply to this energy as well , by setting @xmath16 .",
    "these functionals , and in particular the vortices arising in their minimizers or critical points , have been studied intensively in the mathematics literature .",
    "we refer in particular to the books @xcite for @xmath17 and @xcite for the functional with magnetic field .",
    "the interested reader can find there more information on the physical and mathematical background .",
    "we are interested in proving lower bounds on @xmath18 , and in particular estimates which relate @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the norm of @xmath21 in the lorentz space @xmath22 .",
    "noticeably , lorentz spaces were already used in the context of the ginzburg - landau energy by lin and rivire in @xcite .",
    "their goal there was to study energy critical points in 3 dimensions , but what they used was interpolation ideas and the duality between lorentz spaces @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the ginzburg - landau energy is generally unbounded as @xmath25 ; it blows up roughly like @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number ( or total degree ) of vortices .",
    "our investigation of estimates for @xmath20 is thus part of a quest for intrinsic quantities in @xmath21 which do not blow up as @xmath28 , but rather remain of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "let us now try to explain the interest and relevance of the lorentz space @xmath22 for this problem .",
    "the space @xmath22 , also known as  weak-@xmath29 \" , is a functional space which is just  slightly larger \" than the lebesgue space @xmath29 .",
    "one simple way of defining the @xmath22 norm is by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the lebesgue measure of @xmath32 .",
    "an equivalent way is through the super - level sets of @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 for more information on lorentz spaces we refer for example to @xcite .",
    "a simple application of the cauchy - schwarz inequality in ( [ ltinorm1 ] ) allows to check that if @xmath33 is in @xmath29 then it is in @xmath22 with @xmath36 .",
    "let us now consider vortices of a complex - valued function @xmath9 in the context of ginzburg - landau . in the regime of small @xmath13",
    ", @xmath9 can have zeroes , but because of the strong penalization of the term @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be small only in ( small ) regions of characteristic size @xmath13 .",
    "then around a zero at a point @xmath39 , @xmath9 has a degree defined as the topological degree of @xmath40 as a map from a circle to @xmath41 , or in other words @xmath42 where @xmath43 is sufficiently small .",
    "one can describe the situation very roughly as follows : @xmath38 is small in a ball of radius @xmath44 , and @xmath45 outside of this ball , say in an annulus @xmath46 .",
    "the size of @xmath47 is meant to account for possible neighboring zeroes . in this annulus ,",
    "the model case is that of a radial vortex of degree @xmath48 , i.e @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the polar coordinates centered at @xmath39 , and @xmath33 is a real - valued function , close to @xmath51 in @xmath52 . when computing the @xmath53 norm of @xmath54 , we find that @xmath55 in the annulus and thus , using polar coordinates , @xmath56 this tells us that the ( square of the ) @xmath53 norm of @xmath54 blows up like @xmath57 as @xmath25 .",
    "this is a crucial fact in the analysis of ginzburg - landau , much used since @xcite .",
    "jerrard @xcite and sandier @xcite showed that this picture is actually accurate even for arbitrary configurations : without assuming that the vortex profile is radial , the inequality ( [ l2norm ] ) still holds ( the radial profile is actually the one that is minimal for the @xmath29 norm ) .",
    "moreover , any configuration with an arbitrary number of vortices can be understood as many such annuli , possibly at very close distance to each other , glued together .",
    "good lower bounds like ( [ l2norm ] ) can be added up together by keeping annuli with the same conformal type .",
    "this was the basis of the  vortex - balls construction \" that they formulated and which was used extensively to understand ginzburg - landau minimizers , in particular in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , let us calculate ( roughly ) the @xmath22 norm of @xmath54 for the above vortex .",
    "we recall that @xmath58 in the annulus @xmath59 . using the definition ( [ ltinorm2 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath60 if and only if @xmath61 .",
    "thus @xmath62 and we find @xmath63 so in contrast , the @xmath22 norm of @xmath54 _ does not blow up _ as @xmath28 .",
    "one can see that this space is critical in the sense that @xmath64 ( barely ) fails to be in @xmath53 or in @xmath65 for any @xmath66 ( its norm blows up logarithmically in all cases ) but is in @xmath22 and in all @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , from this formula ( [ ltinormvid ] ) , it is expected that the @xmath0 norm can serve to estimate the total degree @xmath69 of all the vortices of a configuration .",
    "this is convenient since the total degree @xmath69 is generally obtained via a  ball construction \" that is nonunique .",
    "on the other hand @xmath70 provides a unique and intrinsic quantity useful to evaluate the number of vortices .",
    "because of these remarks and because of the paper @xcite , it could be expected that lorentz spaces are a suitable functional setting in which to study ginzburg - landau vortices .",
    "one may point out that there are other spaces that would be critical for the profile @xmath64 , such as besov spaces ; however , it seems difficult to find an effective way of using them in connection with the ginzburg - landau energy .",
    "the main goal of our results is to give a rigorous basis to the above observations .",
    "the connection with the lorentz norm of @xmath54 is made through the  vortex - balls construction \" of jerrard and sandier , as formulated in @xcite .",
    "our estimates will in fact provide an improvement of these lower bounds by adding an extra positive term in the lower bounds , which is then related to the lorentz norm .",
    "just as in the ball construction method , one of the interests of the result is that it is valid under very few assumptions : only a very weak upper bound on the energy , even when @xmath9 has a large number of vortices , unbounded as @xmath25 .",
    "this creates serious technical difficulties but is important since such situations occur for energy minimizers when there is a large applied magnetic field , as proved in @xcite .",
    "let us point out that the estimates we prove are not on the lorentz norm of @xmath54 but rather on that of @xmath21 .",
    "the reason is that the energy @xmath18 is _ gauge - invariant _ : it satisfies @xmath71 for any smooth function @xmath72 .",
    "thus the quantity @xmath73 is not a gauge - invariant quantity , hence not an intrinsic physical quantity .",
    "this is why it is replaced by the gauge - invariant  covariant derivative \" @xmath74 .",
    "our method consists in proving the following improvement of the  ball construction \" lower bounds ( see @xcite , chapter 4 ) :    [ energy_bound ] let @xmath75 .",
    "there exists @xmath76 ( depending on @xmath77 ) such that for @xmath78 and @xmath79 both @xmath80 such that @xmath81 , the following hold .    for any @xmath82",
    ", where @xmath83 is a universal constant , there exists a finite , disjoint collection of closed balls , denoted by @xmath84 , with the following properties .",
    "the sum of the radii of the balls in the collection is @xmath43 .",
    "\\2 . defining @xmath85 ,",
    "we have    @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "we have @xmath88 where @xmath89 is some explicitly constructed vector field , @xmath90 denotes @xmath91 if @xmath92 and @xmath93 otherwise , @xmath94 is assumed to be nonzero , and @xmath83 is universal .",
    "the improvement with respect to theorem 4.1 in @xcite is the addition of the extra term @xmath95 .",
    "the term @xmath89 is a vector - field constructed in the course of the ball construction , which essentially compensates for the expected behavior of @xmath21 in the vortices .",
    "one can take it to be @xmath96 in every annulus of the ball construction where @xmath9 has a constant degree @xmath48 , @xmath97 denotes the unit tangent vector to each circle centered at @xmath39 , the center of the annulus , and @xmath98 . by extending @xmath89 to be zero outside of the union of balls @xmath99",
    ", we easily deduce :    let @xmath100 be as above , then @xmath101 where @xmath89 is the explicitly constructed vector field of theorem [ energy_bound ] , and @xmath83 a universal constant .",
    "the right - hand side of this inequality can be considered as the  energy - excess \" , difference between the total energy and the expected vortex energy provided by the ball construction lower bounds .",
    "thus we control @xmath102 by the energy - excess .",
    "this fact is used repeatedly in the sequel paper @xcite to better understand the behavior of @xmath21 for minimizers and almost minimizers of the ginzburg - landau energy with applied magnetic field .",
    "one can also note that such a control ( [ vjs ] ) has a similar flavor to a result of jerrard - spirn @xcite where they control the difference ( in a weaker norm but with better control ) of the jacobian of @xmath9 to a measure of the form @xmath103 by the energy - excess .",
    "once theorem [ energy_bound ] is proved , we turn to obtaining an @xmath24 estimate from which @xmath89 has disappeared . in order to do so , we can bound below @xmath104 by @xmath105 ; the more delicate task is then to control @xmath106 in a way that only depends on the final data of the theorem , that is on the degrees of the final balls constructed above and on the energy .",
    "this task is complicated by the possible presence of large numbers of vortices very close to each other , and compensations of vortices of large positive degrees with vortices of large negative degrees . to overcome this ,",
    "@xmath89 is not defined exactly as previously said , but in a modified way , and @xmath106 is controlled not only through the degrees but also through the total energy .",
    "we then arrive at the following main result :    [ norm_switch ] assume the hypotheses and results of theorem [ energy_bound ] .",
    "then there exists a universal constant @xmath83 such that @xmath107 where the sums are taken over all the balls @xmath108 in the final collection @xmath84 that are included in @xmath109 .",
    "this theorem bounds below the energy contained in the union of balls @xmath99 in terms of the @xmath22 norm on @xmath99 .",
    "it is a simple matter to extend these estimates to all of @xmath2 , and deduce a control of the @xmath22 norm of @xmath21 by the energy - excess , plus the term @xmath110 .",
    "this is the content of the following corollary .",
    "[ coro1 ] assuming the hypotheses and results of theorem [ energy_bound ] , there exists a universal constant @xmath83 such that @xmath111 where the sums are taken over all the balls @xmath108 in the final collection @xmath84 that are included in @xmath109 .",
    "these estimates can indeed help to bound from above @xmath112 by the total number of vortices , provided we can control the energy - excess by that number of vortices .",
    "this can in turn serve to obtain stronger convergence results when a weak limit of @xmath21 is known .",
    "for example , if one considers the energy @xmath17 ( which we recall amounts to setting @xmath16 ) , it is known from bethuel - brezis - hlein @xcite that @xmath113 is the leading order of the energy ( at least for minimizers ) and that the next order term is a term of order 1 , called the  renormalized energy \" @xmath114 , that accounts for the interaction between the vortices .",
    "the upper bound of corollary [ coro1 ] roughly tells us that @xmath115 it is expected that the total cost of interaction of the vortices in @xmath114 is of order of @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the total vorticity mass ( here @xmath27 can blow up as @xmath25 ) .",
    "thus , we obtain a bound of the form @xmath118 which indeed bounds the @xmath22 norm of @xmath54 by an order of @xmath119 , the total vorticity mass , as expected in the heuristic calculations of section [ idealv ] .    in the simplest case",
    "where we know that @xmath120 , which happens for energy minimizers when @xmath27 is bounded , as proved in @xcite , we then deduce that @xmath121 . to be more precise , for the minimizers of @xmath17 found in @xcite , we have    [ corobbh ]    let @xmath2 be starshaped and @xmath122 minimize @xmath17 under the constraint @xmath123 on @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a fixed @xmath41-valued map of degree @xmath126 on the boundary of @xmath2 , as studied in @xcite .",
    "then there exists a universal constant @xmath83 such that @xmath127 moreover , as @xmath25 , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the @xmath130-valued  canonical harmonic map \" of @xcite to which converges @xmath9 in @xmath131 outside of a set of @xmath48 vortex points .",
    "note that the renormalized energy @xmath114 depends on @xmath125 ( hence on @xmath48 ) , and the @xmath132 is not optimal here ; rather , it should be @xmath48 .",
    "it is more delicate to obtain this kind of improvement to the estimate ; this is one of the things done in @xcite in the context of the energy with applied magnetic field . also the convergence of @xmath133 _",
    "can not be strengthened _ , convergence in @xmath22 strong does not hold , as illustrated by the following model case : let @xmath134 be the vector field @xmath135 and @xmath136 with @xmath137 as @xmath25 .",
    "then @xmath138 , while clearly @xmath139 weakly-@xmath140 in @xmath22 .",
    "we have focused on proving upper bounds on @xmath141 in terms of its @xmath53 norm and ginzburg - landau energy .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain some adapted , though not optimal , lower bounds .",
    "for example , we can prove the following :    [ proplb ] let @xmath142 be such that @xmath143 for some @xmath144 .",
    "then @xmath145    this proposition is a direct consequence of the definition of the @xmath22 norm .",
    "its short proof is presented in section [ l_2_inf_discussion ] .    for critical points of the ginzburg - landau energy",
    ", it is known that the gradient bound @xmath146 holds . thus applying proposition [ proplb ] to @xmath147 , we find @xmath148 knowing some lower bounds ( provided by the ball construction ) of the type @xmath149 , where @xmath27 is the total degree of the vortices , we find lower bounds of the type @xmath150 , also relating the @xmath22 norm of @xmath21 to the total number of vortices .    in @xcite , which is the sequel of this paper ,",
    "the ideas and main results of this paper are extended to the case of the full ginzburg - landau energy with an applied magnetic field , getting better estimates on @xmath151 in terms of the number of vortices .",
    "these results lead to a somewhat stronger ( than previously known results ) convergence of @xmath21 and of the jacobian determinants of @xmath9 when certain energy conditions are fulfilled .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , for the convenience of the reader , we give a review ( with slight modifications ) of the crucial definitions and ingredients for the vortex - balls construction following chapter 4 of @xcite .    in section 3",
    "we present the main argument , with the introduction of the function @xmath89 and the `` trick '' that allows us to gain an extra term in the lower bounds for the energy on annuli .    in section 4",
    "we show how this extra term incorporates into the estimates through the growing and merging of balls , and hence through the whole ball construction .    in section 5",
    "we deduce the proof of the main results .    in section 6",
    "we estimate the @xmath22 norm of @xmath89 in order to pass from theorem [ energy_bound ] to theorem [ norm_switch ] .",
    "this is the only section in which @xmath22 comes into play .    in section 7",
    "we show how the methods of this paper can be adapted to work with the version of the ball construction formulated by jerrard in @xcite , at the expense of less control of @xmath152 .",
    "in finding lower bounds for the ginzburg - landau energy of a configuration @xmath100 it is most convenient to work on annuli , the deleted interior discs of which contain the set where @xmath9 is near @xmath93 , and in particular the vortices . on each annulus , a lower bound",
    "is found in terms of a topological term ( the degree of the vortex ) and a conformal factor , which we define to be the logarithm of the ratio of the outer and inner radii of the annulus .",
    "therefore , to create useful lower bounds we must be able to identify the set where @xmath9 is near @xmath93 and then create a family of annuli with large conformal type outside this set .",
    "the first component of the process uses energy methods to find a covering of the set by small , disjoint balls , and is addressed later .",
    "the second component is known as the general ball growth method and is presented in this section . here",
    "we follow the construction of chapter 4 from @xcite .    as a technical tool we will need the ability to merge two tangent or overlapping balls into a single ball that contains the original balls , and with the property that its radius is equal to the sum of the radii of the original balls .",
    "our first lemma recalls how to do such a merging .",
    "we write @xmath153 for the radius of a ball @xmath108 .",
    "[ ball_merging ] let @xmath154 and @xmath155 be closed balls in @xmath156 such that @xmath157 .",
    "then there is a closed ball @xmath108 such that @xmath158 and @xmath159 .    if @xmath160 and @xmath161 , then @xmath162 has the desired properties .",
    "the ball growth lemma now provides an algorithm for growing an initial collection of small balls into a final collection of large balls .",
    "essentially , the balls in a collection are grown concentrically by increasing their radii by the same conformal factor .",
    "this is continued until a tangency occurs , at which point the previous lemma is used to merge the tangent balls .",
    "the process is then repeated in stages until the collection is of the desired size .",
    "the annuli of interest at each stage are formed by deleting the initial collection of balls from the final collection ; the construction guarantees that all of the annuli in a stage have the same conformal type .",
    "given a finite collection of disjoint balls , @xmath84 , we define the radius of the collection , @xmath163 , to be the sum of the radii of the balls in the collection , i.e. @xmath164 for any @xmath165 and any ball @xmath166 we define @xmath167 . extending this notation to collections of balls ,",
    "we write @xmath168 . for an annulus @xmath169",

    "the use of this parameter causes trouble above since @xmath849 .",
    "the second major difference in the two methods is in how they pass from lower bounds on circles , which in both methods are most conveniently calculated by estimating @xmath850 from below , to lower bounds of @xmath851 on annuli and balls . above",
    "we employ the co - area formula in lemma [ co_area_subset ] and in of theorem [ energy_bound ] to accomplish this .",

    "the third major difference is in the nature of the lower bounds .",
    "the method above produces lower bounds on the total collection of balls but can not say much about the energy content of any given ball in the collection .",
    "because of its use of the @xmath862 function , which only depends on the parameter @xmath450 , the jerrard construction can localize the lower bounds to each ball in the collection .",
    "in particular , proposition 4.1 of @xcite , the analogue of our theorem [ energy_bound ] , shows that there exists a @xmath863 such that for any @xmath864 there exists a collection of disjoint balls @xmath845 with radii @xmath677 and degrees @xmath865 such that @xmath866 where @xmath867 $ ] . in particular",

    "<S> in this paper we prove novel lower bounds for the ginzburg - landau energy with or without magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> these bounds rely on an improvement of the `` vortex balls construction '' estimates by extracting a new positive term in the energy lower bounds . </S>",
    "<S> this extra term can be conveniently estimated through a lorentz space norm , on which it thus provides an upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz space @xmath0 we use is critical with respect to the expected vortex profiles and can serve to estimate the total number of vortices and get improved convergence results . </S>"
