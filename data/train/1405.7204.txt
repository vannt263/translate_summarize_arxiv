    "this method makes use of a non - linear optical medium to probabilistically transform a fraction of a strong pump beam into pairs of correlated output photons denoted as signal and idler .",
    "photons generated in the process of spdc originate randomly , but always in pairs .",
    "consequently there are strong temporal @xcite and spatial @xcite correlations between signal and idler photons of the same pair .",
    "specific geometric configurations of this process yield two undistinguishable photons suitable for a large number of applications including cryptography @xcite and quantum gates @xcite .",

    "the same laser beam used to pump spdc also excites the medium and induces luminescence .",
    "this effect is intrinsic to the spdc - based single - photon sources and constitutes a non - removable source of noise .",
    "such noise can have severe a impact on the quality of the generated single - photon states .",
    "in fact , high - fidelity single photon sources are a crucial prerequisite for the successful implementation of a large number of quantum - optics experiments . in quantum cryptography , for instance , deteriorated single - photon states can even lead to security breach @xcite . similarly in quantum metrology , a low fidelity of input states of light has a negative influence on measurement precision .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of luminescence - induced noise by analyzing time - resolved luminescence of -bab@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bbo ) crystals ( see typical case in fig [ fig : streak ] ) .",
    "bbo is a prominent material often used in non - linear optics for its suitable properties , especially in uv region @xcite .",

    "luminescence in bbo material has been previously discussed in some papers @xcite .",
    "these publications however focus on thermally stimulated luminescence @xcite or impurities in bbo powders @xcite and do not analyse luminescence in the context of noise in single photon generation . considering the importance of single photon sources and the significant impact the presence of additional luminescence may have on their quality , we believe that our study is of sizeable importance for future development of spdc - based single - photon sources .",

    "optical components are denoted as follows : ndf  neutral density filter , hwp  half - wave plate , bbo  bbo crystal , lp  linear polariser , fc  fibre coupler . ]    our experimental setup ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) is based on a tunable optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) powered by an amplified femtosecond ( fs ) ti : sapphire laser system ( coherent legend / opera ) , which is used as the pump beam .",
    "central wavelengths of the opa - emitted pulses are ranging from 240 to . the typical opa output power is about at repetition rate and the pulse duration is about .    in the first step ,",
    "we subject the opa output beam to a tunable neutral density filter ( ndf ) and a half - wave plate ( hwp ) allowing us to set required power and polarization . after this preparation stage ,",
    "the laser beam impinges on a bbo crystal , where it induces both luminescence and spdc .",
    "light emerging from the crystal is collected by a fiber coupler equipped with a linear polariser ( lp ) , allowing us to perform a polarization analysis of the signal .",
    "the bbo crystal is mounted on a rotation stage positioned so that frequency - degenerate type - i spdc process is emitted towards the fiber coupler in the different phase - matching conditions .",
    "the signal collected by the fiber coupler is subsequently transferred by a multi - mode optical fiber to the entrance of a czerny - turner spectrograph , where it gets spectrally separated in the horizontal direction . finally , in a streak camera ( hamamatsu c10910 - 01 ) ,",
    "the light pulses get also time - separated in the vertical direction thus creating an image with spectral resolution along the horizontal axis and time resolution along the vertical one .",
    "typical recording of the signal is depicted in fig [ fig : streak ] .",
    "the crystal used throughout this experiment was manufactured by ekspla ( cut angle 48 , dimensions @xmath2mm@xmath3 ) .",
    "using the experimental setup described in the previous section , we acquired data for various settings of pump - pulse central wavelength , power and polarization . in this section , we provide structured presentation of the observed results .",
    "( color online ) spectral properties of both spdc and luminescence signal : a ) both spdc and luminescence are emitted , b ) spdc is turned off by rotating the half - wave plate ( hwp ) , c ) spdc is blocked by linear polariser ( lp ) .",
    "see text for details.,width=321 ]    first of all , we evaluated spectral ( time - integrated ) properties of both spdc generated photons and luminescence .",
    "typical measurement outcome is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral1 ] . in this figure",
    ", we show the spectra of our signal in three distinct configurations , all measured with the pump wavelength set to .",
    "first , we set the pump - beam polarization to satisfy phase matching conditions . in this regime , we observe a double peak blob of combined spdc and luminescence signal . in the second configuration",
    ", we set orthogonal pump beam polarization ( by rotating hwp ) so that the phase - matching conditions are no longer satisfied .",
    "as expected , the spdc is turned off and only the luminescence signal remains . finally , we reset the pump beam polarization to satisfy the phase matching conditions and inserted a linear polarizer ( lp ) in front of the fiber coupler to filter out the linearly polarized spdc .",
    "since the luminescence photons have mixed polarization states , we still observe about one half of the luminescence passing through the linear polarizer .",
    "this set of three measurements allows us to identify spectra belonging to the spdc and luminescence respectively .",
    "we also conclude that there is a non - negligible spectral overlap between the two .",
    "( color online ) renormalized spectra of luminescence as function of central pump wavelength.,width=321 ]    as stated above , the bbo crystal is always rotated to satisfy degenerate phase - matching conditions .",
    "therefore the spdc central wavelength doubles that of the pump beam . on the other hand , luminescence spectra as a function of the central pump wavelength",
    "are to be analyzed .",
    "we have therefore acquired luminescence spectra for various pump - beam central wavelengths .",
    "the data are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral2 ] .",
    "note that for the sake of better readability , the spectral intensities in the plot are normalized to their peak .",
    "[ fig : spectral2 ] shows that , apart from , the luminescence spectra are skewed towards longer wavelengths , do not depend on the pumping wavelength and have maxima at about .",
    "we conclude this analysis by stating that in the range of 240  of central pump wavelength , the luminescence spectra overlap with spdc .",
    "the overlap is more significant when using shorter pump wavelengths and is expected to reach a maximum for about of pump wavelength , which is unfortunately unavailable to our opa .    to complete the spectral analysis , we have also investigated the influence of the pump power on luminescence spectra .",
    "the pump wavelength was fixed at while the pump power ranged from 10  .",
    "the observed results do not indicate any shift in the luminescence spectra as a function of pump power .",
    "moreover , as expected , the luminescence intensity scales linearly with the pump power ( data not shown ) .",
    "all the spectral measurements indicate that there is an unavoidable spectral overlap between luminescence and spdc when pumping with wavelengths between 240 and .",
    "the luminescence will thus inevitably generate noise in the spdc signal .",
    "there are generally two possible courses of action to remove this luminescence - induced noise from the spdc spectra .",
    "the first option is to shift the pumping wavelength above so that the luminescence and spdc have only a negligible spectral overlap .",
    "this approach would however shift the spdc central wavelength .",
    "the second option is to use edge or interference filters to cut out as much luminescence as possible .",
    "this way , one can certainly reduce the amount of noise in spdc signal , but only to some extent given by their spectral overlap .",
    "also note that typical interference filters have non - unit transmissivity even in their transmission maxima and therefore introduce signal losses .",
    "we conclude this subsection stating that simple spectral filtering is not sufficient to completely remove the luminescence noise from spdc signal and can only be used to correct this issue partially and usually also at the expenses of signal losses .",
    "( color online ) temporal profile of combined spdc and luminescence emission ( a ) .",
    "notice the sharp peak corresponding to the instantaneous process of spdc ( b ) and the subsequent exponential decay of luminescence ( c ) .",
    "the measured time duration of the spdc coincides with the instrument response function ( irf ) at the given streak - camera settings , width=321 ]    the photons originating from the spdc process are generated almost instantaneously as the pump pulse propagates through the bbo crystal , since they are described by electron transitions to virtual levels .",
    "luminescence , on the other hand , has its typical exponential decay due to a life - time of electrons on excited energy levels .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy allows us to monitor this aspect of our signal as well . to separate spdc signal from luminescence",
    ", we have selected corresponding regions of interest as schematically illustrated in fig .",

    "we measured time - resolved spectra at different settings of the streak - camera time window , from ns to . by applying exponential fit to the data , we have identified several distinct decay processes with different decay times ( see in fig . [",
    "fig : time2 ] ) .",
    "the first decay process is a fast one with typical decay time @xmath13ns .",
    "the second and third processes are considerably slower having decay times @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the values obtained for all the decay times were established by fitting data from repeated measurements with relative uncertainty of about 7% .",
    "moreover we have established that these decay times do not depend on the pump wavelength . as an example , see fig .",
    "[ fig : time3 ] showing the decay time @xmath8 as a function of pump wavelength . similarly , no dependence of the decay times on pumping power has been observed . considering the above determined facts",
    ", we can assess the potential of temporal filtration to remove the luminescence generated noise . in quantum - optics experiments",
    ", there is usually some sort of detection window used to filter real signals from noise or detector dark counts .",
    "typical widths of such detection window are of the order of units of nanoseconds which roughly coincides with the fastest observed decay time @xmath9 .",
    "therefore detection window can not serve to filter out the fastest decaying luminescence signal . on the other hand ,",
    "it can , under some circumstances , be used to filter out the slower luminescence emission .",
    "doing so would require using pulsed pumping and reducing the overall repetition rate in the experiment ( to about 100khz ) to allow for the luminescence to extinguish before new detection window is opened .",
    "this strategy can not be adopted with continuous pumping since it would only limit the amount of luminescence added noise , without removing it completely .",
    "so far we have determined both spectral and temporal properties of luminescence in bbo crystals .",
    "the results of the two previous subsections indicate that some reduction of luminescence induced noise can be achieved using spectral and temporal filtering .",
    "complete removal of luminescence noise is however impossible . in this subsection",
    "we quantify the influence of luminescence on single - photon - source quality by analyzing a typical heralded single - photon source .    in order to study such model ,",
    "let us consider typical parameters of heralded single photon sources : rate of single photon generation @xmath16khz ( number of signal photons detected per 1s ) and detection window @xmath17ns ( window in which we expect the signal photon to appear ) .",
    "these values are based on recent experiments in the field of linear - optical quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "note that for the purposes of subsequent quantitative model , we have considered a pump wavelength of 267 nm ( fourth harmonics of nd - yag laser ) and ideal binary detectors with unity quantum efficiency .",
    "the probability of generating a pair of spdc photons can now be expressed as @xmath18 . under these assumptions",
    ", we can readily neglect simultaneous generation of two spdc photon pairs that appear with probability of @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , we can define luminescence - photon rate @xmath20 and luminescence probability @xmath21 to be used in forthcoming calculations .",
    "assuming that the luminescence rate is of the same order as the spdc rate or lower , we can neglect the probability of simultaneous generation of two luminescence photons within one detection window .",
    "ideally , a perfect heralded single photon source yields a signal photon in the pure fock state @xmath22 every time the idler photon is detected .",
    "due to luminescence , such a source will however yield a mixed state in the form of @xmath23    where the normalization @xmath24 will be calculated later .",
    "the vacuum term @xmath25 appears due to ` false heralding ' by a luminescence photon in the idler mode instead of genuine spdc idler photon .",
    "since luminescence photons do not originate in pairs , the signal mode is in vacuum state even if the detector in idler mode clicks . considering that this situation happens",
    "every time a luminescence photon is detected not being accompanied by spdc photons within one detection window , we obtain @xmath26 the only desired term @xmath22 appears with a success probability @xmath27 corresponding to the spdc photon being generated in the signal mode without the luminescence photon @xmath28    and finally , one observes the state @xmath29 if both the spdc and luminescence photon are emitted in the signal mode @xmath30 note that @xmath31 since we have not taken into account the remaining case of neither spdc nor luminescence photons being emitted .",
    "this case corresponds to the source not heralding signal photon presence and thus it does not contribute the effective outgoing state , but it only reduces the success probability . in order to correctly normalize the density matrix @xmath32",
    ", we set @xmath33    the quality of generated quantum state is typically expressed by the fidelity @xmath34 , which in our case takes the form @xmath35",

    "resulting calculation of snr and fidelity @xmath34 is also presented . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     time - resolved spectroscopy allows us to separate spdc and luminescence signal by performing intensity integration over suitable regions of interest .",
    "this way , we determine the spdc - to - luminescence count ratio , or signal - to - noise ratio @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote spdc and luminescence photon counts respectively .",
    "it also follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : snr ] ) that realistic detector efficiency @xmath40 will not affect the resulting snr since both @xmath41 and @xmath20 will be rescaled by the same factor @xmath40 .",
    "the fidelity can be now expressed using snr in the form of @xmath42 where the last approximation holds for low generation probability .",
    "we have calculated the expected value of fidelity for several different scenarios : ( i ) no spectral or time filtering of luminescence , ( ii ) spectral filtering only by a long - pass edge filter with cut - off at 460 nm ( e.g. continuous pump ) and ( iii ) both spectral and temporal filtering .",
    "for all calculations , we have assumed the above mentioned typical values of @xmath43 and @xmath41 while using experimentally acquired values of snr .",
    "values are summarized in table [ tab : fidelity ] .",
    "as we can see , without simultaneous spectral and temporal - filtering , the fidelity is significantly reduced .",
    "only when both the spectral and temporal - filtering are applied , the fidelity approaches its theoretical limit @xmath44 .",
    "spectral filtering alone can achieve about half of this improvement .",
    "in this paper we have characterized luminescence noise in spdc - based single - photon sources using bbo crystals . we have observed that spdc and luminescence spectra at least partially overlap when the pump wavelength is set in the range 240  290 nm .",
    "this fact , together with mixed polarization state of luminescence photons , leads to the impossibility of a complete purification of the single photon source using spectral filtering only . in the next step ,",
    "we have measured temporal characteristics of the luminescence noise .",
    "data indicate that there are faster ( ns ) and slower ( ) luminescence decays . at the expenses of a lower experiment repetition rate ,",
    "the slower luminescence signal can be removed by a proper temporal gating .",
    "the faster process however remains an issue for typical gating windows ( about 10ns ) .",
    "the last section of our study provides a quantitative model of a typical experimental configuration .",
    "we have defined the fidelity of a single - photon source and showed that only precise spectral and time - filtering allows for quasi - complete removal of the luminescence noise . in our model ,",
    "spectral filtering alone allows for fidelity to exceed @xmath45 , while entirely without filtering the fidelity reaches a value of about @xmath46 .",
