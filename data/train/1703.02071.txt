    "the recent cosmological measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) at the percent level , and measurements of the redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) signals at the few percent level , in the clustering of galaxies selected from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; @xcite ) , part of the sloan digital sky survey iii @xcite , have clearly demonstrated the power of such measurements to understand the low - redshift universe @xcite . over the next decade , surveys including eboss @xcite , desi @xcite , and euclid @xcite , will provide an order of magnitude improvement on these constraints , helping us to understand dark energy .",
    "given the significant investment in these spectroscopic surveys , it is imperative to extract as much information as possible from them .",
    "one avenue that has been relatively unexploited until now is the possibility of using extended target sample data to enhance the spectroscopic measurements of a subset of it .",
    "it is common to be in the position of only having spectroscopic data for a subsample of targets .",
    "for example , the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey ( vipers ; @xcite ) spectroscopically observed @xmath1deg@xmath2 of the @xmath3deg@xmath2 canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) wide photometric catalogue .",
    "similarly , the boss dr9 analyses presented in @xcite used @xmath4deg@xmath2 of spectroscopic data , out of a target sample covering @xmath5deg@xmath2 .",
    "an obvious question is `` how best to use the extra target data to enhance the 3d clustering measurements ? '' .",
    "we argue here that angular pair upweighting does this .",
    "angular pair upweighting has previously been used to partially correct for spectroscopic completeness .",
    "it was used in @xcite to correct for missing close pairs in the 2dfgrs @xcite .",
    "it was also used in recent analyses of the vipers data : the pattern of observations allowed by the vimos instrument meant that the vipers galaxy clustering signal was strongly distorted by the spectroscopic completeness . @xcite and @xcite used angular pair weighted to correct for the incompletenesses , weighting pairs counted in a 3d correlation function measurement by the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angular correlation function , subscript @xmath8 denotes the spectroscopic sample , and @xmath9 the photometric sample .",
    "we investigate the utility of angular pair upweighting , not to correct for missing observations , but to improve on 3d clustering measurements . in our companion paper @xcite",
    "we present a new scheme to de - bias measurements from the effects of systematically missing observations , showing that angular pair upweighting alone only partially alleviates the effects .",
    "however , in @xcite , we argue that if forms part of a more complicated scheme to correct for missing observations that uses angular pair upweighting to recoup lost signal - to - noise .",
    "the investigation described here shows that it has the potential for wider application in the analysis of spectroscopic galaxy surveys .    in section  [ sec : unc - pairs ]",
    ", we present a toy analytic model for angular pair upweighting , for the simple situation of uncorrelated 3d pair measurements in a single bin in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is extended to correlated pairs in section  [ sec : corr - pairs ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "mocks ] we present an analysis of mock catalogues designed to match the dr12 boss sample , showing how angular clustering measurements from a wide area can enhance 3d clustering measurements .",
    "our results are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we first present an analytic toy model demonstrating the basic idea of pair upweighting .",
    "we have matched the notation of @xcite , so we can use their method for describing pair counts within surveys , and our equations can be directly compared to theirs .",
    "consider @xmath12 objects angularly distributed within a region @xmath13 with dimensionless geometric form factor @xmath14 , which encodes the geometry of the survey ( as in @xcite ) as a distribution of pairs separated by @xmath15 .",
    "now consider a representative sample of galaxies that have spectroscopic data , denoted with a subscript @xmath16 .",
    "the expected number of pairs in an angular bin is given by , @xmath17 given spectroscopic information , suppose that @xmath18 of these are placed in the radial bin @xmath19 with selection probability @xmath20 .",
    "for the selection probability , we drop the subscript @xmath16 as we assume that this sample has representative selection .",
    "we have from bayes theorem that @xmath21 for uncorrelated pair counts , @xmath18 has a binomial distribution , and we assume that @xmath22 is drawn from a zero - truncated poisson distribution ( as we need at least one pair in each angular bin , to be able to divide by the observed pair counts ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : bayes1 ] ) to solve for the mean and variance gives that @xmath23 and @xmath24 where we have written @xmath25 for simplicity . in the limit of large @xmath26 , this reduces to the standard poisson result of both the mean and variance equalling @xmath27 . here ,",
    "when calculating the variance , we have ignored the effect of triplets , as considered , for example , in @xcite , and assume that the dominant error term is poisson .",
    "now suppose that we introduce angular sample @xmath28 for which we do not have radial information , but that has clustering that is statistically identical ( i.e. the targets are drawn with the same expected radial pdf ) to that of sample @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that sample @xmath28 is independent of sample @xmath16 , and will construct our estimator by combining both , so that we now have @xmath29 we wish to use the combined information from both samples to form a maximum likelihood estimator for the expected number of angular pairs in sample @xmath16 .",
    "provided that @xmath30 and @xmath31 have similar distributions , then we can construct this by simply summing the regions together @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the relative areas covered by samples @xmath16 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "angular pair upweighting treats @xmath35 as a weight to be applied to @xmath18 to give @xmath36 @xmath37 assuming that both @xmath22 and @xmath38 are drawn from zero - truncated poisson distributions , we see that the mean is unchanged .",
    "i.e. @xmath39 working in the limit where @xmath26 and @xmath40 are large so that @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the variance is changed to @xmath44 @xmath45.\\ ] ] taking the limit of large @xmath26 , and rewriting areas in terms of @xmath26 and @xmath40 , the difference between this and the original variance reduces to the simple form @xmath46 and we clearly see that @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "the numerator of @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vimprov ] ) shows that the improvement in the variance is proportional to the fraction of pairs entering each radial bin .",
    "the denominator shows that the maximum fractional improvement of @xmath49 , is logarithmically reached in the limit of large @xmath50 .",
    "the relation between the 3d correlation function and it s angular and radial components can be written @xmath51 where @xmath7 is the angular correlation function , and @xmath52 is the radial correlation function for pairs within this angular bin . as explained in @xcite , because our sample geometry limits the distribution of pairs in both angular and radial directions , the relation between the measured clustering and the true correlation function requires an `` integral constraint '' .",
    "thus , with clustering , eq .  [ eq : np1-noc ] becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 similarly in the radial direction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mp1-noc ] ) becomes @xmath55 where @xmath56    , calculated from 100 of the 1000 qpm mocks used , matching the ngp component of the dr12 boss cmass sample ( black lines ) .",
    "the overplotted white line shows the mean , with 1@xmath57 errors .",
    "[ fig : cmass - xi0],width=321 ]    thus we see that the effect of clustering , including both the correlation functions and integral constraints , can be absorbed into the geometric factors . defining @xmath58",
    "we can use the results of section  [ sec : unc - pairs ] , with the transform @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we have tested the utility of angular pair upweighting using the mock catalogues created to match the data release 12 ( dr12 ; @xcite ) galaxy sample of boss .",
    "specifically we have analysed 1000 mock catalogues created from quick particle mesh ( qpm ; @xcite ) simulations designed to mimic the dr12 cmass galaxy sample .",
    "we also analyse 1000 mock catalogues created using the multidark - patchy ( hereafter md - patchy ; @xcite ) technique designed to mimic the dr12 lowz galaxy sample .",
    "see @xcite for details of the boss galaxy samples .",
    "md - patchy uses second - order lagrangian perturbation theory and a stochastic halo biasing scheme calibrated using the multi - dark simulation , while qpm selects haloes from low - resolution particle mesh simulations such that they match the expected 1-point and 2-point statistics . for both methods",
    ", halos are populated using a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model to construct galaxy density fields .",
    "each mock is then sampled to match both the angular and radial selection functions of the survey .",
    "thus we compare results using two mock catalogue production schemes and two different target samples .",
    "as we only wish to provide a proof - of - concept , we do not perform reconstruction , a technique to remove the smearing effect of bulk motions - combining angular pair upweighting with reconstruction is discussed further in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we only consider the north galactic cap ( ngc ) part of the survey : the cmass sample contains @xmath61 galaxies , while the lowz sample contains @xmath62 galaxies .    , but now for the angular correlation function of 100 of the qpm cmass mocks , binned into bins of width @xmath63degrees .",
    "[ fig : cmass - wt],width=321 ]    to quantify the survey masks of both the cmass and lowz samples , we used a catalogue of points chosen randomly to sample the survey regions , containing 20@xmath64 as many points as the number of galaxies in each sample . using the galaxy and random catalogues we have measured galaxy - galaxy ( dd ) , galaxy - random ( dr ) and random - random ( rr ) pair - counts .",
    "the pair - counts were binned into @xmath65 bins with separation @xmath66 , @xmath67 and linearly spaced in @xmath68degrees for cmass and @xmath69degrees for lowz .",
    "we include pairs that are within the angular range considered , but have @xmath70 in the final bin in @xmath10 , so that our angular clustering can be measured as if there were no radial information .",
    "the range of angles considered is driven by calculating @xmath7 for the pairs with the separations of interest , and so is different for lowz and cmass samples .",
    "we have tried a number of resolutions for the angular pair count bins , and find that it does not significantly influence the results : for simplicity we downsample the angular pair counts by a factor of 5 for the results presented . as we only consider the monopole moment , we do not additionally bin in @xmath71 , the cosine of the angle to the line - of - sight , although we would expect angular pair weighting to help improve the full 3d correlation function for all @xmath71 except @xmath72 , which corresponds to @xmath73 and where the angular correlations are formally both zero .",
    "using the @xcite estimator , we used these pair counts to measure the monopole moment of the correlation function for each mock catalogue . for a selection of the qpm cmass mocks ,",
    "these are plotted against their mean and variance in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmass - xi0 ] .",
    "we wish to contrast the measured variance of the monopole correlation function with that obtained using angular pair upweighting as if we had a wider area of projected angular data . we have calculated the angular correlation function for mock @xmath74 , @xmath75 , where we take the binned pair counts described above for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 split by @xmath11 and use the @xcite estimator : the angular correlation functions for a selection of the qpm cmass mocks are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmass - wt ] . in order to consider an angular clustering measurement made as if from a wider survey , we average angular pair - counts from the mock of interest and @xmath79 additional mocks , creating a lower - variance estimate of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 angular pair - counts : @xmath82 and similarly for @xmath83 . we determine the ratios of counts in the low variance estimate to that from the individual mock , @xmath84 and @xmath85 in bins of width @xmath63degrees .",
    "we use this ratio to weight the paircounts for each bin in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so our weighted estimate for @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 the monopole moment of the correlation function was then recalculated for each mock using @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 is unchanged as we use the same random catalogue for all mocks .",
    "the average weighted monopole matches the unweighted average with differences at the level expected from noise .",
    "- i.e. between twice and 10@xmath64 the area .",
    "@xmath91 is the unweighted variance , and @xmath92 is the variance after angular pair upweighting .",
    "[ fig : cmass - variance],width=321 ]     the area .",
    "@xmath93 is the element of the covariance matrix for @xmath94 between bins @xmath74 and @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the covariance matrix element for the weighted correlation function .",

    "[ fig : cmass - variance ] presents the fractional improvement in the variance obtained for the cmass dr12 qpm mocks .",
    "we show the potential improvement as if we had between @xmath97 and @xmath98 the angular data with which to weight the 3d pair counts .",
    "although unrealistic for boss , as the area covered by the ngp sample is already @xmath99deg@xmath2 , this demonstrates the logarithmic improvement to the 3d clustering measurements possible with increasing amounts of angular data , matching the asymptotic behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ eq : improv ] ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : cmass - mat ] shows that the improvement in the covariance extends to the off - diagonal elements . for simplicity ,",
    "we only show the improvement for the case of having @xmath98 the angular data with which to weight the 3d pair counts .    , but now for the md - patchy lowz mocks .",
    "[ fig : lowz - variance],width=321 ]    the fractional improvement for the lowz dr12 md - patchy mocks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowz - variance ] . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmass - variance ] , we show the potential improvement as if we had between @xmath97 and @xmath98 the angular data with which to weight the 3d pair counts .",
    "the improvement for lowz is slightly worse than that for cmass , asymptoting to a @xmath010% improvement on bao scales for large angular target areas .",
    "we have presented analytic and numerical arguments that angular - pair upweighting is an efficient method to enhance the 3d clustering measurements from spectroscopic surveys , when angular clustering data is available over a larger area than that observed spectroscopically .",
    "results from both the analytic derivation and from mock catalogues show improvement in the error on the resulting 3d correlation function measurements . we have also shown that angular pair upweighting gives rise to unbiased clustering measurements .",
    "in essence , the method works by exploiting the correlation between angular and 3d clustering : by dividing the spectroscopic pair counts by the angular pair counts , we remove this component of the noise , and we then multiply by an estimator with the same mean but lower noise to get back to an unbiased estimate of the 3d pair counts . in terms of radial and angular modes , we are using additional angular data to reduce the error on the contribution of these modes to the 3d clustering measurement .",
    "our analysis of mock catalogues shows a larger improvement than that in the toy analytic model : we expect this is because the monopole correlation function measurements are correlated across different @xmath10 , unlike the toy model .",
    "angular projection acts as a smoothing of the 3d clustering signal with an asymmetric kernel , and so the correlations between angular and 3d @xmath100 will be increased by coherence in the 3d @xmath100- i.e. the correlations in the clustering signal mimic slightly those of the angular projection .",
    "there are some caveats to the analysis presented : in particular , we have only tested the efficiency of pair upweighting using binned data",
    ". it would be possible to provide a weight for every galaxy pair using the actual separation ( this was the procedure adopted in @xcite ) .",
    "however , using the binned counts is conservative and , given the number and size of the boss mocks used , using individual weights for each pair would have been prohibitively expensive .",
    "it is not obvious how the proposed upweighting would affect clustering measurements post - reconstruction of the density field , which has become an essential part of bao analyses .",
    "however , it should be possible to reap the benefits of pair upweighting , while including the information from reconstruction by following the recent work of @xcite .",
    "this suggested that the combination of post - reconstruction and weighted pre - recon measurement could be performed after parameter measurement , while retaining the information from both .",
    "practically , one would calculate upweighted pre - reconstruction clustering and non - weighted post - reconstruction clustering , and combine the measurements of cosmological parameters from both to form combined parameter measurements , allowing for correlations between measurements .",
    "the angular upweighting would reduce the correlation between pre- and post - reconstruction measurements , enhancing the combined signal .    for obvious reasons ,",
    "the method works best where there is a strong correlation between 3d and angular clustering measurements , so it will provide a more significant improvement for thinner redshift shells .",
    "thus , if photometric redshifts were provided for all target galaxies in the sample , including those with spectroscopic redshifts , these could be used to split the sample into thinner redshift shells before applying the angular upweighting .",
    "it would be possible to work with shells in photo - z , or using an interpolation scheme across redshift .",
    "this would enhance the efficiency of the weights .",
