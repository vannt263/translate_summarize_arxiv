    "the behavior of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting fermi system ( luttinger liquid ) in the presence of a single impurity has been the subject of an intensive theoretical and numerical investigation in recent years , for its interesting anomalies with respect to higher dimensions , and its implications to a variety of physical problems as for instance the behavior of quantum wires ( see e.g. refs . ) or the tunneling through a constriction in the fractional quantum hall regime@xcite . specifically , if the interaction is repulsive , the electrons at low energies feel the impurity potential as if it were effectively infinite . on the contrary , for attractive interactions , the effective scattering close to the fermi energy is vanishingly small ( see e.g. ref . ) . in their seminal paper ,",
    "kane and fisher argued that the low energy behavior for repulsive interaction in fact corresponds to a chain disconnected at the impurity site . in the renormalization group language of boundary conformal field theory ( cft ) ( see e.g. refs . ) , for repulsive interaction the open boundary condition ( obc ) is the stable fixed point while the periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) is unstable , and oppositely for attractive interaction ( except for the presence of nontrivial fixed points for spinning electrons with spin anisotropic interaction ) .",
    "cft provides the low energy spectrum and the scaling exponents both for the approach to the appropriate stable fixed point and for the departure from the unstable one .    for a half - filled luttinger liquid",
    ", these predictions have been numerically verified . in the present work , we study numerically the non - half - filled system , which is the generic situation for realistic systems . compared with the half - filled case , the non - half - filled one has non - zero forward scattering phase shift at the fermi surface , which makes the analysis more cumbersome . in spite of that , we show that , also away from half - filling , the correct fixed point boundary conditions are those predicted in refs ..    at the end we will discuss in detail the boundary conditions in relation to some previous studies@xcite which gave results different from those mentioned above .",
    "we study numerically the @xmath0 xxz heisenberg chains with anisotropy @xmath1 at magnetization per site @xmath2 , which correspond to quarter - filled luttinger liquids with repulsive ( @xmath3 ) or attractive interaction ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we model the impurity by modifying the strength of a particular bond , scaling it by a factor @xmath5 . specifically , we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath6 \\\\    &    &   \\mbox { } + b \\left[(s_{1}^+s_{l}^-+s_{1}^-s_{l}^+)/2                               + a s_{1}^zs_{l}^z \\right ] ,   \\end{array } \\label{old1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spin raising and lowering operators at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 being its z - component .",
    "@xmath11 is the chain length . @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to what we will define as _ ideal _ obc and pbc , respectively .",
    "we use the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite to calculate the low energy spectrum and overlaps between ground state wave functions . to ensure the correct magnetization @xmath2 , we insert four sites at each step of dmrg iteration .",
    "we run dmrg for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the optimal number of states which are kept is 300 and the truncation errors are less than @xmath17 . like our previous dmrg calculation for magnetization @xmath18 , we calculate the lowest energy states with parity even and odd ( with respect to the modified bond ) , and @xmath19 component of total spin @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath2 .",
    "we denote these energies in increasing order as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . for states with magnetization @xmath26",
    ", @xmath22 corresponds to the ground state energy while @xmath24 corresponds to the energy of the lowest excited state with different parity . @xmath23 and @xmath25 correspond to states with @xmath27 , but with different parity .",
    "in addition to these low energy levels , we calculate also the ground state wave function overlaps between pbc chains ( @xmath13 ) and impurity chains ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the spin chain at non - zero m and with a modified bond can be written in terms of a boson field , @xmath29 , which is defined periodically : @xmath30 , and of its conjugate momentum @xmath31 .",
    "a detailed derivation is given in ref .",
    "for the case @xmath18 .",
    "here we just point out the differences that occur for non - zero @xmath26 .",
    "the compactification radius , @xmath32 , and the spin - wave velocity , @xmath33 , depend both on @xmath34 and on m. their values for @xmath14 and @xmath2 are given in table i. the effective hamiltonian is : @xmath35            -\\delta ( x)\\left[v_f { d\\phi \\over dx}+           v_b \\cos \\left({\\phi \\over   r}\\right)\\right ] .",

    "the @xmath37 term is allowed , and therefore expected to occur , whenever @xmath39 symmetry as well as translational invariance are broken , which is the case for @xmath40 and with a modified bond .",
    "specifically , @xmath37 and @xmath38 correspond to forward and backward scattering in the luttinger liquid , respectively .",
    "forward scattering is marginal but backward scattering is relevant ( irrelevant ) for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .    in cases where backscattering is irrelevant , which we define generically as pbc cases ( not to be confused with ideal pbc with @xmath13 )",
    ", @xmath37 induces a discontinuity in @xmath29 at the impurity site , @xmath43 modulus @xmath44 .",

    "here we have included the zero point energy @xmath53 which was ignored in ref . .",
    "this formula differs slightly from the one in ref . because in that case spinless fermions were considered rather than @xmath0 spins .",
    "while the models are identical under the jordan - wigner transformation , pbc on the spins _ do not _ correspond to pbc on the fermions .    when the backscattering term is relevant , @xmath54 gets pinned . in analogy with the previous case",

    "pinning forces @xmath60 in the mode expansion , changes the wavefunctions of the harmonic modes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 and reduces the zero point energy by a factor of 1/4 .",

    "the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath52 , on the other hand , depend on the boundary conditions , as well as the @xmath66 and @xmath67 terms .",
    "the latter can be calculated by elementary methods for the xx spin chain with pbc or obc , respectively .",
    "they have also been calculated , using the bethe ansatz for the general xxz model .",
    "they follow more generally from conformal invariance.@xcite note that forward scattering always introduces a discontinuity in @xmath29 at the origin , with or without pinning of @xmath29 depending on whether or not backscattering is relevant .",
    "however , we expect the value of the discontinuity @xmath68 to depend on whether or not pinning occurs .",
    "the effect of a parity transformation on the various eigenstates were worked out in ref . .",
    "in the periodic case it takes @xmath69 , @xmath70 and multiplies wavefunctions by @xmath71 . in the case of obc",
    "it multiples wavefunctions by @xmath72 and transform a bosonic operator @xmath73 , corresponding to an excitation with wave function @xmath74 , into @xmath75 .",
    "we are now in position to work out the quantum numbers and energies of the four lowest energy states .",
    "consider first the states with @xmath20 .",
    "these states have @xmath76 .",
    "the ground state has all other quantum numbers @xmath77 as well .",
    "for pbc , a state of reversed parity can be obtained either by taking @xmath78 ( and all other quantum numbers 0 ) in eq .",
    "( [ fss1 ] ) or by taking an odd parity linear combination of the states with @xmath79 or @xmath80 ( and all other quantum numbers 0 ) .",
    "these two states have energies measured from the ground state energy of @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "thus which of these states has lower energy depends on whether @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "we see from table i that the first one has lower energy for @xmath85 , while the second one has lower energy for @xmath86 .",
    "the states with @xmath27 have @xmath87 .",
    "the state with all other quantum numbers 0 has reversed parity relative to the grounds state . for pbc the state with the same parity as the ground state",
    "is obtained again by choosing @xmath78 ( for @xmath83 ) or either @xmath88 or @xmath89 ( for @xmath84 ) . for obc ,",
    "the lowest energy states for given @xmath90 ( i.e. @xmath91 ) are obtained by choosing all the @xmath92 , while the parity reversed lowest energy states are obtained by choosing @xmath93 .",
    "we define new quantities , @xmath94 , by writing the @xmath95 term in the energy as @xmath96 for pbc or obc .",
    "the values of the @xmath94 for the first four states for ideal pbc and obc for @xmath14 are given in table ii .",
    "the renormalization group flow in the vicinity of the pbc and obc fixed points are determined by the permitted boundary operator , @xmath97 , of lowest scaling dimension , @xmath98 . depending on whether this dimension obeys @xmath99 or @xmath100 ,",
    "the fixed point will be unstable or stable .",
    "we may calculate the ( size dependent ) corrections to the energies , in the vicinity of the fixed point , by doing lowest order perturbation theory in this operator.@xcite the dimensions of a boundary operator at the pbc and obc fixed points can be read off from the finite size energies . specifically , if a boundary operator modifies some quantum numbers , its dimension is simply given by the term inside the square brackets of eq .",
    "( [ fss1 ] ) for pbc and ( [ fss2 ] ) for obc with the appropriate change of quantum numbers , minus the analogous term with the ground state quantum numbers .",
    "for instance , the leading boundary operator which can be defined at the pbc fixed point is the backscattering potential @xmath101 [ see the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) ] .",
    "since it changes @xmath47 by @xmath102 , its scaling dimension is simply @xmath103 .",
    "the lowest order perturbative calculation is quite different depending on whether @xmath83 or @xmath104 .",
    "let us denote @xmath105 and @xmath106 the states corresponding to the energy levels @xmath22 and @xmath24 previously introduced , and use @xmath107 and @xmath108 defined in eq.([fss ] ) . if @xmath83 , then @xmath97 is relevant and the pbc fixed point is unstable . in this case",
    "the correction to @xmath109 becomes larger than the fixed point value , at sufficiently large @xmath11 .",
    "since the state @xmath106 has @xmath78 , and @xmath47 corresponds to a conserved quantum number at the pbc fixed point , the only non - zero matrix element of @xmath110 in the subspace of @xmath105 and @xmath106 is an off - diagonal one @xmath111 . since this is larger than the diagonal matrix elements , the energy difference , divided by @xmath11 , scales as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the renormalization group eigenvalue of the associated coupling constant , @xmath114 . on the other hand , for @xmath84 ,",
    "the pbc fixed point is stable , and in fact the corrections to the @xmath94 s from @xmath97 vanish at large @xmath11 . in this case",
    ", the state @xmath106 has @xmath60 ( and @xmath88 or @xmath89 ) .",
    "hence the first order corrections to the energies vanish and the leading corrections are second order , that is @xmath115 .    at the obc fixed point , the most relevant permitted operator is a product of the operators which change @xmath116 from the two sides of the broken chain , that is @xmath117 .",
    "the @xmath118 operator has dimension @xmath119 .",
    "since the two sides of the broken chain are decoupled at the ideal obc fixed point , the dimension of the product of operators on the two sides is simply additive , giving a total dimension for the leading operator of @xmath120 .",
    "since there is no extra conserved quantum number at the obc fixed point we expect this operator to have a non - vanishing expectation value in the states @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "hence the correction to @xmath109 should scale as @xmath121 .",
    "exactly at @xmath12 or @xmath36 , the set of allowed operators is reduced . for the pbc case , @xmath13 ,",
    "all local as well as @xmath122 operators are forbidden by translation invariance .",
    "the leading irrelevant operators correspond to @xmath123 of dimension 2 .",
    "[ @xmath124 can be eliminated by a redefinition of @xmath29 . ]",
    "these dimension 2 operators are forbidden by symmetry for @xmath18 and so did not appear in .",
    "they contribute @xmath125 corrections to the energies . for the @xmath12 case ,",
    "since translational symmetry is broken , we can construct boundary operators but only at one side or the other of the broken link ; we can not take a product of operators on both sides as above .",
    "in addition , spin rotational invariance forbids all operators with @xmath126 .",
    "again @xmath124 is eliminated by a redefinition of @xmath29 , so the leading irrelevant boundary operator is @xmath127 of dimension 2 .",
    "this also contributes @xmath125 corrections to the energies .",
    "when @xmath5 is close to 0 or 1 , we obtain analytic @xmath125 finite - size corrections , as just discussed , with coefficients of @xmath128 , as well as non - analytic finite size corrections , as previously shown , with coefficients that vanish in the limit @xmath129 or 1 .",

    "accuracy to six digits can be achieved within minutes on an ibm rs6000 workstation . on the other hand",
    ", it would be difficult to calculate other quantities , for example orthogonality exponent , directly from bethe ansatz .    by fitting all four @xmath152 s obtained from dmrg according to eqs .",

    "we also determined , from dmrg , the non - zero forward scattering phase shift , @xmath52 , for the case of obc , as shown in table i.    with these parameters , we have found that the finite - size corrections to the energies , @xmath94 , found numerically agree with the low energy spectrum predicted by cft for pbc and obc and listed in table ii .",

    "the quality of these fittings confirms the prediction that only analytic finite size corrections exist in the cases with @xmath12 or 1 .",
    "after having verified the low energy cft spectrum , we confirm another prediction , namely that the orthogonality exponent between the ground states of two models described by the same hamiltonian but different conformally invariant boundary conditions , is equal to the difference between their corresponding @xmath107 s .",

    "3 we plot @xmath163 , the exponent of the overlap between the _ ideal _ obc and pbc ground state wavefunctions , and the _ ideal _ obc @xmath164 , vs. @xmath95 . up to the two significant digits the extrapolated @xmath154 and @xmath107 are equal for @xmath159 limit , for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we point out here that the low energy spectrum in table ii holds also if the magnetization @xmath18 , as it was shown in ref .. for generic impurity strength , it was shown in that reference that the @xmath18 system flows either to obc ( @xmath165 ) or to pbc ( @xmath166 ) , by a detailed analysis of the size dependence of the low energy levels and by calculating the orthogonality exponent . since the non - universal forward scattering phase shift @xmath167 for @xmath18 ,",
    "universality is recovered and all systems flowing to the obc fixed point had an extrapolated @xmath168 , in agreement with cft prediction .",
    "moreover , @xmath169 was also shown to be equal to the orthogonality exponent of the overlap between the ground states with pbc in the presence and in the absence of the impurity .",
    "analogously , in the following , we will first show that the low energy spectrum for @xmath2 systems does flow to the pbc or obc fixed points , depending on the sign of the interaction .",
    "then we will show the qualitative agreement between @xmath163 and @xmath164 for arbitrary impurity strength @xmath5 at finite size .",
    "we start by showing how the low energy spectrum flows away from pbc towards the obc fixed point for @xmath3 and vice versa for @xmath4 .",
    "we previously said that @xmath52 is not a universal property .",
    "this implies that , if a system flows to one of the two fixed points , it does not mean necessarily that the value of @xmath52 will be exactly the same as that of a chain with @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( as given in table i ) .",

    "for the four energy levels we decided to calculate numerically , @xmath174 always holds , as seen from table ii .",
    "notice that the forward scattering phase shift @xmath52 generated by the impurity contributes to @xmath175 ( and also @xmath176 ) .",
    "in order to simplify the analysis , we will concentrate only on @xmath177 ( @xmath178 @xmath109 ) , which instead depends on the universal properties identifying each fixed point .",
    "let us denote @xmath179 .",
    "then , for small deviations of @xmath5 away from one of the two fixed point values @xmath180 , the following scaling should hold @xmath181 these exponents can be obtained by calculating the first non - vanishing correction to @xmath182 , within a perturbation expansion in @xmath183 , following the prescriptions given in the previous section .",
    "the predicted @xmath184 s are listed in table iv . in fig.4 , for @xmath14 , we plot @xmath185 vs. @xmath186 .",
    "the extrapolated scaling exponents @xmath184 in the figure agree with those listed in table iv , up to the two significant digits .",
    "these results have a very simple interpretation . if @xmath187 , the deviation from the fixed point is not a relevant perturbation and the system flows back to the @xmath188-fixed point , which is therefore stable . on the contrary , if @xmath189 , the perturbative correction blows up as @xmath159 , which implies that the system flows away from the @xmath188 fixed point , which is therefore unstable . again ,",
    "our results demonstrate that , for repulsive interactions , the stable fixed point boundary condition is the obc , and vice versa for attractive interaction .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath182 for arbitrary deviations @xmath183 , namely for @xmath190 . to analyze the data",
    ", we made a very simple scaling ansatz in order just to reproduce the correct scaling behavior close to the obc fixed point .",
    "specifically , @xmath182 is plotted in fig.5 vs. @xmath191 / \\pi$ ] for @xmath3 , and in fig.6 vs. @xmath192 / \\pi$ ] for @xmath4 .",
    "the arrows in the figures show towards which fixed point the system flows as the chain length @xmath11 increases .",
    "we see qualitatively how the excitation energy flows between obc and pbc fixed points .",
    "the proposed scaling is @xmath193 $ ] @xmath194 @xmath195 .",
    "surprisingly , our scaling ansatz , which is in principle valid only close to @xmath12 and @xmath196 being small , seems to give a good description of the data for a wide range of @xmath5 s . for @xmath197",
    ", we have the scaling relation : @xmath198    finally we compare the orthogonality exponent @xmath163 of the overlap between the ground state with pbc and in the presence of the impurity , and the ground state with pbc but in the absence of the impurity . according to cft ,",
    "this exponent should also be equal to @xmath107 for chain with impurity .",
    "we plot @xmath163 and @xmath164 vs. the same variables as used above for @xmath199 .",

    "they show that @xmath163 and @xmath164 are of similar magnitude and have similar flows for various chain lengths and impurity strengths .",
    "again , an important remark is needed regarding the forward scattering phase shift . since we can not exclude its generation at the fixed point , this would imply , for instance , that the orthogonality exponent for attractive interaction is , in general , non - zero . with long enough chains it should be possible to determine @xmath170 and check that both @xmath200 and @xmath164 extrapolate to the same numbers , determined by these phase shifts . however , with the limited lengths available ( @xmath201 ) we have not found it possible to do this .",
    "this is presumably due to the unknown value of the phase shift , the slow convergence of the finite - size corrections due to the small exponent in the non - analytic corrections @xmath202 for @xmath3 ) and the relatively large coefficient in the analytic corrections .",
    "the situation appeared somewhat better in the @xmath18 case .",
    "with periodic boundary conditions , the boson may be written in terms of decoupled left and right - moving parts : @xmath203 the dual field is defined as @xmath204 .",
    "the boundary condition , @xmath205 couples left movers to right movers , separately on both sides of the origin : @xmath206 on the other hand the fields on opposite sides of the origin are not coupled by the boundary condition .",
    "this means that an incoming excitation at @xmath207 is reflected , with unit probability with a phase shift proportional to @xmath208 and similarly for an incoming excitation at @xmath209 .",
    "this boundary condition is the same as the one used in ref . where a different basis was used .",
    "this coupling of left and right movers by relevant backscattering changes green s functions . to illustrate this",

    "one term in the bosonized representation of @xmath211 is : @xmath212 the green s function , with pbc factorizes into separate green s functions for left and right movers , giving : @xmath213 on the other hand , with the perfectly reflecting boundary condition , this correlation function equals 0 if @xmath98 and @xmath214 are on opposite sides of the origin . to calculate the green s function when they are on the same side ( say @xmath215 ) we use a standard device from boundary cft.@xcite we can regard the second boundary condition of eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) as defining @xmath216 for all @xmath209 as the analytic continuation of @xmath217 to the negative @xmath98-axis : @xmath218 the reason this works is because the boundary condition is true at all @xmath219 and @xmath217 and @xmath216 only depend on the variables @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that this analytically continued @xmath217 is _ not _ the original @xmath217 at @xmath207 which is completely decorrelated from the fields at @xmath209 .",
    "using this approach , @xmath222 becomes bilocal : @xmath223 instead of getting a product of 2-point green s functions for left and right moving fields , we now obtain a 4-point green s function for left - movers only , giving : @xmath224 in the limit , @xmath225 , @xmath226 giving:@xmath227 which is the limiting behaviour of eq .",

    "note that without pinning : @xmath229 thus pinning increases the exponent by a factor of 2 . perhaps surprisingly , pinning @xmath54 changes correlation functions involving @xmath230 .",
    "this effect ultimately arises because @xmath29 and @xmath230 can not be regarded as being independent .",

    "in summary , this paper studies the effects of an impurity in a non - half - filled 1d luttinger liquid .",
    "our numerical study for the low energy spectrum confirms previous results .",
    "that is , we show that the low energy spectrum of a chain with an impurity flows to the spectrum of a chain with pbc if the interaction is attractive , and to the spectrum of a chain with obc if the interaction is repulsive .",
    "the behavior of a non - half - filled system is shown to be the same as that of a half - filled one and the presence of particle - hole symmetry is not essential for this behaviour .",
    "therefore , we numerically confirm that the properties of a generic 1d luttinger liquid with an impurity are indeed those predicted by kane and fisher .    the dmrg calculation was completed on ibm risc-6000 at international center for theoretical physics , trieste .",
