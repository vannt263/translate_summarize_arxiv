    "in this talk we discuss the current status of theory vs experiment for @xmath0 and the implications for new physics .",
    "recently a reevaluation of the light by light hadronic contribution to @xmath1 has resulted in a change in the sign of this contribution reducing the difference between the bnl experimental result and the standard model prediction from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . in view of this change",
    "we reconsider the implications for supersymmetry .",
    "we carry out the analysis using a @xmath4 and a @xmath5 error corridor around the central value of the difference between experiment and theory . for the @xmath4 analysis",
    "we find that the upper limits on sparticle masses remain unchanged from those predicted with the @xmath2 difference between experiment and the standard model result with a @xmath6 error corridor . for the @xmath5 analysis",
    "we find that the upper limits are substantially increased from the old analysis and the upper limits of the sparticle masses may lie on the borderline or beyond of what is accessible at the large hadron collider .",
    "an important result that arises from the brookhaven experiment is that the sign of the @xmath7 parameter is determined to be positive for a broad class of supersymmetric models .",
    "however , it is known that yukawa coupling unification typically prefers a negative @xmath7 .",
    "we discuss a possible way out of this problem using nonuniversality of gaugino masses .",
    "finally we consider the implications of the brookhaven result for neutralino relic density and for the direct detection of supersymmetric dark matter in dark matter detectors .",
    "over the last three months the theoretical prediction of @xmath1 in the standard model has undergone a significant revision because of the change in sign of the light by light ( lbl ) hadronic correction to @xmath1 .",
    "thus the previous average for @xmath9 was@xcite @xmath10 .",
    "however , recent reevaluations@xcite give a @xmath9 opposite in sign to the previous evaluations .",
    "the reevaluations are summarized in table 1 .",
    "authors & @xmath9 + knecht @xcite & @xmath11 + hayakawa & kinoshita@xcite & @xmath12 + bijnens @xcite & @xmath13 + blockland @xcite ( @xmath14 ) & @xmath15 +    now with the old value of the lbl hadronic correction the total standard model prediction of @xmath16 was @xmath17 . using the bnl experimental result@xcite of @xmath18 one finds @xmath19 which gives the old @xmath2 deviation between experiment and the standard model .",
    "however , taking an average of the top three entries in table 1 for @xmath9 the revised difference between experiment and the standard model is @xmath20 which is now only a @xmath21 deviation between experiment and the standard model prediction .",
    "[ more recently another evaluation of @xmath9 based on chiral perturbation theory has been given in ref.@xcite which gives @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for unknown low energy constants arising from subleading contributions .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite view a @xmath23 range of @xmath24 to 3 or even larger as not unreasonable .",
    "the result of eq.(1 ) corresponds essentially to a @xmath25 and a much larger value will significantly affect eq.(1 ) and the conclusions resulting from it . ] aside from the issue of lbl hadronic correction , the remaining part of the hadronic correction contains @xmath26 and @xmath27 vacuum polarization corrections . in the deduction of eq.(1 )",
    "we used the evaluation of ref.@xcite for the @xmath26 correction .",
    "however , there is considerable amount of controversy regarding these corrections and this issue is still under scrutiny@xcite .",
    "if indeed there is discrepancy between experiment and the standard model prediction of @xmath1 then it would have important implications for new physics .",
    "such new physics could be supersymmetry , compact extra dimensions , muon compositeness , techni - color , anomalous w couplings , new gauge bosons , lepto - quarks , or radiative muon masses@xcite .",
    "we focus here on supersymmetric models and specifically on supergravity models@xcite which arise from gravity mediated breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "the soft susy breaking sector of the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) is defined by four parameters : these consist of the universal scalar mass @xmath28 , the universal gaugino mass @xmath29 , the universal trilinear coupling @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 gives mass to the up quark and @xmath33 gives mass to the down quarks and the leptons .",
    "we will use sugra models as a benchmark and similar analyses can be carried out in other models such as those based on gauge mediation and anomaly mediation breaking mechanisms of supersymmetry .",
    "we begin by discussing the basic one loop contribution to @xmath34 in supersymmetry@xcite . here",
    "the basic contributions are from the chargino @xmath35 and neutralino @xmath36 ( i=1,.,4 ) exchange . for the cp conserving case",
    "the chargino contribution is the largest and here one has @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the left(right ) chiral amplitudes and are defined by @xmath39 and where @xmath40 are the mixing angles and @xmath41 are form factors . recently , the absolute signs of the supersymmetric contribution was checked by taking the supersymmetric limit@xcite .",
    "there are some interesting features of the susy contribution .",
    "one finds that since @xmath42 one has@xcite @xmath43 .",
    "further , it is easy to show that the sign of @xmath44 is correlated with the sign of @xmath7@xcite .",
    "thus one finds that @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 where we use the sign convention of ref.@xcite .",
    "[ [ upper - limits - on - sparticle - masses ] ] upper limits on sparticle masses + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    soon after the bnl result became available@xcite a large number of analyses appeared in the literatures exploring the implications of the results for new physics@xcite . these analyses were based on the result @xmath49 which as is now realized is based on using the wrong sign of the light by light hadronic correction . using the above result and a the 2@xmath50 error corridor so that @xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 the bnl data leads to the following sparticle mass limits in msugra@xcite : @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "since the lhc can explore squarks / gluinos up to 2 tev the bnl result implies that sparticles should become visible at the lhc@xcite",
    ".     plane corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 constraints from @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the top left gray region does not satisfy the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking requirement while the bottom patterned region near the higher @xmath29 side and on the border of the white allowed regions is discarded either because of stau or the cp - odd higgs boson turning tachyonic at the tree level ( from ref.@xcite ) . ]",
    "next we assess the situation as a consequence of the change in the sign of the light by light hadronic correction which results in eq.(1 ) . in this case",
    "a @xmath6 error corridor would not lead to upper limits for the sparticle masses .",
    "however , one can get interesting constraints if one imposes a @xmath4 or a @xmath5 constraint .",
    "a @xmath4 constraint actually yields exactly the same upper limits as before so in this case the analysis of ref.@xcite remains valid as far as the upper limits are concerned .",
    "the case of @xmath5 was analyzed in ref.@xcite and it was found , as expected , that the upper limits go up considerably . in fig.(1 ) results are presented for the case of @xmath57 . here",
    "one finds that the upper limits on @xmath28 and @xmath58 are considerably larger than for the analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "specifically one finds from fig.(1 ) that the upper limit on @xmath28 in the range of the parameter space exhibited already exceeds 2.5 tev which is on the borderline of the reach of the lhc .",
    "the upper limits for other values of @xmath59 are sharply dependent on the value of @xmath59 .",
    "a more complete analysis of the constraint for the @xmath5 case can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "another interesting implication of the bnl result is that under the assumption of cp conservation and setting @xmath60@xmath61 the bnl data determines @xmath62 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it known that @xmath46 is favored by the @xmath63 constraint@xcite and also favored for dark matter searches .",
    "the implications of @xmath46 for dark matter will be discussed in further detail below .",
    "one issue of concern relates to the possibility that the supersymmetric effects may be masked by effects arising from low lying extra dimensions .",
    "this possibility was examined in ref.@xcite in a model with one large extra dimension compactified on @xmath64 with radius r ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the extra dimension contributes to the fermi constant and by a comparison of the standard model prediction with the experimental value of the fermi constant@xcite one can place a limit on the extra dimension of about @xmath66 tev . with this size value of @xmath67 one",
    "finds that the contribution of the extra dimension to @xmath1 is negligible@xcite compared to the supersymmetric contribution . for the case of strong gravity",
    "the effect on @xmath1 from the kaluza - klein excitations of the graviton in the case d=2 is also small@xcite since here the fundamental planck scale @xmath68 is found to have a lower limit of @xmath69 tev from the recent gravity experiment@xcite .",
    "the above exhibits the fact that @xmath8 is not an efficient probe of extra dimensions .",
    "other techniques such as energetic dileptonic signals at lhc would be more efficient signals for the exploration of extra dimensions@xcite .",
    "an important effect that can modify the supersymmetric contribution is the effect of cp violating phases .",
    "this topic has been analyzed in several works@xcite .",
    "specifically it is found that the bnl data can be used to constrain the cp phases and strong constraint on the phases are found to exist@xcite .",
    "[ [ positivity - of - mu - and - yukawa - unification ] ] positivity of @xmath7 and yukawa unification + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we discuss now another aspect of the @xmath34 constraint and this concerns yukawa unification in supersymmetric models .",
    "it has been known for some time that @xmath70 yukawa coupling unification typically prefers a negative @xmath7@xcite .",
    "thus the positively of the @xmath7 sign implied by the bnl data appears a priori to pose a problem for yukawa unification .",
    "now the reason why yukawa unification typically prefers a negative @xmath7 is easily understood from the fact that such unification requires a negative supersymmetric correction to the b quark mass and a negative correction to the b quark mass is easily obtained when @xmath7 is negative . to illustrate this phenomenon we consider the gluino and chargino exchanges which contribute the largest supersymmetric correction to the b quark mass .",
    "thus one has@xcite @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "generally the gluino exchange contribution tends to be the larger one and here one finds that for a positive @xmath75 which is typically the case a negative @xmath7 indeed leads to a negative correction to the b quark mass which in turn leads to the usual result that @xmath70 unification prefers a negative @xmath7 .     vs @xmath76 , the susy correction to @xmath77 , for the 24-plet case , when @xmath78 , @xmath79 tev , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath46 , where @xmath82 is as defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dots refer to @xmath70 unification at the shown level and filled squares additionally represent points which satisfy both the @xmath83 and the muon @xmath84 constraints ( from ref.@xcite ) . ]",
    "there are several solutions discussed recently to overcome this problem@xcite .",
    "one simple possibility discussed in refs.@xcite is that of nonuniversal gaugino masses where the sign of the gluino mass is negative relative to the mass of the su(2 ) gaugino mass . in this case one can obtain a negative contribution to the b quark mass while maintaining a positive @xmath7 .",
    "the basic idea is that with nonuniversalities one can have the sign of @xmath85 and @xmath86 gauginos to be opposite .",
    "a positive positive @xmath7 and a positive @xmath87 are consistent with the bnl data , while a positive @xmath7 and a negative @xmath88 gives a negative correction to the b qaurk mass and leads to @xmath70 unification .",
    "we considered two classes of models , one based on su(5 ) and the other on so(10 ) .",
    "for the su(5 ) case one has that the the gaugino mass matrix can transform like the symmetric product of @xmath89 which has the expansion of @xmath90 . in this case",
    "the gaugino masses arising from the 24 plet has the opposite sign between the su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauginos@xcite .",
    "thus one can choose @xmath7 positive and the gluino mass to be negative which gives a negative contribution to the b quark mass and allows for the satisfaction of the @xmath70 unification constraints .",
    "the degree of unification defined by @xmath91 vs the correction to the b quark mass is exhibited in fig.(2 ) for the 24 plet case with a positive @xmath7 sign .",
    "one finds that @xmath92 unification can be satisfied to a high degree of accuracy with an appropriate negative correction @xmath76 to the b quark mass .",
    "a similar analysis holds for the so(10 ) case . here",
    "the gaugino mass matrix can transform like symmetric product of @xmath93 which has the expansion of @xmath94 . here for the case when the symmetry breaking occurs pattern is of the form @xmath95@xmath96 @xmath97 one finds that the @xmath98 gaugino masses arising from the 54 plet are in the ratio@xcite @xmath99@xmath100 .",
    "however , for the symmetry pattern @xmath101@xmath102 @xmath97 one finds that the @xmath103 , and @xmath104 gaugino masses arising from the 54 plet are in the ratio@xcite @xmath99@xmath105 .",
    "we will call this case @xmath106 .",
    "an analysis similar to that for the 24 plet case can be carried out for the 54 and @xmath106 cases and one finds that @xmath70 unification occurs once again for these cases .",

    "this result has important implications for dark matter .",
    "as already indicated a positive @xmath7 is preferred by the constraint imposed by the flavor changing neutral current process @xmath63@xcite in that the experimental value for this branching ratio imposes severe constraints on the susy parameter space for the negative sign of @xmath7 but imposes much less stringent constraints on the parameter space for a positive value of @xmath7 .",
    "thus a positive @xmath7 is more favorable for supersymmetric dark matter analysis in that it allows for a large amount of the parameter space of the model where relic density constraints can be satisfied along with satisfying the @xmath63 constraint .",
    "furthermore , it also turns out that detection rates for a positive @xmath7 are generally larger than for a negative @xmath7 .",
    "thus after the bnl data became available it was immediately realized that the positive @xmath7 sign indicated by the bnl data was favorable for dark matter searches@xcite .",
    "more detailed analyses were done in several subsequent works and the parameter space of msugra was further constrained from the relic density constraints . now",
    "another way that the bnl data constrains dark matter is through the yukawa unification conditions .",
    "here we discuss the implications of this constraint on dark matter .",
    "as discussed in the section on @xmath70 unification above , one finds that this unification can be achieved with a positive @xmath7 in a variety of ways .",
    "one possibility discussed above arose from nonuniversal gaugino masses .",
    "we discussed two main scenarios for nonuniversalities corresponding to the su(5 ) and so(10 ) cases . for su(5 )",
    "the gaugino mass nonuniversalities arising from the 24 plet case allows a negative contribution to the b quark mass with a positive @xmath7 and leads to regions of the parameter space where @xmath70 unification occurs .",
    "analysis in this region exhibits that all of the spectrum lies within the usual naturalness limits@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate if this region of the parameter space also leads to a satisfaction of the relic density constraint .",
    "we consider a rather liberal corridor here corresponding to the range @xmath107 .",
    "the analysis shows that significant regions of the parameter space exist where these constraints are satisfied .",
    "an analysis of the detection rates in the direct detection of dark matter was also given@xcite .",
    "one finds@xcite that the detection rates lie in a range that can be fully explored in the new generation of experiments currently underway and those which are planned in the future ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the so(10 ) case .",
    "the sparticle masses consistent with the bnl @xmath4 constraint as given by eq.(1 ) , consistant with the @xmath63 constraint and consistent with the relic constraint are given in table 2 for the 24 plet case of su(5 ) and for the 54 and @xmath106 cases of so(10 ) .",

    "similarly the mass ranges of the other sparticle masses of table 2 can be explored in runii of the tevatron via the trileptonic signal@xcite and other techniques@xcite while the full range for most of the spectrum of table 2 can be explored at the lhc@xcite .",
    "there is a significant amount of more data from the 2000 runs and bnl eventually hopes to measure @xmath1 to an accuracy of @xmath118 . on the other hand , reanalyses of the hadronic correction are still underway to pin down further the size of these corrections . if the deviation between the central value of experiment and the standard model prediction persists at the current level but the error is significantly reduced one could still see a possibility of approaching the discovery limit .",
    "needless to say the implications of a sizable deviation between experiment and theory are enormous as forseen in early works@xcite and elucidated further in several subsequent works@xcite .",
