    "the ability to control a physical system at the quantum level has , whenever it was achieved , profoundly influenced physics and many of its applications .",
    "two prominent examples , the development of lasers and their application to cool atomic gases , have allowed to use light as a tool to perform a wide range of tasks and lead to improvements of precision measurements by orders of magnitude . in the last few years , successes in cavity optomechanics have lead to similar control over motional degrees of freedom of mesoscopic and microscopic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "experiments have successfully demonstrated quantum effects involving a single mechanical oscillator  @xcite and theoretical studies point out the suitability of optomechanical systems to observe truly macroscopic non - classical behavior  @xcite . while the vast majority of the experimental results involve a single mechanical mode , typical solid - state resonators exhibit a multitude of resonances over a wide range of frequencies  @xcite . in systems where the mechanical modes consist of the collective motion of a trapped atomic cloud  @xcite",
    "one can engineer non - degenerate optomechanical modes by trapping several clouds in an optical superlattice  @xcite .",
    "numerous non - degenerate mechanical modes are thus a common feature of optomechanical systems , which feature , however , remains largely unexploited to date as most experimental results  @xcite involve nearly degenerate mechanical modes .",
    "while multimode optomechanics has been studied theoretically for specific applications  @xcite , there has been no general formalism to analyze the possibilities of tuning non - degenerate modes into resonance .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide that formalism , including the effects of quantum noise and measurement back - action of the mediating field .",
    "the resulting equations are applicable over the whole range of optomechanical systems , from large scale interferometers for gravitational wave detection  @xcite to oscillations of ultracold atomic clouds  @xcite or optomechanical microcavities  @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction between non - degenerate mechanical modes is suppressed by their frequency difference . together with the typically small optomechanical couplings this prohibits effective multimode physics involving modes with vastly different frequencies .",
    "however , other fields of physics successfully use auxiliary modes to resonantly couple non - degenerate states . in atomic physics , for instance , two laser beams appropriately detuned from a third state can drive a two - photon resonance between two non - degenerate atomic states  @xcite . in non - linear optics ,",
    "two optical fields can be tuned into resonance by an appropriate pump creating a standing wave in a non - linear crystal  @xcite .",
    "the optomechanical analogue of these techniques is an oscillating intensity in a cavity field coupled to two non - degenerate mechanical modes and is the subject of this article .    a time dependent intracavity intensity is created by any anharmonic pump , the simplest example being the field created by two harmonic drives with distinct frequencies .",
    "the resulting cavity field can mediate a resonant coupling irrespective of the frequency difference of the mechanical modes .",
    "recent theoretical studies have applied specific examples of this very effect for specialized applications , such as the cooling of a low - lying mechanical mode  @xcite , mechanical phase - conjugation  @xcite or preparation of non - classical states  @xcite .",
    "the price for resonant mediated interaction between non - degenerate modes is additional decoherence due to the dissipative nature of the mediating field .",
    "the cavity field that provides mechanical coupling also carries information about the mechanical state out of the cavity and this loss of unitarity is necessarily accompanied by noise entering the mechanical system  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we derive a general and complete master equation for the behavior of two non - degenerate mechanical modes interacting via weak coupling to a shared cavity field .",
    "our treatment is complete in the sense that all sources of decoherence , back - action and noise that are a consequence of the mediating field s dissipation are included .",
    "taking these effects into account is crucial for the operation of any optomechanical device at the quantum level and a prerequisite to the observation of non - classical effects .",
    "the resulting equation is general in the sense that we do not assume any specific detuning or rely on the system s being in any particular parameter regime , apart from the weak coupling assumption which is accessible to virtually all optomechanical systems to date  @xcite .",
    "the derivation of our master equation does not rely on the mediating field s being the mode of an electromagnetic resonator . with a few simple modifications it will also describe interactions mediated by bulk - phononic modes  @xcite . similarly it is straightforward to add individual , markovian heat baths for the mechanical oscillators and while we have neglected them for the discussion of the individual couplings , their effect is discussed in the final section .    after deriving the general master equation , we will study the two resonant effective interactions described by the beam splitter hamiltonian @xmath0 and the two - mode parametric amplifier @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the annihilation operator for phonons in oscillator @xmath3 .",
    "the former allows the mapping of a quantum state from one oscillator to the other while the latter leads to non - classical correlations between the two oscillators , akin to parametric down - conversion in quantum optics .",
    "most results obtained in single - mode optomechanics consist of these two hamiltonians resonantly coupling the cavity - mode with the mechanical mode via the matching of mechanical side bands with the cavity resonance .",
    "optomechanical cooling , for instance , is a realization of the beam splitter hamiltonian together with the large dissipation of the electromagnetic field modes , while parametric driving is a realization of the parametric amplifier involving mechanical and electromagnetic modes  @xcite . realizing these couplings between two mechanical modes opens the door to more customized and precise sensing of forces and fields , the application of quantum computation algorithms to mechanical systems  @xcite and the study of macroscopic decoherence  @xcite .    of crucial importance",
    "is the ratio between the strength of the mediated unitary interactions and the decoherence rates due to the mediating field being emitted from the cavity .",
    "this quantity is a measure for the ability of the effective interaction to create or maintain non - classical correlations between the two modes and thus a gauge for the classicality of the interactions  @xcite .",
    "we find that the relationship between unitary coupling strengths and total decoherence rates depends on the system parameters and the detunings of the pumps with respect to the cavity resonance , such that different choices of detunings turn out to be ideal for a given application .",
    "most importantly , we find that even for systems where the cavity emission rate of the mediating field exceeds all of the involved mechanical frequencies there are regimes where the engineered interaction allows non - classical motional states or the transfer of nonclassical states between oscillators .",
