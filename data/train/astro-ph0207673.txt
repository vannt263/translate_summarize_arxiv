    "in early 2001 , the brookhaven ags experiment 821 measured the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath1 with three times higher accuracy than it was previously known @xcite .",
    "their result disagreed with the standard model prediction at greater than 2.6@xmath2 .",
    "however , a sign error in the calculation of the hadronic light - by - light contribution to @xmath3 was discovered , reducing the discrepancy to 1.6@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "recently , the same collaboration has released a result with much improved statistics @xcite , and there is again a discrepancy at the @xmath0 level .",
    "supersymmetric particles can give significant corrections to @xmath3 @xcite , thus the brookhaven measurement is an important constraint on supersymmetric models .",
    "there has been a substantial literature on this topic since the announcement of the discrepancy @xcite , discussing various consequences of the older measurement . in this paper , we update the results of @xcite concerning the implications of the brookhaven data for supersymmetric cold dark matter , assuming that supersymmetry is the only relevant physics outside of the standard model .",
    "there are two significant assumptions in our discussion .",
    "the first is that the standard model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is somewhat disputed , primarily in the hadronic contribution .",
    "this was clearly demonstrated in the sign error discovered in the last year .",
    "the hadronic error is a very significant part of the error budget when comparing the brookhaven results to the standard model .",
    "in fact it has been claimed that the standard model errors have been significantly underestimated @xcite , but this claim has been refuted @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are new evaluations of the hadronic vacuum polarization from firstly @xmath4 indicating a larger discrepancy @xmath5 and secondly hadronic tau lepton decays indicating a smaller discrepancy @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the second caveat is that supersymmetry is only one of many possible scenarios providing corrections to @xmath3 at the weak scale .",
    "theoretical prejudice tends to favor supersymmetry , but other possibilities exist , summarized in ref .",
    "in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the lightest of the superpartners ( lsp ) is often the lightest neutralino .",
    "these four states are superpositions of the superpartners of the neutral gauge and higgs bosons , @xmath7 with r - parity conserved , this lightest superpartner is stable . for significant regions of the mssm parameter space ,",
    "the relic density of the stable neutralino is of the order @xmath8 , thus constituting an important ( and perhaps exclusive ) part of the cold dark matter ( for a review see ref .",
    "note that @xmath9 is the neutralino density in units of the critical density and @xmath10 is the present hubble constant in units of @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "large scale structure observations favor @xmath13 and a matter density @xmath14 , of which baryons contribute a small amount @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "cmb anisotropy measurements are consistent with this ( summarized in e.g.@xcite ) , favoring @xmath16 .",
    "we take the range @xmath17 as the cosmologically interesting region , basically a 2@xmath2 constraint .",
    "models where neutralinos are not the only component of dark matter are also allowed , so we separately consider arbitrarily small @xmath18 .",
    "even with very small relic densities , such models may be observable in astrophysical contexts @xcite .",
    "we have explored a phenomenological variation of the mssm with seven free parameters : the higgsino mass parameter @xmath19 , the gaugino mass parameter @xmath20 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath21 , the mass of the @xmath22odd higgs boson @xmath23 , the scalar mass parameter @xmath24 and the trilinear soft susy  breaking parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 for third generation squarks .",
    "all of our parameters are fixed at the electroweak scale .",
    "our framework is more general than the supergravity framework , in that we do not impose gut unification of the scalar masses and trilinear couplings .",
    "in contrast to supergravity , this allows a highly pure higgsino lsp and its consequences , namely a susy spectrum that can be significantly more massive . for simplicity",
    ", we do apply the supergravity constraint on gaugino mass unification , though the relaxation of this constraint would not significantly alter our results . as is typical , we assume r - parity conservation , stabilizing the lightest superpartner .",
    "( these models are described in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    ".the ranges of parameter values used in the mssm scans of refs .",
    "we use approximately 80,000 models not excluded by accelerator constraints or the cosmological relic density bound ( @xmath18 ) before the @xmath3 measurement .",
    "approximately 25,000 of these lie in the cosmologically interesting region ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     to investigate the mssm parameter space , we have used the database of mssm models built in refs .",
    "furthermore , for this work we have made special scans emphasizing large positive supersymmetric corrections to @xmath3 , @xmath28 .",
    "the overall ranges of the seven mssm parameters are given in table  [ tab : scans ] .",
    "the database includes one  loop corrections for the neutralino and chargino masses as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and leading log two  loop radiative corrections for the higgs boson masses as given in ref .",
    "supersymmetric contributions to the precision quantities @xmath3 and the @xmath29 branching ratio are also included .",
    "the database contains the neutralino ",
    "nucleon cross sections and expected detection rates for a variety of neutralino dark matter searches .",
    "crucial for studies of dark matter , the database includes the cosmological relic density of neutralinos @xmath30 , based on calculations in refs .  @xcite considering resonant annihilations , threshold effects , finite widths of unstable particles , all two  body tree ",
    "level annihilation channels of neutralinos , and coannihilation processes between all neutralinos and charginos .",
    "we are in the process of including a complete treatment of sfermion coannihilations @xcite .",
    "recent accelerator constraints are applied to each model in the database .",
    "most important are the lep bounds @xcite on the lightest chargino mass ( chargino and neutralino masses are tightly linked ) @xmath31 and on the lightest higgs boson mass @xmath32 ( which ranges from 91.5112 gev depending on @xmath33 ) and the @xmath34 branching ratio @xcite ( darksusy currently only implements the leading - order calculation @xcite ) .",
    "supersymmetric corrections to @xmath3 are surprisingly large , enhanced relative to typical weak  scale contributions by the parameter @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this fact makes these precision measurements enticing approaches for searching for supersymmetry .",
    "typically , the supersymmetric corrections are given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the typical mass of superpartners .",
    "the new results of brookhaven ags experiment e821 @xcite for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath1 , compared with the predicted standard model value are @xmath37 this indicates a disagreement with the standard model at a @xmath0 confidence level .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , there exist newer and conflicting evaluations of the standard model contribution which increase or decrease the discrepancy significantly .",
    "we will focus on the slightly older evaluation , but we will qualitatively discuss the effects of applying either of the new evaluations . to investigate the implications for the supersymmetric parameter space , we will assume that supersymmetry is the only source of corrections to @xmath3 outside of the standard model . considering a 95% @xmath38 confidence region for the supersymmetric contribution , we accept the following range of @xmath28 @xmath39 we have used the full calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite to compute @xmath28 for the models in the database .",
    "the astrophysical phenomenology of neutralinos depends strongly on the ratio of gaugino and higgsino fractions , defined as @xmath40 we plot this ratio against the neutralino mass for each model in the database in fig .",
    "[ fig : mxzg ] . for clarity",
    ", the models have been binned along both axes . in the left panel ,",
    "we only require that @xmath18 , and on the right we apply the more stringent constraint that the neutralino could make up all of the dark matter , @xmath41 .",
    "models allowed before the new @xmath28 constraint are plotted as crosses , and models respecting the new @xmath28 constraint are plotted as crossed circles .    as has been discussed at length previously @xcite ,",
    "a @xmath28 bound that excludes zero from the positive side gives an upper limit on the mass of the neutralino , in this case 650 gev .",
    "this is a large improvement over the cosmological bound based on the neutralino relic density not being too large , an upper limit of 7 tev @xcite .",
    "however , if the standard model value is included in the allowed region by e.g.  considering a @xmath42 confidence interval or a revised standard model calculation , there is no bound on neutralino mass .",
    "if the more favorable evaluation is considered , the mass bound becomes 450 gev .",
    "if the neutralino has a large enough relic density to make up all of the cold dark matter , another effect appears , namely that the neutralino can not be very purely higgsino - like in composition , requiring at least a 5% mixture ( in quadrature ) of gaugino states . even without requiring neutralino dark matter ,",
    "higgsino - like neutralinos are disfavored , with a maximum purity of 99.9% ( @xmath43 .",
    "orthogonal to the neutralino mass and composition but equally important to the value of @xmath28 are the parameters @xmath33 ( the ratio of vacuum expectation values ) and @xmath44 ( the scalar mass parameter ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbm0 ] we plot these parameters for the database of models , again indicating the effects of the constraint on @xmath28 .",
    "the constraint forces the scalar mass parameter to be small , but the upper bound increases with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "there is a large community pursuing the goal of detecting dark matter particles , neutralinos especially , in various astrophysical contexts .",
    "the possibilities can be broken up along the lines of `` direct '' and `` indirect '' detection .",
    "direct detection means detecting the rare scatterings of neutralinos in our galactic halo with nuclei in a sensitive low background apparatus .",
    "indirect detection means detecting the products of rare annihilations of galactic neutralinos , such as antiprotons , antideuterons , positrons , gamma rays , and neutrinos .",
    "perhaps the most promising of the astrophysical neutralino searches is the direct detection program .",
    "experiments such as cdms @xcite , dama @xcite , and edelweiss @xcite have pushed exclusion limits down to cross sections as small as @xmath45 pb . as has been noted before , the neutralino  nucleon elastic scattering cross section exhibits a significant correlation with @xmath28 @xcite , thus a large positive @xmath28 is exciting for direct searches .",
    "direct detection is promising even in the case where the neutralinos have a small relic density and thus are only a small component of the dark matter . in this case",
    "we perform a conservative rescaling of the galactic neutralino density as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the current upper limit on the relic density . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : directdetect ] , we plot the spin - independent neutralino - proton scattering cross section , rescaled according to eq .",
    "[ eq : rescale ] .",
    "the constraint due to @xmath28 is intriguing , as it bounds the rescaled cross section at around @xmath48 pb . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : directdetect ] , we perform no rescaling , and only consider models with cosmologically interesting relic densities . here",
    "the minimum cross section is around @xmath49 pb . the inlet at 100 gev and @xmath50 pb is due to the lower limit @xmath51 .",
    "these bounds indicate that there is considerable hope for the next generation of experiments , such as cdms ii and cresst ii @xcite .",
    "the latter bound is perhaps reachable by future experiments with one ton target masses such as genius @xcite , cryoarray @xcite , and xenon @xcite .",
    "finally , it is important to note that in the case where the significance of the @xmath3 discrepancy is reduced , the lower bound on the cross section disappears .",
    "however , there is _ not _ an upper bound on the cross section .",
    "large cross sections are still possible with @xmath28 consistent with zero .",
    "neutrino telescopes such as at lake baikal @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , in the mediterranean @xcite , and the south pole @xcite are a promising technique for indirect detection .",
    "neutralinos in the galactic halo scatter into orbits around the earth or sun , and can then rapidly sink to the cores of these bodies by additional scatterings , resulting in a large density enhancement",
    ". this can produce a detectable annihilation signal in neutrinos at high ( gev ) energies .",
    "it is the capture rate that governs the neutrino flux , and is strongly correlated with the neutralino ",
    "nucleon cross section .",
    "this places a lower bound on the detection rate , though at small neutralino mass there are threshold effects that remove it @xcite . to illustrate",
    ", we plot the rate of neutrino - induced through - going muons from the sun along with the unsubtractable background ( from cosmic rays incident on the sun s surface ) in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : indirect ] .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath28 bound cuts away much of the undetectable parameter space , but not all of it . in the top right panel we repeat the calculation for neutrinos from the center of the earth , where the prospects are much less promising .",
    "in addition , neutralinos can annihilate in the galactic halo .",
    "the relevant rates are quite small , but the enormous mass of the halo compensates , and the annihilation products may be detectable .",
    "gamma rays propagate essentially freely , thus the expected rate is largest towards the galactic center where the dark matter density is largest .",
    "charged particles are trapped by the galactic magnetic field and effectively diffuse , so these annihilation products would originate more nearby .",
    "the detection of the gamma ray lines from direct annihilations either to two photons , or to a photon and a @xmath52 boson would be a gold  plated signature of neutralinos in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "gamma ray experiments such as the atmospheric erenkov telescopes ( acts ) veritas @xcite and magic @xcite , and the glast @xcite satellite hope to detect these lines . assuming that the galactic halo is an isothermal sphere with a 1 kpc core , we plot the reach of these experiments in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : indirect ] . note that with this assumption the emission enhancement from around the black hole at the galactic center is insignificant @xcite ,",
    "so we neglect it .",
    "we notice that applying the @xmath28 bound has little effect on the prospects for these experiments .",
    "it appears that the detection of the gamma ray lines is quite difficult .",
    "other assumptions , including clumping of the dark matter or a lack of a central core lead to significantly higher predictions @xcite .",
    "the intensity of cosmic ray positrons @xcite from neutralino annihilation is not much affected by the constraint on @xmath28 .",
    "the final possibility we mention is that antideuterons may be an interesting annihilation product to search for @xcite .",
    "the background from mundane cosmic ray processes should be relatively smaller ( a smaller fraction of the annihilation signal ) at low energies than for antiprotons .",
    "a signal may be detectable in experiments such as ams @xcite and gaps @xcite , as seen in the bottom right of fig .",
    "[ fig : indirect ] .",
    "it is interesting that the @xmath28 constraint eliminates the models with the lowest rates , and furthermore that the whole parameter space is covered for neutralino masses between 100 gev and 500 gev .",
    "separating a signal from the background with antideuterons may be difficult however .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the recent confirmation of a discrepancy with the standard model of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite , updating and expanding the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . assuming that supersymmetry is responsible for the discrepancy",
    ", we have investigated the consequences for astrophysical dark matter searches .",
    "we have confirmed that the constraint significantly improves the prospects for direct detection experiments trying to measure the rare scatterings of galactic neutralinos .",
    "neutrino telescopes are also helped by this result . the prospects for the detection of gamma ray lines from neutralino annihilations at the galactic center are not much affected .",
    "the prospects for detecting cosmic ray antideuterons as neutralino annihilation products are also significantly improved . in all cases ,",
    "if the discrepancy disappears , there remain supersymmetric models with detectable rates for all of these experiments .          m.  knecht and a.  nyffeler , phys .",
