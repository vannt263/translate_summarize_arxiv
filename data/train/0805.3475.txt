    "the question of dark energy and the accelerating universe has been the focus of a large amount of activities in recent years . this expansion has directly been measured from the light - curves of several hundred type ia supernovae @xcite and independently from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the wmap satellite @xcite and other cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "all these results strongly suggest that the universe is permeated smoothly by dark energy which has a negative pressure and violates the strong energy condition .",
    "dark energy and the accelerating universe have been discussed extensively from various point of views over the past few years @xcite . in principle , a natural candidate for dark energy could be a small cosmological constant .",
    "one approach in this direction is to employ what is known as modified gravity where an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar is added to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "it has been shown that such a modification may account for the late time acceleration and the initial inflationary period in the evolution of the universe @xcite .",
    "one of the first proposals in this regard was suggested in @xcite where a term of the form @xmath1 was added to the usual einstein - hilbert action .",
    "however , several models of @xmath0 gravity , proposed in @xcite , have been shown to suffer from unwanted instabilities @xcite or violate solar system constraints @xcite .",
    "these instabilities arise because of an extra propagating scalar degree of freedom , and hence any viable @xmath0 model must be constructed in such a way as to render the dynamics of this scalar field carefully controllable .",
    "this is in principle possible , and indeed @xmath0 theories can be made to satisfy solar system and laboratory tests by invoking the so - called chameleon mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite have tried to resolve the singularity problem arising in the strong gravity regime of the otherwise viable @xmath0 theories by imposing appropriate fine - tuning on their models .    in @xmath0 gravity , einstein equations",
    "posses extra terms induced from geometry which , when moved to the right hand side , may be interpreted as a matter source represented by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 , see equation ( [ eq03 ] ) . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the space - time - matter ( stm ) theory , discussed below , results in einstein equations in @xmath3 with some extra geometrical terms which may be interpret as induced matter .",
    "it therefore seems plausible to make a correspondence between the geometrical terms in stm and @xmath2 resulting in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we shall explore this idea to show that different choices of the parameter @xmath4 in stm may correspond to different choices of @xmath0 in curvature quintessence models in modified gravity .",
    "the correspondence discussed above is based on the idea of extra dimensions .",
    "the idea that our world may have more than four dimensions is due to kaluza @xcite , who unified einstein s theory of general relativity with maxwell s theory of electromagnetism in a @xmath5 manifold .",
    "since then , higher dimensional or kaluza - klein theories of gravity have been studied extensively @xcite from different angles .",
    "notable amongst them is the stm theory mentioned above , proposed by wesson and his collaborators , which is designed to explain the origin of matter in terms of the geometry of the bulk space in which our @xmath3 world is embedded , for reviews see @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in stm theory , our world is a hypersurface embedded in a five - dimensional ricci - flat ( @xmath6 ) manifold where all the matter in our world can be thought of as being manifestations of the geometrical properties of the higher dimensional space .",
    "the fact that such an embedding can be done is supported by campbell s theorem @xcite which states that any analytical solution of the einstein field equations in @xmath7 dimensions can be locally embedded in a ricci - flat manifold in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "since the matter is induced from the extra dimension , this theory is also called the induced matter theory .",
    "applications of the idea of induced matter or induced geometry can also be found in other situations @xcite .",
    "the stm theory allows for the metric components to be dependent on the extra dimension and does not require the extra dimension to be compact .",
    "the sort of cosmologies stemming from stm theory is studied in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the correspondence between @xmath0 gravity and stm theory . in section 2",
    "we present a short review of @xmath3 dark energy models in the framework of @xmath0 gravity . in section 3",
    "the field equations are solved in stm theory by fixing a suitable metric and the resulting geometric terms are interpreted as dark energy .",
    "the cosmological evolution in stm are considered in section 4 .",
    "section 5 deals with an example for a special form of @xmath0 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "to begin with , let us start by a brief review of @xmath0 gravity theory .",
    "we start by writing the four dimensional action as @xmath9 where @xmath0 is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the action for the matter fields .",
    "we use units such that @xmath12 .",
    "the field equations are @xmath13 which can be recast into the more expressive form @xmath14 where an stress - energy tensor has been defined for the curvature contribution @xmath15 + f'(r)^{;\\alpha\\beta}(g_{\\alpha\\mu}g_{\\beta\\nu}-g_{\\alpha\\beta}g_{\\mu\\nu } ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] and @xmath16 is the stress - energy tensor of the matter . to derive the field equations we consider the robertson - walker metric for the evolution of the cosmos @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the curvature of the space , namely , @xmath19 for the flat , closed and open universes respectively . substituting the above metric in equation ( [ eq03 ] )",
    "we obtain the @xmath3 , spatially flat friedmann equations as follows @xmath20 and @xmath21,\\ ] ] where a dot represents derivation with respect to time .",
    "such a universe is dominated by a barotropic perfect fluid with the equation of state ( eos ) given by @xmath22 ( @xmath23 for pressureless cold dark matter and @xmath24 for radiation ) and a spatially homogenous curvature quintessence .",
    "the energy density and pressure of the curvature quintessence are @xmath25 \\right\\},\\ ] ] and @xmath26 -3\\left(\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}\\right)\\dot{r}f''(r ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the equation of state of the curvature quintessence is @xmath27 recently , cosmological observations have indicate that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expanding phase .",
    "this could be due to the vacuum energy or dark energy which dominates our universe against other forms of matter such as dark matter and baryonic matter .",
    "we thus concentrate on the vacuum sector _ i.e. _ @xmath28 , from which the evolution equation of curvature quintessence becomes @xmath29 yielding @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv&\\rho_{0_{\\rm curv } } e(z),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath31 is the redshift and the subscript @xmath32 denotes the current value . in terms of the redshift , the first friedmann equation can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the current values of the dimensionless density parameter and hubble parameter , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq14 ] ) is the friedmann equation in terms of the redshift , @xmath36 , which is suitable for cosmological observations .",
    "in fact , equations ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) , obtained in section 4 , are the cosmological connections between @xmath0 gravity and stm theory .",
    "in the context of stm theory , a class of exact @xmath5 cosmological solutions has been investigated and discussed in @xcite .",
    "this solution was further pursued in @xcite where it was shown to describe a cosmological model with a big bounce as opposed to the ubiquitous big bang .",
    "the @xmath5 metric of this solution reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two arbitrary functions of @xmath42 , @xmath18 is the @xmath43 curvature index @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is a constant .",
    "this solution satisfies the @xmath5 vacuum equation @xmath6 .",
    "the kretschmann curvature scalar @xmath46 shows that @xmath45 determines the curvature of the @xmath5 manifold .",
    "such a solution was considered in @xcite with a different notation .    using the @xmath3 part of the @xmath5 metric ( [ eq15 ] ) to calculate the @xmath3 einstein tensor",
    ", we obtain @xmath47 as was mentioned earlier , since the recent observations show that the universe is currently going through an accelerated expanding phase , we assume that the induced matter contains only dark energy with @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath49 .",
    "we then have @xmath50 @xmath51 from equations ( [ eq19 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) , one obtains the eos of dark energy @xmath52 the hubble and deceleration parameters are given in @xcite and can be written as @xmath53 and @xmath54 from which we see that @xmath55 represents an accelerating universe while @xmath56 represents a decelerating one .",
    "the function @xmath4 therefore plays a crucial role in defining the properties of the universe at late times .",
    "in this section we will concentrate on the predictions of the cosmological evolution in the spatially flat case ( @xmath57 ) . to avoid having to specify the form of the function @xmath58",
    ", we change the parameter @xmath42 to @xmath36 and use @xmath59 and define @xmath60 , noting that @xmath61 .",
    "we then find that equations ( [ eq21])-([eq23 ] ) reduce to @xmath62 and @xmath63 there is an arbitrary function @xmath4 in the present @xmath5 model .",
    "different choices of @xmath4 may correspond to different choices of @xmath0 in curvature quintessence models in modified gravity .",
    "various choices of @xmath4 correspond to the choices of @xmath64 .",
    "this enables us to look for the desired properties of the universe via equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) . using these definitions ,",
    "the friedmann equation becomes @xmath65 this would allow us to use the supernovae observational data to constrain the parameters contained in the model or the function @xmath64 . by comparing equation ( [ eq26 ] ) with equation ( [ eq14 ] ) , we find that there exists a correspondence between the functions @xmath0 and @xmath64 .",
    "we thus take @xmath64 as @xmath66^{-1}.\\label{fz}\\ ] ] according to ( [ eq13 ] ) , it is easy to see that the function @xmath67 is determined by the particular choice of @xmath0 which , in turn , determines the function @xmath64 through equation ( [ eq27 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of the density components and eos of dark energy may now be derived . in the next section",
    "we will consider the correspondence between modified gravity and the ricci - flat cosmology for a generic @xmath0 .",
    "to continue , we must determine the functional form of @xmath0 . thus , for example , we choose @xmath0 as a generic power law of the scalar curvature and assume for the scale factor a power law solution in @xmath3 , investigated in the first reference in @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath68 the interesting cases are for the values of @xmath69 satisfying @xmath70 which would lead to an accelerated expansion of our universe .",
    "let us now concentrate on the case @xmath49 .",
    "inserting equation ( [ eq28 ] ) into the dynamical system ( [ eq07 ] ) and ( [ eq08 ] ) , for a spatially flat space - time we obtain an algebraic system for parameters @xmath71 and @xmath69 @xmath72=0 , \\\\   \\\\",
    "\\alpha\\left[n^{2}-n+1+\\alpha(n-2)\\right]=n(n-1)(2n-1),\\\\ \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    from which the allowed solutions are @xmath73 the solutions with @xmath74 are not interesting since they provide static cosmologies with a non - evolving scale factor .",
    "note that this result matches the standard general relativity result , @xmath75 , in the absence of matter . on the other hand ,",
    "the cases with generic @xmath69 and @xmath71 furnish an entire family of significant cosmological models .",
    "using equations ( [ eq09 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) we can also deduce the equation of state for the family of solutions @xmath76 as @xmath77 where @xmath78 as @xmath79 .",
    "this shows that an _ infinite _",
    "@xmath71 is compatible with recovering an _",
    "infinite _ cosmological constant .",
    "thus , using equation ( [ eq31 ] ) , the functions @xmath67 and @xmath64 are given by @xmath80},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath81}\\right]^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , using the above equations , we see that equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) can be written as @xmath82 and @xmath83 therefore , within the context of the present investigation , the accelerating , dark energy dominated universe can be obtained by using the correspondence between @xmath64 and @xmath0 in modified gravity theories .",
    "we observe that in stm theory , @xmath5 dark energy cosmological models correspond to @xmath3 curvature quintessence models .",
    "this result is consistent with the correspondence between exact solutions in kaluza - klein gravity and scalar tensor theory @xcite .",
    "we also note that , as is well known , with a suitable conformal transformation , @xmath0 gravity reduces to scalar tensor theory .    from equations ( [ eq32 ] ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) , we can rewrite equation ( [ eq26 ] ) as @xmath84},\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and the contribution of ordinary matter has been neglected .",
    "figure 1 shows the behavior of @xmath86 as a function of @xmath71 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "as can be seen , for @xmath89 and @xmath90 we have @xmath91 , that is , the universe finally approaches the curvature dominant state , thus undergoing an accelerated expanding phase .",
    "figure 2 shows the behavior of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath36 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "we see that for small @xmath36 , @xmath95 .",
    "thus , we have obtained late - time accelerating solutions only by using the correspondence between @xmath0 gravity and stm theory . here , we have interpreted the properties of @xmath5 ricci - flat cosmologies by dark energy models in modified gravity .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the present accelerated expanding phase of the universe using a general class of @xmath5 ricci - flat cosmological models .",
    "such an exact solution contains two arbitrary functions , @xmath4 and @xmath58 which are analogous to different forms of @xmath0 in curvature quintessence models .",
    "also , once the forms of the arbitrary functions are specified , the characteristic parameters determining the evolution of our universe are specified .",
    "we have noted that the correspondence between the functions @xmath64 and @xmath0 plays a crucial role and defines the form of the function @xmath64 . finally , by taking a specific form for @xmath0 we obtained solutions that are consistent with late - time acceleration of the universe .",
