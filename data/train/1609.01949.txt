    "anisotropic flow or in particular elliptic flow is one of the key observables used to study the properties of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies .",
    "hydrodynamic model with smooth initial density distribution has been used successfully in recent past to study the bulk properties of matter and it explains the charged particle spectra and elliptic flow simultaneously upto a large value of transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in many interesting recent studies that event - by - event hydrodynamic model with fluctuating initial conditions  @xcite explains the elliptic flow results even for most central collisions of heavy nuclei and also the large triangular flow of hadrons at rhic and lhc energies  @xcite both of which were unexplained earlier by hydrodynamics with smooth initial density distribution .",
    "photons are considered as one of the promising probes to study the properties of quark gluon plasma formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental data from 200a gev au+au collisions at rhic by phenix  @xcite and from 2.76a tev pb+pb collisions at lhc by alice  @xcite have reported excess of direct photon yield over scaled proton - proton collisions . the excess yield in both the cases",
    "is attributed to photon radiation from the thermalized qgp and hot hadronic matter .",
    "thermal photon spectra from hydrodynamic model calculation along with prompt contribution from next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculation found to explain the direct photon spectra well both at rhic and lhc in the range @xmath2 2 gev  @xcite .",
    "photon elliptic flow has the potential to illustrate the hot and dense initial state and its evolution more efficiently compared to hadronic @xmath4 .",
    "direct photon @xmath4 data at rhic  @xcite and lhc  @xcite show similar qualitative nature as predicted by model calculations considering hydrodynamical evolution of the system  @xcite .",
    "however theory results under - estimate the data by a large margin  @xcite .",
    "this is known as the photon @xmath4 puzzle .",
    "many recent studies with viscous hydrodynamics model using event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions as well as studies considering pre - equilibrium flow do not show significant increase in the photon @xmath4 result and still remain unable to explain the data  @xcite .",
    "collisions of uranium ( @xmath5u ) nuclei at @xmath6=193 gev at rhic have gathered a lot of attention recently .",
    "the star experiments at rhic have reported interesting results on particle production as well as azimuthal flow of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "u+u collisions are of special interest due to the non - spherical prolate shape of the colliding nuclei  @xcite and as a result , even the most central collisions can lead to different collision geometry and consequently different values of charged particle multiplicity and anisotropic flow parameters .",
    "recently it has been reported that the most central events in u+u collisions can be identified from the spectator energy deposition at the zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) .",
    "in addition , the multiplicity distribution of elliptic flow along with the zdcs informations can be used to separate different orientations of u+u collisions  @xcite .",
    "we know that photons are emitted throughout the life time of the evolving system and the thermal emission of photons is sensitive to the initial stages of the produced matter .",
    "thus , photon production from different orientations of u+u collisions can provide valuable information about the collision geometry , the hot and dense initial stage of the expanding system and also its evolution .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to know how large is the photon @xmath4 originating from fully overlapping u+u collision and if its comparison with the photon @xmath4 from non - central au+au collisions can help us to understand the photon @xmath4 puzzle .",
    "we calculate thermal photon spectra and differential elliptic flow at rhic for two different orientations , _ tip - tip _ and _ body - body _ which are the limiting cases ( of particle multiplicity ) of fully overlapping u+u collisions . in body - body collisions",
    "the major axes of the two incoming uranium nuclei are perpendicular to the z axis ( beam axis ) whereas for tip - tip collisions the major axes are parallel to the beam direction .",
    "the tip - tip collisions produce a circular overlapping zone on the transverse plane and the body - body collisions lead to an elliptical shape and a larger size of the overlapping zone ( see fig 1 ) . although the number of participants in both these collisions are same , number of binary collisions is about 30% larger for the tip - tip configuration .",
    "the energy density produced is larger and consequently a higher final charged particle multiplicity is observed for tip - tip collisions than for the body - body collisions . however the body - body collisions produce a large @xmath4 because of the initial geometry of the overlapping zone  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the value of the initial spatial anisotropy ( @xmath7 ) for full overlap body - body collision is similar to the @xmath7 calculated for au+au collisions at rhic at an impact parameter @xmath8 7 fm , however , the system produced in au+au collision is about half of the size of system produced in u+u collisions .",
    "thus , the photon spectra and elliptic flow from the different orientations of u+u collisions along with the au+au results at rhic would enrich our understanding of the hot and dense initial state produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we keep our calculations simple by using a hydrodynamical model with smooth initial density distribution .",
    "an event - by - event hydrodynamic model calculation including viscous effect is expected to provide a more accurate estimation of the photon spectra and elliptic flow parameter .",
    "however in the present study we are more interested in showing the qualitative difference in the spectra and @xmath4 resulting from the different orientations of the uranium nuclei in and also the potential of thermal photons from u+u collisions to be used as probe to study the relativistic heavy ion collisions .    in section",
