    "in a series ( @xcite ) of papers , we described and analyzed a simple construction of 3-manifolds from face - pairings .",
    "if @xmath0 is an orientation - reversing edge - pairing on a polygonal disk @xmath2 , then the quotient space @xmath3 is always a surface .",
    "but if @xmath0 is an orientation - reversing face - pairing on a faceted 3-ball @xmath4 , the quotient @xmath5 is not generally a 3-manifold .",
    "( see , for example , section 2.7 of @xcite . ) for the twist construction one chooses a positive integer , called the multiplier , for each edge cycle ( equivalence class of an edge under the action of @xmath0 ) . by subdividing each edge into the product of its multiplier and the size of its edge cycle and then precomposing @xmath0 with a twist ,",
    "one obtains a new faceted 3-ball @xmath6 and orientation - reversing face pairing @xmath7 .",
    "the fundamental result of the constuction is that @xmath8 is always a 3-manifold .",
    "papers @xcite and @xcite give the basic details of the construction . the construction is analyzed further in @xcite , and heegaard diagrams and surgery diagrams are given for twisted face - pairing manifolds .    in this paper",
    "we give a modified construction which we call the bitwist construction .",
    "the basic setup is the same , but we allow the edge cycle multipliers to be positive or negative . allowing twisting in different directions leads to problems in defining the new face - pairing @xmath7 , but one can resolve this by the appropriate insertion of `` stickers '' in the faces of the new faceted 3-ball @xmath6 . in section  [ sec : prelimex ] we give a simple preliminary example to show how stickers are used in the construction .",
    "following this , we give the general construction in section  [ sec : const ] . as with the twist construction ,",
    "the 3-manifolds constructed from the bitwist construction naturally have a cell structure with a single vertex .",
    "one can easily give presentations for fundamental groups of bitwist manifolds as in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) , but the homology results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* secton  6 ) do not generally hold for bitwist manifolds . since @xmath8 has a single vertex ,",
    "some of the results from the twist construction apply directly to the bitwist construction . in particular , the construction of heegaard diagrams and framed surgery descriptions from @xcite are valid for the bitwist construction .",
    "this is developed in section  [ sec : heegaard ] .",
    "if @xmath9 is a corridor complex link for an orientation - reversing face pairing @xmath0 on a faceted 3-ball @xmath4 and @xmath10 is a multiplier function for @xmath11 , then the bitwist manifold @xmath12 is obtained by framed surgery on @xmath9 , where the face components have framing @xmath13 and an edge component has framing the sum of its blackboard framing and the reciprocal of the multiplier of its edge cycle .    after making the leap to negative multipliers ,",
    "it is natural to inquire about multipliers with value 0 . allowing edge cycle multipliers to be 0 amounts to collapsing every edge with multiplier 0 to a point and applying the construction to the resulting complex . in terms of our surgery description ,",
    "this amounts to deleting from our framed link every component with framing @xmath14 , an operation which does not change the resulting manifold .",
    "collapsing edges in general leads to complexes which are no longer 3-balls  they are cactoids . while we actually do find face - pairings on cactoids interesting and we do temporarily allow multipliers to be 0 in the proof of theorem  [ thm : lens ] , for the present we content ourselves with nonzero multipliers .",
    "the framed surgery descriptions are a primary motivation for developing the bitwist construction . in order to realize 3-manifolds as twisted face - pairing manifolds or bitwist manifolds ,",
    "one wants to be able to change the framings of the edge components .",
    "suppose @xmath9 is a corridor complex link for a twisted face - pairing manifold .",
    "we still get a twisted face - pairing manifold if we replace the framing of each edge component by its blackboard framing plus an arbitrary positive rational number . in section  [ sec : framings ] we show that using the bitwist construction , we still get a bitwist manifold if we replace the framing of each edge component by its blackboard framing plus an arbitrary rational number .",
    "this ability to change the signs of the rational numbers gives extra power to the construction . using this , we show in section  [ sec : allarebitwist ] that every closed connected orientable 3-manifold is a bitwist manifold .",
    "we give a preliminary example to indicate the construction .",
    "we start with a simple model face - pairing @xmath0 that was considered in section  2 of @xcite .",

    "we consider @xmath4 as an oriented 3-ball , and for convenience give it an orientation so that in the induced orientation on the boundary of @xmath4 the boundary of each 2-cell is oriented clockwise .",
    "the model face pairing @xmath0 identifies the triangles @xmath18 and @xmath19 by reflection in the common edge @xmath20 , and it identifies @xmath21 and @xmath22 by reflection in the common edge @xmath23 . in the permutation notation of @xcite , @xmath0 is given as follows : @xmath24    . ]",

    "we use the cycle lengths and the absolute values of the multipliers to determine how to subdivide the edges of @xmath4 .",
    "the sign of the multiplier indicates the direction in which we twist edges in the edge cycle @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "if all of the multipliers have the same sign , then we have the twist construction .",

    "we subdivide every edge @xmath39 of @xmath4 into @xmath40 ) \\cdot |{\\textrm{mul}}([e])|$ ] subedges .",
    "we perform these subdivisions so that the face - pairing @xmath0 takes subedges to subedges .",
