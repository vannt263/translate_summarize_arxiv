    "there are two well - known mechanisms for generating tev @xmath0-rays in astrophysical sources  @xcite .",
    "the first involves purely electromagnetic ( em ) processes , including synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering .",
    "the second may be termed hadronic , in which the @xmath0-rays originate in @xmath4 decays .",
    "the latter can in turn be traced to either @xmath5 or @xmath6 collisions .",
    "the em processes originate in the acceleration of electrons ; as a result , the tev @xmath0-rays must be accompanied by an x - ray counterpart . in addition",
    ", the conflicting requirements on the magnetic field ( large field for acceleration , small field for limiting synchrotron cooling ) limits the energy of the emitted photons @xmath7 tev .",
    "the hadronic @xmath6 mode is characterized by a large threshold for @xmath4 production , and thus it is favored only in very hot photon environments , or in the presence of very energetic proton beams . in addition , the presence of the high threshold allows acceleration free of scattering losses as long as the hillas criterion  @xcite holds . in the @xmath5 hadronic mode ,",
    "threshold effects are insignificant . because of this",
    ", it is generally assumed that @xmath4 production occurs in a region distinct from the site of the primary acceleration .",
    "however , one can set conditions relating the interaction length of the nucleons , the neutron decay lifetime and the source confinement radius to permit simultaneous emission of neutrons , @xmath0-rays and neutrinos  @xcite . in the @xmath6 mode",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0-rays follows that of the parent proton population in the energy region above threshold . in the @xmath5 mode ,",
    "the resulting @xmath0-ray spectrum is broad , reflecting the presence of a quasi - feynman plateau which spans the entire rapidity space .",
    "the photon spectrum will deviate from the proton spectrum if the feynman plateau is not flat in rapidity space  @xcite , as suggested by tevatron data  @xcite .",
    "finally , for both the @xmath6 and @xmath5 modes , the decay of the charged pions yield a neutrino counterpart with energy and intensity similar to the photons .    in this paper , we discus in detail a third dynamic which can lead to tev @xmath0-rays : the photo - disintegration of nuclei at the source , followed by the photo - de - excitation of the daughter nuclei  @xcite . in order to generate tev @xmath0-rays as a result of emission of mev @xmath0-rays in the rest frame of the de - exciting nucleus ,",
    "the lorentz factor of the boosted nucleus must be @xmath8 for this boost factor , excitation via the giant dipole resonance ( @xmath9 in the nucleus rest frame ) is obtained with ambient photons with energies in the far ultraviolet ( usually defined as 1 - 20  ev ) .",
    "photons of these energies are expected from the lyman @xmath1 emissions from hot stars .",
    "this process clearly reduces the threshold energy requirement relative to @xmath6 .",
    "the important role played by the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in the photo - disintegration effectively suppresses the @xmath0-ray spectrum below 1  tev .    in recent decades",
    ", the cygnus spiral arm has been a site of @xmath0-ray signal candidates which tend to come and go . in the energy band @xmath10 data collected by the kiel air shower experiment",
    "@xcite show a @xmath11 excess of events in the direction of the binary system cygnus x-3 , with the typical 4.8 hr modulation previously observed in the mev  @xcite and tev  @xcite regions .",
    "this result , including the x  ray binary period , was later confirmed by the haverah park data  @xcite , with the additional observation of an abrupt steepening of the spectrum at @xmath12 .",
    "the distance ( @xmath13  kpc ) to cygnus x-3 slightly exceeds the minimum path length for cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) absorption in the energy band of the kiel experiment  @xcite . however , since absorptive effects decrease for energies beyond @xmath14  gev ( see fig .",
    "[ cygnusx3 ] ) , the observed steepening must be traced to a softening of the injection spectrum .    at a much higher energy @xmath15",
    "the analysis of the cumulative fly s eye data also revealed an excess of events from the direction of cygnus x-3 , with chance probability of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "a @xmath17 excess from this direction and in the same energy region has also been observed at the akeno air shower array  @xcite .",
    "the inferred signal fluxes are consistent at the 1@xmath18 level .",
    "however , the evidence for the 4.8 hr modulation is termed as `` weak '' by the fly s eye collaboration , and is absent in the akeno data .",
    "thus , one may infer that the high energy signals originate in a different source within the angular field of view of cygnus x-3 .",
    "more recent data from the casa - mia  @xcite and the hegra  @xcite experiments place restrictive bounds on steady state fluxes from the cygnus region .",
    "these can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cygnusx3 ] , and suggest that the earlier reported fluxes do not reflect current steady state activity . at this point",
    ", it is critical to note that only the hegra experiment has the angular resolution to place an upper limit on the steady state flux from cygnus x-3 , and at the same time observe significant activity ( at the 7@xmath18 level ) in the tev region from an unidentified source ( with no optical or x - ray counterparts ) which is within @xmath19 of the x - ray binary  @xcite .",
    "an excess at the @xmath20 level from the direction of this unidentified source is also present in the whipple data  @xcite .",
    "the strength and specificity of the source , and the distinct absence of an x - ray counterpart , make this source a good candidate for probing the nucleus photo - disintegration / de - excitation model for producing tev @xmath0-rays .    especially intriguing is the possible association of the tev hegra source with cygnus ob2 , a cluster of several thousands of young hot ob stars . at a relatively small distance ( @xmath21  light years ) to earth , this is the largest massive galactic stellar association .",
    "cosmic ray nuclei are expected to be trapped and accelerated through turbulent motions and collective effects of star winds . in this paper",
    "we present a model for explaining the hegra observations , in which the trapped high energy nuclei undergo stripping on the starlight background and their surviving fragments emit @xmath0-rays in transition to their ground states .",
    "a short version highlighting the salient features of the model has been issued as a companion paper  @xcite .",
    "the outline here is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we provide a detailed description of the salient characteristics of the cygnus ob2 association , including stellar counts , lifetime , size and energy considerations .",
    "section  [ iii ] contains a description of the hegra tev source , and summarize the different proposed explanations .",
    "the model is presented in sec .",
    "[ iv ] , including a calculation of the tev photon flux , following a discussion of the accompanying neutrino flux . in sec .",
    "[ v ] we compare the tev @xmath0-ray and neutrino yields in the model with those corresponding to the hadronic modes . in sec .",
    "[ vi ] we examine the possibility whether our model can accommodate the emission of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "conclusions are collected in sec .",
    "the cygnus ob2 ( vi cygni ) association is one of the most massive associations , with some of the most luminous stars , in our galaxy .",
    "it was first noticed by mnch and morgan  @xcite who , during the course of a classification of blue giants ( ob stars ) , found eleven of these objects in that region . since the pioneering spectroscopy and photometry of johnson and morgan  @xcite and subsequent works  @xcite , this region has been known to harbor a large population of massive and early type stars , which have been found to be highly reddened . the first comprehensive study of this stellar association  @xcite identified a few hundred ob stars as possible members based on photographic photometry .",
    "other photometric and spectroscopic studies  @xcite were carried out during following years confirming and extending the first results .",
    "cygnus ob2 is located at galactic coordinates @xmath22 , behind the great cygnus rift .",
    "the study performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , inferred an elliptical shape with major and minor axes of 48 and 28 , respectively , and estimated more than 3000 stars with at least 300 of ob spectral type , which resulted in a total mass for the association of @xmath23 .",
    "however , due to the extreme redenning in and around this region , which hampers the detection of even ob stars , the observed morphology was rather an artifact created by the particular extinction pattern of the field .",
    "a more recent work  @xcite based on a statistical study of point sources revealed by the _ two micron all sky survey _",
    "( 2mass ) in the near - infrared , shows that this association is much larger and richer than previously thought .",
    "the resulting stellar distribution reveals a rather regular and almost circular density profile with the center located at @xmath24 and with a pronounced maximum slightly offset at @xmath25 .",
    "stars counts show that 50% of the members are located within a radius of @xmath26 , and 90% within a radius of @xmath27 around the center , merging with the field stars at a radius of @xmath28 .",
    "the central stellar density reaches 4.5 stars / arcmin@xmath29 above the field star density , and drops to 50% at a radius of @xmath30 . by integrating the radial density profile , after substraction of the field star density ,",
    "the total number of ob stars was found to be @xmath31  @xcite , much larger than the earlier estimate of @xmath32300  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the total number of o - type stars was inferred to be @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this number must be cast as an upper limit , as the 2mass data do not allow a precise spectral determination and hence do not account for possible evolutionary effects , i.e. , the quoted number reflects the initial number of very massive ( @xmath34 ) stars , although some may have already evolved .",
    "this also agrees with more recent estimates  @xcite and suggests a total mass for the association of @xmath35 , where the primary uncertainty comes from the unknown lower mass cut - off . using the radial density profile , a central mass density of @xmath36 is determined  @xcite .",
    "early distance determinations revealed the proximity of this region , varying from 1.5 kpc  @xcite to 2.1  kpc  @xcite .",
    "more recent estimates have set this distance to @xmath37  @xcite . at such distance , the inner @xmath26 , with half the total number of objects , results in a physical radius of @xmath38 , with @xmath39  30 pc being the radius of the association .",
    "yet , a revision of the effective temperature scale of o - type stars yields a closer distance of @xmath321.5 kpc  @xcite , when the age of the association is taken into account in fitting the late - o and early - b dwarfs to model isochrones .",
    "it is from the superposition of the isochrones ( calculated using the theoretical evolutionary tracks of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite ) on the hertzsprung - russell diagrams , that the age of the association has been estimated to lie between 14 myr  @xcite , compatible with other estimates  @xcite .",
    "this range reflects the dispersion of the upper main sequence and agrees with the fact that the observed large number of o - type stars implies that the association should be younger than @xmath325  myr , because in the case of coeval star formation , the number of this type of stars decreases rapidly  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fact that there are some wolf - rayet stars within cygnus ob2 suggests an age larger than @xmath322 myr . on the other hand , the non - detection of any supernova remnant in cygnus ob2  @xcite points to an association",
    "younger than @xmath324 myr .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a few slightly evolved supergiants ( an o3 if@xmath40 star , three wolf - rayet stars and two lbv candidates ) suggests that the star formation in the asociation was not strictly coeval and there are even indications of ongoing star formation  @xcite .",
    "this fact would narrow down the quoted age boundaries .",
    "early estimates of the wind mechanical luminosity for the cygnus ob2 association gave @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "however , the improved data on the population of the region required a revision of this estimate . by using a detailed analysis of radiatively wind models for hot stars ,",
    "it has been shown than at an early stage ( @xmath42 myr ) , the wind mechanical luminosity is maintained approximately constant  @xcite , being @xmath43 per solar mass , which , for the association , yields @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "after the first @xmath45 myr , the luminosity increases further as wolf - rayet stars appear .",
    "this estimates assumes stars of solar metallicity and a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) slope .",
    "there have been different calculations for the imf slopes  @xcite which however do not agree with each other , although lie in the interval @xmath46 ( @xmath47 being the salpeter slope ) .",
    "nevertheless , these discrepancies are due to systematic uncertainties and hence , a reasonable approximation is to assume a uniform canonical salpeter slope .",
    "should the metallicity be close to the solar value , this implies  @xcite that the estimate of the wind mechanical luminosity is probably correct within a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "other values for the metallicity would modify this prediction by at most a factor @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "the total lyman continuum luminosity of the stars has been estimated to be @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been observations of tev @xmath0-rays from the northeast boundary of this association ( see fig .",
    "[ cygob2 ] )  @xcite .",
    "these observations will be discussed in the following section , and will constitute the focus of this paper .",
    "the hegra system of imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes ( hegra iact - system ) consisted of five identical erenkov telescopes ( each with 8.5 m@xmath29 mirror area ) and employed a stereoscopic technique achieving an angular and energy resolution better than @xmath50 and 15% , respectively , for @xmath0-rays on an event - by - event basis with energies from 0.5  tev to @xmath32 50  tev  @xcite .",
    "the observation of the cygnus region by the hegra iact - system has allowed the serendipitous discovery of a tev source in the outskirts of the core of cygnus ob2  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the total 278.3 hours of observations performed in two periods from 1999 to 2002 ( 120.5 hours from 1999 to 2001  @xcite and 157.8 hours during 2002  @xcite ) has revealed the presence of a steady ( and possibly extended ) tev source , with hard injection spectrum .",
    "interestingly , there have been earlier claims of a multi - tev excess in this region  @xcite .",
    "the excess significance of the tev source is @xmath51 and it appears extended at more than @xmath52 level with a morphology which is suitably described by a gaussian profile .",
    "the source is termed tev j2032 + 4130 after the position of the center of gravity .",
    "its extension ( gaussian @xmath53 radius ) is @xmath54 , which at a distance of 1.7 kpc results in @xmath55 pc .",
    "three different types of intrinsic morphology were tested  @xcite ( disc , volume and surface ) , but the data can not discriminate between them .",
    "the energy spectrum determination yielded a pure power - law fit with a hard photon index , showing no indication for an exponential cut - off , given by  @xcite    @xmath56    which implies a flux above 1 tev given by @xmath57 these results imply a luminosity of @xmath58 erg / s above 1  tev , which is well within the kinetic energy budget of cygnus ob2 , and indeed , also within that of a number of notable member stars  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cygob2 ] , this signal is located at the edge of the error circle of the egret source 3eg j2033 + 4118 and within the @xmath3210 pc - radius core circle of the cygnus ob2 association .",
    "the egret observations  @xcite lie in the energy range below 10  gev , and closely display a spectrum @xmath59 it will be of important significance for our discussion that when extrapolated to the tev range according to the @xmath2 behavior , the flux exceeds the hegra flux by several orders of magnitude . hence we surmise that these observations constitute two different sources .    an additional set of observations performed during 1989 - 90 by the whipple observatory atmospheric erenkov imaging telescope  @xcite has been recently reanalyzed in the light of the hegra data .",
    "these confirm an excess in the same direction as j2032 + 4130 , although with considerably larger flux , above a peak energy energy response of 0.6  tev .",
    "the statistical significance of the signal is only 10% smaller with selection of events above 1.2  tev .",
    "however , the large differences between the flux levels can not be explained as errors in estimation of the sensitivity of the experiments since they have been calibrated by the simultaneous observations of other tev sources .",
    "so far no clear counterparts at other wavelengths have been identified , and moreover , the observed spectrum is not easily accommodated with synchrotron radiation by electrons  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty to accommodate the spectrum by conventional electromagnetic mechanisms has been exacerbated by the failure of chandra and vla to detect x - rays or radiowaves signaling acceleration of any electrons  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a leptonic origin is not yet excluded , especially if the tev source is actually located in the vicinity of cygnus x-3 .",
    "the suggested model  @xcite proposes a jet - driven termination shock at the boundary where the relativistic jet meets the interstellar medium .",
    "this results in synchroton and tev inverse - compton emission from the accelerated electrons  @xcite , giving rise to the observed signal",
    ". such a jet could emanate either from an as - yet undiscovered microquasar or from cygnus x-3 .",
    "interestingly , the tev signal aligns well with the northern error cone of the bi - lobal jet of cygnus x-3  @xcite . for the observed angular separations",
    ", this would place the tev source at a distance of 10 kpc from earth , and around 70 pc from cygnus x-3 .",
    "the fact that there is no catalogued x - ray sources within the @xmath60 error circle of the tev source would disfavor a leptonic origin at cygnus ob2 .",
    "we now briefly discuss some models in which accelerated protons and nuclei interacting with a local dense gas cloud  @xcite or with stellar winds  @xcite , produce photons from @xmath4 decay .",
    "in the case of gas cloud interactions  @xcite , an interstellar density of @xmath61 and an injection efficiency ( the ratio of cosmic ray energy to the kinetic energy of the accelerating winds ) of 0.08% reproduces well the observed tev spectrum .",
    "however , such a large density has been called into question  @xcite because a re - assessment  @xcite of the co - h@xmath62 conversion factor for this type of environment ( used for calibration ) would imply a considerably lower density , @xmath63 .",
    "with such a density , a much larger injection efficiency @xmath32 25% would be required .",
    "a different model in terms of cosmic ray illumination of stellar winds has been suggested to explain the signal through hadronic interactions in the innermost parts of the winds of massive ob stars  @xcite .",
    "however , a more recent detailed study of the stellar winds  @xcite , including pressure effects and a more accurate estimate of the ( lower ) mass - loss rate for ob stars , resulted in a significant reduction in the photon emission rate .",
    "thus , if only the currently known stars exist , the predicted flux from this model is too low to comfortably explain the tev source .    another suggested possibility has been that of a point - like origin of the tev signal related to an unusual transient x - ray source which lies @xmath64 from the center of gravity of tev j2032 + 4130  @xcite .",
    "however , the position and variability of this x - ray source and mainly , the confirmed extension of the tev source makes this a remote alternative , although it remains possible that several point - like tev sources could be masquerading as a single extended source .",
    "the tev signal could also be interpreted as originated in the wind nebulae of an as - yet undetected recent pulsar ( similar to vela - type pulsars ) , as a result of hadronic or leptonic interactions  @xcite .",
    "this pulsar must have been formed @xmath65 years ago in a core collapse of one of the massive stars in the cygnus ob2 association .",
    "however , the non - observation of any supernova remnant in the region , as well as the greatly lowered estimates of the ambient gas density , seem to pose a serious challenge for this model .    in summary",
    ", there is no single compelling explanation for the various characteristics of tev j2032 + 4130  @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we present a new mechanism for explaining the hegra data .",
    "there are two processes by which the nucleus may produce @xmath0-rays , photo - disintegration of the nucleus by ambient photons followed by de - excitation of a daughter nucleus , and photo - pion production followed by decay of the neutral pions .",
    "the two processes have different thresholds and different signatures . in this section ,",
    "we are concerned with the former mechanism , emphasized more than a decade ago by moskalenko and collaborators  @xcite , but largely ignored by the rest of the @xmath0-ray community . in the following section we will compare and contrast the two processes .      the interaction between photons and high energy nuclei results in the emission of nucleons .",
    "the relevant photonuclear interaction process for the relevant energies have been studied from the point of view of the collective and the shell models  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that collective nuclear states dominate the interaction , with low angular momentum modes preferred . in the energy region which extends from threshold for single - nucleon emission @xmath32  10  mev up to @xmath32 30 mev the gdr dominates .",
    "the gdr typically de - excites by the statistical emission of a single nucleon . above the gdr region , and up to the photo - pion production threshold at @xmath66  mev , the non - resonant processes provide a much smaller cross section with a relatively flat dependence on energy .    the photo - disintegration rate for a highly relativistic nucleus with energy @xmath67 ( where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor ) propagating through an isotropic photon background with energy @xmath68 and spectrum @xmath69 , normalized so that the total number of photons in a box is @xmath70 , is  @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the cross section for photo - disintegration of a nucleus of mass @xmath73 by a photon of energy @xmath74 in the rest frame of the nucleus .",
    "the cross section for all the different nuclear species has been obtained through a direct fit to data  @xcite . for medium and heavy nuclei @xmath75",
    "the total photon absorption cross section can be approximated by a dipole form ( sometimes called a `` breit - wigner '' or `` lorentzian '' ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the width , @xmath78 is the central value of the gdr energy band , and @xmath79 is the normalization .",
    "we have found that for the considerations in the present work , the cross section can be safely approximated by the single pole of the narrow - width approximation , @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 )  @xcite .",

    "the result is @xmath89 we then verify that for @xmath90fe and for the cmb temperature ( @xmath91 ) , this solution agrees to within 20% with the parametrization given in  @xcite .",

    "for all three nuclei , the disintegration time exceeds the diffusion time ( @xmath120  @xcite ) of the nucleus in the association .",

    "a seemingly different , but in fact closely related subject we will discuss in this section is the intriguing anisotropy that has been observed by several experiments in the energy range near @xmath328 .",
    "analyses of the data collected by the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) seem to indicate a @xmath52 excess of events from the direction of the galactic plane in the narrow energy window @xmath329  gev to @xmath330  gev  @xcite . a galactic plane enhancement at the @xmath331 level between @xmath332  gev and @xmath330  gev has also been reported by the fly s eye collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy in the agasa data sample is dominated by hot spots near the galactic center and the cygnus region .",
    "however , based on a data sample larger than any previous experiment , the pierre auger collaboration has reported no evidence for such an excess from the direction of the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "the complete isotropy below about @xmath333  gev revealed by kascade data  @xcite vitiate direction - preserving photons as primaries .",
    "therefore , the excess from the galactic plane is very suggestive of neutrons as candidate primaries , because the directional signal requires relatively - stable neutral primaries , and time - dilated neutrons can reach the earth from typical galactic distances when the neutron energy exceeds @xmath334  gev .",

    "there was indeed an excess , with a poissonian probability of 0.013 , but at energies above @xmath335 gev .",
    "however , a more recent analysis by the group at leeds  @xcite , based on improved shower simulations , more selective trigger criteria , and a reduction of the zenith acceptance from 60@xmath336 to @xmath337 , reveals that previous  @xcite energy estimates need to be reduced by about 30% .",
    "it is then suggestive that the excess may overlap the region of interest .",
    "one can encourage an event - by - event analysis to see whether this is indeed the case ; in the meantime one may reserve judgment with respect to presence or absence of anisotropy in the haverah park data .",
    "more recently , the hires collaboration has carried out a systematic search for point sources in the northern sky . in an initial series of papers , they report no significant excess for energies greater than @xmath330 gev  @xcite , @xmath338 gev  @xcite , and @xmath339 gev  @xcite .",
    "all these energy thresholds exceed the range above @xmath340  gev where the akeno and fly s eye anisotropies were reported .",
    "motivated by the present study , we have asked the hires collaboration to extend their analysis down to the energy threshold of interest , in the direction of cygnus .",

    "this possibility can be monitored with data to be collected at the northern site of the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we will proceed on the assumption that the anisotropy reported by the fly s eye  @xcite and akeno  @xcite collaborations originated in a burst taking place in cygnus ob2 during a 10-yr period , and assess the implications for source energetics .    for nuclei with energies",

    "interesting observations have been made , but have not held up at statistically significant levels .",
    "more recently , improved efficiency and higher resolution have provided signals at discovery level .",
    "perhaps , the most precise of such signals is the ( 1999 - 2002 ) hegra detection of the unidentified tev j2032 + 4130 source , with an average flux @xmath351 of the crab nebula  @xcite .",
    "this bright `` hot spot '' , at the edge of the very active cygnus ob2 star association , has been recently confirmed through a re - analysis of `` old '' data collected with the whipple observatory  @xcite .",
    "however , the average flux ( @xmath352 of the crab ) detected during 1989 - 1990 is well above that reported by the hegra collaboration .",
    "neither the whipple nor the hegra experiments see any evidence for variability within their individual databases .",
    "the large differences between the flux levels can not be explained as errors in estimation of the sensitivity of the experiments because they have been calibrated by the simultaneous observations of other tev sources .",
    "certainly more data are needed to resolve this issue .",
    "happily , data are currently flowing from the milagro telescope  @xcite and the tibet air shower array  @xcite experiments at a significant rapid rate .    in this paper",
    ", we have focussed on the unidentified tev @xmath0-ray source observed by the hegra collaboration .",
    "because of the absence of x - ray or radio counterparts , it has been difficult to provide a compelling explanation for the origin of the @xmath0-rays from the hegra source",
    ". this has motivated us to present an alternative model , which has some well - defined predictions for future observations , both in @xmath0-ray facilities and at neutrino telescopes such as icecube .",
    "the model proposes that the observed tev @xmath0-rays are the result of lorentz - boosted mev @xmath0-rays emitted on the de - excitation of daughter nuclei following collisions of pev nuclei with a hot ultraviolet photon background .",
    "our results include the following :    \\(1 ) there is a specific prediction of a suppression on the @xmath0-ray spectrum in the region @xmath3  this because of the need to achieve the giant dipole resonance for disintegration through collision with @xmath32 few ev photons .",
    "\\(2 ) the flux of @xmath0-rays produced through nuclei de - excitation process dominates by an order of magnitude that resulting from @xmath4 production and decay in collisions of nuclei with the ambient gas background .",
    "\\(3 ) the presence of a significant neutrino signal from decay of neutrons produced in the course of the photo - disintegration is strongly contingent on the abundance of @xmath215he in the source , mirroring its observed prevalence in cosmic rays .",
    "this compensates by an order of magnitude over its reduced photo - disintegration rate , and results in a @xmath353 signal at icecube ( after oscillation from @xmath279 ) comparable to the @xmath270 signal from hadronic interactions ( as noted previously , this is sufficient to establish a 15@xmath18 discovery in 15 years of observation.)the ability of icecube to measure flavor ratios can distinguish between these possibilities  @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) for this model to succeed , a high efficiency is required for accelerating a low energy population of nuclei at the source to pev energies .",
    "thus , evidence for the model ( such as a substantial suppression in the @xmath0-ray spectrum below @xmath354 ) could provide some insight into source dynamics .",
    "\\(5 ) it is noteworthy that the contribution to the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux component resulting from the interaction of extreme - energy cosmic ray nuclei with the background radiation fields permeating the universe  @xcite is well below the observed egret data  @xcite ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in summary , the availability of new data in coming years in @xmath0-ray , x - ray , neutrino and cosmic - ray sector experiments affords an outstanding opportunity for study of high energy processes in extreme environments .",
