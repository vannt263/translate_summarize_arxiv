    "this conjecture has a long history of proofs .",
    "a first partial proof was given by bogomolov in @xcite , who proved the statement when @xmath3 is replaced by its @xmath7-primary part for a prime number  @xmath7 ; he applies results of serre , tate and raynaud ( see @xcite ) on the existence of hodge - tate module structures on the tate module of abelian varieties over discrete valuation rings .",
    "a full proof of the conjecture was then given by raynaud in @xcite ( see @xcite for the case @xmath8 ) ; his proof follows from a study of the reduction of @xmath0 modulo @xmath9 .",
    "a third and full proof of the conjecture was given by hrushovski in @xcite ; he uses weil s theorem on the characteristic polynomial of the frobenius morphism on abelian varieties over finite fields in conjunction with the model theory ( of mathematical logic ) of the theory of fields with a distinguished automorphism .",
    "a fourth proof of the conjecture was given by ullmo and zhang ( based on ideas of szpiro ) in @xcite and @xcite and goes via diophantine approximation and arakelov theory .",
    "they actually prove a more general conjecture of bogomolov which generalizes the manin - mumford conjecture .",
    "this article was inspired by hrushovski s proof .",
    "the bulk of hrushovski s proof lies in the model theory part .",
    "it culminates in a result which , when applied to the special case of abelian varieties and stripped of model theoretic terminology , is essentially theorem  [ hmain ] below . in section",
    "2 we prove theorem  [ hmain ] with classical algebraic geometry alone . neither scheme theory , nor arakelov theory , nor mathematical logic",
    "are used . in section  3 , for the sake of completeness",
    ", we show how to apply theorem  [ hmain ] to prove the manin - mumford conjecture .",

    "for ease of notation , we use the language of classical algebraic geometry ; thus @xmath0 and @xmath2 denote the respective sets of @xmath11-valued points .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 are defined already over the fixed field  @xmath14 .",
    "the automorphism of @xmath0 induced by @xmath12 is again denoted by  @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath15 $ ] be a monic polynomial with integral coefficients . in ( * ?",

    "let @xmath16 denote the kernel of the homomorphism @xmath17 .",
    "assume that no complex root of @xmath18 is root of unity .",
    "then @xmath19 where @xmath5 is a finite set and each @xmath6 is the translate by an element of @xmath0 of an abelian subvariety of  @xmath0 , immersed in  @xmath2 .",
    "[ hmain ]    * remark * if roots of unity are not excluded , the group @xmath16 becomes too large for such a result .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 divides  @xmath18 , all points of @xmath0 over the fixed field @xmath21 of @xmath22 are contained in  @xmath16 .",
    "write @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be the endomorphism of @xmath27 defined by the matrix @xmath28 which is the companion matrix of the polynomial  @xmath18 , and note that @xmath29",
    ". in the obvious way @xmath12 induces an automorphism of  @xmath27 , denoted again by  @xmath12 , that sends @xmath30 to itself .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the kernel of the homomorphism @xmath32 . by construction",
    ", there is a canonical bijection @xmath33 since @xmath34 , this induces a bijection @xmath35 its inverse is given by the projection to the first factor @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , we are now reduced to the following theorem , applied to @xmath37 in place of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath38 be an algebraic endomorphism that commutes with @xmath12 and that satisfies @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the kernel of the homomorphism @xmath39 .",
    "assume that no complex root of @xmath18 is root of unity .",
    "then @xmath40 where @xmath5 is a finite set and each @xmath6 is the translate by an element of @xmath0 of an abelian subvariety of  @xmath0 , immersed in  @xmath2 .",
    "[ hmain2 ]    if @xmath11 is algebraic over the fixed field  @xmath14 , every element @xmath41 satisfies @xmath42 for some @xmath43 . in other words",

    "the assumptions on @xmath26 and @xmath18 imply that @xmath45 is an isogeny ; hence @xmath46 is a torsion element .",
    "it follows that @xmath31 is a torsion subgroup , and the theorem follows from the manin - mumford conjecture in this case . however , the scope of the above theorem is somewhat wider , and the manin - mumford conjecture will be deduced from it .",
    "let @xmath47 be the zariski closure of @xmath48 .",
    "we claim that @xmath49 . to see this , note first that @xmath12 commutes with  @xmath26 , and so @xmath50 . by assumption",
    "we have @xmath34 ; hence @xmath51 . since @xmath52 comes from an automorphism of the underlying field ,",
    "it is a homeomorphism for the zariski topology , so we have @xmath53 . on the other hand , the maps @xmath12 and @xmath26 coincide on  @xmath31 , which implies @xmath54 . as @xmath26 is a proper algebraic morphism",
    ", we deduce that @xmath55 . clearly , theorem  [ hmain2 ] is now reduced to the following theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * th .",
    "3 ) for the case where @xmath26 is the multiplication by an integer @xmath56 ) .    let @xmath0 be an abelian variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero .",
    "let @xmath38 be an algebraic endomorphism none of whose eigenvalues on @xmath57 is a root of unity .",
    "let @xmath47 be a closed subvariety of @xmath0 satisfying @xmath55 .",
    "then @xmath47 is a finite union of translates of abelian subvarieties of  @xmath0 .",
    "[ hmain3 ]    we proceed by induction on the dimension @xmath58 of  @xmath0 . for @xmath59",
    "the statement is obvious ; hence we assume @xmath60 .",
    "next observe that @xmath61 .",
    "thus if @xmath26 is not surjective , we can replace @xmath0 by @xmath62 and @xmath47 by @xmath63 , and are finished by induction .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath26 is an isogeny .",
    "since @xmath26 is proper and @xmath55 , every irreducible component of @xmath47 is the image under @xmath26 of some irreducible component of  @xmath47 .",
    "since the set of these irreducible components is finite , it is therefore permuted by  @xmath26 .",
    "we fix such an irreducible component @xmath64 and an integer @xmath43 such that @xmath65 .",
    "any power @xmath66 is an isogeny , and since @xmath67 , it is a separable isogeny . as a morphism of schemes",
    "it is therefore a finite tale galois covering with galois group @xmath68 , acting by translations on  @xmath0 .",
    "the same follows for the induced covering @xmath69 .",
    "as @xmath64 is irreducible , the irreducible components of @xmath70 are transitively permuted by @xmath68 and each of them has dimension @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 , and so @xmath64 itself is one of these irreducible components .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the stabilizer of @xmath64 in @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath75 is generically a finite tale galois covering with galois group  @xmath74 .        for any @xmath79 ,",
    "the morphism @xmath75 is finite separable of degree @xmath80 .",
    "since degrees are multiplicative in composites , this degree is also equal to @xmath81 . thus if @xmath77 , we find that @xmath80 becomes arbitrarily large with  @xmath82",
    ". therefore @xmath76 contains arbitrarily large finite subgroups , so it can not be finite .",
    "since @xmath64 is irreducible , the assertion is obvious when @xmath84 .",
    "so we assume that @xmath85 .",
    "the assumption @xmath83 implies that @xmath86 induces a finite ( separable ) morphism @xmath87 of degree @xmath88 .",
    "the set of fixed points of any positive power @xmath89 is then @xmath90 . on the other hand",
    "the assumptions on @xmath26 and @xmath18 imply that @xmath91 is an isogeny on  @xmath0 .",
    "thus this fixed point set is finite for every @xmath79 ; hence @xmath92 has infinite order .    assume now that @xmath76 is finite .",
    "by ueno s theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    ".  3.10 ) @xmath64 is then of general type , in the sense that any smooth projective variety birationally equivalent to @xmath64 is of general type ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* def .  1.7 ) ) .",
    "but the group of birational automorphisms of any irreducible projective variety @xmath64 of general type is finite ( see @xcite and also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th . 10.11 ) ) which yields a contradiction .",
    "if @xmath64 is a single point , it is a translate of the trivial abelian subvariety of  @xmath0 .",
    "otherwise we know from the lemmas above that @xmath78 , and we can use the induction hypothesis . let @xmath93 denote the identity component of @xmath76 . since @xmath94 , we also have @xmath95 .",
    "set @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and let @xmath98 denote the endomorphism of @xmath99 induced by  @xmath86",
    ". then we have @xmath100 , and every eigenvalue of @xmath98 on @xmath101 is an eigenvalue of @xmath86 on @xmath57 and therefore not a root of unity . by theorem  [ hmain3 ] ,",
    "applied to @xmath102 in place of @xmath103 , we now deduce that @xmath104 is a finite union of translates of abelian subvarieties of  @xmath99 .",
    "but @xmath64 is irreducible ; hence so is  @xmath104 . thus @xmath104 itself is a translate of an abelian subvariety .",
    "that abelian subvariety is equal to @xmath105 for some abelian subvariety @xmath106 containing  @xmath93 , and so @xmath64 is a translate of  @xmath107 , as desired .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem  [ hmain3 ] , and thus also of theorems [ hmain2 ] and  [ hmain ] .    *",
    "remark * suppose that in the statement of the preceding theorem , we replace the assumption that none of the eigenvalues of @xmath26 on @xmath57 is a root of unity by the weaker assumption that none of the eigenvalues of @xmath26 on @xmath57 is an algebraic unit .",
    "this case is sufficient for the application to the manin - mumford conjecture . under this weaker assumption ,",
    "the following alternative proof of lemma [ lemma_aut ] can be given ; it does not use the theorems of ueno and matsumura but only elementary properties of cycle classes .",
    "we work under the hypotheses of lemma [ lemma_aut ] and with the notations used above .",
    "first , everything can be defined over a countable algebraically closed subfield of  @xmath11 , and this subfield can be embedded into  @xmath108 ; thus without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath109 .",
    "then for every integer @xmath110 we abbreviate @xmath111 .",
    "let @xmath112 and let @xmath113 be the cycle class of @xmath114 .",
    "we calculate the cycle class of @xmath115 in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", we have seen that the group @xmath116 acts transitively on the set of irreducible components of @xmath115 ; the assumption @xmath83 implies that it also acts faithfully .",
    "thus the number of irreducible components is @xmath117 .",
    "recall that @xmath64 is one of them . since translation on @xmath0",
    "does not change cycle classes , we find that all irreducible components of @xmath115 have cycle class @xmath118 ; hence @xmath119 . on the other hand @xmath26",
    "induces a pullback homomorphism @xmath120 for every @xmath110 , and by functoriality of cycle classes we have @xmath121 . as @xmath118 is non - zero",
    ", we deduce that @xmath117 is an eigenvalue of @xmath122 on @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath124 , which is also the codimension of any point in  @xmath0 . repeating the above calculation with the cycle class of a point",
    ", we deduce that @xmath117 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath122 on the highest non - vanishing cohomology group @xmath125 .",
    "since cup product yields isomorphisms @xmath126 for all @xmath110 , which are compatible with  @xmath122 , it yields an @xmath122-equivariant perfect pairing @xmath127 . from this",
    "we deduce that @xmath88 is an eigenvalue of @xmath122 on @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , this eigenvalue must be a product of @xmath129 eigenvalues of @xmath122 on  @xmath130 .",
    "now the eigenvalues of @xmath122 on @xmath130 are precisely those of @xmath26 on @xmath57 and their complex conjugates . by assumption , they are algebraic integers but no algebraic units .",
    "thus a product of such numbers can be @xmath88 only if it is the empty product .",
    "this shows that @xmath131 , that is , @xmath132 ; hence @xmath64 is a point , as desired .      as a preparation",
    "let @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a prime number and @xmath135 .",
    "let @xmath136 be the unique field with @xmath137 elements .",
    "let @xmath0 be an abelian variety defined over  @xmath136 .",
    "as in classical algebraic geometry we identify @xmath0 with the set of its @xmath138-valued points .",
    "let @xmath7 be a prime number different from  @xmath134 , and let @xmath139 be the @xmath7-adic tate module of  @xmath0 , which is a free @xmath140-module of rank @xmath141 .",
    "we denote by @xmath92 the frobenius morphism @xmath142 , which acts on the coordinates of points by taking @xmath137-th powers .",
    "it also acts on the tate module via its action on the torsion points .",
    "the following result , an analogue of the riemann hypothesis , is due to weil ( see @xcite ) :    let @xmath143 be an indeterminate .",
    "the characteristic polynomial of @xmath92 on @xmath144 is a monic polynomial in @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "it is independent of  @xmath7 , and all its complex roots have absolute value  @xmath146 . [ weilrh ]",
    "consider now an abelian variety @xmath0 defined over  @xmath1 and a closed subvariety @xmath2 of  @xmath0 .",
    "we choose a number field @xmath147 over which both @xmath13 can be defined and fix their models over  @xmath148 . for any abelian group @xmath149 we write @xmath150 for the group of torsion points of  @xmath149 .",
    "moreover , for any prime @xmath134 we write @xmath151 for the subgroup of torsion points of order a power of  @xmath134 , and @xmath152 for the subgroup of torsion points of order prime to  @xmath134 .",
    "note that @xmath153 .",
    "choose a prime ideal @xmath154 of @xmath155 where @xmath0 has good reduction .",
    "let @xmath136 be the finite field @xmath156 , where @xmath137 is a power of a prime number  @xmath134 .",
    "the following lemma is lemma 5.0.10 in @xcite ; we reproduce the proof for the convenience of the reader .",
    "we use weil s theorem [ weilrh ] and reduction modulo @xmath154 to obtain an automorphism of @xmath157 and a polynomial that we can feed in theorem  [ hmain ] to obtain theorem  [ mm ] .",

    "extend the embedding @xmath164 to an embedding of the algebraic closures @xmath165 , and the surjection @xmath166 to a surjection @xmath167 . on the prime - to-@xmath134 torsion groups",
    "we then obtain natural isomorphisms @xmath168 the second isomorphism expresses the fact that the field of definition of every prime - to-@xmath134 torsion point is unramified at  @xmath163 .",
    "now , as before , let @xmath92 denote the automorphism of @xmath138 and of @xmath169 induced by the frobenius morphism over  @xmath136 . then @xmath92 can be lifted to an element @xmath170 making the above isomorphisms equivariant .",
    "to see this , one first lifts @xmath92 to an element @xmath171 of @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the maximal unramified extension of  @xmath174 .",
    "this lifting exists and is unique by ( * ? ?",

    "this element can then be lifted further to a ( non - unique ) element @xmath175 of @xmath176 , since @xmath177 is a subfield of @xmath178 . by construction",

    "the restriction of @xmath179 to @xmath157 gives the desired element  @xmath181 .",
    "let @xmath182 be the characteristic polynomial of @xmath92 on @xmath183 for any prime number @xmath184 . by construction , we then have @xmath185 on @xmath186 . by weil s result quoted above",

    "we deduce that @xmath187 on @xmath188 .",
    "finally , weil s result also describes the complex roots of  @xmath189 .",
    "let now @xmath190 , @xmath191 be the fields generated over @xmath148 by the coordinates of all points in @xmath188 , resp .  in @xmath192 .",
