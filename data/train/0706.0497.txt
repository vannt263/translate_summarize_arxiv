    "this paper deals with the connected components of random graphs and hypergraphs . recall that a _ @xmath1-uniform hypergraph _ @xmath8 is a set @xmath9 of _ vertices _ together with a set @xmath10 of edges @xmath11 of size @xmath12 .",
    "the _ order _ of @xmath8 is the number @xmath13 of vertices of @xmath8 , and the _ size _ of @xmath8 is the number @xmath14 of edges .",
    "moreover , a @xmath15-uniform hypergraph is called a _",
    "graph_.    further , we say that a vertex @xmath16 is _ reachable _ from @xmath17 if there exists edges @xmath18 such that @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "then reachability is an equivalence relation , and the equivalence classes are called the _ components _ of @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath8 has only a single component , then @xmath8 is _",
    "connected_.    we let @xmath23 signify the maximum order of a component of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , for all hypergraphs @xmath8 the vertex set @xmath9 will consist of integers .",
    "therefore , the subsets of @xmath9 can be ordered lexicographically , and we call the lexicographically first component of @xmath8 that has order @xmath23 the _ largest component _ of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we denote by @xmath24 the size of the largest component .",
    "we will consider two models of random @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs .",
    "the random hypergraph @xmath0 has the vertex set @xmath25 , and each of the @xmath3 possible edges is present with probability @xmath26 independently of all others .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 is a uniformly distributed hypergraph with vertex set @xmath25 and with exactly @xmath6 edges . in the case",
    "@xmath27 , the notation @xmath28 , @xmath29 is common .",
    "finally , we say that the random hypergraph @xmath0 enjoys a certain property @xmath30 _ with high probability _ ( `` w.h.p . '' ) if the probability that @xmath30 holds in @xmath0 tends to @xmath31 as @xmath32 ; a similar terminology is used for @xmath5 .      in the pioneering papers  @xcite on the theory of random graphs , erds  and",
    "rnyi  studied the component structure of the random graph @xmath33 . since  @xcite ,",
    "the component structure of random discrete objects ( e.g. , graphs , hypergraphs , digraphs ,   ) has been among the main subjects of discrete probability theory .",
    "one reason for this is the connection to statistical physics and percolation ( as `` mean field models '' ) ; another reason is the impact of these considerations on computer science ( e.g. , due to relations to computational problems such as max cut or max @xmath15-sat  @xcite ) .    in  @xcite erds  and",
    "rnyi  showed that if @xmath34 remains fixed as @xmath32 and @xmath35 , then the probability that @xmath33 is connected is asymptotically @xmath36 as @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath33 is a uniformly distributed graph , this result immediately yields the asymptotic number of connected graphs of order @xmath2 and size @xmath6 .",
    "the relevance of this result , possibly the most important contribution of  @xcite is that erds  and rnyi  solved this _ enumerative _ problem ( `` how many connected graphs of order @xmath2 and size @xmath6 exist ? '' ) via _ probabilistic _ methods ( namely , the method of moments for proving convergence to a poisson distribution ) .",
    "furthermore , in  @xcite erds  and rnyi  went on to study ( among others ) the component structure of _ sparse _ random graphs with @xmath37 edges .",
    "the main result is that the order @xmath38 of the largest component undergoes a _ phase transition _ as @xmath39 .",
    "let us state a more general version from  @xcite , which covers @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs : let either @xmath40 and @xmath41 , or @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; we refer to @xmath44 as the _ average degree _ of @xmath8 .",
    "then the result is that    * if @xmath45 for an arbitrarily small but fixed @xmath46 , then @xmath47 w.h.p .",
    "* by contrast , if @xmath48 , then @xmath8 features a unique component of order @xmath49 w.h.p .",
    ", which is called the _ giant component_. more precisely , @xmath50 w.h.p . where @xmath51 is the unique solution to the transcendental equation @xmath52 that lies strictly between @xmath53 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the second largest component has order @xmath54 .    in this paper",
    "we present a new , _ purely probabilistic _ approach for investigating the component structure of sparse random graphs and , more generally , hypergraphs in greater detail .",
    "more precisely , we obtain _ local limit theorems _ for the joint distribution of the order and size of the largest component in a random graph or hypergraph @xmath40 or @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we determine the joint limiting distribution of @xmath23 and @xmath24 precisely . furthermore ,",
    "from these local limit theorems we derive a number of interesting consequences .",
    "for instance , we compute the asymptotic probability that @xmath8 is connected , which yields an asymptotic formula for the number of connected hypergraphs of a given order and size .",
    "thus , as in  @xcite , we solve a ( highly non - trivial ) _ enumerative _ problem via probabilistic techniques .",
    "in addition , we infer a local limit theorem for the distribution of the number of edges of @xmath0 , given the ( exponentially unlikely ) event that @xmath0 is connected .    while in the case of _ graphs _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath27 ) these results are either known or can be derived from prior work ( in particular , @xcite ) , all our results are new for @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs with @xmath55 .",
    "besides , we believe that our probabilistic approach is interesting in the case of graphs as well , because we completely avoid the use of involved enumerative methods , which are the basis of most of the previous papers on our subject ( including  @xcite ) . in effect , our techniques are fairly generic and may apply to further problems of a related nature .",
    "our first result is the _ local limit theorem _ for the joint distribution of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "[ thm_hnplocal ] let @xmath58 be a fixed integer .",
    "for any two compact sets @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and for any @xmath61 there exists @xmath62 such that the following holds .",
    "let @xmath4 be a sequence such that @xmath63 for all @xmath2 and let @xmath64 be the unique solution to ( [ eqcomv ] ) .",
    "further , let @xmath65 suppose that @xmath66 and that @xmath67 are integers such that @xmath68 and @xmath69 satisfy @xmath70 .",
    "then letting @xmath71 we have @xmath72    theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] characterizes the joint limiting distribution of @xmath56 and @xmath57 _ precisely _ , because it actually yields the asymptotic probability that @xmath73 and @xmath74 attain any two values @xmath75 , @xmath76 ; namely , the theorem shows that @xmath77and it guarantees some uniformity of convergence .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath78 is as small as @xmath79 as @xmath32 . since @xmath78 is just the density function of a bivariate normal distribution , theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] readily yields the following _ central limit theorem _ for the joint distribution of @xmath80 .",
    "[ cor_hnplocal ] keep the notation from  theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] .",
    "then @xmath81 converge to the normal distribution with mean @xmath53 and covariance matrix @xmath82 .",
    "nonetheless , we stress that theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] is considerably more precise than corollary  [ cor_hnplocal ] . for the latter result",
    "just yields the asymptotic probability that @xmath83 and simultaneously @xmath84 for any fixed @xmath85 .",
    "hence , corollary  [ cor_hnplocal ] just determines @xmath80 up to errors of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , while theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] actually yields the probability of hitting _ exactly _ specific values @xmath67 .",
    "the second main result of this paper is a local limit theorem for the joint distribution of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "[ thm_hnmlocal ] let @xmath58 be a fixed integer .",

    "let @xmath90 be a sequence of integers such that @xmath91 for all @xmath2 and let @xmath64 be the unique solution to ( [ eqcomv ] ) .",
    "further , let @xmath92 suppose that @xmath66 and that @xmath67 are integers such that @xmath68 and @xmath93 satisfy @xmath70 .",
    "then letting @xmath94 we have @xmath95    similarly as theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] , theorem  [ thm_hnmlocal ] characterizes the joint limiting distribution of @xmath96 precisely .",
    "once more the limit resembles a bivariate normal distribution , so that we can infer the following central limit theorem .",
    "[ cor_hnmlocal ] keep the notation from  theorem  [ thm_hnmlocal ] .",
    "then @xmath97 converge to the normal distribution with mean @xmath53 and covariance matrix @xmath98 .      as an application of the local limit theorem for @xmath0 ( theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] ) , we obtain the following formula for the asymptotic probability that a random hypergraph @xmath99 is connected , and thus for the number of connected hypergraphs of a given order and size .",
    "[ thm_cnm][thm : cnm ] let @xmath58 be a fixed integer . for any compact set @xmath100 , and for any @xmath61 there exists @xmath101 such that the following holds .",

    "then the there exists a unique number @xmath105 such that @xmath106 let @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath108 finally , let @xmath109 signify the probability that @xmath99 is connected . then for all @xmath110 we have @xmath111 .",
    "to prove theorem  [ thm_cnm ] we shall consider a `` larger '' hypergraph @xmath0 such that the expected order and size of the largest component of @xmath0 are @xmath104 and @xmath112 .",
    "then , we will infer the probability that @xmath99 is conncected from the local limit theorem for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , this proof needs the full strength of theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] ; i.e. , the central limit theorem provided by corollary  [ cor_hnplocal ] is insufficient to obtain theorem  [ thm : cnm ] .",
    "furthermore , we have the following theorem on the asymptotic probability that @xmath113 is connected .",
    "[ thm_cnp][thm : cd ] let @xmath58 be a fixed integer .",

    "then there is a unique @xmath117 such that @xmath118 set @xmath119 , resp .",
    "let @xmath120 then for all @xmath110 the probability @xmath121 satisfies @xmath122 .",
    "interestingly , if we choose @xmath115 and @xmath102 in such a way that @xmath123 for all @xmath104 and set @xmath124 , then the function @xmath125 from theorem  [ thm : cd ] is strictly bigger than @xmath126 from theorem  [ thm : cnm ] .",
    "consequently , the probability that @xmath0 is connected exceeds the probability that @xmath5 is connected by an exponential factor .",
    "the reason is that in @xmath0 the total number of edges is a ( bionmially distributed ) random variable .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath0 `` boosts '' its probability of connectivity by including a number of edges that exceeds @xmath127 considerably .",
    "that is , the total number of edges _ given that @xmath0 is connected _ is significantly bigger than @xmath127 .",
    "the following local limit theorem for the total number of edges in @xmath0 given that @xmath0 is connected quantifies this observation .",

    "suppose that @xmath129 is sequence such that @xmath116 for all @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath117 be the unique solution to ( [ eq : varrho ] ) , and set @xmath130 then for all @xmath131 and all integers @xmath132 such that @xmath133 we have @xmath134    in the case @xmath27 the unique solution to  ( [ eq : varrho ] ) is @xmath135 , whence the formulas from theorem  [ thm_edges ] simplify to @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "bender , canfield , and mckay  @xcite were the first to compute the asymptotic probability that a random graph @xmath33 is connected for _ any _ ratio @xmath138 .",
    "although they employ a probabilistic result from uczak  @xcite to simplify their arguments , their proof is based on enumerative methods . additionally , using their formula for the connectivity probability of @xmath33 , bender , canfield , and mckay  @xcite inferred the probability that @xmath139 is connected as well as a central limit theorem for the number of edges of @xmath139 given connectivity . moreover , it is possible ( though somewhat technical ) to derive local limit theorems for @xmath140 and @xmath141 from the main result of  @xcite .",
    "in fact , pittel and wormald  @xcite recently used enumerative arguments to derive an improved version of the main result of  @xcite and to obtain a local limit theorem that in addition to @xmath73 and @xmath74 also includes the order and size of the @xmath15-core . in summary , in  @xcite enumerative results on the number of connected graphs of a given order and size were used to infer the distributions of @xmath141 and @xmath140 . by contrast , in the present paper we use the converse approach : employing probabilistic methods , we first determine the distributions of @xmath141 and @xmath140 , and from this we derive the number of connected graphs with given order and size .    the asymptotic probability that @xmath139 is connected was first computed by stepanov  @xcite ( this problem is significantly simpler than computing the probability that @xmath33 is connected ) .",
    "he also obtained a local limit theorem for @xmath142 ( but his methods do not yield the joint distribution of @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "moreover , pittel  @xcite derived central limit theorems for @xmath142 and @xmath38 from his result on the joint distribution of the numbers of trees of given sizes outside the giant component .",
    "the arguments in both  @xcite are of enumerative and analytic nature .",
    "furthermore , a few authors have applied probabilistic arguments to problems related to the present work .",
    "for instance , oconnell  @xcite employed the theory of large deviations in order to estimate the probability that @xmath139 is connected up to a factor @xmath144 . while this result is significantly less precise than stepanov s , oconnell s proof is simpler . in addition , barraez , boucheron , and fernandez de la vega  @xcite exploited the analogy between the component structure of @xmath139 and branching processes to derive a central limit theorem for the joint distribution of @xmath142 and the _ total _ number of edges in @xmath139 ; however , their techniques do not yield a _",
    "limit theorem .",
    "finally , spencer and van der hofstad  @xcite used a novel perspective on the branching process argument to rederive the formula of bender , canfield , and mckay  @xcite for the number of connected graphs .",
    "in contrast to the case of graphs ( @xmath27 ) , little is known about the phase transition and the connectivity probability of random @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs with @xmath55 . in fact , to our knowledge the arguments used in all of the aforementioned papers do not extend to the case @xmath55 .",
    "karoski  and uczak  @xcite derived an asymptotic formula for the number of connected @xmath1-uniform hypergraphs of order @xmath2 and size @xmath145 via combinatorial techniques .",
    "since the minimum number of edges necessary for connectivity is @xmath146 , this formula addresses _ sparsely _ connected hypergraphs . using this result ,",
    "karoski  and uczak  @xcite investigated the phase transition in @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "they obtained local limit theorems for the joint distribution of @xmath96 and @xmath80 in the _ early supercritical phase _",
    ", i.e. , their result apply to the case @xmath147 .",
    "furthermore , andriamampianina and ravelomanana  @xcite extended the result from @xcite to the regime @xmath148 via enumerative techniques .",
    "in addition , relying on  @xcite , ravelomanana and rijamamy  @xcite extended  @xcite to @xmath149 .",
    "note that all of these results either deal with _ very sparsely _ connected hypergraphs ( i.e. , @xmath150 ) , or with the _ early _ supercritical phase ( i.e. , @xmath151 ) .",
    "by contrast , the results of this paper concern connected hypergraphs with @xmath152 edges and the component structure of random hypergraphs @xmath5 or @xmath0 with @xmath153 .",
    "thus , our results and those from  @xcite are complementary .",
    "the regime of @xmath6 and @xmath26 that we deal with in the present work was previously studied by coja - oghlan , moore , and sanwalani  @xcite using probabilistic arguments . setting up an analogy between a certain branching process and the component structure of @xmath0 , they computed the expected order and size of the largest component of @xmath0 along with the variance of @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , they computed the probability that @xmath5 or @xmath0 is connected _ up to a constant factor _ , and estimated the _ expected _ number of edges of @xmath0 given connectivity .",
    "note that theorems  [ thm_cnm ] , [ thm_cnp ] , and  [ thm_edges ] enhance these results considerably , as they yield _ tight _ asymptotics for the connectivity probability , respectively the precise limiting distribution of the number of edges given conncectivity .",
    "while the arguments of  @xcite by themselves are not strong enough to yield local limit theorems , combining the branching process arguments with further probabilistic techniques , in  @xcite we inferred a local limit theorem for @xmath56 .",
    "theorems  [ thm_hnplocal ] and  [ thm_hnmlocal ] extend this result by giving local limit theorems for the _ joint _ distribution of @xmath73 and @xmath74 .      to prove theorems  [ thm_hnplocal ] and  [ thm_hnmlocal ] , we build upon a qualitative result on the connected components of @xmath0 from coja - oghlan , moore , and sanwalani  @xcite , and a local limit theorem for @xmath56 from our previous paper  @xcite ( theorems  [ thm_global ] and  [ thm_nlocal ] , cf .  section  [ sec_pre ] ) .",
    "the proofs of both of these ingredients solely rely on probabilistic reasoning ( namely , branching processes and stein s method for proving convergence to a gaussian ) .    in section  [ sec_nmlocal ]",
    "we show that ( somewhat surprisingly ) the _ univariate _ local limit theorem for @xmath56 can be converted into a _ bivariate _ local limit theorem for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . to this end , we observe that the local limit theorem for @xmath56 implies a bivariate local limit theorem for the joint distribution of @xmath56 and the number @xmath154 of edges _ outside _ the largest component .",
    "then , we will set up a relationship between the joint distribution of @xmath155 and that of @xmath156 .",
    "since we already know the distribution of @xmath155 , we will be able to infer the joint distribution of @xmath156 via fourier analysis .",
    "as in @xmath5 the _ total _ number of edges is fixed ( namely , @xmath6 ) , we have @xmath157 . hence",
    ", we obtain a local limit theorem for the joint distribution of @xmath96 , i.e. , theorem  [ thm_hnmlocal ] .",
    "finally , theorem  [ thm_hnmlocal ] easily implies theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] .",
    "we consider this fourier analytic approach for proving the bivariate local limit theorems the main contribution of the present work .",
    "furthermore , in section  [ sect : cnm ] we derive theorem  [ thm_cnm ] from theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ] .",
    "the basic reason why this is possible is that _ given _ that the largest component of @xmath0 has order @xmath104 and size @xmath112 , this component is a uniformly distributed random hypergraph with these parameters .",
    "indeed , this observation was also exploited by uczak  @xcite to estimate the number of connected graphs up to a polynomial factor , and in  @xcite , where an explicit relation between the numbers @xmath158 and @xmath159 was derived ( cf .",
    "lemma  [ lemma_cnmaux ] below ) . combining this relation with theorem  [ thm_hnplocal ]",
