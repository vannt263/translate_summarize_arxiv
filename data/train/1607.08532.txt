    "dynamics of confined collective excitations in nonlinear physical systems , modeled by one or several fields , is determined by the interplay of the field - trapping potential and the character of interactions of the field(s ) .",

    "a generic type of the latter is represented by double - well potentials ( dwps ) , which feature symmetry between two wells separated by a barrier .    in quantum mechanics @xcite and linear",
    "field theories mathematically similar to it , such as paraxial light propagation in linear optical waveguides @xcite , the ground state ( gs ) of a confined system normally follows the symmetry of the trapping potential ( the jahn - teller effect in molecules exemplifies another possibility , when the gs of the electron wave function in the complex system is spatially asymmetric , thus breaking the symmetry of the full hamiltonian @xcite ) . other representations of the same symmetry may be realized by the system s excited states .",
    "thus , the gs wave function trapped in the one - dimensional dwp is symmetric ( even ) with respect to the double - well structure , while the first excited state is antisymmetric ( odd ) .    unlike the linear quantum - mechanical schrdinger equation for a single particle , atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )",

    "a fundamental difference from the linear systems is that the gs in the self - focusing models follows the symmetry of the underlying potential structure only if the nonlinearity remains relatively weak .",
    "a generic effect , which occurs with the increase of the strength of the nonlinearity as a result of its interplay with the dwp , is _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ ( ssb ) , which destabilizes the symmetric gs and replaces it by an asymmetric one @xcite .",

    ", the ssb means that larger light power spontaneously self - traps in either core of the nonlinear dual - core waveguide .",

    "in particular , the symmetry breaking for a pair of laser beams coupled into a transverse dwp created in a self - focusing photorefractive medium was demonstrated in ref .",

    "however , stability of the antisymmetric mode against antisymmetry - breaking perturbations may be altered in the presence of the barrier .",
    "we have addressed this issue by means of the numerical analysis , replacing the ideal @xmath22-function by its regularized counterpart ( [ delta ] ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , it was found that the odd  modes are stable if their norm is small enough , and become unstable when @xmath81 exceeds a certain critical value ; however , the instability is oscillatory , not being related to any antisymmetry - breaking bifurcation .",

    "[ fig11 ] , with a typical scenario of the evolution of an unstable one presented in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",

    "[ fig13 ] , which shows their instability threshold ( in terms of the norm ) versus @xmath0 .",
    "it is seen that the stability interval of the odd modes is smallest ( @xmath170 ) in the absence of the splitting barrier , i.e. , at @xmath120 .",
    "the increase of @xmath0 leads to expansion of the stability range , which may be explained by dint of the following argument .",
    "in the case when both @xmath0 and @xmath81 are large , the odd mode may be considered as a superposition of two narrow half - solitons ( [ sol ] ) , with norms @xmath171 , opposite signs , and centers located at opposite points , @xmath172 . because the energy of the free soliton , determined by eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , is @xmath173 , the instability of the odd state against the merger of the two half - solitons into a single one with norm @xmath81 , placed in either half - box ( i.e. , the instability against the breaking of the antisymmetry ) , is driven by the respective energy difference , @xmath174 . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ barrier ] ) suggests that , to pass the separating hurdle on the way to the merger , a half - soliton must overcome an energy barrier of height @xmath175 .",
    "thus , the value of the norm at the instability threshold may be estimated , from condition @xmath176 , as @xmath177 .",
    "eventually , in the in the limit of @xmath73 , the infinitely tall barrier splits the potential box into two isolated ones , each lobe of the odd mode carrying over into a stable gs ( ground state ) of the half - box , which implies that @xmath178 at @xmath179 .",
    ".,width=307 ]    because the odd modes are stable at sufficiently small values of @xmath81 , it makes sense to compare their stability region with that of their symmetric and asymmetric counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig14](a ) presents the comparison for @xmath180 .",
    "further , to identify the system s gs , fig .",
    "[ fig14](b ) displays the comparison of their hamiltonian values as functions of the norm .",
    "the hamiltonian is calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , in which the last term is replaced as per eq .",
    "( [ delta]):@xmath181it is clearly seen that the odd mode is always an excited state , whose hamiltonian exceeds that of the coexisting ( for the same @xmath81 ) stable symmetric or asymmetric mode . thus , the symmetric state , when it is stable , and the asymmetric one , when it exists , represent the gs .",
    "lastly , we have also carried out a brief analysis for the second excited state , i.e. , the first even state existing above the gs . as well as",
    "the gs , this mode undergoes the ssb , which gives rise , above the respective bifurcation point , to coexisting symmetric and asymmetric versions of the second excited state , see a typical example in figs .",
    "[ fig14](a , b ) .",
    "however , a drastic difference from the gs is that not only the formally existing symmetric mode , but also the coexisting asymmetric one , produced by the ssb , is unstable , as shown in figs . [ fig14](c ) . as a result of its evolution",
    ", the unstable asymmetric second - order state spontaneously evolves towards a stable asymmetric gs which exists at the same norm .",
    "the objective of this work is to carry out the systematic analysis of the basic  one - dimensional model which is capable to grasp the ssb ( spontaneous symmetry breaking ) phenomenology .",
    "the model , which may be realized in becand nonlinear optics alike , is built as the infinitely deep potential box , which is split into two wells by a narrow ( delta - functional ) barrier set at the center .",
    "the barrier s strength , @xmath0 , is the single free parameter in the scaled version of the model .",
    "the ssb is predicted in it by means of two analytical approximations , which are valid in two limit cases , _",
    "viz_. ,  for strong or weak splitting of the potential box by the central barrier . another semi - analytical approach , based on the va ( variational approximation ) , has been developed in the generic case .",
    "predictions of the analytical approximations have been verified by means of comparison with systematically generated numerical results .",
    "it is inferred that the system always gives rise to the supercritical ssb bifurcation of the gs ( ground state ) .",
    "the va accurately predicts this finding at moderate values of @xmath0 , but fails to do it at small @xmath0 , due to the limited applicability of the underlying _",
    "ansatz_. however , the other analytical approximation for small @xmath0 , which is based on the soliton ansatz , correctly describes that case .",
    "in addition to the gs , the stability of the first and second excited states was investigated too .",
    "the former one ( a spatially odd mode ) is destabilized at a critical value of the norm .",
    "the second - order excited state , as well as the gs , features the ssb bifurcation , but , unlike the gs , the asymmetric mode produced by this bifurcation is unstable . in direct simulations ,",
    "all unstable modes tend to rearrange themselves into the symmetry - broken gs with the same norm .    as an extension of the work",
    ", it may be interesting to consider its two - dimensional version , for a square - shaped infinitely deep potential box , split by appropriate inner barriers , a new factor appearing in two dimensions being a possibility of the collapse of the trapped modes .",
