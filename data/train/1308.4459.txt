    "there have been six recent detections of transient radio bursts whose dispersion measures ( dms ) are so large that their emission has been suggested to originate at cosmological distances ( lorimer et al.2007 ; keane et al.2010 ; thornton et al.2013 ) .",
    "a substantial fraction of the dms of these bursts are attributed to baryons in the diffuse inter - galactic medium , heralding the possibility of probing the entire baryonic content of the universe out to which these bursts can be detected .",
    "measurement of the dispersion delay as a function of frequency enables direct measurement of the total electron column along the line of sight , and for @xmath10 the contribution of the igm is expected to dominate the total dm of objects viewed through lines of sight off the galactic plane ( ioka 2003 ; inoue 2004 ) .",
    "the existence of such bright , short - duration transients makes it possible to probe the ionized igm at cosmological distances in exquisite detail .",
    "impulsive extragalactic radio bursts offer the prospect of measuring the turbulent properties of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "turbulent plasma along the line of sight can scatter the radiation , which alters the temporal profile of the burst as it propagates through intergalactic plasma .",
    "the effect of temporal smearing caused by scattering potentially reveals information on the igm on exquisitely fine scales , down to lengths as small as @xmath11 m .",
    "temporal smearing arises due to multipath propagation as the radiation travels through inhomogeneities in the turbulent plasma .",
    "radiation scattered back into the line of sight is delayed relative to radiation that arrives along the direct line of sight to a source , with the amount of radiation scattered depending on the typical angle through which it is scattered .",
    "this angle , and hence the amount of delayed radiation , increases with the strength of the scattering .",
    "thus both the apparent angular diameter and the temporal profile of a compact transient source depend on the amount and distribution of turbulent intergalactic plasma along the line of sight .",
    "there is strong evidence that the radiation from these extragalactic bursts is subject to scattering at intergalactic distances . in two out of the six reported cases",
    "the burst duration increases sharply with wavelength across the observing band , scaling as @xmath12 ( lorimer et al.2007 ; thornton et al.2013 )",
    ". this scaling is characteristic of radiation subject to temporal broadening caused by turbulent plasma .",
    "the reported smearing times are of order milliseconds , much larger than the microsecond timescales expected of temporal smearing expected due to the turbulence in our own galaxy along the lines of sight on which these bursts are observed .",
    "the expected smearing time of the lorimer burst , if due to galactic scattering alone , is @xmath13s , far smaller than the observed width of @xmath14ms .",
    "this raises the prospect that radiation from these bursts contains information on turbulence in the ionized igm and even in the host galaxy .",
    "there are two main reasons to compute the effect of temporal smearing due to the igm .",
    "firstly , it affects searches for short - duration transients at sufficiently low frequency .",
    "the steep scale of the temporal smearing timescale with frequencies raises the possibility that searches for transients at low frequencies are particularly susceptible to the effects of temporal smearing . unlike dispersion smearing , temporal smearing due to multipath propagation results in an irretrievable loss of sensitivity to transients when the smearing time exceeds the intrinsic burst duration , with the observed s / n decreasing by the square - root of the factor over which the smearing time exceeds the intrinsic pulse duration .    secondly , at higher frequencies , where temporal smearing is a smaller hindrance to the detection of transient sources but is still measurable , the effect affords a means of probing the evolution of the igm itself .",
    "this is attractive because it furnishes a means of probing the history of energy deposition in the igm .",
    "the sources invoked to explain reionization of the universe and feedback associated with galaxy formation inject energy into the igm on large scales , driving a turbulent cascade that should drive the evolution of inhomogeneity in the igm .",
    "sources of energy input include the radiative and mechanical energy of agn and their jets , the uv and x - ray emission and stellar winds from young stars and the flows driven by supernovae ( cen & ostriker 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the subject of intergalactic scattering is coming to the fore with the inevitability of detecting many more extragalactic transients in the near future .",
    "several radio arrays with wide fields of view ( @xmath15sq.deg . ) ideally suited to the detection of large numbers of short - duration transient sources are currently entering operation or being planned .",
    "these telescopes span the frequency range 30mhz to 3ghz and include lofar , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; tingay et al .",
    "2013 ) , askap ( johnston et al .",
    "2007 ) , meerkat and , eventually , the ska .",
    "specific surveys for fast transients are planned on many of these , including the lofar transients key project ( stappers et al .",
    "2011 ) , the commensal real - time askap fast transients survey ( craft ; macquart et al.2010 ) , and the transients and pulsars with meerkat survey ( trapum ; pis stappers and kramer ) .    the parkes high time resolution universe legacy survey ( htru ; keith et al.2010 ) , even with a comparatively small field of view , has shown that the rate of impulsive radio extragalactic transient events is large .",
    "the detection of the four high - dm pulses so far implies an event rate @xmath16sky@xmath17day@xmath17 at 1.4ghz above 1jy ( thornton et al . 2013 . ) .",
    "the high luminosity of the events detected so far from inferred redshifts of @xmath18 suggests that it is relatively easy to detect bursts out to redshifts with lookback times to a significant fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "this rate may be augmented from other types of yet - undetected events , such as those postulated to be generated by coherent radio emission associated with the initial explosions of grbs ( usov & katz 2000 , sagiv & waxman 2002 , moortgat & kuijpers 2004 ) .",
    "should they be detected in great enough numbers , the combination of dm and scattering information gleaned from transients may enable tomographic reconstruction of the structure and turbulent properties of the baryonic component of the universe .",
    "this is akin to the manner in which pulsar measurements have been used to map out the structure of our galaxy s own interstellar medium ( e.g. armstrong , rickett & spangler 1995 ; taylor & cordes 1993 ; cordes & lazio ne2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we relate the temporal smearing of radio transients to the underlying properties of the igm . in ",
    "2 we outline the relationship between angular broadening and temporal smearing due to scattering to the turbulent properties of a plasma located at cosmological distances .",
    "the aim of this section is to furnish the means by which future transients detections may be used to reverse engineer the structure of the igm . in ",
    "3 we explore simple models for turbulence in the igm and show how the magnitude of scattering effects would be expected to scale with redshift under several simple scenarios . in ",
    "4 we discuss existing limits and properties of igm turbulence based on measurements to date .",
    "we conclude in  5 with a summary of the means by which these effects may be used as a cosmological tool to probe the history of energy deposition into the igm .",
    "we consider the effects of scattering under the simplifying assumption that the inhomogeneities associated with the plasma are confined to a single plane .",
    "the thin - screen approximation provides an accurate description of the scattering properties if the line of sight is dominated by a single turbulent region .",
    "however the range of validity of this commonly - used approximation extends further because it is often possible to model the effects of an extended medium in terms of an equivalent thin - screen after appropriate adjustment of simple parameters , such as the screen distance and scattering strength ( see tatarski & zavorotnyi ( 1980 ) and lee & jokipii ( 1975 ) in the context of temporal smearing ) .",
    "the thin - screen formalism elucidates the essential physics of the scattering without the hindrance of the extra mathematical formalism required to exhaustively treat a scattering in an extended medium .",
    "the observed wavefield of a point - like source of unit amplitude emanating at cosmological distances with angular diameter distance @xmath19 and subject to phase fluctuations on a plane located an angular diameter distance @xmath20 from an observer is ( schneider et al .",

    "however , the foregoing definition of the scattering measure is inappropriate for objects that are part of the hubble flow , where the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric applies . for a scattering medium that is extended along the line of sight , but in which the thin - screen formalism ( i.e. eq.([ugrav ] ) ) still applies in an approximate sense ( see the discussion in codona et al.1986 ) , the redshift of the scattering , @xmath24 , changes continuously , and eqns.([rdiffdefn ] ) need to be generalized to take this into account . furthermore , the integral over path length @xmath48 needs to be specified in such a way that it accounts for the geometry of the universe . in defining the effective scattering measure , @xmath53 for a medium that extends between redshifts @xmath54 and @xmath55 , it is useful to absorb the denominator @xmath56 into the definition of the scattering measure and refer all quantities back to the observer s frame so that , @xmath57 where we measure distances in terms of light travel time so that @xmath58 and where , @xmath59^{-1/2 } , \\label{dhubble}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the hubble radius for a @xmath60 universe . in this manner one can still use eqns.([rdiffdefn ] ) provided one makes the replacement @xmath61 .    for the purposes of numerically computing the magnitude of angular and temporal broadening , we provide numerical expressions for @xmath62 for @xmath44 :    @xmath63      the effect of angular broadening due to plasma turbulence",

    "thus the solution for the smearing timescale proceeds analogously to the euclidean solution presented in goodman & narayan ( 1989 ; gn89 ) .",

    "the temporal smearing timescale for a given @xmath79 depends additionally on the location of the scattering plasma along the line of sight to the source which is , a priori , unknown .",
    "numerically , one may express the temporal smearing timescale in terms of the ratio of angular diameter distances @xmath85 and the parameters of the turbulence :    @xmath86    [ tauempirical ]",
    "one may regard the theory of angular broadening and temporal smearing at cosmological distances presented in the previous section primarily as a means to reverse - engineer the structure of the turbulent igm .",
    "however , it is instructive to consider the relative contribution that various scattering regions embedded in the igm may make to the overall amplitude of the scattering .",
    "it is also illuminating to compare these estimates to the amplitude of the scattering implied by the temporal smearing observed in the six lorimer bursts detected to date .",

    "it is plausibly between 0.001pc , a scale typically observed in interstellar turbulence ( armstrong , rickett & spangler 1995 ) , and 0.1mpc , the scale of the agn jets that deposit energy into the igm .",

    "the statistics used , however , do not account for the fact that extragalactic transient sources are more likely to be detected within a large cluster of galaxies , or that searches for extragalactic transients will most likely be directed towards galaxies or galaxy clusters .",
    "the ionized material associated with lyman-@xmath87 systems potentially contributes to the scattering of extragalactic sources .",
    "the magnitude of this contribution was investigated by rickett et al.(2007 ) , whose results we briefly summarize for completeness here .",
    "they used the haardt - madau cosmological model for reionization by the uv background ( haardt & madau 1996 ) , and assume reionization equilibrium , to infer the electron densities of photoionized gas associated with lyman - alpha clouds , whose hi column densities are well studied over a wide range of redshifts ( prochaska et al.2005 ; janknecht et al .",

    "these clouds are assumed to have fully developed turbulence with a kolmogorov spectrum . applying the thin screen scattering model , and summing over the scattering contributions of all clouds in the line of sight , they predict angular broadening of order @xmath173as up to @xmath174 at 5 ghz , for cloud sizes of order @xmath175 kpc .",
    "based on the relation in equation  [ tauuse ] , this translates to temporal smearing timescales of order @xmath172 to @xmath176s at 5 ghz , depending on the locations of the scattering clouds , and @xmath172 ms to @xmath177 ms at 1 ghz , which are comparable to that of the other components already discussed , as well as the limits imposed by the lorimer bursts , which we discuss below .",
    "to supplement the foregoing estimates , we also consider an alternate empirical approach based on attempts to relate dispersion measure and scattering measure .",
    "an empirical relation between dm and sm is observed in turbulent astrophysical plasmas in the interstellar medium ( bhat et al .",
    "2004 ) , and it is therefore useful to consider how this relationship might relate to turbulence in intergalactic plasmas .",
    "this approach holds practical appeal because the dispersion measure is a fundamental measureable of any implusive cosmological transient , and a relation between sm and dm would suggest a characteristic dm out to which scattering may begin to assert its importance in limiting the detectability of extragalactic transients .    following the formalism of cordes et al . (",
    "1991 ) and bhat et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , one may consider the igm to be comprised of a collection of scattering clouds in which the respective dm and sm increments associated with a scattering cloud of depth @xmath178 are @xmath179 where @xmath180 takes the value 1.84m@xmath181@xmath182 if we assume a kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence , and where @xmath178 is expressed in kpc , @xmath139 in @xmath131 , dm in kpc@xmath131 and sm is expressed in its usual units of kp@xmath2 .",
    "the dimensionless fluctuation parameter is defined by @xmath183 where @xmath40 is the outer scale of the turbulence , @xmath184 is the volume filling factor of the turbulent medium , and @xmath185 measures the amplitude of density fluctuations within the cloud relative to its mean value , and @xmath186 is a measure of fluctuations in the mean density between clouds .",
    "this implies the following relation between increments in dm and sm , @xmath187 where the fluctuation parameter is found to lie in the range @xmath188 for turbulence in the interstellar medium of our galaxy ( cordes & lazio 2002 ( ne2001 ) ) .",
    "the extension of this formalism to an intergalactic context involves two modifications which alter the ratio of the sm to the dm .",
    "the mean density of the igm ( @xmath189@xmath131 ) is much lower relative to the ism ( @xmath190@xmath131 ) , so that a given dispersion measure variation is expected to produce an sm contribution that is a fraction @xmath191 of that expected in the ism .",

    "the range of values implied by this approximation is consistent with the order of magnitude of the sm computed by other means in previous subsections .",
    "the lower amplitude of scattering per unit dm suggests that level of temporal smearing experienced by extragalactic bursts is substantially lower than may be expected on the basis of extrapolation from the dm - sm relationship observed in the ism , and there thus are excellent prospects of detecting extragalactic bursts out to high redshifts .    the sm estimate based on the detection of temporal smearing in frb 110220 , as discussed above ,",
    "may be used to provide a tentative estimate of @xmath193 in the igm . for this burst",
    ", we use @xmath200 ( thornton et al .",
    "2013 ) to find @xmath201 .",
    "this value is similar to that obtained in highly turbulent regions of the ism , and it suggests that the outer turbulent scale may not be dissimilar from that found in interstellar environments .",

    "the most stringent observational limits come from vlbi and from the minimum source angular sizes of sources as deduced by interstellar scintillation at cm - wavelengths .",
    "the strongest vlbi limits are at the lowest frequencies since the expected angular broadening size increases quadratically with wavelength but the resolution of an interferometer degrades only linearly with wavelength .",
    "however , the limit on igm angular broadening at @xmath7 is well beyond the resolving capabilities of vlbi : baselines larger than @xmath210 km are required at 300mhz to access sources at the angular resolutions relevant to igm angular broadening . at higher frequencies constraints from iss are more stringent .",

    "we may also utiliize the angular sizes of intra - day variable sources to place upper limits on the effective scattering measure in the igm at moderate redshifts .",
    "the @xmath213 source j1819@xmath2143845 , contains components between 9 and 26@xmath215as in size at 5ghz ( macquart & de bruyn 2007 ) .",

    "2002 ) , which places an identical limit on the effective scattering measure at @xmath220 .      the temporal characteristics of the six extragalactic bursts reported by lorimer et al.(2007 ) , keane et al.(2011 ) and thornton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) may be used to further constrain the properties of scattering over cosmological distances .",
    "temporal smearing was detected in only two bursts , and only the detection of the highest s / n event reported by thornton et al.(2013 ) was not of marginal significance : this burst , frb 110220 , possessed a ( smearing - dominated ) duration of @xmath221ms duration at 1.3ghz .",
    "no significant detection of scattering was made in other bursts , placing limits on the smearing timescale of between between @xmath222ms and @xmath223ms at the same frequency .",
    "moreover , we note that the upper limit on the dm@xmath224pc@xmath131 , @xmath225ms duration burst ( frb 110703 ) is smaller than the duration of frb 110220 , despite occurring at the lower dm of @xmath226pc@xmath131 .",
    "this indicates that there is appreciable variation in the smearing timescale of extragalactic bursts between different lines of sight .",

    "the frequency dependence of the temporal smearing observed in frb 110220 , @xmath227 is consistent with both scattering in which @xmath75 ( @xmath228 ) or in which @xmath78 ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "since the observed pulse shape is the convolution of the intrinsic pulse shape with the pulse broadening kernel , we attribute 4ms to the temporal smearing timescale in frb 110220 , which implies the following @xmath230 this may be regarded as an upper limit on the effective scattering measure of the igm in the sense that some component of the temporal smearing may originate in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "more generally , the absence of broadening in the other bursts implies @xmath231 the scattering is particularly constraining for frbs 110627 and 120127 , with durations of @xmath232ms and @xmath222ms respectively ( thornton et al.2013 ) .",
    "the extension of the scattering theory above to cosmological distances allows us to immediately address an important issue related to the origin of scattering in high - dm lorimer - like bursts .",
    "specifically , in several high - dm bursts the pulse width is observed to increase as @xmath12 , which suggests that these pulses are broadened by multipath propagation by an inhomogeneous plasma along the lines of sight to the objects . for the case of the lorimer",
    "burst itself , the predicted temporal smearing time due to our galaxy s interstellar medium is @xmath233s at 1.4ghz ( cordes & lazio 2002 ) , which is much smaller than the observed @xmath234ms pulse duration .",
    "thus the scattering occurs either in the igm or in the host galaxy of the burst itself .",
    "there is currently considerable debate about whether the observed temporal smearing is caused by the igm , or whether it can be fully attributed to turbulence in the interstellar medium of the galaxy in which the burst occured ( the host galaxy ) .",
    "the foregoing theory makes a strong prediction about the redshift dependence of the scattering at cosmological distances .",
    "this potentially enables us to distinguish between temporal smearing predominately due to the host galaxy or the igm itself .",
    "if the scattering is dominated by turbulent plasma inside the host galaxy , the sm will reflect local conditions within those galaxies and will be decoupled from the hubble expansion that affects the density of the diffuse igm .",

    "it should be emphasised that this distinction applies only in a statistical sense , in that there is likely to be considerable variation between the scattering properties of bursts .",
    "for instance , one expects some variation in the sm of the host galaxy depending on its orientation relative to the line of sight .",
    "the scattering of the host galaxy is more likely to dominate over the igm contribution on occasions when the burst is viewed edge - on through the host galaxy .",
    "however , the fraction of bursts in which orientation plays a strong role is likely to be small .",
