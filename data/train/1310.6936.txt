    ". however , many asteroids have very inclined orbits , attributed to scattering by planets or to the kozai mechanism ( dynamical exchange of high eccentricities and inclinations ) . such effects are of renewed interest with the discovery of extremely inclined orbits of some extrasolar planets , including cases so extreme as to be retrograde ( e.g. brown et al .",

    "these bodies are observed in transit , where the occulting planet blocks starlight with specific doppler shifts ( the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ) . it is widely thought that perturbations from more distant ( unseen ) planets allow the kozai mechanism to operate , or lead to mutual scattering , and potentially tidal orbital circularisation and stellar spin - axis reorientation ( winn et al .",

    "it has been proposed that interaction of the magnetic field of a young star with its circumstellar disc could tip the star ( foucart & lai 2011 ; lai et al .",
    "alternatively , external accretion could give a randomised final angular momentum vector to the disc ( bate et al .",
    "2010 ) , or encounters with another disc / envelope system could cause dynamical perturbation ( thies et al .",
    "evidence of such events could be found much later , for main - sequence stars where belts of planetesimals have formed from the circumstellar discs , as collisions generate debris that produces thermal emission at infrared and longer wavelengths .",
    "further , where planets have been imaged or detected by astrometry , the inclinations of the orbital and belt planes can be compared to the stellar equator .",
    "results of star - disc alignment studies are so far sparse .",

    "( 2004 ) noted that the nearby old solar - analogue @xmath3  ceti appeared to have a rather edge - on debris disc while the star s small projected rotational velocity ( @xmath4 ) suggested a more pole - on aspect .",

    "we fitted model discs to estimate inclinations with respect to the sky plane , so e.g. an @xmath8 disc is face - on ( while an @xmath9 star is pole - on ) .",

    "stars seen nearly side - on are suggested when @xmath4 approaches the maximum value for the spectral type , but this also has poor accuracy and is subject to the assumption that stars of a given spectral type have a maximum spin rate .",

    "estimates of @xmath15 can also be made from models of asteroseismological data and/or rotation of spot patterns , as some surface features can only be seen in certain orientations .",

    "the primary method remains the classic approach of campbell & garrison ( 1985 ) , yielding inclination of the stellar pole with respect to the line of sight when true rotation velocity can be compared to @xmath4 .",
    "this gives @xmath20 where stellar rotation period @xmath21 is in days , projected rotation velocity @xmath4 is in km / s and stellar radius @xmath22 is in solar radii .",

    "is from @xmath25 minus its error .    projected rotational velocities of stars are found by fitting their spectral lines , with modest differences between methods and calibration systems that have been well characterised by gbocki & gnaciski ( 2005a ) . here",
    "we compile values from gbocki & gnaciski ( 2005b ) plus @xmath4 data from the subsequent literature , including a comprehensive study made for dunes ( martnez - arniz et al .",
    "2010 ) , thus adding up to 6 more measurements per star .",
    "the gbocki & gnaciski ( 2005b ) method of merging calibrations was not reproduced , but the weights @xmath26 they attribute to different methods of line fitting were adopted .",

    "overall , some differences in @xmath4 between different catalogues were confirmed ; omitting particular datasets shifts the means by up to @xmath32 the standard error .",
    "periods @xmath21 are found from tracking variability associated with surface inhomogeneities , such as the data obtained under the long - running mount wilson project .",
    "such results are sparse , and limit our analysis to 9 nearby late - type ( f9m3 ) stars .",
    "uncertainties and intrinsic variations in @xmath21 are generally recorded as small , at @xmath75  % .",
    "hartman et al . (",
    "2011 ) investigated reliability of period extraction in a star survey including by dra rotational variables ( including hd  166 , hd  30495 , @xmath19  eri , gj  581 and au mic here ) , and only the latter two m - stars have amplitudes in the 0.01 - 0.02  mag range that is of concern .",

    "( 2013 ) discuss how @xmath15 can be robust if it is small .",
    "an advantage of observed periods is that spin - down for solar - type stars is rather well understood ( barnes 2007 ) , and so ` gyrochronology ' ages have be found ( vican et al .",
    "2012 ) ; this confirmed the unbiased nature of our survey targets .",

    "star - disc inclination differences @xmath37 are typically close to zero , albeit with large errors where @xmath4 is low . in the seven best - defined cases ,",
    "the star - disc systems appear co - planar within 5@xmath11 on average , with only the vega system potentially misaligned ( by @xmath38 ) .",
    "this small tilt would be similar to the sun s inclination versus the kuiper belt , which for an external observer in an ecliptic co - ordinate frame would be @xmath39 .",
    "a potentially misaligned system is the planet - host hr  8799 , which has only a lower limit to @xmath15 from asteroseismology and @xmath40 ; if the star is far from pole - on it will not be co - planar with the disc .",
    "the survey outcome is similar to the null result of watson et al .",

    "the joint sample now covers 16 stars with useful @xmath37 values , with three - quarters of these now observed uniformly by herschel .",
    "given the null results , no stellar property ( table  1 ) is noteworthy  unlike the situation for close - in planets , where e.g. a link with the proportion of the star that is convective has been suggested ( winn et al .",
    "2010 ) . for completeness",
    ", we note that a binary - star system is known with a highly misaligned ( circumpolar ) debris disc ( kennedy et al .",
    "2012 ) , but here our stars are single , except for the spectroscopic binary hd  131511 .    to assess any _",
    "mean _ tilt present , we use the measure @xmath41 , which diverges from unity if the disc and star are misaligned .",
    "this is more statistically convenient than @xmath37 , as measurement errors in @xmath25 and @xmath10 can be assumed to be normally distributed .",
    "the errors can be written as @xmath42 and @xmath43 and combined quadratically .",
    "the mean value of @xmath41 ( excluding the sun ) is then 1.06 with a standard error of @xmath44 , consistent with no misalignment at the 1.5@xmath33 level .",
    "figure  2 illustrates this by plotting @xmath45 for the whole sample .",
    "the value obtained for a particular star - disc tilt depends on viewing angle , and the over - plotted curves illustrate example relative tilts . these curves at @xmath12",
    "encompass all plotted stars within their errors , suggesting the mean tilt is within this range .",
    "the generally good alignment of stars with their debris discs is in marked contrast to the situation for close - in planets .",
    "the cases can not be absolutely compared , because transit data yield inclination differences up to 180@xmath11 , versus a 0 - 90@xmath11 range for disc - star alignment , while neither method is fully 3-d ( lacking the orientation of the stellar pole ) . however , approximately a third of rossiter - mclaughlin detections have @xmath37 of 30 - 150@xmath11 , for example ( brown et al .",

    "generally , models where external encounters affect the alignment of outer components of the system ( bate et al . 2011",

    "<S> many nearby main - sequence stars have been searched for debris using the far - infrared _ herschel _ satellite , within the debris , dunes and guaranteed - time key projects . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss here 11 stars of spectral types a to m where the stellar inclination is known and can be compared to that of the spatially - resolved dust belts . </S>",
    "<S> the discs are found to be well aligned with the stellar equators , as in the case of the sun s kuiper belt , and unlike many close - in planets seen in transit surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the ensemble of stars here can be fitted with a star - disc tilt of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that proposed mechanisms for tilting the star or disc in fact operate rarely . </S>",
    "<S> a few systems also host imaged planets , whose orbits at tens of au are aligned with the debris discs , contrary to what might be expected in models where external perturbers induce tilts .    [ firstpage ]    planetary systems  </S>",
