    "the development of self - consistent microscopic many - body mean field theories aimed on the description of low - energy nuclear phenomena provides necessary theoretical tools for an exploration of the nuclear chart into know and unknown regions .",
    "this development is motivated by theoretical and experimental reasons .",
    "compared with conventional approaches such as , for example , the macroscopic+microscopic method , self - consistent theories rely on a smaller number of assumptions and start from a more microscopic level .",
    "for example , the starting point of non - relativistic mean field theories is an effective interaction between nucleons constituting the nucleus .",
    "such theories based either on zero range skyrme forces or finite range gogny forces have been widely used starting from seventies .",
    "the next step is replacing the schrdinger equation by the dirac equation and thus considering the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite . in rmf theory ,",
    "the nucleus is described as a system of point - like nucleons , dirac spinors , which interact in a phenomenological way by the exchange of mesons , such as the @xmath1-meson responsible for the large scalar attraction at intermediate distances , the @xmath2-meson for the vector repulsion at short distances and the @xmath3-meson for the asymmetry properties of nuclei with large neutron or proton excess .",
    "such a description has a clear advantage that the spin - orbit splitting , which plays an extremely important role in low - energy nuclear physics , emerges in a natural way as a genuine relativistic effect .",
    "in addition , the pseudo - spin symmetry , the origin of which was a long - standing puzzle , does find a natural explanation in the framework of rmf theory @xcite .",
    "rmf theory has been extremely successful also in the description of many other facets of low - energy nuclear physics , such as ground state properties , giant resonances , superdeformed rotating nuclei etc .",
    ", see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "since the discovery of the first superdeformed rotational ( sd ) band in @xmath4dy @xcite , the investigation of superdeformation at high angular momentum remains one of the most challenging topics of nuclear structure .",
    "the rich variety of physical phenomena at superdeformed shapes is based on a complicated and rather subtle interplay of collective and single - particle properties .",
    "although at the present stage , a general understanding of this phenomenon has been achieved , there are still many unresolved questions related , for example , to the phenomenon of identical bands and to the treatment of pairing correlations . in addition , the microscopic theoretical models used so far are still far from a precise quantitative description of sd bands which indicates the necessity of further improvements .",
    "different theoretical methods based mainly on the concept of the cranking model of inglis @xcite have been employed for the quantitative description of various high - spin phenomena at sd shapes , see for example recent overviews in refs .",
    "@xcite . the cranked version of the rmf theory - the cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) theory @xcite is amongst the most successful ones .",
    "it has been applied in a systematic way to the description of sd bands in different mass regions such as @xmath5 @xcite , @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite . pairing correlations",
    "are expected to be considerably quenched in sd bands of these regions at high spin and thus they have been neglected in all studies quoted above .",
    "one should clearly recognize that the neglect of pairing correlations is an approximation because pairing correlations being weak are still present even at the highest rotational frequencies . despite this a very successful description of many properties of sd bands , such as dynamic @xmath8 and kinematic @xmath9 moments of inertia , absolute and relative charge quadrupole moments , effective alignments @xmath10 , single - particle properties in the sd minimum etc .",
    ", has been obtained in these studies in an unpaired formalism .",
    "however , the rotational properties of nuclei at low and medium spin are strongly affected by pairing correlations . in order to describe such properties within the relativistic framework",
    ", we have developed the cranked relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( crhb ) theory .",
    "this theory is an extension of crmf theory to the description of pairing correlations in rotating nuclei .",
    "the brief outline of this theory and its application to the study of several yrast sd bands observed in the @xmath0 mass region has been reported in ref .",
    "the present manuscript represents an extension of this investigation where both the theoretical formalism and the calculations will be presented in much greater details .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section [ sect - crhb ] a detailed description of the crhb theory without and with approximate particle number projection by means of the lipkin - nogami method and some of the specific features of the present calculations are presented .",
    "the shell structure in the @xmath0 mass region of superdeformation and the impact of pairing and particle number projection on the rotational and deformation properties of rotating nuclei are investigated in detail on the example of the lowest sd bands in @xmath11hg and @xmath12pb nuclei in section [ sect - pair ] . in section [ par - dep ]",
    ", we study the dependence of the results of crhb calculations with particle number projection on the parametrization of the rmf lagrangian and the gogny force using sd bands in @xmath12hg and @xmath12pb as an example .",
    "the properties of yrast sd bands observed so far in even - even nuclei of the @xmath0 mass region are systematically studied in section [ systematic ] .",
    "finally , section [ conclusions ] summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "in relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory the nucleus is described as a system of point - like nucleons , dirac spinors , coupled to mesons and to the photons .",
    "the nucleons interact by the exchange of several mesons , namely a scalar meson @xmath1 and three vector particles @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the photon .",
    "the isoscalar - scalar @xmath13-mesons provide a strong intermediate range attraction between the nucleons .",
    "for the three vector particles we have to distinguish the time - like components and the spatial components .",
    "for the photons this means the coulomb field and possible magnetic field in the case where currents play a role . for the isoscalar - vector @xmath2-meson",
    "the time - like component provides a very strong repulsion at short distances for all combinations of particles , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for the isovector - vector @xmath3-meson",
    "the time - like components give rise to a short range repulsion for like particles ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and a short range attraction for unlike particles ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "they also have a strong influence on the symmetry energy .",
    "in addition , the spatial components of the @xmath2 and @xmath3-mesons lead to an interaction between possible currents , which are for the @xmath2-meson attractive for all combinations ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16-currents ) and for the @xmath3-meson attractive for @xmath14 and @xmath15-currents but repulsive for @xmath16-currents .",
    "we have to keep in mind , however , that within mean field theory these currents only occur in cases of time - reversal breaking mean fields as , for instance , in the case of the coriolis fields .",
    "the starting point of rmf theory is the well known local lagrangian density @xmath18 where the non - linear self - coupling of the @xmath1-field , which is important for an adequate description of nuclear surface properties and the deformations of finite nuclei , is taken into account according to ref .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ rmflagr ] ) contains as parameters the masses of the mesons @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the coupling constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the non - linear terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the field tensors for the vector mesons and the photon field are : @xmath27 in the present state of the art of the rmf theory , the meson and photon fields are treated as classical fields .",
    "two approximations , namely the _ mean - field approximation _ , in which the meson field operators are replaced by their expectation values @xmath28 which is justified by the fact that the source terms are large @xcite , and the _ no - sea approximation _ , in which only positive - energy states are taken into account @xcite , are employed in order to solve the lagrangian ( [ rmflagr ] ) .    for classical fields we can restrict ourselves to the intrinsic symmetry violating product wave function @xmath29 which can be represented as a generalized slater determinant .",
    "as long as we consider time - independent static or quasistatic fields , this limits the applicability of crhb theory to the yrast bands and to the excited bands of dominantly quasiparticle nature . in particular",
    ", the bands based on low - lying collective vibrations , such as for example @xmath30- , @xmath31-vibrational bands , can not be described in the present formalism since they have ( for example , in even - even nuclei ) an intrinsic wave function which is a linear superposition of many two - quasiparticle states . in order to study such bands",
    "one should employ time - dependent fields in the random phase approximation in the rotating frame : the task which has so far been resolved only in simple non - relativistic models with separable forces @xcite .    as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite in the unpaired formalism , the transformation to the rotating frame within the framework of the cranking model leads to the cranked relativistic mean field equations .",
    "note that in the present investigation we restrict ourselves to one - dimensional rotation with rotational frequency @xmath32 around the @xmath33-axis .",

    "in addition , standard rmf parameters do not reproduce scattering data in the @xmath84-channel , which is necessary for a reasonable description of pairing correlations . on the other hand , since we are using effective forces , there is no fundamental reason to have the same interaction both in the particle - hole and particle - particle channel @xcite . in a first - order approximation ,",

    "although this procedure formally breaks the lorentz structure of the rmf equations , one has to keep in mind that pairing itself is a completely non - relativistic phenomenon .",
    "relativistic effects such as the nuclear saturation mechanism due to the cancellation between attractive scalar and repulsive vector potentials , spin - orbit splitting and the admixture of small components through the kinetic term @xmath88 of the dirac equation @xcite are only important for the mean field part of hartree - bogoliubov theory and have only a negligible counterpart in the pairing field . the pairing density @xmath80 and the corresponding pairing field result from the scattering of pairs in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "the pairing density is concentrated in an energy window of a few mev around the fermi level , i.e. the contributions from the small components of the wave functions to the pairing tensor @xmath80 are very small .",
    "thus in the present version of the crhb theory , pairing correlations are only considered between the positive energy states .",
    "consequently , it is justified to approximate the pairing force by the best currently available non - relativistic interaction : the pairing part of the gogny force . at present , this is certainly more realistic than the use of a one - meson exchange force in the pairing channel , since this type of interactions has never been optimized for the description of pairing properties in finite nuclei .",

    "thus some spin values consistent with the signature of the calculated lowest sd configuration should be assumed for the experimental bands when a comparison is made with respect of the kinematic moment of inertia @xmath9 .",
    "taking into account that kinematic moments of inertia of linked sd bands in @xmath12pb and @xmath12hg and tentatively linked sd band in @xmath11pb are well described in the calculations , the spin values of unlinked bands can be obtained by comparing the calculated values of @xmath9 with experimental ones under different spin assignments . such a comparison ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed figures ) leads to the spin values @xmath263 for the lowest states in sd bands listed in table [ table - i0 ] . under these spin assignments , the crhb+ln calculations rather well describe experimental kinematic moments of inertia of sd bands in @xmath264pb and @xmath12hg ( fig .",

    "@xcite ) , indicates that the alignment process is very complicated and depends not only on the equilibrium deformation but also on the position of the fermi level .",
    "the decrease of neutron @xmath8 at frequencies higher than @xmath267 mev is in part compensated by the increase of proton @xmath8 due to the alignment of the @xmath238 proton pair .",

    "they decrease with increasing @xmath32 . in @xmath258po ,",
    "the @xmath190 values increase with increasing @xmath32 in the whole calculated frequency range ( fig .",

    "the increase of neutron number @xmath122 leads to the decrease of @xmath190 .",
    "the @xmath190 values increase within isotonic chain with increasing proton number @xmath304 .",

    "the features discussed above are very similar to the ones obtained for the transition quadrupole moment @xmath193 , see the discussion in previous sections .",
    "the basis assumption behind the kamlah expansion to second order @xcite used in the derivation of the lipkin - nogami method is that the system is well pair - correlated which means that the particle number fluctuation in the unprojected wave function @xmath306 is large .",
    "these quantities obtained in the crhb+ln calculations with the nl1 and nl3 forces for the rmf lagrangian and the d1s set for the gogny force are shown in fig .",

    "the particle number fluctuations decrease more or less smoothly with increasing rotational frequency indicating the quenching of pairing correlations due to the coriolis antipairing effect .",
    "one should note that even at the highest rotational frequencies these fluctuations remain reasonably large thus indicating that the approximate particle number projection by means of the lipkin - nogami method still remains within the applicability range of the kamlah expansion .",
    "the values of @xmath307 in neutron and proton subsystems correlate with the pairing energies @xmath106 calculated in these subsystems .",
    "for example , in the calculations with the nl1 force the particle number fluctuations are larger for neutrons than for protons ( see fig .  [ fig - dn2 ] ) which correlates with the fact that the absolute values of pairing energies are larger for neutrons ( see figs .",
    "[ sys - pair ] , [ pb98-qt - epair]b and [ fig - po98]b ) .",
    "the situation is somewhat different in the calculations with the nl3 force , where at medium and high rotational frequencies the proton subsystem is more pair - correlated than the neutron one as reflected in the particle number fluctuations ( fig .",

    "the formalism of the cranked relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory with and without approximate particle number projection before variation by means of the lipkin - nogami method is presented in detail .",
    "the relativistic mean field theory is used in the particle - hole channel of this theory , while a non - relativistic finite range two - body force of gogny type is employed in the particle - particle ( pairing ) channel . considering that the pairing is a genuine non - relativistic effect which plays a role only in the vicinity of the fermi surface ,",
    "the use of the best non - relativistic force in the pairing channel seems well justified .",
    "its applicability to the description of rotating nuclei and the main features of this theory have been studied on the example of the yrast superdeformed bands observed in even - even nuclei of the @xmath0 mass region .",
    "the main conclusions emerging from this study are the following :    * ( i ) * the calculations without particle number projection do provide only a poor description of experimental rotational features such as the kinematic @xmath9 and the dynamic @xmath8 moments of inertia .",
    "the calculated kinematic moments of inertia are larger than the experimental values .",
    "the same is also true for the dynamic moments of inertia at low and medium rotational frequencies .",
    "the calculations without particle number projection lead to a unphysical collapse of pairing correlations as has been seen in the proton subsystem of @xmath11hg and @xmath12pb .",
    "as was shown by subsequent calculations with particle number projection these problems are related to the poor treatment of pairing correlations .    *",
    "( ii ) * approximate particle number projection by means of the lipkin - nogami method considerably improves an agreement with experiment .",
    "the correlations induced by the lipkin - nogami method produce the desired effects , namely , * ( a ) * to increase the strength of the pairing correlations , * ( b ) * to diminish the kinematic moments of inertia at all frequencies , * ( c ) * to diminish the dynamic moments of inertia at low and medium rotational frequencies and * ( d ) * to delay proton and neutron alignments to higher frequencies .",
    "in addition , there is no collapse of pairing correlations in the whole rotational frequency range under investigation .",
    "systematic calculations with the nl1 force for the rmf lagrangian and the d1s set for the gogny force have been performed for all even - even nuclei in which sd bands have been observed so far . with an exception of @xmath258pb",
    ", an excellent description of the rotational properties of yrast sd bands such as the dynamic and kinematic moments of inertia is obtained in a way free from adjustable parameters .",
    "it was concluded that the investigation of the structure of sd bands in neighboring odd nuclei is needed in order to better understand the problems seen in this nucleus .    *",
    "( iii ) * it has been investigated how much the results of calculations with approximate particle number projection by means of the lipkin - nogami method depend on the parametrization of the rmf lagrangian and the gogny force .",
    "it was found that the combination of the nl1 set for the rmf lagrangian and the d1s set for the gogny force produce very good agreement with experimental rotational properties .",
    "the d1 and d1p sets of the parameters for the gogny force produce too strong pairing correlations and thus fail to describe properly the rotational properties of sd bands .",
    "an unexpected result of the present investigation is the fact that the nl3 force , which is believed to be the best rmf force for the description of nuclear properties far from beta - stability region , provides a less accurate description of the rotational properties of sd bands in the @xmath0 mass region compared with the force nl1 .",
    "this is most likely related to the single - particle spectra produced by this force in the sd minimum .",
    "it is possible that the improvement of the description of the isospin properties far from beta - stability region obtained in the nl3 force as compared with the nl1 force is reached at the cost of some worsening of the description of the single - particle spectra close to beta - stability region .    *",
    "( iv ) * the dependence of the results on the strength of the gogny force in the pairing channel has been studied in the calculations with approximate particle number projection by means of the lipkin - nogami method .",
    "it was found that a change of the strength by @xmath308% has significant impact on the rotational properties of sd bands such as the kinematic and dynamic moment of inertia .",
    "contrary to previous investigations within the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov theory at no rotation and with no particle number projection , where the strength of the gogny force has been increased by factor 1.15 , here a very good description of rotational properties has been obtained with no modification of the strength of the gogny force .    * ( v ) * the results of the calculations with particle number projection indicate the general trend of a decrease of the average transition quadrupole ( @xmath193 ) and mass hexadecupole @xmath309 ) moments in the isotopic chain with increasing neutron number @xmath122 and an increase of these quantities within the isotonic chain with increasing proton number @xmath304 .    * ( vi ) * neutron and proton pairing energies in all the calculated nuclei decrease with increasing rotational frequency reflecting the quenching of pairing correlations due to the coriolis anti - pairing effect .",
    "the pairing energies @xmath106 calculated in the nl1+d1s+ln scheme do not show considerable variations as a function of @xmath304 and @xmath122 : the maximum difference between pairing energies calculated in two different nuclei is around 16% .",
    "a smooth increase of absolute values of pairing energies with increasing @xmath122 is observed in the isotopic pb and hg chains which correlates with the decrease of the transition quadrupole moments @xmath193 .",
    "the size of the pairing energies strongly depends on the parametrization of the gogny force and the rmf lagrangian , as well as on the strength of the gogny force .    *",
    "( vii ) * the difference between the experimental dynamic moments of inertia of two bands and the effective alignment @xmath10 between these bands is reasonably well reproduced in most of the cases .",
    "further investigation of neighboring odd nuclei is needed in order to find the origin of the remaining discrepancies .",
    "finally , the present work should be considered as one of the first steps in the investigation of rotating nuclei in the pairing regime within the framework of the rmf theory .",
    "different tasks definitely lie ahead .",
    "for example , an investigation of the rotational bands based on one- and multi - quasiparticle configurations in the @xmath0 mass region is mandatory in order to see how the present theory can reproduce the effects connected with the blocking of one or several quasiparticle orbitals .",
    "one can expect that the lipkin - nogami method is a reasonably good approximation to the exact particle number projection in the regimes of strong pairing correlations as it holds in the case of the @xmath0 mass region .",
    "it remains to investigate if this method is also a good approximation in the regimes of weak pairing correlations typical at high rotational frequencies in sd bands of other regions of the periodic table , such as the @xmath5 , @xmath310 and @xmath230 mass regions .",
