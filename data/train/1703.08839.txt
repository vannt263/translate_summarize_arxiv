    "the zero range process ( zrp ) is the system of identical particles on a countable set @xmath2 whose dynamics is described by the following rules ( if the sites are homogeneous ) : if a site @xmath3 is occupied by @xmath1 particles , then one of @xmath1 particles leaves @xmath4 after an exponential waiting time with rate @xmath5 .",
    "the particle leaving @xmath4 chooses a target site @xmath6 with probability @xmath7 and then it immediately moves to @xmath6 . as a special case of the zrp , the system of @xmath8 particles on @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 with @xmath12 , is an _ integrable _ model originated from the @xmath0-boson model introduced by sasamoto and wadati @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will call this special case of the zrp the ( spatial - homogeneous ) @xmath0-deformed totally asymmetric zero range process ( @xmath0-tazrp ) .",
    "the integrability of the @xmath0-tazrp was studied by povolotsky @xcite and its transition probability was obtained by korhonen and lee @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-tazrp is also a special case of the zero - range chipping model introduced by povolotsky @xcite in which multiple particles are allowed to jump at the same time and a jumping rate depends on the number of particles jumping as well as the number of particles at the departing site .",
    "the @xmath0-tazrp can be generalized to let the jumping rates depend on not only the number of particles at the departure site , but also the site @xmath4 itself , so that the jumping rate at @xmath4 occupied by @xmath1 particles is given by @xmath13 the finite system with the rate function is well defined if @xmath14 , and we assume that all @xmath15 are in a compact subset of @xmath16 .",
    "the transition probability of this model with finitely many particles was obtained by wang and waugh @xcite as an extension of korhonen and lee s work @xcite .",
    "we note that the transition probability can also be derived as a degeneration of the higher spin stochastic six vertex model studied by borodin and petrov @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath0-tazrp with spatial - inhomogeneous jumping rate ( that we refer to simply as @xmath0-tazrp throughout the paper ) is not much studied in literature , its dual model , the @xmath0-deformed totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( @xmath0-tasep ) with particle - dependent jumping rate , has been extensively studied in @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold : first for an arbitrary initial condition in the @xmath8-particle @xmath0-tazrp , we find the explicit distribution function for the position of a tagged particle ( as the @xmath17-th rightmost or leftmost particle ) at time @xmath18 if the jumping rates are given by . in @xcite",
    "the transition probability for an @xmath8-particle system was obtained from which we derive the distribution of a tagged particle s position as a marginal probability .",
    "the result is given in theorem [ main - theorem-1 ] .",
    "we also find the distribution function for a tagged particle s position under the so - called step initial condition which is such that initially infinitely many particles occupy a single site and all other sites are empty , as shown in theorem [ theorem - step ] . under the step initial condition ,",
    "the distribution of a tagged particle s position is represented by a contour integral of the fredholm determinant of a certain trace class operator .",
    "we also study the asymptotic behaviour of this fredholm determinant representation when @xmath19 goes to infinity .",
    "this result is given in theorem [ thm : asymp ] .",
    "we note that although the distribution of the @xmath20-th rightmost particle at time @xmath19 in the limit that both @xmath20 and @xmath19 go to infinity can be obtained by the known results for the @xmath0-tasep , as discussed in appendix [ sec : tw_limit ] , the limiting distribution when @xmath20 is fixed is new .",
    "since our limiting distribution agrees with that for the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ) , these results may describe a new universal behaviour of interacting particle systems .",
    "first , we consider a system that consists of @xmath8 identical particles on @xmath21 .",
    "we label particles @xmath22 from the rightmost particle .",
    "we assume that if more than one particle occupy the same position , they are ordered vertically such that the label of a particle at a higher position is smaller than the label of a particle at a lower position .",
    "we interpret the particle labelled @xmath20 as the @xmath20-th rightmost particle .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the position of the @xmath20-th rightmost particle at time @xmath19 , and @xmath19 may be omitted if it is not necessary to specify the time . by abuse of notation , we also use @xmath24 to denote the @xmath20-th particle itself .",
    "the state of an @xmath8-particle system is represented by @xmath25 and a state at time @xmath19 is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "alternatively , a state can be specified by the number of particles at each site .",
    "we denote the number of particles at site @xmath1 ( at time @xmath19 ) by @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) .",
    "hence , a state @xmath29 is equivalently expressed as @xmath30 , which satisfies @xmath31 .",
    "the rules of the model are a specialization of the rules for the general zrp explained in the beginning of this paper .",
    "but since we label the otherwise identical particles , the rules can be described more concretely .",
    "we fix @xmath32 .",
    "if a site @xmath4 is occupied by @xmath1 particles , then the particle at the top of the particles ( the particle itself if a site is occupied by only one particle ) jumps to the bottom of the particles at @xmath33 ( if there are other particles at @xmath34 ) after an exponential time with rate @xmath35 where @xmath36 for all @xmath37 . in this procedure",
    "only the particle at the top may jump after an exponential time and other particles do not respond to the exponential clock .",
    "if the local state at @xmath4 is changed , that is , if the number of particles at @xmath4 is changed from @xmath1 to @xmath38 , then the exponential clock is reset to have the new rate @xmath39 and the particle at the top jumps after a new exponential time .",
    "also , we assume that all waiting times are independent .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the probability measure with an initial state @xmath41 of the process .",
    "we also consider an infinite system as a limiting case of @xmath8-particle system .",

    ", the infinite particles are labelled by consecutive integers .",
    "we assume that at any time @xmath51 , among all particles at site @xmath4 , particles are stacked vertically with @xmath24 above @xmath52 if @xmath53 , and further assume that the particle on the top ( that with the smallest label ) exists .",
    "furthermore , we assume that this top particle jumps out of @xmath4 to @xmath34 , and stays below all existing particles there .",
    "hence at all time @xmath51 , @xmath54 if @xmath53 . the @xmath0-tazrp with step initial condition , which is the infinite particle model analyzed in this paper , is defined in the following subsection .      in general , a zrp on @xmath55 has a particle - spacing duality with a simple exclusion process on @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-tazrp considered in our paper is dual to the @xmath0-tasep introduced by borodin and corwin @xcite .",
    "the intuitive meaning of this duality is simple : we interpret the number of particles at site @xmath1 in the @xmath0-tazrp as the spacing between the @xmath1-th and @xmath56-th particles in the @xmath0-tasep .",
    "below we describe the duality in precise terms and focus on the construction of the @xmath0-tasep from the @xmath0-tazrp .",
    "the inverse construction can be done in the same way , and we omit it since it is not relevant in our paper .",
    "it is better to consider the duality between @xmath0-tazrp and @xmath0-tasep with infinitely many particles , rather than the finite - particle system defined above in our paper .",
    "suppose that initially no site is occupied by infinitely many particles and there are infinitely many particles to the left and to the right of @xmath4 , respectively , for each @xmath37 . in this case",
    "it is impossible to say the `` rightmost '' particle and the `` leftmost '' particle , and in probability @xmath57 no site is occupied by infinitely many particles at any finite time @xmath51 .",
    "let us label the particles at the initial time @xmath58 as follows .",
    "we find the closest occupied site on @xmath59 $ ] to the origin , and call a particle at this site @xmath60 . if there are more than one particle at this site , since we assume that they are vertically stacked and the top particle exists , we call the particle at the top @xmath60 . by the ordering method introduced in section [ subsec : defn_of_model ] we label the other particles at the same position as that of @xmath60 and the particles to the left of @xmath60 as @xmath61 consecutively , and label the particles to the right of @xmath60 as @xmath62 consecutively .",
    "hence , at any time @xmath51 , we express a state @xmath63 as a bi - infinite sequence whose terms are in weakly decreasing order , and @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "there is an alternative unique parametrization @xmath30 with @xmath66 at site @xmath1 at @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the state of the particles in the @xmath0-tazrp described above .",
    "then we define a bi - infinite strictly decreasing sequence @xmath69 recursively by @xmath70 and for @xmath18 @xmath71 if we interpret @xmath72 as the position of the particle labelled @xmath1 in an infinite particle system on @xmath55 at time @xmath19 , the dynamics of this particle system can be described as follows : each particle has an exponential clock that rings independently such that the clock for the particle labelled @xmath1 has rate @xmath73 when the clock rings , the particle moves one step to the right , see figure [ fig : zrp_sep_infinite ] .",
    "( if the right neighbour site is blocked by another particle , we have that the exponential clock rings at rate @xmath74 , and the particle does not move . )",

    "the jump of @xmath75 changes the height function by flipping the lower @xmath76 corner to the dashed @xmath77 wedge .",
    "hence if we imagine the height function is for a surface , it grows upward when the @xmath0-tasep evolves . ]",
    "if the @xmath0-tazrp model has infinitely many particles and the rightmost particle , which is denoted by @xmath78 , exists , then @xmath79 is uniquely described by @xmath30 .",

    "the corresponding @xmath0-tasep has infinitely many particles , and sites of @xmath21 far to either side are densely packed with particles at any given time @xmath19 .",
    "we note that in all the forms of the correspondence between @xmath0-tazrp and @xmath0-tasep described in the above , the number of particles in the @xmath0-tasep is infinite , and we can not specify the rightmost particle and the leftmost particle .",
    "but , if in the @xmath0-tazrp a unique site , say site @xmath74 , is occupied by infinitely many particles and all sites to its left are empty , then the corresponding @xmath0-tasep has the rightmost particle .",

    "it is clear that the dyck path has a 1 - 1 correspondence with the @xmath0-tasep model , and as time @xmath19 increases , the dyck path monotonically moves upward .",
