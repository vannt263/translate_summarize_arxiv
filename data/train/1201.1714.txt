    "complex ( dusty ) plasmas have been proven to be an instructive reference system for strong coupling and correlation effects @xcite .",
    "thereby , complex plasma research inherently connects key issues from several fields including low temperature physics , warm dense matter physics , surface and solid - state physics , as well as material science @xcite .",
    "the first principle description of complex plasmas is a theoretically challenging problem .",
    "a dusty plasma consists of electrons , positive ions , neutral atoms , and micrometer - sized dust grains , i.e. , components with distinct mass asymmetry giving rise to dynamics on very different spatial and temporal scales .",
    "this multi - scale behavior , combined with the _ non - ideal character _ of a complex plasma , makes a full temporal resolution on all scales a numerically unfeasible task with current computer technology . however , there are two numerical approaches that can address the challenges associated with the complex plasma system : the one - component plasma ( ocp ) model and the particle - in - cell ( pic ) method .",
    "the ocp approach relies on the idea to reduce the quasi - neutral , multi - component complex plasma to the subsystem of dust grains which interact via a screened coulomb potential .",
    "in particular , the statically screened ( yukawa - type ) potential yields good agreement with the experiments for various specific setups , see for example refs . @xcite . also , this isotropic potential is well suited for fundamental analytical and numerical investigations on cooperative effects such as self - organized structure formation @xcite , collective dynamical processes @xcite , spectral properties @xcite , or the melting behavior  @xcite in strongly correlated ( screened ) coulomb systems .",
    "the multi - component and non - equilibrium nature of a complex plasma requires , however , a careful analysis of plasma streaming and dynamical grain charging effects , which were experimentally shown to become of utmost importance at least near the plasma sheath , see e.g.  @xcite . in a plasma with ions streaming at a uniform velocity ,",
    "the dust potential becomes ( strongly ) anisotropic and takes the form of an oscillatory wake structure in the downstream direction , which was subject to various analytical and numerical studies e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this wake can result in attractive , non - reciprocal forces between the equally charged dust grains and lead to remarkable structural and dynamical consequences  @xcite .",
    "streaming effects can be incorporated in the ocp dynamical screening model by means of linear response ( lr ) theory , as presented in section  [ dsm ] .",
    "the second powerful numerical ansatz to tackle the multi - scale problem of the different plasma components is the pic approach , in which the trajectories of plasma particles are followed in electric fields self - consistently @xcite . to obtain a self - consistent charge on the grains ,",
    "the plasma dynamics need to be resolved in the vicinity of the grain on spatial and temporal scales which are smaller than the debye length and electron plasma period , respectively .",
    "however , due to the large mass of grains ( as compared to electrons and ions ) as well as the large distances between the grains , the study of the dynamics of several dust grains requires simulation times that are much longer than the dust charging ( which is on the ion plasma period time scale ) .",
    "thus , a self - consistent 3d pic calculation , i.e. , a dynamic evolution of the 3d system with more than one dust grain with a temporal resolution on the electron or ion plasma period time scale , required to ensure self - consistency , easily exceeds the capabilities of present high - performance computing systems  @xcite .    consequently , short - time , small - scale pic simulations of dust charging or , alternatively , less demanding lr calculations of the dynamical plasma shielding have to be coupled with large - scale ocp simulations which incorporate the interaction between the grains on a more abstract level @xcite .",
    "such a coupled multi - scale numerical approach may ensure the description of the correlated system dynamics with proper charges on the grains as well as an accurate potential distribution in the vicinity of grains . with the goal to form a method - spanning picture , the present publication comprises a systematic analysis of the electrostatic potential distribution around a dust grain in the presence of a streaming plasma environment by    1 .   a high precision computation of the dynamically screened coulomb potential from the dynamic dielectric function , and 2 .   a critical assessment of these lr results , in particular in the view of non - linear effects and dynamical grain charging processes by means of self - consistent 3d pic simulations",
    "the discussion of the lr results , section [ dsm ] , extends over a broad range of plasma streaming velocities , different electron - to - ion temperature ratios and includes an evaluation of the influence of collisional damping .",
    "the corresponding 3d pic simulations , section [ sec : pic ] , are performed for the collisionless limit and apply , therefore , to the low pressure limit . finally , it is vital to verify whether and to what degree the results obtained by a linear superposition of single grain potentials do coincide with the corresponding full 3d pic simulations .",
    "such a direct comparison is performed for the case of two grains in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the plasma parameters are scaled to relevant base units , which are , in our case , the debye length @xmath0 and the plasma period @xmath1 , with the corresponding plasma frequency @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes electrons ( e ) or ions ( i ) .",
    "@xmath4 is the corresponding temperature , @xmath5 density , @xmath6 mass , @xmath7 charge , @xmath8 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath9 is the permittivity of vacuum .",
    "the relative streaming velocity @xmath10 of the ions with respect to the dust is characterized by the mach number @xmath11 , where the ion sound ( bohm ) speed is given by @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , the thermal velocity is @xmath13 .    the dynamically screened dust potential and in particular the characteristics of the wake ,",
    "are studied with respect to three dimensionless plasma parameters :    * the ion drift velocity , expressed in terms of the mach number @xmath14 , * the ratio of electron - to - ion temperature @xmath15 , * the ion - neutral scattering frequency ( normalized to the ion plasma frequency ) @xmath16 .",
    "while the temperature ratio @xmath17 controls the effect of landau damping , the frequency ratio @xmath16 determines the effect of collisional damping and can be effectively controlled in experiments by changing the neutral gas pressure . a simple approximation for the pressure as function of the ion - neutral collision frequency and ion temperature is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the elementary charge , and",

    "the ions are considered to be singly charged ( @xmath22 ) .",

    "the corresponding electron debye length is @xmath26 .",
    "an atomic mass of argon @xmath27 leads to the bohm speed of @xmath28 . for the considered set of parameters , the ion plasma frequency takes the value of @xmath29 . for the pic simulations , we simulate ions with a reduced mass @xmath30 , and thus @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "are increased accordingly ( see section [ pictheory ] for details ) .",
    "the lr and pic results presented in this paper do not involve any kind of free fit parameters .",
    "the dust grains are charged by plasma currents and other currents , such as induced by the photoelectric effect or secondary electron emission . for the charge equilibrium ,",
    "the net current to the grain is zero , and such a grain is at _ floating _ potential @xmath33 with respect to the surrounding plasma . if charging is only due to plasma currents ( i.e. , electron and ion fluxes to the surface ) , then in electropositive plasmas , the charge @xmath34 on the grain and the floating potential will be negative , due to the high mobility of electrons . the floating potential on a spherical , finite - sized grain can be approximated with the orbit - motion - limited ( oml ) approach for both stationary and flowing collisionless plasmas @xcite .",
    "we note that in the presence of collisions , the oml theory can give incorrect results , as it has been noted by several authors @xcite .",
    "the presence of trapped ions created by ion - neutral collisions can increase the ion current to the grain , and thus reduce the charge on the grain @xcite .",
    "typical charging characteristics for a spherical conducting grain in stationary plasma .",
    "data is from 3d pic simulations of a stationary plasma with @xmath35 , time @xmath36 is normalized with the ion plasma period @xmath37.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in a stationary plasma , the charging of a grain takes approximately one ion plasma period , @xmath37 , a time in which the ions can collectively respond to the perturbations in the electric field . a typical charging characteristic for a single , spherical conducting grain is shown in fig .  [ fig : chargingpic ] , where the data is taken from 3d pic simulations for the stationary plasma with @xmath35 . in the static case ,",
    "the charge on a small grain can be calculated with the capacitance model for a given floating potential  @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the grain radius and @xmath40 the total debye length defined in terms of electron and ion debye lengths @xmath41 for a static case , i.e. , @xmath42 . when charging is only due to plasma currents , the floating potential in a collisionless plasma is typically on the order of @xmath43 .",
    "thus , from the capacitance model one can derive a formula for an approximate charge on a negligible small grain with @xmath44 : @xmath45 } t_{e , [ ev ] } \\quad,\\ ] ] where the grain radius @xmath39 is given in micrometers , and temperature in ev . in the case of no plasma flow relative to the dust grain , the negatively charged grain",
    "is shielded by a stationary , positively charged ion cloud .",
    "the electric potential around a small ( non - absorbing ) charged grain takes the form of a statically screened coulomb potential which is typically referred to as debye - hckel or yukawa potential @xmath46 plasma absorption , ion - neutral collisions , and plasma flow can modify the potential distribution . in particular , the long - range asymptote of the plasma - mediated potential is often not screened exponentially , but has a power - law decay instead , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the plasma flow breaks the symmetry in the grain charging . in the mezothermal velocity regime ,",
    "when the flow velocity @xmath47 is larger than the ion thermal velocity @xmath48 and lower than the electron thermal velocity @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , the grain will receive a larger ion flux to the surface on the upstream than on the downstream side , while the electron flux will be similar to both sides .",
    "anisotropic charging can lead to an electric dipole on the grain @xcite .",
    "the electric dipole moment depends on the material of the grain and is more pronounced for supersonic flows @xcite . for small conducting grains the electric dipole can often be neglected , as the charge is redistributed on the surface , but for larger conducting grains , potential distribution in the vicinity of a grain can modify the charge distribution on the grain surface .",
    "a streaming plasma leads to a wake in the density and potential distributions around the grain .",
    "the main mechanisms for the wake formation are plasma absorption on the grain surface and the influence of the electric field on plasma particle trajectories in the vicinity of the grain @xcite .",
    "plasma absorption leads to density depletion on the downstream side , while electric fields can scatter ions into the wake region forming the ion focus region .",
    "both effects are more pronounced for cold ions , as well as for supersonic flows , when also a mach cone forms .",
    "the charging time in a streaming plasma is longer than in a stationary plasma and depends on the material of a dust grain , being longer for insulating grains , for which it can take several ion plasma periods to reach stationary conditions .",
    "[ dsm ] according to the ocp concept , the multi - component dusty plasma can be reduced to the subsystem of dust grains which interact via a dynamically screened coulomb potential .",

    "( [ potential ] ) is to make use of the axial symmetry in streaming direction by introducing cylindrical coordinates .",
    "however , the numerical evaluation of the resulting radial hankel transform is very time - consuming and converges poorly due to an oscillating bessel function in the integrand . instead , an alternative approach was used here to improve the memory and time efficiency by exploiting the radial symmetry .",

    "the main issue of the lr approach is the correct estimate of the grain charge as a function of @xmath14 , and also for a grain that is shadowed by another grain located upstream .",

    "upstream and to the side from the grain , the potential decay can be approximated by a yukawa potential .",
    "the effective screening length increases in both directions with the flow , but in contrast to earlier lr results  @xcite , it is found to be larger in the upstream direction than laterally from the grain .    in a system of several grains in a plasma flow , the charge and potential on the downstream grains can be significantly modified by wake effects .",
    "the results from pic simulations show that the wake behind the two grains can include non - linear effects , and that the charge on the downstream grains can be significantly reduced . while the general wake pattern can be represented by a linear combination of wakes behind a single grain to a rather good accuracy ,",
    "local deviations up to @xmath239 of the potential are observed for subsonic flows in the closest vicinity of the grains .",
    "thus , special care needs to be taken when applying lr results in ocp simulations , and at least the charge reduction on the downstream grains needs to be considered for the model to be credible .    the influence of wake effects on collective many - particle behaviour in 3d plasma crystals has become a very timely question and is currently under ongoing experimental and theoretical investigation  @xcite .",
    "the presented wake potentials are currently employed in dynamical dust simulations which accompany the experimental exploration of string formation and externally triggered phase transitions in 3d confined dusty plasma clouds  @xcite .",

    "in particular , the generalization of the dynamically screened dust approach will open the way to a description of non - equilibrium quantum systems , such as warm dense matter , on the microscopic level .",
    "there , the classical dielectric function must be replaced by the corresponding quantum ( mermin ) dielectric function  @xcite .",
