    "for the non - photometric data ( table  [ table : tb_obslog ] ) from the nights of 2004 june 21 and 22 , and 2006 march 05 , the comet fields were re - imaged under photometric conditions on 2005 may 18 and 2006 june 03 for `` boot - strap '' calibration .",
    "multiple ( @xmath32 ) field stars were measured on both the calibration images and the non - photometric images and differential photometry was used to compute the photometrically - calibrated brightness of the comet .",

    "absence of a detectable coma @xmath34  days before perihelion is consistent with 1991 apparition observations of @xcite who found no coma at @xmath36  days before perihelion , yet a clearly detectable coma at @xmath37 days .",

    "the reduced magnitude , @xmath38 , i.e. , the observed magnitude normalized to unit heliocentric distance , @xmath4 , and geocentric distance , @xmath39 , for zero phase angle , @xmath40 , was derived from the relationship for active comets    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the @xmath23-band photometric magnitude measured in a 3  circular aperture , @xmath43 the linear phase coefficient = 0.035  mag  deg@xmath10 , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are constants , taken to be unity and 2 respectively .",
    "nominally , values for these two latter constants ( @xmath44 being dependent on dust grain production , coma shape and size ) are derived from modeling a given comet at a variety of heliocentric distances if there are sufficient observational data .",
    "equation  [ eq : redmags ] also is appropriate for expressing the brightness of an active comet with a spherical coma around the nucleus ( measured in a circular aperture , as described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as opposed to the relation used by @xcite which is the proscription for the brightness of bare nuclei ( non - active stage ) .",
    "computation of the reduced magnitude is a standard method that enables of photometric data of an individual comet obtained at a variety of heliocentric distances ( different activity level ) to be intercompared . for 21p",
    ", we obtained observations of the comet when there was no visible coma , when the comet exhibited a small coma around the nucleus , and when the comet was highly active displaying a significant , spatially extended coma with an elongated tail .",
    "to properly intercompare variations in the integrated aperture surface brightness , the @xmath23-band photometric magnitudes were determined by measuring the comet s brightness in a small 3   circular aperture centered on the nucleus .",
    "use of this small nucleo - centric aperture minimized the coma contribution to the measured flux density , and allowed estimation of the nucleus brightness consistent with the uniform azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profile .",
    "our observations of 21p span a range of heliocentric distance , both pre- and post - perihelion ( table  [ table : tb_obslog ] ) , thus we can examine trends in @xmath38 with @xmath4 .",

    "evidently , cometary activity commenced near @xmath0  au this apparition of 21p , and the majority of our optical observations and all of our _ spitzer _",
    "images were obtained while the comet was in an active state .",
    "average coma color differences ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) are also listed in table  [ table : tb_mags ] for dates when multi - wavelength observations were conducted .",
    "the average colors of comet 21p , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are redder than the respective solar colors , 0.36 and 0.28 , in the krons - cousins system , transforming the johnson solar colors @xcite using the relation of @xcite .",
    "band emission from gaseous molecular species , such as c@xmath8 ( @xmath50 ) , nh@xmath8 ( @xmath51 ) , and cn ( @xmath52 ) , or atomic o  i ( @xmath53   @xmath54d ) potentially could contribute significantly to the flux density of comet comae observed within our @xmath55 broadband filters .",
    "however , optical spectra of @xcite indicates that band and line emission from these species is relatively weak in the coma of 21p .",
    "21p also lies along the @xmath56 versus @xmath57 color - color trend line of jupiter - family comet nuclei attributed by @xcite to albedo variation ( in   [ oir - albedo ] we derive an dust albedo estimate for 21p ) , although we can not quote a precise value for the nucleus color of 21p due to coma contamination .",
    "broad - band colors of cometary nuclei are related to surface properties of the nucleus @xcite and provide a metric to compare cometary nuclei to other small solar system bodies and to assess which parent body populations give rise to jupiter - family comets .",
    "the bluer color of 21p and other jupiter - family comets , as compared to the mean color of kuiper - belt object / trans - neptunian object populations , @xmath58 @xcite , suggests that cometary activity and surface processing in the inner solar system have altered the primitive surfaces of these nuclei agglomerated from materials in the kuiper belt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
