    "diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) @xcite has been the subject of extensive study since it was first introduced .",
    "this model exhibits a growth process that produces highly ramified self similar patterns , which are believed to be fractals @xcite .",
    "it seems that dla captures the essential mechanism in many natural growth processes , such as viscous fingering @xcite , dielectric breakdown @xcite , etc . in spite of the apparent simplicity of the model ,",
    "an analytic solution is still unavailable .",
    "particularly , the exact value of the fractal dimension is not known .",
    "some of the analytic approaches employed so far include the fixed scale transformation ( fst ) @xcite , real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) @xcite and conformal mapping @xcite .    in dla",
    "there is a seed cluster of particles fixed somewhere .",
    "a particle is released at a distance from the cluster , and performs a random walk until it attempts to penetrate the fixed cluster , in which case it sticks .",
    "then the next particle is released and so on .",
    "there are two common types of sticking conditions .",
    "the sticking condition described above is called `` bond - dla '' , because it occurs when the random walker attempts to cross a perimeter bond between an unoccupied site and the aggregate . in an earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we solved the bond - dla problem using a markovian process . here",
    "we apply similar methods to the `` site - dla '' case , where sticking occurs as soon as the random walker arrives at a site that is a nearest neighbor to the aggregate . since it is believed that the large scale structure of dla is not sensitive to the type of sticking conditions used @xcite , one expects both problems to yield the same asymptotic fractal structures .",
    "dla can be grown in various geometries . in this paper",
    "we deal with the cylindrical geometry in two dimensions ( 2d ) , where the particles are emitted from a distant horizontal line at the top , while the seed cluster is a parallel line at the bottom , with periodic boundary conditions on the sides .",
    "we only consider relatively narrow cylinders , with widths ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "even though the analysis in this paper is solely 2d , the same techniques can be applied in higher dimensions .",
    "an exact solution of bond - dla with @xmath2 was published in 1998 @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the same approach was used in order to solve slightly wider cases with @xmath0 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the solution presented in the latter case is not exact , but still , it presents a well controlled series of approximations in the sense that any desired numerical accuracy could be obtained , provided that a sufficiently high - order of approximation is used .",
    "the difficulty with performing a high - order calculation is that its complexity grows exponentially .",
    "the main idea in these references and in this paper is to follow the dynamics of the growing front .",
    "the shape of the interface determines the unique solution to the laplace equation that determines the growth probabilities .",
    "the structure of the aggregate behind the interface is irrelevant and so is the history that led to the current interface .",
    "each growth process changes the interface .",
    "we can therefore describe dla as a markovian flow in the space of interface configurations .",
    "the markov states are the possible shapes of the interface , which are indexed by an integer , usually denoted by @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 , the probability that the interface is in state @xmath6 at time @xmath9 , depends only on the state of the interface at time @xmath10 .",
    "the conditional transition probabilities from state @xmath7 to state @xmath6 make up the evolution matrix @xmath11 , which is time independent .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the markov chain is described by the master equations , @xmath12 each matrix element @xmath11 corresponds to a particular growth process , and the sum of @xmath7 runs over all the interface configurations ( whose number may be infinite ) . in order to fully describe the dynamics",
    ", it is necessary to calculate the probabilities of all the possible growth processes , for each of the possible initial configurations of the interface .",
    "we calculate the growth probabilities by solving the discrete laplace equation on a lattice for a function @xmath13 , which corresponds to the average density of random walkers , @xmath14 in the dielectric breakdown model ( dbm ) @xcite @xmath13 has an electrostatic meaning , so it is also commonly referred to as the `` potential '' .",
    "usually , the equation set ( [ markov dynamics ] ) is infinite because the number of possible shapes the interface may assume is unlimited .",
    "this may pose a problem for two reasons .",
    "for one , it is difficult to include all of the possibilities systematically .",
    "the case of bond - dla with @xmath2 is a counter - example , where the complete set of possible configurations can be easily characterized using a single parameter .",
    "this is because the interface has the shape of a step whose height @xmath7 can be any nonnegative integer @xcite . for @xmath15 , however , it is very difficult to parametrise the shape of the interface , even with the use of more than one parameter , because complex overhangs may occur @xcite .",
    "the second problem is that even if it was possible to account for a complete infinite set of configurations , it would still be awkward to analyze the markov process , e.g. , finding its fixed point . instead of accounting for all the configurations",
    ", we make an approximation by employing some consistent truncation scheme on the list of configurations . in the @xmath16th - order approximation",
    "we include only the top @xmath16 rows of a configuration and truncate the rest ; the list of configurations is sorted according to the maximal height difference , @xmath17 , between the lowest and highest particles on the interface @xcite . in the @xmath16th - order approximation ,",
    "only a finite set of configurations with @xmath18 are taken into account .",
    "the configurations with @xmath19 are truncated so that only their top @xmath16 rows are taken into account ( below the @xmath16th row all the sites are considered to be occupied ) .",
    "this truncation does not have a noticeable effect on the upward growth probability ( the growth probability at the tip ) , because of the exponential decay of the potential inside deep fjords .",
    "because of this exponential decay , the approximation converges very fast as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , the number of configurations diverges exponentially with @xmath16 , so that the calculation can be carried out only for relatively low - order ( depending on the width @xmath0 and on the strength of the computer ) .    in the case of site - dla ,",
    "the situation is a bit simpler than in bond - dla , because it is generally harder for the random walker to penetrate deep into a fjord .",
    "a particle will only be able to enter fjords that are three sites wide or more , unlike the case of bond - dla , where a particle can go into a single column fjord .",
    "this makes the solution of site - dla with @xmath2 and @xmath20 much simpler , because they both have only a finite number of interface configurations . the narrowest cylinder that can have an arbitrarily deep fjord ( a configuration with an arbitrarily large @xmath17 ) arises for @xmath21 , and thus there is an infinite number of configurations",
    "however , there can be no fluctuations in the width of the fjord , so in this sense this case resembles the @xmath2 case in bond - dla . for @xmath22",
    "the approximation method must be used , but generally , for the same @xmath0 and @xmath16 the number of configurations in site - dla is much smaller than in bond - dla , so it is possible to perform higher - order calculations for wider cylinders .",
    "once an order of approximation @xmath16 is chosen , there is only a finite number of configurations , @xmath23 , which depends both on @xmath0 and on @xmath16 . the markov process is then closed and irreducible .",
    "closed means that @xmath24 for @xmath25 , and irreducible means that there is a finite probability to go from any initial state @xmath7 to any final state @xmath6 during a finite number of time steps .",
    "a basic theorem in markov theory states that a closed and irreducible process necessarily has a single fixed point @xcite .",
    "this fixed point represents the steady - state probabilities for the various interface configurations in the asymptotic time limit .",
    "the theorem is also true for an infinite number of states , so one can conclude that the unapproximated process also converges to a steady state .",
    "as mentioned , this steady state is characterized for example by a time independent average density @xmath26 .",
    "the fixed point equations are , @xmath27 this means that @xmath28 is the normalized eigenvector of the evolution matrix @xmath29 with an eigenvalue of @xmath30 .",
    "once the steady state @xmath28 is calculated , it is possible to evaluate the steady - state average upward growth probability , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total upward growth probability for configuration @xmath7 .",
    "the average steady - state density of the aggregate is then given by @xmath33 here , the density is written explicitly as a function of @xmath0 . by @xmath34",
    "we denote the true value of the density , in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "we denote the result of the @xmath16th - order approximation by @xmath36 .",
    "as mentioned , the number of configurations grows exponentially with @xmath16 and @xmath0 , so it becomes infeasible to make the calculation for high values of @xmath16 and @xmath0 .",
    "we perform calculations for @xmath37 .",
    "the calculated densities and the number of configurations are presented in sec .",
    "[ enumerationsec ] .",
    "we find that in order to obtain a relative accuracy of about @xmath38 , it is necessary to go up to @xmath39 , or @xmath40 .",
    "this is achieved for @xmath41 , but for @xmath42 it is too heavy a task for our computer resources . in spite of this , we are able to successfully extrapolate @xmath16 to infinity for @xmath43 and @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated densities are compared to direct measurements from cylindrical site - dla simulations , and are found to be the same up to the accuracy of the simulation , which is about @xmath44 or better .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath45 is extracted from the assumption that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the euclidean dimension . in general one",
    "should also expect some corrections to scaling , especially for low @xmath0 s , i.e. , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are some constants , @xmath51 represents the leading correction exponent , and the dots stand for a series of higher powers of @xmath52 .",
    "this scaling hypothesis is validated by both the analytic enumeration computation and by the simulations , which were conducted up to @xmath53 .",
    "the best fit of such a model to the enumeration data results in an estimate of the fractal dimension of cylindrical dla in 2d , @xmath54 .",
    "the same fit is also performed with the simulation data , yielding @xmath55 .",
    "this is to be compared with the value @xmath56 often found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the differences between bond - dla and site - dla are manifested in the boundary conditions for the laplace equation , and in the way the growth probabilities are extracted from the potential @xmath13 .",
    "the boundary conditions at the top are , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vertical direction ( the growth direction ) , and @xmath59 denotes the periodic lateral direction .",
    "this describes a uniform flux of incoming particles . in the original dbm papers @xcite a uniform potential",
    "is used instead of a uniform gradient , but if the distant boundary is very far , then the differences between the solutions for the two cases is exponentially small @xcite .",
    "the determination of the boundary conditions on the aggregate should be done with care . in the case of bond - dla the potential",
    "is set to @xmath60 on the aggregate itself , while in site - dla the potential should be set to @xmath60 on nearest neighbors sites , i.e. , on sites where growth might occur .",
    "also , the derivation of the growth probabilities from the potential in site - dla is done a bit differently than in bond - dla , as explained in the next section .",
    "the laplace equation with these boundary conditions can be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "the idea is to divide the plane ( or space in higher dimensions ) into two parts : the upper part is an empty semi - infinite rectangle that begins at the row of the highest site on the lower boundary and continues upward ad infinitum .",
    "the lower boundary is the set of sites on which the potential @xmath13 is set to @xmath60 , and it depends on the type of sticking - conditions used : in the case of bond - sticking conditions the boundary is the aggregate itself , whereas in the case of site - sticking conditions it is the set of sites that are nearest neighbors to the aggregate .",
    "the lower part contains the aggregate and extends from the highest row downwards .",
    "the row that contains the highest particle in the aggregate is usually set as a reference row with @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in bond - dla , the upper part has @xmath62 , and the lower part has @xmath63 , and in site - dla , the upper part has @xmath64 , and the lower part has @xmath65 , as explained in more detail in sec .",
    "[ enumerationsec ] .",
    "note that in either case the dividing row is considered to belong to both parts .",
    "in the upper part , it is possible to express the potentials in row @xmath66 as a linear combination of those in row @xmath67 , @xmath68 this is especially useful for the bottom row of the upper part , @xmath61 or @xmath69 ( depending on the type of sticking conditions ) .",
    "the boundary green s function @xmath70 , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ phi(m+1,n)=1+sum ] ) , is given by @xmath71 the finite set of allowed wave - vectors @xmath72 for @xmath73 , is imposed by the horizontal periodicity .",
    "the factor @xmath74 is related to @xmath75 through the dispersion relation @xmath76 or more explicitly , @xmath77 an interesting property of the green s function is that @xmath78 this property was proved algebraically in ref .",
    "@xcite and was used in refs .",
    "@xcite to check the computations of the green s function .",
    "it is also used in the sample calculation of sec .",
    "[ samplecalculationssec ] in the current paper for the same purpose .",
    "usually , there is no general derivation for the solution in the lower part . in spite of that ,",
    "the number of sites in the lower part is finite and not too large , so it is possible to simply write the equations for each of the potentials .",
    "the solution of the resulting finite and linear set of equations is then straightforward .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ enumerationsec ] we present in detail the differences in the computation of the growth probabilities between bond and site sticking conditions .",
    "this presentation also explains the connection with the laplace equation more rigorously .",
    "after that we perform a few sample calculations , for @xmath2 and @xmath20 , in order to demonstrate the method presented in the introduction .",
    "we then report the results of the computations for @xmath0 between @xmath79 and @xmath80 for various orders of approximations @xmath16 .",
    "we point out that the results collapse onto a universal function that enables the extrapolation @xmath35 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath80 .",
    "this extrapolation reduces the error appreciably . in sec .",
    "[ simulationsec ] we present the simulation we made in order to verify our theoretical predictions .",
    "this presentation also explains how the boundary green s function @xmath70 is used in some way as a probability function , in order to make the simulation more efficient .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ summarysec ] .",
    "our computation method is referred to as enumeration , because it involves a systematic processing of some complete lists of configurations .      before proceeding with the actual calculations , we point out the differences in the computation of the growth probabilities between bond and site sticking conditions , because these differences are the essence of this paper . in order to point out the differences ,",
    "we first review the method for computing the growth probabilities with bond - sticking conditions .",
    "the first step is to solve the laplace equation ( [ laplace ] ) on a lattice , where the boundary conditions are @xmath83 on the aggregate , and @xmath84 on the distant boundary . in the case of cylindrical geometry",
    "there are periodic boundary conditions on the sides , see fig .",
    "[ dbmfig ] . the sticking probability per bond",
    "is then given by @xmath85 where the subscript @xmath86 refers to a perimeter bond and @xmath87 refers to the potential difference across such a bond . because the potential is null on the aggregate , this difference is equal to the value of the potential in a nearest neighbor site . finally , the growth probability per site is computed by multiplying the sticking probability per bond by the number of bonds associated with the site , @xmath88 , see fig .",
    "[ bondmultiplicityfig ] .",
    "why does this procedure give the exact growth probabilities ? in order to answer this question we must return to the original definition of dla , that involves a single random walker .",
    "the random walker is injected into a random site near the remote boundary and it diffuses until it attempts to penetrate the aggregate , in which case it gets stuck . by `` penetrate '' we mean that it is not sufficient for the random walker to be in a nearest neighbor site to the aggregate , but that it has to attempt to cross a perimeter bond in order for it to stick .",
    "a possible way of measuring the growth probabilities for a particular interface configuration is to send many random walkers , one after the other , and remove them after they stick .",
    "one has to keep track of how many particles get stuck in each site .",
    "eventually , the growth probabilities per site are estimated by the fraction of particles that got stuck in each site . instead of releasing the random walkers one at a time",
    ", it is more efficient to release many of them simultaneously , and let them perform a random walk without interacting with each other .",
    "moreover , instead of releasing a large amount of particles in a single batch and waiting until all of them stick , it is also possible to inject them at a constant rate near the boundary , i.e. , in each time step inject a new particle into each site near the boundary with a uniform probability @xmath89 .",
    "the advantage in this way of performing the measurement is that after an initial equilibration time the system arrives at a steady state , which is characterized by a time - independent average number of random walkers in all of the sites , including sites that are not near any of the boundaries . in the steady state",
    "the average number of random walkers entering into the system in each time step at the upper boundary is equal to the average number of random walkers vanishing out of the lower boundary .",
    "denote the average number of random walkers in each site in the steady - state by @xmath90 .",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath13 is time independent . in order to calculate @xmath13",
    "we note that it satisfies the discrete laplace equation @xmath91 because every random walker is equally probable to go to any one of its nearest neighbor sites .",
    "thus , on a general lattice ( or graph ) the laplace equation states that the value of @xmath13 at each site is equal to the mean value of @xmath13 on its nearest neighbor sites .",
    "special care should be give to sites near the boundaries .",
    "near the upper boundary each site has only three nearest neighbors , and particles are added at a constant rate @xmath89 , therefore , @xmath92+r&. \\label{topboundaryconditionseq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the last term on the left before @xmath89 is @xmath90 , instead of @xmath93 , because the particles that randomly choose to go up are unable to do so because of the boundary , and therefore they remain in the same place . now , let us define @xmath94 as a fictitious density above the boundary .",
    "then we see that eq .",
    "( [ topboundaryconditionseq ] ) turns into the standard laplace equation .",
    "this shows that instead of using the injection rate parameter @xmath89 , it is possible to use the regular laplace equation with the neumann type boundary conditions that require the specification of the electric field , which corresponds to the difference in the potential across the upper boundary .",
    "since the value of @xmath89 does not change the growth probabilities , we are free to choose any value for it . if , for example , we choose @xmath95 then the boundary conditions at the top are @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "we choose the upper boundary to be very far away from the lower one , because this simplifies the analytic expressions involved in the solution of the laplace equation , while leaving the sticking probabilities practically unchanged .    near the bottom boundary",
    "the situation is a bit different .",
    "each random walker that attempts to go into the aggregate is taken out of the system .",
    "the steady state equation for these sites is therefore @xmath98 where the sum is taken over all the sites @xmath99 that are nearest neighbors ( nn ) to @xmath100 . at the lower boundary the situation is similar , because once again , we obtain the regular laplace equation , if we choose the boundary conditions @xmath83 on the aggregate itself .",
    "the growth probability in each site is evaluated as the average number of random walkers that stick in that site per unit time , normalized by the total number of particles sticking in a time step across the total length of the lower boundary .",
    "an average of @xmath101 of the particles in a site choose to go in each direction .",
    "particularly , a fraction of @xmath101 of the particles vanish after choosing to go via bonds that connect to the aggregate .",
    "the average total number of particles sticking in a site would be a sum over all of its interface bonds , @xmath102 . in the steady - state ,",
    "the average total number of sticking random walkers is equal to the average total number of random walkers injected into the system . near the upper boundary @xmath95 random walkers are injected into each of the @xmath0 sites .",
    "therefore the normalization factor is @xmath103 and the growth probability in each site is @xmath104 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we arrive at the same result using the discrete gauss theorem .",
    "the situation in site - dla is different in the boundary conditions used near the aggregate , and in the expression for the growth probabilities .",
    "now , random walkers never arrive at sites that are nearest neighbors to the aggregate , because as soon as they do they get stuck and are immediately removed from the system .",
    "we therefore impose @xmath83 not on the aggregate itself , but rather on its nearest neighbor sites , see fig .",
    "[ sitepotentialsfig ] . in general , the boundary for the laplace equation is obtained by coating the aggregate with a layer of circled sites , as shown in the figure .",
    "this differentiates between the boundary of the aggregate itself and the boundary for the laplace equation , in the sense that it is possible that two different aggregates would have the same boundary for the laplace equation , see fig .",
    "[ boundariesfig ] .",
    "one can think that a random walker does not interact directly with the boundary of the aggregate , but rather , it interacts with the circled sites that make the boundary for the laplace equation .",
    "this means that a random walker that obeys site - sticking conditions can not be used as a probe in any way to determine which of the two aggregates in the figure are present .",
    "consequently , any two different aggregates that have the same boundary for the laplace equation must have the exact same set of growth probabilities and can be therefore considered as equivalent .",
    "thus , from now on when we refer to an interface configuration , we relate to the shape of the boundary for the laplace equation .",
    "the probability to be in such a configuration is a sum over all the underlying aggregate configurations .",
    "another effect of the transition to the laplace boundary is the narrowing of fjords .",
    "the padding of the aggregate by circled sites causes all the fjords to be narrower by two sites .",
    "thus , a random walker can only penetrate into aggregates that have branches that are at least three sites apart .    as in the case of bond - dla ,",
    "the sticking probabilities are evaluated as fractions of the average number of random walkers that stick per unit time . only now",
    ", we must sum over bonds that lead _ into _ the site , rather than out of it , as is the case in bond - dla .",
    "the growth probability per site is therefore , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the total sticking probability at the perimeter site @xmath100 , see fig .",
    "[ sitegrowthprobabilitiesfig ] .",
    "unlike the case of bond - sticking conditions , where a single potential determines the sticking probability in a particular site , now the potentials in several different sites contribute .",
    "this is because in bond - dla the random walker sticks before it moves out of the site , whereas in site - dla the random walker sticks after it moves into it .",
    "this difference gives the upper most tip of the aggregate even a greater advantage relative to bond - dla , because a single particle tip gathers contributions from three sides in site - dla , whereas in bond - dla the only contribution is from above .",
    "this comes in addition to the screening property of the laplace equation ( common to both types of sticking conditions ) , which causes the sticking probabilities at the lower parts of the interface to decrease exponentially .      the best way of explaining the enumeration method is by showing some sample calculations in detail .",
    "we present here the two simplest cases , namely , @xmath2 and @xmath20 . in these relatively simple cases",
    "there is only a finite number of configurations , so it is possible to get an exact solution with no need for approximations .    for @xmath2 , the interface of the aggregate itself has an infinite number of possible configurations , because it has the shape of a step whose height @xmath7 can be any nonnegative integer @xcite .",
    "however , in site - dla there are only two distinct states : @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the case @xmath107 refers to a flat interface , i.e. , the two columns have the same height , and a growth process will create a step with @xmath109 , with probability @xmath30 . for any step size",
    "@xmath108 there are only two sites where a random walker may stick : above the highest particle in the aggregate , or on its side , see fig .",
    "[ boundariesfig ] .",
    "there is no possibility for the random walker to penetrate into a fjord in @xmath2 , because it is too narrow , and the particle would stick at its entrance .",
    "the two configurations are indexed by @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively and are shown in fig .",
    "[ n2indexfig ] .",
    "we now begin building the evolution matrix @xmath29 , by finding the growth probabilities for each of the two configurations .",
    "as mentioned , configuration @xmath110 turns into @xmath111 with probability @xmath30 , hence @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "it is important to keep track of the total upward growth probability for each configuration , @xmath114 , that corresponds to events in which a newly stuck particle is higher than all of the particles in the aggregate . in this case",
    "@xmath115 .",
    "in order to solve for @xmath111 , we first have to compute the green s function according to eq .",

    "we therefore use the approximation scheme described in the introduction , which was also used for bond - dla @xcite .",
    "the calculation procedure involves going over all the possible configurations to some order , and calculating their set of growth probabilities .",
    "it is feasible to perform this task manually when the number of configurations is relatively small , but as @xmath0 and @xmath16 increase , the number of configurations grows exponentially and it becomes impractical to do so .",

    "the program identifies the index of the resultant configuration @xmath6 .",
    "now , if the index of the original configuration is @xmath7 , then the growth probability is stored in the matrix element @xmath11 .",
    "a configuration is characterized using the set of sites that are connected to infinity because these are the sites that are accessible to the random walker .",

    "this happens , the bottom row of the configuration is truncated . finally , symmetry has to be taken into account .",
    "rotations around the axis of the cylinder and reflections about any vertical axis do not change the growth probabilities or the steady - state weights , so the set of all of the symmetric configuration are represented by a single canonical choice .",
    "more specifically , a configuration is represented by a binary word that consists of @xmath185 digits that correspond to the sites ; the empty sites that are on the exterior are given a value of @xmath30 , and the rest of the sites are assigned with zeros .",

    "once more we apply the same reasoning and claim that ultimately the random walker would re - cross the line downwards at some point with probability @xmath30 . unlike the initial insertion , this time the distribution of the reentry point is not uniform .",

    "we thus evaluate @xmath34 as the average of the density profile over the plateau area . a possible way of estimating the accuracy of this average is by taking the standard deviation and normalizing by the square root of the number of rows that participate in the averaging .",
    "this is however , somewhat optimistic and would produce very low error estimates , because this calculation assumes statistical independence between adjacent rows , where in fact , there are significant correlations .",
    "the right factor to normalize by is therefore the square root of the effective number of independent rows .",
    "since the aggregate is fractal , the only available length - scale is @xmath0 , and therefore the correlation length @xmath280 should be proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore conservatively guess that two rows that are @xmath0 rows apart are independent , and hence estimate the accuracy by the standard deviation divided by @xmath281 , because there are @xmath80 blocks of @xmath265 is the steady state region .",

    "( [ rho(n)approx2 ] ) is @xmath309 , @xmath310 , @xmath311 and @xmath312 . in this approximation ,",
    "the residuals are not lowered drastically ; the maximal relative residual is @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "the error estimate of fourth parameter @xmath315 is much greater than the error estimates of the other parameters .",
    "the contribution of the term with the @xmath315 parameter is on the same order of magnitude as the residuals , at least for the data point with large @xmath0 s .",
    "this implies that there may be significant contributions from the noise ( the errors ) in these data points to the parameter , and therefore its inclusion is redundant .",
    "in this paper , we continue our endeavour to solve cylindrical dla analytically , i.e , to calculate the steady state average density @xmath26 , as a function of the cylinder width @xmath0 , and to find the fractal dimension @xmath45 .",
    "unlike our previous work , which deals with bond - sticking conditions @xcite , this work solves for site - sticking conditions .",
    "the immediate problem in following our markovian method is that , except for @xmath316 , there is usually an infinite number of configurations .",
    "the case @xmath21 has an infinite number of configurations , but is still relatively simple .",
    "the large variety of possible complex interface shapes for @xmath317 prevents the inclusion of all the configurations and compels the use of an approximation scheme , in which only a finite number of rows @xmath16 of the growing front near the tip are included .",
    "this approximation works because of the exponential decay of the laplace potential @xmath13 inside deep fjords .",
    "the approximation leaves a finite number of configurations to work with , and thus the computational procedure can be completed .",
    "we find that this is a well controlled approximation , in the sense that any desired numerical accuracy can be achieved provided that a high enough order of approximation @xmath16 is used .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ enumerationtresultstab ] , that shows the computed density @xmath318 for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath16 along with the number of relevant configuration @xmath193 .",
    "an evident fact is that @xmath193 grows very rapidly as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath0 , making it impractical to perform the calculation for wide cylinders .",
    "we note that in order to obtain the same relative accuracy it is necessary to use @xmath319 , e.g. , in order to obtain a relative accuracy better than @xmath38 one should use at least @xmath40 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath320 , where the results are very accurate , but not so for @xmath321 , where our available computer resources allowed only lower order computations . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ otoinfinitysec ] , we are able to improve the estimates in these cases by extrapolating @xmath322 , taking advantage of the universal exponential decay of @xmath220 with the scaled variable @xmath323 .",
    "table [ enumerationtresultstab ] also compares the enumeration estimates with direct measurements from simulations , and finds them to agree within the simulation errors .",
    "once accurate estimates are obtained for @xmath34 for @xmath37 , they are fitted to a power - law approximation with a correction to scaling term according to eq .",
    "( [ rho(n)approx1 ] ) . the fit ( with @xmath244 ) gives an estimate of the fractal dimension @xmath54 .    besides the range @xmath324 , simulations are also performed on cylinders with larger @xmath0 s in the range @xmath325 .",
    "the relative errors of the measurements of @xmath34 are estimated around @xmath38 .",
    "the simulation data are also fitted to the same approximations .",
    "once again , the three parameter approximation proves most appropriate and the resulting fractal dimension this time is @xmath326 .",
    "the fact that the enumeration and simulation based estimates of the fractal dimension are very close is a good indication of their accuracy .",
    "the last statement should be taken with some caution in light of evidence that raises doubts concerning self - similarity in radial dla @xcite , or suggesting some very slow crossovers @xcite .",
    "indeed , radial dla is somewhat different than cylindrical dla , as manifested by the difference between their fractal dimensions : @xmath327 for radial dla @xcite and @xmath328 for cylindrical dla ( this difference is still not fully understood ) .",
    "we also tried performing the exact calculations for @xmath329 and @xmath330 , but managed to go only up to @xmath331 .",
    "this was insufficient for extrapolation with an accuracy that is comparable to the rest of the data points . with the aid of stronger computers",
    "we think that it would be possible and beneficial to compute a few more data points @xmath34 , which would help obtaining more accurate estimates of the fractal dimension .",
    "also , the techniques discussed here could be used to find the fractal dimension of cylindrical dla in 3d .",
    "however , since a much larger number of configurations can be expected , this task would also probably require the aid of a very strong computer .",
    "there are a few differences between site - dla and bond - dla : the boundary conditions for the laplace equation are a little bit different ; in bond - dla the potential is set to zero on the aggregate itself , whereas in site - dla the potential is set to zero on sites that are nearest neighbors of the aggregate .",
    "also , the growth probabilities are computed somewhat differently ; in bond - dla contributions are summed over bonds that go out of a site where sticking may occur , whereas they are summed over bond that go into it in site - dla .",
    "the normalization factor , however , is equal to the width @xmath0 is both cases . in the case of site sticking conditions",
    "there is an effective thickening of branches and thus a narrowing of fjords .",
    "thus , there is a notable decrease in the probability of a random walker to penetrate deep into fjords .",
    "this also causes the number of configurations for a particular choice of @xmath0 and @xmath16 to be considerably less for site - dla in comparison with bond - dla .",
    "therefore , accurate enumeration results can be obtained for larger @xmath0 s and @xmath16 s in site - dla .",
    "the extrapolation @xmath194 performed in this paper was not done in ref .",
    "@xcite , which deals with bond - dla , because the technique was not developed at that time .",
    "when we apply the method to the bond - dla case , we manage to improve the relative accuracy of the highest available approximations , @xmath332 for @xmath333 by an order of magnitude : from about @xmath334 to @xmath335 for @xmath189 , and from @xmath336 to @xmath337 .",
    "this extrapolation is based on the data points for @xmath190 .",
    "the relative accuracy of @xmath332 for @xmath338 is better than @xmath38 and hence , the extrapolation is not necessary .",
    "the estimate of the fractal dimension for site - dla is , @xmath246 , to be compared with the bond - dla enumeration result @xmath232 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the difference in the simulation results for the two cases is smaller : @xmath339 for site - dla and @xmath328 for bond - dla . given the uncertainties , our results are consitent with universality with respect to the sticking conditions @xcite .",
