    "since many decades model atmospheres have been a fundamental tool to understand the physical nature of the pn central stars and the ionization and emission of their surrounding nebulae . after the pioneering work by aller ( 1948 ) , which revealed the importance and enormous potential of cspn spectroscopy , and heap ( 1977 , and references therein ) , which provided the first quantitative spectral analyses based on model atmospheres , the field was advanced by mndez et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , kudritzki and mndez ( 1987 ) , mndez et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . in this work ,",
    "high quality spectra obtained with new 4m - class telescopes and very efficient spectrographs and detectors were analyzed in detail using a new generation of hydrostatic , planeparallel nlte model atmospheres to determine effective temperatures , gravities and helium abundances .",
    "this work demonstrated nicely that o - type cspn form an evolutionary sequence in the ( log g , log t@xmath1)-plane and that the gravities and temperatures determined spectroscopically could be used to estimate stellar masses , radii , luminosities and distances by comparison with the prediction of post - agb evolution and the core mass - luminosity relationship .    while this new concept seemed compelling , there were clear indications of quantitative deficiencies .",
    "the masses determined seemed systematically larger than white dwarf masses and some of the objects ( such as ngc 2392 ) had unrealistically high masses .",
    "the model atmospheres used , though in nlte and certainly state - of - the art , did not include the opacities of metal lines and they also neglected the effects of stellar winds and spherical extension , which were suspected to be substantial , in particular for cooler objects , where the gravities are lower , and more massive objects , which are closer to the eddington limit .    indeed , perinotto ( 1987 ) and",
    "kudritzki and mndez ( 1987 ) stressed the importance of stellar winds not only for the evolution of cspn but also for their diagnostics . with a new generation of `` unified model atmospheres '' , which included the effects of stellar winds and spherical extension ,",
    "many cspn were re - analysed and , indeed , somewhat lower masses were found ( kudritzki and mndez , 1992 , kudritzki et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , the mechanical momenta of the stellar winds determined were in rough agreement with general scaling relations obtained from the theory of radiation driven winds and compared to the momenta of massive o - stars , however the scatter around this relationship was large .",
    "the major remaining model atmosphere deficiency at this stage was the neglect of metal line opacity , which - if included - needed to be calculated in nlte , certainly a formidable problem .",
    "this problem has been overcome in recent years and a wide variety of very efficient model atmosphere codes does exist now taking into account effects of millions of metal lines in nlte and the velocity fields of stellar winds together with spherical extension .",
    "these new codes allow for detailed studies of the uv spectra and a re - analysis of the optical spectrum now with the inclusion of line - blanketing .",
    "this is the subject of the review presented here .",
    "we will focus on low gravity , relatively cool o - type cspn .",
    "wr - type objects and objects of higher gravity are discussed in other reviews of these proceedings .",
    "a significant number of good uv - spectra of cspn obtained with iue , hst , and recently with fuse are available .",
    "many of them show the signatures of stellar winds through broad p - cygni profiles of resonance lines , which are frequently used to determine terminal velocities of the stellar winds and estimates of mass - loss rates . however , the latter are usually very uncertain , either because the wind lines are strongly saturated or because the ionization equlibria in the wind are uncertain and affected , for instance , by the presence of soft x - rays and euv radiation emitted in stellar wind shocks",
    ".    on the other hand , there are also thousands of photospheric metal lines in the uv spectra of cspn and their analysis provides independent means to determine effective temperatures through photospheric ionization equilibria such as feiv / v .",
    "they also allow for an accurate determination of stellar metallicity .",
    "pauldrach et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and herald and bianchi ( 2004a ) have carried out such studies and determined temperatures and metallicities for a larger sample of cspn . compared to mndez et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) this work generally confirms the effective temperatures derived from the optical line spectrum .",
    "this is important in the cases of those cspn , which have a much higher heii `` zanstra - temperature '' ( the standard example is ngc 2392 ) .",
    "the uv work makes it clear that the high nebular ionization observed in these cases is not caused by a central star with an extremely high atmospheric temperature .",
    "the downside of the `` photospheric '' uv - work is that it does not allow for a direct spectroscopic determination of stellar gravities .",
    "thus , if not combined with optical spectroscopy , there is no direct spectroscopic way to determine masses , radii , and luminosities .",
    "this is only possible , if independent assumptions about the distance are made .",
    "a beautiful example is the work by herald and bianchi ( 2004b ) of 7 lmc cspn . assuming a distance to the lmc , the determination of t@xmath1 from the uv spectrum allows to determine radii , luminosities and , then , with post - agb evolution , stellar masses .",
    "very convincingly , the authors obtain stellar masses between 0.55 and 0.65 m@xmath2 .",
    "pauldrach et al . (",
    "2004 ) use a very interesting different approach . realizing that the theory of radiation driven winds predicts a strong dependence of mass - loss rates and terminal velocities on stellar luminosity and stellar mass ( see kudritzki and puls , 2000 , and references therein )",
    ", they use a concept first worked out by kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to determine stellar masses and luminosities from the observed terminal velocities and the uv - mass - loss rates .",
    "they study the same cspn sample as kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and obtain very similar effective temperatures .",
    "but for many objects , the masses and luminosities are significantly different leading to the conclusion that either the stellar wind hydrodynamics or the core mass - luminosity relationship of post - agb evolution , which was the basis for the work by kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , are not completely accurate .    the second conclusion ,",
    "if true , would have enormous repercussions for the interpretation of post - agb evolution .",
    "looking critically at the results obtained by pauldrach et al . , we note that only two of their nine objects have masses below 0.8 m@xmath2 , five have masses between 1.3 and 1.4 m@xmath2 just below the chandrasekhar limit , and two are in between . for a number of reasons that seems to be in conflict with galactic evolution and dynamics ( see napiwotzki , 2006 )",
    ". we also note that in their determination of mass - loss rates pauldrach et al .",
    "( as kudritzki et al . ) assumed homogeneous , unclumped winds , an assumption which might not be justified , as we will discuss later .",
    "a re - analysis of the optical spectra of these cspn , now using blanketed models , can perhaps help to clarify the situation .",
    "this will also be described later .",

    "the inclusion of the opacity of millions of spectral lines in nlte has two major effects .",
    "first , it changes the spectral energy distribution in the uv because of strong metal line absorption in the outer atmosphere ( `` line - blanketing '' ) .",
    "however , about 50 percent of the photons absorbed are scattered back to the inner photosphere providing additional energy input and , thus , heating of the deeper photospheres .",
    "this second `` backwarming '' effect increases the continuum emission from the photosphere and modifies ionization equilibria such as hei / ii , which are used for the determination of t@xmath1 .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrates how the hei / ii ionization equlibrium is shifted towards lower t@xmath1 because of the backwarming effect . at the same time , the pressure - broadened wings of the balmer lines ( the standard diagnostic for log g ) become weaker , because the millions of metal lines increase the radiative acceleration g@xmath5 and decrease the effective gravity g@xmath1 = g - g@xmath5 . as a result higher",
    "gravities are needed to fit the balmer lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) in addition to the lower temperatures obtained from the helium ionization equlibrium . in summary ,",
    "the use of blanketed models leads to systematic shifts in the ( log g , log t@xmath1 ) - plane , which if compared with post - agb evolutionary tracks result in systematically lowering cspn masses , radii , luminosities and distances .",
    "note that the presence of dense stellar wind envelopes increases the effects of backwarming and introduce an additional dependence on mass - loss rates ( see sellmaier et al .",
    ", 1993 , repolust et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the combined effects of line blanketing and backwarming affect also the ionizing fluxes .",
    "amazingly , for the ionization of hydrogen the changes are very small as the effects of blanketing and backwarming balance each other . however , the ionization of ions with absorption edges shorter than the one for hydrogen is significantly affected ( see kudritzki , 2002 , martins et al . , 2005 ) .",

    "the significant effects caused by nlte line - blanketing make it worthwhile to re - analyse the optical spectra of the sample studied by kudritzki et al .",
    "this will also allow for a comparison with the uv - study carried out by pauldrach et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discussed above . for our analysis",
    "we use the nlte code fastwind ( puls et al . , 2005 ) , which includes the effects of nlte metal line opacities , stellar winds , and spherical extension .",
    "the strategy for the analysis is identical to kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( see also repolust et al . , 2004 , for more recent work ) .",
    "t@xmath8 and helium abundance are obtained from a fit of the hei and heii lines , while the gravity is determined from the higher balmer lines .",
    "h@xmath0 as the strongest optical hydrogen line is formed in the stellar wind and , thus , used to constrain the mass - loss rate .",
    "the terminal velocity follows from fits of the uv p - cygni lines .",
    "while h@xmath0 is , in principle , a perfect tool to measure mass - loss rates ( see kudritzki and puls , 2000 , kudritzki , 2006 , for discussion and references ) , the results might be affected by stellar wind clumping .",
    "it has been known since long that line driven winds are intrinsically unstable ( owocki et al . , 1988 , 2004 ) .",
    "this might lead to inhomogeneous , clumped winds such as described by owocki and runacres ( 2002 ) with regions of enhanced density @xmath9 and regions , where the density is much lower . in a very simple description , introducing clumping factors @xmath10 similar as in pn diagnostics , the relationship between the average density of the stellar wind flow @xmath11 and the density in the clumps is then given by @xmath12 .",
    "the same relationship holds for the occupation numbers @xmath13 of ions .",
    "line opacities @xmath14 depend on density through @xmath15 and for very small , optically thin clumps the avarage optical line depth in the wind is given by @xmath16 . for a dominating ionization stage",
    "we have @xmath17 and the clumping along the line of sight cancels and does not affect the diagnostics . however , bound hydrogen is a minor ionization stage in hot stars depending on recombination from ionized hydrogen with @xmath18 .",
    "thus , if @xmath10 is significantly larger than one , the h@xmath0 mass - loss rate diagnostic is systematically affected and we have @xmath19 , following from the fact that @xmath20    the spectral diagnostics of clumping in cspn is difficult . in principle , it requires the comparison of lines with different exponents x in the density dependence of their opacities . in wr - type cspn with very dense winds and very strong wind emission lines ( see these proceedings or hamann et al . , 2001 )",
    "incoherent electron scattering produces wide emission wings , the strength of which goes with @xmath21 .",
    "clumping factors of the order of ten to twenty were found .",
    "this technique does not work for o - type cspn , as their winds have much lower density .",
    "also the uv p - cygni lines of dominating ions provide usually little help , as these lines are mostly saturated and the ionization equlibria are uncertain .",
    "however , in most recent work on massive o - stars using fuse and copernicus spectra the pv resonance line at 1118 and 1128   has been used as an indicator of clumping .",
    "the advantage of pv is the low cosmic abundance so that the line is completely unsaturated even when in a dominating ionization stage .",
    "substantial clumping was found ( hillier et al . , 2003 , bouret et al . , 2005 ,",
    "fullerton et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "unfortunately , only a few useful fuse spectra are available for our sample .",
    "we have , therefore , applied a different technique to constrain clumping , at least for a subset of our objects .    for cool o - type cspn with t@xmath22 k heii",
    "is a dominant ionization stage .",
    "that means for objects with strong winds and heii 4686 in emission and formed in the wind this line should have a density dependence close to @xmath23 .",
    "its relative strenght to h@xmath0 should allow to constrain f@xmath24 .    in the following we present the results of this new work .",
    "for lack of space we do not show typical example of the fits of lines which constrain t@xmath8 , log g , and the helium abundance and refer to kudritzki et al .",
    "[ fig2 ] demonstrates in our most extreme case how @xmath10 is constrained .",
    "@xmath6 leads to by far too strong emission of heii 4686 relative to h@xmath0 . a very large value of @xmath7",
    ", however , improves the fit significantly .",
    "[ fig3 ] gives an example of the other extreme where a homogeneous wind with @xmath6 results in a very satisfactory fit .",
    "a summary of all results is given in tab .",
    "note that the last column indicates the three cases where we were able to constrain @xmath10 . in the other cases ,",
    "either nebular emission did not allow for a determination ( tc 1 ) or the objects were too hot for the method to be applicable .",
    ".stellar parameters of cspn analyzed [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "comparing our results to pauldrach et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we find reasonable agreement for the effective temperatures for all cases ( except he 2 - 108 , which we find to be 17 percent cooler ) .",
    "this is very satisfying given the fact that different spectroscopic techniques were used for the determination of t@xmath1 .",
    "however , in all but one case ( he 2 - 131 ) the gravities obtained through our fitting of the balmer lines are substantially lower .",
    "if one corrects for the temperature dependence of the balmer lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and the slightly different temperatures obtained , our gravities are on average 0.3 dex smaller .",
    "the reason is clearly the completely different approach used to determine gravities , as explained in section 2 .",
    "pauldrach et al .",
    "rely on the hydrodynamic simulation of stellar winds , whereas we have have used the classical spectroscopic concept of balmer line fitting .",
    "this will need further investigation .    for the determination of masses , radii , luminosities , and distances we have used again the classical approach of using the post - agb core mass - luminosity relationship .",
    "compared to kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) our masses are generally smaller in agreement with what we expect from section 3 , however some of them ( ic 418 , ngc 2392 ) are still uncomfortably high .",
    "the mass loss rates determined are uncertain because of the effects of stellar wind clumping . however , if we take into account that mass - loss rates determined with h@xmath0 scale with the stellar radius adopted as @xmath25 ( kudritzki and puls , 2000 ) and compare with pauldrach et al .",
    "we find agreement within a factor of two except for ic 418 .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the cspn wind momenta of our study compared to massive o - stars .",
    "there are two ways to interprete this plot .",
    "one is that cspn form a convincing extension of the wind momentum - luminosity relationship of massive o - stars towards lower luminosities .",
    "another one is that within the luminosity range of cspn alone there is no clear relationship between wind momentum and luminosity ( see also tinkler and lamers , 2002 ) . whether this is because of",
    "the uncertainties of mass - loss rate diagnostics or of the luminosity determinations , or both , will need further investigation .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result with stellar wind models obtained with the theory of line driven winds .",
    "this is also done in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we use the method by kudritzki ( 2002 ) to calculate wind momenta for the cspn of tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] . with a few exceptions the theoretical momenta are in the right ballpark .",
    "several steps need to be undertaken for future work .",
    "the first is to extend the work presented here and to re - analyse the uv - spectra of the sample and to compare in detail to see whether or not the results obtained from the two spectral windows are compatible , in this way addressing the original point made by pauldrach et al .",
    "taking into account the effects of clumping through the diagnostics of the pv and similar lines will be crucial .",
    "a very important issue is the compatibility of stellar wind hydrodynamics with the stellar parameters derived by our method . while the wind momenta seem to agree within the observational errors , the terminal velocities calculated are too small in many cases for the parameters obtained by us",
    "whether this is a deficiency of stellar wind hydrodynamics or of the balmer line diagnostics used , remains to be investigated .",
    "we note that one modification to be made in the wind hydrodynamics is the inclusion of clumping factors",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether this will help to resolve the discrepancy ."
