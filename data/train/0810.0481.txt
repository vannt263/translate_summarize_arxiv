    "the low energy limit of string theory compactified to four dimensions is often described in terms of an effective supergravity which generically develops classical flat directions .",
    "understanding the leading corrections from string loops and non - perturbative effects is therefore crucial for addressing questions such as moduli stabilization , supersymmetry breaking or cosmological evolution in these models .",
    "although a non - perturbative description of string theory is still far from being at our disposal , the rich network of dualities allows , already at this stage , to make some explicit computations in simple models .",
    "precisely , type i / heterotic s - duality @xcite maps stringy instanton effects due to euclidean 1-branes ( e1-branes ) , into string loop effects in a dual heterotic model .",
    "whereas in ten dimensions s - duality is a strong - weak coupling duality , in four dimensions it is manifested as an electric - magnetic duality , making the mapping between both effective theories straightforward .    in this contribution",
    "we mainly summarize some of the results of @xcite , where the structure of multi - instanton and string loop corrections in a simple class of models were obtained . concretely",
    ", we consider type i string theory compactified on toroidal orbifolds , and use type i / heterotic s - duality to extract the corrections to the khler potential and the gauge kinetic function , coming from string loop and multi - instanton effects associated with @xmath0 subsectors of the theory .",
    "additional related material and a more detailed exposition can be found in @xcite .",
    "a simple way to extract corrections to the khler potential , @xmath1 , and the gauge kinetic function , @xmath2 , of the effective theory is to look at the one - loop physical gauge couplings . in a heterotic compactification ,",
    "these read , @xmath3 with @xmath4 the linear multiplet associated with the dilaton , @xmath5 the string scale , @xmath6 the moduli of the compactification and @xmath7 the normalization of the gauge group generators , determined by the level of the corresponding kac - moody algebra .",
    "the @xmath8-function coefficient , @xmath9 , is given in terms of the quadratic casimir invariants of the gauge group , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the number of matter multiplets in the representation @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , in field theory the physical gauge couplings are given as @xcite , @xmath13 where det @xmath14 is the determinant of the tree - level khler metric associated with the matter multiplets in the representation @xmath12 , @xmath15 the tree - level khler potential for the moduli @xmath6 and @xmath16 .    in order to compare ( [ thresgeneral ] ) and ( [ field ] ) ,",
    "we recall the relation between the usual complex axion - dilaton @xmath17 and the linear multiplet @xmath4 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 a gauge group independent ( `` universal '' ) function which , for convenience , we split in to its harmonic and non - harmonic parts , @xmath20 the khler potential and the gauge - kinetic function of the effective theory then are given to one - loop by @xcite @xmath21",
    "we focus on type i toroidal orbifold compactifications which admit a weakly coupled perturbative description in terms of heterotic string theory .",
    "more precisely , we consider models where the orbifold action , @xmath22 , contains some subgroup , @xmath23 , which leaves unrotated some complex plane , and therefore there is a @xmath0 sector of the theory associated to each of such subgroups .",
    "this includes @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 orbifold models .",
    "the gauge threshold corrections can be computed in the heterotic side along the lines of @xcite and take the expression , @xmath30 where the sum runs over the disjoint union of @xmath0 subsectors , each leaving invariant a single complex plane with khler and complex structure moduli @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the gauge group is given by a product @xmath33 . the explicit expression for the toroidal lattice sums , @xmath34 ,",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath35 is an almost holomorphic modular function which is constrained by modular invariance and @xmath0 supersymmetry to have the structure , @xmath36\\ , \\label{index}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 the @xmath8-function coefficient of the @xmath0 gauge theory associated to a would - be @xmath38 orbifold and @xmath39 a gauge group independent coefficient .",
    "definitions for the eisenstein series , @xmath40 , and the modular covariant derivative , @xmath41 , can be found e.g. in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "for the sake of clarity , let us briefly consider the simplest case of a single @xmath0 sector .",
    "this corresponds to the well known case of type i string theory compactified on @xmath42 . in order to cancel anomalies ,",
    "24 instantons are required . in the @xmath43 orbifold limit of the @xmath44",
    "@xcite these are manifest as 8 d5-branes and 16 @xmath45 bundles hidden at the 16 orbifold singularities .",
    "the d5-branes together with the 16 d9-branes also present , lead to a maximal gauge group @xmath46 .    in the coulomb branch of this setup , where a half d5-brane is located at each of the 16 fixed points , only the @xmath47 gauge group from the d9-branes remains massless because of the green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "the spectrum is given by four hypermultiplets , containing the moduli of the @xmath44 , three vector multiplets containing the axion - dilaton and the moduli of the @xmath48 , a @xmath49 , and sixteen @xmath50 from the d5-d9 modes .",
    "in this particular point of the moduli space the weakly coupled so(32 ) heterotic dual therefore does not contain @xmath51-branes , and can be worked out explicitly @xcite .",
    "this is given by a @xmath52 orbifold with shift vector @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath54 in eq.([index ] ) .",
    "more generically , the condition @xmath55 is related to points in the moduli space where a dual description can be given in terms of perturbative @xmath56 heterotic string compactified on a @xmath57 , with no wilson lines , and instanton numbers @xmath58 , with @xmath59 @xcite . in the above coulomb branch ,",
    "we hence obtain instanton numbers @xmath60 , and we are sitting at the point where the moduli spaces of perturbative so(32 ) and @xmath56 heterotic strings intersect .",
    "the integral ( [ integral ] ) can be evaluated using the methods of @xcite , which consists of dividing @xmath61 into orbits under the modular group and evaluating the resulting integral for each orbit representative in a suitable unfolded region of the upper complex half - plane . putting all pieces together and making use of eqs.([k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] )",

    "the argument is defined as @xmath69 , corresponding to the complex structure induced in the worldvolume of the e1-instantons @xcite , as will be clear below .",
    "several comments for the @xmath43 orbifold limit of k3 , where the type i / so(32 ) heterotic duality is explicit , are in order :    * _ one - loop @xmath70 corrections to the khler potential and the gauge kinetic function .",
    "_ these are given by eq.([kloop ] ) and the logarithmic term in eq.([fa ] ) .",
    "these expressions were also obtained by direct computation in the type i side in @xcite . in our context , these corrections come respectively from non - holomorphic and holomorphic terms in contributions of degenerate orbits under the modular group . * _ tree - level contribution to the gauge kinetic function . _ because d9-branes are fractional , the gauge kinetic function receives an extra contribution proportional to , @xmath71)}\\ t\\ , \\ ] ] where the sum runs over the @xmath72 singularities and @xmath73 $ ] is the pull - back to the collapsed 2-cycle of the singularity . in the orbifold limit ,",
    "the volume of the 2-cycle is zero and the contribution from the metric vanishes .",
    "however , the u(1 ) instantons hidden at the singularities @xcite lead to a non - trivial linear term in @xmath74 in the gauge kinetic function of the d9-branes . *",
    "_ non - perturbative @xmath75 multi - instanton corrections to the khler potential and the gauge kinetic function .",
    "_ they appear as the polyakov action of an instanton wrapping @xmath76 times the @xmath77-th 2-torus , weighted by a modular function of @xmath78 and summed over @xmath79 and all the possible wrappings . + in order for the instantons to contribute to the gauge kinetic function , only four fermionic neutral zero modes should be massless ( corresponding to the `` goldstinos '' ) @xcite .",
    "a @xmath45 instanton on top of a singularity behaves as a `` gauge '' instanton for the u(1 ) gauge theory inside the corresponding half d5-brane .",
    "these instantons are analogous to the ones discussed in @xcite , with the extra fermionic zero modes lifted by couplings with the d5-branes ( see also @xcite )",
    ". therefore they should be responsible for the 1-instanton contribution .",
    "notice however that in this case there is also a higgs branch which consists of moving the instanton out of the singularity , leading to a so(1 ) instanton ( plus its image under the orbifold ) . in this limit",
    ", the instanton has too many zero modes and does not correct the gauge kinetic function .",
    "+ similarly , for the @xmath79-instanton contribution , in a generic point of the moduli space the instanton gauge group is @xmath80 , and has too many zero modes . only in the special locus on which all the components of the multi - instanton are on top of the singularity and the gauge group",
    "is enhanced to @xmath81 , four zero modes survive , with the extra zero modes presumably lifted by interactions with the d5-branes .",
    "explicit examples where instantons only contribute in a given locus of their moduli space have been discussed in detail in the recent literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "understanding the leading corrections to the low energy effective theory in generic compactifications would constitute an important input for addressing phenomenological and cosmological questions within string theory",
    ". it would be therefore very interesting to extend these results to more involved and phenomenologically relevant string theory setups .",
    "for that , a better understanding of the blow - up modes or the ns5-brane in heterotic string theory are certainly desirable .",
    "we hope that the effort along those lines will continue to be pursued in the near future .",
    "i thank my collaborator e.  dudas , for illuminating discussions and ideas during the elaboration of @xcite and afterwards .",
    "also i thank m. lennek and m. trapletti for useful comments , and the organizers of the ichep08 conference , in particular those of the formal theory session , where this talk was presented .",
