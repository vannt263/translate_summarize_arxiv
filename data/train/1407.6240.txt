    "<S> +    the integration of a perpendicular polarizer with an in - plane mtj permitted to realize a subnanosecond bipolar reversal of the sl magnetization . for practical devices , the stt contributions from the in - plane analyzer and perpendicular polarizer must be tuned so that the pp can still provide the initial impulse which reduces the stochasticity of the switching but the final state is controlled by the current direction in the stack independently of the pulse duration . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by increasing the aspect ratio of the cell above @xmath47 . </S>",
