    "away from all full and fractional quantum resonances ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are integers ) dynamical localization suppresses the rotational energy growth .",

    "the shape of the observable wave packet depends on the overlap between these quasienergy states , whose spectrum is dictated by the pulse train period , and the initial rotational distribution of molecules @xcite . in a recent experimental demonstration of dl in laser - kicked molecules , we showed an exponentially localized wave function near the ( initially most populated ) rotational ground state @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrated a shifting of the localization center towards higher energies by applying a periodic pulse train to a previously prepared coherent superposition of rotational states and controlling the relative phases between the states @xcite .    here , we study an alternative route to control the final rotational distribution by varying the period of the applied sequence of laser pulses .",
