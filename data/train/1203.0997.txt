    "during a collapse , leading to a formation of a neutron star , the matter passes states with very high temperatures and densities , and intensive birth of neutrino .",
    "while in the hot core of the new born neutron star the neutrino opacity is large enough , to establish a thermodynamic equilibrium to beta processes , the regions outside the neutrinosphere are almost transparent to neutrino , so the thermodynamic equilibrium can not be established .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that the characteristic time of the neutrino processes outside the neutrinosphere can be much smaller than the characteristic hydrodynamic time . in this",
    "conditions the kinetic equilibrium is established , so that the ratio between neutrons and protons is determined by the conditions of the kinetic equilibrium , where the birth rate of protons ( neutrons ) in equal to its death rate . the detailed investigation of the kinetic equilibrium for the pure nucleonic @xmath8 gas had been done numerically in @xcite for a general case .",
    "particular cases of the kinetic @xmath0 equilibrium in a cold @xmath9 , and a hot @xmath10 gases have been considered numerically in @xcite , where the author described the kinetic @xmath0 equilibrium approximately , in terms of the relations between the chemical potentials of nucleon and pairs , similar to @xcite .",
    "the precision of this approach is rather moderate at high densities .",
    "here the same problem is considered for the case of ultrarelativistic pairs with non - relativistic and non - degenerate nucleons .",
    "this case is considered without any other simplifications , and occurs to be rather simple , due to analytic connection of the matter density @xmath6 with the chemical potential of the electrons @xmath11 , found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "let us consider kinetic equilibrium for ultrarelativistic pairs to the following processes    @xmath12    @xmath13 the probabilities of the reactions ( [ rc ] ) for infinitely heavy nucleons are written as @xcite    @xmath14    @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the characteristic value for the neutron decay .",
    "the integrals @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined as    @xmath19    @xmath20 here    @xmath21 @xmath22 for the positrons the chemical potential @xmath23 . in the upper integral ( [ int ] )",
    "let us define ( @xmath24 ) , and in the lower one ( @xmath25 ) , ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the electron(positron ) momentum .    in the ultrarelativistic plasma @xmath28 in the case ( a ) , and @xmath29 in the case ( b ) .",
    "therefore the integrals ( [ int ] ) are reduced to    @xmath30    @xmath31 introducing fermi integrals    @xmath32    let us write the integrals in ( [ int1 ] ) as    @xmath33    @xmath34 in presence of ultrarelativistic pairs in thermodynamic equilibrium , there is an analytic expression , connecting the non - dimensional chemical potential @xmath0 with the matter density @xmath6 , temperature @xmath7 , and the number of nucleons per one original electron @xmath35 in the nucleonic medium , written as @xcite    @xmath36",

    "the equation of the kinetic beta equilibrium is written as    @xmath37    in the ultrarelativistic case thermodynamic functions as functions of @xmath38 and @xmath7 depend on the combination @xmath39 . introducing a non - dimensional variable    @xmath40    it follows from ( [ eos ] ) and ( [ kbe ] ) the equation , determining a dependence @xmath41 in the conditions of the kinetic beta equilibrium    @xmath42    where the integrals @xmath43 and @xmath44 are defined in ( [ int2 ] ) .",
