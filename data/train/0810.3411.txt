    "we present here our most recent results for a qcd motivated description of the total cross - section @xcite .",
    "the qcd contribution to the rise in the total cross - section had been advocated @xcite soon after the isr results indicated that the total cross - sections were increasing with energy by about 10% above their previous values obtained in fixed target experiments .",
    "subsequently , in order to incorporate the qcd contribution as well as to satisfy unitarity , use was made of the eikonal representation , with the impact parameter distribution obtained from the hadronic form factors @xcite .",
    "although the rise of the total cross - section was correctly identified as being due to the rising number of low - x gluon collisions , these models were usually unable to describe the gentle rise of the cross - section , and were not able to really connect with the rich jet phenomenology and the description of parton - parton scattering .",
    "our aim has been to cure both of the above problems .",
    "first we have concentrated on calculating the so called mini - jet cross - sections through most commonly used dglap evoluted parton densities@xcite , and then we have added soft gluon emission from initial state valence quarks to introduce acollinearity in parton - parton scattering . soft gluon emission in @xmath0 -space is naturally energy dependent , thus curing one of the problems of the description in terms of hadronic form factors .",
    "the other important difference with existing models , lies in our treatment of the infrared region .",
    "the model in fact takes its name from the bloch - nordsiek ( bn ) theorem in qed , and its requirement of emission of an indefinite number of soft quanta .",
    "when the qed re - summation procedure is transported to qcd , one encounters the problem of the infrared behaviour of the running coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "we believe that the contribution from the infrared region is very important for the treatment of the total cross - section and have built our bn model on the behaviour of @xmath1 in the infrared .",
    "to do so , we have made use of an anstz for such behaviour put forward long time ago to describe the intrinsic transverse momentum of drell - yan pairs @xcite .",
    "such anstz relates the rise with energy of the cross - section to the parameter regulating the emission of zero momentum gluons .",
    "the usual impact parameter representation of a purely absorptive cross - section is written as @xmath2 [ 1-e^{-n(b , s)/2 } ] , \\label{sigtot}\\ ] ] where the eikonal function @xmath3 is physically interpreted as the average number of collisions at a given impact parameter @xmath4 and squared c.m .",
    "energy @xmath5 .",
    "we distinguish between collisions calculable as qcd minijets , and everything else , writing the average number of collisions as @xmath6 with @xmath7 including all outgoing parton processes with @xmath8 . for its construction",
    "we use qcd minijets and a soft gluon distribution , which are described in the following two subsections along with a comparison with experimental data .      the mini - jet cross - section which drives the rise of the total cross - section",
    "is calculated in our model through the usual expression for inclusive jet production , namely @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the colliding hadrons or photons , in this case @xmath12 . by construction",
    ", this cross - section depends on the particular parametrization of the dglap @xcite evoluted parton densities , some of which do extend to very low x - values but not too high @xmath13 values .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "this cross - section strongly depends on the lowest @xmath14 value upon which one integrates .",
    "the term _ mini - jet _ was introduced long ago @xcite to indicate all those low @xmath14 processes for which one can still expect them to be qcd calculable but which are actually not observed as hard jets . @xmath14 being the scale at which to evaluate @xmath1 in the mini - jet cross - section calculation , one can have @xmath15 .      to describe the distribution in @xmath16space of the partons in the hadrons , which enter the eikonal representation",
    ", we use the fourier transform of the re - summed @xmath0 distribution of all soft gluons emitted in the parton - parton scattering , namely @xmath17 with @xmath18 , \\label{hdb}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ hdb ] ) , the upper limit of integration depends on the kinematics of the sub - process @xmath19 while the lower limit of intergration is taken to be zero with @xmath20 to relate this behaviour , inspired by the richardson potential for charmonium , to the usual asymptotic freedom expression for @xmath1 , we have used the phenomenological expression @xmath21   } } \\ ] ] it is clear that the closer @xmath22 is to 1 , the bigger the soft gluon integral @xmath23 is and the stronger the saturation effects will be .",
