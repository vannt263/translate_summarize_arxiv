    "interface problems arise in many simulations in science and engineering that involve multi - physics and multi - materials .",
    "classical numerical methods , such as finite element methods ( fem ) @xcite , and finite volume methods ( fvm ) @xcite usually require solution meshes to fit the interface ; otherwise , the convergence may be impaired .",
    "the immersed finite element methods ( ifem ) @xcite are a class of fem that relax the body - fitting requirement , hence cartesian meshes can be used for solving interface problems with arbitrary interface geometry .",
    "the key ingredient of ifem is to design some special basis functions on interface elements that can capture the non - smoothness of the exact solution .",
    "recently , this _ immersed _ idea has also been used in a variety of numerical schemes such as conforming fem @xcite , nonconforming fem @xcite , discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite , and fvm @xcite .",
    "the use of structured mesh , especially cartesian meshes , often leads to some superconvergence phenomenon .",
    "the superconvergence is a phenomenon that the order of convergence at certain points surpass the maximum order of convergence of the numerical schemes .",
    "there has been a growing interest in the study of superconvergence , for example , finite element methods @xcite , finite volume methods @xcite , discontinuous galerkin and local discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we first introduce a class of high order ifvm for one dimensional interface problems .",
    "thanks to the unified construction of fvm schemes in @xcite and the generalized orthogonal polynomials developed in @xcite , we can develop the high order ifvm in a systematical approach . to be more specific ,",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath2-th degree ife spaces @xcite as our trial function space . using the roots of generalized legendre polynomials , known as generalized gauss points , as the control volume",
    ", we construct the test function space as the piecewise constant corresponding to the dual meshes .",
    "the advantage of our ifvm is that it does not require the mesh to be aligned with the interface , and it inherits all the desired properties of the classical fvm such as local conservation of flux .",
    "the main focus of this article is the error analysis of ifvm , especially the superconvergence analysis . by establishing the inf - sup condition and continuity of the bilinear form",
    ", we prove that our ifvm converge optimally in @xmath0- norm . as for the superconvergence",
    ", we prove that the immersed finite volume ( ifv ) solution is superconvergent of the order @xmath3 at the generalized lobatto points on both non - interface and interface elements , and the flux error is superconvergent at the generalized gauss points of the order @xmath4 .",
    "the error of ifv solution and the gauss - lobatto projection is superclose . in particular , for the diffusion interface problem , we show that the convergence rate of both the solution error at nodes and the flux error at gauss points can be enhanced to @xmath5 .",
    "all these results are consistent with the superconvergence analysis of the standard fvm in @xcite .",
    "however , there is a significant difference in the superconvergence analysis of ifvm compared with the analysis of standard fvm @xcite . due to the low global regularity of the exact solution , the standard approach using the green function",
    "can not be directly applied to the ifvm for interface problems .",
    "the key ingredient in the analysis is the construction of generalized lobatto points and a specially designed interpolation function .",
    "that is , we first choose a class of generalized lobatto polynomials as our basis functions that satisfy both orthogonality and interface jump conditions , then we use these orthogonal basis function to design a special interpolant of the exact solution which is superclose to the ifv solution .",
    "the supercloseness of the interpolation and the ifv solution yields the desired superconvergence results for the ifv solution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the generalized orthogonal polynomials and present the high order ifvm for interface problems in one - dimensional setting . in section 3 we provide a unified analysis for the inf - sup condition and establish the optimal convergence in @xmath0 norm . in section 4 , we study the superconvergence property of ifvm .",
    "we identify and analyze superconvergence points for the ifv solution at both interface and non - interface elements .",
    "finally , some numerical examples are presented in section 5 .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we use the notation@xmath6 \" to denote @xmath7 can be bounded by @xmath8 multiplied by a constant independent of the mesh size .",
    "moreover ,  @xmath9 \" means @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we briefly review the generalized legendre and lobatto polynomials developed in @xcite .",
    "these generalized orthogonal polynomials will be used to form the trial function space in the ifvm .",

    "the basis functions of the trial function space is constructed using the ( generalized ) lobatto polynomials .",
    "in fact , we define the basis functions in each element @xmath56 as @xmath57 then corresponding trial function space is defined by @xmath58 obviously , @xmath59 .",
