    "the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) attributes the bright nucleus at the center of some galaxies to a super - massive black hole - accretion disk system surrounded by regions of broad line and narrow line gas clouds . within this unified model , the difference between radio - loud ( rl ) and radio - quiet ( rq ) agn",
    "is explained by rl agn possessing a relativistic jet emanating approximately perpendicular from the disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the early success of the unified agn model was its ability to explain the observational characteristics of the different rl agn sub - classes primarily by the size of the angle between the relativistic jet and the observer s line of sight .",
    "however , while the unified model works well to first order , there is growing evidence that it is an oversimplification ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and there are still several key fundamental questions that remain to be answered .",
    "one of these questions is why relativistic jets only appear to be present in 10 - 20% of agn .",
    "this question is often included in the broader issue of how accretion and ejecta are linked in agn ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to address this issue",
    ", the accretion disk - relativistic jet connection needs to be studied across a wide variety of rl agn types .",
    "broad line radio galaxies ( blrgs ) appear to be vital in such a study . with the line of sight orientated at an intermediate angle relative to the relativistic jet , blrgs exhibit",
    "both jet - related and disk - related photon emission processes .",
    "blrgs , therefore allow us to investigate how the processes of accretion ( disk ) and ejection ( jet ) relate to each other , and as such , represent a powerful diagnostic tool through which to understand this disk - jet connection - ray emission processes of radio galaxy jets are thought to be somewhat different to those of blazars , blrgs still allow us to investigate how the global jet emission is related to the accretion disk processes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the successful launch of the _ fermi _ @xmath0-ray space telescope affords us an ideal opportunity to investigate the accretion disk - jet connection in agn .",
    "the ability of the _ fermi_-lat detector to scan the entire @xmath0-ray sky every three hours allows us to search for @xmath0-ray emission from agn unbiased by activity state or agn sub - class .",
    "recently , the two year lat agn catalogue has been released ( 2lac ) , with the 2lac clean sample consisting of 885 sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "of these sources , the vast majority are of the blazar sub - class , however there is a growing number of other agn sub - classes , including radio galaxies and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies , detected as @xmath0-ray sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this increase in the number of different agn sub - classes detected as @xmath0-ray sources is extremely important for the phenomenological studies required to investigate the connection between accretion and ejection .    to date",
    ", two blrgs have been detected as @xmath0-ray sources , 3c 120 and 3c 111 ( @xcite ) . to investigate the connection between accretion and ejection in blrgs , @xcite were recently able to successfully model the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of both 3c 111 and 3c 120 with a combined model incorporating accretion disk emission , taken from @xcite , and relativistic jet emission , taken from @xcite .",
    "kataoka et al . also applied this combined disk - jet model to the two - year data set of a sample of 18 x - ray bright blrgs .",
    "while this study did not reveal any new @xmath0-ray emitting blrgs , it did find that five of the blrg sample have flux upper limits that were very close to the flux level predicted by the disk - jet model ( @xcite)-ray emission with a ts value of 20 from two years of observations . ] .",
    "motivated by the proximity of the upper limits to the model prediction , we utlised a larger three - year _ fermi _ data set to search for @xmath0-ray emission from the most promising blrg candidates . in total four blrgs sources were studied . while three of these did not show significant @xmath0-ray emission , our analysis revealed that pictor a is a high - energy @xmath0-ray source .",
    "pictor a ( z=0.035 , @xcite ; @xcite ) is an archetypical fanaroff - riley ii radio galaxy ( frii , @xcite ) , with the total radio emission dominated by the jet termination region observed as large radio lobes ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . from optical spectra ,",
    "pictor a is defined as a blrg ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly pictor a s host galaxy has recently been found to possess a disk - like morphology ( @xcite ) , indicating that pictor a is hosted by a spiral galaxy , and thus is one of the rare examples against the agn jet - ellipical host galaxy paradigm ( see @xcite for more details ) . due to its close proximity ,",
    "pictor a affords us an excellent opportunity to study not only the disk - jet connection but also the termination shock environment of the radio lobescdm cosmology and @xmath11 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ( @xcite ) , pictor a has a luminosity distance of about 148 mpc . at this distance 1",
    "arcsecond corresponds to approximately 700 parsecs . ] .",
    "it is not surprising then that pictor a has been extensively observed at many wavelengths .",
    "radio observations have found pictor a to possess mildly relativistic jets containing subluminal moving components ( @xcite ) .",
    "very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations have also shown complex radio structure within pictor a s radio lobes in the form of compact hot - spots ( @xcite ) .",
    "these remarkable hot - spots , along with the relativistic jet , have been studied with other observatories , including _",
    "_ hubble space telescope _ , _ xmm _ and _ chandra _ ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observations have found structured magnetic fields within both the relativistic jet and radio lobe hot - spots .",
    "synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) modelling of these broad - band observations predicts the possibility of @xmath0-ray emission through inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of the synchrotron photons on the relativistic electrons .",
    "however the predicted flux level is somewhat lower than the current @xmath0-ray upper limits from both the _ fermi _ and hess collaborations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while zhang et al . predicted @xmath0-ray emission originating from the conditions in the radio lobe hot - spots , the high - energy emission from blrgs is often attributed to the relativistic jet viewed at intermediate angles ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the question then arises as to whether the pictor a @xmath0-ray emission , that we have discovered , is associated with the radio lobe hot - spots or with the relativistic jet . to address this question",
    "we perform sed modelling of a prominent hot - spot in the western radio lobe of pictor a using archival data at other photon energies .",
    "we take two approaches . in our first approach",
    "we tune the various parameters available in the ssc model so as to best fit the sed of the radio to optical data and the @xmath0-ray data .",
    "we find that it is not possible to simultaneously fit these photon energy bands as well as the x - ray data with the x - ray flux over - predicted compared to observations .",
    "we then take the alternative approach of optimising the fit of the radio to optical data and the x - ray data .",
    "we find a good fit to this data but the predicted flux at @xmath0-ray energies is significantly below the flux that we have observed from pictor a. this suggests that if the @xmath0-ray emission is ssc in origin , it is not produced in the radio lobe hot - spot region where the other wavelength photons are observed to originate .",

    "however , it seems more likely that the reason why our sed modelling was unable to marry the whs observations with the observed @xmath0-ray flux is that the @xmath0-ray emission is of jet origin .",

    "magnetospheric emission models of agn core regions have been successful invoked to explain the @xmath0-ray emission from other radio galaxies such as m87 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
