    "recently , discovery of the new charm - strange state @xmath2 @xcite generated strong interest in charmed meson spectroscopy .",
    "the @xmath2 seems an obvious candidate for the @xmath7 @xmath8 state since it is the first observed charm - strange @xmath9 resonance .",
    "however , the observed mass of the @xmath2 is more than one hundred mev than the constituent quark model predictions for the @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the measured mass of the @xmath2 is @xmath10 mev@xcite , while the prediction of the @xmath7 @xmath8 state by isgur and godrey is 2.48 gev@xcite and that by di pierro and eichten is 2.487 gev@xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that the constituent quark model offers the most complete description of hadron properties and is probably the most successful phenomenological model of hadron structure@xcite .",
    "therefore , the substantially small observed mass of the @xmath2 led to many exotic interpretations on the underlying structure of the @xmath2 , such as the @xmath11 molecule , four - quark state , @xmath12 atom or baryonium have been proposed in the literature ( for the detailed review see _ e.g. _",
    "refs.@xcite ) .    it should be noted that it is very important to exhaust possible conventional @xmath8 descriptions of the @xmath2 before resorting to more exotic models , and the discrepancy between the measured mass of the @xmath2 and the quark model predictions for the @xmath7 @xmath8 mass maybe imply that approximations to the constituent quark model are not appropriate .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out by matsuki et al.@xcite that conventional quark models do not completely and consistently respect heavy quark symmetry and the @xmath2 mass can be reproduced if one treats a bound state equation appropriately .",
    "also , it is found by lee et al.@xcite that with the one loop chiral corrections , the quark model for @xmath8 mesons can naturally account for the unusually mass of the @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , it is shown that a simple modification to standard vector coulomb plus scalar linear quark potential model maintains good agreement with the charmonium spectrum and agrees remarkably well with the @xmath13 and @xmath14 spectra@xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we shall show in regge phenomenology , masses of the recent observed charmed states @xmath15 , @xmath2 , @xmath3@xcite and @xmath16@xcite can be reproduced within a simple @xmath17 picture , and our estimated masses are in good agreement with those predicted by@xcite .",
    "therefore , our analysis supports the conclusion that it is not necessary to introduce more exotic models for understanding masses of these reported charmed states .",
    "regge theory is concerned with the particle spectrum , the forces between particles , and the high energy behavior of scattering amplitudes@xcite .",
    "one of the most distinctive features of regge theory is the regge trajectory by which the mass and the spin of a hadron are related .",
    "knowledge of the regge trajectories is useful not only for spectral purpose , but also for many non - spectral purpose .",
    "the intercepts and slopes of the regge trajectories are of fundamental importance in hadron physics@xcite .",
    "a series of recent papers by anisovich et al.@xcite show that meson states fit to the quasi - linear regge trajectories with sufficiently good accuracy , although some suggestions that the realistic regge trajectories could be nonlinear exist@xcite .",
    "the quasi - linear regge trajectories for a meson multiplet can be parameterized as @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) refers to the quark ( antiquark ) flavor , @xmath21 denotes the meson @xmath22 with radial quantum number @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively the spin and mass of the @xmath21 meson , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the intercept and slope of the trajectory on which the @xmath21 meson lies . for a meson multiplet",
    ", the parameters for different flavors can be related by the following relations ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) :    \\(i ) additivity of intercepts , @xmath30    \\(ii ) additivity of inverse slopes , @xmath31 from ( [ trajectory ] ) and ( [ intercept ] ) , we obtain that @xmath32    the main purpose of this work is to discuss whether masses of the recent observed charmed states such as the @xmath15 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath16 can be reproduced correctly in the conventional quark - antiquark picture based on regge phenomenology . because the possible quantum numbers of the @xmath3 include @xmath9 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35@xcite , @xmath36 of the @xmath5 ( @xmath4 ) is @xmath33@xcite system , babar observed a resonance ( @xmath4 ) with a mass @xmath37 mev and width @xmath38 mev@xcite , belle subsequently observed a resonance ( @xmath39 ) with a mass @xmath40 mev , width @xmath41 mev and @xmath42@xcite , we regard them compatible , and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 should be the same one resonance with @xmath43 . ] , and the @xmath9 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 trajectories are parity partners@xcite , in the following text , we shall adopt two assumptions : ( a ) the slopes of the parity partners trajectories coincide , as proposed by ref.@xcite , and ( b ) @xmath44 , as adopted by ref.@xcite . under these two assumptions ,",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the @xmath1-like trajectories . in this work ,",
    "the slopes of the @xmath1-like trajectories used as input are taken from our previous work@xcite and these slopes are shown in table 1 . in the following , @xmath45 denotes a @xmath46 or @xmath47 quark .",
    ".slopes of the @xmath1-like trajectories taken from ref.@xcite , all in gev@xmath48 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "from table 3 and figures 2 - 3 , it is clear that the agreement between our predicted @xmath13 and @xmath49 masses and the recent predictions by some modified quark model@xcite is quite good .",
    "it therefore appears likely that regge phenomenology is capable of describing the @xmath13 and @xmath49 masses with reasonable accuracy .",
    "our predicted @xmath50 meson mass is 2.268 gev , in good agreement with the preliminary belle measurement of @xmath51 mev@xcite and the current belle mass of @xmath52 mev@xcite within one to two percent of accuracy , while in disagreement with the focus mass of @xmath53 mev@xcite . for the @xmath54 mass ,",
    "our prediction is 2.331 gev , only 13.7 mev higher than the experimental result , and in good agreement with the recent result predicted by qcd sum rule that @xmath55 gev@xcite .",
    "our analysis supports the conclusion that the @xmath2 can be identified as a conventional @xmath7 @xmath8 state .",
    "based on the measured masses of @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 states for the @xmath1 and @xmath59 multiplets , the predicted masses for the @xmath1 and @xmath59 @xmath17 by relation ( [ mass-1 ] ) are in excellent agreement with the measurements . in the presence of @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 gev , the relation ( [ mass-1 ] )",
    "gives an accurate determination for the @xmath50 and @xmath54 masses , it implies that the @xmath62 could be indeed the lightest non - singlet scalar meson .",
    "babar recently reported the discovery of a new @xmath3 state with a mass of @xmath63 mev and width of @xmath64 mev@xcite .",
    "babar observed this state only in the @xmath65 or @xmath66 system and found no evidence in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels , therefore the possible @xmath69 of the @xmath3 is @xmath70 .    based on our prediction as shown in table 3 ,",
    "the @xmath3 mass is about 213 mev higher than the @xmath71 @xmath8 mass ( 2653 mev ) , and 82 mev higher than the @xmath72 @xmath8 mass ( 2775 mev ) .",
    "the decay pattern and total width of the @xmath3 for various quantum number assignments has been investigated by zhang et al.@xcite in a @xmath73 decay model .",
    "if the @xmath3 is the @xmath71 @xmath8 state , its total width is about 90 mev , and the dominant decay modes are @xmath74 with @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 with @xmath77 mev , and the @xmath78 mode is only 12 kev@xcite . if the @xmath3 is the @xmath72 @xmath8 state , its total width is about 132 mev , and @xmath79@xcite",
    ". both the predicted mass and width for the @xmath71 or @xmath72 @xmath8 are significantly larger than the experimental data of the @xmath3 , making the assignment of the @xmath3 as the @xmath71 or @xmath72 @xmath8 unfavorable .",
    "however , the @xmath3 mass is close to our predicted @xmath80 mass ( 2839 mev ) and @xmath81 mass ( 2815 mev ) .",
    "if the @xmath3 is the @xmath82 @xmath8 state , its total width becomes around 54 mev , consistent with the measured width of the @xmath3 , @xmath64 mev , within errors , the dominant decay modes are @xmath78 with @xmath83 mev and @xmath84 with @xmath85 mev@xcite , and the decay modes @xmath76 , @xmath86 and @xmath74 are forbidden . the suggestion that the @xmath3 can be identified as",
    "the @xmath82 @xmath8 has been given by @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath3 is the @xmath87 @xmath8 state , its total width is about 37 mev , also compatible with @xmath64 mev within errors , the dominant decay modes are @xmath78 with @xmath88 mev and @xmath76 with @xmath89 mev@xcite .",
    "the assignment of the @xmath3 as the @xmath35 @xmath8 has been proposed by @xcite . at present ,",
    "only the decay @xmath90 is observed experimentally , which is not enough to distinguish the above two possible assignments , therefore , the assignment of the @xmath3 as the @xmath82 or @xmath87 @xmath8 seems favorable by the available experimental information .    it should be noted that for the @xmath82 @xmath8 state , the decay modes @xmath76 , @xmath86 and @xmath74 are forbidden , and the @xmath87 @xmath8 state has a large @xmath91 decay width and a small @xmath84 decay width ( @xmath92 mev@xcite ) , therefore , the further experimental search of the @xmath3 in the @xmath74 , @xmath76 , @xmath86 and @xmath84 decay modes would be certainly desirable for distinguish the above two possible assignments .",
    "our predicted mass of the @xmath71 @xmath8 state is around 2653 mev , in excellent agreement with the prediction @xmath93 mev obtained by chang from bethe - salpeter equation@xcite , and 48  mev lighter than the @xmath16 mass .",
    "if the @xmath16 is the @xmath71 @xmath8 state , its total width is about 103 mev in a @xmath73 decay model@xcite , consistent with the measured width of @xmath38 or @xmath41 mev , and the dominant decay modes are @xmath78 with a width of 22 mev and @xmath76 with a width of 78 mev@xcite .",
    "also , the @xmath16 mass is about 74 mev lighter than our predicted @xmath94 mass ( 2775 mev ) , if it is the @xmath94 state , the calculations performed by ref.@xcite within a @xmath73 model show its total width is 73 mev , also roughly consistent with the experimental data , and the dominant decay modes are @xmath78 with a width of about 49 mev and @xmath84 with a width of about 13 mev .",
    "therefore , the @xmath16 as either a @xmath71 or @xmath72 @xmath8 seems consistent with experimental data@xcite .",
    "considering that the @xmath16 mass is about 48 mev higher than @xmath95 , while 74 mev lower than @xmath96 , we tend to suggest the @xmath16 is most likely a mixture of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it has been found that@xcite in the presence of the @xmath71 @xmath8 mixing with @xmath72 @xmath8 ( with the mixing angle of approximately @xmath99 radians ) , the predicted total width of the @xmath16 ( with mass set to 2688 mev ) by a @xmath73 model becomes about 110 mev , in good agreement with the data .",
    "masses of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states lying on the @xmath1-like trajectories are estimated in regge phenomenology .",
    "the predicted masses agree well with the recent results by some modified quark models .",
    "it therefore appears likely that regge phenomenology is capable of describing the @xmath13 and @xmath49 masses with reasonable accuracy .",
    "our predictions show that masses of the recent observed charmed states such as the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath16 can be reasonably reproduced in the simple quark - antiquark picture . based on our analysis",
    ", we suggest the @xmath100 can be identified as the conventional @xmath7 @xmath8 state , the assignment of the @xmath3 as the @xmath101 or @xmath102 seems favorable , and the @xmath16 is most likely a mixture of the @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
