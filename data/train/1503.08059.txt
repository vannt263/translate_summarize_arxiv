    "it is well - known that fourth derivative terms are necessary in the gravitational action , to render the theory consistent at the semiclassical level ( see @xcite for an introduction to the subject and also @xcite for a recent pedagogical review ) . in quantum gravity ( qg )",
    "the same fourth derivative terms provide renormalizability of the theory @xcite . at the same time , adding fourth derivative terms to the standard einstein - hilbert action has an undesirable effect , since the spectrum of the theory in the spin-2 sector gains a massive unphysical ghost in addition to the usual healthy graviton .",
    "an attempt to remove these unphysical states from the initial quantum state leads to a non - unitary quantum theory . in the semiclassical theory ,",
    "when gravity is a classical background for quantum matter fields , there is no problem with the unitarity of the gravitational @xmath0-matrix , hence the condition of consistency can be reduced to the requirement of stability of the physically relevant classical solutions with respect to small metric perturbations . in the present work",
    "we will discuss a new aspect of this problem , related to the difference between the massive unphysical ghost and the tachyon .",
    "let us start by fixing the notations .",
    "the action of gravity corresponding to the renormalizable semiclassical theory ( for introduction one can see , e.g. , @xcite , further references therein and also recent more formal work @xcite ) consists of the following terms : s_vac = s_eh+s_hd , [ vac ] where @xmath1 is the einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant term , s_eh & = & - d^4x \\{r + 2 } [ s_eh ] and @xmath2 includes a minimal necessary set of higher derivative terms , s_hd = d^4x \\{a_1 c^2 + a_2 e_4 + a_3 r + a_4 r^2}. [ s_hd ] in this expression e_4 = r_^2 - 4 r_^2 + r^2 [ e ] is the gauss - bonnet term ( euler density in @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 is the square of the weyl tensor .",
    "furthermore , we use units corresponding to @xmath5 and denote with @xmath6 the planck mass .",
    "the metric has signature @xmath7 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that the absolute value of @xmath8 is of order one .",
    "a general observation about the form of the action and especially higher derivative terms ( [ s_hd ] ) is in order .",
    "one can deal with these terms in two different ( albeit physically equivalent ) ways .",
    "first , it is possible to consider the classical action of gravity being free of higher derivative terms . then one can observe that ( different from the flat - space qed , for instance ) there are higher derivative divergences , corresponding to the running of these terms and hence the non - local structures such as we shall discuss later on in eq .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) .",
    "this means that even if the terms ( [ s_hd ] ) are not introduced at the classical level , the corresponding quantum contributions emerge anyway .",
    "second , one can follow the standard qft approach and introduce into the classical action all those terms which will emerge with divergent coefficients in the loop corrections .",
    "the main advantage of this procedure is technical simplicity , because one can always deal with a usual renormalization procedure , consider the renormalization group running in a useful conventional way @xcite etc .",
    "the last observation is that the list of the terms in ( [ s_eh ] ) and ( [ s_hd ] ) follows from the fact that only these structures emerge in the semiclassical approach at all loop orders .",
    "this fact is known starting from the classical work of utiyama and dewitt @xcite , and can be easily seen from the covariant renormalizability and power counting for the semiclassical theory @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the theory ( [ vac ] ) linearized around a minkowski background contains in the spin-2 sector the massless graviton and an additional spin-2 particle with mass of order @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath8 is negative this particle has positive mass square , negative kinetic energy and hence is a ghost . for a positive @xmath8",
    "the mass square is negative and the particle is a ghost and a tachyon at the same time @xcite .",
    "we postpone the detailed description of these two types of particles to the next section and now only make some general observations .    according to the recent discussion in @xcite , at least on a cosmological frw background massive ghost excitations are not generated far below the planck threshold of frequencies .",
    "the same result was found much earlier @xcite for desitter background .",
    "qualitatively similar considerations can be found in @xcite for generic models of massive gravity , where one can also meet massive ghosts or tachyons .",
    "the result of @xcite means that a massive unphysical ghost can be destructive for the theory , but only if it appears as a real physical particle . on the other side",
    ", the presence of a ghost in the mass spectrum of the theory may not affect stability if such a ghost is just a virtual particle in the vacuum state of the theory .",
    "one can note that the problem of massive ghost is a tree - level problem of quantum theory .",
    "it is equivalent to the absence of stability in the classical theory . in practical terms",
    "the conclusion of @xcite means that one can choose the initial condition in such a way that the system does not develop instability for sufficiently long time .",
    "according to @xcite this choice of initial conditions is possible for @xmath10 .    on the contrary ,",
    "for the case @xmath11 the extra massive particle is a ghost and tachyon at the same time and satisfies an anti - oscillator equation with exponential solutions .",
    "then instabilities are unavoidable , even without the presence of an external force .",
    "moreover , the intensity of the instability may be even enhanced if the mass of the tachyon increases .",
    "there is no possible choice of initial conditions which can help to control the instabilities in this case .",
    "one can naturally ask whether we can define @xmath8 to be zero and thus avoid to have both ghost and tachyon states in the spectrum .",
    "the answer to this question is negative , because at the quantum level the parameter @xmath8 runs due to the change of the energy scale . in this work",
    "we will assume that gravity is classical and we take into account only quantum effects of matter fields .",
    "in the last section we will also comment on the possible role of quantum gravity within some of the existing approaches .",
    "let us stress that the running of @xmath8 is a pretty well - explored theoretical phenomenon . in particular , the full expressions for the `` physical '' @xmath12-functions in the momentum subtraction scheme of renormalization were calculated in @xcite and @xcite . at low energies one can observe quantum decoupling , which is a close analogous of the appelquist and carazzone theorem in qed @xcite .",
    "this means that in the present - day universe , when the typical energy scale of the background is of the order of @xmath13 , all massive fields are too massive to affect the running of @xmath8 in the ir .",
    "hence , in the late universe it is sufficient to take into account quantum effects produced by the unique massless particle , which is the photon .",
    "starting from sect .",
    "iii it will be done in the framework of anomaly - induced effective action , which is the most appropriate formalism for classically conformal fields .",
    "it is well - known that the renormalization group in gravity meets a hard problem in identifying the energy scale @xmath14 with some physical quantity related to gravity ( see , e.g. , the discussion of this issue in @xcite and also the scale - setting procedure suggested in @xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", all these difficulties concern only quantum effects of massive fields , while the case of photon is different .",
    "the point is that electromagnetic fields are massless and possess local conformal invariance .",
    "thanks to this symmetry one can integrate the conformal anomaly @xcite and arrive at the reliable form of the semiclassical corrections to the classical action .",
    "the anomaly - induced effective action @xcite can be regarded as a local version of renormalization group @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to use the anomaly - induced action to explore the running of @xmath8 in the far ir due to loop effects of virtual photons on a cosmological background .",
    "this running predicts that at some point in the distant future the parameter @xmath8 changes sign and becomes positive . at this instant",
    "the tachyonic mode with mass parameter unbounded from above @xmath15 will manifest an explosive growth of gravitational waves within the full range of frequencies starting from zero to the planck scale .",
    "this means that in a very short time interval metric perturbations break down the linear regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ s2 ] mainly serves pedagogical purposes and describes the classification of ghosts and tachyons in free theories with actions of both second- and fourth - order in derivatives .",
    "we also discuss of the difference between ghosts and tachyons in the effective field theory approach . in sect .",
    "[ s3 ] we summarize the main results concerning the anomaly - induced effective action of gravity and explore the effective equations of motion on cosmological backgrounds for radiation- , matter- and cosmological constant - dominated solutions .",
    "[ s4 ] includes the final results for the physical running of @xmath8 in the same three cases . in sect .",
    "[ s5 ] we specialize our study to the late desitter phase of the evolution of the universe and estimate the time period of time for the universe to accelerate until the instant when @xmath8 changes sign from negative to positive . finally , in sect .",
    "[ s6 ] we critically discuss the list of assumptions which have been introduced in our analysis and draw our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the classification of free fields into normal `` healthy '' ones , ghosts and tachyons . for our purpose",
    "it is sufficient to consider flat space - time .      for the second - order theory",
    "the general action of a free field @xmath16 is s(h ) & = & d^4x \\",
    "{ ^_h _ h - s_2 m^2 h^2 } + & = & d^4x \\ { h^2 - ( h)^2 - s_2 m^2 h^2 } .",
    "[ act ] both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are sign factors which take values @xmath19 for different types of fields . in what follows",
    "we consider all four combinations of these signs .",
    "it proves useful to perform the fourier transform in the space variables , h(t , r ) = d^3k e^ikh(t , k ) , [ fur ] and consider the dynamics of each component @xmath20 separately .",
    "it is easy to see that this dynamics is defined by the action s_k(h ) & = & dt \\ { h^2 - k^2 h - s_2 m^2 h^2 } + & = & dt \\ { h^2 - m_k^2 h^2 } , [ act * ] where ^2 = k , m_k^2 = s_2 m^2 + k^2 .",
    "[ kmass ] the properties of the field are defined by the sign of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the possible options can be classified as follows .    _",
    "_ normal healthy field",
    "_  corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "the kinetic energy of the field is positive and the minimal action can be achieved for a static configuration . also , the equation of motion is of the oscillatory type , + m_k^2 h = 0 , [ pp ] with the usual periodic solution .    _",
    "( ii ) _  _ tachyon _  has @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the classical dynamics of tachyons is described in the literature , e.g. , @xcite , hence we present just a very brief review .",

    "( [ kmass ] ) and the equation of motion is - ^2 h = 0 , ^2 = |m_k^2| . [ pm ] then we have an anti - oscillatory equation with exponential solutions , h = h_1 e^t+h_2 e^-t , ^2 = |m_k^2| .",
    "[ om ] if the particle moves faster than light the solution is of the oscillatory kind , indicating that such a motion is `` natural '' for this kind of particle @xcite .",
    "an additional observation concerning tachyons is in order . for a field interacting with an external gravitational background , it is not impossible to have a situation where the same wave changes from being a normal healthy state to a tachyonic one in different parts of the space - time manifold . in principle",
    ", this situation may produce very strong effects at both quantum @xcite and classical @xcite levels . in the present paper we are considering a",
    "qualitatively similar situation , where the massive component of the gravitational wave changes its fundamental properties due to the change of the energy scale or due to the time evolution in desitter vacuum .    _",
    "( iii ) _  _ massive ghost _ has @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "it is not a tachyon , because @xmath27 . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy of the field is negative , but one can postulate zero variation of the action and arrive at the normal oscillatory equation ( [ pp ] ) .",
    "a particle with negative kinetic energy has the tendency to achieve a maximal speed , but a free particle can not accelerate , for this would violate energy conservation .",
    "hence a free ghost does not produce any harm to the environment , being isolated from it .",
    "however , if we admit an interaction with healthy fields , the tendency of a ghost is to accelerate and transmit positive energy difference to these healthy fields @xcite , e.g. , in the form of quantum emission of the corresponding particles .",
    "there are many detailed discussions of the fundamental problems at both classical and quantum levels which arise in the theories with ghosts ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . in general , the problem of ghosts and the consequent conflict between renormalizability and unitarity is one of the most important for quantum gravity , and hence attracted a lot of attention",
    ". the list of references on the possible approaches to avoid the problem of higher derivative ghosts can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we also suggested a new approach to dealing with ghosts , which is based on the effective field theory ideas , but is technically classical and very simple .",
    "there are strong indications that the creation of ghost states from vacuum is strongly suppressed for a relatively weak cosmological background of the late universe .",
    "the consideration presented below is based on the same idea , and assumes the same approach .    _",
    "( iv ) _  _ tachyonic ghost _ has @xmath28 . for relatively small @xmath29 we have @xmath24 .",
    "the kinetic energy is negative and the derivation of the equations of motion requires an additional definition similar to the non - tachyonic ghost case . after that , one can notice that the equation of motion is of the anti - oscillatory type , eq .",
    "( [ pm ] ) and the solutions are exponential ( [ om ] ) .      in the fourth - order gravity ( [ vac ] ) the equations for the metric perturbations in flat space can be easily obtained from the more general ones on cosmological backgrounds @xcite ( see also eq .",

    "indeed , the first couple of roots corresponds to the massless graviton , and the second couple to an extra massive particle . according to our classification ,",
    "this particle is a ghost for @xmath35 and , simultaneously , ghost and tachyon for @xmath36 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the main difference between ghosts and tachyons is that a ghost may cause instabilities only when it couples to some healthy fields or to the background , while with tachyons there is no such a protection .",
    "the situation with ghosts can be kept under control in the effective field theory framework , as it was recently discussed in @xcite . in an effective field theory",
    "there may be an apparent ghost due to the low - energy expansion in the powers of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the energy and @xmath39 is cut - off . at the same time , there could be no ghost in the underlying fundamental quantum theory .",
    "in this situation one can safely use an effective description for energies @xmath40 and do not pay much attention to the presence of ghosts .",
    "the situation in gravity is similar , but with an important difference that the ghost - free uv completion of the renormalizable theory is not known .",
    "let us note that string theory can not be regarded as such an uv completion , since the @xmath41-like terms which are the source of ghosts are removed in string theory by a special transformation of the background metric @xcite and not by a low - energy expansion . on the other side ,",
    "there are strong indications that the gravitational theory with massive ghosts can be free of instabilities at low energies , since for @xmath42 the ghost may be a virtual particle and effectively it is not created from vacuum @xcite ( including erratum of this paper ) .",
    "the reason is that a weak gravitational background is not providing sufficient density of energy to generate ghost as a real particle excitation . only for the typical frequencies of the planck order of magnitude ghost",
    "becomes destructive , while at much lower energies one does not need to worry about its presence in the spectrum . by the end of the day",
    "the situation is very close to the one in effective field theories @xcite .    on the contrary",
    ", no low - energy protection can be expected in the theory with tachyons , because they produce instabilities independently on their interaction to normal particles or on the intensity of the background .",
    "in other words , for tachyons the exponential behavior ( [ om ] ) occurs at all frequencies , and not only above the planck threshold @xcite .",
    "therefore , the difference between ghosts and tachyons is expected to be critical for the low - energy regimes .",
    "in what follows we will use the formalism of anomaly - induced effective action of vacuum , so let us start by describing an application of this approach to the late - epoch cosmology .    for a general theory including @xmath43 massless conformal scalars , @xmath44 massless dirac fermions and @xmath45 massless vectors ,",
    "the anomalous trace of the energy - momentum tensor is @xcite t^_&= & - ( _ 1c^2 + _ 2e_4 + _",

    "[ ombc ] it was already mentioned in the introduction that in the late universe the loops of all massive fields decouple from gravity .",
    "the reason is that the typical energy scale of the universe is usually defined by the hubble parameter , which has the present - day order of magnitude @xmath46 .",
    "this is a very small value if compared even to the lightest known particles , e.g. , the standard estimate for neutrino is @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , according to the existing results on the gravitational decoupling @xcite in the present - day ( and certainly later ) universe one need to take into account only the contribution of photons , which are massless . hence one has to set @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the expressions for the @xmath12-functions ( [ ombc ] ) .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , where the discussion of the role of conformal functional @xmath54 $ ] can be also found .",

    "the dependence on the conformal factor in the weyl - squared term is exactly the same as the one in the well - known logarithmic form factor for the massless quantum fields _ ws & = & - c _ ( ) c^ , [ w2 ] where @xmath55 means @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the photon .",
    "one has to remember that the term ( [ w2 ] ) comes from quantum corrections ( loop of photon , in our case , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the illustration ) independently on whether the higher derivative term ( [ s_hd ] ) is included or not into the classical vacuum action . including this term is useful to make the procedure of renormalization more simple and regular .",

    "therefore , the proper fact of our existence puts strong restrictions on the values of @xmath81 and @xmath84 until the present time .",
    "according to the recent observations @xcite our universe is now entering into a phase of its evolution dominated by the cosmological constant .",
    "the analysis of the time - dependent parameter @xmath85 during the last phase of the evolution of the @xmath62cdm universe deserves a special consideration and will be explored in this section .",

    "the theory propagates a massless graviton @xmath90 , satisfying ( + ) h_^(m)=0 and a massive spin-2 field @xmath91 , satisfying ( + + m^2_2 ) h_^(m)=0 .",
    "since we are interested only in the tensor part of the perturbation @xmath92 , let us consider [ m ] h _ & = & h_^tens = (    cc 0 & 0 + 0 & h^tt_ija^2    ) , where we used tt - gauge @xmath93 , @xmath94 and set @xmath95 , with @xmath96 .    for the analysis of tensor perturbations it is more practical to use physical time @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , after we separate the @xmath98-mode , there is no need to write indices and the field variable can be simply denoted as @xmath99",
    ". then the eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) can be written as [ main ] & & + 6 h + ( 11 h^2 + m_2 ^ 2 + ) + & & + ( 6 h^3 + 3 hm_2 ^ 2 + ) + ( + ) h = 0 , where we have used the background constraint @xmath100 and where dots indicate time derivatives . for @xmath58 , eq . ( [ main ] ) reduces to the usual equation for general relativity ( gr ) tensor perturbations around desitter background .",
    "the numerical investigation of eq . ( [ main ] ) for both signs of @xmath8 has been performed in @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned , for frequencies @xmath101 the case of @xmath10 shows oscillating solutions without growing amplitudes .",
    "this behavior for three different frequencies is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . on the contrary , for @xmath11",
    "one can observe a rapid growth of the metric perturbations for all frequencies , see fig [ fig2 ] which are too much close to zero , since the growth of tensor perturbations is too fast in this case . ]",
    "we want now to quantify which is the typical time scale at which anomaly - induced corrections to the classical coefficient of the weyl square term , @xmath8 , come into play . in pure desitter , we found that the behavior of @xmath83 is described by eq .",
    "( [ ds a1 ] ) , we focus our analysis on time - scales of order @xmath102 , since this is the expected scale of the instabilities . on this scales , the decaying exponentials in ( [ ds a1 ] )",
    "vary slowly and can be treated as constant functions .",
    "hence , we can parametrize eq .",
    "( [ ds a1 ] ) as a_1^eff(t ) & = & _ 1 + h(t - t_ds ) , [ a1eff fin ] where @xmath103 is the time at which the density of matter and radiation become effectively negligible and a pure desitter phase starts .",
    "since we are not assisting an overproduction of gravitational waves at present time , the nowadays value of @xmath83 has to be negative ( i.e. , we are in the regime in which tensor perturbations are stable ) .",
    "as soon as @xmath85 crosses zero going to positive values , the gravitational waves enter the unstable phase ( the massive ghost becomes tachyonic ) .",
    "then an exponential instability in the tensor sector instantaneously shows - up .    one can ask whether the stable phase , characterized by a negative @xmath104 will last for a long period of time .",
    "we can assume that the stable phase in which we are living today will last at least until the beginning of the `` pure '' desitter phase of the expansion of our universe , hence we take @xmath105 to be negative and of order one . in the @xmath62cdm model , with @xmath106 , the value of the hubble parameter in the pure desitter phase is h_&= & 0.8 h_0 1.210 ^ -42 gev . replacing @xmath107 into ( [ a1eff fin ] ) we find the time @xmath108 at which tachyonic modes emerge in the spectrum of gravitational waves , t_q = 2.410 ^ 13yr= 2.410 ^ 4bi .",
    "[ tq ] hence with the assumption @xmath109 the remaining time until the gravitational wave explosion is about thousand time longer than the time which already passed from the big bang .",
    "of course , since we have no experimental data to define the present - day value of @xmath110 , the estimate given above has an ambiguity . according to eq .",
    "( [ tq ] ) larger values of @xmath110 correspond to a longer stable phase , while smaller values of @xmath110 imply a shorter period of stability before the tachyonic explosion .",
    "regardless of the quantitative side of this prediction , it looks interesting that our knowledge of quantum corrections to gravity is sufficient to know how the @xmath62cdm universe will end up . according to our analysis",
    ", there will be an instant gravitational waves explosion due to the tachyonic instabilities .",
    "we have started from a minimal set of hypotheses and arrived at the conclusion that the final destiny of the @xmath62cdm universe is not a peaceful infinitely long slightly accelerated expansion in the homogeneous and isotropic phase . on the contrary",
    ", the universe will end up in a strong tachyonic explosion of tensor perturbations . at first sight",
    "the intensity of this explosion ( at least in the first order approximation ) looks unrestricted , since at the instant when @xmath83 changes sign , the mass of the unstable mode is infinite , according to eq .",
    "( [ om ] ) . then gravitational waves of all frequencies will experience a fast exponential growth .",
    "however , since one can not trust the semiclassical approximation completely , the conservative estimate is that the tachyonic modes will have , at most , energy density of the planck order of magnitude .",
    "certainly , this is more than sufficient to provide a dramatic effect on the geometry and matter contents of the universe .",
    "another natural restriction comes from the fact that the instability which we have found corresponds to linear perturbations .",
    "it might happen that next orders in the perturbative expansion in @xmath92 will restore the stability .",
    "however , from the practical side both these restrictions do not matter too much , because even this `` restricted '' gravitational explosion should be capable to destroy the symmetry ( homogeneity and isotropy ) of the metric , and thus lead to the strong changes of the properties of space - time .",
    "since the result of our study looks so dramatic , it is interesting to consider the list of all the approximations which have been introduced in our analysis",
    ". let us formulate various possibilities to avoid the instabilities in a the form of questions and answers .",
    "can we expect some qualitative changes in the result by taking higher - order loops into account ?",
    "formally , higher - loop contributions do not change the sign of the @xmath111-function @xcite , but this is not sufficient to draw the conclusion about the relevance of higher - loop terms . in the uv regime",
    "there will be higher logarithmic contributions compared to the one - loop form factor ( [ w2 ] ) and this could produce strong effect on the running of @xmath8 .",
    "however , the situation at low energies is quite different .",
    "let us remember that second- and higher - loop corrections to the one - photon bubble include a loop of electrons or of other massive charged fermions , as shown in fig .",
    "because of the appelquist and carazzone decoupling theorem in qed , the contribution of such a loop is suppressed at least by a factor @xmath112 for the dynamics of the conformal factor . since this is the part which governs the running of @xmath83 , there are no chances that higher loops can change the result found for the conformal factor dynamics .    , with the electron loop insertion .",
    "the diagram at the left is subject to decoupling in the ir.,width=302,height=75 ]    at the same time , we have to remember that the goal of our study is not the dynamics of the conformal factor itself , but its interaction to gravitational waves .",
    "indeed , the term in the effective action which we implicitly deal with is ( [ w2 ] ) . at the two - loop order there will be non - local corrections to the photon propagator and photon - graviton vertex .",
    "since we do not quantize gravity , the last type of diagrams can be ruled out .",
    "the simplest diagram at higher loops will be the one from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with the polarization operator insertion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , due to the electron loop .    concerning this and further diagrams it is easy to see that the mass which defines the scale of decoupling will be the mass of the quantum fermion , while the typical energy of the external particle will be the one of the gravitational wave . finally , the relevant ratio which defines the effective cut - off for the higher - loop contributions to the running of @xmath8 is @xmath113 for a tensor mode with energy @xmath114",
    ". of course this energy can be much bigger than @xmath115 .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath116 we have `` only '' ten - orders decoupling . indeed",
    ", the gravitational wave production with corresponding energy density will have a very strong physical and geometrical effect .",
    "it is worth noting that we are dealing with the diagrams which consist of the loops of matter fields and external lines of gravity .",
    "therefore , the one - loop part is given by the contributions of free fields on a gravitational background .",
    "for this reason there is no dependence on the coupling constants at one loop order , and such dependence can be observed only starting from the second loop @xcite . finally , the one - loop effects of photons are _ not _ suppressed by mass , since photon is massless . however , all particles to which photon is coupled , are massive ( and their masses are huge compared to the gravitational waves energy ) and that is why the two - loop effects are indeed strongly suppressed .",
    "the consideration presented above shows that the one - loop results ( [ rad a1 ] ) , ( [ mat a1 ] ) and ( [ ds a1 ] ) are sufficiently robust in the framework of the semiclassical theory , at least for gravitational waves with frequency smaller than the electron mass .",
    "the case of waves with higher frequencies deserves an additional investigation , but it can not change the qualitative result which we obtained at the one - loop level .      what about quantum gravity ( qg ) effects , which have been neglected so far ? it is not easy to give a definite answer due to the variety of existing models of qg .",
    "let us consider a short list of the possibilities which have been better explored up to now .",
    "the standard effective framework for the ir effects of qg assumes that general relativity ( gr ) is a universal theory of ir quantum gravity @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier work in this direction and @xcite for an alternative opinion ) .",
    "the first thing to note is that gr is not a conformal theory , therefore a compact representation of quantum corrections in the form ( [ finaction ] ) is not possible . in this situation",
    "one can make use of the renormalization group and of the perturbative @xmath12-function @xmath111 for the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath111-function gives , in the case of massless theory ( e.g. , quantum gr ) , the coefficient in the logarithmic form factor ( [ w2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it can be still considered a good approximation in the present case . in this fremework the change of sign of the renormalization group equation ( [ a1eff fin ] ) looks unclear , at least beyond the one - loop level .",
    "the reason is that higher - loop contributions of qg are beyond our control , because qg based on gr is non - renormalizable .",
    "still we can draw some conclusions about the effective quantum gravity .",
    "at the one - loop level , the weyl - squared quantum counterterm is known to be gauge - fixing dependent @xcite",
    ". then one can provide any desirable value of @xmath111 by a special choice of the gauge - fixing parameters .",
    "this also means that the corresponding contribution vanishes on - shell and therefore can not be regarded as a physical effect .",
    "furthermore , similar gauge - fixing dependence is expected for the leading logarithmic corrections at higher loops .",
    "therefore , while the subject is not completely clear , one can suppose that the leading contributions of qg in this framework will be sub - logarithmic .",
    "as we have already seen in subsection [ sub1 ] , this means that the change of sign of @xmath111 in ( [ ombc ] ) due to effective low - energy qg is very unlikely .      in this case",
    "the form ( [ finaction ] ) of quantum corrections is available and the effect of qg is to increase the positive value of @xmath111 .",
    "the reason is that the contribution of conformal qg is positive @xcite , exactly as the one of all matter fields ( [ ombc ] ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath45 copies of massless vector fields has the form _ 1 & = & ( + ) , [ extend - w ] where the last term is the qg contribution .",
    "it is easy to see that no cancellation is possible , and for @xmath49 the qg contribution shortens the period of time until the sign transition for @xmath83 of about one order of magnitude .      in this case , exactly like in the effective qg described in subsection [ sub3 ] , the form of quantum corrections of the type ( [ finaction ] ) , is not viable , because the original theory is not conformal , hence there is no anomaly to integrate . at the same time",
    "the @xmath12-function for the parameter @xmath8 is well - defined , free of ambiguities @xcite and , according to well - verified calculations @xcite has the same positive sign as ( [ ombc ] ) .",
    "the overall @xmath111-function for @xmath45 copies of massless vector fields has the form _ 1 & = & ( + ) .",
    "[ extend ] in the physically interesting case we have one photon , @xmath49 , and no cancelation can be expected .",
    "moreover , in the far ir the ghost which provides some part of the qg contribution in ( [ extend ] ) , is supposed to decouple , and we come back to the situation described in subsection [ sub3 ] .",
    "the superrenormalizable models of qg have been first formulated in @xcite on the basis of a polynomial action and shortly after that in @xcite on the basis of an action of gravity non - polynomial in derivatives . in the polynomial case",
    "this model of qg has many ( tensor and scalar ) ghosts . in the non - local model of @xcite",
    "there are no ghosts at the tree - level , however loop corrections lead to the emergence of an infinite amount of massive ghost - like states , corresponding to complex poles @xcite .    in both cases",
    "quantum corrections are well - defined , but the @xmath111-function for the parameter @xmath8 can be modified by adjusting the terms of third- and fourth - orders in curvature tensor @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not difficult to construct the theory with the cancelation of the photon contribution in ( [ ombc ] ) .",
    "however , this cancelation will take place in the uv region , where the quantum effects of ghosts are not suppressed .",
    "there is no systematic study of decoupling of massive modes in higher derivative qg , but in principle one can expect that in the ir the massive ghost states will decouple and the low - energy situation will be covered by the effective qg , as described in subsection [ sub3 ] .",
    "after all , superrenormalizable models qg can not be expected to change the sign of @xmath111 in the ir limit .      in ( super)string theory the terms providing the @xmath12-function for the parameter @xmath8",
    "are usually removed by means of the zwiebach transformation @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure is ambiguous @xcite , but , by construction the @xmath12-function for the parameter @xmath8 is zero .",
    "at the same time , string theory is not supposed to provide a significant correction to the quantum field theory results at low and very low energies , for otherwise we would observe such corrections in precision experiments , e.g. , the ones that test qed and standard model calculations . therefore using string theory to evaluate the @xmath111-function in the far ir",
    "is not reasonable from a conceptual point of view .    in conclusion",
    ", we can see that qg can provide the change of sign of the @xmath12-function for @xmath8 , but only at high energies and in the framework of superrenormalizable models of qg of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the ir limit of the qg theory with a number of massive states ( ghosts and normal particles ) should be taken with great care @xcite and it is expected that the sign of the @xmath111-function in ir would remain positive .",
    "hence , we arrive at the conclusion that the main result concerning the positiveness of the @xmath12-function for the parameter @xmath8 remains robust even if gravity is quantized .",
    "as we have seen , there is practically no way to avoid the change of sign of @xmath8 within the anomaly - induced effective action ( [ finaction ] ) .",
    "however , we know that this effective action is based on the artificial minimal substraction ( @xmath117 ) scheme of renormalization .",
    "this scheme is always working perfectly well in the uv . on the other side",
    ", it is known that for the theory of massive quantum fields , this scheme is _ not _ working well in the ir , because of the decoupling theorem @xcite , which was also obtained for semiclassical gravity in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the review and further references ) . in the flat space - time",
    "the masslessness guarantees that the main features of the uv will repeat in the ir , due to the uv - ir `` duality '' of the logarithmic form factor such as the one in ( [ w2 ] ) .",
    "is it true that the situation is the same in curved space - time ?",
    "the question is not simple , especially in the asymptotically ds space , which has a natural ir cut - off scale @xmath118 .",
    "for instance , the scalar curvature in the space with @xmath119 ( with @xmath120 ) has the global scaling similar to the @xmath87 operator , namely @xmath121 in the spacially flat case , but the derivatives here are with respect to conformal time @xmath61 , where @xmath122 . as a result @xmath123",
    "does not run with time , instead it is a constant , @xmath124 .",
    "similar consideration applies to the operator @xmath87 in the logarithm of the form factor in ( [ w2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , let us consider @xmath87 acting on a scalar field @xmath50 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that this scalar depends only on time , @xmath125 .",
    "then a very simple calculation leads to the result & = & + 3 h_0 .",
    "[ box ] one has to note that in the last equation the dependence @xmath126 corresponds to the fiducial ( flat ) metric and , therefore , time derivatives of @xmath50 are expected to be of the same order of magnitude in different epochs .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ box ] ) shows that the dependence of time drops out from the coefficients of the equation for perturbations .",
    "similar calculation for the weyl - squared term provides the result ( here we kept the possibility to @xmath118 be non - constant for the sake of generality ) & & c^ c^ = + & = & ^ \\ { _ t^2 - 4h_t - 2h - 10h^2 } |c^ + & + & 8^t \\ { h_t - h + 2h^2 } |c^t .",
    "[ weyl - box ]    the dependence of space coordinates does not change the result qualitatively , if the wave vector is taken in the physical space , that is after the rescaling @xmath127 .    the expression ( [ weyl - box ] ) shows that in the asymptotic future , where the background becomes very close to de  sitter space , there will not be physical running of @xmath8 .",
    "the reason is that the extreme ir corresponds to ds and has its own scale @xmath118 , such that the correspondence between logarithmic asymptotic ( [ w2 ] ) and anomaly - induced action ( [ finaction ] ) gets violated .",
    "recently , explicit calculations of the curvature - curvature correlators on de  sitter background have been performed in @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that these calculations ( performed by completely different method ) have also shown the absence of leading - log corrections in far ir .",
    "our interpretation of this result is a specific ir decoupling in the ir on de  sitter space background , where @xmath118 plays the role of the natural minimal mass scale .    indeed , according to the same logic , the results for the radiation- and dust - dominated epochs , eqs .",
    "( [ rad a1 ] ) and ( [ mat a1 ] ) are valid and the same is true for the beginning of the transition period between matter and cosmological constant dominating epochs . however",
    ", since we are now in the situation when hubble parameter is quite close to the future constant value @xmath118 , this means the universe is entering the epoch of ir decoupling of all quantum effects in the higher derivative sector of the theory , including the ones of photons .",
    "hence in the real situation the transition to the positive sign of @xmath8 is very improbable .",
    "the anomaly - induced effective action of vacuum is very efficient tool for a local implementation of the renormalization group running .",
    "according to this approach , the semiclassical effects drive the coefficient @xmath8 of the weyl - squared term in the vacuum ( gravitational ) action to the positive side .",
    "it turns out that the one - loop contribution is exact in this case , hence the future of the universe should be related to the tachyonic instabilities . since the time - dependence of @xmath8 is linear , one can easily calculate the time which remains until the change of its sign , that would be an instant when the massive ghost transforms into tachyonic ghost .",
    "the difference between the two types of ghosts is dramatic . for the `` usual '' ghost",
    "there is a mass threshold and hence a possible situation when the ghost is harmless .",
    "the situation can be understood in the spirit of considerations presented in @xcite .",
    "let us note that he approach pursued in these papers by simon and parker and simon is effectively equivalent to the one of @xcite .",
    "in both cases planck frequencies are `` forbidden '' without clear explanation ( we believe that one can find a solution of this problem , but this will be discussed elsewhere ) .",
    "furthermore , in both cases a physically reasonable choice of initial conditions can be done , as a result the system does not fall into the run - away solutions . as a result",
    "higher derivative terms produce only tiny , planck - suppressed corrections and can be simply ignored . for the gravitational waves this means that the dynamics of metric perturbations is essentially the same as in gr , as it was actually shown by starobinsky in the second paper of @xcite .    as far as ghost becomes also tachyon , no mass threshold exist and no reasonable choice of initial conditions can be done .",
    "then an instant explosion of gravitational waves starts at all frequencies , independent on initial conditions .",
    "our calculations show that in the framework of anomaly - induced effective action the transition to tachyonic ghost is unavoidable in the far future of the @xmath62cdm universe .",
    "it is easy to show that the higher - loops corrections do not change this result , at least for the frequencies below the electron mass scale .",
    "however , in the ds - background case , which is a final stage of the @xmath62cdm universe , there is a qualitatively new type of ir decoupling which takes place even for massless fields . as a result ,",
    "the anomaly - induced approximation , which is based on the @xmath117 scheme of renormalization becomes non - appropriate in the ir , exactly as it happens in the massive theory .",
    "therefore , there are no real chances of the tachyonic explosion of the universe even in the far future , since no change of sign of @xmath8 can be expected",
