    "<S> yields , rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the meson resonances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> hadronic rescattering leads to a suppression of reconstructable resonances , especially at low @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> a mass shift of the @xmath8 of 10  mev is obtained from the microscopic simulation , due to late stage @xmath8 formation in the cooling pion gas .    </S>",
    "<S> strange particle yields and spectra are key probes to study excited nuclear matter and to detect the transition of ( confined ) hadronic matter to quark - gluon - matter ( qgp)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relative enhancement of strange and multi - strange hadrons , as well as hadron ratios in central heavy ion collisions with respect to peripheral or proton induced interactions have been suggested as a signature for the transient existence of a qgp - phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a main difficulty in the interpretation of the available data is that the observed final state hadrons carry relatively little information about their primordial sources . </S>",
    "<S> most of the hadrons had been subject to many secondary interactions and are strongly influenced by the decays of high mass resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , first direct experimental information on unstable particle emission in nucleus - nucleus reactions has been reported . at sps @xcite , the @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> have been observed , at the full rhic energy first data on the @xmath4 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath8 mesons and the @xmath1 and @xmath12 baryon resonances are available @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these data are obtained by the reconstruction of final state hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in contrast to the study of @xmath8 mesons by di - leptons ( which are penetrating probes ) , it yields information mostly from the later stages of the reaction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the question of the existence of such resonance states in the hot and dense environment is still not unambiguously answered . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. hyperon resonances are expected to dissolve at high energy densities @xcite and also the @xmath8 is expected to  melt  in the medium @xcite . however , especially for the strange baryon resonances it is expected that late stage regeneration of the resonance is suppressed , therefore there yield might still carry information whether they do exist in the hot and dense region . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of utmost importance to study the cross section of hyperon resonance production at different beam energies and centralities to see whether a specific suppression threshold is present .    to study a possible suppression of resonances and its origin , </S>",
    "<S> the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd 1.2 ) is used @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this microscopic transport approach is based on the covariant propagation of constituent quarks and di - quarks accompanied by mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the leading hadrons of the fragmenting strings contain the valence - quarks of the original excited hadron and represent a simplified picture of the leading ( di)quarks of the fragmenting string . </S>",
    "<S> the elementary hadronic interactions are modelled according to measured cross sections and angular distributions . </S>",
    "<S> if the cross sections are not experimentally known , detailed balance is employed in the energy range of resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the partial and total decay widths are taken from the particle data group . </S>",
    "<S> presently , in - medium modifications of the particle properties , i.e. temperature and density dependent masses and decay widths , are not included in the model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it serves as a benchmark calculation and allows in comparison to experimental data to identify a possible anomalous behaviour in the resonance dynamics . in these proceedings </S>",
    "<S> , we will focus on nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic energies . for a discussion of resonance production at sps and resonance excitation functions within the same approach the reader </S>",
    "<S> is referred to refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . an exploration of the freeze - out conditions in heavy ion reactions from the perspective of a refined thermal model can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , a nucleus - nucleus collision evolves through three distinct stages : ( i ) the initial stage is characterised by high scattering rates and deposits a large amount of ( non - thermalized ) energy around central rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) either partonic or hadronic  cooking  may equilibrate the system until the individual inelastic scattering rates drop as the system cools down - usually called the chemical freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) elastic and pseudo - elastic interactions ( e.g. @xmath13 ) dominate the final stage of the collision , ending with the final break - up of the  fireball  ( kinetic freeze - out ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra and abundances of meson and baryon resonances are well suited to study the break - up dynamics of the source between chemical and kinetic freeze - out .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start by an overview of the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra in central au+au collisions at @xmath14  agev . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dndybaryon ] shows the rapidity densities of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the charged @xmath2 states in central au+au reactions at @xmath14  agev . the left part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dndybaryon ] includes all decaying baryon resonances in the spectrum , while the right part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dndybaryon ] shows the finally observable spectrum of resonances . </S>",
    "<S> different to the experiment , were a mixed event technique is used to obtain an invariant mass spectrum at any given @xmath7 and rapidity , in the present study we define a resonance as observable if its decay products do not interact further after the decay of the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure has the advantage that for each individual observed resonance information on its origin and decay time can be obtained from the model . however </S>",
    "<S> , this definition might yield a slightly stronger suppression of resonances than the mixed event technique , because it assumes that any momentum transfer to the decay products will result in a complete loss of the resonance signal in the invariant mass spectrum of the two correlated hadrons .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dndptbaryon ] shows the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the charged @xmath2 states in central au+au reactions at @xmath14  agev . here </S>",
    "<S> , one observes a significant reduction of the low @xmath7 part of the spectrum , while the high @xmath7 part remains essentially unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent heating of the resonance spectrum is partly due to flow , but mostly due to the higher absorption probability for the decay products of low @xmath7 resonances because they decay already inside the hot and dense region .    </S>",
    "<S> figures [ dndymeson ] and [ dndptmeson ] show the same information for the meson resonances @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the neutral @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the left parts of the figures include all resonances as they decay , while the right parts show only those resonances that are reconstructable from an invariant mass spectrum of final state hadrons . i.e. the left parts of figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ dndymeson ] and [ dndptmeson ] can be studied in the di - lepton channel ( e.g. in the @xmath5 decay , normalised by the branching ratio @xmath15 ) , while the right parts show predictions for the spectra by reconstruction of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 hadron correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> especially the @xmath8 meson with its two distinct decay modes ( @xmath19 vs. @xmath18 ) , which are both accessible by experiment , allows to explore the dynamics and thermodynamic properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we will now focus on the freeze - out and decay of @xmath8 mesons .    in figure [ dndrtrho ] ( left ) the transverse radii at which @xmath5 mesons decay in central au+au reactions at the full rhic energy are shown . </S>",
    "<S> open symbols depict the di - lepton channel ( divided by 5 for better visibility and normalised by the respective branching ratio ) , full symbols show the @xmath5 s reconstructable in the pion channel . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly observes that the @xmath18 channel is mainly sensitive to the outer layers of the interaction region . here , the emission peaks at @xmath20  fm . </S>",
    "<S> studying the @xmath8 in the di - lepton channel however , reveals information mainly from the interior of the reaction zone , with a peak around @xmath21  fm .    the same behaviour is reflected in the decay times of the @xmath8 s at midrapidity ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dndrtrho ] ( right ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> while the pion channel automatically triggers on the final stages of the interaction ( full symbols ) with peak emission at @xmath22  fm / c , the di - lepton channel , shown as open symbols , probes the density and temperature evolution around 10  fm / c after the begin of the interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the @xmath8 yield as observed in the pion channel is dominated by regenerated @xmath8 s . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. since the life time of the @xmath8 state is @xmath23  fm / c , the finally observed @xmath8 mass spectrum and yield is sensitive to the temperature and densities of the pions near the final break - up of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , preliminary star data @xcite seems to indicate a mass shift in the @xmath8 if reconstructed by pion correlations . </S>",
    "<S> a first rough estimate of the @xmath8 mass shift due to a cooling down of the pion gas can be obtained by folding the breit - wigner distribution of the @xmath8 mass with a thermal distribution of temperature @xmath24 : @xmath25 a(m)\\quad;\\quad a(m ) \\sim \\frac{\\gamma_\\rho}{(m - m^{\\rm peak}_\\rho)^2 + ( \\gamma_\\rho/2)^2}\\quad,\\ ] ] for simplicity , phase space factors that modify the tails of the mass distribution are not included here . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the finite width of the @xmath8 results in a temperature dependence of the peak mass of the @xmath8 as given by @xmath26 for decoupling temperatures of interest , 100  mev@xmath27 150  mev , this leads to a downward mass shift of the @xmath8 peak by about 10 - 20  mev . note that in contrast to this simple estimate , the model calculations always includes phase space corrections and mass dependent decay widths for resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> let us compare these estimates for the @xmath8 mass shift to the results obtained in the present model . in figure [ urqmdrhomassimppar ] the centrality dependence of the @xmath8 mass spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is shown for minimum biased au+au reaction at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> when going from peripheral to central collisions one finds a small mass shift in the @xmath8 distribution on the order of 10  mev . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates , that the increased rescattering in central collisions and the regeneration of the @xmath8 due to pion rescattering in the late stage of the reaction can indeed lead to a shift in the @xmath8 mass .    to explore this behaviour further , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ urqmdrhomasspt ] shows the mass distribution of the @xmath5 mesons being reconstructed in the @xmath18 channel in central au+au collision at @xmath14  agev for different @xmath7 windows . here </S>",
    "<S> , the present model predicts a strong transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath8 mass shift . at low @xmath7 the mass shift </S>",
    "<S> exceeds 30  mev , while it vanishes above 1.5  gev in transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this observation also supports , the interpretation of the @xmath8 mass shift in the model as a signal for late stage formation of @xmath8 s due to @xmath18 scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> comparing to the preliminary star data @xcite which yields downward shift of the @xmath8 mass on the order of 60 - 70  mev , the observed mass shift in the simulation is too small . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that the additional mass shift can be interpreted as the onset of brown - rho scaling and various other in - medium modifications of the @xmath8 not included in the present calculation @xcite .    in conclusion , a microscopic transport approach is used to study hadron resonance production in au+au reactions at @xmath28  agev . rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of reconstructable ( strange ) meson and baryon resonances </S>",
    "<S> are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of hadronic rescattering on the resonance yields and spectra are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> special emphasise is put on the @xmath8 mesons , here a comparison between the di - lepton channel and the @xmath18 channel might allow to measure the length of the kinetic rescattering stage in nucleus - nucleus collisions : the di - lepton channel is sensitive to the intermediate stage of the reaction , while the @xmath18 channel yields information about the kinetic freeze - out stage close to the break - up of the hadronic system . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron dynamics near the break - up leads to a mass reduction of the @xmath8 by 10 - 20  mev in central reactions most pronounced at low @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass reduction vanishes towards peripheral reactions and high @xmath7 . </S>"
