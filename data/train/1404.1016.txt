    "our paper focuses on the assouad dimension of such sets .",

    "this dimension was introduced by bouligand @xcite to study bi - lipschitz embeddings and was further studied by assouad in @xcite .",
    "although an interesting notion in its own right , it has found most prominence in the literature due to its relationship with embeddability problems and quasi - conformal mappings . for example , olson @xcite proved that for @xmath11 , @xmath23 implies almost every orthogonal projection of rank @xmath17 is injective on @xmath22 and results in an embedding that is bi - lipschitz except for a logarithmic correction .",
    "this result was extended to subsets of infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces by olson and robinson in @xcite .",
    "further work relating to assouad dimension and embeddings may be found in heinonen  @xcite , luukkainen  @xcite , mackay and tyson  @xcite and robinson  @xcite .",
    "concerning quasi - conformal mappings , there is widespread interest in computing the conformal ( hausdorff or assouad ) dimension in various settings . here",

    "keith and laakso  @xcite study ahlfors regular metric spaces whose assouad dimension can not be lowered by quasi - conformal maps and bonk and kleiner  @xcite apply this work to resolve cannon s conjecture in certain settings .",
    "tyson  @xcite proved that if the conformal assouad dimension of a bounded set in euclidean space is strictly less than 1 , then it is 0 . recently , the assouad dimension has also been gaining substantial attention in the literature on fractal geometry .",

    "we say @xmath4 is _ non - trivial _ if it is not a singleton .",
    "the trivial situation can only occur if all the defining maps have a common fixed point , in which case the attractor is just this point .",

    "the assouad dimension is also an upper bound on the hausdorff dimension ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "most of the commonly used notions of dimension coincide for arbitrary self - similar sets , regardless of separation conditions . indeed , equality of the box , packing and hausdorff dimensions has been long known and follows , for example , from the implicit theorems of falconer  @xcite and mclaughlin  @xcite .",
    "the additional equality with the lower dimension , which is the natural dual to the assouad dimension and is _ a priori _ just a lower bound for the hausdorff dimension , was proved by fraser ( * ? ? ?",

    "an example of this dimension drop is given by the modified sierpiski triangle of ngai and wang ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 , page 670 ) .",
    "it is an important open problem to decide if exact overlaps are the only way such a dimension drop can occur , see for example peres and solomyak  ( * ? ? ?",

    "recently an important step towards solving this problem has been made by hochman @xcite , where it is shown in @xmath41 , assuming the defining parameters for the iterated function system are algebraic , that the only cause for a dimension drop is exact overlaps .",

    "falconer @xcite shows that if the osc is satisfied for some @xmath43 , then the attractor @xmath45 and a result of schief @xcite is that we may assume that @xmath46 .",
    "notably , if the osc is satisfied , then the assouad dimension also coincides with the hausdorff , and thus similarity , dimension .",
    "this result , which has been known in the folklore and essentially dates back to hutchinson , is due to the fact that self - similar sets are ahlfors regular , which is a sufficient condition for equality of hausdorff and assouad dimension . with @xmath47 denoting the @xmath17-dimensional hausdorff measure , recall that a set @xmath27 is called _ ahlfors regular _ if there exist constants @xmath48 such that @xmath49 for @xmath50 , all @xmath51 and all @xmath52 , see heinonen ( * ? ? ?",

    "the assouad dimension of more general attractors has also been considered by , for example , mackay @xcite and fraser @xcite who studied certain planar self - affine constructions .",
    "the weak separation property of lau and ngai @xcite and zerner  @xcite will be our primary tool for studying self - similar sets with overlaps and , indeed , provides a pleasing dichotomy concerning assouad dimension . before describing the weak separation property",

    "for notational convenience define @xmath67 to be the identity map and @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath69 and equip the group of all similarities on @xmath26 with the topology induced by pointwise convergence .",
    "we now define the weak separation property .",
    "[ wsp ] an ifs @xmath42 satisfies the _ weak separation property _ if @xmath70    the weak separation property says that we can not find a sequence of pairs of maps @xmath71 such that @xmath72 gets arbitrarily close but not equal to the identity .",
    "intuitively , this means that the images @xmath73 of the attractor @xmath4 may only overlap in a limited number of ways .",
    "it was shown by zerner @xcite that the open set condition is strictly stronger than the weak separation property .",
    "in particular using results from schief @xcite it was shown that the open set condition is equivalent to @xmath74 .",

    "our main results may be stated as follows . in the case of self - similar sets in the real line",
    "we obtain a precise dichotomy .",
    "[ mainr ] let @xmath4 be a non - trivial self - similar set in @xmath41 .",
    "if the defining ifs for @xmath4 satisfies the weak separation property , then @xmath79 ; otherwise , @xmath80 .    in the case of self - similar sets in @xmath26",
    "we obtain a less precise dichotomy .",

    "if the defining ifs for @xmath4 satisfies the weak separation property , then @xmath79 ; otherwise , @xmath82 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that our assumption that @xmath4 is not contained in a hyperplane is required .",
    "for example , let @xmath4 be the middle third cantor set , embedded in the natural way in @xmath83 , and view it as the attractor of an ifs consisting of three mappings , the first two being the expected maps ( the natural extensions of the maps in the one dimensional ifs to @xmath83 ) and the third one being one of the first two maps composed with an irrational rotation around the one dimensional subspace containing @xmath4 . indeed , the wsp is not satisfied for this system , but @xmath84 .",
    "the problem is that the wsp _ is _ satisfied when one restricts the defining maps to the one dimensional subspace containing @xmath4 .",
    "it is also easy to see that this condition is not restrictive at all because one can always restrict to a linear space with the appropriate dimension , i.e.  where one can not further restrict to any hyperplane , and then apply theorem [ mainrd ] .",
    "theorems [ mainr ] and [ mainrd ] may be broken into two parts .",
    "the first case covers what happens when the weak separation property holds and the second case covers when the weak separation property fails .",
    "section [ wsptrue ] treats the first case ; section [ wspfalse ] treats second case . after proving our main results",
    "we explore some examples which illustrate our theorems and in particular show that the ` equality / maximal ' dichotomy seen in theorem [ mainr ] does not extend to @xmath85 , i.e. , there exist self - similar sets in @xmath85 ( not contained in any hyperplane ) with assouad dimension strictly between the hausdorff dimension and the ambient spatial dimension .",
    "we close with some remarks concerning how we might improve our understanding of the assouad dimension of a self - similar set in @xmath26 when the weak separation property is not satisfied .",
    "our first result shows that the weak separation property implies that the hausdorff and assouad dimensions coincide .",

    "we introduce the notations @xmath87 and @xmath88 note that for @xmath89 we have @xmath90    we remark that the common value for the hausdorff and assouad dimensions given by theorem [ thmwsp ] may be strictly less than the similarity dimension .",
    "this happens when exact overlaps allow certain compositions of maps to be deleted .",
    "in fact , if one takes the infimum over all such ` reduced ifss ' , then zerner ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) shows that this gives the common value .",
    "in particular , if the wsp is satisfied and @xmath4 is not contained in a hyperplane , then @xmath91 to see why this number drops from the original similarity dimension if there are exact overlaps , observe that @xmath92 is a _ set _ of maps rather than a _ multiset _ ,",

    "the problem is that this value may be very difficult to compute .",

    "observe that    @xmath104    thus in order to finish the proof , it suffices to bound @xmath105 independently of @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",

    "another reason for doing this is that theorem  [ mainr ] is the main result of the paper as it provides a precise result in @xmath41 and so it is expedient to give a clear proof of theorem  [ thmnotwsp ] without the extra technical details required in @xmath26 .",
