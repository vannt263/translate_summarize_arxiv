    "starting with two relativistic neutrino species the second ( heavier ) species becomes non - relativistic at @xmath61 .",
    "after @xmath61 the physical states are the eigenstates of an effective hamiltonian for one relativistic neutrino species with a lorentz suppressed mass and one non - relativistic neutrino species .",
    "they can be represented by @xmath62 and @xmath63 fields , where @xmath63 is a linear combination of the @xmath1 ( but is not @xmath64 ) .",
    "we assume the heavier @xmath63 decay while the @xmath62 neutrinos are in equilibrium . at time",
    "@xmath65 the lighter neutrinos @xmath62 go out of equilibrium and later at @xmath66 they become non - relativistic , i.e. , we assume @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the temperature at @xmath65 . thus at @xmath66 one will have a universe with only @xmath62 neutrinos with equal numbers of right - handed and left - handed neutrinos , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "after @xmath66 the effective hamiltonian is as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meff ] ) and the @xmath71 are the eigenstates of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the state of the universe with equal numbers of @xmath69 and @xmath70 can now be described as a linear combination of the @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , a state @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) at @xmath66 can be rewritten in terms of @xmath74 . as in the standard neutrino flavour oscillation scenario ,",
    "the right- and left - handed content of an originally @xmath72 or @xmath73 state will now start to oscillate .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : meff ] ) that the amplitude for @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath76 while the amplitude for @xmath77 is proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "( the amplitudes for @xmath79 are equal and proportional to @xmath80 . ) because of cp violation @xmath81 . therefore ,",
    "though one starts with an equal number of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , more @xmath70 may transform into @xmath82 than @xmath69 into @xmath83 and one ends up with an universe with an unequal content of @xmath69 plus @xmath82 and @xmath70 plus @xmath83 . when the neutrinos subsequently decay one obtains a lepton number asymmetry since right - handed neutrinos decay to leptons and left - handed neutrinos decay to anti - leptons .",
    "( we ignore here asymmetry due to the vertex correction . )",
    "the formalism of ref.@xcite starts with a universe with equal numbers of @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath66 , or , equivalently , with states @xmath72 and @xmath73 with equal probabilities of existing at @xmath66 .",
    "the asymmetry obtained reflects the oscillations in the right - left @xmath44 content that takes place prior to decay . on the other hand ,",
    "the final asymmetry is obtained in ref.@xcite by considering only @xmath84 .",
    "one may argue that typically one does consider the asymmetry generated by only the lightest neutrino .",
    "but what that entails in this scenario is that the heavier @xmath63 neutrino decays while the interactions of the lighter @xmath62 are still in equilibrium , leading to the erasure of any asymmetry generated in the decay of @xmath63 .",
    "subsequently the lightest neutrino @xmath62 goes out of equilibrium , becomes non - relativistic and is re - expressed as a linear combination of both @xmath85 states .",
    "thus one has to consider the lightest @xmath1 species and not the lightest @xmath71 species as the initial state at @xmath66 .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath86 is an asymmetric mixture of @xmath87 and @xmath88 its decay gives a lepton asymmetry .",
    "ref.@xcite also argues against starting with the @xmath71 states as these are  propagation \" states which the authors claim are not physical .",
    "however our observations are based on a cosmological argument rather than a field theoretic argument .",
    "( we shall also state the field theoretic argument later . )",
    "the importance of the initial state is also discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "our arguments above do not apply to scenarios where @xmath89 , i.e. , when the neutrinos are non - relativistic when they go out of equilibrium . in such cases , from a cosmological standpoint , @xmath90 will be the relevant asymmetry parameter .    in the limit of large mass splittings ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath91 , the asymmetry obtained in ref.@xcite is similar to that obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that the approximations needed to obtain this result , i.e. , ignoring terms proportional to @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( 17 ) of ref.@xcite and assuming a small mixing angle is equivalent to ignoring the asymmetry from the interference between @xmath95 and @xmath64 and from @xmath64 decay and to setting @xmath96 .",
    "however in the small mass splitting case the asymmetry obtained in refs.@xcite are not similar , as we show later .",
    "our arguments imply that one has a mixed state ( as opposed to a pure state ) of @xmath72 and @xmath73 with equal probabilities at @xmath65 .",
    "thereafter one evolves the @xmath97 states independently . since the mass term is not significant when @xmath62 is relativistic there will be no significant mixing till @xmath66 .",
    "after @xmath66 both @xmath97 can be rewritten as pure states of @xmath86 and @xmath98 and hence one gets interference between @xmath86 and @xmath98 states which is necessary for left - right oscillations .",
    "however if one argues that one instead has a mixed state of @xmath74 at @xmath66 then one would evaluate @xmath90 as in ref.@xcite . in that case the initial number densities of the @xmath71 particles that enter into the solution of the botzmann equation would be weighted by the probabilities of obtaining the @xmath71 at @xmath66 , given by @xmath99 .",
    "one would then include the contributions of both @xmath71 to the total asymmetry since the asymmetry generated by the decay of @xmath64 will not be erased as @xmath95 interactions are out of equilibrium at @xmath66 .",
    "we now raise more fundamental issues with both the approaches using the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is defined in refs.@xcite using decay rates for rotated fields @xmath71 with complex masses .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite ( in the context of kaon physics ) that the lack of orthonormality of the @xmath74 states raises ambiguities in the normalisation of states making it difficult to interpret @xmath100 as the probability amplitude for @xmath101 .",
    "if one normalises @xmath74 as @xmath102 then the state is scale dependent .",
    "this is because @xmath103 implies @xmath104 since @xmath105 and @xmath106 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one normalises the @xmath53 states as @xmath107 then @xmath108 \\langle f|f\\rangle\\ne1 $ ] .",
    "this can be better understood by considering the quantum mechanical example of kaon mixing with @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath109 ( or @xmath110 ) and @xmath111 corresponding to @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "a similar argument can be extended to field theoretic scenarios .",
    "if @xmath71 are intermediate particles , i.e. , if one includes a production amplitude for the @xmath71 , the above concerns do not apply @xcite .",
    "if one does include a production amplitude for the @xmath71 in @xmath90 it will cancel out in the numerator and denominator leaving behind the asymmetry parameter as defined in refs.@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite the asymmetry parameter is defined in terms of decay rates of the mixed @xmath1 fields .",
    "it has been pointed out in ref.@xcite that in general there does not exist a fock space for mixed fields .",
    "if one assumes that the annihilation operators of the @xmath71 fields and the creation operators of the @xmath114 fields obey canonical anticommutation relations then the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath1 fields satisfy , for example,@xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 represent helicity , @xmath117 , the sum is over the mass eigenstates , @xmath118 and @xmath119 include spinor elements as in ref.@xcite and we have used @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "these anticommutation relations are non - diagonal in the @xmath122 indices and are hence not canonical . therefore if @xmath121 , @xmath123 is not a well defined statement in general .",
    "furthermore , the two cases in which one can define an approximate fock space for the @xmath44 fields , namely , the extreme relativistic limit and almost degenerate masses with real @xmath34 @xcite do not apply to our problem .    in the limit that all the neutrino species are non - relativistic , as is the case for @xmath124 , the above commutation relations are diagonal in the @xmath125 indices .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath44 fields are no longer time - independent in this case .",
    "but if one starts with an @xmath1 state as the initial state at @xmath66 and evolves it as a linear combination of @xmath71 states then this may not be a problem since one requires that the relation @xmath123 hold at only one instant , namely , at @xmath66 .",
    "note that in ref.@xcite the states @xmath126 and @xmath127 are in co - ordinate space .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators for the mixed fields in co - ordinate space , namely , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , do satisfy diagonal anticommutation relations .",
    "it was pointed out by veltman that it is inappropriate to have unstable particles as asymptotic in or out states@xcite . to avoid this problem",
    "different effective approaches have been adopted to obtain the one loop decay amplitude . in refs.@xcite",
    "the authors use an one loop effective hamiltonian . in ref.@xcite the decay amplitude",
    "is obtained by splitting a two particle scattering amplitude with the unstable particle as the intermediate particle . in ref.@xcite",
    "one obtains the decay amplitude from an effective lsz formulation .",
    "we discuss here the differences and similarities in the above approaches to obtain the asymmetry .    broadly speaking , one can further divide the different approaches into those that use unrotated fields @xmath1 to define the initial state , such as refs.@xcite and those that work with rotated fields to define the initial state , such as refs.@xcite fields may not be possible . ] . though refs.@xcite deal with rotated fields their approaches are somewhat different .",
    "below we first compare the rotating matrices for all these approaches in the small and large mass difference limits .",
    "we also comment on ref.@xcite .",
    "we finally re - evaluate the asymmetry in the small mass difference limit .",
    "in ref.@xcite the authors obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the effective mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : meff ] ) . in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors obtain the eigenvalues and eigenkets of the two off - diagonal blocks of @xmath29 . in general , the eigenvalues of the two off - diagonal blocks of the matrix do not equal each other or the eigenvalues of the full matrix and the eigenkets of the off - diagonal blocks describe particles different from those related to the eigenkets of the full matrix .    one can show that the eigenvalues of the two off - diagonal blocks are the same as that of the larger matrix , and the eigenvectors of the larger matrix are trivial combinations of corresponding eigenvectors of the smaller blocks when the two off - diagonal blocks are the same . in the limit of a small mass difference @xmath130 , @xmath131 and we find that the diagonalising matrices are equivalent and one gets the same asymmetry .",
    "for example , the matrix relating the right handed field projections @xmath132 and @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 for both approaches .",
    "the above matrix is obtained from @xmath33 of section 1 and we have not shown the normalisation .",
    "however in the limit of a large mass difference @xmath136 the relation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 is given by @xmath137 and @xmath138 for refs.@xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "one can see that they are not equivalent .",
    "we find that working with the 2x2 matrices in this limit gives an asymmetry that is approximately 1/2 of the asymmetry obtained using the 4x4 approach .",
    "this can be traced to the absence of the contribution of the term proportional to @xmath139 . once again , if @xmath140 are real @xmath141 and the diagonalising matrices of the two approaches become identical .    in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors also consider the eigenvalues of the two blocks of a 4x4 effective mass matrix .",
    "however our above arguments do not apply to this case as the two blocks are along the diagonal and are transposes of each other , necessitating that the eigenvalues of the two 2x2 blocks are the eigenvalues of the larger matrix and that the eigenvalues of each block are the same , and the eigenvectors of the larger matrix are a trivial combination of the eigenvectors of the blocks .",
