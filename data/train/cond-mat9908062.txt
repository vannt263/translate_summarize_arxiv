    "conjugated molecules have attracted the attention of chemists and physicists since the early days of quantum mechanics .",

    "proposed a model specifically devoted to the polyacetylene  known as the ssh model  where the role of the electron  phonon interaction is especially emphasized @xcite ; here , the polyacetylene is thought of as a peierls insulator and the solitons , polarons and bipolarons as the major relevant excitations in this system . a very nice review of these early studies is included in the book of l. salem @xcite and a review about the ssh model can be found in the next reference @xcite .    as a counterpart to this one  electron theory ,",
    "the major role of electron correlation was soon recognized . in the fifties , the celebrated pariser  parr ",
    "pople ( ppp ) hamiltonian was suggested as a possible candidate for the studies of conjugated oligomers @xcite .",
    "later , ovchinnikov et al . suggested to consider conjugated polymers as mott ",
    "hubbard instead of peierls insulators @xcite .",
    "then , one has to face a n  body problem with a strong coulomb interaction with a non ",
    "zero range ; it was subject to many numerical works such as exact diagonalizations of very small oligomers @xcite , selected ci calculations @xcite and , quite recently , density matrix renormalization group studies @xcite .",
    "the ppp hamiltonian was also a preferential model to support the development of new methods before applying them to more realistic models ; a very good example of such work is given by the coupled ",
    "cluster method first implemented in quantum chemistry for the ppp hamiltonian @xcite .    today",
    ", it is well recognized that both the electron  phonon and electron  electron interactions are equally important @xcite .",
    "moreover , interchain interaction and disorder are also of importance .",
    "therefore , the problems one has to face to fully understand conjugated polymers stay quite challenging as it is the case for most of the recent organic compounds including high tc superconductors . despite a large amount of work , from the early thirties to now ,",
    "the main questions remain awaiting an answer ! for instance , a comprehensive picture for the ground state of these systems is still needed ; it is the goal of this work to propose a relatively simple and , we believe , promising , way to understand the ground state of conjugated polymers .",
    "more generally , one dimensional correlated electron systems appear over the years as a growing and important field in condensed matter theory . one main reason of that comes from the fact that these systems serve as a theoretical laboratory to explore new methods of solution , analytically or numerically . a second main reason  we would say more physical  comes from the fact that over the years , more and more experimental realisations of these systems appear .",
    "new concepts emerge from such studies as the ones included in the phenomenology of luttinger ",
    "liquids @xcite .    among the technical methods proper to the one dimensional geometry",
    ", one may cite the bethe ansatz @xcite , the bosonization techniques @xcite , and , more recently , the density  matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite and a closely related scheme which is directly considered in this note , the recurrent variational approach ( rva ) @xcite .",
    "the two first methods are analytical and the third one is numerical ; the rva method is in between .",
    "the rva , presented here , is a variational method invented recently in the context of spin ",
    "ladders @xcite .",
    "it is a method very closely related to the dmrg scheme with the main differences coming from the fact that only one state is retained as the best candidate for the ground state in the rva on the contrary to the dmrg which considered much more states @xcite .",
    "most often , the results obtained with it are less accurate than the dmrg ones , but it is much easier to get a physical insight into the problem ; the analysis of the results is simpler and the rva could provide a `` physical '' picture of some phenomena which , we believe , are of utmost importance in the field of conjugated polymers where the most important ingredient are still not fully recognized @xcite .",
    "this note is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the rva is presented using the example of the two  leg spin ladders . in section iii",
    ", the rva method is applied to the study of the dimerized chain described by the extended peierls  hubbard model . a nice similarity between the two  leg ladder and this system",
    "is pointed out and comparisons with dmrg calculations are made .",
    "we conclude in section iv and give some reasonable perspectives .",
    "a spin ladder is an array of coupled spin chains .",
    "the horizontal chains are called the legs , the vertical ones , rungs . in the case of spin one",
    " half antiferromagnet spin  ladders , these systems show a remarkable behaviour in function of the number of leg : there is a gap in the excitation spectrum of even  leg ladders and , on the contrary , no gap in the excitation spectrum of odd  leg ladders . in terms of correlation lengths",
    ", this means that there is short ( long ) range spin correlation in even ( odd ) leg ladder ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the even  leg ladders show a spin - liquid ground state described by a resonance valence bond ( rvb ) state introduced by p.w .",
    "anderson @xcite ; such systems may be efficiently described by using a direct  space method as the dmrg and rva ones . in this note",
    ", we will consider only the simplest even  leg ladder , the two  leg ladder , and we will describe it with the simplest rvb state , the dimer  rvb state where the elementary singlets are between two nearest  neighbour sites .",
    "this problem is easily solved by using the rva method @xcite . moreover , with the same scheme , it is possible straightforwardly to go beyond the simple dimer  rvb state by considering more extended elementary singlets @xcite , and to study more complex systems as the four  leg ladders for instance @xcite . in principle , this method should be relevant for every one  dimensional system with exponentially decreasing correlation lengths as conjugated polymers @xcite .",
    "in this note we consider the simplest case given by the two  leg ladder ( see figure ( [ ladder ] ) ) .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is the following @xmath0where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are the exchange integral for the leg ( rung ) with @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the number of rungs of the ladder and open periodic boundary conditions have been assumed .    in the limit where @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath1 , the ground state of ( [ heisenberg ] ) is simply given by the product of singlets localized along the rungs ( see fig .",
    "( [ 0resonon ] ) ) . starting from this limit",
    ", one may include fluctuations around it to treat the general case described by the hamiltonian ( [ heisenberg ] ) .",
    "a minimal way to do it , is to consider instead of singlet on rungs , pairs of nearest neighbour singlets on the leg ; these local fluctuations are called resonon in the rest of the paper . therefore , the resonance mechanism  in the sense of pauling @xcite  we will consider in the following are represented in figure ( [ resonance ] ) .    with the two selected local configurations , the singlet localized on a rung and the resonon",
    ", we have to generate the corresponding hilbert space ; the configurations are characterized by the number of resonon , @xmath6 , and their positions , @xmath7 , as it is shown in the next examples .",
    "the hilbert space is splitted according to the number of resonon ; we have then to consider    * the zero  resonon sector with one unique state @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ 0resonon ] ) , + * the one  resonon sector with the states @xmath9 ( fig .",

    "@xmath14 is a variational parameter to be determined upon minimization of the ground  state energy . as a result ,",
    "it is a function of the ratio of couplings , namely , @xmath15 .    since we kept only two very localized building blocks , it is possible to generate the state ( [ 18 ] ) in a recursive manner which we present now .",
    "denoting by @xmath16 a generic rvb state ( [ 18 ] ) for a two  leg ladder of @xmath5 rungs , there are only two possibilities or _",
    "movements _ to create generic rvb states of higher length , namely ,    * addition of one vertical rung to create the state @xmath17 , * addition of one pair of horizontal bonds ( resonon ) to create @xmath18 .    from these arguments we can establish that the dimer  rvb states ( [ 18 ] ) satisfy a",

    "one can generate recursively the dimer rvb state @xmath27 from previous states with lower length and estimate variationally the ground ",
    "state energy as ,    @xmath28    the value of @xmath14 is fixed by minimization of ( [ 25 ] ) .      to compute the norms of the states (",
    "[ 18 ] ) let us define    @xmath29    the two selected local configurations are not orthogonal , it is then convenient to define an auxiliary function @xmath30 as follows ,    @xmath31    the second order rr s for the states leads ( [ 23 ] ) to a closed set of rr s for the overlaps @xmath32 , namely ,    @xmath33    where we have made use of the result ,    @xmath34    the rr s ( [ 28 ] ) together with the initial conditions ,    @xmath35    determine @xmath36 and @xmath30 for arbitrary values of @xmath5 as functions of @xmath14 .",
    "note that instead of introducing the function @xmath30 , it is also possible to make first linear combination of our building blocks , making used of ( [ 29 ] ) @xcite , in order to guaranty the orthogonality between the selected local configurations .",
    "the overlap would then be given by only one recurrent relation as it will be the case in the next section .",
    "the expectation values of the hamiltonian can be determined following the same steps outlined above . to this end",
    ", we introduce the quantities ,    @xmath37    to obtain the rr s satisfied by @xmath38 , one splits the hamiltonian @xmath39 of a two  leg ladder of length @xmath5 ( [ heisenberg ] ) into two pieces :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the hamiltonian of length @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the rest of the whole @xmath44 hamiltonian , @xmath45 , which is made of one vertical rung and two horizontal links . with this splitting and using ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) , we obtain ,    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the lowest eigenvalue of the operator @xmath48 .",
    "the initial conditions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are    @xmath51    the rr s for the energies involve the norms of the states and depend both on @xmath14 and the coupling constants @xmath52 .    by working with orthogonal building blocks @xcite",
    ", it is also possible to go back to only one recurrent equation for the expectation value as for the norm ; this will be the case in section 3 .",

    "however , due to the alternance between monomers , which can be large , and the link ( the single bond ) between the monomers , we will underline in this work a remarkable similarity between conjugated polymers and two  leg ladder .",
    "a similar wave function than ( [ 18 ] ) are proposed here for conjugated polymers - the rung of the ladder is played by the monomer and the resonon excitation of the two  leg ladder by a set of intermonomer fluctuations @xcite .",

    "we choose as model system the simplest conjugated polymers  the trans  polyacetylene .",
    "this compound shows a dimerized structure with an alternance between double bond ( 1.35 ) and single bond ( 1.45 ) ; the monomer is then simply a double bond ( see figure ( [ fig55 ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath150 electrons are assumed to be effectively describe not by the full ppp hamiltonian but by the extended peierls  hubbard model ( eph ) @xcite , a short version of it , for simplicity    @xmath151    the operator @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath154 at site @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",

    "neighbour charge density  charge density interaction .",
    "we will note in the following for convenience , @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the hopping term for the double and the single bond respectively .",
    "because of the dimerization , the one electron density is more pronounced on the double bonds than on the single bonds ; this is more and more apparent when the dimerization increases .",
    "more generally , this is the case for every conjugated polymers where the one  electron density is peaked on the monomer region . in this sense ,",
    "conjugated polymers are not strictly one dimensional systems but rather intermediate between quasi  zero and quasi  one dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "it seems then convenient to perform a unitary transformation which favours the orbitals localized on the monomers , in our case , on the double bonds .",
    "the new operators are then given by    @xmath164    these operators create or annihilate @xmath150 electrons in the corresponding bonding or antibonding orbitals of the double bond @xmath155 ( see figure ( [ fig55 ] ) ) .    as for the case of the two  leg ladder , we select the local configurations ( lc ) which are the much important for the ground state wave function .",
    "this selection of the relevant lc is made by combining energetic and symmetry considerations .",
    "for that purpose , we use the electron  hole symmetry operator , @xmath165 , to classify the lc . on the fock space of a single site @xmath155 ,",
    "the action of this operator are summarized as follows @xcite    @xmath166    the electron ",
    "hole symmetry operators for several site is just given by the direct product of such single site operator @xmath167 .",
    "the electronic configurations can be splitted into two classes of electron  hole symmetry denoted by ( + ) and (  ) .",
    "the ground state is in the ( + ) sector , @xmath168 ; therefore we select the lowest lc in energy which belong to this class of symmetry .",
    "we kept only four of such lc , represented in figure ( [ lc ] ) which were shown as the most important ones in finite cluster diagonalizations @xcite .",
    "we present briefly now these lc ; their associated creation operator and their energy .",
    "they are classified in two categories following their extension : the lc localized on one double bond are called molecular configurations ( mc )  to underline the analogy with molecular crystals ; the lc extended over two nearest  neighbour double  bonds are named nearest  neighbour ",
    "intermonomer  fluctuations ( nnif ) . in such classification , the singlet on the rungs of the previous section enters in the first class and the resonon in the second one .",
    "the mc are the lc completely localized on the monomers .",
    "they give an appropriated description of the system in the strong dimerized limit .",
    "there is two kinds of mc in the ( + ) electron  hole symmetry sector @xcite .",
    "* in the first , the monomer @xmath155 is in its ground state ; it is described by the following creation operator + @xmath169 + for a reasonable choice of parameters , this is the lowest lc in energy so that we choose as reference state @xmath170where @xmath171 is the state without any @xmath150 electron . with respect to this reference state , the local operator @xmath172 is simply given by the unity @xmath173 .",
    "we have named this lc , @xmath174-lc . in the following all the creation operators and the energies",
    "are defined with respect to @xmath175 . * in the second , the monomer @xmath155 is doubly excited ; this lc is associated with the following local operator + @xmath176 + with energy given by @xmath177 .",
    "this lc introduces electronic correlation inside a particular double bond .",
    "we have named this lc @xmath178-lc .",
    "notes that the lc where a monoexcitation take place in a double bond , let s call it @xmath179-lc , lower in energy than the @xmath178-lc , is in the (  ) electron  hole symmetry sector ; therefore , it will be a local constituent for excited states @xcite .",
    "these two lc are the analogue of the singlet along the rung for the two  leg ladder .      with the two mc ,",
    "the electrons are coupled by pairs on the double bonds and the resulting picture is the one of a molecular crystal in its ground state @xcite ; the analogue for the two  leg ladder is given by the state @xmath175 represented in figure ( [ 0resonon ] ) with only singlets along the rungs .",
    "this crude picture is obviously not adapted for conjugated polymers where @xmath150 electrons are delocalized on the whole chain . as in the case of the two  leg ladder , fluctuations must be included in our treatment , we talk in this case of intermonomer fluctuations .",
    "this will be done in a somehow minimal way by considering the two following lc , extending over two double bonds only @xcite .    * in the first , one electron is transfered from one monomer to the nearest ",
    "neighbour one ; this operation is associated with the local operator written as @xmath180with energy @xmath181 .",
    "this lc introduces some nearest  neighbour intermonomer charge fluctuation reproducing in a minimal way the conjugaison phenomenom .",
    "we named this lc , @xmath182-lc .",
    "* in the second , some intermonomer spin fluctuation is introduced by combining two n.n .",
    "triplets into a singlet ; the corresponding operator is @xmath183with energy given by @xmath184 ; this lc is named @xmath185-lc .",
    "there is more lc extended over two n.n .",
    "bonds within the ( + ) electron  hole symmetry class  and , of course , there is much more lc more extended  but we believe the two selected ones are the more important . for instance , we saw that the @xmath179-lc is in the (  ) class of symmetry , however , with the simple product form of the electron - hole symmetry operator , a lc with two @xmath179-lc  or more generally with an even number of @xmath179-lc  is in the ( + ) class of symmetry and should be considered here . however , this kind of lc are sufficiently high in energy to be reasonably neglected .",
    "these two lc are the analogue of the resonon configuration for the two  leg ladder .      with our choice of four lc , all possible electronic configurations",
    "are then build up .",
    "they are characterized by the number of @xmath178 , @xmath182 and @xmath185-lcs , @xmath186 , @xmath187 and @xmath188 respectively , and by the positions of these different local configurations .",

    "a finite system dmrg algorithm is used to calculate the ground state energy for several chain lengths up to four hundred sites and the energy per site is then extrapolated to the infinite lattice limit . the numerical error in the energy per site of the infinite lattice is estimated to be of the order of @xmath226 or smaller .",

    ", we show the energy per site obtained from dmrg and rva calculations for different values of the dimerization parameter @xmath159 . for @xmath243 ,",
    "the chain is fully dimerized ; the results given by the ansatz ( [ gs ] ) is then very accurate per construction .",
    "next , the accuracy of the rva results decreases when the dimerization decreases ; this appear clearly in the table iii . for values relevant for conjugated polymers , @xmath159 larger than 0.25 , the energy approaches 90@xmath244 of the dmrg energy ; we think these results satisfactory according to the relative simplicity of our proposed trial wave function ( [ gs ] ) : only four local configurations are retained ! this wave function is , in a sense , an extrapolation of the wave function analysed in small cluster calculations @xcite , to an infinite lattice .",
    "of course some improvements are suitable and may include more extended lc ; by the way , works are currently in progress in that direction by using again the recurrent variational approach .",
    "nevertheless , we believe the wave function ( [ gs ] ) sufficient to get a first explanation of some physical phenomena as the very strong linear absorption due to excitonic states observed in polydiacetylenes @xcite .",
    "last , it is well known that the ground state of the eph model shows a bond order wave if @xmath245 and a charge density wave in the other case @xcite . in figure ( [ dmrgrva ] ) , we show the relative error of the rva results compared to the dmrg ones for several choices of coulombic parameters in function of the dimerization parameter @xmath159 , in the two different regimes . once again , the results show clearly that our ansatz is better when @xmath159 increases",
    ". moreover , its behaviour seems different in the two sides of the transition , this is natural since our ansatz is not appropriated to describe properly a charge density wave .",
    "to conclude , we have presented in this note the recurrent variational approach and , more specifically , its first application to the electronic structure of conjugated polymers .",
    "the ansatz built here ( [ gs ] ) , shows some nice similarities with the trial state ( [ 23 ] ) made for the two  leg ladder .    by comparisons with density matrix renormalization group calculations",
    ", we think this trial wave function encouraging and a good starting point for further improvements .",
    "moreover , we believe such kind of simple wave functions useful to get some analytical insight into physical phenomena @xcite .    two natural extensions of this work are currently in progress : first , it is possible , in some extents , to improve the simple ansatz ( [ gs ] ) by including more local configurations ; second , it is also possible to apply the method to other conjugated polymers of current interests as the poly  paraphenylene and the poly  paraphenylenevinylene .",
