    "it is known that there exists a lot of hidden mass in the universe , and its interaction with usual matter is very weak",
    ". such weakness of interaction allows us to suppose without contradiction with experiment , that hidden mass contains fields , which do not satisfy usual restrictions imposed on the spectrum of 4-momentum . in this work",
    "we consider the properties of scalar nonhermitian fields of such type and discuss applications of these fields .",
    "although the mentioned fields are of special interest in cosmology , we consider as the first step the case of flat space - time . with the exception of the requirements for the spectrum of 4 momentum , which we refuse , all other postulates of quantum field theory and in particular the property of local commutativity are kept in the following consideration .",
    "we consider scalar local fields both with discrete and continues mass spectrum .",
    "these fields may have positive or negative square of mass and positive or negative energy in the case of positive square of mass .",
    "let us remark , that some time ago a theory of tachyonic fields ( i.e. fields with negative square of mass ) was proposed based on the assumption that only particles with positive energy can be created [ 1 ] .",
    "such tachyonic scalar fields fulfill anticommutation relations .",
    "no field , annihilating the vacuum exists in this model . on the contrary",
    "we suppose that states with arbitrary sign of energy can be created , assuming for consistency with experiment that the interaction with conventional matter is extremely weak .",
    "this permits us to use commutation relations between scalar fields only .",
    "in such a way we get the local field annihilating the vacuum and apply it in subsequent consideration .    in the second section the generalization of kallen - lehmann representation for the propagator of nonhermitian scalar field",
    "is deduced under assumptions described above .",
    "it is clarified that cpt- violation in local lorentz invariant theory may take place , if we abandon ordinary requirements for the spectrum of 4-momentum . at the cost of such violation it is possible to construct nonzero local field annihilating the vacuum state .",
    "we shall use _ * free * _ field of such type in the following consideration for particular applications .    in the third chapter",
    "it is shown , how generalized free field with arbitrary spectrum of 4-momentum can be constructed , if its propagator coincides with the one , given by general expression found in section 2 .    in the forth section the local relativistic generalization of lindblad equation for density matrix",
    "is introduced as an example of usage of the fields mentioned above . in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics such equation",
    "allows , in particular , to describe in a unique way the evolution of a quantum system over time as well as the measurement process .",
    "generalization of quantum theory by the passage from @xmath1 equation to lindblad equation is especially advisable in cosmology to describe the early universe . in this case",
    "it is meaninglessly to speak about any external devices making measurements over the universe .",
    "that s why one needs an equation which provides spontaneous transformation of superposition of macroscopically different states of the universe into one of them .",
    "in order to apply lindblad equation for this purpose , one has to write its relativistic generalization for flat space - time , and then pass to riemann - space of gravitational theory .",
    "here we consider only the first part of this problem , and assume the space - time to be flat . trying to construct a local relativistic generalization of lindblad equation , using only fields with conventional spectrum of 4-momentum operator",
    ", one meets irresistible ultraviolet ( u.v . below ) divergencies [ 2 ] .",
    "however , in section 4 it is shown that such generalization exists for the free field annihilating the vacuum .",
    "it should be noted , that the authors of the work [ 3 ] with an eye to describe the evolution of nonrelativistic quantum system and measurement process in a unique way , used stochastic @xmath1 equation , which corresponds to specified lindblad equation .",
    "these authors emphasize , that the usage of corresponding lindblad equation does not mean yet the passage to realistic description which provides all macroscopic quantities with definite values .",
    "it is connected with the fact , that the density matrix @xmath2 can be presented as a sum of projectors onto pure states in different ways and the lindblad equation does not give an instruction which of them should be chosen .",
    "nevertheless , if the density matrix @xmath3 satisfies the lindblad equation and can be presented as a sum of projectors onto macroscopically definite states at every moment of time @xmath4 at least in one way , then apparently one can construct stochastic @xmath1 equation which generates this lindblad equation .",
    "so we describe the lindblad equation only .    in the fifth section we consider u.v .",
    "divergencies arising when one introduces the interaction between the field annihilating the vacuum and ordinary fields . in the investigated examples these divergencies have unusual nature and can not be removed by renormalization . in particular",
    ", it inhibits to use the considered local lindblad equation for description of collapse of the state vector of usual fields .",
    "for every function @xmath26 we introduce the fourier transform @xmath27 , assuming that @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "because of lorentz invariance , the fourier - transforms @xmath30,@xmath31 of the quantities @xmath32 , @xmath33 , defined by the formulas ( 2.4 ) , can depend only on @xmath34 when @xmath35 , and on @xmath34 as well as on the sign of @xmath36 when @xmath37 , so and @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for short . ]",
    "@xmath41 now we introduce complete set of eigenvectors @xmath42 of 4-momentum operator @xmath43 : @xmath44 the states @xmath42 are normalized in such a manner , that the unity operator @xmath45 has the following form @xmath46 .",
    "due to translation invariance @xmath47 based on the formulas ( 2.4 ) , ( 2.6 ) , ( 2.7 ) , ( 2.9 ) and the relations @xmath48 one finds , that @xmath49 this implies , that @xmath50 one sees , that nonnegative functions @xmath15 and @xmath51 are defined by 4-momentum spectrum of physical states of the theory . further we show , that casual green function @xmath25 can be expressed through @xmath15 and @xmath51 , and it turns out , that this quantities are subordinated to some conditions due to ( 2.1b ) .",

    "now we shall investigate the analytical continuation into the region of complex @xmath64 , i.e. we allow the vector @xmath64 in the formulas @xmath65 to take complex values .",
    "we shall assume , that @xmath60 , @xmath66 @xmath67 are distributions of slow growth ( from @xmath68 ) . then @xmath69 are analytical functions of the argument @xmath64 at those its values for which the first integral ( 2.21 ) , or correspondingly the second , exists . with changing @xmath70 to @xmath71 and vice versa . ]    according to ( 2.18 ) , ( 2.19 ) @xmath72 @xmath73 but due to lorentz invariance , the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 can depend only on @xmath34 in those region , where they are analytical .",
    "the region of analyticity contains those @xmath34 , which can be expressed through @xmath64 under the condition ( 2.22 ) ( correspondingly ( 2.23))at least in a one way .",
    "it is easy to check , that conditions ( 2.22 ) , ( 2.23 ) can be satisfied at every @xmath34 , expect those ones , for which @xmath76 so , in the region of analyticity we have @xmath77 and the functions @xmath78,@xmath79 are analytical in a whole complex @xmath34-plane , probably with the exception of the positive real axis .",
    "the functions @xmath80 , @xmath81 at @xmath82 can be expressed through @xmath78 , @xmath79 , going to the limit from those @xmath64 , for which @xmath83 ( correspondingly @xmath84 ) is analytical .",
    "taking into account ( 2.22),(2.23 ) , it is easy to conclude , that at real @xmath64 @xmath85 in the following we consider @xmath64 to be real and write the formulas ( 2.26 ) without the sign of limit . due to the definition ( 2.14 ) @xmath86 ( *",
    "-is a sign of complex conjugation ) .",
    "thus , using ( 2.15 ) , we find , that @xmath87 and because of ( 2.26 ) @xmath88 this means , that analytical functions @xmath89 , @xmath90 satisfy the condition @xmath91 at every complex @xmath92 . in the following we shall write @xmath93 instead of @xmath90 . so according to ( 2.26 ) , ( 2.29 )",
    "@xmath94 @xmath95 thus due to ( 2.20 ) @xmath96    the analytical function @xmath93 has a cut along the positive real axis , where the relation ( 2.33 ) is true .",
    "so @xmath93 can be reconstructed using the functions @xmath15 and @xmath51 , if they are defined at @xmath97 .",
    "we shall do it at first imposing restrictions on the function @xmath93 strong enough , to provide its uniqueness , and later we shall discuss the arbitrariness , caused by weakening these restrictions .",
    "let us introduce into consideration the function @xmath98 of complex variable @xmath92 and let us define the branch of the square root as follows : if @xmath99 , then @xmath100 thus at real @xmath34 in the limit @xmath101 with @xmath102 @xmath103 let us define the functions @xmath104 then because of ( 2.34 ) @xmath105 furthermore the functions @xmath106 have the same analytical properties , as the function @xmath93 .",
    "let us assume , that , when @xmath107 , the functions @xmath106 decrease not slower than @xmath108 , but when @xmath109 they increase not faster than @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",
    "then due to ( 37 ) the following dispersion relations are true : @xmath112 so according to ( 2.35 ) , ( 2.36 ) at @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 taking into account the relations ( 2.33),(2.38),(2.39),(2.40 ) , we conclude that @xmath116 @xmath117 finally , because of ( 2.36 ) @xmath118 @xmath119 here @xmath120at @xmath121 , @xmath122 and similarly for @xmath123,@xmath124,@xmath125    let us consider the equality ( 2.43 ) from the point of view of @xmath0-transformation . at such transformation the matrix element @xmath126",
    "goes into @xmath127 @xmath128 and vice versa , or according to ( 2.4 ) , ( 2.6),(2.7 ) @xmath129 so , the first term in the right hand side of the equality ( 2.43 ) is @xmath0- invariant , while the second one is not @xmath0- invariant . assuming that @xmath130 in the formula ( 2.43 ) , taking the imaginary part of the function @xmath131 and using ( 2.33 ) at @xmath35",
    ", we obtain the relation @xmath132 @xmath133 one sees , that @xmath0- noninvariant parts of the spectrum are not arbitrary , but they are coupled by the relation ( 2.45 ) .",
    "this is a result of the locality of the theory . in the equality ( 2.45 )",
    "the expression @xmath134 describes the @xmath0- violation in the spectrum of states with @xmath135 and positive energy , the difference @xmath136 - in the spectrum of states with nonnegative @xmath137 , but with negative energy and , finally , @xmath138- in the spectrum of tachyonic states ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "let us notice , that @xmath0-invariant parts of the spectrum @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 can be defined arbitrary .",
    "now let us consider the propagator @xmath25 , defined by the equality ( 2.5 ) . using the relations ( 2.4 ) , ( 2.5 ) , ( 2.14 ) , ( 2.15 ) one sees , that @xmath25 might be written , in particular , in two ways :",
    "@xmath142 using the equalities ( 2.31 ) , ( 2.7 ) we obtain for the fourier transform @xmath143 @xmath144 i.e. in accordance with ( 2.43 ) @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147 or @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 this is the required generalization of kallen - lehmann representation .",
    "let us rewrite it in another form , which allows us to understand more clearly the meaning of each term of the sum .",
    "using well known formulas like @xmath151 one can show , that ( we omit simple , but lengthy calculations ) @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 ordinary kallen - lehmann representation [ 5][6 ] could be obtained from ( 2.50 ) , by putting @xmath155 .",
    "so only the first term under the sign of the first integral remains . in the general case",
    "there is the similar term in the first integral , which contains @xmath156 .",
    "it describes the contribution of the states with @xmath157 both of this terms are @xmath0- invariant .",
    "further , outside the integral there is a @xmath0-invariant tachyonic contribution , which contains @xmath158 .",
    "finally there is @xmath0- noninvariant contribution , given by the last integral in the formula ( 2.50 ) .",
    "this contribution is nonzero only if @xmath97 .",
    "values of function @xmath159 at @xmath35 are @xmath0- invariant .",
    "we emphasize that the quantities @xmath160 @xmath161 @xmath162 are coupled with each other by the relation ( 2.45 ) , although the difference @xmath163 is absent at @xmath35 in the formula ( 2.50 ) .",
    "if there are no restrictions on the spectrum of 4-momentum operator and the @xmath0- invariance is violated , then it is possible to introduce nonzero local field @xmath5 , annihilating the vacuum state i.e. fulfilling the condition @xmath164 in this case due to ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.7 ) @xmath165 and according to the expression ( 2.48a ) @xmath166 @xmath167 @xmath168 furthermore because of ( 2.45 ) @xmath169 @xmath170    it is easy to see from ( 2.54 ) , that in the case ( 2.51 ) the spectrum of tachyons is continuous for every @xmath171 and @xmath172 and covers all negative real axis @xmath173 .",
    "let us do several remarks .",
    "writing the formula ( 2.38 ) , we assumed , that the function @xmath174 increases at @xmath175 not faster , then @xmath110 where @xmath176 . due to the equality ( 2.36 )",
    "it means , that the difference @xmath177 increases in the limit @xmath175 not faster then @xmath178 .",
    "one could weaken this condition and consider the function @xmath179 instead of @xmath174 , putting on the functions @xmath180 and @xmath181 the requirement to decrease in the limit @xmath182 not slower then @xmath108 and increased in the limit @xmath183 not faster then @xmath110 .",
    "after repeating the calculations performed earlier with the function @xmath181 instead of @xmath174 , we get the following formula which replaces ( 2.43 ) , @xmath184 @xmath185 where @xmath186 is an analogue of @xmath93 . one sees , that in the cases , when properties of the functions @xmath15 and @xmath51 provide the existence of integrals in both formulas ( 2.43 ) and ( 2.56 ) , the following relation is true @xmath187 where @xmath188 is a real constant . using the function @xmath186 instead of the function @xmath93 we get the equality @xmath189 @xmath190 instead of ( 2.45 ) .",
    "so , for the most natural restrictions imposed on the function @xmath93 , which have under absence of massless particles the form @xmath191 @xmath192 this function can be reconstructed from its imaginary part above and below the cut along the positive real axis with some arbitrariness .",
    "this arbitrariness affects the relations like ( 2.45 ) and ( 2.58 ) .",
    "one can easily figure out the most general arbitrariness .",
    "let us assume that the functions @xmath193 and @xmath194 are analytical on the whole complex s - plane , with the exception of the cut at @xmath195 , and that they meet the condition @xmath196 we impose the condition ( 2.60 ) only at @xmath197 , but not at @xmath198 in order to consider specially a possible singularity at @xmath198 .",
    "the function @xmath199 satisfies the equality @xmath200 let us construct the functions @xmath201 because of @xmath202 , one gets @xmath203 and @xmath204 further more due to ( 2.62 ) @xmath205 consequently , at @xmath197 @xmath206 due to this fact the functions @xmath207 are analytical in a whole complex @xmath92 - plane probably with the exception of singularity at @xmath198 . according to ( 2.61 ) , ( 2.63 )",
    "@xmath208 due to analytical properties of functions @xmath209 under the conditions ( 2.59 ) , imposed on both quantities @xmath210 and @xmath211 , there is only one possibility @xmath212 we have already met this arbitrariness earlier ( formula ( 2.57 ) ) .",
    "so , under conditions ( 2.59 ) the formula ( 2.69 ) describes all the arbitrariness of restored function @xmath93 .",
    "further we shall be primarily interested in the case of the field @xmath213 , annihilating the vacuum ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "as already established , this corresponds to the equality @xmath215 .",
    "under such condition the relation ( 2.58 ) can not take place for nonzero functions @xmath15 , as far as all of this functions are nonnegative .",
    "that s why we previously used the formula ( 2.43 ) but not ( 2.56 ) , and we shall follow this assumption below .",
    "let us notice , in connection with this , that , if we included the additional term ( 2.69 ) in the right hand side of the formula ( 2.43 ) , we would not improve the u.v .",
    "behavior of the function @xmath216 , at positive @xmath15 without disturbing a relation like ( 2.45 ) .",
    "let us furthermore notice , that , weakening the condition ( 2.59a ) , one could take into account massless particles , by including into one of the functions @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 an additional term @xmath221 or correspondingly @xmath222 and by using the formula ( 2.56 ) .",
    "the relation ( 2.43 ) in doing so is unapplicable , because of infinity at @xmath175 . as it was just figured out , the formula ( 2.56 ) is incompatible with the condition @xmath215 .",
    "so we see , that the wightman functions of the field @xmath213 annihilating the vacuum are not allowed to contain terms , which correspond to massless particles .",
    "further we assume , that there are no such particles , and then we use the formula ( 2.43 ) and its consequences .",
    "in section 2 the general expression was deduced for the propagator of local scalar field not forced to any restrictions imposed on the spectrum of 4-momentum operator . generally speaking the field",
    "was not supposed to be free . in order to use it further in perturbation theory",
    "we shall construct now a free quantum field such that its propagator coincides with the expression described in section 2 . under the phrase `` construct quantum field ''",
    "we understand introducing the hilbert space of physical states and corresponding operators acting on it .",
    "obviously it suffices to construct free field , whose wightman functions in the momentum representation @xmath30 and @xmath223 coincide with preassigned ones , since the propagator and the commutator in this case , can be restored from wightman functions ( see section 2 ) .",
    "all assumptions and notations in this section are the same as in section 2 , but we assume moreover that only two - point connected green functions of fields under consideration are nonzero . we understand here the term `` free fields '' in this meaning only .",
    "we choose a scheme of quantization which permits to describe fields with different types of 4-momentum spectrum in a unique way .",
    "let us assume in the sake of simplicity that @xmath15 and @xmath51 as functions of @xmath34 with fixed second argument @xmath224 are continuous everywhere probably with the exception of no more than countable set of points and also can have no more than countable set of singularities like @xmath225.- function because of its sign indeterminateness . ] unless otherwise stated the sign of @xmath226 is though here and below to be arbitrary .",
    "the discrete @xmath227-like singularities of @xmath15 ( @xmath51 ) correspond to particles ( antiparticles ) with fixed square of mass .",

    "we shall built this field @xmath213 as a sum with certain coefficients of nonlocal fields with fixed square of mass , and shall quantize the last ones lorentz invariantly in a way which leads to the formulas ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) .    in",
    "the following let the index @xmath286 run through values @xmath287 .",
    "for every @xmath288 let us introduce classical scalar nonhermitian field with fixed square of a mass @xmath289 .",
    "in the same manner we define @xmath290 for every @xmath291 . at this stage",
    "there are no principal differences in a properties of this fields but they will be quantized in a different ways .",
    "let us construct an action of a usual type for each of the fields introduced above @xmath292 where index @xmath293 ranges over @xmath15 , @xmath51 .",
    "as far as each of the fields @xmath294 satisfies the corresponding klein - fock - gordon equation , the following equalities are true @xmath295 @xmath296 in the expressions ( 3.18 ) and ( 3.19 ) the functions @xmath297 and @xmath298 are arbitrary scalar functions defined on @xmath299 and @xmath300 ( depending on the value of the index `` n '' ) .",
    "now let us postulate the following * _ nonstandard _ * recipe of quantization , i.e. rules by which one transforms classical fields , written in the form ( 3.18 ) and ( 3.19 ) into operators acting on hilbert space introduced above .",
    "these operators satisfy commutation relations ( 3.2),(3.3 ) ( or ( 3.13),(3.14),(3.15 ) for discrete mass spectrum .",
    "the rules look as follows : @xmath301 @xmath302 @xmath303 there are similar equalities for the @xmath245 and @xmath304 .",
    "let us notice that quantum fields @xmath305 and ones conjugated with them , do not satisfy locality conditions .",
    "now , using the operators just defined , we construct local field @xmath5 according to the formula : @xmath306 one can built the field @xmath307 in a similar manner .",
    "it is easy to see that our last constructions coincide with formally defined ones by equalities ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) .",
    "let us emphasize that in contrast to usual theory where commutators between creation and annihilation operators follow from canonical commutation relations between generalized coordinates and momenta , in this scheme we deduced them from the requirement of getting the given wightman functions .",
    "the fourier transforms of these functions satisfy all limitations from section 2 and in particular the formula ( 2.45 ) .",
    "finally one gets free local scalar fields defined by ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) and the free hamiltonian equal to @xmath308 from the equality ( 3.6 ) . in the sectors of particles with positive square of mass and positive or negative energy",
    ", this two approaches give the same results .",
    "having such free fields one can introduce an interaction of them with other fields and investigate it in the interaction picture , drawing feynman diagrams .",
    "one of the most interesting applications of local field annihilating the vacuum consists in using it for relativistic generalization of lindblad equation for density matrix @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics this equation has the form [ 7 ] . ]",
    ": @xmath309+\\sum\\limits_n \\lambda_n\\left(2a_n\\rho a^{\\dag}_n -a^{\\dag}_n a_n\\rho-\\rho a^{\\dag}_n a\\right),\\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath310 is usual hamiltonian , @xmath311 are arbitrary operators , @xmath312 are positive constants .      as much as @xmath213 is in the interaction picture with the vacuum @xmath8 , we assume that @xmath330 is the wightman function of the fields @xmath5 and @xmath307 at coinciding arguments . even in the general case considered above in section 2",
    "this is equal to @xmath331 , if it is not identically zero .",
    "the last possibility corresponds to the field annihilating the vacuum .",
    "indeed , according with ( 2.6 ) , ( 2.8 ) , ( 2.16 ) @xmath332 one sees by going to the hyperbolic coordinates that this expression is proportional to the infinite volume of the hyperboloid @xmath333 , or correspondingly @xmath334 , unless @xmath335 .",
    "let us also notice that the mentioned divergence is the divergence of probability but not of probability amplitude .",
    "so due to positivity condition we are not allowed to subtract any counterterms to renormalize it .",
    "the considered problem was discussed by pearl [ 2 ] , who suggested to refuse local commutativity of the field @xmath213 and consequently to renounce the proof of lorentz invariance using an equation like ( 4.2 ) . under this conditions",
    "the lorentz invariance must be proved directly by passage from one lorentz frame to another .",
    "but even in this case it appears to be necessary to introduce tachyonic field .",
    "the described above problem of u.v .",
    "divergence connected with an equation like ( 4.2 ) , does not arise , if the field @xmath5 annihilates the vacuum state , i.e. if @xmath215 .",
    "if simultaneously @xmath325 , then due to the equation ( 4.2 ) the vacuum state @xmath336 will not change with the course of time at all .",
    "consequently this is the only possibility , accordant with the local field theory .",
    "this possibility should be investigated .",
    "as found out above the field @xmath5 annihilating the vacuum can exist only in a theory with continuous tachyonic spectrum .",
    "if under absence of lindblad- terms ( i.e at @xmath337 ) this field is free , then it belongs to the class of generalized free fields and its pure tachyonic part describes `` unparticle matter '' .",
    "the existence of such field might be assumed without contradiction with experimental data supposing only , that it interacts with other matter very weakly .",
    "just the possibility to apply such a field in relativistic lindblad equation impelled the authors to undertake the present investigation . to make a theory with the field @xmath213 practically useful one has to introduce very weak interaction of this field with usual matter .",
    "as it will be figured out below we meet very hard difficulties on this way and so far we did not remove them . now let us describe this problem .",
    "consider now a practically important case when the system described by lindblad equation ( 4.2 ) contains ordinary fields interacting with the field @xmath213 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that there is only one ordinary hermitian scalar field @xmath26 with the mass @xmath262 , @xmath338 .",
    "the hamiltonian density @xmath339 in the lindblad equation ( 4.2 ) describes the interaction between the fields @xmath5 , @xmath307 and @xmath26 only .",
    "all the fields are thought in the interaction picture .",
    "before the interaction is taken into account the following formula holds @xmath340 let us require that the interaction does not destroy the property ( 1 ) of the vacuum state .",
    "this means that the vacuum in the @xmath1 picture coincides with the one in the interaction picture .",
    "it leads to the condition @xmath341 without this requirement it is impossible to introduce a pure state which is stable in time and fulfills the lindblad equation , i.e. it is impossible to define the vacuum state correctly for this equation .",
    "the simplest density of interaction hamiltonian , fulfilling the condition ( 5.2 ) looks like this @xmath342 all operators written here and below are in the interaction picture .",
    "one can develop invariant perturbation theory and draw feynman diagrams for this theory .",
    "free propagator @xmath343 of the field @xmath5 in the momentum representation is defined by the formula ( 2.53 ) .",
    "we shall represent it on diagrams by an arrowed line ( because @xmath213 is nonhermitian ) .",
    "the propagator of the field @xmath26 equals to @xmath344 we shall represent it on diagrams using wavy line . let us show that this theory is nonrenormalizeble . consider the diagram with 5 tales shown in fig 1 .",
    "we shall show in a moment that although the difference between momentum degrees in the numerator and in the denominator is negative , this diagram has u.v . divergence .",
    "the last fact is closely connected with special analytical structure of the @xmath213 field propagator .",
    "let us beforehand notice that the divergence of such diagram leads to nonrenormalizability of considered theory . really , the presence of this divergence forces us to introduce a vertex of 5-th degree in fields during renormalization : @xmath345 it is easy to see that canonical dimensions of the fields @xmath213 and @xmath346 are equal to @xmath347 ( see the expressions for the propagators ) , and hence the canonical dimension of the @xmath348 is @xmath349 .",
    "therefore the theory is nonrenormalizable .",
    "indeed , in this case there is a new divergence connected with 7- tale diagram shown in fig 2 .",
    "consequently one needs to introduce an additional term @xmath350 in the @xmath351 .",
    "but this leads to a new divergence ( see fig 3 ) and so on .",
    "finally we conclude that our theory is nonrenormalizable .",
    "so let us now return to the diagram in fig 1 . at first , we shall consider a special case of the ( 2.53 ) for which @xmath352 so one should calculate the following integral @xmath353 from the formula ( 2.53 ) one sees , that the propagator @xmath354 as a function of @xmath36 at fixed @xmath257 , has two branch points at @xmath355 and two poles in the points @xmath356 .",
    "due to presence of `` @xmath357 '' in the denominator and under the sign of the square root , the contour of integration by @xmath36 passes above this singularities in complex plane of the variable @xmath36 . in turn , the singularities by @xmath36 of the @xmath346 field propagator are passed over by the contour of integration in the following manner : @xmath358 - from below , and @xmath359 - from above .",
    "this implies that in contrast with the ordinary theory we are not allowed to make `` euclidian rotation '' in the complex plane of the variable @xmath36 . on the other hand",
    ", we can perform the integration over @xmath36 using the theorem of residues , by closing path of integration around the upper complex semiplane .",
    "so , the quantity ( 4 ) turns into @xmath360 let us consider the behavior of the expression under integral sign in the ( 5.5 ) at @xmath361 .",
    "there are 4 propagators @xmath354 in the fig 1 ; let us number them in the following way : the momentum @xmath362 flows through the propagator of number @xmath286 . from the equality ( 2.53 ) and our additional assumption ( 5.3 ) one can see that anyway at @xmath363 , the @xmath286-th propagator @xmath364 decreases not faster than @xmath365 , when @xmath366 .",
    "so , their product decreases not faster than @xmath367 and the expression under integral sign as a whole - not faster than @xmath368 , hence the integral diverges .",
    "we would get the same result , if we consider a case when @xmath369 . presenting nonnegative continuous functions @xmath370 in the form @xmath371",
    ", we make sure that the most general expression ( 2.53 ) does not make the situation better .",
    "let us notice that similar result takes place if we use arbitrary scalar field considered in the section 2 and nonannihilating vacuum as the field @xmath346 .",
    "really , the propagator of just considered ordinary field @xmath346 can be written in the form ( compare with ( 2.48a ) ) : @xmath372 in a discourse made above only the second term of the last expression contributed to our diagram ( as integration contour passed above both singularities of the first term ) .",
    "if we consider the similar diagram taking the expression @xmath373 as a wavy line , then the result will be obviously the same .",
    "meanwhile , it is easy to see that the sign of @xmath36 and the sign of @xmath226 are not important for our discourse i.e. if we calculate diagram shown in fig 1 and use the expression @xmath374 at arbitrary sign of @xmath226 as wavy line , it still diverges .",
    "finally let us look at the formula ( 2.48 a ) .",
    "only the second term `` @xmath375 '' ( compare with ( 5.6 ) ) gives contribution to the diagram similar to the one , presented in fig 1 .",
    "let us present @xmath51 in the form : @xmath376 @xmath377 where @xmath378 .",
    "one can see that u.v .",
    "divergence , similar to that one described above , takes places every time with the exception of the case @xmath215 that corresponds to the field @xmath346 annihilating the vacuum .",
    "so we conclude that under condition ( 5.2 ) the field @xmath5 is not able to interact with the ordinary fields in renormalizable way .",
    "if we took vector or spinor field as a field of matter and made discourse like one written above , we would have the same result .",
    "moreover , if we try to introduce the interaction between matter fields and the field @xmath213 not directly but through other local scalar fields of a general form described in the section 2 , we have nonrenormalizability again .",
    "everywhere above we required that the interaction of the field @xmath213 , subordinated to the condition @xmath379 , with other fields does not disturb the stability of the vacuum @xmath8 .",
    "as a matter of principle it is possible that this stability is only approximate but the rebuilding of the vacuum flows extremely slowly .",
    "then one may assume that at the birth of the universe , the vacuum fulfilled the condition @xmath379 and it did not change significantly till nowadays .",
    "we did not investigate this possibility in full scale , but after consideration of several variants we found out that the rebuilding of the vacuum in these examples is infinitely rapid .      as a result of our investigation the generalization of kallen - lehmann representation for the propagator of local scalar field with arbitrary spectrum of 4-momentum operator",
    "is established . under this conditions",
    "the @xmath380 violation becomes possible .",
    "the 4-momentum spectrum of @xmath380violating field is not arbitrary but obeys the relation like ( 2.45 ) which follows from the locality condition .",
    "furthermore the tachyons with discrete mass spectrum are not allowed to violate @xmath380invariance .",
    "it is found out that at this assumption and under @xmath0- violation nonzero local field annihilating the vacuum state can exist .",
    "such field is composite : it may have terms which correspond to positive square of mass and positive or negative sign of energy , but it must contain _ continues _ tachyonic spectrum of mass .    using such field",
    "we succeeded to write a correct ( in particular without u.v .",
    "divergences ) local relativistic generalization of lindblad equation for statistical operator in the case of no interaction with other fields .",
    "it turned out that for the simplest interaction of described field with ordinary ones , the theory becomes nonrenormalizable .",
    "we investigated other simple examples of interaction of local tachyonic and phantomic fields ( in particular , nonannihilating the vacuum ) with ordinary ones .",
    "these examples , not described in this work , also did not lead to renormalizable theories .",
    "such results are closely connected with the general form of propagator ( 2.50 ) and with impossibility to make `` euclidian rotation '' .    in the light of the consideration made above , the question arises , whether the local tachyonic and phantomic fields can interact in a renormalizable way with the ordinary fields at all . in the case of positive answer only , the @xmath0- noninvariant local fields can interact with ordinary fields in a renormalizable theory . at the present time",
