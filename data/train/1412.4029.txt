    "different phases are distinguished by local order parameters .",
    "it has come to be realized in the past few decades , however , that there are phases which can not be characterized by local order parameters but are nevertheless nontrivial . dubbed topologically ordered phases , they have in recent years become an intensively studied subject in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "there are largely two known types of topological orders .",
    "one is characterized by states with long - range entanglement that sustain anyonic excitations .",
    "the other arises in states with short - range entanglement and become robust as a phase when some specific symmetries are imposed ; the imposed symmetry condition forbids perturbative terms , whose incorporation would otherwise smoothly deform the state into a direct product ( i.e. , topologically trivial ) state .",
    "states characterized by the latter type of order are said to belong to a symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) phase .",

    "fig : haldanevbs ] ] .",
    "haldane conjectured that heisenberg antiferromagnets composed of integer spin have a nonzero excitation gap , while those with half - integer spin are gapless .",
    "decades after this prediction was verified through many numerical calculations and experiments  @xcite , recent studies motivated by the quest for new topological phases of matter have made it apparent that even within the gapped ground states for integer spin systems , there is a qualitative difference between the @xmath6 odd and even cases .",
    "for example , in the @xmath5 case , it was shown that a phase transition must always intervene between the haldane phase and a topologically trivial phase ( a typical example of the latter being the large-@xmath4 phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : haldanevbs ] ] , which can be expressed in the @xmath7 basis as @xmath8 ) provided one of the following three symmetries is imposed onto the system  @xcite : ( i ) the dihedral group of @xmath9 rotations about the @xmath10 axes , ( ii ) time - reversal , and ( iii ) link - center inversion . for @xmath11 chains , in contrast , it is possible to connect the haldane and large-@xmath4 phases adiabatically  @xcite .",
    "phases in one - dimensional gapped spin chains can thus be enriched by symmetry protection  @xcite and their classification using group cohomology has been put forth  @xcite .",
    "spt phases in higher dimensions have also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "gapped phases are also observed in antiferromagnets under an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "these are the magnetization plateaus , i.e. , the regions within the magnetization curve where the magnetization remains unchanged with increasing field strength .",
    "the oshikawa - yamanaka - affleck ( oya ) theory generalizes the celebrated lieb - schultz - mattis theorem  @xcite and summarizes the necessary condition for the appearance of a plateau in the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of sites in one unit cell and @xmath1 is the spin quantum number and @xmath2 the magnetization per site  @xcite .",
    "the stability of this gapped plateau phase has also be explained in terms of an effective field theory where berry phase terms play a crucial role  @xcite .",
    "strong analogies between the haldane gap and magnetization plateau states have been noted early on  @xcite , and a vbs picture similar to fig .  [",

    ", it would thus seem important to search for magnetization plateau states which can be characterized as an spt phase .",
    "this is the principal purpose of the present work .",
    "we note that there are several previous studies on magnetization plateaus which have also been conducted in the light of topological phases ( though the explicit connection with spt phases was not addressed ) : for instance , the chern number and nontrivial edge excitations associated with plateau state in periodically modulated chains was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the entanglement spectra of plateau states which occur in ferro - ferro - antiferromagnetic ( ffaf ) chains was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an additional motivation comes from the correspondence  @xcite between antiferromagnets subjected to a magnetic field and bosons with a tunable chemical potential ( which can be casted into a bose - hubbard model  @xcite ) .",
    "spt states which appear in the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model have been proposed  @xcite , and new developments in cold - atom experiments enable one to directly measure string orders  @xcite which , in principle , detect the subtle topological orders which characterize such states .",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by developing in sec .",
    "[ sec : effectivefieldtheory ] an effective field theory for magnetization plateau states .",
    "in particular , we elicit a spin berry phase term which will be central to the discussion that follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : temporaledge ] .",
    "this term has a surface contribution which was not considered in the earlier field theoretical work described in ref .",
    "we then go on to investigate , following the path integral formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite , the topological structure of the ground state wave functional of our spin system . here",
    "we will see that the surface berry phase term will contribute a phase factor to the wave functional through the presence of a _ temporal surface term _ ,",
    "i.e. , a temporal analog of the boundary berry phase  @xcite which represents the fractional spins which appear at the end of open spin chains .",
    "we show that this factor will govern whether or not the ground state belongs to an spt phase .",
    "our finding is that a plateau state can be in an spt phase if @xmath3 is an odd integer .",
    "we also make clear that this spt phase is protected by the link - center inversion ( parity ) symmetry @xmath14 by demonstrating that the protection of this phase is broken with the presence of staggered magnetic field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we verify affirmatively this prediction by presenting numerical calculations for model spin systems giving rise to plateaus satisfying @xmath0 odd and @xmath0 even .",

    "@xcite in regard to the magnetization and hence @xmath29 for a given value of the magnetic field as fixed , taking into account the massive nature of the fluctuation of the latter quantity .",
    "the effective action for ( [ eq : hamil ] ) can be divided into the kinetic term @xmath30 and the berry phase contribution @xmath31 , @xmath32 the continuum limit of the kinetic term is  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 the berry phase part of the action ( [ eq : effectiveaction ] ) is the summation of the contribution from each site . for the sake of the following discussion , it proves convenient to introduce an auxiliary vector @xmath35 we note that the spin berry phase term for @xmath36 coincides with that for @xmath37 .",

    "meanwhile , for @xmath18 , it was found that this term does not affect the low - energy physics , allowing for vortex proliferation and hence the formation of a gapped ( i.e. , the magnetization plateau ) state . as we are focused on the latter situation",

    "we now turn to the first term of the last line of ( [ eq : totalberryphase ] ) , which was previously not considered . by placing the system on a space - time grid , the summation over spin berry phases with an alternating sign can conveniently be converted into a net space - time vorticity  @xcite as schematically shown in fig .

    "it is well known that the o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath49 ( nl@xmath49 ) model with a topological @xmath50 term captures the low - energy property of an antiferromagnetic spin chain .",
    "one way to incorporate the planar nature of the order parameter into this action while preserving the global topological properties of the theory , is to employ the cp@xmath51 representation  @xcite , which re - expresses the planar unit vector @xmath52 in terms of a spinor field @xmath53 through the relation @xmath54 ( @xmath55 : pauli matrices ) .",

    "at each site , the dynamics of the polarized portion of the spin moment ( of magnitude @xmath2 ) is pinned down by the magnetic field , while the subsystem consisting of the remaining `` active '' moment of magnitude @xmath3 form a vbs - like state .",
    "the low - energy physics of this state is therefore essentially that of ( the planar limit of ) a haldane gap state of a spin @xmath3 antiferromagnet ( recall that we are confining our attention to the case where @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that the berry phase action , eq .",

    "we discuss how the application of a duality transformation on the effective action obtained above : @xmath63 will enable us to seek additional insight from the viewpoint of vortex condensates . since ( i ) the action ( [ eq : plateaueffaction ] ) is basically a quantum xy model , and ( ii ) vortex proliferation is allowed in the magnetization plateau phase , it is not difficult to guess that the dual vortex - field theory will come out as some variant of the quantum sine - gordon action , a fact which will be verified shortly . though the technicalities involved in carrying out the `` dual - izing '' procedure were described in some details in ref .",

    "following a summary of what has been achieved thus far , we conclude by making several clarifying remarks on loose ends , and putting the work in context with related developments .",
    "we began by deriving a semiclassical effective field theory which describes a magnetization plateau state .",
    "the action obtained was that of an xy model equipped with a topological term associated with space - time vortex events . employing a path - integral formalism",
    ", we found that the latter term governs the structure of the ground state wave functional , and induces a topological distinction between plateau states with even and odd values of @xmath3 .",
    "the source of this distinction may be tracked down to the fact that at the level of the original lattice model , only one in every two spatial links contributed to the total berry phase , which in the continuum limit resulted in a crucial factor of 1/2 .",
    "we further observed that an addition of a staggered magnetic field , which breaks the link - center inversion symmetry enjoyed by the original theory , destructs this topological distinction .",
    "a dual vortex field theory was derived which showed explicitly that with this perturbation the two previously distinct wave functionals could be smoothly deformed into each other without closing the energy gap .",
    "we were thus led to conclude that the @xmath88 odd case is an spt protected by link - center inversion symmetry , while the @xmath88 even case is topologically trivial .",
    "an independent support for this expectation was provided through numerical calculations for @xmath145 and @xmath5 ffaf chains , as well as a rigorous treatment which incorporates an mps representation of the magnetization plateau state .",
    "readers may find it puzzling that we had started out with a lattice model which is identical to the one studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and yet we arrived at a different final expression for the topological term , which was crucial for what followed .",
    "the difference appeared from our adaption of the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite originally devised for treating antiferromagnetic spin chains in the xy limit ( and in the absence of a magnetic field ) and retaining the surface contribution that inevitably arises once we employ this setup .",
    "we also took advantage of the fact that the bulk contribution to the berry phase , being trivial in a magnetization plateau state , could safely be discarded . in short , the difference in outcome between the two treatments stems from the fact that in the present work we made use of a mathematical procedure which picks up the correct surface contributions to the spin berry phases . apart from the presence / absence of these surface terms , the two theories are equivalent .",
    "our treatment of the ground state wave functional basically extends the prescriptions of ref .",
    "@xcite to ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , in their investigation of spt states arising out of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional o(5 ) nl@xmath49 model , needed to employ a limit in which the magnitude of one of the five components of their unit - length field was sent to zero .",
    "this intermediate step was necessary to derive a wave functional whose structure is governed by a topological obstruction at the ( temporal ) surface ; in terms of the integer - valued winding number @xmath214 associated with this obstruction the ground state wave functional can take the nontrivial form @xmath215 .",
    "carrying out the corresponding procedure in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions requires that we start with an o(3 ) nl@xmath49 model and subsequently ( i.e. , after having expressed the wave functional in path - integral form ) reduce the number of components to two .",
    "while this step of reducing the number of components appears somewhat artificial from a physical point of view , it arises naturally for our setup thanks to the presence of the external magnetic field which effectively kills the spin dynamics in the direction parallel to the applied field . in this regard",
    "the magnetization plateau phase in spin chains provides us with an ideal physical stage for studying possible spt states along the ideas of ref .",

    "[ fig : intermediated ] ] , while the haldane and large-@xmath4 phases are connected within the phase diagram  @xcite .",
