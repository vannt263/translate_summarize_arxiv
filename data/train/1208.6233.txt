    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their parent galaxies co - evolve @xcite .",
    "in particular , observational and theoretical work has established a link between accreting smbhs ( active galactic nuclei , or agn ) and host galaxy star formation .",
    "common mechanisms have been proposed for triggering star formation while fueling smbh accretion , including galaxy mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and secular processes involving gravitational instabilities induced by spiral arms or galactic sized bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "disentangling star formation from agn activity becomes a necessary endeavor to investigate smbh and host galaxy co - evolution .",
    "this separation has been explored extensively and has included identifiying optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) spectral signatures of starburst activity in agn @xcite , performing principal component analysis on infrared spectra of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and analyzing optical and infrared ( ir ) diagnostics that parameterize the relative contribution of agn to star formation , such as ratios of infrared and optical emission lines that indicate ionization field hardness @xcite and strength of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features @xcite . here",
    "we extend the study of the interplay between agn activity and star formation to the x - ray regime .",
    "quiescent galaxies emit thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "hot gas energized by stellar winds and supernova explosions radiates in soft x - rays ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) whereas x - ray binares and supernova remnants dominate the non - thermal emission above 2 kev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "due to the relatively short life time of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs , @xmath4 yr ) and the short delay between starburst and generation of soft x - rays from hot gas , hard and soft x - ray emission can trace the instantaneous star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "indeed , x - ray emission from quiescent galaxies is well correlated with radio , infrared , optical and ultraviolet sfr indicators ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "various x - ray sfrs have thus been calibrated in the literature based on the correlation of x - ray emission with far - infrared and radio luminosities @xcite , x - ray emission from hmxbs and cumulative galactic x - ray point sources with far - infrared luminosities @xcite and x - ray luminosity with infrared plus ultraviolet emission @xcite .",
    "however , low mass x - ray binaries , which trace stellar mass ( m@xmath5 ) rather than star formation , also contributes to the x - ray emission and becomes the primary source of x - ray radiation in galaxies with low sfr / m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "an active nucleus complicates using x - ray emission as a sfr indicator : accretion onto the smbh dominates emission above 2 kev . isolating the hard x - ray emission due to star formation then becomes prohibitively difficult when the nucleus is not resolved . however , soft x - ray emission can have comparable contributions from scattered / reflected agn emission and thermal emission from gas associated with starburst activity when the agn is obscured or has very low luminosity . determining the relative contribution of agn and star formation to the soft x - ray emission can be achieved through high resolution spectroscopy which resolves narrow emission lines .",
    "various diagnostics can be used to distinguish between collisionally and photoionized plasma , such as the width of the radiative recombination continua @xcite and ratios of forbidden , intercombination and resonance lines in the ovii triplet @xcite . however , with current x - ray missions ( i.e. _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) high resolution spectra are only obtainable through grating observations , necessitating long exposure times on x - ray bright sources to achieve adequate signal to noise .",
    "how well can less time - intensive low resolution ccd spectroscopy achieve the goal of disentangling starburst from agn activity in soft x - rays ?",
    "local obscured agn , seyfert 2 galaxies ( sy2s ) , provide an ideal laboratory to answer this question .",
    "as these sources are relatively nearby and the accretion disk is hidden behind an obscuring `` torus , '' circumnuclear starbursts are visible . hence , both agn and host galaxy star formation can be modeled .",
    "levenson et al . ( 2004 , 2005 ) analyzed _ chandra _ observations of two sy2/starburst composites ( ngc 5135 and ngc 7130 ) and demonstrated that a thermal component due to stellar processes was necessary to adequately model the soft x - ray emission .",
    "we expand this methodology to sy2s in general to investigate the efficacy of modeling soft x - ray emission with a thermal component to describe host galaxy star formation .",
    "our analysis focuses on two samples of sy2s : an optically selected [ oiii]5007  sample @xcite and a mid - infrared selected 12@xmath3 m sample @xcite . using _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations , we decomposed the soft x - ray emission into a star - forming and an agn component",
    ". for sy2s observed with _",
    "chandra _ that have significant host galaxy emission , we are able to resolve the point source associated with the agn and can therefore remove it and analyze emission soley from the host galaxy , which we ascribe to star formation ( l@xmath1 ) . for",
    "the sy2s observed with _ xmm - newton _ and the remaining _ chandra _ sources , we fit the x - ray spectra with a combination of a thermal and power - law model . to account for the presence of x - ray binaries , we scale the soft thermal and power law fluxes using star - forming galaxies from the xsings sample as a template ( ptak et al . 2012 ) , obtaining soft x - ray luminosity values associated with star formation ( l@xmath1 ) and agn activity ( l@xmath0 ) .",
    "we compare these estimates of l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 with infrared ( ir ) spectral signatures that accurately describe star formation ( [ neii]12.8@xmath3 m luminosity , l@xmath6}$ ] , @xcite and agn activity ( [ oiv]26@xmath3 m luminosity , l@xmath7}$ ] , @xcite to test the accuracy of this decomposition .",

    "twenty - eight of these sources have archival _ chandra _ and/or _ xmm - newton _ data .",

    "we imposed a lower column density ( n@xmath12 ) limit of that due to our galaxy along the line of sight to the source . in some cases ,",

    "the photon indices were tied together , with the normalizations left free to vary and an independent absorption attenuating the second power law component ( n@xmath13 ) ; the sy2s best accommodated with a single power law can be identified by the blank entry in the n@xmath13 column of tables [ o3_apec ] and [ 12m_apec ] . the lower temperature limit ( kt ) was set at 0.1 kev .",

    "this result indicates the presence of a two temperature gas , similar to the results of x - ray observations of starburst galaxies @xcite : one phase at kt between 0.6 - 0.75 kev and a lower temperature gas at @xmath140.15 kev , with the exception of m-3 - 34 - 64 which has two hot gas components at 0.77@xmath15 kev and 2.85@xmath16 .",
    "we list the observed soft fluxes in tables [ o3_flux ] and [ 12m_flux ] : total 0.5 - 2 kev flux ( f@xmath17 ) , power law component of soft x - ray flux ( f@xmath18 ) and apec component of soft x - ray flux ( f@xmath19 ) . in the subsequent analysis",
    ", we omit the sy2s with a poorly costrained apec flux , i.e. the sources where the error is an order of magnitude or more higher or lower than the measured value ( 2masx j11110693 + 0228477 and cgcg 242 - 028 ) , leaving us with 35 sy2s .",
    "before assigning `` thermal '' ( f@xmath19 ) flux to starburst activity and power law emission ( f@xmath18 ) to agn , we need to account for the effects of x - ray binaries which contribute to the non - thermal emission .",
    "as noted above , high mass x - ray binaries indicate instantaneous star formation in the host galaxy and this effect is incorporated into x - ray sfr calibrations .",
    "since x - ray binaries boost the non - thermal flux , f@xmath18 will overestimate the agn emission while f@xmath19 under - represents host galaxy star formation . to assess the contribution of x - ray binaries to the observable emission , we model just the extended emission when the agn is resolvable . for the remaining sources , we apply a correction to f@xmath19 and f@xmath18 using results of x - ray analysis of star - forming galaxies from the xsings sample ( ptak et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "spatially resolved emission from the narrow line region ( nlr ) can also potentially affect the results , over - predicting the luminosity attributable to host galaxy star formation .",
    "for a handful of 12@xmath3 m sources , the major radius ( @xmath20 ) of the nlr was measured from @xcite , while we used the relations from @xcite to estimate nlr @xmath20 values for the remaining 12@xmath3 m sources and the [ oiii ] sample .",
    "for the [ oiii ] sy2s , the nlr radius ranges from 280 - 900 pc , with a median size of @xmath140.5 kpc .",
    "similarly , the 12@xmath3 m selected sy2s have nlr sizes ranging from 80 - 1320 pc , with a median @xmath20 value of @xmath140.39 kpc .",
    "for all [ oiii ] and a majority of 12@xmath3 m sources , the nlr is an order of magnitude or more smaller than the x - ray extraction radius .",
    "the nlr is thus likely not resolvable at these scales , so we only focus on quantifying the effects of x - ray binaries on the observed emission .",
    "one notable exception is ic 5063 , where the radius of the nlr ( @xmath141.3 kpc ) comprises a signficant fraction of the x - ray extraction radius ( 3 kpc ) .",
    "we will return to this sy2 in section [ results ] .",
    "another potential bias could be due to photoionized gas from the nlr being indistinguishable from collisionally ionized gas at low ccd resolution .",
    "however as we show in section [ results ] , such an effect does not systematically affect our results .",
    "due to _ chandra _ s arc second resolution and the close proximity of the 12@xmath3 m sy2s , the central point source ( i.e. agn ) is resolvable for a subset of our sample . to accurately constrain the agn position , we ran wavedetect on 2 - 10 kev _ chandra _ images of the 12@xmath3 m sample .",
    "spectra were then extracted from the remaining emission , omitting the agn identified by wavedetect .",
    "similar to above , the broad band x - ray emission was fitted with ( an ) absorbed power law(s ) and an apec component .",
    "we only include those sources where the spectra from the residual emission have a high enough signal - to - noise to be fit with the @xmath21 statistic ( minimum grouping of 10 counts per bin ) , therefore dropping the sources where the x - ray emission is concentrated in the nucleus : ngc 424 , tololo 1238 - 364 , f05189 - 2524 and ngc 5347 .",
    "the summary of the spectral fitting for these 11 sources is listed in table [ pt_src_rem ] , and the associated total soft x - ray flux from the unresoloved emission ( i.e. host galaxy emission after agn removal ) is listed in the second column of table [ 12m_flux ] . to first order , the total soft x - ray flux from the unresolved emission can be considered an estimate of host galaxy star formation , l@xmath1 .",
    "l@xmath0 is then estimated by taking the difference between l@xmath1 and l@xmath17 for these sy2s , with the associated error derived by scaling the error of total soft x - ray luminosity by the ratio of the agn luminosity to the total luminosity .",
    "we have used the results of xsings to estimate the contribution of x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) to the soft x - ray emission in host galaxies .",
    "the xsings project entails the analysis of 96 chandra observations of 56 spitzer infrared nearby galaxy survey ( sings ) galaxies ( kennicutt et al , 2003 ) .",
    "sings is designed to cover a wide range of galaxy properties such as morphological type , star formation rate ( sfr ) , stellar mass and metallicity , and the main aim of xsings is to study the relationships between x - ray emission ( x - ray binaries , nuclear activity and hot ism ) with these properties . in ptak",
    "et al . ( 2012 , in prep . ) the spatially - averaged x - ray emission of xsings galaxies is discussed and compared to the summed x - ray binary luminosities for galaxies with significant detections ( x - ray binary catalogs for all xsings galaxies will be presented in jenkins et al .",
    "xrbs emit as a power law , but provide a measure of the instantaneous sfr along with thermal emission in soft x - rays .",
    "we therefore have : @xmath22 @xmath23    we further assume that a certain fraction of x - ray emission from xrbs contributes to host galaxy star formation : @xmath24    using the 22 pure star - forming galaxies in xsings ( i.e. non sy2s and non liners ) , we have calculated the mean ratio of x - ray emission from resolved non - nuclear point sources ( i.e. x - ray binaries ) to total x - ray emission in the 0.5 - 2 kev band ( @xmath25 ) , deriving @xmath26 . solving the above equations , we obtain : @xmath27 @xmath28    to account for uncertainties in the luminosities derived from spectral fitting ( i.e. l@xmath19 and l@xmath18 ) and the wide spread in @xmath25 values",
    ", we have performed monte carlo simulations to derive l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 .",
    "we have drawn 1000 random values for l@xmath19 , l@xmath18 and @xmath25 from a gaussian distribution centered on the best - fit values of l@xmath19 and l@xmath18 ( and mean value of @xmath25 ) , with @xmath2 corresponding to the errors derived from spectral fitting ( and standard deviation on @xmath25 ) . using these simulated parameters and eqs . 4 and 5 , we calculated 1000 simulated values for l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 .",
    "the mode of these distributions is then taken as l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 , with the 68% confidence interval as the associated errors .",

    ", we use a bayesian approach to linear regression @xcite . both here and in section",
    "[ results ] , the high and low error bars on the x - ray flux were averaged to provide symmetric errors for the linear regression routine .",
    "we plot l@xmath31 as a function of l@xmath29 and l@xmath32 against l@xmath30 in figure [ chandra_v_sings ] .",
    "the grey shaded regions enclosed by the dashed lines delineate the 3@xmath2 confidence level on the regression line , based on the median of the posterior distribution of the slope , intercept and mean distribution of the independent variable , with the dotted - dashed line denoting the line of equality .",
    "though the l@xmath31 values are somewhat systematically higher than l@xmath29 , they do agree within the 3@xmath2 contours .",
    "the agreeement among these independent methods suggests that using xsings galaxies as a template to correct the l@xmath19 and l@xmath18 values for the presence of x - ray binaries provides a reasonable estimate to decompose the soft x - ray emission in the absence of resolveable nuclear emission .    in the subsequent analysis ( i.e. section [ results ] ) , we use l@xmath29 and l@xmath30 as l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 for the 11 _ chandra _ sources with high signal - to - noise . l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 for the remaining 24 sy2s",
    "are estimated via the monte carlo simulations outlined above .",
    "these values are listed in tables [ o3_lum ] and [ 12m_lum ] for the [ oiii ] and 12@xmath3 m samples , respectively .",
    "we compare our x - ray decomposition with information gleaned from high resolution infrared spectroscopy , using diagnostics that cleanly trace the separate processes of agn and star formation activity .",
    "the flux of the [ oiv]26@xmath3 m line has been shown to accurately describe intrinsic agn flux @xcite while the [ neii]12.8@xmath3 m emission reliably tracks star formation in both quiescent and active systems ( lamassa et al . , 2012 ) .",

    "figure [ softx_ne2_o4 ] illustrates the results of this decomposition .",
    "we consider the x - ray variable sy2s , ngc 5506 and ngc 7172 as independent data points , but we do average the soft x - ray flux for the latter two ngc 5506 observations , which are consistent . though we have only one ir measurement for each of these sources , we do not expect the infrared emission to vary as much as the x - ray emission .",
    "we color code the sources in figure [ softx_ne2_o4 ] according to sample : cyan triangles represent the 12@xmath3 m sy2s ( with the x - ray variable sources connected by a vertical line ) , blue diamonds denote the subset of 12@xmath3 m sources with high signal - to - noise _ chandra _ imaging of the unresolved emission and red squares mark the [ oiii ] selected sources .",
    "the overplotted line indicates where the two quantities are equal . with the exception of a handful of outliers , a relatively good agreement is present between the observed soft x - ray emission and the ir decomposition .",
    "we note that this consistency holds for both the 12@xmath3 m and [ oiii ] samples , with no apparent systematic offset introduced from different sample selection techniques . in the following analysis",

    "we note that the abscissa errors are on the order of the symbol size , due to the 5@xmath2 detection limit we imposed on ir detections ( see lamassa et al .",
    "2012 ) , and therefore are not plotted in figure [ lx_ir ] , though they are included in the errors for the bayesian linear regression routine .",
    "due to the large error on l@xmath0 for ngc 7674 , this source was dropped from the l@xmath0 vs. @xmath34 l@xmath7}$ ] analysis .    in figure [ lx_ir ] ,",
    "a dotted - dashed line is plotted to indicate where the two quantities are equal while the grey shaded region illustrates the 3@xmath2 confidence interval on the regression line . l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 are approximately equivalent to @xmath33 l@xmath6}$ ] and @xmath34 l@xmath7}$ ] , respectively , albeit with wide scatter for a handful of individual sources .",
    "deviations of the regression fit from equality at greater than the 3@xmath2 level are slight , and appear at higher luminosities for the star formation decomposition ( @xmath36 erg / s/@xmath37 ) and moderate luminosities for the agn parameterization ( @xmath38 l@xmath39 erg / s/@xmath37 ) .",
    "as mentioned previously , the nlr for ic 5063 takes up a signficant fraction of the the x - ray extraction region , where contributions from resolved nlr emission could potentially bias the x - ray estimate of host galaxy star formation .",
    "however , as seen in figure [ lx_ir ] , where ic 5068 is the blue diamond at @xmath33 l@xmath6}$ ] = 40.4 dex and l@xmath1 = 40.1 dex , this source lies well within the shaded region .",
    "hence nlr contamination appears to be negligible , possibly due to the removal of the agn from the _ chandra _ imaging analysis .",
    "we note that aperture bias can contribute to these slight disagreements : [ neii ] ( [ oiv ] ) is measured through the short - high ( long - high ) module on the irs spectrograph on _ spitzer _ , corresponding to sizes 4.7@xmath4011.3 ",
    "( 11.1@xmath4022.3  ) , whereas the x - ray apertures capture the full emission from the host galaxy ( see tables [ o3_ap ] and [ 12m_ap ] ) .",
    "hence , biases can be introduced from comparing parameters that sample different physical scales of the host galaxy , introducing scatter into the relation . in the agn parameterization , there are 4 obvious outliers from the relation : ic 0486 and mrk 463 ( members of the [ oiii ] sample with over - predicted l@xmath0 , red squares in figure [ lx_ir ] ) , ngc 4388 ( from the 12@xmath3 m sample with under - predicted l@xmath0 , blue diamond in figure [ lx_ir ] ) and ngc 5506 ( from the 12@xmath3 m sample with over - predicted l@xmath0 , an x - ray variable source with a vertical line connecting the cyan triangles in [ lx_ir ] ) .",
    "interestingly , there are no correlations between outliers in the l@xmath0 parameterization and physical size of x - ray emitting region ( where mis - match beween aperture sizes between _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ and _ spitzer _ could introduce disagreements ) , quality of soft x - ray spectra , sample selection , source variability or even method for estimating l@xmath0 . in general , however , deviations of the best - fit trends between l@xmath1 versus @xmath33 l@xmath6}$ ] and l@xmath0 versus @xmath34 l@xmath7}$ ] from equality at the 3@xmath2 level are slight .",
    "such an agreement demonstrates that our method of using low resolution ccd spectroscopy to decompose the soft x - ray emission into a star - forming and an agn component is moderately successful , with greater consistency in the star formation estimation .",
    "l@xmath1 can then be used to estimate the host galaxy sfr in sy2s using the l@xmath17 calibrations from @xcite and @xcite .      for the 12@xmath3 m sample",
    ", we have tested the efficacy of our decomposition by deriving a soft x - ray sfr using the @xcite calibration and comparing this with the far - infrared ( fir ) sfr using the @xcite calibration , using iras flux densities reported in @xcite .",
    "the [ oiii ] sample , however , lacks a reliable independent host - galaxy wide sfr .",
    "these sources were not detected by _",
    "iras _ and the sdss sfrs derived through the 3  fiber ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion ) only covers the innermost regions of the galaxy , while the x - ray aperture captures the full emission .",
    "we therefore use only the 12@xmath3 m sample to test the x - ray derived sfrs .    to estimate sfr@xmath41 , we used the sum of 60@xmath3 m and 100@xmath3 m _ iras _ flux densities .",
    "we note that the @xcite calibration is based on mir through fir luminosities for starburst galaxies , and in such systems , including the iras 12@xmath3 m and 25@xmath3 m luminosities as part of the fir luminosity is important",
    ". however , these mir luminosities have significant contributions from dust heated by the agn , so we only consider the 60@xmath3 m and 100@xmath3 m luminosities when deriving sfr@xmath41 , which are less contaminated by the agn . as shown in figure [ firsfr_xsfr ] , a good agreement exists between sfr@xmath17 and sfr@xmath41 , despite the latter sfr parameterization being most appropriate for starburst galaxies .",
    "this agreement suggests that any unresolved photoionized emission from the nlr does not introduce any systematic offsets into our results , but rather operates at a level less than the observed scatter .",
    "the 2 sy2s that are the greatest outliers ( i.e. , largest sfr@xmath41 values ) are arp 220 and f05189 - 2524 , which are ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "we have modeled the 0.5 - 10 kev spectra of two homogeneous samples of seyfert 2 galaxies to disentangle the starburst and agn emission in soft x - rays ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) .",
    "eleven of these sy2s , observed with _",
    ", had high signal - to - noise unresolved emission after removing the agn .",
    "we derive l@xmath1 from spectrally fitting this unresolved emission and assign l@xmath0 to the difference between the total soft x - ray emission and l@xmath1 .",
    "the remaining 24 sources were decomposed into an agn and star formation component by modeling the soft x - ray emission with a power law and thermal model .",
    "the luminosities of these sources were converted to l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 values based on a scaling factor derived from xsings analysis on normal star forming galaxies . to account for errors on the luminosities",
    "derived from spectral fits and the scaling factor , we executed monte carlo simulations , assuming a gaussian distribution of random variables centered on the best - fit values of l@xmath19 , l@xmath18 and @xmath25 , with the spread corresponding to the errors on these parameters . using eqs . 4 and 5",
    ", we calculate l@xmath1 and l@xmath0 from the 1000 simulated parameters and use the mode of this distribution as our estimate of the x - ray luminosities due to star formation and agn activity .      * the soft x - ray spectra of 10 sy2s were well fitted by two thermal model components , indicating the presence of a two temperature gas .",
    "this result is similar to what has been observed in starbust galaxies @xcite .",
    "* for the subset of 11 sy2s with high signal - to - noise _ chandra _ imaging of unresolved host galaxy emission , estimates of the soft x - ray emission due to star formation and agn from both _",
    "imaging analysis and estimates from the monte carlo simulations agree at the 3@xmath2 level . in the absence of resolved nuclear emission ,",
    "scaling l@xmath18 and l@xmath42 by the factors derived from xsings analysis is thus a reasonable method to estimate the agn and star formation contributions to the soft x - ray emission . *",
    "the independent decompositions of the soft x - ray luminosity into a star formation and agn component using ir data as a proxy and scaling l@xmath19 and l@xmath18 based on xsings galaxies largely agree within a 3@xmath2 confidence interval .",
    "deviations of the best fit regression line from this agreement are slight and appear at higher luminosities ( @xmath43 erg / s/@xmath37 ) in the star formation decomposition and at moderate luminosities ( @xmath38 l@xmath44 erg / s/@xmath37 ) when describing agn emission .",
    "though more scatter in individual sources is evident in the agn decomposition , the star formation relationship is more consistent among both methods .",
    "* comparison of our calculated x - ray sfr using the @xcite calibration with an fir derived sfr from @xcite for the 12@xmath3 m sample shows general agreement .",
    "we have demonstrated that analysis of low resolution ccd x - ray spectra can effectively disentangle emission from agn activity and star formation in 0.5 - 2kev x - rays . using the decomposition we have presented , l@xmath1 can be used to cleanly estimate the sfr in sy2s using existing calibrations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , complementing previous studies in the optical and infrared and providing a more panchromatic view of the interplay between smbh accretion and star formation .",
