    "over the last four decades , the physics of particle scattering from different kinds of black holes was one of the most active topics of strong gravitational fields . apart from the quasinormal modes which , in principle , can be identified as the poles of the corresponding black hole scattering matrix , the behaviour of the cross section with respect to the scattering angle is one of the most interesting features in this area . the key issues around which the physics of black hole scattering centers are related to phenomena such as glory , orbiting ( or spiralling ) , rainbow and super - radiant scattering .",
    "one should note that these features are observed experimentally and studied extensively theoretically in nucleus - nucleus scattering .",
    "it is gratifying to see similar phenomena occurring in black hole scattering @xcite . in the pioneering papers of ford and wheeler @xcite ,",
    "using semi - classical arguments , a connection between the classical rainbow , glory and orbiting phenomena was made with their quantum mechanical counterparts .",
    "starting with a procedure as proposed by mott and massey @xcite which gave the classical cross section @xmath3 , the authors noticed that the classical deflection function can be written in terms of the quantum mechanical scattering phase shift as @xmath4/dl$ ] , where @xmath5 is the angular momentum and @xmath6 the impact parameter .",
    "for particles scattered into the solid angle @xmath7 , the cross sectional area can be written as , @xmath8 , so that the differential cross section is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the classical angular momentum is @xmath10 .",
    "going over to the quantum mechanical case , if we now consider the de broglie wavelength @xmath11 of the particle to be small compared to the range of the force , we may write , @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , while working with semi - classical approximations such as the wkb , one must replace @xmath13 . in the article of ford and wheeler",
    ", the authors thus obtain the differential cross section proportional to @xmath14 , which is divergent when the scattering angle @xmath15 is @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "glory is characterized by @xmath18 passing with finite slope through @xmath19 etc and rainbow by the maxima or minima in @xmath18 .",
    "if the deflection function displays a singularity at a certain critical value @xmath1 of @xmath5 , they show that @xmath18 will vary logarithmically near @xmath20 . for values of @xmath5 below and above @xmath1 the particle would have spiralling trajectories and @xmath20 would give the limit of an unstable circular orbit .",
    "for a particle incident with energy @xmath21 and for an effective potential , @xmath22 , which is the sum of an actual interaction potential and a centrifugal term , the condition corresponding to such an orbit was shown to be @xmath23 ( which as we shall see later is @xmath24 for massless particles with @xmath25 ) , where @xmath26 is the position of the maximum of the effective potential and @xmath21 the available energy .",
    "quantum mechanically , one does not get divergent cross sections .",
    "one rather observes peaks in the cross sections as a function of angle in the backward directions for glory and orbiting scattering .",
    "based on the works of ford and wheeler , the characterization of the above phenomena in black hole scattering is mostly done in literature by noting the behaviour of the real part of the scattering phase shift or by looking at the oscillating patterns in the cross sections at backward angles . in the present work , we relate the phenomenon of orbiting scattering to the imaginary part of the scattering phase shift .",
    "to be specific we evaluate the reflection coefficient in black hole scattering from schwarzschild black holes by solving the corresponding riccati equation numerically . finding a sudden rise of the reflection coefficient",
    ", @xmath27 plotted as a function of @xmath5 , at a certain critical value of @xmath5 for different energies and different spins ( @xmath28 ) of the massless scattering particles , we show that this critical @xmath5 is nothing but the @xmath1 corresponding to the unstable circular orbit .",
    "we also find that the normalized @xmath0 always passes through a value of @xmath29 at the critical value @xmath1 .",
    "the present work differs from others @xcite in view of the points mentioned above .",
    "the reflection coefficient is evaluated exactly using the variable amplitude method as compared to approximate calculations ( third reference in @xcite ) , @xcite .",
    "we also find a potential proportional to @xmath30 which gives remarkably good results when compared with the numerical ones .",
    "for this potential the transmission coefficients can be found analytically .",
    "parametrizing the @xmath31 potential to fit the regge - wheeler potential , we find semi - analytical results for black hole scattering .",
    "even though the scattering off black holes is a widely explored area , not much attention has been paid to the orbiting phenomenon ( mostly the glory and rainbow effects have been discussed ) . here",
    "we supplement the existing literature by a detailed study of how the existence of a classical orbit gets reflected in the quantum mechanical expressions of the scattering of a massless particle from a black hole .",
    "this leads to a conjecture regarding quantum corrections to the classical effective potential for massless particles .    in the next section",
    ", we provide briefly the formalism for black hole scattering in general and go on to discuss the critical parameters relevant to orbiting and glory scattering . in section iii , we discuss the calculation of the reflection coefficient and present results regarding its connection to orbiting scattering .",
    "we also present a conjecture related to these phenomena . in section",
    "iv we discuss how the regge - wheeler potential can be re - interpreted as an effective potential plus quantum corrections proportional @xmath32 . in section",
    "v we summarize our findings .",
    "we start by presenting some generalities in black hole scattering . consider the propagation of a massless scalar field @xmath33 governed by the wave equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes a static , spherically symmetric black hole metric whose line element is @xmath36 using the following ansatz @xmath37 it is standard @xcite to reduce the above equation to a schrdinger - like equation for the radial part @xmath38\\psi_{n \\ell \\omega } = \\omega^2\\psi_{n \\ell \\omega } , \\ ] ] where in principle @xmath39 , but we shall drop the subscript for convenience in what follows .",
    "moreover , @xmath40 ( with the form of @xmath41 depending on the metric under consideration ) and @xmath42 here , a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath43 whereas @xmath44 is a tortoise coordinate defined through @xmath45      in case of the schwarzschild metric which we shall consider in the present work , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mass of the black hole and the tortoise coordinate is given by @xmath48 eq .",
    "( [ radial ] ) can also be obtained for other spins .",
    "the corresponding regge - wheeler potential for spins @xmath28 is given as @xcite @xmath49\\ ] ] where , @xmath50 .",
    "note that as we move from @xmath51 at the event horizon to @xmath52 , the tortoise coordinate varies from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "since the scattering problem with the radial coordinate @xmath43 in three dimensions ( 3d ) gets mapped into a one - dimensional ( 1d ) one with the @xmath55 coordinate , the schrdinger - like equation ( [ radial ] ) in black hole scattering can be solved using standard techniques for 1d tunneling in quantum mechanics .",
    "the asymptotic solutions of the schrdinger equation ( [ radial ] ) are @xmath56 @xmath57 for waves incident on the black hole from the right ( i.e. @xmath58 ) we have @xmath59 , the reflection amplitude @xmath60 and the transmission amplitude @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 @xmath63      an anomalous large angle scattering , called alas , was observed often in nuclear reactions between @xmath64-like nuclei such as @xmath65c-@xmath66o , @xmath66o-@xmath67si etc @xcite and has been attributed to the orbiting mechanism in scattering .",
    "the origin of this mechanism can be traced back to classical dynamics , where a particle approaching the potential center can get trapped in a circular orbit of radius @xmath68 if its energy equals the maximum of the effective potential at @xmath68 .",
    "ford and wheeler @xcite found the connection of this phenomenon with the classical deflection function which becomes singular at a critical value of the angular momentum for which the circular orbit can exist and leads to divergent cross sections .",
    "the analogous effect in quantum mechanical scattering corresponds to the appearance of a diffraction pattern ( or peaks ) in the scattering cross section in the backward direction .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that as long as the classical deflection function @xmath18 remains between @xmath16 and @xmath69 , the semi - classical cross section can be entirely described by the classical cross section .",
    "if the deflection function passes smoothly through @xmath16 or @xmath69 , it leads to the phenomenon named glory .",
    "though classically it corresponds to a singularity in the cross section , quantum mechanically one expects only a prominent peak in the cross section .",
    "ford and wheeler related the deflection function to the real part of the quantum mechanical scattering phase shift .",
    "detailed discussions on the topic can be found in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we directly state their conclusion , namely , @xmath70 connecting the deflection function with the real part of the phase shift . there exists a critical value @xmath71 corresponding to backward glory scattering . the deflection function at backward angles can be approximated as @xmath72 orbiting occurs when the effective potential as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath43 possesses for some angular momentum @xmath1 , a relative maximum equal to the available energy .    for massive particles in classical general relativity ( gr )",
    "this means @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath22 enters the geodesic equation in the form @xmath74 . for massless particles ,",
    "the same condition with @xmath22 from the geodesic equation of motion is @xmath75 with @xmath76 where @xmath77 has the dimension of angular momentum per mass which makes @xmath22 dimensionless . replacing @xmath78 by @xmath79 we return back to the quantum mechanical picture .",
    "note that part of @xmath80 ( i.e. the first term of v(r ) in ( [ blackpot ] ) ) is proportional to @xmath22 and in the case of @xmath81 , the entire @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "we shall come back to this point later .",
    "under such a condition , the deflection function was shown to vary logarithmically @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath6 are constants .",
    "the particle is expected to spiral below or above the barrier depending on the value of @xmath5 being greater or less than @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath20 , the particle is trapped in a circular orbit and @xmath18 is singular . with @xmath18 being related to the real phase shift as in ( [ deflphase ] )",
    ", one expects a steep jump down in the real part of the phase shift at the critical value of @xmath5 .      in black hole scattering with @xmath86 , eq .",
    "( [ blackpot ] ) is proportional to the classical @xmath22 from general relativity .",
    "here one expects an unstable photon orbit at @xmath87 .",
    "considering the potential @xmath88 with the semi - classical prescription of @xmath89 , it is easy to see that the critical value of the angular momentum @xmath5 is given by @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "if one uses @xmath92 instead , one of course ends up with a quadratic equation for @xmath1 .",
    "the two values of @xmath1 should however be quite close for large values of @xmath5 .",
    "one could try to find the critical @xmath1 for the occurrence of circular orbits in the scattering of spin 0 and 2 particles in the same way too . considering @xmath93 in ( [ blackpot ] ) at @xmath94",
    "leads to @xmath95 in the semi - classical approximation and @xmath96 quantum mechanically . in table",
    "i we list the two sets of @xmath1 for different values of @xmath97 .",
    "as expected , the difference between the semi - classical @xmath98 and @xmath99 is little for large values of @xmath5 .",

    "what appears at a first glance as a curious coincidence will be explained in the next section by analyzing the form of @xmath93 .    in what follows",
    ", we shall present an exact numerical calculation of the reflection coefficient and study its behaviour as a function of @xmath5 in context with orbiting scattering .",
    "in this section we will compare and discuss three different methods to calculate the reflection coefficient : a semi - analytical result , numerical results using the variable amplitude method and the approximation of a rectangular barrier adjusted to the problem of black hole scattering .",
    "we will see that the semi - analytical result gives a very good overall description of the problem .",
    "the reflection amplitude in black hole scattering has also been calculated in literature @xcite using semi - classical approximations .      before we go over to the details of the calculations of the reflection coefficient ,",
    "let us briefly examine the nature of the potential in black hole scattering and what results one can expect .",
    "the potential in the schwarzschild case as given in eq.([blackpot ] ) is made up of two functions , namely , @xmath104 ( see eq .",
    "( [ blackpotur ] ) ) and @xmath41 , such that @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath104 consists of a @xmath5 dependent term which resembles the centrifugal barrier in standard problems in quantum mechanics .",
    "the form of @xmath41 depends on the metric under consideration . in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the potential as a function of the coordinate @xmath43 as well as @xmath55 and note the following features + ( i ) the potential looks very different when taken as a function of @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "+ ( ii ) if we plot the function @xmath104 only , the steep rise of the centrifugal barrier is evident , however , only when plotted as a function of @xmath43 and not @xmath55 .",
    "+ ( iii ) due to the presence of @xmath41 , the potential plotted as a function of @xmath55 resembles a gaussian barrier and the centrifugal term is not explicitly seen in the shape of the potential . however , as evident from fig.2 the height of the potential rises with @xmath5 . +     the schwarzschild black hole potential for spin @xmath106 and @xmath107 . ( a ) potential plotted as a function of the dimensionless coordinate @xmath108 and ( b ) @xmath109 , where @xmath55 is the tortoise coordinate and @xmath68 the schwarzschild radius.,width=264,height=377 ]     the regge - wheeler potential compared with the @xmath31 potential from equation ( [ cosh2 ] ) for different spins and angular momentum .",
    "the discrepancy between the two cases is more prominent at smaller energies where the regge - wheeler potential displays an asymmetric tail .",
    "notice also that increasing @xmath5 results in an increasing height.,width=340,height=302 ]    new insights can be often gained by searching for analytical and semi - analytical results . to this end",
    "we notice that the reflection coefficients for the potential @xmath110 ( or modification of the above by a shift of the argument ) can be obtained analytically ( we refer the reader for details to @xcite ) .",
    "the relevance of this potential to our problem is its similarity to the regge - wheeler potential in the tortoise coordinate .",
    "indeed , @xmath111 fits the regge - wheeler potential quite well for @xmath112 provided we choose @xmath113 , @xmath114 and the height @xmath115 to be the regge - wheeler potential at @xmath116 , i.e. , @xmath117 which is different for different choices of @xmath118 and @xmath5-dependent .",
    "for instance , in the cases @xmath112 we obtain @xmath119\\ , , \\quad s = 0\\\\ \\nonumber r_0 ^ 2v_0=\\frac{4}{27 } 4l(l+1 ) \\",

    ", \\quad s = 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the comparison between the regge - wheeler and the parametrized @xmath31 potential is shown in fig.2 .",
    "evidently , one would expect some quantitative agreement in both cases for the reflection coefficient for tunneling at higher energies , i.e. , where the two potentials almost overlap .",
    "we will see that this is indeed the case . to be able to use the analytical results from @xcite we use : @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this gives the following transmission coefficients : @xmath123 if @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "the pschl - teller potential defined in equations ( [ cosh1 ] ) and ( [ cosh2 ] ) has been used to extract quasi - normal modes of black holes , either as an approximation @xcite or in obtaining exact results in the nariai spacetime @xcite for which the scalar field equation reduces to the radial equation with the pschl - teller potential .      in @xcite handler and matzner used a rectangular barrier as an approximate solution to obtain the transmission coefficients corresponding to the black hole scattering problem of spin 1 particles .",
    "their choice of the height of the barrier is @xmath115 with the same definition as explained above .",
    "the width @xmath6 is energy and @xmath5 dependent : @xmath127 .",
    "the standard analytical results for the rectangular barrier read for @xmath128 @xmath129 . for @xmath130",
    "one obtains @xmath131 .",
    "notice that with this prescription one can not calculate @xmath132 for @xmath133 which as far as the results of handler and matzner are concerned is a valid assumption as they restrained themselves to @xmath86 and therefore via @xmath50 to @xmath134 .      in this section",
    ", @xmath135 will be evaluated numerically via the variable amplitude method .",
    "the variable amplitude method was first introduced in @xcite and has been widely used to evaluate the reflection and transmission coefficients for different potentials in literature @xcite .",
    "this method involves writing the solution of the schrdinger equation as a superposition of the reflected and transmitted waves , namely , @xmath136 $ ] , which leads to the following equation for @xmath137 @xmath138 ^ 2 .\\ ] ] the absence of reflection behind the potential at @xmath139 imposes the boundary condition @xmath140 on the above equation .",
    "the reflection coefficient is given by @xmath141 .",
    "when we calculate the reflection coefficient , we expect it to be large and close to unity for energies much below the height of the barrier ( where transmission is a quantum mechanical possibility and hence very small ) . since transmission increases with energy , the reflection coefficient falls and at high energies ( above the barrier ) where transmission becomes the classical phenomenon and reflection a quantum mechanical effect , the reflection coefficient is negligibly small . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the reflection coefficient as a function of energy for black hole scattering . on the left",
    "is shown the exact numerical result using the regge - wheeler potential and on the right the reflection coefficient evaluated from the expressions for @xmath142 discussed in the previous sections for a rectangular barrier and parametrized @xmath31 potential ( which is similar in shape to a gaussian barrier @xcite ) .",
    "reflection coefficient as a function of energy for @xmath100 and for different values of @xmath5 in black hole scattering . on the left we plot the numerical results and on the right the reflection coefficient for an adjusted rectangular barrier ( see text ) of height @xmath115 ( dashed line ) and for the parametrized @xmath31 potential ( solid line ) . since the results for the latter almost coincide with the numerical ones we plot them in two different boxes.,width=491,height=264 ]    in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the results in two separate boxes since the numerical results would almost overlap with the results obtained from the @xmath31 potential .",
    "this agreement is remarkable .",
    "in contrast to that , the results obtained via the rectangular potential differ from the exact ( numerical ) results .",
    "reflection coefficient or the scattering amplitude squared as a function of @xmath5 for the scattering of massless scalar ( @xmath106 ) , electromagnetic ( @xmath81 ) and gravitational ( @xmath143 ) waves from a black hole .",
    "for comparison we plot also for @xmath144 the results obtained from the parametrized @xmath31 potential .",
    "as expected the agreement with numerical results improves with energy . for @xmath86 the same comparison",
    "is done in the next figure . for @xmath100 , we just mention that here the agreement between the numerical and the semi - analytical results is the best among the three cases.,width=491,height=415 ]    in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the numerically evaluated reflection coefficient as function of @xmath5 for different values of @xmath97 and for different spins of the scattering particles .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath0 goes through a sudden rise at the critical values of @xmath5 listed in the tables and connected to the orbiting phenomenon .",
    "the fact that the reflection coefficient for a given energy rises as a function of @xmath5 can be understood by examining the plot of the potential for different @xmath5 values at the same energy . in fig .",
    "2 , we see that the effect of increasing @xmath5 is to increase the height of the barrier . hence , for example , an energy close to the top of the barrier for @xmath145 will lead to little reflection but at the same energy , the barrier for @xmath146 is much higher leading to larger reflection .",
    "for @xmath144 we made a comparison with the corresponding @xmath31 potential .",
    "for small energies , the agreement is still not perfect , but improves rapidly with growing energies as is evident from the plots .",
    "this behaviour is to be expected since the regge - wheeler potential differs from the fitted @xmath31 case if the energy of the particle is much below the height of the potential where the regge - wheeler displays an asymmetric tail .",
    "this small mismatch between the the results obtained from the two potentials should be also present for the cases @xmath147 , but will not be so prominent as for @xmath144 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath0 for @xmath147 saturates at smaller value of @xmath5 . as a result",
    "the difference between the small energy and the height is less then in the case @xmath144 where the saturation sets in at higher @xmath5 . indeed , as one can infer from fig .",

    "comparison of the reflection coefficients calculated using numerical methods , the adjusted rectangular barrier and the parametrized @xmath31 potential as a function of @xmath5 for the case @xmath81 .",
    "evidently the rectangular barrier ( dash - dotted ) is not a good approximation whereas the @xmath31 ( dashed lines ) gives a very good agreement with exact numerical results ( solid lines).,width=491,height=415 ]    an approximate calculation of the magnitude of the reflection amplitude was done in the third reference in @xcite ( article by handler and matzner ) . for the case of @xmath81 ,",
    "the authors approximated the potential by a rectangular barrier as explained before in the text and studied the features of the corresponding reflection amplitude as a function of the angular momentum @xmath5 .",
    "the magnitude of the reflection amplitude for the various values of @xmath97 studied here , started saturating to unity at a certain value of @xmath5 which the authors referred to as @xmath71 , the critical value for the onset of glory scattering .",
    "it also showed a sudden rise through @xmath29 as a function of @xmath5 ( this @xmath5 value however is different for the rectangular and realistic regge - wheeler case ) .",
    "however , no interpretation was attempted to explain this fact .",
    "indeed , here we have clearly connected it to the orbiting effects .",
    "the findings in @xcite are not similar to those of the present work for the case @xmath148",
    ". a closer look at fig .",
    "5 reveals the differences between the exact results and the results from a rectangular barrier . not only is the shape of the reflection coefficients different , but also the values at which the reflection coefficient makes a jump and at which it saturates to unity .",
    "a possible explanation for @xmath149 as seen in figs 4 and 5 for the numerical results can be found by examining the approximate expression of the reflection coefficient as obtained in the wkb approximation @xcite . in case of barrier penetration ,",
    "when the energy @xmath150 of the incident particle lies below the top of the barrier , the semi - classical reflection coefficient is given as @xmath151 with @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the classical turning points .",
    "for very small values of @xmath150 , @xmath0 approaches unity . however , when @xmath150 equals the maximum height of the barrier , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "thus one can relate the orbiting phenomenon with a critical @xmath5 value @xmath1 such that @xmath149 .",
    "finally an interesting observation in connection with the orbiting is that the reflection coefficient which characterizes the critical value @xmath1 is related to the imaginary part of the scattering phase shift .",
    "if one relates the reflection amplitude to the @xmath158 matrix in three dimensional ( 3d ) scattering , one can write @xmath159 , where @xmath160 in general , is the complex scattering phase shift .",
    "thus , @xmath161 , where , @xmath162 is known as the inelasticity parameter which can be less than or equal to 1 . in the 1-dimensional case , the @xmath158 matrix is a @xmath163 matrix with two channels , namely , transmission and reflection such that @xmath164 .",
    "if @xmath165 , it implies that @xmath166 and there exists complete reflection .",
    "however , @xmath167 corresponds to the existence of the transmission channel .",
    "the reflection coefficient @xmath168 , i.e. , @xmath169 and is related only to the imaginary part of the phase shift .",
    "the sudden rise in @xmath170 at @xmath1 corresponds to a peak in @xmath171 , where @xmath172 this should be contrasted with the semi - classical characterization in eq .",
    "( [ deflphase ] ) where the orbiting and glory parameters are characterized using the real part of the scattering phase shifts .",
    "this is also due to the fact that the scattering phase shifts calculated within the semi - classical approaches such as the wkb are always real . using an exact numerical evaluation of @xmath0 here",
    ", we find a connection of the orbiting parameters with the imaginary part of the phase shift .",
    "for @xmath81 ( @xmath173 ) , @xmath26 obtained from ( [ veffgeo ] ) agrees with the quantum mechanical calculation via @xmath174 ( corresponding to the jump in @xmath0 ) .",
    "the same would be true for @xmath175 if @xmath26 is computed through eq.([veffgeo ] ) , replacing therein @xmath22 by @xmath80 .",
    "the argument for @xmath175 , namely , that @xmath1 is connected to the classical unstable circular orbit , can be now maintained if we attempt a reinterpretation of @xmath80 .",
    "restoring @xmath32 in our expressions amounts to replacing @xmath176 by @xmath177 or equivalently @xmath178 by @xmath179 .",

    "it is reasonable to speculate that @xmath185 represents the full effective potential , i.e. , the classical part plus @xmath186 quantum mechanical corrections .",
    "indeed , @xmath185 would then be the correct tool to calculate a classical unstable orbit .",
    "recently , @xmath32 corrections to the newtonian potential , have been discussed in @xcite , where it was found that the additional terms are proportional to @xmath187 ( @xmath188 is the restored newtonian constant ) .",
    "the procedure to arrive at such a result is to consider non - relativistic amplitudes with zero and higher order loop corrections .",
    "the difference from our case is that these corrections were calculated for massive particles where the newtonian potential exists and the non - relativistic limit makes sense . in a massless case , such a procedure is not well - defined .",
    "therefore our conjecture is well motivated but remains open .",
    "since the dimensions of @xmath22 from gr and @xmath189 are different , let us be more specific . to make @xmath185 dimensionless we divide it by the planck mass squared , @xmath190 and identify @xmath191 .",
    "thus , @xmath192\\ , .\\ ] ] our speculation is simply to say that @xmath22 receives a small quantum correction proportional to @xmath32 in the above equation .",
    "this explains also the coincidences found in the previous section .",
    "indeed , calculating @xmath26 from @xmath22 or @xmath22 plus quantum corrections will give very similar results .",
    "therefore it is not a surprise that @xmath99 comes out quite close to the @xmath1 evaluated from @xmath26 .",
    "the behaviour of the reflection coefficient , @xmath0 , which enters the scattering cross sections is investigated for the scattering of scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational waves from a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we paid special attention to the issue of orbiting effects in a quantum mechanical scattering off black holes .",
    "our investigation displays the following features :    * for @xmath193 we found that @xmath0 jumps at a certain critical value @xmath1 , i.e. its second derivative with respect to @xmath5 is zero .",
    "the regge - wheeler potential is proportional to the classical effective potential for @xmath86 only .",
    "we find that @xmath1 is connected with the unstable circular orbit at @xmath87 for @xmath86 .",
    "* we find the @xmath1 values for @xmath175 , too . here",
    "also we would expect that the critical value @xmath1 is connected to an unstable circular orbit at a critical @xmath26 .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath1 values calculated using @xmath194 lie very close to those using @xmath195 .",
    "this can be explained if we re - interpret the regge wheeler potential as the classical effective potential with @xmath32 corrections .",
    "notice that with the values of @xmath1 obtained via the rectangular potential , such a conclusion would be impossible as the jump occurs at a different @xmath1 and the connection to the unstable circular orbit is lost .",
    "* for all values of @xmath97 and spins @xmath196 and @xmath197 we find that @xmath149 .",
    "* we have shown that the transmission and reflection coefficients of the potential proportional to @xmath30 ( pschl - teller ) match very well with the exact results . since for this particular case",
    "the transmission coefficient can be given analytically , this allows us to study the black hole scattering in a semi - analytical way and supplements the conclusion that such a potential is a good approximate tool in black hole physics @xcite .",
    "both the semi - analytical results and the numerical ones refine approximate results obtained elsewhere and reveal some deficiencies of the approximation methods .",
