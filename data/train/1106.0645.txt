    "the present cosmological observational estimations indicate that @xmath2 of the matter in the universe is composed of exotic components which do not emit any kind of electromagnetic radiation in contrast to the ordinary forms of matter known in the laboratory . for this reason",
    ", these exotic components have been denoted the dark components of the universe .",
    "ordinarily , these dark components are divided into two different ones : dark matter , exhibiting zero effective pressure , and directly connected with the formation of structure in the universe ; dark energy , exhibiting negative pressure , responsible for the current stage of accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "there are many candidates to represent dark matter ( axions , neutralinos , etc . ) and dark energy ( cosmological constant , quintessence , etc . ) , all of them with important advantages and disadvantages . since both components are detected only indirectly , through their gravitational effects , it is not excluded that the gravitational phenomena that are interpreted as manifestation of dark matter and dark energy could also be explained by a deviation of the gravitational theory , i.e. , general relativity",
    ". however , such proposal faces many theoretical and conceptual problems ( conflict between local and global properties , etc . ) .",
    "in fact , all attempts to explain dark matter and dark energy may achieve remarkable success but , to our knowledge , all of them must also live with important drawbacks . for recent reviews , see references @xcite .    in the last decade an interesting proposal to describe dark matter and dark energy has arised , the so - called unified model , where dark matter and dark energy are different manifestations of a unique fluid , keeping at same time general relativity framework untouched .",
    "the prototype of these unified models for dark energy and dark matter is the chaplygin gas @xcite , which has been generalized in many different ways @xcite .",
    "@xmath3-essence models@xcite , which are based on modified expression for the scalar field kinetic term , can also unify the dark sector , and",
    "the chaplygin gas is in fact a kind of @xmath3-essence model .",
    "more recently , some special types of self - interacting scalar fields have been used to represent the unified scenario @xcite .",
    "dissipative fluid using the bulk viscous pressure @xcite has also been considered as a possibility of implementing a unified model for the dark sector @xcite , leading to very interesting results @xcite . in the homogeneous and isotropic universe background",
    "a one - component viscous fluid shares the same dynamics as a gcg @xcite .    the unified models for the dark sector have been tested in many different ways , and the conclusion is that they can survive the observational tests , but in some cases specific priors must be introduced in order to avoid tensions among different observational tests .",
    "for example , confronting snia and lss ( large scale structures ) data , for the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model , it seems that the unified model must be imposed from the beginning and the parameter @xmath4 must be restricted to positive values , in order to alleviate the tensions in the parameter estimations .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 must be restricted to positive values , in order to have a non imaginary sound velocity @xcite , a crucial restriction when observational tests based on perturbative analysis are included .",
    "in this paper we will consider the @xmath1 observational data to investigate unified cosmologies using the fluid description for the cosmic components .",
    "our candidates for the unified dark sector will be i ) the generalized chaplygin gas , with equation of state @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath4 are constants and @xmath7 is its density ; ii ) the bulk viscous fluid that is described by the eckart s formula @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fluid expansion and @xmath10 is the coefficient of bulk viscosity , written in terms of the density @xmath11 with constant parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we will not consider , initially , any other observational test , and the reason to concentrate on only one test is to verify to what extend there is potential tensions in the initial proposal of the model ( for example , no need of an extra dark matter component ) .",
    "it is important , in order to have future reliable parameter estimations using all observational tests , to let a given observational test `` to speak freely '' , without further constraints . later , as an application of our analysis , we will make a joint analysis using sn ia , for the gcg model , for the best model obtained from the @xmath1 analysis .",
    "we use only one important restriction : the spatial section will be flat .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : the predictions for a flat universe are quite robust , and this seems to be corroborated by the position of the first accoustic peak in the spectrum of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite ; imposing a flat spatial section , we restrict the space of free parameters , avoiding unnecessary degeneracy as consequence of many free parameters .",
    "our result at the end is very clear : the choice of the priors affects the final parameter estimation of any chaplygin - based cosmology . in particular , concerning the unification program different priors over the parameter @xmath4 can lead us to distinct conclusions . for the viscous model , we obtain estimations for the free parameters of the model , leading to results that are in qualitative agreement with the estimations obtained for the chaplygin gas , but the unification scenario must be imposed from the beginning .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", we describe the models and the @xmath1 observational data . in section iii ,",
    "the gcg model and the viscous model are confronted against the @xmath1 data . in section iv , we present the final conclusions .",
    "the gcg model is characterized by the equation of state ( [ chaplygineos ] ) .",
    "the gcg is a realization of the energy - momentum tensor that appears in the right hand side of the einsteins equations .",
    "the original interest for the chaplygin gas came , from the theoretical side , to its connection to string theory @xcite and , both from the theoretical and observational point of view , from the fact that it can unify dark matter and dark energy , representing both components at same time .",
    "hence , it could seem unreasonable to consider the chaplygin and an extra pressureless component .",
    "but , even in a unified scenario baryons must be present and , moreover , we would like to verify the priors and hypothesis that must be implemented in the model in order to have consistent predictions .    if we add a matter component , which accounts for the baryons and an extra amount of pressureless dark matter , the flat friedmann s equation and the conservation law equations read , @xmath14 @xmath15 the subscripts @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote pressureless baryonic matter , pressureless dark matter and the chaplygin gas , respectively . in this sense , we begin with a three fluid model , where the total pressureless component is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the conservation equations can be integrated leading to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an integration constant .",
    "if we fix the scales such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the present time , * @xmath24 * is the present density for pressureless matter . also , the gcg density can be re - written as @xmath25^\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the gcg density today , and @xmath27 is a parameter connected with the sound velocity of the fluid .",
    "the dimensionless density parameters are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter today .",
    "hence , the friedmann s equation may be written as , @xmath30^\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}.\\ ] ] expressing now the scale factor in terms of the redshift @xmath0 , @xmath31 , we find finally the expression for the function @xmath1 : @xmath32^\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of the reduced hubble parameter @xmath33 via @xmath34 and we have used that @xmath35 . the nucleosynthesis prior @xmath36 will be adopted .    equation ( [ h(z ) ] ) indicates how the hubble parameter varies with the redshift .",
    "this is the quantity that we will be confronted with the observational data .    in order to describe the background dynamics of the bulk viscous fluid we use the equation of state ( [ viscouseos ] ) and we re - write equations ( [ chabackground1 ] ) and ( [ chacont ] ) as @xmath37 @xmath38 remark that the continuity equation for the bulk viscous fluid depends on @xmath39 . in the absence of pressureless matter we have @xmath40 and",
    "the dynamics given by equations ( [ visbackground1]-[viscont ] ) corresponds to the set ( [ chabackground1]-[chacont ] ) if we use the correspondence @xmath41 then , in a one fluid model , the gcg model and the bulk viscous fluid have the same background dynamics .",
    "since pressureless matter was considered in the expansion factor ( [ visbackground1 ] ) the correspondence described above does not occur within the cosmology considered here .",
    "consequently , the background dynamics of the bulk viscous fluid will be different from the gcg model .",
    "the fractional density for the bulk viscous fluid will be given by the numerical solution of the continuity equation @xmath42^{1/2}=0 , \\label{omegarv}\\ ] ] where the new parameter @xmath43 can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 via @xmath44 .",
    "once we have solved the above differential equation for @xmath45 the final background dynamics is @xmath46,\\ ] ] where the relation @xmath47 still applies .",
    "the hubble parameter may be written in terms of the redshift parameter @xmath0 as @xmath48 hence , to determine the function @xmath1 requires the knowledge of the derivative of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be achieved by identifying some `` clock '' galaxies that exhibit a uniform distribution of star population .",
    "special attention is given to red galaxies .",
    "this method has been proposed in @xcite and employed to such galaxies in references @xcite .",
    "we will use the data listed in reference @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the usual @xmath49 statistitics will be used , computing the quantity @xmath50 where the superscripts @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the evaluated theoretical value and its corresponding observational result , while @xmath53 is the observational error bar . from this quantity ,",
    "the probability distribution function @xmath54 is constructed : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a normalization factor .",
    "the probability depends on the free parameters of the theoretical model . for the gcg model ,",
    "these free parameters are @xmath33 , @xmath57 , @xmath4 and @xmath58 . in our subsequent analysis",
    ", we will consider three main cases : the unification scenario , where the @xmath59 contribution is given just for the baryon component @xmath60 ; fixing @xmath61 ( the @xmath62cdm prior ) , where the gcg can be seen mainly as a dark energy candidate ; leaving the parameter @xmath57 as a free parameter . in this way we can consistently test the unification scenario of the gcg model .",
    "choosing a prior is an important part of any bayesian calculation .",
    "this includes to choose conveniently the interval for each free parameter .",
    "concerning the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath63 and @xmath57 the natural choices are @xmath64 the background dynamics of the gcg model has a fundamental dependence on the parameter @xmath4 . in principle",
    ", @xmath4 can assume any arbitrary positive value .",
    "from the perturbative perspective , for example , a positive sound velocity requires @xmath65 .",
    "even very large values , as @xmath66 , have been found in perturbative analysis @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that we do not need to fix an upper limit to @xmath4 . on the other hand , the dynamics that has motivated gcg cosmologies , i.e.",
    ", a matter dominated - like behaviour in the past followed by an accelerated one , occurs only if @xmath67 .",
    "also , some estimations in the range @xmath68 have been found using snia @xcite .",
    "hence , in order to explore different prior choices on @xmath4 , we adopt the general priors @xmath69 , where @xmath70 assumes four different values : -10.0 , -2.0 , -1.0 , 0.0 .",
    "we firstly discuss the results concerning the unification scenario ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the one - dimensional estimations for each free parameter .",
    "the uncertainties are calculated at @xmath72 .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the choice of the priors .",
    "there is a high concordance around the values @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "since the final estimation of any parameter depends only on the prior information of the remaining ones , in principle the estimated value for @xmath4 does not depends on its own prior .",
    "this is a general result in bayesian analysis and is also valid for any other parameter .",
    "but this assertion is true only if the priors do not exclude regions of high probability for the parameter under evaluation . in any case , the uncertainties for the parameter @xmath4 can be different as shown in table 1 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pdf is limited at @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , the area below this function , which is used to calculate the uncertainties , depends on the prior .",
    ".one - dimensional estimations of the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath63 and @xmath4 for the unified gcg scenario ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]          from the analysis done so far using the @xmath1 data it seems that the unification scenario with the prior @xmath76 is the favoured one for chaplygin - type cosmologies . keeping this result in mind ,",
    "we have also fixed the unification case for the bulk viscous fluid above . however , using other cosmological probes we can place stronger constraints on this unification case .",
    "in particular , a joint analysis using also the sypernovae data will provide reliable constraints on the equation of state parameters @xmath4 and @xmath63 . in order to implement the joint analysis for the generalized chaplygin gas we rewrite @xmath77 ( equation 17 ) as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 corresponds to equation ( 16 ) .",
    "the supernovae data set used in our analysis is the union2 @xcite . in figure [ figjoint ]",
    "we assume the unification scenario ( @xmath80 ) and we show the contours for the equation of state parameters using only the supernovae data ( left panel ) and the joint analysis ( right panel ) .",
    "the contours obtained for the joint analysis are wider as the errors added to the likelihood function ( compared to the increase of the total @xmath77 ) become now larger . and @xmath81 data are crossed may indicate a tension between the data even taking into account the priors used . if there is this tension , it is small , and perhaps less important that other controversial aspects of the snia data , like the calibration issues , for example , those coming from the use of salt or mlcs calibration methods ] also , note that the two samples predict a different estimated value for @xmath4 yielding to a larger propagation of the uncertainties . for the joint analysis , we marginalize over the parameter @xmath63 in order to obtain an estimation for @xmath4 and we obtain @xmath82 which agrees ( including the errors ) with the result considering only the h(z ) data .    one important issue concerning parameter estimations for unified models is to discuss the constraints from the cmb physics .",
    "the allowed parameters we have found in this work is an acceptable fit cmb data according to previous estimations @xcite , which predict @xmath83 .",
    "analysis using just the position of the first peak , also favors @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "however , a complete analysis using the cmb data , in the sense of the analysis here developped for the @xmath1 data , presents new challenges .",
    "for example , in the references @xcite , the parameter @xmath4 has been restricted to positive values and only adiabatic perturbations were considered . since the full perturbative analysis , at least at linear level , is necessary in order to obtain the cmb restrictions to gcg model parameters , some aspects already mentioned above point towards the necessity of a deeper analysis : the perturbative estimations for @xmath4 show another peak of probability for very large @xmath4 , either for matter power spectrum @xcite and the integrated sachs wolf effect @xcite , with this new peak located around @xmath84 ; moreover , at perturbative level , the extension of the estimations to negative values of @xmath4 is problematic , due to problems concerning imaginary sound speed .",
    "some proposals to surmount this last difficult have been made in reference @xcite but no clear scenario allowing to consider negative values of @xmath4 has emerged until now .",
    "then even if there is an overall agreement of the estimations made here and previous estimations obtained using cmb , the restrictions on the model parameters are not the same , and a new complete extensive analysis is required .",
    "hence , the addition of other cosmological probes does not provide a substantial change in the final parameter estimation .",
    "the gcg model has four free parameters , when the flatness of the spatial section is imposed . leaving the four parameters free , the unification scenario for dark matter and dark energy",
    "is not favored : the one - dimensional probability distribution for @xmath4 extend to arbitrary negative values ( if @xmath85 ) , and at same time the prevision for @xmath59 becomes similar to the @xmath62cdm model .",
    "in fact , the crossing of these results with the ones comming from the perturbations ( the matter power spectrum ) @xcite , allows to conclude : for any chaplygin - based cosmology if the parameter @xmath59 is free to vary the unification scenario , with @xmath86 , is not favored . however , this problem can be alleviated if the allowed range of the parameter @xmath4 is restricted to @xmath65 . with this choice",
    ", the unification scenario becomes the preferred one ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "remark that this prior is obligatory for the matter power spectrum analysis in order to have real values for the sound speed .",
    "again for the @xmath1 test , fixing @xmath87 , we also find a plateau for negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "this result can be understood by remembering that large negative values of @xmath4 implies a model very similar to the @xmath62cdm one .",
    "the imposition from the beginning of the unification prior ( @xmath88 ) leads to a more consistent scenario , with a peak of probability for @xmath4 near @xmath89 for any choice of @xmath70 .",
    "note that a joint analysis using also supernovae as cosmological probes does not change the main predictions for this case .",
    "this is consistent with the corresponding power spectrum analysis , which implies also a peak of the probability around @xmath89 . in this sense , in order to allow the parameter @xmath4 to assume negative values the prior of the unification scenario seems to be the only consistent one .",
    "the bulk viscous model appears as a second candidate for the unification scenario .",
    "its background dynamics is similar to the gcg one .",
    "however , unlike the gcg , the perturbative analysis of the bulk viscous fluid supports the unification scenario . having in mind the similarities between the bulk viscous model and the gcg one ( section two ) , the constraints obtained in figure [ figviscous ] agrees with the results for the gcg analysed in case ( i ) . due to the fact that the bulk viscous fluid has less pathologies or restrictions than the gcg one it seems put it as a more natural candidate for the unification scheme .",
    "one difficult with such model ( based on the eckart s formula ( [ viscouseos ] ) ) appears when dealing with the integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite .",
    "however , the viscous pressure has an alternative description in terms of the second order corrections to the equilibrium , namely the mueller - israel - stewart theory @xcite .",
    "this approach is very promissing for further investigation .",
