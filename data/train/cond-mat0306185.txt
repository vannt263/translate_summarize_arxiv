    "the symmetry of the order parameter in superconducting sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has been a subject of intense experimental and theoretical interest in recent years@xcite .",
    "it is probably the best candidate , currently , for an odd - parity , spin triplet , superconductor which would be a charged particle analogue of superfluid @xmath11he.@xcite although a number of other superconductors are also possible spin - triplet superconductors ( including upt@xmath12 , uge@xmath0 , zrzn@xmath0 , and bechgaard salts ) strontium ruthenate is probably the one which is best characterized experimentally .",
    "samples can be grown which have exceptionally long mean free paths,@xcite and above @xmath13 the normal state is a fermi liquid with a well understood fermi surface@xcite .",
    "currently controversy exists over two key aspects of the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 pairing state .",
    "firstly , the gap function symmetry is still not known .",
    "rice and sigrist@xcite suggested several possible gap functions for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 corresponding to analogues of superfluid phases of @xmath11he .",
    "of these only the analogue of the anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) state@xcite , @xmath14 is consistent with the observations of a constant @xmath15 plane knight shift@xcite and spin susceptibility@xcite below @xmath13 .",
    "this state is also consistent with the @xmath16-sr experiments which show spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking at @xmath13.@xcite however this gap function has no zeros on the three cylindrical fermi surface sheets@xcite of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , in direct contradiction to several experiments which indicate that the gap function has lines of zeros on the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is not easily resolved since a complete group theoretic classifications of all symmetry distinct pairing states in tetragonal crystals@xcite _ do not include any states _ which have both spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking at @xmath13 and symmetry required line nodes on a cylindrical fermi surface.@xcite a number of _ ` f - wave ' _ gap functions have been proposed@xcite for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an @xmath19 spherical harmonic function .",
    "such gap functions have constant @xmath15 plane knight shift and may have both time reversal symmetry breaking and line nodes , however in tetragonal symmetry crystals they are always either of mixed symmetry ( requiring a double phase transition ) or are in the same symmetry class ( @xmath20 ) as @xmath21 _ ` p - wave ' _ states which do not have line nodes .",
    "such f - wave functions may be possible physically ( depending on the details of the actual pairing interaction ) , but the line nodes are not required by the symmetry of the pairing state .",
    "the second controversy about the sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 gap function concerns the presence of three different fermi surface sheets , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "the _ orbital dependent superconductivity _ model of agterberg , sigirst and rice@xcite envisioned a dominant gap on one part the fermi surface ( originally @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , with the gap function on the other band only arising from interband coupling and hence being significantly smaller .",
    "this theory predicted that weak impurity scattering would destroy the small gap on the inactive sheet , and hence lead to a finite residual density of states at zero energy .",
    "however the experimental specific heat data@xcite shows that @xmath22 is zero at @xmath23 , and hence there is a finite order parameter on all sheets of the fermi surface . in a recent letter , zhitomirsky and rice@xcite",
    "have argued that the gap function of superconducting strontium ruthenate can be described by an effective , k - space , _ interband - proximity effect_. in this model they propose that the superconductivity is due to an attractive interaction in the p - wave channel , which is acting almost entirely on one sheet of the fermi surface , the @xmath6 sheet .",
    "the other two fermi surface sheets , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are driven to become superconducting because of a `` proximity effect '' or josephson like coupling between the @xmath6 and @xmath7,@xmath8 bands .",
    "this model has a number of features which are consistent with the experimental facts , such as the presence of both line - nodes in the gap function and spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking below @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , if the interband josephson coupling energy is chosen to be sufficiently large , then the energy gap at low temperatures is moderately large on all the fermi surface sheets and there is no second peak below @xmath13 in the specific heat capacity .    in a recent paper",
    "we have proposed a quite general semi - phenomenological methodology for studying the possible superconducting states of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . in this approach",
    "one chooses , more or less systematically , orbital and position dependent interaction constants to describe the electron - electron attraction .",
    "the simplest useful model we have studied prominently featured interlayer coupling@xcite .",
    "this model characterizes the pairing interaction in terms of two nearest - neighbor negative-@xmath24 hubbard interactions , one , @xmath25 acts between ru @xmath26 in a single ruo@xmath0 plane , while the second , @xmath27 acts between ru @xmath28 @xmath29 orbitals between planes .",
    "when these two parameters are chosen so as to give a single phase transition temperature at the observed @xmath13 of @xmath30 we find excellent agreement with the measured specific heat , penetration depth and thermal conductivity data .",
    "the gap function has both time reversal symmetry breaking , but also horizontal lines of nodes in the planes @xmath31 on the @xmath8 fermi surface sheet .",
    "the @xmath6 sheet remains node - less , with a gap function of the form @xmath32 , corresponding to the 2-d analogue of the @xmath11he a - phase .",
    "the predicted gap function is similar to that of zhitomirsky and rice ( zr ) @xcite , but differs in that it is more or less same size on all three fermi surface sheets .",
    "moreover , while zr rely on ` proximity coupling ' to avoid the double phase transition we exploit the freedom provided by the experimental data and achieve the same end by fixing both @xmath25 and @xmath27 so that there is only one transition at the observed @xmath33k .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify a number of unresolved questions concerning the _ interlayer coupling _ model .",
    "firstly we show in section iii that the results of the model are quite generic , and do not depend sensitively on the choice of the specific hubbard model parameters which we used in ref.@xcite .",
    "secondly we examine the effects of weak disorder on the gap function ( section iv ) .",
    "we show that weak disorder can suppress any f - wave components of the gap function , while leaving the p - wave order parameter relatively unchanged . finally in section",
    "v we study the generalisation of our model by allowing for a `` bond proximity '' interactions . such symmetry mixing interactions",
    "have been proposed by zhitomirsky and rice@xcite as a mechanism leading to the single superconducting transition temperature .",
    "it turns out that the mechanism operates in the orbital picture as well and we obtained the single superconducting transition temperature , but different slope and jump of the specific heat .",
    "let us begin by reviewing briefly the symmetry principles which are used to classify different pairing symmetry states in odd - parity superconductors .",
    "we shall use these principles to contrast the different pairing states that have been proposed for strontium ruthenate .    on very general ground",
    "we expect that the phase transition into the superconducting state is of second order , and so there exists an order parameter , or set of order parameters , @xmath34 . for superconductors",
    "these order parameters are complex , transforming under the @xmath35 gauge symmetry as @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the ginzburg - landau free energy can always be expanded as @xmath37 where summation convention is implied for the indices @xmath38,@xmath39 etc , and as usual @xmath40 , with @xmath41 the magnetic vector potential .",
    "if the normal state above @xmath13 possesses a symmetry group @xmath42 , then the order parameters @xmath43 can be grouped into terms corresponding to the different irreducible representations @xmath44 of @xmath42 , transforming under symmetry operations as @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and the matrices @xmath47 constitute the representation @xmath44 of the group @xmath42 .",
    "the general theory of group representations implies that we can choose a basis in which the matrix @xmath48 is block diagonal , with each block corresponding to an irreducible representation , @xmath44 . in this basis",
    "the full ginzburg - landau free energy is of the form @xmath49 the quadratic term @xmath50 involves only a single representation , @xmath44 . at @xmath13 , in general , only a single irreducible representation will have a zero eigenvalue of the block diagonal matrix @xmath51 .",
    "therefore only the components of the order parameter @xmath52 corresponding to that eigenvector will become non - zero just below @xmath13 .",
    ".[tableone ] irreducible representations of even and odd parity in a tetragonal crystal .",
    "the symbols @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 represent any functions transforming as @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 under crystal point group operations , while @xmath59 represents any function which is invariant under all point group symmetries .",
    "[ cols=\">,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     using these irreducible representations we can expand the bcs gap function in terms of functions of each separate symmetry class . for odd parity pairing states we can represent the bcs gap function by a vector @xmath60 or a symmetric @xmath61 complex matrix @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for each irreducible representation",
    "we can choose a complete set of orthonormal basis functions in the brillouin zone , @xmath65 .",
    "expanding the gap function in terms of these functions we have @xmath66 the expansion coefficients essentially provide the set of order parameters in eq.[eqglfreeenergy ] .",
    "the basis functions must be periodic in reciprocal space , @xmath67 , or equivalently , they must obey periodic boundary conditions in the 1st brillouin zone .",
    "they can be chosen , most naturally , in terms of their real - space fourier transforms , which correspond to lattice sums of the real - space bravais lattice .",
    "for a body - centred tetragonal crystal , such as sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_one ] , the leading basis functions correspond to the four nearest - neighbour in - plane lattice vectors , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , giving two odd parity basis functions : @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the eight body - centred lattice vectors @xmath72 lead to the four odd - parity basis functions shown in the last column of table [ tablethree ] ( where for simplicity we have chosen units of length such that @xmath73 ) . in the models which we investigate in the remainder of this paper , we shall assume that these basis functions , table [ tablethree ] , are sufficient to describe the gap function .",
    "physically this corresponds to the assumption that the paring interaction @xmath74 is short ranged in real - space .",
    "considering table  [ tableone ] we can see that in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 `` p - wave '' pairing states can correspond to either the a@xmath75 , ( or @xmath76 ) representation or the doubly degenerate e@xmath77 representation ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) . the only symmetry distinct `` f - wave '' pairing states are the b@xmath80 and b@xmath75 representations , corresponding to @xmath81 and @xmath82 type symmetries .",
    "neither of these states can be used in the case of a two - dimensional single - plane model of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , since they both become zero in the plane @xmath83 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that in table  [ tablethree ] there are no basis functions of @xmath84 or @xmath85 symmetry .",
    "pairing in these channels would require long range interactions extending to at least the inter - plane second nearest neighbors .    in the light of these symmetry principles let us comment on a number of the possible gap functions which have been proposed for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "among the five states described by rice and sigrist@xcite the only one consistent with the knight shift experiments is@xcite @xmath86 belonging to the e@xmath77 representation of table  [ tablethree ] .",
    "it breaks time reversal symmetry , consistent with the @xmath16-sr experiments of luke _",
    "et al._@xcite , and leads to a spin susceptibility which is constant below @xmath13 for fields in the @xmath15 plane , consistent with knight shift@xcite and neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "however it has no gap nodes on a fermi surface of cylindrical topology , such as the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 sheets of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , and therefore is inconsistent with the heat capacity@xcite penetration depth@xcite and thermal conductivity experiments@xcite .",
    "on the other hand the f - wave gap function proposed by won and maki@xcite @xmath87 has both line nodes and broken time reversal symmetry below @xmath13 .",
    "however from the symmetry analysis above , it is clear that this does not correspond to a single irreducible representation of the symmetry group .",
    "it is a sum of the function @xmath88 , belonging to b@xmath75 and @xmath89 belonging to b@xmath80 .",
    "although they would be degenerate in a system with cylindrical symmetry , in a tetragonal crystal they will be non - degenerate and hence have different @xmath13s .",
    "the b@xmath80 , b@xmath75 states individually possess time reversal symmetry . therefore with this order parameter",
    "we would expect to find a specific heat anomaly with two transitions , and time reversal symmetry breaking would only occur at temperatures below the lower transition .",
    "the f - wave order parameter proposed by graf and balatsky@xcite , @xmath90 is in the same symmetry class as e@xmath77 , since @xmath91 in table  [ tabletwo ] .",
    "therefore in the sense of pure symmetry arguments the gap nodes in planes @xmath92 and @xmath93 are `` accidental '' .",
    "such a gap function is certainly valid , but the nodes are present for reasons connected with the specific microscopic pairing interaction employed , and not required by symmetry alone .",
    "this comment also applies to the @xmath94 f - wave state @xmath95 discussed by dahm , won and maki,@xcite and eremin _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the full group theoretic classification in tetragonal crystals@xcite and the above analysis does not show _ a single pairing state _ with both symmetry required lines of nodes and spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry below @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , if we accept both the @xmath16-sr and low temperature thermodynamic and transport measurements , then we must consider states which have lines of nodes for specific microscopic reasons , rather then for pure symmetry reasons .    in the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall focus on the specific model which we proposed in a previous paper@xcite , in which the lines of nodes appear in the plane @xmath96 , derived from the pair of inter - plane basis functions of @xmath97 : @xmath98 from table[tablethree ] , as originally suggested by hasegawa _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "since the underlying microscopic mechanism for superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is not known we choose to adopt a phenomenological approach to the pairing mechanism .",
    "we first make an accurate tight binding fit to the experimentally determined fermi surface@xcite and then introduce model attractive interactions between the different orbitals centered on different sites .",
    "we can investigate different ` scenarios ' depending upon which model interactions are assumed to dominate .",
    "frequently , when these pairing interaction parameters are chosen to reproduce the experimental @xmath13 , there is no freedom to adjust the parameters further .",
    "once the parameters have been selected , then a number of different experimental quantities can be calculated independently and compared to experiment .",
    "the goal is to find one specific paring scenario which agrees with all of the experimental observations .",
    "if this can be achieved then one has found an effective hamiltonian for the pairing , which can be interpreted physically .",
    "this effective pairing hamiltonian can then be used to guide the search for the true microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "this methodology has proved very useful in cuprate superconductivity @xcite and here we shall deploy it to study sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .    the effective pairing hamiltonian we consider is a simple multi - band attractive @xmath24 hubbard model : @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 refer to the three ruthenium @xmath102 orbitals @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 and @xmath38 and @xmath39 label the sites of a body centered tetragonal lattice .",

    "the parameter @xmath126 is the only term in the hamiltonian which mixes the @xmath127 orbitals with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . with only these two parameters it is not possible to fit exactly the full three dimensional fermi surface cylinder corrugations determined by bergemann _",
    "et al._@xcite , but the parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 give a reasonable agreement for the dominant experimental corrugations .",
    "[ fig_two ] shows the fitted fermi surface in the plane @xmath83 in the extended zone - scheme .",

    "we solved the above system of bogoliubov de gennes equations including all three bands and the three dimensional tight - binding fermi surface .",
    "we considered a large number of different scenarios for the interaction constants .",
    "first we assumed that the pairing interaction @xmath130 for nearest neighbours in plane is only acting for the @xmath127 ( @xmath26 ) ru orbitals . in this case both a d - wave ( @xmath140 ) pairing state and p - wave ( @xmath141 states are possible .",
    "the d - wave state has line nodes , but would not be consistent with the experiments showing constant knight shift and time reversal symmetry breaking below @xmath13 .",
    "therefore we discard such solutions here , and only concentrate on the odd - parity spin triplet solutions .",
    "the motivation is not to explain the microscopic pairing mechanism , but to model pairing state produced by various types of effective attractive interactions .",
    "these attractive interactions may arise from , for instance , ferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite , which can favour spin triplet pairing compared to the d - wave solutions",
    ". however , their origin may be more complicated , for example a combined electron - phonon and spin fluctuation mechanism .    with only the nearest neighbor in - plane interactions the set of possible odd - parity",
    ", spin triplet , solutions that we found never includes any possible state with nodes of the gap .",
    "therefore we extended the model to include inter - plane interactions . using two interactions , a nearest neighbor in - plane interaction , ( @xmath142 in fig .",
    "[ fig_one ] ) , and a nearest neighbor inter - plane interaction , ( @xmath143 in fig .",
    "[ fig_one ] ) which fulfill the tetragonal symmetry , we have the two types of basis functions for the gap equation given in table  [ tablethree ] .",
    "then we have the possibility of horizontal line nodes in the gap arising from the zeros of @xmath144 at @xmath145 on a cylindrical fermi surface@xcite .    because the pairing interactions @xmath146 were assumed to act only for nearest neighbor sites in or out of plane , the pairing potential @xmath147 is also restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "we further focus on only odd parity ( spin triplet ) pairing states for which the vector @xmath148 , i.e. @xmath149 , and @xmath150 . therefore",
    "in general we have the following non - zero order parameters ( i ) for in plane bonds : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and ( ii ) for inter - plane bonds : @xmath153 for @xmath154 .    taking the lattice fourier transform of eq .",
    "[ deltas ] the corresponding pairing potentials in k - space have the general form ( suppressing the spin indices for clarity ) : @xmath155 note that beyond the usual p - wave symmetry of the @xmath156 and @xmath157 type for the @xmath127 orbitals , we include all three additional p - wave symmetries of the @xmath158 type which are induced by the effective attractive interactions between carriers on the neighboring out - of - plane ru orbitals .",
    "these interactions are also responsible for the f - wave symmetry order parameters , @xmath159 , transforming as @xmath160 in table 1 .",
    "this latter is symmetry distinct from all p - wave order parameters in a tetragonal crystal , unlike the other f - wave states discussed in the introduction@xcite .",
    "the @xmath76 order parameters @xmath161 are of @xmath162 symmetry .",

    "thus , beyond fitting @xmath13 , there are no further adjustable parameters , and one can compare directly the calculated physical properties of the superconducting states to those experimentally observed .",

    "it is important to ask how these results depend on the details of the assumptions made in the model . in order to test the stability of our results to variations in the model we therefore introduced some additional subdominant interaction parameters . for our initial exploration of the issues",

    "( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) as follows : @xmath176 reassuringly , with these modified parameters we obtained a temperature dependence of the gap parameters which are qualitatively similar to those for the original parameters .",

    "the difference becomes more significant ( fig .",
    "[ fig_three]a ) .",

    "[ fig_three]b we show the variation of a few characteristic @xmath183 against @xmath177 at zero temperature .",

    "reassuringly , the corresponding specific heat ( fig .  [ fig_four ] ) is essentially unchanged and remains in equally good agreement with the experiments .",

    "notice also that the excitation gap on the @xmath7 sheet is non - zero even when @xmath195 , because it is hybridized to the @xmath127 orbital and @xmath196 .",
    "note that this nodal structure of the gap is unchanged by the presence of the small subdominant interaction parameter @xmath177 , in eq.([new_u_set ] ) .",
    "however , upon increasing the value of the @xmath177 parameter eventually the results change qualitatively , leading to appearance of additional line nodes in @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "( [ fig_six ] ) ) for @xmath197 . in this case",
    "the @xmath6 band gap also develops a line node , similar to the behavior of the @xmath8 band .",
    "as we noted it earlier , to obtain agreement with experiment we had to eliminate the @xmath9-wave component @xmath198 and we suggested that this can be done by an appeal to the effects of a small amount of disorder .",
    "we shall now substantiate this contention by explicit calculations .    in case of non - magnetic disorder our hamiltonian can be written @xmath199 where @xmath200 is a random site energy . for a given configuration of @xmath200 one can , in principle , perform calculations ( eq . [ deltas]-[eq18 ] ) and then average over many configurations . more readily , for highly disordered systems it is possible to apply mean field theory of disorder by making use of the coherent potential approximation cpa @xcite",
    ".    here however , as superconducting sr@xmath201ruo@xmath202 samples were found to be relatively clean , we can limit our analysis to weak disorder and non - resonant impurity scattering . then knowing the scattering rate @xmath203 we can apply the born approximation @xcite in calculating the self - energy of the disorder averaged green function . following this abrikosov - gorkov approach ,",
    "we assume that impurity scattering will create a finite imaginary self energy of the order @xmath204 thus our equation of self - consistency in the configurationally averaged pair potential can be written in terms of matsubara frequencies @xmath205 as follows @xmath206 where @xmath207 denotes a positive infinitesimal . exchanging the summations over @xmath139 and @xmath208 indices eq .",
    "[ eq26 ] can be written , after decoupling the summation over negative and positive matsubara frequencies , as @xmath209    conveniently the sum on the right hand site of eq .",
    "[ eq29 ] can be evaluated @xcite and it leads to the final formula : @xmath210    note that in the limit of a clean system @xmath211 @xmath212 and eq .",
    "[ eq28 ] coincides with that of the clean system ( eqs .",
    "[ bogoliubov]-[deltas ] ) .",
    "thus , in a weak disorder limit we have again solved the bogoliubov - de gennes equations including a small @xmath203 .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_seven ] where we have plotted the order parameters @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 versus temperature .",
    "evidently in the disordered case the small @xmath9-wave amplitude ( @xmath215 ) is reduced to zero much more rapidly than the larger p - wave ones ( @xmath213 , @xmath214 ) .",
    "furthermore , in fig . [ fig_eight ]",
    "we show disorder dependence of these three paring amplitudes at zero temperature . clearly",
    "each order parameter is reduced to zero in a typical abrikosov - gorkov like manner , becoming zero approximately when the pair - breaking parameter @xmath216 .    from figs .",
    "( [ fig_seven ] ) and ( [ fig_eight ] ) it is clear that , for moderate scattering rates , there is a region where the f - wave gap components are reduced to zero but the larger p - wave components are more or less unaffected .",
    "thus we conclude that the simultaneous neglect of @xmath161 and @xmath159 and @xmath203 is justified@xcite .",
    "it would be an interesting experimental confirmation of this model , if ultra - clean samples were found to have a second phase transition at a much lower temperature than @xmath217 .",
    "to get a single superconducting transition temperatures within our interlayer coupling model we are forced to fine tune two interaction parameters . however , it has been proposed@xcite that a single transition can be obtained in an multiband model by allowing for a symmetry mixing interaction of the type @xmath218 , where @xmath219 and @xmath220 are order parameter symmetry functions for respective bands .",
    "it is the aim of the present section to check to which extend similar approach may be used in our bond model .",
    "we start with short discussion of the source and magnitude of symmetry mixing interaction .",
    "the description we have used is a real space , two point near neighbour interaction such as naturally arises in any multi - orbital , extended , negative @xmath24 hubbard model , eq .",
    "[ hubbard ] . to be quite clear about this matter we recall that a generic pair - wise interaction like @xmath221 , when expressed in the language of a tight - binding model hamiltonian will , in general , give rise to four point interaction parameters @xmath222 .",
    "the original hubbard hamiltonian makes use of the one point parameters @xmath223 whilst the extended hubbard model is based on two point parameters @xmath224 .",
    "evidently our ` bond ' model is a negative u - version of the latter@xcite .",
    "the symmetry mixing interactions@xcite arise from 3-site interactions @xmath225 .",
    "the physics of this is often referred to as assisted hopping@xcite .",
    "if one assumes , as is normally the case in an isotropic substance , that latexmath:[$    stronger coupling than assisted hopping and should be the preferred coupling mechanism .",
    "however , for the tetragonal arrangement of ru atoms in sr@xmath201ruo@xmath1 this is no more than a suggestion at present .    in the presence of a three point interaction @xmath227 , for all nearest neighbours @xmath228 such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are in one ru plane while @xmath229 is on a neigbouring one ( fig .",
    "[ fig_one ] ) , the gap equation ( eqs .",
    "[ bogoliubov]-[eq18 ] ) can be rewritten in k - space as,@xcite    @xmath230    where , as before , @xmath231    in a body centered tetragonal crystal ( fig .  [ fig_one ] ) the various matrix elements of the general four point interaction @xmath232 responsible for p - wave paring can be written ( suppressing spin indices for clarity ) : @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are respectively : @xmath236    note that the three point interaction leads to an extra interlayer coupling proportional to @xmath237 .",
    "interestingly , the general form of the order parameter is the same as previously derived ( eqs .",
    "( [ bogoliubov]-[eq20 ] ) ) despite the additional three point coupling eq .",
    "( [ eq33 ] ) in the self - consistency relation eqs .",
    "( [ eq31]-[eq32 ] ) .",
    "it has to be noted that the presence of interaction @xmath237 strongly changes @xmath13 . to get its correct value ( 1.5k ) for the present model we have taken @xmath238mev @xmath239 @xmath240mev and repeated our calculations for various @xmath237 values .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "( [ fig_nine ] ) and ( [ fig_ten ] ) .",
    "( [ fig_nine ] ) shows the results for the amplitudes @xmath241 and @xmath242 including the three - point interaction .",
    "note that for @xmath243 ( curves labeled by ( 1 ) in the figure ) the temperature where @xmath244 becomes non - zero is much higher than that where @xmath242 becomes non - zero .",
    "it is evident from the figure that for @xmath245 the parameters @xmath246 for @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath127 orbitals vanish at the same temperature and two transitions merge into one .",
    "thus , the proximity coupling mechanism identified by zr@xcite in their band description of the electron - electron interaction , also works in our bond model .",
    "intriguingly , although the proximity coupling works in principle , the above mechanism does not seem to be helpful in the context of building phenomenological interactions suitable to describe experimental data . to illustrate this point we reproduce , in fig .",
    "( [ fig_ten ] ) , the specific heat corresponding to the set of @xmath241 and @xmath242 shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_nine ] ) . clearly , as @xmath237 increases the second transition at low temperature becomes enlarged and merges with the first transition at higher temperature .",
    "however , the small values of @xmath237 shown in figs .",
    "( [ fig_nine ] , [ fig_ten ] ) are not sufficient to get the specific heat jump at @xmath13 right",
    ". therefore @xmath237 must be large for the zr scenario to fit the experiments .",
    "by contrast , as we have demonstrated earlier , if @xmath247 and the sizes of @xmath169 and @xmath168 are adjusted so that only one transition occurs both the low temperature slope and the jump at @xmath13 agrees with experiments .",
    "thus although we have not investigated models featuring a ` proximity effect ' induced by @xmath248 type of interactions systematically we conclude that such interactions are not needed to fit the available data .",
    "finally , it is also interesting to see what are the effects of disorder on the ` orbital proximity effect ' ; the results are shown in fig . [ fig_eleven ] .",
    "we see that , disorder can eliminate the gap on @xmath7 , @xmath8 sheets , while leaving it almost unchanged on @xmath6 .",
    "this feature of the proximity effect scenario opens it up for experimental verification by measurement on samples with increasing disorder .",
    "evidently the effect of disorder should be that the low temperature power laws disappear due to the destruction of superconductivity on the @xmath7 , @xmath8 sheets .    * vi . conclusions *    we have introduced a methodology for building semi - phenomenological , attractive electron - electron interactions bond by bond for calculating superconducting properties under circumstances when the physical mechanism of pairing is not known",
    ". we deployed it to study @xmath10-wave pairing in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "a bond was described by an interaction constant @xmath249 which depends on the sites @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the orbitals @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and their spin orientation @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we have solved the appropriate bogoliubov de gennes equations for a number of scenarios defined by a small set of interaction constants .",
    "we have found that the one for which @xmath250 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 being nearest neighbour ruthenium atoms in the ru - o planes and @xmath251 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 being nearest on neighbouring planes explained most of the available experimental data .",
    "namely , the corresponding solution featured a gap function on the @xmath6-sheet of the form @xmath252 and and a line of gap on the @xmath8 sheet .",
    "for this scenario the requirement that there be only one transition at @xmath253  k fixed both @xmath169 and @xmath168 and hence all further results could be regarded as quantitative predictions of the model .",
    "remarkably , the model gave a satisfactory account of the data for the specific heat @xmath254 , superfluid density @xmath5 and the thermal conductivity @xmath255 .",
    "we have also investigated the stability of the model to introduction of further interaction constants and disorder .",
    "we found that the predictions of the model are robust to changes of new interactions , while disorder mainly affects the f - wave solution .",
    "thus we can conclude that the experimental data support a simple model which describes , quantitatively , the @xmath10-wave pairing observed in sr@xmath0ru0@xmath1 on the basis of two orbital specific coupling constants : @xmath256  mev @xmath257  mev .",
    "the central physical feature of the model is that @xmath168 corresponds to interaction between electrons in the ruthenium planes while @xmath169 describes an inter - plane interaction of roughly equal strength .    in view of the above results",
    ", we would like to emphasize two points .",
    "firstly , we have proposed an alternative to the the ` intra - band proximity effect ' model of zhitomirsky and rice@xcite for describing horizontal line nodes on the @xmath258 sheets of the fermi surface in superconducting sr@xmath201ruo@xmath202 .",
    "our bond model differs from theirs in the way the interlayer coupling is implemented .",
    "the extension of the model in the spirit of zr has also been studied by allowing for 3-site interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "even though the resulting bond proximity model features single superconducting transition temperature the original model with fine tuned two interactions gives better fit to experimental t dependence of the specific heat .",
