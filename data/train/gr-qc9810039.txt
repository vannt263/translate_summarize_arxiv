    "the canonical form of general relativity is presented by dirac @xcite , and by arnowitt , deser and misner ( adm ) @xcite . in the formulation ,",

    "for quantization of the gravity , the constraints are used as operator restrictions on the state , and the hamiltonian constraint gives the wheeler - dewitt(wd ) equation@xcite .",
    "the canonical quantum gravity based on the wheeler - dewitt approach has mathematical and conceptual difficulties .",
    "the wd equation is a functional differential equation with respect to the three dimensional metric components @xmath0 and includes the product of the functional derivatives .",
    "when the space is inhomogeneous , one can hardly solve this equation of infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "it has also an operator ordering ambiguity .",
    "if one reduce the degrees of freedom to finite by symmetry , the wd equation becomes a greatly simple and solvable equation .",
    "kucha@xmath1 studied the geometrodynamics of schwarzschild black holes @xcite .",
    "the black hole mass is shown to be a dynamical variable on the phase space .",
    "nakamura , konno , oshiro and tomimatsu applied the canonical formulation to the inside of the horizon of the schwarzschild black hole , and obtained an exact solution of the wd equation under a condition of a mass eigenstate equation . in the wkb region ,",
    "their solution correspond to a classical black hole solution and they derived a semiclassical picture from the exact solution @xcite .",
    "the wkb approximation breaks down if a variation of a potential is considerably large over a wave length .",
    "in this situation the frequency of the wave function is very high and the amplitude violently fluctuates .",
    "therefore they were inhibited from interpreting the wave function near the horizon . in the region where the scalar curvature becomes very large such as a horizon , a sensible quantum effect of the spacetime is expected to appear prominently .",
    "we can not neglect the influence of the spacetime fluctuation on the hawking radiation @xcite . in our preceding paper@xcite",
    ", we solved the wd equation for a minisuperspace and obtained the wave function for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "then we applied the de broglie - bohm(dbb ) interpretation to the wave function in order to estimate the quantum fluctuations instead of the wkb approach .",
    "further we investigated the operator ordering ambiguity on the quantum effect . in the dbb approach@xcite , by introducing a rigid trajectory picture thorough the phase factor of the wave function , we can make quantitative estimations of quantum effects near horizons and make a natural derivation of the ( semi)classical picture from the quantum theory without having to assume an outside observer and having to cause the collapse of the wave function .",
    "the emergence of the classical picture from quantum systems is a problem under debate by several authors @xcite . in regard to the conceptual problem of time ,",
    "that is , there is no time evolution in the wd equation , we can also get the parametric time in a natural way , although the general covariance spontaneously breaks down at a quantum level .",
    "the purpose of our work is to investigate static states of quantum geometry near the horizons .",
    "we solve the wd equation for the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter(rnds ) black hole .",
    "the rnds geometry has some specific features such that the cauchy horizon and the timelike singularity exist . in our minisuperspace",
    ", the dbb trajectory picture shows that quantum effects are dominant near all horizons while the trajectory asymptotically approaches to the classical one in an infinite region or the singularity .",

    "a static spherically symmetric solution of it is known as the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter(rnds ) metric @xmath8 which describes a black hole with the mass @xmath9 and the electric charge @xmath10 in the background of the static de sitter space .",

    "let us restrict our attention to the inside of the horizon , where the radial coordinate plays the role of the time coordinate .",
    "we denote the coordinate as @xmath12 .",
    "we introduce two metric variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 which depend only on @xmath12 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lapse function .",
    "because of spherical symmetry , the shift vector @xmath17 except the radial component @xmath18 must be zero .",
    "we have chosen the radial component @xmath18 to be zero taking account of the static spacetime . using the metric eq.([uv ] ) the action eq.([gravaction ] ) is decomposed into the adm hypersurface action @xmath19 where the lagrangian is @xmath20 with @xmath21 which is the @xmath22 component of the field strength @xmath6 . here",
    "the notations are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "although we have assumed that the electromagnetic field @xmath25 depends only on time variable @xmath12 , the field @xmath26 is a redundant degree of freedom and we need not to impose the symmetry on @xmath26 .    the euler - lagrange equation for the system eq.([laguv ] ) gives the classical solution : @xmath27 which correspond to the extension of the rnds spacetime eq.([rndsmetric ] ) .",

    "the legendre transformation gives the hamiltonian and the action for this system is @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 here we integral out over the unit sphere and treat the integral @xmath46 to be finite .",

    "the secondary constraints do not generate further constraints , because the poisson brackets with the hamiltonian weakly vanish .",
    "then the hamiltonian constraints are the first class .",
    "we also introduce the black hole mass as a dynamical variable on canonical data . following the calculation of the schwarzschild mass by kucha@xmath1 , the rnds black hole mass",
    "is expressed as @xmath51    next we quantize the black hole system in the schrdinger representation .",

    "then we further transform the variables @xmath33 and @xmath64 to @xmath67 and @xmath68 : @xmath69 using the variables eq.([yz ] ) , eqs.([l ] ) and ( [ wd ] ) become the form : @xmath70 the equation ( [ bessel ] ) for @xmath62 is the bessel s differential equation with zeroth order . then we finally obtain an exact solution of the rnds quantum black hole : @xmath71^{1/2 } , \\label{fisolution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are integration constants .",

    "we can rewrite it in the real part and the imaginary part equations : @xmath81 where the function @xmath82 is @xmath83 here we use the constraint equation for the charge eq.([q ] ) in advance . as a result the dependence of the function @xmath82 and the equations ( [ rewd ] ) and ( [ imwd ] ) on the variable @xmath38 is removed .    in the dbb interpretation",

    "eqs.([rewd ] ) and ( [ imwd ] ) indicate the hamilton - jacobi equation and the continuity equation of the probability , respectively . in the eq.([rewd ] ) , there is a term @xmath82 which is not present in the classical hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the trajectories are modified by this term quantitatively .",
    "if @xmath82 is negligible compared with the classical potential , the quantum trajectory approaches to the classical one and indeed this situation is what we call _ classical_. in this sense we call the function @xmath82 _ quantum potential_. we recall that the quantum theory itself is applied to the system of an ensemble , that is , one must perform many measurements to one particle to obtain the wave function . in the ordinary copenhagen interpretation ,",
    "the system is divided into the external observer described by the classical mechanics and the quantum system , and the notion of the probability enters the theory . in the de broglie - bohm interpretation ,",
    "on the other hand , there is no division between the classical observer and the quantum system and no collapse of the wave function .",
    "the predictability of the quantum mechanics stems from the notion of the distribution of a statistical ensemble of well defined quantum trajectories , which are modified by a quantum effect produced by the quantum potential .    for our minisuperspace model",
    ", we calculate the quantum potential and the quantum trajectories .",
    "we select the second term of the solution eq.([solution ] ) @xmath89 since @xmath90 is a outgoing wave from the singularity at the origin to the outside . from the dbb point of view",
    ", it will be shown to correspond to the classical black hole ( fig.2 ) . on the contrary , the superposition of @xmath91 and @xmath92 in eq.([fisolution ] )",
    "does not approach any classical solution .",
    "the equations on the velocities eqs.([p+]),([p- ] ) and ( [ pa ] ) are obtained as @xmath93 the ratio of eq.([dotz+ ] ) to eq.([dotz- ] ) gives a functional relation @xmath94 .",

    "the quantum potential eq.([vq ] ) is expressed as @xmath99 the behavior in the flat region @xmath100 and near the horizons@xmath101 is approximately v_q \\ {    lr 0 &  for  z 1 +   + &  for  z 0 .    .",
    "@xmath82 approaches to zero at infinity , where the amplitude @xmath78 becomes a constant .",
    "near the horizon , on the other hand , @xmath82 takes a infinite value .    using the @xmath102 relation ( [ uvrel ] ) , the remaining relation @xmath103 is obtained in the integral form : @xmath104 we can show that the @xmath103 relation approaches to the classical relation @xmath105 in the semiclassical region .",
    "we estimate the @xmath103 relation ( [ tv ] ) near the horizons as t - t_0 \\ {    lr &  for  z 1 +   + 12 ( z lnz)^2 &  for  z 0 ,    . where @xmath106 is an integration constant . the numerical estimation of eq.([tv ] )",
    "is shown in fig.2 .",
    "we fixed @xmath107 at @xmath108 and carried out the integral in eq.([tv ] ) .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath109 of the dbb trajectory is diminishing as approaching to the horizons @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "near the horizons , @xmath112 of the quantum trajectory shows flat behavior and takes a finite value .",
    "we connect the oppssite sides of the horizon smoothly on the dbb trajectory .",
    "fig.2 shows that the radial coordinate @xmath112 of(at ) the horizons of the quantum black hole is smaller than that of the classical one , while the quantum surface area is identical with the classical one ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "now we consider apparent horizons .",
    "the horizon is characterized by the expansions for the ingoing and outgoing null rays @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "classically the equation @xmath117 expresses the apparent horizon .",
    "therefore it has a local meaning , while the event horizons which exist at the null surface @xmath32 has a global meaning . in our black hole model based on the canonical approach , we have introduced the black hole mass as a dynamical variable on canonical data .",
    "the black hole mass have a classical relation to the expansion @xmath118 : @xmath119 in classical level the apparent horizon @xmath120 agrees with the event horizon through the relation eq.([u ] ) . in quantum level , the apparent and the event horizon are may be allowed not to coincide by quantum fluctuations .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we define the apparent horizons in quantum level by @xmath121 . the mass operator @xmath55 and the electromagnetic momenta @xmath122 in this definition are reduced to the eigen values @xmath28 and @xmath10 respectively , and therefore @xmath32 must be satisfied on the quantum apparent horizons .",
    "the quantum apparent horizon agrees with the quantum event horizon obtained by the dbb calculus .",
    "thereby the separation of the event and the apparent horizon is not found from the dbb point of view .    in order to investigate the property of the horizon",
    ", we also calculate the radial motion of the light ray . here",
    "we treat the light ray as a classical object in the quantum background geometry .",
    "the coordinate of the light ray on the dbb trajectory is @xmath123 for comparison , the light ray in the classical reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black hole is @xmath124 using eq.([tv ] ) , the approximate behavior near the horizon @xmath125 of eq.([rv ] ) is estimated as r -r_0 \\ {    lr r_cl   &  for  z 1 +   + z(ln z)^2 &  for  z 0 , [ apprv ]    .",
    "where @xmath126 denotes an integration constant . in fig.3 , the numerical estimation of eq.([rv ] )",
    "is shown . the integration constant @xmath126 is fixed at the origin @xmath127 and the infinity @xmath128 in order that the light ray on the quantum trajectory coincides with that on the classical trajectory .",
    "the light ray forms a cups and reaches the horizons at finite @xmath129 .",
    "we studied the quantum geometrodynamics of the vacuum spacetime with spherical symmetry through a device of solving the wheeler - dewitt(wd ) equation in the mini - superspace .",
    "we estimate the wave function from a viewpoint of the de broglie - bohm(dbb ) interpretation .",
    "the distinctive feature of the dbb approach based on well defined quantum trajectories is that we can quantitatively estimate all quantum effects including the gravitation , even if the norm of the wave function can not be defined . in a region where all quantum effects vanish ,",
    "these trajectories are approach to classical ones . in this manner",
    ", we can always resolve the quantum theory into the ( semi)classical one without having to assume an external observer and having to invoke the collapse of the wave function .",
    "in particular these properties are agreeable to quantum cosmology .    in our calculation , we do not address a boundary contribution for the hamiltonian which gives the adm energy .",
    "for the system of coordinates on the hypersurface @xmath130 which is asymptotically cartesian , the adm energy of a black hole observed at the right and the left infinity is its black hole mass @xcite .",
    "j. mkel and p. repo studied the dynamical aspects of the quantum reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the adm mass and the electric charge spectra of the black hole are discrete .",
    "moreover their semiclassical analysis showed that the horizon area spectrum of black holes is closely related to the bekensteins s proposal .",
    "our calculation shows that the quantum potential becomes zero at infinity .",
    "if there are the boundary terms , the quantum potential at the boundary will be significant@xcite .",
    "york introduced the idea of the quantum ergosphere that the apparent and the event horizon are separated quantum mechanically @xcite and then nakamura et al proposed that the gravitational fluctuation spontaneously induces the phenomena .",
    "our analysis shows that the mass eigen state does not distinguish the two horizons .",
    "rather , the quantum effect of the gravitational field makes the photon propagating along the radial coordinate reach the horizon within a finite time @xmath129 .",
    "this may indicate that the causal connection between the opposite sides of the horizon is tied more strongly than in the case of the classical black hole .",
    "we can also propose that the quantum effect enhances the hawking radiation .",
    "further analysis is needed to judge these suggestions ."
