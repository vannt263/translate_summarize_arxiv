    "stars in nature are usually rotating and may be subject to non - axisymmetric rotational instabilities .",
    "an exact treatment of these instabilities exists only for incompressible equilibrium fluids in newtonian gravity , e.g. @xcite . for these configurations",
    ", global rotational instabilities may arise from non - radial toroidal modes @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the azimuthal angle ) .    for sufficiently rapid rotation ,",
    "the @xmath2 bar mode becomes either _ secularly _ or _ dynamically _ unstable .",
    "the onset of instability can typically be marked by a critical value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath3 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath4 the gravitational potential energy .",
    "uniformly rotating , incompressible stars in newtonian theory are secularly unstable to bar - mode formation when @xmath9 .",
    "this instability can grow only in the presence of some dissipative mechanism , like viscosity or gravitational radiation , and the associated growth timescale is the dissipative timescale , which is usually much longer than the dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "by contrast , a dynamical instability to bar - mode formation sets in when @xmath10 .",
    "this instability is independent of any dissipative mechanism , and the growth time is the hydrodynamic timescale .",
    "there are several papers indicating that dynamical instability of the rotating stars occurs at low @xmath0 , which is far below the standard criterion of dynamical instability in newtonian gravity .",
    "tohline and hachisu @xcite find in the self - gravitating ring and tori that @xmath2 dynamical instability occurs around @xmath11 in the lowest case in the centrally condensed configurations .",
    "shibata , karino , and eriguchi @xcite find that @xmath2 dynamical instability occurs around @xmath12 in the high degree ( @xmath13 ) of differential rotation .",
    "note that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the angular velocity at the center and at the equatorial surface , respectively .",
    "centrella et al .",
    "@xcite found dynamical @xmath1 instability around @xmath16 in the @xmath17 polytropic toroidal star with high degree ( @xmath18 ) of differential rotation , and saijo , baumgarte , and shapiro @xcite extended the results of dynamical @xmath1 instability to @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath21 is the polytropic index of the star .",
    "there are some indications that corotation resonance triggers dynamical bar instability .",
    "papaloizou and pringle @xcite found that non - selfgravitating tori with constant specific angular momentum are unstable to low order non - axisymmetric modes and that the modes grow on a dynamical time - scale .",
    "watts , andersson , and jones @xcite argue that the shear instabilities occur when the degree of differential rotation exceeds a critical value and the @xmath22-mode develops a corotation point associated with the presence of a continuous spectrum .",
    "they also point out that dynamical bar instability that shibata et al .",
    "@xcite found is in the corotation band .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we show the snapshots of canonical angular momentum density in fig .",
    "[ fig : jc ] . since we determine the corotation radius using the extracted eigenfrequency and the angular velocity profile at equilibrium , the radius does not change throughout the evolution . for low @xmath0 dynamical instability ,",
    "the distribution of the canonical angular momentum drastically changes its sign around the corotation radius , and the maximum amount of canonical angular momentum density increases at the early stage of evolution .",
    "this means that the angular momentum flows inside the corotation radius in the evolution . on the other hand , for high @xmath0 dynamical instability that is related to the classical bar instability ,",
    "the distribution of the canonical angular momentum is smooth with no particular feature and tends to have a positive portion outside .",
    "this means that the canonical angular momentum flows outwards in the evolution , which is in clear contrast to the case of low @xmath0 one .    from these different behaviors of the distribution of the canonical angular momentum ,",
    "we see that the mechanisms working in the low @xmath0 instabilities and the classical bar instability may be quite different , i.e. , in the former the corotation resonance of modes are essential , while the instability is global in the latter case .",
    "we have studied the nature of dynamical one - armed spiral instability in differentially rotating stars both in linear eigenmode analysis and in hydrodynamic simulation using canonical angular momentum distribution .",
    "we have found that the one - armed spiral instability occurs around the corotation radius of the star by investigating the distribution of the canonical angular momentum .",
    "we have also found by investigating the canonical angular momentum that the instability grows through the inflow of the angular momentum inside the corotation radius .",
    "the feature also holds for the dynamical bar instability in low @xmath0 , which is in clear contrast to that of classical dynamical bar instability in high @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the existence of corotation point inside the star plays a significant role of exciting one - armed spiral mode and bar mode dynamically in low @xmath0 .     in the equatorial plane for 3 differentially rotating stars ( see table [ tab : initial ] ) .",
    "solid , dotted , dashed , and dash - dotted line represents the time @xmath23(3.47 , 6.93 , 10.40 , 13.86 ) for model i , @xmath23(45.68 , 56.43 , 67.18 , 77.97 ) for model ii , and @xmath23(1.10 , 2.19 , 3.29 , 4.39 ) for model iii , respectively .",
    "note that vertical line in panels i and ii denotes the corotation radius of the star ( model iii does not have a corotation radius ) .",
    "we also enlarged the figure around the corotation radius for panels i and ii , which is presented in the right upper part of each panel .",
    "although our method of determining the corotation radius is not precise , we clearly find that the distribution significantly changes around the corotation radius . , width=264 ]    finally , we mention the feature of gravitational waves generated from this instability .",
    "quasi - periodic gravitational waves emitted by stars with @xmath1 instabilities have smaller amplitudes than those emitted by stars unstable to the @xmath2 bar mode . for @xmath1 modes ,",
    "the gravitational radiation is emitted not by the primary mode itself , but by the @xmath2 secondary harmonic which is simultaneously excited , possibly through non - linear self - coupling of m=1 mode .",
    "( remarkably the precedent studies @xcite found that the pattern speed of @xmath2 mode is almost the same as that of @xmath1 mode , which suggest the former is the harmonic of the latter . ) unlike the case for bar - unstable stars , the gravitational wave signal does not persist for many periods , but instead is damped fairly rapidly .",
