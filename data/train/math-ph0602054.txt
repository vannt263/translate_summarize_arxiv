    "frequently used combinations are the normal component of the velocity and the tangential component of the friction ( slip condition for uncovered fluid surfaces ) or the tangential component of the velocity and the normal component of the friction ( condition for in / out - stream surfaces ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider mixed boundary value problems for the system ( [ navier - s ] ) in a three - dimensional domain @xmath9 of polyhedral type , where components of the velocity and/or the friction are given on the boundary . to be more precise , we have one of the following boundary conditions on each face @xmath10 :    * @xmath11 , * @xmath12 , * @xmath13 , * @xmath14 ,    where @xmath15 denotes the normal and @xmath16 the tangential component of @xmath2 , @xmath17 is the vector @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the normal component and @xmath20 the tangential component of @xmath17 .",

    "the properties of solutions of the dirichlet problem to the nonlinear navier - stokes system in 2-dimensional polygonal domains were studied in papers by kondratev @xcite , kellogg and osborn @xcite , kalex @xcite , orlt and sndig @xcite .",

    "mixed boundary value problems with boundary conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) in 3-dimensional domains with smooth non - intersecting edges were handled by solonnikov @xcite , mazya , plamenevski and stupyalis @xcite .",
    "they proved in particular the solvability in weighted sobolev and hlder spaces . for the case of the dirichlet problem and a polyhedral domain , solvability and regularity results in weighted sobolev and",

    "ebmeyer and frehse proved that @xmath42 with arbitrary real @xmath43 if the angle at the edge , where the boundary conditions change , is less than @xmath44 .",
    "finally , we mention the papers by deuring and von wahl @xcite , dindos and mitrea @xcite dealing with the navier - stokes system in lipschitz domains .",
    "the present paper consists of four sections .",
    "section 1 concerns the existence of weak solutions in @xmath45 . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce and study weighted sobolev and hlder space . here",
    "the weights are powers of the distances @xmath46 and @xmath47 to the vertices and edges of the domain @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "in particular , we establish imbedding theorems for these spaces .",
    "in contrast to the papers @xcite , we use weighted spaces with `` nonhomogeneous '' norms .",
    "the weighted sobolev space @xmath48 in our paper is defined as the set of all functions @xmath2 in @xmath9 such that @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "the norm in the weighted hlder space @xmath52 has a similar structure .",
    "the use of weighted spaces with nonhomogeneous norms has several advantages .",
    "first , these spaces are applicable to a wider class of boundary value problems . for @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "they are closely related to the nonweighted spaces . furthermore in some cases",
    "( e.g. the dirichlet problem when the edge angles are less than @xmath44 ) , it is possible to obtain higher regularity results when considering solutions in weighted spaces with nonhomogeneous norms .",
    "so we can partially improve the results in @xcite .",
    "the main results of the paper are contained in section 3 .",
    "for the proofs , we use results of our previous papers @xcite , where we studied mixed boundary value problems for the linear stokes system .",
    "we show in particular that the weak solution @xmath29 belongs to the weighted space @xmath55 if the data are from corresponding spaces , satisfy certain compatibility conditions , and the numbers @xmath56 and @xmath57 are positive and sufficiently small .",
    "the precise conditions on @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given in terms of eigenvalues of certain operator pencils .",
    "the general results in section 3 together with estimates for the eigenvalue of these pencils ( see @xcite ) allow us in particular to deduce regularity assertions in nonweighted sobolev and hlder spaces .",
    "a number of examples is given at the end of section 3 .",
    "the last section concerns the solvability in the space @xmath60 , where @xmath28 may be less than 2 . here",
