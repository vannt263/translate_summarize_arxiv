    "one of the goals in the microscopic nuclear many - body theory is the ab - initio nuclear structure calculation starting with a fixed hamiltonian . indeed ,",
    "recent green s function monte - carlo calculation with a bare nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is a milestone in this direction @xcite .",
    "however , these ab - initio calculations are still limited to nuclei with mass number less than around twelve and to the lowest energy state for each parity and angular momentum .",
    "the no - core shell model @xcite utilizes unitary transformation to accommodate the short - range correlations .",
    "these introduce effective nn interactions ( without phenomenological adjustments ) , however their applications are also limited to light nuclei near the closed configurations .",
    "systematic description of ground and excited states in nuclei in a wide mass region requires development of a new computational approach .",
    "one of difficulties of the nuclear many - body problem is due to the strong short - range correlation .",
    "this forbids a naive mean - field approach using the bare nn interaction . in order to overcome this difficulty , effective nn interactions",
    "have been extensively developed in history of the nuclear theory @xcite .",
    "namely , the short - range behavior of two - body correlation is effectively renormalized in the interaction .",
    "then , nuclear many - body wave functions should take account of long - range correlations only .",
    "most of microscopic nuclear structure models adopt the effective interactions ; e.g. , nuclear mean - field models @xcite , shell models @xcite , cluster models @xcite , etc .",
    "the success of these models indicates that a variety of low - lying modes of excitation are governed by nothing but the long - range correlations . in the present study",
    ", we aim for developing a new method to treat the whole correlation of long range beyond the mean field , utilizing the effective interaction for the mean - field models .    to test our theory , we will apply the method to light @xmath4 even - even nuclei .",
    "there are a variety of nuclear models for light nuclei .",
    "yet , the existing models are not satisfactory in some respects .",
    "the shell model nicely describes spectroscopic properties of light nuclei .",
    "however , since the model space is truncated to a specific shell , states very different from the ground state , which require a wider space , can not be described adequately .",
    "a classic example is the second @xmath5 state in @xmath2o .",
    "although this is the lowest - lying excited state of this doubly closed - shell nucleus , the shell model fails .",
    "the state has been successfully described by the cluster model .",
    "the nuclear cluster models have provided a fruitful description of many light nuclei , especially for those states lying close to the threshold .",
    "the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) , which was first utilized for study of heavy - ion collision @xcite , is an extension of the microscopic cluster model successful to describe shell - model - like states as well @xcite .",
    "however , the model space of the amd is a superposition of small number of slater determinants whose orbitals are restricted to a gaussian form .",
    "these models , the shell model and the amd , are applicable to either light nuclei or those near the closed configuration .",
    "in contrast , the nuclear mean - field theory has been successful to describe nuclei of a wide mass region with a few parameters associated with the ( density - dependent ) effective nuclear force .",
    "the theory provides a reasonable description with a single slater determinant for total binding energy , radius , and deformation of ground states .",
    "however , the superposition of multiple slater is often required .",
    "for example , when the mean - field solution violates symmetries of the original hamiltonian , one should superpose many slater determinants to restore the symmetry ( `` projection '' ) @xcite .",
    "the symmetry restoration is crucial for many properties of light nuclei .",
    "recently , we have developed a method of the parity ( angular momentum ) projection before ( after ) variation , and have shown that the mean - field model is capable of describing some typical cluster structures in light nuclei @xcite . in this paper , we intend to further extend the method to a kind of _ complete _ calculation of the long - range correlations , to obtain energies and wave functions for the ground and low - lying excited states starting from a nuclear mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "our method has some resemblance to the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite and the mote carlo shell model ( mcsm ) @xcite . in the gcm , the generator coordinate is adopted _ a priori _ , under a certain physical intuition , to describe specific long - range correlations ; e.g. , quadrupole and octupole correlation . in most practical calculations ,",
    "the coordinate is limited to one dimension .",
    "our method stochastically take into account all the important correlations . in the mcsm ,",
    "basis states are stochastically generated and selected , then the diagonalization of the hamiltonian is performed in the space spanned by those states .",
    "this concept is very similar to ours , but we use the mean - field - model hamiltonian and our model space is much wider than that of the shell model ,    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we present the outline of our method .",
    "its details are described in the following sections ; selection of slater determinants and the parity and angular momentum projection are shown in secs .",
    "[ sec : s - det ] and [ sec : projection ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixing ] , we discuss configuration mixing calculation and how to avoid numerical instability caused by the overcompleteness of a selected basis and numerical errors",
    ". then , we test the accuracy of our approach by taking @xmath6 as an example . in sec .  [ sec : c_ne ] , we compare numerical results of @xmath7 and @xmath8 to experimental data . the summary is given in sec .  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we present the outline of our method to illustrate its essence . roughly speaking ,",
    "our method consists of three steps ;    1 .   generation and selection of slater determinants ( s - det s ) important for ground and low - lying excited states .",
    "2 .   parity and angular momentum projection .",
    "3 .   configuration mixing ( diagonalization of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "each of these steps is not as straightforward as it first looks . for the step ( 1 ) , since the short - range correlation is renormalized in the effective interaction , we should be careful not to adopt a s - det involving components with very high momentum .",
    "for the step ( 2 ) , since there is no symmetry restriction on the wave function , we need to carry out the projection with respect to the full three - dimensional euler angles .",
    "the diagonalization in ( 3 ) is cursed by the well - known overcompleteness problem of non - orthogonal basis and also by accumulated numerical errors in the step ( 2 ) .",
    "we will present prescriptions to overcome these problems in secs .",
    "[ sec : s - det ] , [ sec : projection ] , and [ sec : mixing ] , respectively .    following the prescription given in sec .",
    "[ sec : s - det ] , many s - det s are stochastically generated , then those important for low - energy excitations are selected .",
    "single - particle wave functions in each s - det are represented in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) cartesian coordinate space without any symmetry restriction .",
    "the selected s - det s form a basis set , @xmath9 .",
    "we then make parity and angular momentum projection for each s - det .",
    "the hamiltonian and the norm kernels for the fixed parity ( @xmath10 ) and angular momentum @xmath11 , where @xmath12 indicates its body - fixed component , are given by @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the many - body hamiltonian with effective interaction , @xmath15 is the parity projection operator , and @xmath16 is the angular momentum projection operator . finally , we solve the following generalized eigenvalue problem , @xmath17 if the space spanned by the set of the s - det s , @xmath9 , is approximately complete for the long - range correlation , we should obtain a convergent solution for the ground and the low - lying excited states . note",
    "that this is merely an outline of the method . as a matter of fact ,",
    "in order to avoid the zero eigenvalues of the norm kernels , we will screen the selected basis states and modify eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gee ] ) . this prescription will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixing ] .    to demonstrate applicability of our method",
    ", we show numerical calculations employing the simplified mean - field hamiltonian , the so - called bkn force @xcite .",
    "the bkn force consists of two - body plus three - body forces .",
    "the two - body force consists of those of zero - range part ( @xmath18 ) , finite - range yukawa part ( @xmath19 ) , and the coulomb part ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the three - body term is a zero - range force ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 the bkn interaction assumes that all nucleons have a charge @xmath24 , and four nucleons with different spin and isospin occupy the same spatial orbital .",
    "to express the orbital wave functions , we employ a grid representation discretizing 3d cartesian coordinate .",
    "grid points inside a sphere of 8 fm are adopted with grid spacing of 0.8 fm .",
    "schematic picture of the energy surface .",
    "two crosses represents minima of the energy surface .",
    "three paths , ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , show imaginary - time trajectories starting from different initial s - det s .",
    "the dotted arrow of ( b ) indicates the trajectory ( b ) passes through a shoulder state . ]",
    "the first step is to prepare a set of s - det s that span the space necessary for low - lying states with the full long - range correlations .",
    "we make use of the imaginary - time method starting from initial configurations which are generated stochastically . the imaginary - time method is often used to obtain self - consistent solutions .",
    "instead , we utilize it for generating many kinds of low - energy collective surfaces .",
    "we pick up s - det s on the way to the self - consistent solutions before reaching minima , and employ them in the configuration mixing calculation .    figure  [ fig : itsm1 ] shows a schematic picture of the imaginary - time calculations starting from different initial configurations .",
    "the imaginary - time iteration has a property suitable for generating the basis to calculate the long - range correlations .",
    "it quickly removes high - energy components of the wave function in a early stage of the iteration .",
    "the s - det is expected to rapidly fall onto a potential energy surface important for low - energy modes of excitation .",
    "this is the very property we want , because we should exclude s - det s which take account of the short - range correlation in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we simply dispose all the s - det s generated in the first few hundred iterations of the imaginary - time evolution , then select s - det s after the rate of energy decrease becomes relatively slow .",
    "a series of s - det s generated with the imaginary - time calculation starting from an arbitrary initial state eventually converge to a self - consistent solution ; either the hartree - fock ground state ( path ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : itsm1 ] ) or local minima solutions ( path ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : itsm1 ] ) . during the iterations",
    ", it sometimes happens that the configuration changes very slowly and the state stays almost unchanged for a long period of the iterations ( a part presented by the dotted arrow of path ( b ) ) .",
    "this is called a shoulder state .",
    "although these shoulder states are not self - consistent solutions , they may play an important role for the low - lying excitation spectra and the ground - state correlation .",
    "we repeat the imaginary - time iteration many times starting from different initial configurations .",
    "we construct the initial s - det s by a stochastic procedure : the single - particle orbitals of the initial s - det are in a gaussian form whose centers are randomly chosen . after generating large number of imaginary - time trajectories , we may expect that those s - det s span the complete space for calculation of the long - range correlations .",
    "figure  [ fig : itsm2 ] is an example of the actual imaginary - time calculations for @xmath2o , showing the energy expectation value , @xmath25 , as a function of the iteration number , @xmath26 .",
    "the path is similar to ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : itsm1 ] , passing through a shoulder state . in @xmath27 ,",
    "the energy expectation value decreases very rapidly . from @xmath28 to 1500 , the energy decreases very slowly , corresponding to a shoulder state .",
    "we have found that this shoulder state corresponds to the cluster structure of @xmath1c+@xmath29 , which is considered as a dominant component of the first excited state of @xmath2o in the cluster model studies . the dashed and dash - dotted curves are the energy expectation value after parity projection , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "an example of the imaginary - time evolution in @xmath6 started from a randomly generated s - det .",
    "solid line indicates energy expectation value of the s - det , @xmath32 , as a function of iteration number , @xmath26 . snapshots of the density distribution at every 500 iterations are shown .",
    "the dashed and the dash - dotted line indicate energy of even and odd parity component of the s - det , respectively . the imaginary - time step of @xmath33 @xmath34mev is adopted in the calculation . ]      during the imaginary - time iterations of @xmath35 steps , s - det s for every @xmath36 iterations are taken as candidates of the basis states . thus , the s - det s at @xmath37 are nominated first .",
    "the number of s - det s taken from a single path is @xmath38 .",
    "the typical numbers are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , leading to @xmath41 .",
    "however , we can not include all these s - det s in the basis set of the configuration mixing calculation , because too many s - det s lead to a numerical instability caused by the overcompleteness .",
    "thus , we need to reduce their number . here , we impose two additional constraints on those candidates :    1 .   [ a ] @xmath42 mev .",
    "[ b ] overlap between any pair of selected s - det s must be less than 0.7 ( see below for details ) .",
    "the condition ( [ a ] ) means that the energy expectation value of each s - det , @xmath43 , should not be so large because we are interested in low - lying states and the long - range correlations only . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the cut - off energy as 30 mev above the hartree - fock ground - state energy .",
    "the second condition is directly related to the linear independence among the s - det s . in order to determine whether to include a candidate in the basis set , we examine the overlaps between the new s - det ( candidate ) and all the s - det s which have been already included in the basis set .",
    "if the maximum of the absolute values of the overlap is less than a certain value , we add the candidate to the set of basis states . since we make parity and angular momentum projection later , it is desirable to check this condition for projected wave functions .",
    "however , it costs too much to achieve angular momentum projection at this stage .",
    "instead , we examine the overlap for different configurations produced by the interchange and the inversion of the cartesian axes .",
    "these transformations correspond to 24 choices of the coordinate system , and are easily realized in the 3d cartesian coordinate representation .",
    "the condition ( [ b ] ) for adding a new s - det @xmath44 to the selected basis set @xmath45 is expressed by @xmath46 where @xmath47 are special rotations and inversions corresponding to permutation of the axes @xmath48 .    in practice",
    ", the hartree - fock state @xmath49 is always selected first .",
    "then , we start the examination of constraints ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) for generated s - det s @xmath44 in the ascending order of the energy expectation value . here , we employ not the energy expectation values with respect to the s - det , but those with respect to the states projected onto negative parity , @xmath50 .",
    "this makes it easier to select exotic deformations which often appear in the negative - parity excited states . for the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : itsm2 ] , states at @xmath51 are examined first . since those around @xmath52",
    "also show local minima in the energy surface of negative parity , they are also nominated with high priority .",
    "the number of s - det s satisfying the criteria ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) are typically from zero to three in a single trajectory of the imaginary - time evolution . apparently , larger the number of selected s - det s , @xmath53 , more difficult it becomes to find the @xmath54-th s - det to satisfy the condition ( [ b ] ) .",
    "in actual calculations , about 100 imaginary - time trajectories will be repeatedly generated to obtain about fifty s - det s which satisfy these conditions .",
    "for each s - det in a set @xmath55 } which are generated and selected in sec .",
    "[ sec : s - det ] .",
    "we perform the parity and angular momentum projection .",
    "since we construct wave functions employing the 3d cartesian coordinate representation without any restrictions on the spatial symmetries , the full three - dimensional angular momentum projection is necessary .",

    "we calculate matrix elements for parity and angular momentum projected wave functions .    @xmath65    where @xmath12 and @xmath66 specifies quantum numbers for body - fixed component of the angular momentum operator . since the rotation operator commutes with the hamiltonian , we apply rotations of angles @xmath67 and @xmath68 to the ket vector @xmath64 and the rotation of @xmath29 to the bra vector @xmath69 in the practical calculations .",
    "the parity projection operator is given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the space inversion operator .",

    "for instance , for a rotation of angle @xmath29 around @xmath75-axis , @xmath76 each small - angle rotation is performed using the taylor expansion of the rotation operator ; @xmath77 where @xmath78 gives an accurate result .",
    "we usually employ @xmath79 .    the integrand of eq .",

    "we have examined the identity of the single - particle orbitals before and after rotating over @xmath83 .",
    "the overlap between these two single - particle wave functions is very close to unity , with error less than @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the error in each rotated wave function is relatively small .",
    "however , it seems that these numerical errors are accumulated during the 3d integration over euler angles , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "the numerical integration is carried out using the trapezoidal rule with the finite - number discretization .",

    "fifty slater determinants are generated in the procedure explained in sec .",

    "the eigenvalues of norm matrix @xmath90 are plotted in descending order .",
    "the left three panels show the eigenvalues when the number of grid points of the angle @xmath67 is varied from 20 to 80 while those for @xmath29 and @xmath68 are fixed at 20 . for the right panels ,",
    "we vary the number for @xmath29 and @xmath68 from 10 to 40 , being fixed at 20 for @xmath67 .",
    "the norm eigenvalues are converged for @xmath29 and @xmath68 if we adopt 15 or more grid points for their discretization .",
    "in contrast , the convergence with respect to @xmath67 is rather slow and we still have about 70 negative eigenvalues with 80 grid points .",
    "apparently , it is desirable to have larger number of grid points for the discretization of @xmath67 angle .",
    "however , we must make a compromise and sacrifice some accuracy , because the calculation for the hamiltonian kernels in eq .",
    "( [ eq : me ] ) are very demanding in the 3d rotation . in the present work ,",
    "we employ discretization of 15 grid points for @xmath29 and @xmath68 and 20 points for @xmath67 .",
    "even with this discretization , we need to evaluate 4,500 matrix elements for each pair of the s - det s .    a price of sacrificing the accuracy is a complication of solving the eigenvalue problem , due to appearance of negative norm . in sec  [ sec : mixing ] , we will explain how to cope with this difficulty .",
    "although we collect a set of linearly independent s - det s in the procedure explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : s - det ] , the linear independence is often lost after the parity and angular momentum projection . this will lead to number of eigenvalues of the norm matrix close to zero .",
    "moreover , the numerical error in the angular momentum projection even produces the negative eigenvalues . in order to solve the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : gee ] )",

    "[ fig : compare ] , excitation energies in the @xmath2o nucleus calculated with four different sets of s - det s are compared . in these four independent calculations ,",
    "different seeds for the random number were used in preparing the initial s - det s .",
    "the energies of the lowest and the next lowest states for each parity and angular momentum @xmath145 coincide to each other in reasonable accuracy .",
    "for example , negative - parity excitations of @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath137 states appear below 15 mev , and there are no other states in this energy region .",
    "the results become less reliable for higher states in each @xmath148 sector .",
    "the second @xmath149 state ( first excited @xmath149 ) appears around @xmath150 mev in all calculations . however , excitation energy of the third ( second excited ) @xmath149 state in the bottom - left panel is notably higher than the other three .",
    "the excitation energy of the second @xmath149 state is much higher than the experimental value ( 6.05 mev ) .",
    "the three negative - parity excited states with @xmath138 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , are observed at 6.13 , 7.12 , and 8.87 mev , respectively . since the bkn interaction adopted in the present work , which does not contain the spin - orbit interaction , is too simple to give a quantitative description of nuclear structure",
    ", one should not seriously take these discrepancies between the calculation and the experiment .",
    "we also perform the same examination for other nuclei discussed below , @xmath1c and @xmath3ne .",
    "the final number of basis states @xmath123 and behavior of the convergence is similar to those of @xmath2o . the comparison of results among sets of basis generated with different random numbers may provide a useful information about reliability of calculations . from these analysis , we may judge how many eigenstates in each @xmath148 sector can be trusted .    before finishing this section ,",
    "let us comment on the cut - off value of the norm eigenvalues . in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] , the energy expectation values become somewhat scattered as the norm eigenvalues , @xmath125 , approach to @xmath106 .",
    "this may be an indication of the numerical instability .",
    "in fact , if we include basis functions with @xmath151 , the configuration mixing leads to unphysical solutions .",
    "for instance , if we set a cut - off of @xmath152 , the ground state becomes completely different from the hartree - fock state and its energy is unreasonably lowered by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is most likely that this problem originates from the numerical error in evaluating the matrix elements , especially in the angular momentum projection .",

    "however , the present calculation gives a reasonable description for some excited states of light nuclei , especially for those composed of the @xmath153-closed clusters . in this section",
    ", we present calculated energy spectra of @xmath3ne and @xmath1c nuclei . in these nuclei , there appear the @xmath153-closed clusters in the ground and excited states ( @xmath29+@xmath2o for @xmath3ne and 3@xmath29 for @xmath1c ) . in this paper , we restrict our discussion on the energy spectra in these @xmath4 even - even nuclei .",
    "a detailed discussion on the structure of excited states including information on the transition matrix elements will be given in our next work employing a realistic skyrme interaction .",
    "figure  [ fig:20ne ] shows calculated energy spectra ( left panel ) and those in measurement ( right ) in @xmath3ne .",
    "it has been well - known that the @xmath154 ground state band and the @xmath155 negative - parity band starting with @xmath146 state at 5.785 mev constitute a kind of inversion doublet band of the @xmath29-@xmath2o cluster structure .",
    "this inversion doublet bands are reasonably described in our calculation . in the measurement ,",
    "the lowest negative parity band is the @xmath156 band at 4.968 mev . in our calculation , it is around 9 mev , reflecting the importance of the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath157 and @xmath158 orbitals for this excitation .",
    "we next discuss results for @xmath1c whose spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:12c ] .",
    "again , the calculation ( left panel ) is compared with measured spectra ( right ) .",
    "the calculation produce the ground state rotational band , but its moment of inertia is significantly larger than the observed values . in the negative parity , our calculation produces @xmath137 state in the lowest energy , also @xmath146 and @xmath147 states at low excitation energies .",
    "these are qualitatively in agreement with experiments . in the positive parity excited states , the calculation indicates two @xmath149 states around 10 and 12 mev .",
    "these may correspond to the measured states around 8 and 10 mev .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have reported the variation after parity projection calculation employing the bkn interaction . the angular momentum projection after variation is achieved in the calculation employing skyrme force @xcite .",
    "a part of results presented in this section coincide fairly well with these variation after parity projection calculations .",
    "this suggests that the variation after parity projection gives a dominant correlation for a certain class of states ( with clustering ) in @xmath1c and @xmath3ne .",
    "in this paper , we report our attempt to develop a new computational method to include all the long - range correlations beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "we aim at a systematic description of the ground and low - lying excited states using a mean - field hamiltonian , without assuming their structure _ a priori_.    first , we stochastically generate many slater determinants .",
    "the single - particle orbitals are expressed on the three - dimensional cartesian grid representation . in order to remove high - energy components in those states",
    ", we use the imaginary - time iteration method .",
    "the imaginary - time evolution produces many trajectories important for low - energy modes of excitation .",
    "we select some of these states to keep the linear independence .",
    "we then project them on good parity and angular momentum , and perform configuration mixing calculation .",
    "the bkn interaction is utilized to examine feasibility and difficulty of the method .",
    "we have found that there is a numerical difficulty to achieve the configuration mixing calculation .",
    "the eigenvalues of the norm matrix can be close to zero , when the selected states are overcomplete . in the practical calculations , a small numerical error in the angular momentum projection results in the occurrence of negative eigenvalues of the norm matrix .",
    "we eliminate states responsible for these zero and negative eigenvalues before solving the generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "we show calculated results for some light @xmath0 nuclei , @xmath1c , @xmath2o , and @xmath3ne . in these nuclei ,",
    "appearances of various cluster states are known in excited states .",
    "our calculation provides reasonable excitation energies for @xmath159o states of @xmath3ne and @xmath160 states of @xmath1c for which the spin - orbit interaction , which is not included in the bkn force , does not play an important role .",
    "the results calculated with different sets of random numbers are approximately identical to each other .",
    "however , the discrepancy becomes more evident for states at higher energies . in the present level of accuracy",
    ", we may predict the lowest and possibly the second lowest states in each parity and angular momentum sector .",
    "improvement in numerical accuracy , especially in the three - dimensional angular momentum projection , is desired for future work with more realistic interactions .",
