    "the compound mnge also exhibits a magnetic order - disorder phase transition which is smeared over a wide temperature range starting with the appearance of helical fluctuations below 100 k and ending with ferromagnetic nano - regions at temperatures above @xmath14 k @xcite .",
    "the temperature evolution of the magnetic structure of mn@xmath0fe@xmath1ge with @xmath15 is found to be similar to pure mnge @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive small - angle neutron scattering study of mn@xmath0fe@xmath1ge with @xmath15 revealed that the intrinsic instability , which has been observed earlier for pure mnge , is intensified by fe - doping .",

    "it is already well known that the chiral magnetic structure of mnsi and fege compounds caused by the presence of dmi in the system @xcite .",
    "however , measurements of the hall effect in mn@xmath0fe@xmath1si revealed the presence of effective rkky interaction in formation of the magnetic structure @xcite .",
    "the differences of the magnetic properties of the mnge - based compounds from mnsi and fege together with the theoretical predictions of the value of dmi constant made in @xcite imply , that the main interaction generating the magnetic structure in mnge is an effective rkky exchange @xcite .",
    "inversely to the scenario proposed for mn@xmath0fe@xmath1si , the substitution of mn by fe atoms in mnge leads to an increase of the dmi constant reducing the coupling between the second nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "this approach also explains the decrease of the wavevector @xmath8 upon fe - substitution in mn@xmath0fe@xmath1ge @xcite .",
    "another intriguing feature observed during the study of the mixed compounds mn@xmath0fe@xmath1ge and fe@xmath0co@xmath1ge is the change of magnetic chirality upon mixing the two different magnetic atoms ( mn and fe , or fe and co ) @xcite .",

    "therefore , one possibility of the evolution of magnetic structure of mn@xmath0co@xmath1ge compounds is the double flip of the chirality upon increase of @xmath9 in mn@xmath0co@xmath1ge as long as such phenomena was observed in both series of the compounds : mn@xmath0fe@xmath1ge and fe@xmath0co@xmath1ge @xcite .",
    "another option is the absence of the flip of the chiral link between structure and magnetism if the amount of 3d - electrons is not the only driving force for this effect .",
    "nevertheless , a transition from a helimagnetic dmi - based structure to a ferromagnetic state due to the domination of the cubic anisotropy over the dmi in the compound @xcite can not be excluded .    in this work we present a comprehensive study of the changes of the magnetic properties of mn@xmath0co@xmath1ge as function of the co - substitution @xmath9 within the range @xmath17 using small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) together with squid measurements .",

    "the evolution of the magnetic structure of the mn@xmath0co@xmath1ge with increase of the co content has been investigated and a continuous transition from a helical structure based on the effective rkky interaction changing to a dmi - dominated helix which finally ends up in a ferromagnetic structure has been revealed .",

    "<S> the magnetic system of the pseudobinary compound mn@xmath0co@xmath1ge has been studied using small - angle neutron scattering and squid - measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that mn@xmath0co@xmath1ge orders magnetically at low temperatures in the whole concentration range of @xmath2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> three different states of the magnetic structure have been found : a short - periodic helical state at @xmath3 , a long - periodic helical state at @xmath4 , and a ferromagnetic state at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that the relatively large helical wavevector @xmath6 nm@xmath7 is characteristic for systems with mainly ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida ( rkky ) interaction , we suggest that the short - periodic helical structure at @xmath3 is based on an effective rkky interaction . </S>",
    "<S> also the decay of @xmath8 with increasing @xmath9 is ascribed to a reduction of the interaction between second nearest neighbors and , therefore , to an increase of the influence of the dzyaloshinskiy - moriya interaction ( dmi ) . as a result of the competition between these two interactions </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase transition from a long - range ordered ( lro ) to a short - range ordered ( sro ) helical structure has been observed upon increase of the co - concentration at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> further increase of @xmath9 leads to the appearance of a double peak in the scattering profile at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from a helical structure to a ferromagnetic state found at @xmath12 is caused by the weakening of dmi as compared to the cubic anisotropy . in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the magnetic structure of mn@xmath0co@xmath1ge with increasing @xmath9 is an example of a continuous transition from a helical structure based on the effective rkky interaction to a ferromagnetic structure passing through a helical structure based on dmi . </S>"
