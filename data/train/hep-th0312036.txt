    "during the recent decades it has become clear that spontaneous symmetry breaking and related with it topological defects play important role in physics of superfluid helium , superconductors , liquid crystals , hadronic matter , cosmic objects like neutron stars or hypothetical cosmic strings , and many other systems .",
    "reviews and references can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "static properties of the topological defects are understood relatively well .",
    "dynamics of them is much harder to unravel .",
    "interactions and production of the defects in general involve many modes of underlying fields ( or order parameters ) , and non - trivial time - dependent solutions of nonlinear field equations have to be investigated .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss time - dependent solutions in the effective model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the model is distinguished by several attractive features .",
    "first , the pertinent field equations are very simple .",
    "second , the model has clear relation with a classical system of macroscopic pendulums , which is easy to visualize , and even to build .",
    "this is in contrast with many other effective models with topological defects where their relation with the pertinent physical system is not transparent  this is especially true in the case of classical ginzburg - landau type effective models for quantum fluids .",
    "finally , the topological defects in our model have only contact interactions",
    " they do not interact until they touch each other .",
    "the reason is that solutions describing the defects exactly coincide with vacuum solutions outside certain finite region in the space , hence the common exponential tails are absent here .",
    "such defects are called compactons .",
    "the lagrangian obtained in @xcite has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a dimensionless coordinate along a straight - line , @xmath5 is the scalar field which in general can depend on @xmath6 and on a dimensionless time @xmath7 .",
    "the field potential @xmath8 is given by the following formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant , @xmath11 .",
    "the potential has two degenerate minima at @xmath12 , see fig .",
    "+    fig.1 . the potential @xmath8 .",
    "the variable @xmath4 is restricted to the interval @xmath13.$ ] by assumption , the field @xmath14 obeys the following boundary conditions @xmath15 because of the infinite potential barrier , modulus of the field @xmath14 can not exceed @xmath16 @xmath17 scalar fields with values restricted to certain finite interval appear also in a completely different context of brane models , @xcite .    as discussed in detail in @xcite ,",
    "the effective model defined by formulas ( 1 - 4 ) describes a system of @xmath18 pendulums attached to a rectilinear wire at the constant distance @xmath19 between them .",
    "each pendulum has the arm of length @xmath20 , and mass @xmath21 on the free end which can move only in a plane perpendicular to the wire .",
    "@xmath14 is the angle between the arm and the vertical upward direction .",
    "the pendulums are firmly attached to the wire , so that @xmath14 is also the angle by which the wire is twisted .",
    "it is assumed that the wire is elastic with respect to the twists , @xmath22 is the corresponding torsional elasticity coefficient .",
    "the angle @xmath14 is restricted to the interval @xmath23 $ ] by two stiff rods placed symmetrically on both sides of the wire , parallel to it and at the appropriate distance .",
    "the boundary conditions ( 3 ) mean that the two outermost pendulums are kept at rest in the upward position by an external force .",
    "the dimensionless variables @xmath24 are related to the physical position coordinate @xmath25 ( along the wire ) and time @xmath26 by the formulas @xmath27 the two outermost pendulums are located at @xmath28 hence @xmath29    the system of pendulums as described above , but without the two rods , is well - known in connection with sine - gordon equation and its solitonic solutions @xcite . in that case",
    "the space of values of @xmath30 is a circle @xmath31 , and the solitons appear because of nontrivial topology of @xmath31 . in our case , instead of @xmath31 we have the topologically trivial interval @xmath23.$ ] the presence of compactons is due to spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 symmetry @xmath32 it takes place when @xmath33 becomes large enough , see section 3 .",
    "yet another system of coupled pendulums is described in @xcite .",
    "it differs from the sine - gordon or our system by the presence of a term which represents nonlinear elasticity of the wire , and from our system also by absence of the rods .",
    "thanks to the nonlinear elasticity the solitons are compactons .",
    "they essentially differ from the ones discussed by us .    in @xcite",
    "we have discussed in detail the relation between the system of pendulums and the field - theoretic model with lagrangian ( 1 ) , as well as basic properties of compactons : their shape and energy . in the present paper",
    "we investigate waves propagating in the ground state with broken @xmath0 symmetry , and we make a preliminary study of production of compactons and anti - compactons during the @xmath0 symmetry breaking transition .",
    "such transition can be triggered by , for example , decreasing the elasticity coefficient @xmath22 or by increasing the length @xmath20 of the arm .",
    "both possibilities seem technically feasible . the first topic is discussed in section 2 .",
    "it is interesting because the standard procedure , based on linearization of field equations , does not work here  potential ( 2 ) is not smooth at the absolute minima .",
    "it turns out that even in the limit of small amplitudes the pertinent evolution equation remains nonlinear . as for the second topic , it is related to the broad subject of dynamics of rapid phase transitions and production of topological defects @xcite .",
    "we show in section 3 that thanks to extraordinary simplicity of our model one can calculate time evolution of the system during the symmetry breaking transition .",
    "in particular , one can see how many topological defects are produced .",
    "in this section we consider an infinite chain of pendulums , @xmath34 and we abandon the boundary conditions ( 3 ) .",
    "the main reason for this step is that we would like to study effects which are due to the infinite potential barrier at @xmath35 at the ends of the finite chain the barrier is not felt at all because of condition ( 3 ) .",
    "the evolution equation which corresponds to lagrangian ( 1 ) has the form @xmath36 if @xmath37 when @xmath14 reaches @xmath38 the pendulums elastically bounce from the rods , @xmath39 or just rest on them if the velocity vanishes .",
    "let us emphasize that eq.(8 ) does not hold when @xmath40    in the present paper we assume that the maximal angle @xmath10 is small and therefore @xmath41 this can be achieved by putting the rods close enough to the pendulums when they are in the upward vertical position .",
    "then , eq.(8 ) is linearized @xmath42    for the infinite chain of pendulums the two degenerate ground states are given by @xmath43 evolution of small perturbations of the ground state @xmath10 is governed by eq.(11 ) and the reflection condition ( 9 ) .",
    "such perturbations have the form of waves propagating along the chain : the pendulums rise a little bit above the rod and fall back .",
    "we assume that amplitudes of the waves , equal to @xmath44 are not too large , @xmath45 that is that none of the pendulums reaches the upward vertical position .",
    "condition ( 13 ) is of course equivalent to @xmath46 in order to investigate the waves we use the following trick . instead of the original field @xmath47 we consider another one , namely @xmath48 related to @xmath49 by the formula @xmath50 condition ( 13 ) means that @xmath51 equation ( 11 ) is equivalent to the following evolution equation for @xmath52 @xmath53 the r.h.s . of this equation for @xmath54",
    "corresponds to the potential @xmath55 given by the following formula @xmath56 @xmath55 is symmetric with respect to the point @xmath57 at which it reaches its absolute minimum , @xmath58 see fig .",
    "2 . equation ( 16 ) gives continuous evolution of @xmath52 and of its first derivatives @xmath59 .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath52 instead of @xmath14 is that because of relation ( 14 ) such continuous evolution of @xmath60 automatically gives the reflection ( 9 ) of @xmath61 at @xmath62    fig.2 .",
    "the potential @xmath63    because we are interested in oscillations of @xmath52 around @xmath10 , we substitute @xmath64 evolution equation for @xmath65 follows from eq.(16 ) , @xmath66 ( we assume that @xmath67 condition ( 15 ) is equivalent to @xmath68 solutions of eq.(18 ) describing running periodic waves can be obtained with the help of the ansatz @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the phase velocity of the wave .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath71 now equation ( 18 ) is reduced to ordinary differential equation @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes @xmath74 .",
    "integration of eq.(21 ) gives the relation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the maximal value of @xmath65 .",
    "hence , @xmath77 the sign @xmath78 or @xmath79 should be chosen in accordance with the sign of @xmath80 because the r.h.s .",
    "of ( 22 ) is nonnegative .",
    "we consider eq.(22 ) in the regions @xmath81 and @xmath82 separately .",
    "simple calculations show that if @xmath83 then @xmath84 , respectively , where @xmath85 @xmath86 here @xmath87 are constants .",
    "these two solutions should match each other at @xmath88 such that @xmath89 thus , @xmath90 and @xmath91 these conditions are satisfied if @xmath92 where @xmath93 it turns out that at such @xmath94 also the first derivatives of @xmath95 are equal .",
    "@xmath96 is non - negative in the interval @xmath97 $ ] , and @xmath98 is non - positive on the interval @xmath99 $ ] . taken together they give @xmath65 in the interval @xmath100 $ ] , and @xmath65 for all other values of @xmath101 can be obtained by periodic repeating @xmath102 and @xmath103 , see fig.3 .",
    "thus , we have obtained the running periodic wave of the @xmath104 type .",
    "fig.3 . the periodic wave of the cosh type .",
    "it is clear that @xmath105 is the wave length for @xmath106 .",
    "the periodicity in @xmath101 implies periodicity in @xmath4 with the wave length @xmath107 and in @xmath7 with the period @xmath108 the corresponding wave number @xmath109 and the frequency @xmath110 obey the relation @xmath111 the group velocity of this wave @xmath112 is smaller that 1 . because the r.h.s . of formula",
    "( 27 ) does not vanish , the waves are massive . for fixed wave number @xmath113",
    "the group velocity increases with @xmath105 . according to formula ( 26 )",
    "@xmath105 increases with @xmath114 therefore , the waves with larger amplitude are faster .",
    "this dependence on the amplitude appears because eq.(21 ) is nonlinear .",
    "due to the discontinuous character of the @xmath115 function it can not be linearized even for arbitrarily small @xmath65  in our system even arbitrarily small oscillations around the ground state are nonlinear .",
    "in this section we consider the finite chain of pendulums , @xmath116 @xmath117 obeys the boundary conditions ( 3 ) .",
    "we again assume that @xmath10 is small enough to justify the approximation ( 10 ) . in order to simplify the model further",
    ", we now assume that the dynamics of pendulums is dissipative , that is that the pertinent evolution equation has the form @xmath118 instead of ( 11 ) ( if @xmath119 physically this can be achieved by putting the chain of pendulums in a viscous liquid . in the present case",
    "the second of formulas ( 6 ) , relating the @xmath7 variable with the physical time @xmath120 is replaced by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a constant coefficient characterizing the friction .",
    "the main advantage of such over - damped system is that by quickly loosing its energy it rapidly evolves towards a stable state .    if the chain of pendulums is long enough , that is if @xmath123 as shown below , there are two degenerate ground states given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 ,   \\\\   \\phi_0 & \\mbox{for } & \\xi \\in [ -\\xi_n + \\frac{\\pi}{2 } , \\xi_n - \\frac{\\pi}{2 } ] ,   \\\\   \\phi_0 \\sin ( \\xi_n - \\xi ) & \\mbox{for } & \\xi \\in [ \\xi_n - \\frac{\\pi}{2 } , \\xi_n ] .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] such @xmath126 obeys the boundary condition ( 3 ) .",
    "the sinus functions are solutions of eq.(28 )  they describe gradually tilted pendulums . for the intermediate values of @xmath4 , that is when @xmath127 the pendulums just rest on one rod . for the chains shorter than @xmath128",
    "formula for @xmath126 given above can not be accepted .",
    "below we show that in this case the stable ground state is given by @xmath129 this state is symmetric with respect to the @xmath0 transformation ( 5 ) .",
    "the static compacton is obtained from the ground state @xmath130 by flipping pendulums from one rod to the other one at the intermediate values of @xmath4 .",
    "this flip is given by the static solution of eq.(28 ) , @xmath131 in the interval @xmath132 the compacton is located at @xmath133 and it has the width @xmath128 . notice that the sinus functions present in formula ( 29 ) can be regarded as half - compacton and half - anticompacton sitting at the ends of the wire .",
    "if the compacton is present , at the ends we have two half - anticompactons",
    ". the compacton does not interact with these half - anticompactons if it is located far enough from the ends , namely if @xmath134    solutions of eq.(28 ) can be written in the form of decomposition into eigenmodes @xmath135 where @xmath136 @xmath137 let us recall that @xmath49 evolves according to equation ( 28 ) until a pendulum touches one of the rods .",
    "therefore , solution ( 32 ) is physically relevant until @xmath138 at certain @xmath4 and @xmath7 . at later times",
    "the description of the evolution of the system has to take into account the reflection condition ( 9 ) .",
    "obviously , formulas ( 32 - 34 ) correctly describe evolution of small deviations from the @xmath0 symmetric state @xmath139 in the case when this state is unstable , these formulas are relevant if @xmath7 is in certain finite interval @xmath140.$ ] if that state is stable , @xmath141 , the formulas describe exponential disappearance of small perturbations when @xmath142 of course , in any case we have to take the coefficients @xmath143 small enough .",
    "formulas ( 33 - 34 ) show that the modes with @xmath144 exponentially disappear , while the modes with @xmath145 exponentially grow . because the smallest value of @xmath146 is equal to 1 ,",
    "all modes exponentially disappear if @xmath147 .",
    "this means that the @xmath0 symmetric solution @xmath148 is stable . in this case",
    "@xmath33 is too small to allow for appearance of the half - compacton + half - anticompacton pair at the ends of the chain .",
    "let us remark here that such clear cut division into the two possibilities is an artifact of the approximation ( 10 ) .",
    "as shown in @xcite , in the case the compacton is obtained from eq.(8 ) without this approximation , its width depends on @xmath10 and it approaches @xmath128 when @xmath149 ( the difference vanishes as @xmath150 ) .",
    "therefore , in the real system @xmath151 larger than @xmath152 still can be too small to accomodate the half - compactons at the ends . in such intermediate case certain unstable modes @xmath153 are present but in the final static and stable configuration the pendulums are tilted towards one of the rods but",
    "do not reach it .",
    "the value of @xmath33 can be regulated by changing @xmath22 .",
    "it turns out that evolution of the system can be investigated analytically also when @xmath22 is time - dependent , @xmath154 this is particularly interesting when @xmath22 is changed from a large value @xmath155 to a small value @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the critical value of the elasticity coefficient at which the first unstable mode appears and the symmetric state looses its stability .",
    "first , we return to the physical position variable @xmath25 because it is independent of @xmath22 , see the first of formulas ( 6 )  equation ( 28 ) is written in the following form @xmath158 where @xmath159.$ ] let us write @xmath160 in the form of fourier series @xmath161 equation ( 35 ) implies that @xmath162 where @xmath163 the dot denotes @xmath164 equations ( 37 ) can be integrated also when @xmath165 @xmath166    let consider in detail the transition which begins at the moment @xmath167 and such that @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the constant rate of change of the elasticity coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "hence , @xmath170 in this case formula ( 39 ) gives @xmath171 when @xmath172 while at later times @xmath173    formula ( 41 ) implies that @xmath146-th mode begins to grow at @xmath174 where @xmath175 however , one has to add the restriction @xmath176 because for larger times formula ( 41 ) is not relevant .",
    "this restriction implies that in fact only modes with @xmath177 become unstable , where @xmath178 because @xmath179 and @xmath180 @xmath181 the term with @xmath182 in formula ( 36 ) describes pendulums which are tilted to one of the rods only  this mode does not give @xmath183 at any point except the ends .",
    "therefore , this mode can not lead to appearance of the kinks .",
    "hence , right during the transition , ie .",
    "when @xmath172 no compactons and anti - compactons are produced .    during the second stage of evolution of the system , when @xmath184 formula ( 42 ) should be used .",
    "it predicts that the number of growing modes remains constant , and that it is bounded from above by @xmath185 where @xmath186 it is clear that @xmath187 and that @xmath188 becomes arbitrarily large if @xmath189 is smaller and smaller .",
    "below we argue that @xmath188 gives the upper bound on the produced compacton - anticompacton pairs .",
    "notice that it does not depend on @xmath190 .",
    "also the magnitude of @xmath191 or equivalently @xmath192 , is not relevant in this respect .    according to formula ( 36 ) each mode evolves independently .",
    "therefore , the presence or absence of a given mode is determined by the initial data specifying @xmath193 .",
    "if only a single growing mode @xmath194 is present , its amplitude grows monotonically until the pendulums touch one of the rods .",
    "if the friction is very large , one may expect that they will not be able to bounce back over the energy barrier at @xmath195 and to fall on the other rod .",
    "therefore , in such over - damped case the total number of produced compactons and anti - compactons is equal to @xmath196 this number does not include the half-(anti)compactons which appear at the ends of the chain .",
    "the number of compactons may differ by 1 from the number of anti - compactons  in such a case the total topological charge is made equal to zero ( which is its initial value ) by the two halves at the ends .",
    "for example , if a single compacton is present , at both ends there are two half - anticompactons .",
    "thus , in the over - damped case the total number of produced compactons and anti - compactons is not larger that @xmath197 , and it does not depend neither on the initial value of @xmath22 nor on the rate @xmath198 of the transition .",
    "the actual number of produced kinks is determined by the initial data @xmath193 .",
    "formula ( 41 ) shows that the value of @xmath199 increases with increasing value of the rate @xmath198 of the transition if @xmath200 , and decreases if @xmath201 , where @xmath202 it is clear that @xmath203 because evolution of the modes at times larger than @xmath192 does not depend on @xmath198 , this means that the unstable modes with @xmath204 have larger amplitudes if the transition is rapid .",
    "then , these modes reach the angles @xmath38 earlier than in the case of a slower transition with the same initial perturbation .",
    "the opposite happens for the modes with @xmath205 thus , the magnitude of @xmath198 has influence on the time of arrival at the final state after the transition .",
    "one can develop another approach to studying the waves propagating in the ground state @xmath10 ( section 2 ) by first smoothing the potential @xmath8 at @xmath206 , then applying the standard approach , and removing the regularization in the end .",
    "the essential difficulty with this approach is that in order to obtain waves of non - vanishing amplitude after returning to the original potential @xmath8 one has to consider waves with finite amplitudes in the regularized potential , and such waves probe nonlinearity of the regularized potential .",
    "therefore , this approach is in fact more cumbersome than the one adopted in section 2 .",
    "\\2 . it is tempting to compare our results on production of the kinks with the well - known phenomenological predictions for the number of produced topological defects during phase transitions in condensed matter systems , see @xcite for reviews and references , where a strong dependence on the rate of the transition is expected , and actually seen in various numerical simulations and actual experiments . on the other hand , our explicit calculations of that number",
    "give results which do not show such dependence .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that we have tackled only the case of very special initial perturbations : the ones with a single eigen - mode present .",
    "clearly , studies of this aspect of the model should be continued by considering more generic initial states .",
    "another topic which deserves a separate study is interaction of compactons , e.g. , their scattering .",
    "preliminary investigations reveal a rich dynamics which includes emission of radiation and breather - like states .",
    "one more interesting aspect not discussed here is interaction of the waves and the kinks with the boundaries at @xmath207 . recently",
    "a study of such interactions in another model has appeared @xcite .",
