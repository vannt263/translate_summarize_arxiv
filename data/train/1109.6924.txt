    "power - law cosmology finds a reasonable place in the literature to address some common problems ( e.g. , age problem , flatness problem , horizon problem etc . ) associated with the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model based on big bang theory .",

    "the motivation for such an endeavor is followed by a number of considerations .",
    "for instance , power - law cosmological models with @xmath17 do not encounter the horizon problem at all ( sethi , dev & jain 2005 ) .",
    "these models do not witness the flatness problem since the matter density is not constrained by the scale factor . in these models ,",
    "age of the universe turns out at least fifty percent greater than the age predicted by the scdm model .",
    "this bridges the gap between the age of the universe and the age estimates of globular clusters and high - z redshift galaxies , and thus the age problem is alleviated .",
    "sethi , dev & jain ( 2005 ) showed that an open linear coasting cosmological model constrained with type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) `` gold '' sample and ages of old quasars accommodates a very old high - redshift quasar , which the scdm model fails to do .",
    "the linear coasting cosmology is found to be consistent with the gravitational lensing statistics ( dev et al .",

    ", there have been numerous attempts to estimate the value of @xmath0 .",

    "a recent estimate of the hubble constant , which used a new infrared camera on the hst to measure the distance and redshift for a collection of astronomical objects , gives a value of @xmath24 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ( riess et al . 2011 ) .",

    "<S> in this paper , we show that the expansion history of the universe in power - law cosmology essentially depends on two crucial parameters , namely the hubble constant @xmath0 and deceleration parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find the constraints on these parameters from the latest @xmath2 and sne ia data . at 1@xmath3 level </S>",
    "<S> the constraints from @xmath2 data are obtained as @xmath4 and @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 while the constraints from the sne ia data read as @xmath7 and @xmath8 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform the joint test using @xmath2 and sne ia data , which yields the constraints @xmath9 and @xmath10 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates of @xmath0 are found to be in close agreement with some recent probes carried out in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reveals that the observational data successfully describe the cosmic acceleration within the framework of power - law cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the power - law cosmology accommodates well the @xmath2 and sne ia data . </S>",
    "<S> we also test the power - law cosmology using the primordial nucleosynthesis , which yields the constraints @xmath11 and @xmath12 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints are found to be inconsistent with the ones derived from the @xmath2 and sne ia data . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out the statefinder analysis , and find that the power - law cosmological models approach the standard @xmath13cdm model as @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we conclude that despite having several good features power - law cosmology is not a complete package for the cosmological purposes .     </S>",
