    "the precise study of the nucleon spin structure has evolved over the last years into a broad field allowing to test many aspects of qcd .",
    "the surprising emc  @xcite result , that the quarks carry only a small fraction of the nucleon spin , has been confirmed by new high precision measurements .",
    "this dramatic improvement in quality of the data and theoretical analysis has lead to a generally accepted range of polarised parton distribution parametrizations which imply that the quarks carry only about 30% of the nucleon spin .",
    "nearly all models predict a substantial polarisation for both the gluons and the strange quarks which has to be confirmed by direct experimental tests before the present standard interpretation of the data can be regarded as established .",
    "the polarised gluon distribution is of special interest since it could be surprisingly large .    in the next to leading order ( nlo ) evolution equations the quark and gluon distributions mix , hence polarised gluons also contribute to @xmath6 .",
    "the quality of the present @xmath7 data allow for qcd fits to be made , and @xmath8 to be extracted .",
    "the precision is however rather poor , and only some information on the first moment on @xmath8 is obtained .",
    "therefore the hunting of @xmath8 by direct measurements is one of the key issues in polarised scattering physics for the next foreseeable future .",
    "the unpolarised gluon distribution has been studied at the @xmath1 collider hera .",
    "the large centre of mass energy ( @xmath9 ) gev , resulting from 27.5 gev electrons colliding with 820 gev protons , allows for several techniques to be used .",
    "so far the gluon distribution at hera has been accessed via scaling violations of @xmath10 , di - jet production , charm production and exclusive vector meson production . while the first method gives an indirect measurement of the gluon , like for the nlo analysis of @xmath7 , for the other methods the gluon enters directly at the born level . in this paper",
    "we will use the method of extracting the gluon via di - jet events rates .    in lo",
    "two diagrams can lead to di - jet events , shown in fig .  1 .",
    "these are the photon - gluon fusion process ( pgf ) and the qcd - compton process ( qcdc ) .",
    "the pgf process is directly sensitive to the gluon density , while the qcdc process is sensitive to the quark densities and constitutes the background .",
    "the h1 collaboration has performed an analysis of di - jets to extract the pgf contribution and thus the gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "presently both the h1 an zeus collaborations attempt to extract the gluon distribution at nlo from di - jets event rates  @xcite .",
    "if both beams at hera would be polarised , this method could be used to extract @xmath8 . due to the sokolov - ternov effect",
    "the electron beam gets transversely polarised in the machine .",
    "spin rotators can flip transverse into longitudinal polarisation , which is more useful for physics studies .",
    "the only possibility for a polarised proton beam at hera is to start from a polarised source and accelerate and store the beam , keeping the polarisation on the way  @xcite .",
    "first feasibility studies indicate the possibility of such a scenario in case the accelerators get upgraded with partial and full siberian snakes . for this report",
    "it is assumed that a polarisation of 70% can be reached for both beams , and that the luminosity will be as large as for the unpolarised case ( roughly 200 to 500 pb@xmath5 , integrated over several years )    first studies on extracting @xmath11 from di - jet event rates were made in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we make a full monte carlo simulation of the signal and background processes , include hadronisation , higher order effects via parton showers , and detector effects .",
    "starting from three different sets of polarised gluon distributions , shown in fig .  2",
    ", we check the sensitivity of the measurements and extract @xmath0 .",
    "these distributions are the gehrmann - stirling ( gs ) sets a and c  @xcite , which result from a qcd analysis of @xmath7 data , and the instanton - gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "the latter results from a calculation of the polarised parton distribution in the instanton liquid model  @xcite .",
    "the distributions shown in fig .  2 , purposely selected , indicate how poorly @xmath0 is constrained by the present polarised data .",
    "all of these distributions are compatible with the available data , stressing the need for direct measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "the gs - a and gs - c distribution show a similar small @xmath2 behaviour , but differ considerably in the region around @xmath12 .",
    "the gs - c distribution is negative for this @xmath2 region .",
    "the instanton - gluon is quite different from the gs sets .",
    "it remains negative over the full @xmath2 range .",
    "the latter gluon is used in combination with the gs - a quark distributions for the study in this paper . for the unpolarised parton density functions",
    "the parametrizations of glck , reya and vogt in lo were used  @xcite .",
    "deep inelastic electron - proton scattering with several partons in the final state , @xmath13 proceeds via the exchange of an intermediate vector boson @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15-exchange and @xmath16 interference become only important at large @xmath17 ( @xmath18 gev@xmath19 ) and are neglected in the following .",
    "we denote the momentum of the incoming proton by @xmath20 , the momentum of the virtual photon , @xmath21 , by @xmath22 , ( minus ) its absolute square by @xmath17 , and use the standard scaling variables bjorken-@xmath2 @xmath23 and inelasticity @xmath24 .",

    "the photon - gluon fusion subprocess @xmath40 dominates the di - jet cross section at low bjorken-@xmath2 for unpolarised protons ( see below ) and allows for a direct measurement of the gluon density in the proton .",
    "the full nlo corrections for di - jet production in unpolarised lepton - hadron scattering are implemented in the @xmath41 event generator mepjet  @xcite which allows to analyse arbitrary jet definition schemes and general cuts in terms of parton 4-momenta .",
    "recently , mepjet has been extended to nlo for polarised scattering  @xcite , and the nlo qcd corrections are found to be moderate . + in lo the total unpolarised di - jet cross section is the sum of the contributions from photon gluon fusion processes , @xmath42 and qcd - compton scattering , @xmath43 and can be written as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the gluon and quark densities and @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be calculated in perturbative qcd . similarly , for the polarised case we can write :",

    "@xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the experimentally accessible asymmetry @xmath56 is smaller than @xmath57 due to the incomplete polarisations of the electron and proton beams , given by @xmath58 , and the depolarisation of the @xmath59 with respect to the electron .",
    "the latter effect is described by the depolarisation factor @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the inelasticity and @xmath62 is the ratio of longitudinal and transverse @xmath63 cross sections . @xmath64",
    "the quantities @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) are the total number of observed di - jet events ( @xmath67 ) for the case that proton and electron spin are antiparallel ( parallel ) , respectively . the kinematic quantities to describe the pgf process are the momentum fraction of the proton carried by the gluon @xmath68 , the four - momentum transfer @xmath17 and the square of the invariant mass of the two jets @xmath69 . they are related to the bjorken-@xmath2 , @xmath2 , by : @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and in the @xmath17 range relevant for hera of @xmath72  gev@xmath73 , @xmath68 is larger than bjorken-@xmath2 by about an order of magnitude and the accessible range at hera is therefore about @xmath74 .",
    "h1 has demonstrated that in this region the unpolarised gluon density @xmath75 can be extracted from di - jet cross sections  @xcite .",
    "+ the program mepjet has been used to study di - jet production in ( un)polarised dis at ( n)lo at the level of parton - jets  @xcite . to perform a study for a possible future measurement it is , however , desirable to include also hadronisation and detector effects . therefore in this study we use the monte carlo event generator program pepsi  6.5  @xcite .",
    "it is a full , lo lepton - nucleon scattering monte carlo program based on lepto 6.5  @xcite for unpolarised and polarised interactions , including fragmentation , and unpolarised parton showers to simulate higher order effects .",
    "a comparison of pepsi and mepjet , used with identical conditions and cuts , shows that , at parton level , both programs give very similar results for di - jet cross sections and asymmetries for the hera kinematic range  @xcite .",

    "the kinematic range was restricted to @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the minimum @xmath17 was varied from 2  gev@xmath19 ( plots on the left ) to 5  gev@xmath19 ( plots on the right ) . in pepsi",
    "the so - called @xmath79 recombination scheme  @xcite has been used to define the phase space available for the lo matrix elements .",
    "the parameters for this scheme , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , were chosen such that the phase space region for di - jet events using a cone jet scheme for di - jets with @xmath82  gev and @xmath71 was not affected .",
    "@xmath83 is the minimum of @xmath84 for the two jet momenta @xmath85 in a di - jet event .",
    "the variable @xmath86 is defined via @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the momentum of the incoming quark . for the jet detection",
    "a cone jet algorithm was used with @xmath89 , @xmath90 being the minimal distance which two partons must have in order to belong to different jets .",
    "@xmath62 is given by : @xmath91 with @xmath92 being the pseudo rapidity and @xmath93 being the azimuthal angle in the laboratory frame .",
    "the two upper plots show the asymmetries for events with @xmath94 , for the two lower plots @xmath95 .",
    "the division into two @xmath69 bins was made , because studies for the unpolarised di - jet cross sections  @xcite have shown that nlo corrections are expected to be small above @xmath96 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a study was made to further optimize the cuts in order to get a better sensitivity to @xmath8 .",
    "they concluded that the cuts used in this analysis are already very close to the optimum choice .",
    "recently , some disagreement at low @xmath17 has been reported between the newly , more precise , measured jet cross sections and the nlo calculations at hera , using the cone jet algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may hint towards a resolved photon component in the data , and is presently under study .",
    "we expect however that at the time the measurement described in this paper can be made , this matter will be settled and will have the effect of an additional small background to be subtracted from the di - jet event rates , in order to access the gluon distribution .",
    "we present a detailed study using the pepsi program on the expected size of the measurable asymmetries for di - jet production at hera .",
    "we show the influence of parton showers , which simulate higher order effects , and hadronisation and detector effects .",
    "we also show the sensitivity of the measurement to different polarised gluon distributions .",
    "the kinematic cuts applied for this study are similar to the ones discussed in the previous section , @xmath97  gev@xmath19 and @xmath98 . again",
    "two bins of @xmath69 were analysed with @xmath99  gev@xmath19 and @xmath100  gev@xmath19 , respectively .",
    "jets are defined using the cone scheme , are required to have a @xmath101  gev and are restricted to the acceptance of a typical existing hera detector by @xmath102 , were @xmath103 is the pseudo - rapidity in the laboratory system . the expected measurable asymmetry for the input polarised gluon density gs - a , assuming the beam polarisations @xmath104 and 200  pb@xmath5 for the luminosity , is shown in fig .  [ fig - asy - ph]a at the parton level .",
    "the expected asymmetry is negative and of the order of a few @xmath105 .",
    "jets induced by parton showers tend to reduce the size of the asymmetry .",
    "this is due to the fact that parton showers can produce a hard jet , which is then misidentified as a pgf induced one .",
    "this , rather small reduction on parton level , is more pronounced , if hadronisation and detector smearing effects are included ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - asy - ph]b ) .",
    "the reason for this is that both effects broaden the jets and therefore the measured @xmath106 which is related to the energy in the cone of fixed size is smaller than the @xmath106 of the parton jet .",
    "the reconstruction of the kinematics of the event ( @xmath69 , @xmath68 ) is influenced and the correlation with the parton jets is reduced . for the hadronisation",
    "the lund fragmentation model , implemented in jetset  @xcite , was used and an energy resolution for the hadronic calorimeter of @xmath107}$ ] was assumed .",
    "the results were cross checked using a realistic simulation program of the h1 calorimeter  @xcite , which takes into account the energy resolution , the absolute energy scale and dead material in the detector . in order to optimize the signal to background ratio cuts were introduced demanding the two jets to be produced with a restricted difference in pseudo - rapidity and back to back in azimuth , as it is expected for real pgf events : @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "after all these cuts for 100  pb@xmath5 about 70,000 di - jet events are selected .",
    "the ratio of qcdc - pgf events is in the order of 1:6 .",
    "the average @xmath17 of this event sample is very close to 20  gev@xmath73 therefore results for @xmath8 are presented at this value .",
    "+ all cuts are applied in the asymmetry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - asy - ph]b .",
    "although the asymmetries are smaller due to the parton showers , and the statistics is reduced compared to the result on parton level , the expected asymmetry is still large enough to allow a statistically significant measurement for 200  pb@xmath5 .",
    "these asymmetries form the basis of the studies in this paper . due to the split - up in the @xmath69-bins , for the second and third @xmath68 bin",
    "there are two measurements . for simplicity",
    "we choose in the following one measurement per @xmath68-bin , i.e.  the one with the better significance .",
    "however , in principal the other points could be used as well , and add to the statistical significance .",
    "table  [ tab - asys ] shows the expected asymmetries @xmath56 and their statistical errors @xmath110 for the six @xmath68-bins shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - asy - ph ] . the two lowest @xmath68-bins correspond to @xmath99  gev@xmath19 . also shown is @xmath111 which is defined as @xmath112 and corresponds to the first term in the sum of eq .",
    "[ eq - a ] , which is the part sensitive to @xmath113 in other words , it is the measured asymmetry corrected for the qcdc contribution .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the first moments of all the gehrmann - stirling sets are very similar ( 2.6 , 2.6 , and 2.5 at @xmath114 for the sets a , b , c , respectively , and 1.8 for grsvs ) . the shape of @xmath0 , however , can be very different , which shows the importance of this kind of measurement with respect to e.g. extractions of the first moment of @xmath8 in a nlo - qcd analysis of the polarised structure function @xmath7 .",
    "however , since these two approaches give rather complementary information it could be advantageous to combine the di - jet analysis and the nlo fits to @xmath7 into a common fit .",
    "a case study of such an analysis for a polarised hera has been performed  @xcite . +",
    "another point to stress here is that for all four parametrizations the part of the first moment @xmath115 which can be measured with the di - jet events is 60% for gs - c and about 75% for gs - a , gs - b , grsvs of the total first moment @xmath116 . as an example , assuming gs - a , in this experiment we would measure @xmath117 , hence a 10% uncertainty for the first moment in the measured range .    to show that more information could be extracted , fig .",

    "it shows that such analysis can provide direct information on the interesting question on the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "we have shown in this study that an analysis of the di - jet rate at hera allows a measurement of @xmath119 in an @xmath2-range from @xmath4 , a region where large differences are observed between present models for the polarised gluon distribution .",
    "this @xmath2 range is largely uncovered by any other proposed experiment .",
    "the precision of the measurement , both statistical and systematical , is large enough such that shape of @xmath52 could be measured and discrimination between different polarised gluon distributions would be possible .",
    "the first moment of @xmath8 can be determined with a precision of about 10% , in the range @xmath120 the results are complimentary to extractions of the first moment of @xmath8 from structure function measurements , and measurements at compass  @xcite , rhic or hera-@xmath121 .",
