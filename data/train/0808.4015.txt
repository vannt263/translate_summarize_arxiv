    "we will show in  [ sec : opt ] that both these components are optical alignments that are not gravitationally bound to the @xmath8  crb system . finally , wds component e ( @xmath8  crb  c , hip 79551 ) which was resolved 635@xmath10 away at 241@xmath11  in 1991 by _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite , was identified as a photocentric - motion binary by @xcite .",
    "the parallax and proper motion listed for this star in @xcite , the improved _ hipparcos _ results based on a new reduction of the raw data , match the corresponding measures for @xmath0  crb within the errors , confirming a physical association .",
    "sr03 presented photometric evidence in support of a rotation period of 1.157 @xmath1 0.002 days for both components of @xmath0  crb , the central pair of this system .",
    "they explained the 0.017-day difference between the rotation and orbital periods as differential surface rotation .",
    "@xcite estimated an orbital inclination of 28@xmath11 , assuming component masses of 1.2 @xmath2  based on spectral types .",
    "sr03 subsequently adopted this inclination to obtain component masses of 1.108 @xmath1 0.004 @xmath2  and 1.080 @xmath1 0.004 @xmath2 , but these masses are based on circular reasoning , and the errors are underestimated as they ignore the uncertainty in inclination .",
    "several spectroscopic orbits have been published for this pair ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; sr03 ) , enabling the spectroscopic orbital elements to be well - constrained .",
    "we present an updated spectroscopic solution based on these prior data and our own radial velocity measurements (  [ sec : historical ] ,  [ sec : specorb ] ) .",
    "our visual orbit leverages these spectroscopic solutions and derives all orbital elements for this binary (  [ sec : visualorbit ] ) , leading to accurate component masses (  [ sec : massest ] ) .",
    "this work utilizes a very precise parallax measure for this radio - emitting binary obtained by @xcite using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "their parallax of 43.93 @xmath1 0.10 mas is about 10 times more precise than the _ hipparcos _ catalog value of 46.11 @xmath1 0.98 mas and 12 times more precise than the @xcite measure of 47.35 @xmath1 1.20 mas .",
    "the @xcite value is 2.2-@xmath8 and 2.9-@xmath8 lower than the _ hipparcos _ and @xcite measures , respectively . to check for systematic offsets , we compared the parallaxes for all overlapping stars in these three sources . while the difference in parallax is most significant for @xmath0  crb",
    ", we found no systematic differences .",
    "moreover , @xcite performed statistical checks to verify the accuracy of their measure , so we adopt their parallax to derive the physical parameters of the component stars (  [ sec : phypar ] ) .",
    "the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array s unique capabilities , facilitated by the world s longest optical interferometric baselines , have enabled a variety of astrophysical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this work utilizes the array s longest baselines to resolve the 1.14-day spectroscopic binary , the shortest period system yet resolved .",
    "while this is the first visual orbit determined using interferometric visibilities measured with the chara array , the technique described here has regularly been employed for longer - period binaries using other long - baseline interferometers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0  crb binary has a projected angular separation of about 1.1 mas in the sky , making it easily resolvable for the chara array , which has angular resolution capabilities in the @xmath12 band down to about 0.4 mas for binaries .",
    "spectroscopic observations of @xmath0  crb were conducted at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) with an echelle spectrograph on the 1.5 m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory in the town of harvard , massachusetts .",
    "a total of 46 usable spectra were gathered from 1992 may to 1999 july , each of which covers a single echelle order ( 45   ) centered at 5188.5    and was recorded using an intensified photon - counting reticon detector ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the strongest lines in this window are those of the  b triplet .",
    "the resolving power of these observations is @xmath13 , and the nominal signal - to - noise ratios range from 21 to 94 per resolution element of 8.5  .",
    "radial velocities were obtained using the two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm todcor @xcite .",
    "templates for the cross correlations were selected from an extensive library of calculated spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.kurucz ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calculated spectra cover a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath14 ) , rotational velocities ( @xmath15 when seen in projection ) , surface gravities ( @xmath16 ) , and metallicities .",
    "experience has shown that radial velocities are largely insensitive to the surface gravity and metallicity adopted for the templates .",
    "consequently , the optimum template for each star was determined from extensive grids of cross - correlations varying the temperature and rotational velocity , seeking to maximize the average correlation weighted by the strength of each exposure . the results we obtain , adopting @xmath17 and solar metallicity  crb of [ fe / h ] @xmath18 with an uncertainty no smaller than 0.1 dex , and @xcite reported the value [ fe / h ] @xmath19 based on strmgren photometry .",
    "metallicity determinations for double - lined spectroscopic binaries are particularly difficult , and both of these estimates are likely to be affected at some level by the double - lined nature of the system . however , the visual companion ( @xmath6  crb ) is apparently a single star , and has an accurate spectroscopic abundance determination by @xcite giving [ fe / h ] @xmath20 , and another by @xcite giving [ fe / h ] @xmath21 .",
    "the near - solar metallicity from these determinations is considered here to be more reliable.[foot : metal ] ] for both stars , are @xmath22  k and @xmath23  for the primary , and @xmath24  k and @xmath23  for the secondary .",
    "estimated uncertainties are 150  k and 1  for the temperatures and projected rotational velocities , respectively .",
    "template parameters near these values were selected for deriving the radial velocities .",
    "typical uncertainties for the velocities are 1  for both stars .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of our velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "additional corrections for systematics were applied to the velocities as described by @xcite and @xcite to account for residual blending effects .",
    "these corrections are based on simulations with artificial composite spectra processed with todcor in the same way as the real spectra .",
    "the final heliocentric velocities and their 1-@xmath8 errors are listed in table  [ tab : cfarvs ] , along with the corresponding epochs of observation , @xmath25 residuals , and orbital phase .    the light ratio between the components was estimated directly from the spectra following @xcite .",
    "after corrections for systematics analogous to those described above , we obtain @xmath26 at the mean wavelength of our observations ( 5188.5   ) .",
    "given that the stars have slightly different temperatures , a small correction to the visual band was determined from synthetic spectra integrated over the @xmath3 passband and the spectral window of our observations .",
    "the corrected value is ( @xmath27 .",
    "the visual companion @xmath6  crb was also observed spectroscopically at the cfa with the same instrumental setup .",
    "we obtained 18 observations between 1996 june and 2004 august .",
    "the stellar parameters were determined with a procedure similar to that used for @xmath0  crb , and yielded @xmath28  k and @xmath29  , for an adopted @xmath17 and solar metallicity ( see footnote  [ foot : metal ] ) .",
    "radial velocities were obtained with standard cross - correlation techniques using a template selected according to the above parameters .",
    "these measurements give an average velocity of @xmath30  , with no significant variation within the observational errors .",
    "we use this radial velocity to unambiguously determine the longitude of the ascending node for the wider @xmath31  crb visual orbit (  [ sec : outervb ] ) .",
    "in addition to our own , four other radial - velocity data sets have been published in the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; sr03 ) . except for the more recent one ,",
    "the older data are generally of lower quality and contribute little to the mass determinations , but they do extend the time coverage considerably ( to nearly 86 years , or @xmath32 orbital cycles ) and can be used to improve the orbital period . because of our concerns over possible systematic differences among different data sets , particularly in the velocity semi - amplitudes but also in the velocity zero points , we did not simply merge all these observations together indiscriminately , but instead we proceeded as follows .",
    "we considered all observations simultaneously in a single least - squares orbital fit , imposing a common period and epoch of maximum primary velocity in a circular orbit , but we allowed each data set to have its own velocity semi - amplitudes ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) as well as its own systematic velocity zero - point offset relative to the reference frame defined by the cfa observations .",
    "additionally , we included one more adjustable parameter per set to account for possible systematic differences between the primary and secondary velocities in each group .",
    "these were statistically significant only in the observations by sr03 .",
    "relative weights for each data set were determined by iterations from the rms residual of the fit , separately for the primary and secondary velocities .",
    "the resulting orbital period is @xmath35 days , and the time of maximum primary velocity nearest to the average date of the cfa observations is @xmath36 ( hjd ) .",
    "we adopt this ephemeris for the remainder of the paper .",
    "interferometric visibilities for @xmath0  crb were measured during 2007 may@xmath37july at the chara array s six - element long - baseline interferometer located on mount wilson , california @xcite .",
    "the array uses the visible wavelengths 480800 nm for tracking and tip / tilt corrections , and the near - infrared @xmath12 ( 2.13 @xmath38 m ) and @xmath39 ( 1.67 @xmath38 m ) bands for fringe detection .",
    "the 26 visibility measurements used in the final orbit determination , listed in table  [ tab : visib ] , were obtained in the @xmath12 band on the s1-e1 and s1-e2 two - telescope baselines spanning projected baselines of 268331 meters .",
    "the interference fringes were obtained using the pupil - plane `` chara classic '' beam combiner .",
    "while some of the data were obtained via on - site observing at mount wilson , the bulk of the data were gathered at the arrington remote operations center ( aroc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) located at the georgia state university campus in atlanta , georgia . following the standard practice of time - bracketed observations , we interleaved each target visibility measurement with those of a calibrator star ( hd 152598 ) in order to remove instrumental and atmospheric effects .",
    "for further details on the observing practice and the data reduction process , refer to @xcite .",
    "we selected hr 6279 ( hd 152598 ) , an f0v star offset from @xmath0  crb by 83 , as the calibrator based on its small estimated angular diameter and its apparent lack of any close companions .",
    "we obtained photometric measurements for this star in the johnson @xmath40 bands from @xcite and @xcite , and @xmath41 bands from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) and transformed them to calibrated flux measurements using the methods described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then fitted these fluxes to spectral energy distribution models , yielding an angular diameter of 0.467 @xmath1 0.013 mas for hd 152598 , corresponding to @xmath42 k and @xmath43 .",
    "this diameter estimate results in a predicted calibrator visibility of @xmath44 at our longest baseline of 330 m , contributing roughly 1% error to the calibrated visibilities . this error is included in our roughly 10% total visibility errors listed in table  [ tab : visib ] , along with the epoch of observation ( at mid - exposure ) , the target star s calibrated visibility , the predicted visibility for the best - fit orbit , the @xmath25 visibility residual , the baseline projections along east - west ( @xmath45 ) and north - south ( @xmath46 ) directions , and the hour angle of the target .",
    "consistent with prior evidence of a synchronized orbit ( sr03 ) , we adopt a circular orbit ( @xmath47 @xmath48 0 , @xmath49 @xmath48 0 ) with the orbital period ( @xmath50 ) and epoch of nodal passage ( @xmath51 ) from  [ sec : historical ] for the spectroscopic and visual orbit solutions presented below .",
    "our measured radial velocities enable us to derive the three remaining spectroscopic orbital elements , namely , the center - of - mass velocity ( @xmath52 ) and the radial velocity semi - amplitudes of the primary and secondary ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ) . to check for consistency with prior efforts",
    ", we used the velocities published in sr03 to derive a second orbital solution .",
    "the calculated radial velocities for the derived orbits are shown in figures  [ fig : cfa_orb ] and  [ fig : str_orb ] ( solid and dashed curves for the primary and secondary , respectively ) along with the measured radial velocities and residuals for the primary ( filled circles ) and secondary ( open circles ) .",
    "the corresponding orbital solutions are presented in table  [ tab : sbele ] along with the related derived quantities . for comparison purposes",
    ", we have also included the values presented in sr03 , which are consistent with our orbit generated using their velocities .",
    "however , the orbit obtained using our velocities is statistically different from the one obtained using sr03 velocities . while the primary s velocity semi - amplitude matches within the errors between these two solutions , the secondary s differs by over 5-@xmath8 , resulting in a 4-@xmath8 difference in the mass ratios .",
    "one possible explanation of the difference in the orbital solutions could be the velocity residuals for the orbit using sr03 data ( figure  [ fig : str_orb ] ) , which show an obvious pattern for both components .",
    "those observations were obtained on four nights over a five - day period . to further examine these patterns , we display the residuals for each of the four nights in figure  [ fig : str_resid ] , as a function of time .",
    "clear trends are seen on each night , which are different for the primary and secondary components and have peak - to - peak excursions reaching 4  in some cases , significantly larger than the velocity errors of 0.11.2  ( sr03 ) . on some but",
    "not all nights , there appears to be a periodicity of roughly 0.200.25 days .",
    "the nature of these trends is unclear , particularly because this periodicity is much shorter than either the orbital or the rotational periods .",
    "instrumental effects seem unlikely , but an explanation in terms of the considerable spottedness of both stars is certainly a distinct possibility .",
    "the doppler imaging maps produced by sr03 show that both components display a very patchy distribution of surface features covering the polar regions .",
    "individual features coming in and out of view as the stars rotate could easily be the cause of the systematic effects observed in the radial velocities , and the effects would not necessarily have to be the same on both stars , just as observed .",
    "slight changes in the spots from one night to the next could account for the different patterns seen in figure  [ fig : str_resid ] .",
    "the relatively large amplitude of the residual variations raises the concern that they may be affecting the velocity semi - amplitudes of the orbit , depending on the phase at which they occur .",
    "we do not see such trends in the cfa data , perhaps because our observations span a much longer time ( more than 7 years , and @xmath72200 rotational cycles ) , allowing for spots to change and average out these effects .",
    "we therefore proceed on the assumption that possible systematic effects of this nature on @xmath33 and @xmath53 are lessened in the cfa data .",
    "the basic measured quantity from an interferometric observation is _ visibility _ , which evaluates the contrast in the fringe pattern obtained by combining starlight wave fronts from multiple apertures , filtered through a finite bandwidth . for a single star of angular diameter @xmath54 , the interferometric visibility @xmath3 for a uniform disk model",
    "is given by , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the first - order bessel function , @xmath57 is the projected baseline length as seen by the star , and @xmath58 is the observed bandpass central wavelength .",
    "the interferometric visibility for a binary , where the individual stars have visibilities @xmath59 ( primary ) and @xmath60 ( secondary ) per equation ( [ eq : vsgl ] ) above , is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the primary to secondary flux ratio , * b * is the projected baseline vector as seen by the binary , and * s * is the binary s angular separation vector in the plane of the sky .",
    "using our measured interferometric visibilities and the above equations , we are able to augment the spectroscopic orbital solutions to derive a visual orbit for @xmath0  crb . adopting the period and epoch of nodal passage from  [ sec : historical ] , we now derive the parameters that can only be determined astrometrically : angular semimajor axis ( @xmath63 ) ; inclination ( @xmath64 ) ; and , longitude of the ascending node ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we also treat the @xmath12-band magnitude difference as a free parameter in order to test evolutionary models .    for a circular orbit ,",
    "the epoch of periastron passage ( @xmath66 ) is replaced by the epoch of ascending nodal passage ( @xmath67 ) , defined as the epoch of fastest secondary recession , in the visual orbit equations @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we translate the @xmath51 value listed in  [ sec : historical ] by one - half of the orbital period to determine the epoch of the ascending nodal passage as @xmath68 ( hjd ) for use in our visual orbit solution .",
    "the 1-@xmath8 errors of this and other adopted parameters listed in table  [ tab : vbele ] have been propagated to our error estimates for the derived parameters .",
    "the angular diameters of the components are too small to be resolved by our @xmath12-band observations .",
    "we therefore estimate these based on the components absolute magnitudes and temperatures as described below .",
    "we first estimate the johnson @xmath3-band magnitude of @xmath0  crb using its tycho-2 magnitudes of @xmath69 and @xmath70 and the relation @xmath71 from the guide to the tycho-2 catalog .",
    "then , using the @xmath3-band flux ratio from  [ sec : spectroscopy ] and the @xcite parallax , we obtain absolute magnitudes of @xmath72 for the primary and @xmath73 for the secondary .",
    "these magnitudes lead to linear radius estimates of 1.2@xmath74  for the primary and 1.1@xmath74   for the secondary using the tabulation of stellar physical parameters in @xcite and @xcite . finally ,",
    "using the @xcite parallax , we adopt component angular diameters of @xmath75 mas and @xmath76 mas , propagating a 0.05 mas uncertainty in these values for deriving the uncertainty of our orbital elements .",
    "diameter estimates using the temperatures of the components from  [ sec : spectroscopy ] are consistent with these values .",
    "we conduct an exhaustive search of the parameter space for the unknown parameters mentioned , namely , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the orbital inclination is constrained by the @xmath78 from spectroscopy , the free - parameter @xmath63 , and the @xcite parallax .",
    "we impose this constraint during our exploration of the parameter space along with its associated 1-@xmath8 error .",
    "we explore the unknown parameters over many iterations , by randomly selecting them between broad limits and using equation ( [ eq : vbin ] ) to evaluate the predicted binary visibility for the baseline and binary positions at each observational epoch .",
    "the orbital solution presented here represents the parameter set with the minimum @xmath79 value when comparing the predicted and measured visibilities .",
    "figure  [ fig : vfit ] shows the measured visibilities ( plus signs ) with vertical error bars for each of the 26 observations , along with the computed model visibilities ( diamonds ) , and table  [ tab : visib ] lists the corresponding numerical values of the observed and model visibilities along with the residuals of the fit .",
    "table  [ tab : vbele ] summarizes the visual orbit parameters for @xmath0  crb from our solution and figure  [ fig : orbplot ] plots the visual orbit in the plane of the sky .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : orbplot ] , we have a reasonably good phase coverage from our observations .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : specorb ] , star spots can create systematic effects in the data obtained on this binary .",
    "these effects are especially significant for data obtained over a short time baseline , as seen for the sr03 spectroscopic solution .",
    "while our interferometric data span 73 days , allowing for some averaging of these effects , the bulk of the data used were obtained over 12 days , justifying an exploration of this effect .",
    "specifically , the separation between the stars derived from our visibility data would represent the separation of the centers of light rather than that of mass . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", heavily - spotted stars will incur a systematic shift in the center of light from rotational and orbital motions , perhaps inducing an additional uncertainty in the orbital elements derived .",
    "we assume a spot - induced change in the angular semimajor axis of 2% of the primary s diameter , or 0.01 mas .",
    "this is less that the uncertainty of our derived semimajor axis , and at our baselines of 270330 meters , translates to a 0.0050.011 change in the visibility . while the uncertainties of our measured visibilities are an order of magnitude larger than this , we ran a test orbital fit by adding a 0.010 uncertainty to the visibility errors as a root - sum - squared .",
    "while , as expected , the @xmath79 of the fit improved , the values and uncertainties of the derived parameters remained unchanged , leading us to conclude that this effect , while real , is too small to affect our results .",
    "we determine the 1 , 2 , and 3-@xmath8 uncertainties of each visual orbit parameter using a monte carlo simulation approach .",
    "we compute the orbital fit for @xmath80 iterations , where for each iteration , we randomly select the adopted parameters within their respective 1-@xmath8 intervals and the model parameters around their corresponding best - fit solution , generating a multi - dimensional @xmath79 `` surface '' . then , we project this surface along each parameter axis , resulting in the plots shown in figures  [ fig : aerr ] to  [ fig : dkerr ] .",
    "the figures show the @xmath79 distribution around the best - fit orbit and enable estimation of 1 , 2 , and 3-@xmath8 errors for each parameter based on a @xmath79 deviation of 1 , 4 , and 9 units , respectively , from its minimum value .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines in the figures from bottom to top mark the minimum @xmath79 value and those corresponding to 1 , 2 , and 3-@xmath8 errors , and table  [ tab : vbele ] lists the corresponding numerical 1-@xmath8 errors of the model parameters .",
    "our angular semimajor axis obtained from interferometry translates to 0.0279 @xmath1 0.0003 au or 5.99 @xmath1 0.07 @xmath74  using the @xcite parallax .",
    "newton s generalization of kepler s third law then yields a mass - sum of 2.227 @xmath1 0.073 @xmath2  for the pair , and using the mass ratio from our spectroscopic solution of 0.9586 @xmath1 0.0047 , we get individual component masses of 1.137 @xmath1 0.037 @xmath2  and 1.090 @xmath1 0.036 @xmath2  for the primary and secondary , respectively . as noted in  [ sec : specorb ] , the sr03 velocities yield a significantly different mass ratio of 0.9746 @xmath1 0.0016 , but this 4-@xmath8 difference is not enough to influence the mass estimates significantly . the uncertainty in our masses is dominated by the cubed semimajor axis factor in estimating the mass sum , resulting in about a 3% uncertainty in mass - sum corresponding to a 1% uncertainty in the semimajor axis .",
    "the high precision of the mass ratio from the spectroscopic solution results in final masses of 3% uncertainty as well .",
    "component mass estimates using the sr03 velocities are 1.128 @xmath1 0.037 and 1.099 @xmath1 0.036 , in excellent agreement with the masses using our velocities .",

    "assuming synchronous and co - aligned rotation of spherical components , reasonable given the short orbital period and evidence from sr03 of unevolved stars contained within their roche limits , we can estimate the component radii from the measured spectroscopic @xmath15 . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : spectroscopy ] , our spectra yield @xmath81  for both the primary and secondary .",
    "these values and uncertainties are identical to those in sr03 . using the inclination from our visual orbit , and adopting the orbital period from spectroscopy as the rotational period , we get identical component radii of 1.244 @xmath1 0.050 @xmath74  for the primary and secondary .",
    "this translates to an angular diameter of 0.509 @xmath1 0.020 mas for each component using the @xcite parallax , in excellent agreement with our adopted diameter for the primary and a 1-@xmath8 variance for the secondary , given our associated 0.05-mas errors for these values .",
    "these radii estimates , along with the effective temperatures from  [ sec : spectroscopy ] and the relation @xmath82 , lead to a luminosity ratio of 0.89 @xmath1 0.16 .",
    "alternatively , using bolometric corrections from @xcite of @xmath83 and @xmath84 corresponding to the components effective temperatures , the @xmath3-band flux ratio of 0.70 @xmath1 0.02 from spectroscopy translates to a total luminosity ratio of 0.68 @xmath1 0.20 , a 1-@xmath8 variance from the estimate above .",
    "conversely , our estimates of effective temperature and luminosity ratio require a radius ratio of 0.88 @xmath1 0.14 , again at a 1-@xmath8 variance from the 1.00 @xmath1 0.06 estimate from the identical @xmath15 values of the components .",
    "we allowed the @xmath12-band magnitude difference to be a free parameter for our visual orbit fit , obtaining @xmath85 , consistent with the 0.18 estimate from the mass - luminosity relations of @xcite  @xmath86 mass @xmath86 1.0  @xmath2 .",

    "each point along the isochrones plotted in figure  [ fig : hrplot ] corresponds to a particular mass , allowing us to use our mass estimates for the components of @xmath0  crb to further constrain the system s age .",

    "adopting the @xcite parallax of the a component , we estimate a mass - sum of 3.2 @xmath1 0.9 @xmath2 , resulting in a b - component mass estimate of 1.0 @xmath2 , consistent with its spectral type of g1 v @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate a mass of 0.77 @xmath1 0.21 @xmath2  based on high - resolution spectroscopy , but we believe that they systematically underestimate their uncertainty by overlooking the @xmath99 factor in converting from uncertainty in @xmath100 to uncertainty in @xmath92 . using the @xmath99 factor , we followed their methods to obtain a mass estimate of 0.77 @xmath1 0.44 @xmath2 .",

    ", we get @xmath103 or 603 , given the 180@xmath11  ambiguity in @xmath65 for the inner orbit , confirming coplanarity as a possibility .",
    "in addition to the three solar - type stars , the wds lists three additional components for @xmath8  crb .",
    "we present evidence to show that wds components c and d are optical alignments , while component e , itself a binary , is a physical association .",

    "our spectroscopy supports prior efforts in estimating the same @xmath15 values for both components , which assuming a synchronized , co - aligned rotation , results in equal radii of 1.244 @xmath1 0.050 @xmath74  for both components .",
    "the corresponding radius ratio is consistent within 1-@xmath8 with its estimate using the components temperatures and flux ratio from spectroscopy .",
    "we have also shown that this binary resides in a hierarchical quintuple system , composed of three close sun - like stars and a wide m - dwarf binary .",
    "the wider visual orbit companion , @xmath6  crb , is about 7@xmath10 away in a 726-year visual orbit with @xmath119 , which appears to be coplanar with the inner orbit .",
    "a comparison of the mass and absolute magnitude estimates of @xmath6  crb and @xmath0  crb with current stellar evolution models indicates a young age for the system of 13 gyr , consistent with the relatively high li abundance previously measured .",
