    "chimera state refers to the intriguing spatiotemporal pattern in which regions of coherence and incoherence coexist .",
    "this peculiar pattern was first observed and analyzed by kuramoto in simulating the complex ginzburg - landau equation with nonlocal couplings @xcite , and was later revisited and named chimera state by abrams and strogatz @xcite . for their implications to the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in dolphins and birds @xcite , chimera and chimera - like states have been extensively studied over the past decade @xcite . by a ring of phase oscillators coupled with the cosine kernel , the exact solution of chimera state was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . by a minimal model consisting of two interacting populations of oscillators ,",
    "the stability and bifurcations of chimera state were analyzed in ref .",
    "besides the original model of coupled phase oscillators , chimera states have also been reported in other types of systems , including different oscillating dynamics ( e.g. , the periodic and chaotic maps , the stuart - landau oscillator , and the hindmarsh - rose oscillator @xcite ) , different coupling functions ( e.g. , the time - delay and multi - channel couplings @xcite ) , and different network structures ( e.g. , the two - dimensional lattices and complex networks @xcite ) . moreover , as in - depth studies being conducted , many new properties of chimera state have been disclosed , e.g. , the brownian motion of the coherent region @xcite , the transient feature of the chimera pattern @xcite , and the existence of multiple coherent regions @xcite . in experimental studies , chimera states have been observed in chemical , electronic , and optical systems @xcite .",
    "recently , the control of chimera states has also been investigated @xcite .    in exploring the collective behaviors of coupled chaotic oscillators",
    ", an interesting phenomenon is that the oscillators can be self - organized into synchronous clusters , e.g. , the cluster ( group ) synchronization @xcite . in cluster synchronization ,",
    "the motions of the oscillators within the same cluster are highly correlated , and are weakly or not correlated if the oscillators belong to different clusters @xcite .",
    "recently , cluster synchronization in complex networks has also been studied @xcite .",
    "in particular , pecora @xmath0 has studied the generation of cluster synchronization in symmetric complex networks , and found the interesting phenomenon of isolated desynchronization .",

    "@xcite , the stability of the chimera - synchronization state depends on both the network symmetry and coupling strength , making it difficult to be observed in the general networks . considering the important implications of chimera - synchronization to the functioning and security of many realistic networks , e.g. , the power - grid network , it is desirable if stable chimera - synchronization can be generated by some control methods .    in the present work",
    ", we propose an effective control method for inducing chimera - synchronization in asynchronous complex networks .",

    "iii , we shall apply the proposed method to different network models , including a small - size artificial network , the nepal power - grid network , and a large - size complex network .",

    "our model of complex network of coupled chaotic oscillators is described by the differential equations @xmath1 with @xmath2 the oscillator ( node ) indices , @xmath3 the state vector associated with the @xmath4th oscillator , and @xmath5 the uniform coupling strength .",
    "@xmath6 describes the local dynamics of the oscillators , which is chaotic and , for the sake of simplicity , is set as identical over the network .",
    "@xmath7 represents the coupling function .",
    "the structural connectivity of the network is captured by the coupling matrix @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the coupling strength that node @xmath4 is received from node @xmath10 . if nodes @xmath4 and @xmath10 are not directly connected , we set @xmath11",
    ". the diagonal elements of @xmath12 are set as @xmath13 , so as to make @xmath12 a laplacian matrix .",
    "this model of linearly coupled nonlinear oscillators has been widely adopted in literature for investigating network synchronization . in particular , the stability of the global synchronization state can be analyzed by the method of master stability function ( msf ) @xcite , which shows that the synchronizability of a network is jointly determined by the network structure and nodal dynamics .",
    "we first describe how to identify the set of nodes supporting potentially a synchronous cluster , based on the the information of network symmetries @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath10 be a pair of nodes in the network whose permutation ( exchange ) does not change the system dynamical equations [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] , we call @xmath14 a symmetric pair and characterize it by the permutation symmetry @xmath15 . scanning over all the node - pairs in the network , we are able to identify the whole set of permutation symmetries \\{@xmath16 , which forms the symmetry group @xmath17 . each symmetry @xmath18 can be further characterized by a permutation matrix @xmath19 , with @xmath20 if @xmath14 is a symmetric pair , and @xmath21 otherwise .",
    "@xmath19 is commutative with the coupling matrix , @xmath22 , and , after operating on @xmath12 , it only exchanges the indices of nodes @xmath4 and @xmath10 .",
    "the set of permutation symmetries for a complex network in general is huge , but can be obtained from @xmath12 by the technique of computational group theory @xcite . having obtained the symmetry group @xmath17 , we then can partition the network nodes into clusters according to the permutation orbits , i.e. , the subset of nodes permuting among one another by the permutation operations are grouped into the same cluster .",
    "in such a way , the network nodes will be grouped into @xmath23 clusters .",
    "assuming that the network initially is staying on the fully desynchronized state ( i.e. , no synchronization is established between any pair of nodes ) , our main objective in the present work is to make one of the @xmath23 clusters synchronized , while , in the meantime , keeping the remaining nodes still desynchronized .",
    "our method of inducing chimera - synchronization is the following .",
    "firstly , we select from @xmath23 clusters the one we want to induce synchronization , e.g. , the @xmath24th cluster which contains @xmath25 nodes .",
    "we denote the set of nodes in cluster @xmath24 as @xmath26 , and , by reordering the network nodes , label them with the new indices @xmath27 $ ] . then , we pin all oscillators in cluster @xmath24 by an external controller .",
    "the controller has the same local dynamics and coupling function as the oscillators , but are coupled to the oscillators in the one - way fashion ( i.e. , the oscillators in cluster @xmath24 are affected by the controller , but not vice versa ) . finally , we increase the pinning strength until the desired chimera - synchronization state is generated . with the pinning control , the dynamics of the networked oscillators",
    "is governed by the equations @xmath28,\\ ] ] with @xmath29 the normalized pinning strength , @xmath30 the sate of the controller , and @xmath31 the delta function : @xmath32 if @xmath4 @xmath33 @xmath26 , and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "the controller has the same dynamics as the oscillators , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the specific questions we are interested and going to address are : can chimera - synchronization be induced by such a control method ? and , if yes , what is the necessary pinning strength ?    as",
    "nodes inside a cluster are commutative with each other , the chimera - synchronization state is naturally a solution of the system equations .",
    "that is , if we set the initial conditions of the oscillators in cluster @xmath24 to be identical , then during the process of system evolution , the states of these oscillators will be always the same .",
    "the chimera - synchronization state , however , might be unstable , due to either the weak coupling strength or the network topology @xcite . in the presence of pinning control",

    "the significance of the transformation lies in separating the eigenvalues into two different groups . )",
    "as the transverse modes are decoupled from the other modes , the synchronizability of the pinned cluster therefore can be analyzed separately .",

    "let @xmath77 be the largest lyapunov exponent calculated from eq .",

    ", the oscillators in the pinned cluster are still satisfying the permutation symmetry , but they are not exchangeable with the controller . as the pinned oscillators are perturbed by the desynchronized oscillators while the controller is not , it is therefore impossible to make the pinned oscillators synchronize with the controller .",
    "however , if the whole network is synchronized ( instead of chimera synchronization ) , it would be possible to control the synchronous manifold .",
    "in such a case , the enlarged network will reach the state of global synchronization instead of chimera synchronization @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", we have proposed a general pinning method for inducing chimera synchronization in symmetric complex networks of coupled chaotic oscillators , and found that , given the network contains a group of symmetric nodes , there always exits a critical pinning strength beyond which a stable synchronous cluster can be generated on the background of desynchronized nodes .",
    "we have conducted a detail analysis on the stability of the chimera - synchronization state , and obtained the formula of the critical pinning strength . the feasibility and efficiency of the control method",
    "have been verified by numerical simulations on various network models , with the numerical results in good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "our studies shed new lights on the collective dynamics of complex networks , and might potentially be used to the design of modern control techniques .",
