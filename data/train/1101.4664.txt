    "a scan of the cmssm parameter space was performed , requiring acceptable radiative electroweak breaking , non - tachyonic susy particle masses ( avoiding colour and charge breaking vacua ) , consistency with the experimental bounds on superpartner masses and with constraints from br@xmath11 , br@xmath12 and the muon @xmath13 as detailed in  @xcite .    in figure [ higgsp ]",

    "thus if one excludes the low - fine - tuned regions of the cmssm one can say that much larger ranges of the mssm parameter space are also disfavoured . to date the only class of non - cmssm models with mssm spectrum that have lower fine - tuning",
    "are those with non - universal gaugino masses with a ` natural ' relation between them that reduces the gluino mass relative to the cmssm case .",
    "in addition to ew fine - tuning , another important constraint is that the thermal relic abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which contributes to dark matter , should be consistent with cosmological observations , .",
    "here we use micromegas  @xcite as computational tool . imposing the constraints of @xcite limits the allowed region to be in the coloured regions of figure  [ higgsp ] . in regions  1 ( red ) and 5",

    "the dominant processes are stau and stop co - annihilation , respectively .",

    "the higgs boson plays a very important role because , _",

    "for this it is important to analyse the nature of the susy spectrum in the region of low fine - tuning ( @xmath24 ) in light of the higgs mass and dark matter constraints .",

    "furthermore , the sug3 signal distribution has a very distinct shape , what can help to distinguish it from the background .",
    "we therefore conclude that the sug3 point , which is representative for the @xmath61 co - annihilation region , should also be visible during the first lhc run .",
    "however , even after applying our optimization procedure , the signals of points sug2 and sug5 are not visible with 7  tev cm energy and 1  fb@xmath26 of data .",
    "we estimate that @xmath84 ( 20 )  fb@xmath26 would be necessary for a @xmath82 discovery of point sug2 ( sug5 ) at 7 tev .",
    "as shown in figures  [ dists0 ] and [ dsc7 ] , the first lhc run at 7 tev with 1 fb@xmath26 luminosity will clearly be able to find unambiguous evidence for non standard model physics scenarios with a light gluino or sub - tev squarks , in agreement with the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite",
    ". however , once a signal is seen , it will be important to distinguish between the different regions of susy parameter space and indeed to check whether it is a gluino and/or squarks that are initially produced .",
    "the accessible scenarios for the first lhc run , represented by the points sug0 , sug1 and sug3 , have distinct properties that can provide an indication of which class of events is realized . here",
    "we focus on three main distinguishing characteristics : the @xmath51 , @xmath53 and @xmath47 distributions .    from figure  [ dists0](a )",
    "we see that the amplitude of the signal of each point is directly related to its respective gluino mass .",
    "therefore the observed number of signal events could point to the gluino mass scale .",
    "region  1 ( red ) has a light lsp in the 5060  gev mass range , see fig .",
    "[ dmcdmsboundft100 ] , in order to have a @xmath85 resonant annihilation .",
    "consequently the gluino is also light , with a mass between 400 and 500  gev ( assuming @xmath86 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath61 co - annihilation region ( region 3 ) features heavier lsps of 120250  gev mass and a small @xmath87@xmath50 mass difference ; this results in @xmath88  gev , as seen in figure  [ higgsp1](b ) .",
    "therefore , these two scenarios , represented by points sug1 and sug3 , belong to disconnected regions in the cmssm parameter space .",
    "finally , the remaining low - fine - tuned region that does not satisfy the wmap bound , represented by the sug0 point , lies in the intermediate gluino mass range , with @xmath89  gev .",
    "if a signal is observed during the first lhc run , the number of observed events can indicate the gluino mass scale . unless @xmath90 lies in the overlap region , which is disfavoured by dark matter considerations , it could point to the relevant scenario .",
    "another important discriminant between the @xmath61 co - annihilation and @xmath85 resonant annihilation regions is the jet multiplicity .",
    "since the former has @xmath91 , in most cases the jets from gluino decays will be soft and escape detection .",
    "therefore the signal will mostly consist of 24 jet events coming from squark cascade decays . for the red points ( region 1 ) , on the other hand",
    ", the light gluinos will go through 3-body decays and generate events rich in jets . as a consequence , region 1",
    "will most likely be primarily observed in the multijet channel , while region 3 ( green points ) will be visible at lower jet multiplicities , as already indicated by the discovery channels discussed above .",
    "figure  [ dists0](c ) shows the jet multiplicities for @xmath92 gev and @xmath43 gev .",
    "although the sug3 point is not visible in this channel , it illustrates the behavior just described : the sug3 signal peaks at low jet multiplicities ( @xmath93 ) and points sug1 and sug0 show a peak at @xmath94 .",
    "so far the @xmath0 and @xmath53 distributions seem to provide useful tools to distinguish between regions 1 and 3 .",
    "however , both these distributions are similar for the sug0 and sug1 points and give little hope of distinction between these two scenarios . on the other hand , the dilepton invariant - mass distribution in figure  [ dists0](b ) shows an interesting distinction between points sug0 and sug1 .",
    "while both points display the @xmath95 mass edge , only the events from sug0 have a visible peak at the @xmath96 mass .",
    "such a peak is characteristic of the low - fine - tuned region in figure  [ higgsp ] that does not satisfy the wmap bound , in which there are significant gluino decays to the heavier neutralinos @xmath97 .",
    "this is not the case for region 2 ( red points ) , as here @xmath64 is systematically larger , the fraction of points where the channel is kinematically accessible is : @xmath98 for the low fine - tuned region that does not satisfy the wmap bound , @xmath99 for the light red points in figure  [ higgsp ] that sub - saturate the relic density and @xmath100 for the dark red points that saturate the relic density . ] , as seen in table  [ tab : bm ] .",
    "however , as the total number of z di - lepton events expected in the 7 tev run is only about 3 , one will have to wait for the second stage of lhc running to use this measure to distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "nevertheless the @xmath47 distribution can still provide another important information about the underlying model . as discussed above",
    ", the excess of dilepton events at low invariant mass is characteristic of @xmath101 decays with @xmath102 . for the @xmath85 resonance annihilation ( red region )",
    ", the mass difference of the two lightest neutralinos has a rough gaussian distribution of @xmath103 gev ( @xmath104 of all points are within the range 4961  gev ) .",
    "therefore , if the neutralino mass difference is greater than this , but the observed signal still is consistent with a light gluino ( @xmath105 gev ) , then cmssm neutralino dark matter is not likely .",
    "finally , the observation of a signal rich in dijets ( and taus ) plus @xmath51 but poor in @xmath106 dilepton events would point to the sug3 scenario .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the first lhc run will be able to test a considerable portion of the low fine - tuned cmssm , the exceptions being the @xmath52 resonant annihilation ( sug5 ) and the low @xmath64 , high @xmath107 ( sug2 ) regions . while the latter will be accessible to the next generation of dark matter direct detection experiments , it is still desirable to have a corroboratory signal at the lhc",

    ", there is a large @xmath111-jet multiplicity in the sug2 signal , as shown in figure  [ dists1](c ) .",
    "this point would hence be easily visible above bg in the @xmath117 channels .",
    "the sug5 point has a heavier gluino ( @xmath118 tev ) and lighter 1st/2nd generation squarks , so the signal after cuts is dominated by gluino - squark production and the @xmath109 distribution is softer than in the sug2 scenario .",
