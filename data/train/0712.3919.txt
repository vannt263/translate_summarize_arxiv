    "a quantitative description of the low - energy physics of nucleons and pions based on the underlying theory of the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is still lacking , and the millennium prize for a solution of this problem is still outstanding .",
    "lattice qcd holds a promise to solve the problem one day by a sheer brute force , through a monte - carlo simulation of qcd in discrete euclidean spacetime . in the absence of such a solution ,",
    "the most appropriate framework for the description of the low - energy strong interaction is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) , an effective field theory of qcd written directly in terms of the hadronic degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the main guiding principle in the construction of @xmath0pt is the chiral symmetry of massless qcd lagrangian and the pattern of its breaking , which allows to organize the effective lagrangian in powers of derivatives of the goldstone boson fields  the pions , schematically : ( , n ,  ) = _ n l^(n)= _",
    "n o_n(c_i ) where @xmath3 are some field operators which may contain pion fields but not their derivatives .",
    "the all - possible field operators , constrained by chiral and other symmetries , appear with the free parameters , @xmath4 , the so - called low energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "the mass scale @xmath5 is the heavy scale which sets the upper limit of applicability of @xmath0pt and is believed to be of order of @xmath6 gev , the scale of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking that leads to the appearance of the goldstone bosons .",
    "this expansion of the lagrangian translates into a low - energy expansion of the @xmath7-matrix : s = _",
    "n a_n ( c_i ) where @xmath8 s are amplitudes which depend on lecs , and @xmath9 denotes the typical momentum of the particles .",
    "if an analogous expansion could be obtained directly from qcd , it would be equivalent to the @xmath0pt one , provides the lecs are matched to the qcd coupling , i.e. , @xmath10 . at present however the best one can do is to match the lecs to experimental data , and hope they take reasonable ( natural ) values , such that this above expansion is convergent .",
    "one case where the convergence of the @xmath0pt expansion is immediately questioned is the case of hadronic bound states and resonances . in the presence of a bound state or a resonance the low - energy expansion of the @xmath7-matrix goes as :",
    "s ~_n a_n ( ) ^n , where @xmath11 is the excitation ( binding ) energy of the resonance ( bound state ) .",
    "thus , the limit of applicability of @xmath0pt is limited not by @xmath12 gev but by the characteristic energy scale @xmath13 of the closest bound or excited state .",
    "furthermore , in the vicinity of a bound state or a resonance the @xmath7-matrix has a pole , which can not be reproduced in a purely perturbative expansion in energy that is utilized in @xmath0pt .",
    "this problem arises in various contexts , ranging from pion - pion scattering@xcite to halo nuclei@xcite . here",
    "i shall consider the case of the @xmath14 , which is an ideal study case for the problem of resonances in @xmath0pt .",
    "it is relatively light , with the excitation energy of @xmath15 mev , elastic , and well separated from the other nucleon resonances .",
    "it is also a very prominent resonance and plays an important role in many processes , including astrophysical ones , e.g. , it is responsible for the the so - called gzk cutoff ( damping of the high - energy cosmic rays by the cosmic microwave background ) .",
    "let me start with a simple example : compton scattering on the nucleon .",
    "the total cross - section of this process , as the function of photon energy @xmath17 , is shown in . in this case",
    "we are able to examine the entire energy range , starting with the soft - photon limit @xmath18 , through the pion production threshold @xmath19 and into the resonance region @xmath20 .    at energies up to around the pion production threshold",
    "the cross section shows a smooth behavior which can reproduced by a low energy expansion .",
    "in this region the @xmath16-resonance can be `` integrated out '' , as its tail contribution can be mimicked by the terms already present in the @xmath0pt lagrangian with nucleons only@xcite .",
    "higher in energy , however , the rapid energy variation induced by the resonance pole is not reproducible by a naive low - energy expansion . obviously , to describe this behavior it is necessary to introduce the @xmath16 as an explicit degree of freedom , hence include a corresponding field in the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the details of how this is done have recently been reviewed in@xcite .",
    "once the @xmath16 appears in the lagrangian the question is how to power - count its contributions . in @xmath0eft with pions and nucleons alone",
    "the power - counting index of a graph with @xmath21 loops , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) internal pion ( nucleon ) lines , and @xmath24 vertices from @xmath25th - order lagrangian is found as n _",
    "= 4 l - 2 n_- n_n + _ k k v_k .",
    "what about the graphs with the @xmath16 , such as those depicted in ?",
    "their power counting turns out to be dependent on how one weighs the excitation energy @xmath26 in comparison with the other mass scales of the theory . in this case",
    "we have the soft momentum @xmath9 ( or , @xmath17 ) , the pion mass @xmath27 , and heavy scales which we collectively denote as @xmath5 .",
    "the small scale expansion@xcite ( sse ) counts all light scales equally : @xmath28 .",
    "the small parameter is then : @xmath29 an unsatisfactory feature of such a counting is that the @xmath16-resonance contributions are always estimated to be of the same size as the nucleon contributions .",
    "as we have seen from , in reality the resonance contributions are suppressed at low energies while being dominant in the resonance region .",
    "therefore , the power counting _ overestimates _ the @xmath16-contributions at lower energies and _ underestimates _ them at the resonance energies .",
    "a more adequate power counting is achieved by separating out the resonance energy , e.g. , maintaining the following scale hierarchy , @xmath30 , within the power - counting scheme . in the",
    "so - called _",
    "`` @xmath31 expansion''_@xcite this is done by introducing a small parameter @xmath32 , and then counting @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "the power 2 is chosen here because it is the closest integer representing the ratio of these scales in the real world .",
    "obviously , the power counting of the @xmath16 contributions then becomes dependent on the energy domain : in the _ low - energy region _ ( @xmath35 ) and the _ resonance region _ ( @xmath36 ) , the momentum counts differently .",
    "this dependence most significantly affects the counting of the one - delta - reducible ( odr ) graphs .",
    "the 1st row of graphs in illustrates examples of the odr graphs for the compton scattering case .",
    "these graphs are all characterized by having a number of odr propagators , each going as s_odr~ ~ , where @xmath37 is the mandelstam variable , and the soft momentum @xmath9 in this case given by the photon energy . in contrast , the nucleon propagator in analogous graphs would go simply as @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , in the low - energy region , the @xmath16 and nucleon propagators would count respectively as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the @xmath16 being suppressed by one power of the small parameter as compared to the nucleon . in the resonance region , the odr graphs obviously all become large .",
    "fortunately , they all can be subsumed , leading to `` dressed '' odr graphs with a definite power - counting index .",
    "namely , it is not difficult to see that the resummation of the classes of odr graphs results in odr graphs with only a single odr propagator of the form s_odr^= ~ , where @xmath41 is the @xmath16 self - energy .",
    "the expansion of the self - energy begins with @xmath42 , and hence in the low - energy region does not affect the counting of the @xmath16 contributions .",
    "however , in the resonance region the self - energy not only ameliorates the divergence of the odr propagator at @xmath43 but also determines power - counting index of the propagator . defining the @xmath16-resonance region formally as the region of @xmath9 where |p-|",
    "^3 , we deduce that an odr propagator , in this region , counts as @xmath44 .",
    "note that the nucleon propagator in this region counts as @xmath39 , hence is suppressed by two powers as compared to odr propagators .",
    "thus , within the power - counting scheme we have the mechanism for estimating correctly the relative size of the nucleon and @xmath16 contributions in the two energy domains . in we",
    "summarize the counting of the nucleon , odr , and one - delta - irreducible ( odi ) propagators in both the @xmath45- and @xmath31-expansion .",
    ".the counting for the nucleon , one - delta - reducible ( odr ) , and one - delta - irreducible ( odi ) propagators in the two different expansion schemes .",
    "the counting in the @xmath31-expansion depends on the energy domain . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the following i will show two applications of the @xmath31 expansion to the calculation of processes in the @xmath16-resonance region .",
    "the pion electroproduction on the proton in the @xmath16-resonance region has been under an intense study at many electron beam facilities , most notably at mit - bates , mami , and jefferson lab .",
    "the primary goal of these recent experiments is to measure electromagnetic @xmath46 transition , which comes in three different multipoles : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . on the theory side ,",
    "these form factors have been studied in both the sse@xcite and the @xmath31-expansion@xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 transition can be induced by a pion or a photon .",
    "the corresponding effective lagrangians are written as :    ^(1)_n & = & n t^a ^ ( _ _ ) _ ^a + , + ^(2)_n & = & n t^3 ( _ _ ) f^ + , + ^(3)_n & = & n t^3 _ 5 f^+ ,    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 stand respectively for the nucleon ( spinor , isodublet ) , @xmath2-isobar ( vector - spinor , isoquartet ) , pion ( pseudoscalar , isovector ) fields ; @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the electromagnetic field strength and its dual , @xmath56 are the isospin-1/2-to-3/2 transition @xmath57 ) matrices .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the lecs describing the @xmath62 transition at the tree level .",
    "we consider now the pion electroproduction on the nucleon to nlo in the @xmath31 expansion . since we are using the one - photon - exchange approximation , transition see refs .",
    "the pion photoproduction can be viewed as the particular case of electroproduction at @xmath63 .",
    "= 9.5 cm    the pion electroproduction amplitude to nlo in the @xmath31-expansion , in the resonance region , is given by the graphs in , where the shaded blob in the 3rd graph denotes the nlo @xmath64 vertex .",
    "the 1st graph in enters at the lo , which here is @xmath65 .",
    "all the other graphs in are of nlo@xmath66 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : epio_cross2 ] , the different virtual photon absorption cross sections around the resonance position are displayed at @xmath67  gev@xmath68 , where recent precision data are available .",
    "we compare these data with the present  calculations as well as with the results of sl , dmt , and duo models  @xcite . in the  calculations ,",
    "the low - energy constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 , were fixed from the resonant pion photoproduction multipoles . therefore , the only other low - energy constant from the chiral lagrangian entering the nlo calculation is @xmath61 .",
    "the main sensitivity on @xmath61 enters in @xmath69 .",
    "a best description of the @xmath70 data at low @xmath71 is obtained by choosing @xmath72 .",
    "one sees that the nlo  calculation , within its accuracy , is consistent with the experimental data for these observables at low @xmath71 .",
    "since the low - energy constants @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are fixed to experiment , one can provide a prediction for the @xmath27 dependence of the @xmath73 transition .",
    "the study of the @xmath27-dependence is crucial to connect to lattice qcd results , which at present can only be obtained for larger pion masses .    in",
    ", one sees the @xmath27-dependence of the ratios @xmath74 and @xmath75 and compare them to lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the recent state - of - the - art lattice calculations of @xmath76 and @xmath77  @xcite use a _ linear _ , in the quark mass ( @xmath78 ) , extrapolation to the physical point , thus assuming that the non - analytic @xmath79-dependencies are negligible . the thus obtained value for @xmath77 at the physical @xmath27 value displays a large discrepancy with the experimental result , as seen in .",
    "this  calculation , on the other hand , shows that the non - analytic dependencies are _ not _ negligible .",
    "while at larger values of @xmath27 , where the @xmath2 is stable , the ratios display a smooth @xmath27 dependence , at @xmath80 there is an inflection point , and for @xmath81 the non - analytic effects are crucial .",
    "the @xmath27 dependence obtained here from   clearly shows that the lattice results for @xmath77 may in fact be consistent with experiment .",
    "the radiative pion photoproduction ( @xmath82 ) in the @xmath16-resonance region is used to access the @xmath83 magnetic dipole moment ( mdm )  @xcite .",
    "the pioneering experiment@xcite was carried out at mami in 2002 and a series of dedicated experiments were run in 2005 by the crystal ball collaboration with first results announced at this school  @xcite . in this process",
    ", the energy flow can be defined by the energies of incoming and outgoing photon . to access the mdm of the @xmath16",
    "the energy of the incoming photon must be sufficient to excite the resonance , while the emitted photon must be soft .",
    "therefore , in computing this process , one uses a chiral expansion with @xmath16-isobar degrees of freedom , the @xmath31-expansion , and simultaneously the soft - photon expansion with respect to the energy of the emitted photon . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the soft - photon expansion is performed to the next - next - to - leading order , since this is the order at which the mdm first appears , while the chiral expansion is performed to next - to - leading order .",
    "an interesting effect which can be studied here is the absorptive ( or , imaginary ) part of the mdm  @xcite .",
    "it arises due to the unstable nature of the @xmath2-isobar . in our calculation , for instance , we find the following result for the @xmath83 mdm ( in the heavy - baryon limit ) : _ ^+ = ( e/2 m _ ) . the absorptive mdms quantify the change in the width of the resonance that occurs in an external magnetic field @xmath84 : = 2 _ bn_s , where @xmath85 is the direction of the resonance s spin .",
    "equivalently , one may look for a change in the lifetime of the resonance : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the lifetime .",
    "such a change in the lifetime appears to be extremely small in moderate magnetic fields and is difficult to be observed directly  @xcite .",
    "there is perhaps a possibility to compute the absorptive mdms of hadron resonances in lattice qcd where the effect of arbitrarily large magnetic fields on the width can be studied .",
    "the  description of the @xmath88 unpolarized cross section was found to be consistent with first experimental data for this process@xcite .",
    "it appears that , at low energies of the outgoing photon , the dependence of the cross - section and linear - photon asymmetries on the mdm is quadratic , i.e. , depends on @xmath89 .",
    "the asymmetry for a circularly polarized photon beam , however , displays a linear dependence on the @xmath90 mdm .",
    "the helicity difference for a circularly polarized photon beam vanishes when approaching the soft - photon limit , with a rate that is proportional to the mdm .",
    "therefore , a dedicated measurement with a circularly polarized photon beam could provides a model - independent extraction of the @xmath2 mdm .",
    "i refer to the recent paper  @xcite for further details .",
    "in the single - nucleon sector the limit of applicability of chiral perturbation theory is set by the excitation energy of the first nucleon resonance  the @xmath16(1232 ) .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath16 in the chiral lagrangian extends the limit of applicability into the resonance energy region .",
    "the power counting of the @xmath16 contribution depends crucially on how the @xmath91 , weighted in comparison to the other mass scales in the problem , in this case the pion mass @xmath27 and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath5 .",
    "two different schemes exist in the literature . in the small scale expansion , @xmath92 , while in the `` @xmath31-expansion '' , @xmath93 .",
    "the hierarchy of scales used in the @xmath31 expansion provides a more adequate power - counting of the @xmath16-resonance contributions .",
    "it provides a justification for `` integrating out '' the resonance contribution at very low energies and for a resummation and dominance of resonant contributions in the resonance region .",
    "the @xmath31 expansion has already been successfully applied to the calculation of observables for processes such as compton scattering , pion electroproduction and radiative pion photoproduction in the @xmath16-resonance region .",
