    "these models usually consider a set of fundamental processes ( diffusion , aggregation , etc ) in order to find activation energies and related quantities for a particular deposition process or with the aim of investigating universal features valid for several materials and techniques .",
    "the simplest models consider irreversible aggregation ( ia ) of atoms to islands of size larger than a critical value @xmath7 .",
    "rate - equation ( re ) approaches predict the scaling of island and monomer densities ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) @xcite for any @xmath7 and show good agreement with simulation data , usually performed for @xmath7 ranging between @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the island size distributions ( isds ) were proposed by different approximation schemes @xcite and are still subject of debate . a recent advance by pimpinelli and einstein ( pe ) @xcite proposed that the capture zone distributions ( czds ) are described by the wigner surmise ( ws ) from random matrix theory @xcite [ the capture zone ( cz ) of an island is defined as the area in which a diffusing adatom is more likely to attach to that island than to any other one ] . after an initial controversy @xcite , that proposal was supported by simulation results for various island shapes after suitable rescaling @xcite , under conditions of high temperatures and low coverages .",
    "ia models are expected to model real systems in temperatures sufficiently low to neglect atom detachment from islands , but this condition is not obeyed in many real systems , even at room temperature . for this reason , suitable choices of the size @xmath7 are frequently combined with internal restructuring mechanisms to reconcile experimental data and ia predictions @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "a smaller number of works have addressed scaling properties of models with reversible aggregation ( ra ) @xcite .",
    "works on square lattices , which simulate metal @xmath12 homoepitaxy , have shown a crossover between ia scaling regimes with @xmath0 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "partially reversible models allowing only single - bond detachment were studied using simulations and improved re approaches and confirmed the crossover scaling between those regimes @xcite .",
    "the work on triangular lattices , which is related to @xmath13 epitaxy , shows a crossover between regimes with @xmath0 and @xmath5 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the scaling properties of island density , czds , and isds in a model of fully reversible island growth , using numerical simulations in square and triangular lattices and a scaling approach based on re results for ia models .",
    "we consider a canonical bond - counting model of clarke - vvedensky @xcite type , in which the activation energy for an adatom hop to a neighboring site depends only on the number of nearest neighbors at its initial position , with the temperature @xmath14 kept fixed during the growth .",
    "it respects detailed balance conditions , in contrast to ia . for a fixed coverage @xmath15 and increasing deposition temperature",
    ", the islands evolve from a fractal shape ( typical of ia with no island restructuring ) to a compact shape dominated by processes of adatom detachment and reattachment , and the island density continuously decrease .",
    "the previously studied crossovers of ia regimes are reproduced , but an additional crossover from @xmath5 to @xmath4 in triangular lattices is found . at high temperatures , a nontrivial regime where the island density increases with temperature is observed , with a large density of small clusters coexisting with large compact islands .",
    "the gaussian right tail of czds predicted by the pe approach is observed in all regimes for small coverages and sufficiently high temperatures , even when the czds are bimodal .",

    "[ triangular ] , that discussion is extended to triangular lattices .",
    "[ conclusion ] summarizes our results and presents our conclusions .",
    "in the ra model , the adsorbed atoms can occupy sites of a square or triangular lattice , with the maximum of one adatom per site .",
    "there is a random flux of @xmath16 atoms per site per unit time .",
    "adsorption is allowed only if the site of incidence is empty , so that a single layer is formed on the substrate lattice .",
    "this condition is reasonable for small coverages .",
    "the hopping rate of an adatom at a given site @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 ( proportional to its surface diffusion coefficient ) , with the activation energy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of adatoms in nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites of @xmath17 , @xmath21 is an energy barrier for surface diffusion of free adatoms , and @xmath22 is the bond energy for each nn .    the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 were kept fixed in most simulations .",
    "the last value is characteristic of @xmath26 epitaxy @xcite .",
    "some data were obtained with @xmath27 and @xmath28 in order to confirm general scaling predictions .",
    "broad ranges of temperature were studied , thus the conclusions can be extended to other systems by considering the diffusion - to - deposition ratio of free adatoms @xmath29 as the main model parameter . due to the large frequency @xmath30 ,",
    "one typically has @xmath31 , even at low temperatures .",
    "several values of the bond energy @xmath22 are analyzed , and scaling approaches are facilitated by using the detachment probability ( binding factor ) @xmath32 . since @xmath33 is considered throughout this work and the largest experimentally relevant temperatures do not exceed @xmath34 , the condition @xmath35 always applies .",
    "it is also important to observe that both @xmath3 and @xmath2 increase with temperature .",
    "simulations were performed in very large lattices , typically of lateral size @xmath36 , with at least @xmath37 realizations up to coverage @xmath38 for each parameter set .",
    "comparison with results in @xmath39 for the largest coverages and temperatures shows no significant finite - size effect .",
    "standard algorithms were able to provide accurate estimates of densities and distributions up to large values of @xmath3 ( however , extensions to the multilayer regime or to models with a larger number of atomistic processes would benefit from special algorithms developed for this class of model @xcite ) .    in the ia models , islands with a number of atoms larger than the critical size @xmath7 are stable",
    "moreover , islands of size @xmath7 are assumed to have a binding energy @xmath40 . during the deposition process , after a transient regime , islands grow by capture of diffusing adatoms , with negligible formation of new islands . in this steady state , rate - equation theory @xcite predicts that the stable island density scales as @xmath41 } r^{-\\chi } \\label{nisl}\\ ] ] and the monomer ( free adatom ) density scales as @xmath42 } r^{\\chi -1 } , \\label{n1}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 these results assume that the mean capture number of stable islands is independent of the coverage .",
    "information on the growth dynamics can also be extracted from the probability densities of island size @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and of cz area @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( isd and czd , respectively ) .",
    "the isd follows the scaling form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a scaling function , and an equivalent scaling form applies to @xmath47 .",
    "alternatively , scaling with the variance @xmath50 may be used as @xmath51 this procedure was previously used with ia models @xcite and is helpful in other problems , such as scaling of roughness distributions of thin film growth models @xcite .    the best know approach to predict the shape of czd in ia is that of pe , which proposes the czd to be described by the ws @xmath52        where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the substrate dimension ( @xmath56 in the present work ) and the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 are determined by normalization conditions .",
    "this proposal follows from the phenomenological argument that the czd can be extracted from a langevin equation representing the competition of neighboring islands for adatom aggregation .",
    "several experimental works have already shown agreement of czds with the ws , such as growth of para - sexiphenyl islands @xcite , @xmath59 deposition with impurities @xcite , pentacene island growth with impurities @xcite , @xmath60 quantum dot growth on @xmath61 @xcite , and @xmath62 deposition on @xmath63 films @xcite .    in ref .",

    "1a - c illustrate the island evolution for @xmath64 and temperatures representative of different scaling regimes .",
    "2a shows the temperature evolution ( parametrized by @xmath3 ) of the island density and monomer density for coverage @xmath65 and several values of @xmath22 .    for very low temperatures ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "both densities are nearly temperature - independent , and the system behaves as in random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) without diffusion @xcite , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the subsequent low temperature regime , hereafter called regime _ i _ , is characterized by the decrease of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "2a . in this regime ,",

    "again , the longest regime with @xmath4 scaling is observed for @xmath68 ; fits of the data for @xmath87 ( nearly two decades in @xmath3 ) give @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are consistent with eqs .",
    "( [ nisli ] ) and ( [ nisliiinitial ] ) ( see the predicted slopes in fig .",
    "2b ) .    for @xmath90 , fig .",
    "2a shows that the slope of the @xmath91 plot slowly increases in regime _ ii_.",
    "this occurs because the binding energy @xmath92 becomes negligible at the end of this regime , so that @xmath8 and @xmath9 scale tend to scale only with @xmath3 , as @xmath93 [ the same power laws of eq .",
    "( [ nisliiinitial ] ) excluding the @xmath2-dependence ] . the same evolution of slopes is observed in all effective ia regimes observed in the ra model ( see sec .",
    "[ triangular ] ) .    as the temperature increases , a crossover to a new scaling regime",
    "is expected by two reasons : rapid detachment of doubly bonded atoms from islands with @xmath94 , which occurs in a characteristic time @xmath95 or slow atom deposition in the cz , which occurs in a characteristic time @xmath96     and different deposition rates and binding energies in the square lattice .",
    "the insets show scaled monomer densities.,width=302 ]    in the steady state of ia , @xmath97 [ eq . ( [ taudep ] ) ] is of the same order of @xmath76 [ eq . ( [ tauag ] ) ] .",
    "thus , regime _ ii _ is expected to end as @xmath98 [ eq . ( [ tau2 ] ) ] matches @xmath76 , i. e. , when @xmath99 .",
    "this defines a second crossover variable as @xmath100 crossover scaling follows from eq .",

    "2c illustrates the crossover scaling for various @xmath22 , with an excellent collapse of @xmath8 data .",
    "some deviations appear for @xmath9 , probably due to scaling corrections . the expected slope @xmath102 before the crossover , predicted by eq . ( [ nisliifinal ] ) , is also shown in fig .",
    "the fits of the data for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , in the range @xmath105 ( nearly one decade in @xmath3 ) , give slopes @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , both close to the theoretical value .",
    "this gives additional support to the proposed evolution in regime _",
    ", to an @xmath2-dependent to an @xmath2-independent scaling .    after the crossover , a fully reversible regime _",
    "iii _ is attained , completely different from ia .",
    "2a shows that the island density and the monomer density increase with temperature in this regime , in striking contrast with regimes _ i _ and _ ii _ and all ia models . fig .",
    "1c shows that it is characterized by a very large density of small islands , mainly isolated adatoms , and a small density of very large islands .",
    "as time evolves , these large islands grow at the expense of the small ones , i. e. , there is island ripening @xcite .    in regime _ iii _ , the density of small islands is much larger than the density of large islands .",
    "this is an expected evolution from regime _ ii _ because @xmath9 decreases with temperature slower than @xmath8 [ eq .",
    "( [ nisliiinitial ] ) ] .",
    "this trend is expected for any regime with @xmath108 , which gives @xmath109 , and will also be shown in the triangular lattice .",
    "the high - temperature scaling in regime _",
    "iii _ is only @xmath2-dependent , with @xmath110 indeed , since movement of free adatoms is very fast , only the attachment - detachment dynamics is important to determine the densities .",
    "this steady state regime can be predicted by noting that double bonding is the minimal possible bonding for an island in the square lattice , i. e. at least four atoms of a large island have two bonds . equating aggregation and detachment rates obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ tauag ] ) and ( [ tau2 ] ) , we get the above relation for @xmath9 . since regime _",
    "iii _ takes place as the evolution of an effective @xmath4 ia regime ( also related to lattice structure ) , where @xmath111 , we obtain the above relation for @xmath8 .    in order to search for possible effects of deposition rate ( @xmath16 ) or amplitude of hopping rates ( @xmath30 ) , fig . 3",
    "compares the crossover scaling ( a ) from regimes _ i _ to _ ii _ and ( b ) from _ ii _ to _ iii _ , obtained for @xmath112 and different binding energies @xmath22 .",
    "the good data collapses in fig . 3 show the general validity of the above scaling relations .",
    "despite the effective ia scaling of regime _",
    "i _ , the czds usually do not match the ws with @xmath0 ( @xmath113 ) for the values of @xmath22 and temperatures considered here .",
    "2a shows that regime _",
    "i _ typically occurs with @xmath114 .",
    "this range is intermediate between low adatom mobility ( rsa behavior ) and high adatom mobility ( pe behavior ) , thus czds show a crossover scaling , as shown in ref .",
    "similar crossover is observed in the isds .",
    "for instance , considering @xmath90 , for @xmath115 we observe simple exponential tails of czds ( rsa ) and for @xmath6 they become gaussian ( pe ) , but still not collapsing with the ws .     and temperatures @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) . the insets show the same scaled distributions with squared abscissas .",

    "the inset shows the same distributions with squared abscissas .",
    "the dashed lines highlight the gaussian decays of the right tails.,width=264 ]    the czds in regime _",
    "ii _ are not well fitted by the ws with @xmath4 ( @xmath122 in eq . [ ws ] ) , probably because this is not a true ia process , as shown in fig .",
    "4a . however , as the temperature increases , the czd gets closer to that ws .",
    "this occurs considering scaling with the average [ eq . ( [ scalingtrad ] ) ] or with the variance [ eq . ( [ scalingvariance ] ) ] .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "4a shows that the tails of the czds are gaussian , similarly to ia models @xcite .",
    "this trend fails only for very small @xmath22 because regime _",
    "ii _ is attained with small @xmath3 and crossover from rsa is present .",
    "the isd has features similar to those of ia models of compact islands ( e. g. square islands ) , as shown in fig .",
    "4b : the left tail is high , indicating the presence of a large number of small islands , and the right tail shows a gaussian decay . as the coverage increases , a crossover to simple exponential decay is observed in the czds and isds , similarly to the ia models @xcite .",
    "5a shows isds in regime _",
    "iii _ , with left tails",
    "much higher than the peaks , confirming the presence of a large density of free adatoms and small islands .",
    "the left tail shows even - odd oscillations characteristic of loose - packed lattices ( inset of fig .",
    "5a ) . if the small islands were in near - equilibrium conditions , the walton relation @xcite @xmath123 would apply and an exponential decay of the left tail would be observed . however , this is not the case : the inset of fig .",
    "5a shows an approximately power - law decay , with large exponents that depend on the coverage , which suggests that more complex mechanisms govern the small island dynamics .    in regime _",
    "iii _ , @xmath124 ,",
    "thus a small island will probably disappear before a new atom is deposited in its cz .",
    "the concept of cz as the probable region for deposition of a new atom to be captured by that island becomes irrelevant .",
    "anyway , we also measured the czds in that regime and observed that they are bimodal , as shown in fig .",
    "the first peak corresponds to small islands and the second peak corresponds to the large islands .",
    "the bimodal czds are completely different from those of ia models , where distortions of the monomodal shapes of isds and czds appear only for large coverages @xcite . as @xmath15 increases , the first peak of the czd moves to the left ( smaller czs for small islands ) and the second one moves to the right ( larger czs for large islands ) .    a surprising result in the inset of fig .",
    "5b is that the gaussian right tail of the czds is preserved for low coverages in regime _",
    "iii_. thus , the competition of large islands for the capture of diffusing adatoms is still that predicted by the pe approach in the fully reversible regime .",
    "the small islands , which rapidly dissociate into isolated monomers , contribute to maintain the competitive dynamics of the neighboring large islands .",
    "the right tails of the corresponding isds are also gaussian , following the trend of compact islands already explained in ref . @xcite .    in experiments , very small islands ( @xmath125 ) may not be detected in microscopy images , except if high resolution techniques are used .",
    "if that is the case , the first peak of the bimodal czds may be lost , but the gaussian right tail will be preserved .",
    "this may suggest ia behavior in a system with fully reversible dynamics .",
    "6a shows the @xmath3-dependence of the island density for various values of @xmath22 .",
    "it has the main features of the ra model in the square lattice , including the high temperature crossover to the fully reversible regime , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 increase with @xmath3 . however , some important features of ra are particular of the triangular lattice , as discussed below .    the crossover from a fractal island regime",
    "( @xmath0 ) to the first regime of compact islands is equivalent to that in the square lattice , occurring when @xmath75 matches @xmath76 and leading to the crossover relations in eq .",
    "( [ nislcrossi ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "the subsequent regime is hereafter called _ iia _ and corresponds to ia with @xmath5 , i. e. with the smaller stable island being a triangle with @xmath126 adatoms , shown in fig .",
    "7a . from eq .",
    "( [ nislcrossi ] ) and the re equations ( [ nisl ] ) and ( [ n1 ] ) for @xmath5 , regime _ iia _ has initial scaling as @xmath127 this trend is confirmed by the slope of the curves in fig .",

    "this is explained by the recurrence properties of random walks in two dimensions , since the detachment times of doubly bonded atoms in islands with @xmath11 and @xmath151 atoms are the same and that feature could not be predicted solely with a mean - field approach .",
    "although the czds shows some deviations from the ws in these regimes with @xmath152 , their right tails are typically gaussian , indicating that the pe theory is reasonable to represent the competition of large islands for free adatom capture .",
    "exceptions appear for small values of @xmath22 , where those regimes may appear for small @xmath3 .    a final crossover to a fully reversible regime _",
    "iii _ is observed as @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) in the square ( triangular ) lattice .",
    "in contrast to ia scaling , this regime is characterized by an increase of the island density and of the monomer density with temperature , for fixed coverage .",
    "a large density of small islands coexists with a small density of very large islands .",
    "the corresponding isds show a high left tail and the czds are bimodal .",
    "the gaussian right tails of czds and isds are also observed , despite the reversible nature of the aggregation , and are explained because the small islands do not change the main mechanisms for the large islands to compete for free adatom aggregation .",
    "these results show that the gaussian right tails of czds are kept in reversible aggregation , as predicted by the pe approach for ia .",
    "the same occurs with isds . in experiments where the resolution of imaging techniques is not high",
    ", detection of small islands may be difficult and even the high temperature regimes may have isds and czds similar to those of ia .",
    "this may explain the success of pe predictions to describe a variety of experimental results , for various materials and growth conditions @xcite ."
