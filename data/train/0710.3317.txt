    "it is known that in some compounds the superconducting order can coexist with a magnetic order of the ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic type .",
    "for example , in ternary rare - earth compounds such as ( re)rh@xmath3b@xmath3 and ( re)mo@xmath4x@xmath5 ( x = s , se ) the superconducting and magnetic ordering coexists in a narrow temperature range ( see the review @xcite and a more recent paper @xcite and references therein ) . in errh@xmath3b@xmath3 superconductivity takes place in the interval 0.7 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 0.8 k , and the magnetic ordering arises below @xmath8=0.8 k. in homo@xmath4s@xmath5 the magntic ordering occurs below @xmath8= 0.74 k , whereas superconductivty exists in the temperature range 0.7 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath6 1.8 k. besides , the superconducting and magnetic order is realized in the layered perovskite ruthenocuprate compound rusr@xmath9gdcu@xmath9o@xmath5 rut1,rut2,rut3,rut4,buzdin01 . in this compound",
    "an antiferromagnetic order and , perhaps , a weak ferromagnetism take place .",
    "a uniform magnetization is impossible in a bulk superconductor as the magnetic field destroys superconductivity . in order to explain the coexistance of ferromagnetism and superconductivity , ginsburg and later anderson and suhl supposed that this coexistance is possible in case of a domain or spiral magnetic structure @xcite .",
    "the period of the magnetic structure has been calculated in ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) , and on the order of magnitude it is equal to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fermi momentum and @xmath12 is the correlation length in a clean superconductor .",
    "for example , in homo@xmath4s@xmath5 the wave vector of the periodic magnetic structure @xmath13 @xmath14@xcite .    as is well known , many characteristics of a superconductor ( the critical temperature , the density - of - states etc ) can be calculated if the green s functions of the system , including the anomalous ones ( or gorkov s functions ) , @xmath15 , are found @xcite .",
    "these functions for a magnetic superconductor ( _ ms _ ) with a spiral structure have been obtained in ref.@xcite . in this case",
    "the functions @xmath15 depend on the center - of - mass coordinate and momentum direction so that the system is anisotropic .",
    "long ago , it was established that surface effects are essential for finite anisotropic samples such as anisotropic superconductors and high t@xmath16 superconductors with @xmath17 wave pairing ( see , for example , ref.buchholtz and also the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the order parameter may be suppressed near the superconductor / vacuum or superconductor / insulator ( _ s / v _ or _ s / i ) _ interface .",
    "a high impurity concentration leads to averaging the green s functions in the momentum space so that in the diffusive limit , characteristics of the system do not depend on the sample size .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the surface effects are important in _ _ ms__s with a spiral magnetic structure .",
    "in particular , the green s functions of the system are disturbed by boundary conditions at the @xmath18 or @xmath19 interface in samples with any impurity concentration .",
    "corrections to the bulk greens functions due to boundary conditions oscillate in space with the period @xmath20 and decay from the interface over a length of the order @xmath21 in the ballistic limit and of the order @xmath22 in the diffusive limit .",
    "the surface effects become very important in the cases when one needs to know the green s functions near the interfaces . for instance , the josephson current @xmath23 in an _",
    "ms / i / ms _ tunnel junction is determined by the values of the green s functions near the _ ms / i _ interface ( _ i _ stands for an insulating layer ) .",
    "the josephson current @xmath23 in the _ ms / i / ms _ junction with a spiral magnetic structure was calculated in ref.@xcite on the basis of the tunnel hamiltonian method .",
    "the authors used the gorkov s functions calculated in ref.rusinov for an infinite _ ms _ with a spiral magnetic structure in the ballistic limit .",
    "they have obtained that the josephson critical current @xmath24 depends on the angle @xmath25 between the magnetization directions in both _ _ ms__s near the interface and calculated the dependence of @xmath24 on different parameters of the junction ( the exchange field , the wave vector of the spiral , @xmath26 , etc ) .",
    "it has been established that at some values of parameters the critical current becomes negative ( @xmath27 - state ) .",
    "we will show here that , although the current @xmath24 indeed depends on @xmath25 in a way similar to that in ref.kulic , the dependence of @xmath28 on various parameters is completely different .",
    "the point is that the tunnel hamiltonian method is not applicable to inhomogeneous superconductors and , in particular , to _ _ ms__s with a spiral magnetization . in order to calculate @xmath24 ,",
    "one has to solve the eilenberger or usadel equation with boundary conditions at the _ ms / i _ interface .",
    "it turns out that the green s functions at the _ ms / i _ interface differ essentially from their values in the bulk , and correspondingly the josephson current also differs substantially from its value obtained on the basis of the bulk green s functions .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze the ballistic case . using the eilenberger equation generalized for the case of the _ ms _ with a magnetic spiral , we find the spatial dependence of corrections to the bulk green s functions . in sec .",
    "iii , the diffusive case will be considered . using a generalized usadel equation complemented by boundary conditions at the _ ms / i _ interface",
    ", we calculate the josephson current in _",
    "ms / i / ms _ tunnel junction and compare the obtained critical josephson current @xmath28 with that obtained on the basis of the tunnel hamiltonian method . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the obtained results .",
    "we consider a _ ms _ with a spiral magnetic structure . the exchange field acting on free electrons is assumed to lay in the @xmath29 plane and to rotate in space with the wave vector @xmath26 ; that is , the vector of the exchange field is : @xmath30 with @xmath31 , ( @xmath25 is the angle between the magnetization and @xmath32-axis at @xmath33 ) .",
    "the superconducting order parameter @xmath34 is taken into account in the mean field approximation : @xmath35 , i.e. the singlet pairing is assumed .",
    "the eilenberger equation is derived in a standard way ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference between the cases of an ordinary , nonmagnetic superconductor and _ ms _ with a spiral structure is that the quasiclassical green s function @xmath36 in the latter case is a @xmath37 matrix in the gorkov - nambu and spin space .",
    "this equation has the form    @xmath38+i[\\mathbf{h(}x\\mathbf{)s},\\check{g}]+\\left [ \\hat{\\delta}\\otimes \\hat{\\sigma}_{3},\\check{g}\\right ] + ( i/2\\tau ) \\left [ \\langle \\check{g}\\rangle , \\check{g}\\right ] = 0\\;.   \\label{eilen}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is the fermi velocity , @xmath40 @xmath41 are the pauli matrices in the spin and gorkov - nambu space , and @xmath42 are the unit matrices .",
    "the square and angle brackets mean the commutator and averaging over angles , respectively , and @xmath43 is an elastic scattering time . in order to exclude the coordinate dependence of the third term in eq.([eilen ] ) , we perform a transformation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is an operator corresponding to a rotation in the spin and particle - hole space , and @xmath46 is a new matrix",

    "the subindex ",
    "@xmath49  is omitted .  from the physical point of view",
    ", the transformation given by eq.([rotation ] ) means the transition to a rotating coordinate system , in which the magnetization vector is directed along the @xmath32-axis .",
    "that is why the exchange field @xmath50 in eq.([eilenmodif ] ) contains only the @xmath32-component .    for simplicity",
    ", we restrict the consideration with the case of temperatures close to the critical one of the superconducting transition , @xmath51 . in this case",
    "the matrix green s function @xmath36 may be represented in the form    @xmath52    where the anomalous ( gorkov s ) matrix function , @xmath53 , is assumed to be small , that is , all elements of this matrix are small .",
    "the first term is the normal , matrix green s function in the matsubara representation .    in this section ,",
    "we consider the ballistic case , i.e. we suppose that @xmath54 .",
    "substituting the matrix @xmath36 from eq.([eq2 ] ) into eq.([eilen ] ) , we come to the equation for the anomalous function @xmath55    @xmath56_{+}+2\\omega \\check{f}\\;+ih[\\hat{\\sigma}_{3},% \\check{f}]_{+}=\\hat{\\tau}_{2}\\otimes \\hat{\\sigma}_{3}\\delta sign\\omega . \\label{eilen3}\\ ] ]    we represent the matrix @xmath57 in the form    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath15 are matrices in the spin space that can be represented as a sum of pauli matrices    @xmath60    where @xmath61    eq.([eilen3 ] ) is a system of linear equations with respect to coefficients @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the solution of these equations consists of a part , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , constant in space and a nonhomogeneous part , @xmath66 and @xmath67 the latter part arises if there are nontrivial boundary conditions in the problem .",
    "the homogeneous part is a solution for an infinite sample when boundary conditions can be ignored .",
    "the homogeneous solution can be easily found .",
    "it has the form    @xmath68    where @xmath69 .",
    "all other coefficients ( i.e. @xmath70 ) equal to zero .",
    "the coefficient @xmath71 is the amplitude of the singlet component , and the coefficient @xmath72 is the amplitude of the triplet component with zero projection of the total spin of a cooper pair on the @xmath32-axis ( in the rotating coordinate system ) , @xmath73 .",
    "the singlet component is an even function of @xmath74 while the triplet component , @xmath72 , is an odd function of @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "one can see that the exchange field , @xmath50 , suppresses the amplitude @xmath71 , whereas at a sufficiently large wave vector of the spiral @xmath26 , the amplitude @xmath71 is restored to the value @xmath76 which is the amplitude of the condensate function in a nonmagnetic superconductor .",
    "note that the authors of ref.@xcite used only bulk solutions in the laboratory coordinate frame .",
    "these functions may be reduced to the quasiclassical green s functions in eq.([homsolution ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath71 determines a change of the critical temperature of the superconducting transition , @xmath51 , due to the exchange field @xmath50 and wave vector of the magnetic spiral @xmath26 ( see , for example , the review articles @xcite )    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the critical temperature in the absence of the exchange field @xmath50 .",
    "it is seen that with decreasing the spiral period , @xmath79 the suppression of the critical temperature is reduced and at @xmath80 the critical temperature is the same as in a nonmagnetic superconductor , i.e. @xmath81    now we turn to the calculation of corrections @xmath82 and @xmath83 that arise due to boundary conditions and depend on @xmath84 .",
    "note that if the correction @xmath85 is not small compared to @xmath71 , a correction to the order parameter @xmath86 will not be small as well .",
    "this circumstance makes the problem rather complicated because eq.(eilen3 ) becomes a system of six equations with the right - hand side which depends on @xmath84 . in order to simplify the problem",
    ", we assume that the correction @xmath85 is small and we can neglect a variation of @xmath34 in space .",
    "we will see below that in a general case @xmath85 may be comparable with @xmath71 . in this case",
    "our results are correct up to a numerical factor of the order unity . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the validity of the obtained results in more detail .",
    "thus , in order to find the corrections @xmath82 and @xmath87  we have to solve a system of homogeneous linear equations ( [ eilen3 ] ) without  the right - hand side . substituting the expansions ( [ ffpauli ] ) with @xmath82 and @xmath88 as the coefficients of these expansions into eq.([eilen3 ] )  with @xmath89 and  representing the coordinate dependence of these coefficients in the form @xmath90,@xmath91 , we obtain a system of six linear equations .",
    "one can see from these equations that the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath93 are antisymmetric functions of @xmath94 , whereas the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath96 are symmetric functions of @xmath94 .",
    "we do not write down these equations as they are rather cumbersome . instead of this , we write the determinant of the system which determines the eigenvalues @xmath97 it is reduced to a cubic algebraic equation    @xmath98+(1-\\lambda _ { \\omega } ) ( 1+z)^{2}(\\lambda _ { \\omega } -z)=0 \\label{det}\\ ] ]    where @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103and @xmath104 .    in order to find the eigenvalues",
    ", one has to solve this equation .",
    "we consider the most interesting case of large energy @xmath105 @xmath106 . in this case",
    "the critical temperature @xmath51 is close to @xmath78 .",
    "the solutions of eq.([det ] ) are    @xmath107    and    @xmath108    therefore , the eigenfunctions corresponding to @xmath109 oscillate in space with the period of the spiral and decay over the distance of the order @xmath110 the eigenfunction , which corresponds to @xmath111 , decreases monotonously from the interface over the correlation length @xmath112    the amplitudes @xmath62 and @xmath63 may be found from boundary conditions at the _ ms / v _ or _ ms / i _ interfaces @xcite    @xmath113    which read that the antisymmetric part of the green s function should turn to zero at the _ ms / i _ interface .",
    "one can solve the corresponding equations and find the amplitudes @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "however we will not do that for two reasons .",
    "first , the corresponding expressions are cumbersome .",
    "the second and more important reason is that the surface effects are displayed near the interface at which a random ( diffusive ) scattering takes place .",
    "therefore , the ballistic case considered in this section is not relevant to this situation . in the next section",
    "we consider a more realistic case of a sample with a high impurity concentration ( dirty case ) .",
    "we will find the eigenvalues @xmath114 and the amplitudes of eigenfunctions .",
    "one can show that the structure and form of the dependencies of the functions @xmath62 and @xmath63 on @xmath94 and @xmath75 are qualitatively the same in both cases , ballistic and diffusive .",
    "the only difference is that , whereas in the diffusive case only the zero and first terms in the expansion in spherical harmonics are important , in the ballistic case the dependence on @xmath94 is more complicated .",
    "in this section , we consider the influence of the boundary on the condensate functions assuming that the impurity concentration is high and the condition @xmath115 is satisfied , where @xmath116 is the mean free path . in this case",
    "the part of the condensate function @xmath117 antisymmetric in the momentum space is expressed through the symmetric part via the well known expression @xcite    @xmath118_{+ } )   \\label{asym}\\ ] ]    where @xmath119 is the ordinary quasiclassical green s function in the normal state ( see eq.([eq2 ] ) ) .",
    "the second term arises as a result of the transformation ( [ rotation ] ) , the term @xmath120_{+}$ ] means anti - commutator .",
    "one can see that the asymmetric part has the opposite parity in @xmath75 compared to the symmetric part @xmath57 ; if @xmath57  is an odd function of @xmath121 , then @xmath117 is an even function of @xmath75 and vice versa @xcite . in the simplest case of ordinary bcs superconductors",
    "the symmetric function near @xmath51 is equal to @xmath122 , i.e. is an even function of @xmath123 .",
    "obviously the antisymmetric part @xmath117 is an odd function of @xmath123 .",
    "this issue is discussed in detail in refs.@xcite .",
    "we assume again that the temperature is close to @xmath124 . the symmetric part of the condensate function @xmath57  after the transformation eq.([rotation ] ) obeys the equation @xcite    @xmath125_{+}\\}+2|\\omega |\\check{f}% \\;+ih_{\\omega } [ \\hat{\\sigma}_{3},\\check{f}]_{+}=2\\hat{\\tau}_{2}\\otimes \\hat{% \\sigma}_{3}\\delta .",

    "one can see that a coordinate - independent solution for eq.([usadel ] ) satisfies the boundary condition only if @xmath128 . if @xmath26 is not zero , the anti - commutator @xmath129_{+}\\neq 0 $ ] , and therefore @xmath130 also differs from zero at the boundary .",
    "we have to solve eq.([usadel ] ) with the boundary condition ( [ bcdif ] ) .",

    "in fact , this coefficient is equal to @xmath230 ( see eq.([joscurrent ] ) ) , where @xmath173 is the amplitude of the triplet component with zero projection of the spin on the local @xmath32-axis and @xmath177 is the amplitude of the @xmath175 triplet component at the interface .",

    "our consideration is restricted with temperatures @xmath7 near @xmath51 , where the dos is close to that in the normal state and the variation of the dos due to the surface effects is small .",
    "the calculation of the green s functions in a finite system at low @xmath7 is a more complicated task because the corresponding equations , strictly speaking , can not be linearized .",
