    "understanding the varied correspondence between quantum entanglement and quantum computation is one of the leading goals of quantum information science .",

    "the entanglement found in universal resource states , researchers have developed a long list of examples , from the 2d cluster state @xcite and certain tensor network states @xcite , to condensed matter models such as 2d affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) states @xcite and renormalization fixed - point states of interacting bosonic quantum matter @xcite .",
    "an emergent insight from these examples has been the utility of symmetry - protected topological order ( spto ) , a form of quantum order arising from nontrivial many - body entanglement protected by a symmetry @xcite . this insight has led researchers to investigate the possibility of a general correspondence between spto and mqc , with the ultimate aim of discovering a  universal computational phase \" of quantum matter . in such a phase ,",
    "the constituent states spto and symmetry alone are sufficient to organize them as universal resource states .",
    "while this approach has uncovered increasingly general examples of single - qubit computational phases in 1d spin chains @xcite , much less is known in the computationally important setting of 2d spin systems outside of variously perturbed phases containing the cluster state @xcite .",
    "this disparity comes not only from the increased complexity present in 2d many - body systems , but also from the existence of physically distinct forms of 2d spto with different operational capabilities @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we have yet to develop even a base model for realizing the idea of a universal computational phase within the framework of spto .    here",
    ", we demonstrate the existence of a universal computational phase within the simplified setting of  3-cocycle states \"  2d model states describing renormalization fixed - point spto @xcite  with global symmetry group @xmath1 .",
    "we first characterize those states which satisfy an additional fractional symmetry condition , where symmetry operators are applied to only a certain fraction of spins on a 3-colorable lattice .",
    "we show that 3-cocycle states with fractional symmetry admit an elementary description in terms of an algebraic component tensor , which constitutes a powerful tool for analyzing such states . using this description , we classify the families of fractionally - symmetric states under local unitary equivalence , and",
    "show that every such state is equal to a collection of multiple irreducible states .",
    "the union jack state of @xcite is seen to be the simplest nontrivial irreducible state , and its known universality for mqc lets us prove that every nontrivial @xmath1 3-cocycle state with fractional symmetry on a union jack lattice is a universal resource state .",
    "our findings , which include similar results in the setting of fractionally symmetric 1d spin chains , constitute compelling evidence for the existence of a universal computational phase among general fractionally symmetric spto states .",
    "measurement - based quantum computation ( mqc ) is a means of using an entangled many - body resource state to perform quantum computation via measurements which are local to single lattice sites .",
    "an mqc protocol is adaptive if the choice of measurement basis depends on previous measurement outcomes .",
    "a universal resource state is one which allows any unitary quantum circuit to be efficiently implemented using single - site measurements .    while mqc has historically focused on the 2d cluster state @xcite , which has a peculiar nature regarding spto ( c.f .",

    "an spto phase is the collection of all many - body states connected to some fiducial short - range entangled state by the action of a constant depth quantum circuit built from constant range , symmetry - respecting gates .",
    "the trivial spto phase is the unique phase containing unentangled product states . in this sense ,",

    "this extends to states in any @xmath26 spatial dimensions , where spto phases can be classified using @xmath27 . a more extensive introduction to group cohomology",

    "appendix  b of @xcite ) .",
    "however , the 1d cluster and union jack states each possess additional `` @xmath53 '' fractional symmetry , leaving them invariant under the application of @xmath35 to all spins on a fixed vertex color of a @xmath17-colorable lattice . as we show in section  [ sec : main_results ] , this symmetry arises from each cocycle being a @xmath17-linear function , which we define explicitly for @xmath32 .",
    "a function @xmath54 is 3-linear ( trilinear ) when it satisfies @xmath55 , and similar conditions for its second and third arguments .",
    "every trilinear function is a 3-cocycle , but one which possesses additional algebraic structure .",

    "considering the presence of fractional symmetry in the 1d cluster state and union jack state , it is natural to ask how this symmetry orders the entanglement of general many - body states .",
    "our main results constitute a largely exhaustive answer to this question for 1d 2-cocycle states and 2d 3-cocycle states .",
    "we first show that any @xmath53-symmetric cocycle state with @xmath70 or @xmath32 and @xmath1 is either a trivial product state , or is reducible by local operations to one or more disjoint copies of the 1d cluster state or the union jack state , respectively . for @xmath70 ,",
    "this characterization is complete , in the sense that every nontrivial @xmath71-symmetric cocycle state @xmath72 is isomorphic to @xmath73 copies of @xmath9 , for some @xmath74-dependent @xmath75 . when @xmath32 however , we show that general @xmath76-symmetric cocycle states with @xmath1 are isomorphic to @xmath73 disjoint  irreducible \" 3-cocycle states , of which the union jack state is the simplest .",

    "lemma  [ lem : one ] admits a natural generalization to arbitrary @xmath17 , but due to our focus on low - dimensional mqc resource states , we leave this general version as a conjecture . proving that @xmath17-linear cocycle states possess @xmath53-symmetry is trivial , so we focus on the reverse implication .",
    "our proof involves studying the action of fractional symmetry operators on local regions of a @xmath17-cocycle state @xmath30 , and iteratively building up necessary conditions for @xmath30 to possess @xmath53-symmetry .",

    "this decomposition of @xmath81 into @xmath5 or @xmath7 gates relies on a choice of generating set for each vertex color in our @xmath17-colorable lattice , on which color - dependent changes of generating set will act as gauge freedoms in our description of @xmath82 .",
    "we can fix these spurious degrees of freedom by determining the local unitary orbits of @xmath82 under color - dependent changes of basis , which in practice is equivalent to finding a normal form for our component tensor @xmath80 .    for 1d and 2d states ,",

    "this completes our proof of theorem  [ thm : one ] for @xmath70 , and in the process shows also that @xmath94 for all @xmath38 . in other words , the unique 1d irreducible cocycle state is the 1d cluster state .",
    "when @xmath32 , our formation unitaries @xmath95 correspond to 3-index component tensors @xmath66 , which are more difficult to characterize . in analogy to our proof for @xmath70 , we use color - dependent changes of basis to rewrite @xmath66 as a collection of @xmath73 irreducible tensors , which form the @xmath73 irreducible @xmath76-symmetric cocycle states in theorem  [ thm : one ] .",
    "more precisely , we say that a tensor @xmath66 is irreducible when it can not be written as the sum of two nonzero tensors with disjoint supports at every index .",
    "unlike the @xmath70 case , in @xmath32 there is no known analog of gaussian elimination for efficiently converting @xmath66 into this normal form . despite this difficulty",
    ", we show in appendix  [ sec : thmthree ] that we still arrive at a normal form which allows us to prove theorem  [ thm : one ] for @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , the behavior of general @xmath76-symmetric cocycle states can be determined entirely through a classification of the irreducible cocycle states .    in the simplest case of @xmath96 ,",

    "a numerical search shows that @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and we expect there to be an infinite number of irreducible states for general @xmath0 . despite this difficulty , it is nonetheless clear that every irreducible @xmath76-symmetric cocycle state should contain at least as much usable entanglement as the simple union jack state",
    "this intuition allows us to prove a useful operational corollary to theorem  [ thm : one ] for @xmath32 .    [ cor : one ] let @xmath101 be a nontrivial @xmath76-symmetric 3-cocycle state with global symmetry group @xmath0 defined on a union jack lattice . by appropriate color - dependent changes of basis and non - adaptive single - qubit @xmath15 measurements , @xmath101 can be reduced to @xmath73 disjoint copies of the union jack state , for the same state - dependent @xmath102 as in theorem  [ thm : one ] .",
    "consequently , @xmath101 is a pauli universal resource state for mqc .",

    "vertex entangled \" with other virtual qubits .",
    "this guarantees that measuring @xmath15 on all other virtual qubits will leave behind only the union jack state , up to unimportant pauli byproduct operators . applying this protocol to each irreducible @xmath83 in theorem",
    "[ thm : one ] suffices to prove corollary  [ cor : one ] .",

    "having discussed the general classification and computational power of low - dimensional @xmath76-symmetric cocycle states @xmath101 , we now move on to study their spto phases relative to the fractional symmetry group @xmath103 .",
    "this classification relative to @xmath103 is sufficient to determine the spto phase of @xmath101 relative to any subgroup of @xmath103 , including the usual global symmetry @xmath18 . while @xmath104 as groups , they differ operationally in the former arranging each copy of @xmath18 on a distinct vertex color (  horizontally \" ) , and the latter arranging each copy on a distinct layer of a single vertex (  vertically \" ) .",
    "this leads to a simple characterization of the spto present in these states , as given in theorem  [ thm : two ] .

    "we prove theorem  [ thm : two ] by embedding each 3-cocycle state @xmath101 into a larger hilbert space associated with @xmath109 , where the original @xmath103 fractional symmetry of @xmath101 is simulated using an operationally equivalent @xmath109 global symmetry .",
    "this lets us use a known classification of 2d spto phases relative to global @xmath109 symmetry to show that each component of @xmath66 is actually a unique label of the spto phase of @xmath101 , relative to @xmath103 . as a result , two states @xmath105 are in the same spto phase only when their associated tensors @xmath110 are identical , which proves theorem  [ thm : two ] .",
    "further details of our proof can be found in appendix  [ sec : thmthree ] .",
    "we have shown that computationally universal entanglement is a ubiquitous property of fixed - point states of spto with fractional symmetry . while we were able to obtain ",
    "exact \" universal resource states in our simplified setting of fixed - point model states , more general states in each spto phase may require renormalization - style techniques like those of @xcite to extract their usefulness for mqc .",

    "when a fixed generating set is used , each tensor @xmath66 uniquely describes the many - body state @xmath101 ; however , the lack of a canonical choice of generating set means that two states with non - identical tensors @xmath66 and @xmath331 might nonetheless be related by a local change of basis . to remedy this issue",
    ", we can analyze the  local unitary orbits \" of @xmath66 under index - dependent changes of basis , which act on each of @xmath66 s indices as invertible matrices over @xmath332 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath333 . using a decomposition of @xmath334 into elementary matrices ( those which implement elementary row and column operations )",
    ", it is easy to show that these changes of basis manifest physically as a product of clifford @xmath335 gates on the @xmath38 virtual qubits at each site , and consequently have no influence on the pauli universality of our @xmath101 .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ thm : one ] for @xmath32 involves a basic use of the normal form we have chosen for our 3-index tensor @xmath66 .",
    "we first define the support of @xmath66 at a specific index , say c , which is a certain subgroup @xmath336 associated to @xmath56 .",
    "our definition of the support is slightly unusual , as the collection of c - site unitary characters @xmath337 obtained by fixing arbitrary a- and b - site arguments .",
    "mathematically , @xmath338 . an obvious generalization of this definition is used for the a- and b - site supports @xmath339 and @xmath340 of @xmath66 .",

    "we give a proof of corollary  [ cor : one ] , which says that any nontrivial @xmath76-symmetric 3-cocycle state with @xmath1 can be reduced to @xmath73 disjoint copies of the union jack state via single - site measurements , showing that every such state is a pauli universal resource state for mqc .",
    "we note that these single - site measurements are single - qudit , but not generally single - qubit relative to the @xmath38 virtual qubits at each site .",

    "we ensure that the measurement of all other virtual qubits in the @xmath15 basis will leave a single copy of the union jack state on ( color - specific ) sites @xmath354 , @xmath355 , and @xmath356 , up to @xmath15 byproduct operators at the intersecting vertices .",
    "these byproduct operators can be accounted for with purely classical postprocessing , whereas edge - incident terms would have led to @xmath5 byproduct operators , which are nontrivial to correct for .",

    "we determine our change of basis iteratively , by examining each nonzero component which is edge incident with our fiducial component @xmath357 .",
    "if such a component , say @xmath358 ( with @xmath359 ) , is incident along the @xmath360 edge , we can eliminate this component by applying a shear operation @xmath333 to the c index of @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath333 has nonzero matrix elements of @xmath361 for all @xmath362 with @xmath363 , and @xmath364 .",

    "it is clear that this c - site change of basis will eliminate the offending component @xmath370 , while also avoiding the introduction of any new edge incident terms .",
    "we can utilize a similar technique to eliminate all components which are edge incident along @xmath371 or @xmath372 edges , showing that a series of such changes of basis will leave @xmath66 in our desired form , with @xmath349 at most vertex incident with all other components .",

    "the reverse implication may fail in a sufficiently general setting , owing to the lack of any obvious method for taking constant - depth quantum circuits defined on the embedded system and  unembedding \" them into circuits acting in the original setting of @xmath34-dimensional qudits.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    here we give a proof of theorem  [ thm : two ] , which states that every pair of non - identical @xmath76-symmetric 3-cocycle states with @xmath1 belong to different spto phases relative to @xmath103 .",
    "this in turn implies that every nontrivial @xmath76-symmetric cocycle state has nontrivial spto relative to @xmath103 .",

    "consequently , the only way for two @xmath76-symmetric states to have the same @xmath103 spto phase is to have the same component tensors , and consequently to be identical states .",
