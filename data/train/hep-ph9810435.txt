    "recently , a simple ansatz for neutrino masses was proposed @xcite : @xmath1 @xmath2 are the neutrinos of a given flavour ( bispinorial fields ) , @xmath3 is a small parameter discussed below .",
    "the neutrino mass scale @xmath4 can be expressed as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a heavy mass scale , suggestive of a seesaw explanation of the smallness of the neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "the elements of the mass matrix are specified up to ( generally complex ) coefficients of order of unity ; whenever these coefficients affect a relation , we will use the symbols @xmath7 @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the ansatz is characterized by a `` dominant block '' in the @xmath10 subspace , in the sense that the elements of this block are much larger than the others , as accounted by the parameter @xmath3 , and are comparable among them .    the underlying idea of this structure for the mass matrix is to identify @xmath11 and @xmath12 but to distinguish them from @xmath13 in a model where known characteristics of the charged fermions are also reproduced .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that in su(5 ) context , two matter fields @xmath14 may have the same flavour properties ( nonparallel family structure , in the following `` nfs model '' ) .",
    "a single parameter @xmath3 describes the flavour structure of charged fermions : @xmath15 the same goal was achieved by an anomalous u(1 ) family symmetry under which @xmath11 and @xmath16 have the same charge @xcite ( `` abe model '' ) , which suggested instead the identification with a power of the cabibbo angle : @xmath17 the identification of the flavour properties of the muon and tau neutrinos should not be taken naively .",
    "in fact , the ansatz is expected to be valid in a basis @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the su(2 ) partners have comparable couplings for @xmath20 and for @xmath21 hence , a large angle rotation on the `` left '' charged leptons is necessary to reach the flavour basis .",
    "only a theory of the coefficients of order unity can dissipate all the suspects that this rotation could spoil ( or seriously affect ) the ansatz ; we are assuming that this does not happen , or , more precisely , that the ansatz is valid in the flavour basis ( cfr .  with @xcite . ) .",
    "the simplicity of the neutrino mass matrix ( [ 1 ] ) is remarkable and perhaps of profound meaning .",
    "we will discuss this ansatz and its implications in the two models defined above , and in more generic cases ( that is , treating @xmath3 and @xmath4 as parameters ) .",
    "our aim in particular is : ( a ) to disentangle the generic and specific features of the ansatz ( [ 1 ] ) , and ( b ) to identify its predictions .    the mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) has only one massive eigenstate , mostly a combination of the muon and tau neutrino flavour eigenstates , whereas the other two states are massless . in general , this is modified when the factors of order unity are taken into account .",
    "there are three typical features :    * there are two massive neutrinos , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with masses of order @xmath24 and with a comparable mass splitting ; one lighter state has of mass order @xmath25 the natural assumptions for the eigenvalues of the `` dominant block '' are therefore the _ no - singularity _ hypothesis and the _ no - degeneracy _ hypothesis , the reference scale for `` small '' mass being @xmath26 * the muon and tau neutrinos are mostly combinations of the two heavy states , with a large mixing angle @xmath27 * the electron neutrino is almost coincident with the lightest state @xmath28 , and has mixing angles of order @xmath29 with the heavier states ( in another notation , @xmath30 ) : @xmath31    feature @xmath32 suggests that the splitting between the two heavier neutrinos is @xmath33 unless the _ no - degeneracy _ hypothesis is not fulfilled .",
    "therefore , assuming that @xmath34 gev , it is possible to incorporate the mass splitting necessary for the explanation of atmospheric neutrinos @xmath35 ev@xmath36 unfortunately , it is not possible to be more specific and _ predict _ whether @xmath37 ev@xmath38 or the contrary is true ( which is of crucial importance for the success of the k2k experiment @xcite ) .",
    "the large mixing angle instead comes automatically due to @xmath39 and this is the most attractive feature of the ansatz .",
    "in fact , this permits to explain the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite in terms of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the mixing ( [ 2 ] ) is quite close to the small mixing angle necessary for the adiabatic mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution @xcite of the solar neutrino problem , or to the angle required to explain the lsnd anomaly @xcite ( with nfs value ) .",
    "but , generically , also the mass splittings with the lighter neutrino are also @xmath40 for the _ no - singularity _ hypothesis : therefore , accounting for oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos , the solar or lsnd neutrino anomalies remain unexplained",
    ". we will discuss in the following sections the specific cases in which this conclusion does not hold .",
    "however , one could take a radically theoretical point of view , and suggest ( based on the ansatz , and on the mass scale chosen ) that only the atmospheric neutrinos _ should _ be explained by neutrino oscillations .",
    "this option would probably become more attractive if the results of the chlorine experiments could not be reproduced , the sno experiment @xcite failed to detect an excess of neutral current induced events , the theoretical extimations for solar neutrinos were much more uncertain than expected , and the lsnd anomaly was not confirmed by other experiments .",
    "the appealing feature of having two large mass splittings is the possibility to search for cp - violation in the leptonic sector in terrestrial experiments @xcite , for instance by comparing the probabilities of conversion : @xmath41 the phases of oscillations in vacuum @xmath42 are comparable among them , and of interest for terrestrial experiments since : @xmath43 the leptonic analogue of the jarlskog invariant : @xmath44 is suppressed due to the presence of two small mixings ( eq .  ( [ 2 ] ) ) : @xmath45 ( or smaller , depending on the phases ) .",
    "observable effects in forthcoming experiments would imply : @xmath46 that is not far from the value in the nfs model ( [ nfs ] ) , but much larger than the value ( [ abe ] ) .",
    "another feature of the models ( [ nfs ] ) and ( [ abe ] ) , is that the electron neutrinos are not expected to undergo any significant oscillation in the atmosphere .",
    "hence , the search for a subdominant mixing by using the lowest energy neutrino - induced events @xcite will also test the mass matrix ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the present bound @xmath47 at 90 % cl , obtained in a model with a single neutrino @xmath48 splitted in mass @xcite , suggests the limit : @xmath49 this is far also from ( [ nfs ] ) .",
    "( notice that we _ estimated _ the sensitivity of the atmospheric neutrino studies to small mixings ; but , in order to assess precise bounds , it is necessary to go beyond the usually @xcite kept hypothesis of degenerate @xmath28 and @xmath50 )    we offer a theoretical guess for a large value of @xmath51 compatible with both previous bounds , and suggestive of a link between the neutrino mass matrix and the flavour structure : @xmath52 a component of oscillation @xmath53 of this size could be detectable , studying the dependence on the energy cuts of the observed event rates at the super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we are led to the conclusion that only quite specific versions of the ansatz ( [ 1 ] ) for the neutrino masses , where feature @xmath32 is not valid , can reconcile the indications of atmospheric neutrino oscillations with other neutrino anomalies .",
    "we are interested in the specific subset of the mass matrices of type ( [ 1 ] ) that predict the existence of only one neutrino with mass of order @xmath54 we relax the hypothesis of _ non - singularity _ in the `` dominant block '' , introducing a new small parameter @xmath55 such that @xmath56 now , an eigenvalue of the dominant block is order @xmath57    on the theoretical side , we remark that a relatively high degree of tuning is a valuable information on the flavour structure , that goes beyond what is suggested by the nfs or abe models , and in general by the ansatz considered . keeping in mind the seesaw @xcite formula for the light neutrino masses , @xmath58 such",
    "a tuning may suggest us that the determinant of ( a block of ) the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath59 is ( close to ) zero , cfr .",
    "@xcite , or that at leading order only one eigenvalue of the right - handed neutrino mass @xmath60 is sufficiently light to contribute to @xmath61 cfr .",
    "( 10 ) in @xcite ( second paper ) or `` texture @xmath62 '' in @xcite , are equivalent to the mass matrix we are considering , in the limiting case @xmath63 . indeed , in @xcite the connection between neutrino masses and the flavour problem is also considered .",
    "mechanisms to adequately control the flavour structure of the neutrino mass matrix have also been proposed in @xcite .",
    "after changing basis in the dominant block , from @xmath64 to the `` heavy '' and `` light '' states @xmath65 the neutrino mass matrix becomes : @xmath66 where we assumed that the rotation is not a source of suppression for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 entries ( _ no - special - zeroes _ hypothesis ) .",
    "we notice that the heaviest neutrino state , @xmath69 can be integrated away , leaving us a two - flavour task ; the only effect is that the @xmath70 entry receives another contribution , but still of order @xmath71 like for eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the mixing of the heaviest neutrino state with the electron neutrino is of order @xmath72 the discussion related to eq .",
    "( [ verylarge ] ) is still valid .",
    "oscillations of atmospheric neutrino set the mass scale in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) to @xmath73 now we study the possibility of incorporating also solar neutrino oscillations , taking advantage of the parameter @xmath74 for this sake , we first rewrite the effective mixing matrix between the light states , writing explicitly the coefficients of order unity , @xmath75 and @xmath76 : @xmath77 ( @xmath78 is inclusive of the heavier neutrino `` seesaw '' contribution ) .",
    "the relation between the elements of the neutrino mass matrix and the parameters of oscillation in vacuum is : @xmath79 @xmath80 is non - negative , and @xmath81.$ ] the propagation in a medium with electrons density @xmath82 effectively modifies the second term : @xmath83 thus , to have maximal @xmath84 due to the interplay of vacuum and matter terms @xcite we need @xmath85 hence , at @xmath86 the msw mechanism does not work  or in other terms , the case when the singularity of the dominant block is exact ( or very pronounced ) is a special one .",
    "the allowed values of the oscillation parameters are delimited by the two curves : @xmath87 .",

    "the presence of a large mixing is evident from eq .",
    "( [ mmm ] ) , since for such a small @xmath92 the two neutrino states form a quasi - dirac neutrino of mass @xmath94 ( degeneracy being broken at next order in @xmath3 ) . in this region ,",
    "the range of values taken by @xmath95 for fixed @xmath89 is due to the size of @xmath51 from the bracketed term in eq .",
    "( [ reg ] ) ; the shrinking from nfs to the abe value of @xmath3 results clearly in the figure .",
    "the transition from the @xmath96 region , to the `` typical '' small mixing angles , eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , takes place for increasing @xmath92 s .",
    "the large mixing angle solutions of the solar neutrino problems are easy to obtain .",
    "but it is possible to do even better , and reproduce the small mixing angle msw solution ( sma ) at best fit values @xcite if : @xmath97 ( the preliminary sk data on the shape of the electron spectrum tend to disfavour the large angle solutions @xcite ) .",
    "the value in ( [ best ] ) is close to the value obtained in the abe model , but much smaller than in the nfs model ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "it is very well consistent with : @xmath98 correspondingly to eq .",
    "( [ best ] ) , we have @xmath99 this result , @xmath100 tells us that to obtain the sma solution the breaking of the hypothesis of _ no - singularity _ must be weaker than @xmath3 ( more in general , this last condition implies small mixing angles , as it is apparent from eq .",
    "( [ mmm ] ) ) .",
    "the implementation of the small angle solution is not possible in the nfs model ( [ nfs ] ) without special arrangement in the parameters of order unity : a suppression of @xmath76 by a power of @xmath3 ( @xmath101 see eqs .",
    "( [ pars ] ) ) is necessary to hit sma solution .",
    "it is possible in principle that a specific implementation of the nfs model @xcite produces a violation of the _ no - special - zeroes _ hypothesis , but we do nt see the reason for that in the present context .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , since maximal mixing ( @xmath102 ) is permitted , completely averaged neutrino oscillations with survival probability @xmath103 @xcite are possible .",
    "many experimental informations on solar neutrinos can be accounted for in this assumption , with the noticeable exception of the counting rate of the chlorine experiment @xcite and of the spectral shape at sk ( a detailed study is in @xcite ) . for @xmath89",
    "smaller than those represented in the figure , it is possible to reproduce also the vacuum oscillation solution , sometimes called just - so @xcite .",
    "let us now try to discuss the likelihood of the possible solutions we found .",
    "this of course requires to make a priori assumptions , that are however necessary in order to make the model predictive . in this respect",
    ", we remark that if we treat both @xmath3 and @xmath92 as free parameters , _ any _ solar neutrino solution can be fitted ; so we take as references the nfs ( [ nfs ] ) or abe ( [ abe ] ) values of @xmath3 in the following discussion . a criterion for absence of fine - tuning",
    "is that @xmath92 should be _ at most _ of order @xmath51 that leads to a lower limit on @xmath89 : @xmath104 this condition already gives us a lot of freedom : for the nfs model , the large angle mixing ( lma ) is possible ; for the abe model the sma solution is possible . more specifically ,",
    "if the origin of the smallness of @xmath92 and of @xmath3 is the same , we may expect @xmath105 and using eq .",
    "( [ pars ] ) , we conclude that large angles are to be expected in this assumption . the case @xmath106 is interesting , since we can reproduce the lma solution with a value of @xmath3 close to the one of the nfs model ( [ nfs ] ) . now , let us consider values @xmath107 even in this case , we meet a second ( but of course weaker ) fine tuning criterion .",
    "as visible in figure 1 , it is possible to obtain @xmath89 as small as desired , in the region where the two curves become vertical .",
    "this requires , however , a special arrangement between the phases and moduli of @xmath108 and @xmath109 and @xmath110 as one verifies from eqs .",
    "( [ pars ] ) .",
    "the border of the region of parameter space in which it is not necessary to admit this delicate fine tuning can be estimated assuming @xmath111 eqs .",
    "( [ pars ] ) suggest then : @xmath112 now , also the solution denoted as low in @xcite can be incorporated by both nfs and abe models ( figure 1 ) ; similarly , it is possible to find agreement with the low @xmath89 ( and large angle ) solutions that are suggested by the analysis of the sk data alone @xcite .",
    "averaged solutions are `` more natural '' for large values of @xmath3 ( like those in eq .  ( [ verylarge ] ) )",
    ". quite small @xmath3 s , or more fine - tuning , are required to get vacuum oscillation solutions .",
    "summarizing , the `` specific '' form of the ansatz  eq .",
    "( [ 3])is able to incorporate msw solutions of the solar neutrino problem , with large ( nfs model ) or small mixing angle ( abe model ) , or even other possibilities .",
    "we conclude that , in order to state actual predictions , precise values should be given not only for @xmath51 but also for the overall mass scale @xmath24 for @xmath92 and for the coefficients of order unity .",
    "let us consider now a second possibility , in which we simply neglect the solar neutrino problem . in the case",
    "in which the mass scale @xmath4 is large , we can still take advantage of the presence of large mixing angles in the ansatz ( [ 2 ] ) and explain the atmospheric neutrino problem in terms of oscillations , but now a fine tuning must be operated on the parameter @xmath113 : @xmath114 as in section 2 , we assume that this arises as a sort of fine structure of the dominant block . in the terminology of section 1 , we are specifying the general ansatz ( [ 1 ] ) relaxing the _ no - degeneracy _ hypothesis .    in the first variant",
    ", we can use the small mixing angles ( [ 2 ] ) of the electron neutrino with the heavy states to explain the lsnd anomaly @xcite .",
    "this can be done in the nfs model , if @xmath115 ev ( @xmath116 gev ) , that implies for the fine tuning parameter @xmath117 it is not possible , instead , to account for lsnd anomaly in the abe model , since the angle is too small .    in the second variant ,",
    "we consider a larger mass scale , @xmath118 ev , related to two - neutrino hot dark matter component ( 2@xmath119hdm ) , @xmath120 cosmological model @xcite .",
    "this assumption is not consistent with the bounds from reactor experiments @xcite in the model nfs ( @xmath121 should be reduced by one order of magnitude ) , whereas the abe value for @xmath3 is fine , again because of the small mixing angle .",
    "the parameter @xmath113 and the heavy scale @xmath6 are smaller than in the previous case .",
    "the principle of connecting neutrino masses to family structure is very attractive .",
    "a related ansatz for massive neutrinos was discussed , both in its generic form ( [ 1 ] ) ( with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) and in its specific form ( [ 3 ] ) ( with the additional parameters @xmath55 or @xmath113 ) .",
    "the clearest feature of the ansatz considered is about atmospheric neutrinos . due to the smallness of @xmath51 almost pure @xmath0 oscillations",

    "however , it is appealing that the scale is @xmath124 orders of magnitude smaller than the ( minimal su(5 ) ) supersymmetric grand unification scale ( in the variants considered in the previous section , it is even smaller ) .",
    "since , in a predictive model for the scale , there are typically perturbative couplings @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) such that @xmath127 the actual scale @xmath128 is expected to be lower than @xmath129 hence , there is _ a strong suggestion for the existence of an intermediate mass scale , _ possibly right handed neutrinos , even if this is not an unescapable conclusion ( for instance , neutrino masses may be related to a `` direct '' mass term @xcite ) .",
    "we summarize in table 1 other observable features that the ansatz can incorporate , using eqs .",
    "( [ nfs ] ) and ( [ abe ] ) for @xmath51 and using the additional small parameter @xmath92 in second to fourth cases , and @xmath113 in the last two .",

    "the explanation in terms of massive neutrinos of some fact , among 1 ) solar neutrino problem , 2 ) lsnd anomaly or 3 ) dark matter neutrinos , will preclude the explanation of the other ones : the model can be brought to logical contradiction if two ( or three ) facts were proved to be correct . among the particular implications ,",
    "it is interesting that the small mixing angle msw solution can not be implemented in the nfs model without fine - tunings .",
    "models with observable cp violation ( in which the three indications can not be accounted ) are also possible .",
