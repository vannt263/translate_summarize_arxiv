    "the general motivation is the question  where are the fundamental particles corresponding to the other representations of the permutation group ? \" so far , fermions go in totally anti - symmetric representations and bosons go in totally symmetric representations .",
    "but there are mixed representations . particles associated with such representations obey parastatistics @xcite",
    ". the order of the paraparticles is denoted by  @xmath0 \" such that  @xmath1 \" corresponds to the ordinary bosons and fermions . in general , ",
    "@xmath0 \" is the maximum number of parafermions ( parabosons ) that can occur in a totaly symmetric ( anti - symmetric ) state .      from r - parity ,",
    "all supersymmetric particles are assigned a new conserved quantum number @xmath2 so @xmath3 respectively for particles and superparticles .",
    "consequently , superparticles are pair - produced and the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) must be stable .    from locality ,",
    "the selection rules @xcite for the production of paraparticles are similar : transitions with only one external @xmath4 particle are forbidden , so the lightest such particle is stable .",
    "the number of parafermions is conserved modulo 2 . for a @xmath0-even family ,",
    "the number of external lines is even , so an even number of @xmath4 must be produced .  for a @xmath0-odd family ,",
    "the number of external lines can not be an odd number less than @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath5 , then there can not be 3 paraparticles produced .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath6 there is the important exception that while a single paraparticle can not be produced , the production of 3 such particles is allowed .      in the case of susy ,",
    "once the masses are known , the cross - sections are fixed .",
    "for instance , sleptons and electroweak gauginos interact with strength @xmath7  similarly , squarks and gluinos interact with strength @xmath8 .  in leading order in the coupling ,",
    "the corresponding cross - section in the pair - production of two analogous order @xmath0 paraparticles is a factor of @xmath0 larger .  in comparison with susy ,",
    "such a cross - section test can be used to exclude the production of paraparticles .  however",
    ", if a cross - section were found to be a factor of @xmath0 greater than expected , this would be the same prediction as in the case of the production of @xmath0-fold degenerate fermions / bosons .",
    "in particular , there is the issue `` how to distinguish @xmath9 parabosons from two - fold degenerate ordinary bosons ? '' in the case when susy is not involved in the pair - production processes , the magnitude of the cross - sections might not be known apriori , but this same question arises .",
    "the multiplicity signatures for @xmath9 parabosons and ordinary bosons are indeed different .",
    "to show this , we use a parameter - free statistical model @xcite to study multiplicity signatures for coherent production of charged - pairs of parabosons of order @xmath9 in comparison with those arising in the case of ordinary bosons , @xmath1 .",
    "this model gives 3d plots of the pair probability @xmath10@xmath11  the probability of @xmath12 paraboson charged - pairs + @xmath13 positive parabosons \" versus @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "as shown in the figure from ref . [ 3 ] , the @xmath1 curve is found to lie on the relatively narrow 2d @xmath9 surface .",
    "such signatures distinguish between @xmath9 parabosons and two - fold degenerate ordinary bosons , @xmath1 .",
    "circa 1970 , for ordinary bosons horn and silver @xcite constructed the analogous parameter - free statistical model , using conserved - charge coherent states , and showed that it well described inelastic @xmath16 pair production from fixed targets with laboratory kinetic - energies up to 27 gev .",
    "the model agreed with the universal trends of an experimental regularity reported by wang .",
    "horn and silver argued for a statistical treatment of the gross features because ( i ) momentum conservation should be a weak constraint since the emitted pions occupy a small part of the available phase space , ( ii ) total isospin conservation on the distribution of charged pions should also be weak since neutral pions are summed over , and so ( iii ) charge conservation remains as the important constraint .    a charged - paraboson pair in order @xmath9 consists of one a quantum of charge ` + 1 ' and one b quantum of charge ` -1 ' .",
    "the hermitian charge operator is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the parabose number operators .",
    "@xmath19 does not commute with @xmath20 or @xmath21 , and the paraboson pair operators @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath23=0,\\quad \\lbrack q , ba]=0,\\quad \\lbrack ab , ba]=0 $ ] , the @xmath9 conserved - charge coherent state can be defined as a simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath26 unlike in the @xmath1 case @xcite where only one parameter arises , here two complex numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 arise because @xmath29 and @xmath25 are fundamentally distinct operators . consequently , in the following multiplicity considerations , two non - negative parameters occur which are the moduli of these two complex numbers , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these parameters can be interpreted as the intensity strengths of the  @xmath29 \" and  @xmath25 \" sources .",
    "the explicit expressions for the conserved - charge coherent states @xmath32 are given in ref . [ 5 ] . for @xmath13 fixed , the percentage of events with @xmath12 such pairs , @xmath33 , is the square of the moduli of the expansion coefficients of @xmath32 in terms of the two - mode parabose number fock states .",
    "the figure shows the pair - probability @xmath34 for the production of two @xmath35 and one @xmath36 .",
    "the formulas for the @xmath1 curve are for the source - intensity - strength @xmath37 non - negative @xmath38 and for the @xmath9 ribbon are for the intensity strengths @xmath39 , @xmath40 non - negative @xmath41 where the @xmath42 s are modified bessel functions .    in the figure ,",
    "the solid line is the @xmath1 curve .",
    "this @xmath1 curve is also the @xmath43 line on the @xmath44 ribbon . near the peak",
    ", there is a  fold \" at the bottom edge of the ribbon .",
    "as shown , the @xmath9 ribbon consists of open - circles for the non - folded @xmath45 region , and of solid - circles for the folded @xmath46 region .",
    "the upper edge of the ribbon is the @xmath47 set of points .",
    "slightly to the right of the peak , one can see from the solid - circles that each line of dots travelling leftward down the page , bends under ( or  over \" , whichever as the viewer prefers ) the fold to reach the @xmath43 line on the ribbon .    for the cases of @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ", the @xmath1 curve always lies on the @xmath9 two dimensional surface . for @xmath13 odd ,",
    "as shown in the figure , the ribbon is @xmath50 asymmetric and the ribbon is only partly folded over . for @xmath13",
    "even , there is a complete fold @xmath51 of the ribbon because then the @xmath52 and @xmath53 surfaces are identical .",
    "the  line of dots travelling leftward down the page \" in the peak region of the figure are a set of @xmath54 values from a unit - negative - slope diagonal in the @xmath54 domain . in independent - particle - emission models ,",
    "the total energy in the emitted particles is monotonically related to the intensity strength of the source .",
    "this suggests that with the sum @xmath55 fixed , there will be a significant @xmath56 energy dependence in coherent paraboson pair - production .",
    "@xmath57 are respectively the total emitted @xmath58 and @xmath59 quanta s energies .",
    "there is overall @xmath60 symmetry ( @xmath61 charge symmetry ): the  probability for @xmath62 @xmath35 s and @xmath63 @xmath36 s \" equals  probability for @xmath64 @xmath35 s and @xmath65 @xmath36 s \" , because @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68integer .",
    "nevertheless , for q odd , physical observables such as @xmath33 are not symmetric under the @xmath69 exchange of the  @xmath29 \" and  @xmath25 \" intensity strengths .",
