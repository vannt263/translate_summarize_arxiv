    "a random word @xmath5 with letters @xmath6 over some alphabet @xmath7 is _ exchangeable _ if swapping the places of two neighboring letters @xmath8 and @xmath9 does not change the probability .",

    "@xmath1-exchangeable _ if , by swapping the places of two neighboring letters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the probability is multiplied by factor @xmath11 .",
    "the intuitive effect of the deformation is that the arrangement of letters in the word is not completely random , as for exchangeable sequences , but rather there is a tendency for some monotonic pattern . to be definite",
    ", we shall focus temporarily on the instance @xmath12 , in which case , words with smaller numbers of _ inversions _ are more likely , the latter defined as pairs of positions @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the same definitions apply to finite words .",
    "it is well known and easy to see that the most general exchangeable word of fixed length @xmath15 can be produced by first choosing an inversion - free word @xmath16 from an arbitrary probability distribution on the space of weakly increasing sequences over @xmath17 , then shuffling the letters by an independent uniformly random permutation of @xmath18 .",
    "we will show that the general finitely @xmath1-exchangeable word is produced similarly , with the amendment that the random permutation should follow the mallows distribution @xcite , which assigns to each particular permutation @xmath19 probability proportional to @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the number of inversions in @xmath22 .",
    "the analogy between the above exchangeable and @xmath1-exchangeable representations does not extend to infinite words . according to de finetti s theorem @xcite",
    ", an infinite exchangeable @xmath10 satisfies the strong law of large numbers : for fixed @xmath23 , the proportion of letters @xmath24 in the initial subword of length @xmath15 is asymptotic to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a random probability measure on @xmath17 .",
    "conditionally on @xmath26 , the random word is distributed like an i.i.d .",
    "sample from @xmath26 , so the ergodic distributions for @xmath10 are parametrized by probability measures on @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast to that , there is no principal difference between the general representations of finite and infinite @xmath1-exchangeable words . according to our main result ( theorem [ main ] ) ,",
    "every infinite @xmath1-exchangeable @xmath10 can be produced by choosing a random sequence @xmath27 from some arbitrary distribution on the space of infinite increasing sequences over @xmath17 , then shuffling the letters in the order determined by an independent permutation @xmath28 whose distribution is a properly generalized mallows distribution on the group @xmath29 of all bijections of the set @xmath30 .",
    "thus , every ergodic @xmath1-exchangeable distribution for @xmath10 is supported by a single orbit of the group @xmath29 acting on @xmath31 by permutations of coordinates .    proving the stated representation of @xmath1-exchangeable words and analysis of the mallows distribution on @xmath29 constitute the main contents of this paper . for @xmath32",
    ", we show that every @xmath1-exchangeable @xmath10 can be encoded into an increasing random walk on the @xmath33-dimensional lattice with weighted edges ( the @xmath1-pascal pyramid ) ; the ergodic measures are derived , in this case , by solving a boundary problem via path counting and asymptotics of the gaussian multinomial coefficients .    in our recent paper @xcite",
    ", we observed that every homogeneous random subspace of an infinite - dimensional space @xmath34 over a galois field corresponds to a @xmath1-exchangeable sequence over @xmath35 , for @xmath1 reciprocal to the cardinality of the field .",

    "the set of extremes @xmath59 is also borel .",
    "moreover , every measure @xmath60 is uniquely representable as a mixture of the extreme measures , meaning that there exists a unique probability measure @xmath61 on @xmath59 such that @xmath62 for every borel subset @xmath47 .    since the generic element of @xmath57 is a unique mixture of extremes , it is important to describe as explicitly as possible the set of extremes @xmath59 .",
    "a useful criterion is that the extreme measures can be characterized as ergodic measures from @xmath57 .",

    "since the group @xmath39 is countable , the ergodicity is equivalent to the formally stronger condition that every invariant mod 0 subset has measure 0 or 1 .    after these general preliminaries , we focus on a concrete instance .",

    "the function @xmath84 is an _ additive cocycle _ in the sense that @xmath91 equivalently , for @xmath92 , @xmath93 is a multiplicative cocycle . in accordance with the terminology of ergodic theory ,",
    "the additive cocycle @xmath94 may be also called the `` modular function . ''",

    "the key idea is that if @xmath735 is the random output of the infinite @xmath1-shuffle of the word @xmath736 then , as seen from the proof of proposition [ mallows1 ] , the truncated matrix @xmath737 depends only on the first @xmath286 letters of the word @xmath738 ( i.e. , all of the letters @xmath739 become indistinguishable ) .    on the other hand , by virtue of proposition [ monotone ] ,",
