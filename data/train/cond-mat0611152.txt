    "<S> antiferromagnetic - insulating(af - i ) and the ferromagnetic - metallic(fm - m ) phases coexist in various half - doped manganites over a range of temperature and magnetic field , and this is often believed to be an essential ingredient to their colossal magnetoresistence . </S>",
    "<S> we present magnetization and resistivity measurements on pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 and pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath4 showing that the fraction of the two coexisting phases at low - temperature in any specified measuring field h , can be continuously controlled by following designed protocols traversing field - temperature space ; for both materials the fm - m fraction rises under similar cooling paths . constant - field temperature variations however show that the former sample undergoes a 1st order transition from af - i to fm - m with decreasing t , while the latter undergoes the reverse transition . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the observed path - dependent phase - separated states result from the low - t equilibrium phase coexisting with supercooled glass - like high temperature phase , where the low - t equilibrium phases are actually homogeneous fm - m and af - i phases respectively for the two materials .    </S>",
    "<S> half - doped perovskite manganites with general formula ( r@xmath0a@xmath0)mno@xmath3 ( where r is rare - earth and a is alkaline - earth elements ) belong to a class of materials where transformation from antiferromagnetic ( af)-insulating ( i ) to ferromagnetic ( fm)- metallic ( m ) phase can be triggered by variation of temperature and magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetrically incompatible competing orders are separated by a first order phase transition ( fopt ) that may be caused by varying control variables like temperature or field , triggering giant response in some physical properties , magnetoresistance being the most prominent of these . </S>",
    "<S> the half doped manganites are intrinsically disordered because of randomness in r / a site . </S>",
    "<S> early theoretical work predicted that such quenched disorder would give rise to a landscape of free - energies , resulting in spatial distribution of the coexisting phases @xcite ; strain - induced phase coexistence has also been proposed in manganites @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such disorders endow a finite broadening to the transition causing a coexistence of two phases with different order parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> existence of such a spatial distribution of coexisting phases , and its alteration with the control variables across disorder - broadened fopt in diverse systems have been demonstrated using a variety of probes @xcite . outside the broadened transition region </S>",
    "<S> , a canonical system recovers the respective homogeneous phases completely , and attains equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> however , this inhomogeneous phase coexistence persists to the lowest temperature in many materials @xcite , leading to theoretical work proposing interesting equilibrium phases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> often the initial state is not recovered after going through a full cycle of the control variable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in many manganites around half doping that once af - i phase is converted to fm - m phase by the application of external magnetic field at low temperatures , the system does not go back to starting phase when the field is withdrawn @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar asymmetry is observed recently with the cycling of temperature in fixed field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these give clear evidence that the reverse transformation is hindered and the initial zero - field cooled ( zfc ) state is not recovered completely , resulting in a zero field state with two coexisting phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the so - called robust charge ordered manganites with narrow one - electron bandwidth like pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath4 or nd@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath4 show af - i to fm - m transition in high pulsed magnetic field ( @xmath5200 koe ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the charge ordering is weakened by small substitution in the mn - site of pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath4 , the field induced af - i to fm - m transition occurs at accessible static field ranges and show striking effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we present here high - field magnetization and resistivity studies on pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 and the wider bandwidth compound pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these functional properties , at a specified field at low - t , can be tuned by following novel paths in h - t space . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the observed path - dependent phase - separated states are glass - like states where kinetics is arrested . </S>",
    "<S> conventional measurements mask the simple equilibrium phase diagram  </S>",
    "<S> the arrest of dynamics masks thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> these results have general applicability to first - order magnetic transition in systems with intrinsic disorder , including intermetallic alloys , which show glass - like freezing of higher - temperature long - range - order phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , similar studies on such materials would shed light on the physics of glass formation since magnetic field can be tuned easily compared to external pressure used for conventional studies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> polycrystalline sample of pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 was prepared by solid - state reaction . </S>",
    "<S> details of the sample preparation and characterization can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> [ 25 ] . </S>",
    "<S> polycrystalline sample of pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 was prepared by solid - state route with starting materials having purity at least 99.99% . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements are done using a rigaku rotaflex rtc 300 rc powder diffractometer with cu k@xmath6 radiation from rotating anode x - ray generator ( 18 kw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the xrd data is analyzed by rietveld profile refinement and samples are found to be in single crystallographic phase , without any detectable impurity phase . </S>",
    "<S> iodometric redox titration is performed to estimate the mn@xmath7/mn@xmath8 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the samples are found to be half doped within the detection limit . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity and magnetic measurements are performed using commercial set - ups ( 14tesla - ppms - vsm , m / s . </S>",
    "<S> quantum design , usa ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 1a and 1b show data at 5k for pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the isothermal m - h at 5 k shows that zfc af state transforms to fm state with increase in field above 55 koe , but the initial af state does not recover when the field is reduced from 140 koe to zero . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent h - increasing curve shows no signature of the af - to - fm transition , indicating that the remanent state is fully fm . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the resistivity vs h measured at 5 k after zfc shows that the resistance , which was above our measurement limit at h=0 , becomes measurable and decreases by orders of magnitude with the increase in h indicating an insulator to metal like change . </S>",
    "<S> however , the initial high resistance value is not recovered when the field is reduced to zero , implying the stabilization of the metallic phase once it is produced . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the magnetization data , and there is no further conversion with field cycling . </S>",
    "<S> these two measurements at 5 k show that the h - induced fm - m state is ( meta)stable under large excursions in h at 5 k. softening of this anomaly is observed at 40 k in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) indicating part conversion to the zfc af - i state . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively similar behavior is observed at 5 k for other half doped manganites having wider bandwidth than pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath3 and different spin , orbital and charge order like pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d . for all these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the virgin m - h or r - h curves are not traced in subsequent field increasing cycles . </S>",
    "<S> the original homogeneous zfc state transforms into an inhomogeneous state and shows phase coexistence even in zero field . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that such anomalies are also observed in variety of systems like doped intermetallic alloys or giant magnetocaloric compound and is attributed to the interruption of the first - order transformation process by critically slow dynamics similar to glass like freezing of the supercooled high temperature phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon of hindered transformation or kinetic arrest is also reported in charge ordered la - pr - ca - mn - o @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more vivid manifestation of this non - ergodicity are portrayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 which show different path - dependent magnetization and conductivity values at same temperature and field for both pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 and pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 . magnetization and resistivity data is obtained at 5 k after cooling each time from 320 k to 5 k , but in different cooling fields . </S>",
    "<S> the field is then varied isothermally to the specified measuring value . </S>",
    "<S> data is shown in fig . 2 for two values of measuring field , and various values of cooling field . </S>",
    "<S> data has been collected for many more values of measuring field , and shows similar behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> we find the general result for both samples that cooling in high field gives an increasing fm - m component , and this appears to be a generic feature of manganites around half doping . </S>",
    "<S> these path - dependent values clearly show the tuneable coexistence of distinct electronic and magnetic phases .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown in fig 2 that observed physical properties depend drastically but controllably on the field - temperature path followed to reach the measuring field and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this presents a novel ability to control functional properties . </S>",
    "<S> we now show that in spite of this apparent commonality between these two different half doped systems the underlying fopt is very different . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3a and 3b show the thermal hysteresis in magnetization , indicating a broad hysteretic first - order transition , in 10 koe field for pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 and pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we mention here that the conductivity also shows signatures of the corresponding fopt . </S>",
    "<S> thus the complex low temperature behaviour of these two half - doped manganites in field - temperature plane can be categorized in two groups . for one group [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ] , the high - temperature phase is af - i whereas for other [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ] it is fm - m . in spite of these contrasting 1st order transitions , </S>",
    "<S> the path - dependent effects depicted in figures 1 and 2 are similar .    to develop some unified understanding about the complex behaviour of field - temperature induced coexisting phases from simple representations , we redraw the recently proposed heuristic phase diagram for the two groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder broadening of fopt results in broadening of the supercooling ( h * , t * ) and superheating ( h * * , t * * ) spinodals to bands . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic arrest akin to the glass transition line would also broaden into ( h@xmath9 , t@xmath9 ) band because of disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sign of the slopes of ( h * , t * ) and ( h * * , t * * ) bands are decided from the fact that the ferromagnetic phase exists over larger temperature range in higher fields . </S>",
    "<S> the same for the ( h@xmath9 , t@xmath9 ) band is decided by the fact that if increase in temperature causes de - arrest to af ( fm ) state , then isothermal de - arrest must be observed on lowering ( raising ) the field . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c is for the case showing first - order transformation from higher temperature af phase to fm at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> materials like pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 , following fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c , would show a homogeneous af phase on cooling in zero field , completely masking the fopt to the fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case for the magnetocaloric gd@xmath10ge@xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain from the phase diagram that cooling in fields above h@xmath12 results in full transformation to equilibrium fm - m phase , whereas cooling in field below h@xmath13 results in completely frozen af - i state . </S>",
    "<S> cooling in fields between h@xmath12 and h@xmath13 can generate a continuum of states with varying faction of metastable af - i phase . </S>",
    "<S> the af - i fraction remains constant in subsequent isothermal field variations provided one stays below the ( h@xmath9 , t@xmath9 ) band , explaining the data in figures 2a and 2b . </S>",
    "<S> measurements following unusual paths in the temperature - field plane are essential to unravel the zero field equilibrium fm phase . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3d shows the h - t schematic for the case when high temperature fm phase transforms to af phase at low temperature and represents systems like pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 , nd@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 @xcite etc . </S>",
    "<S> thus figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3c and 3d encompasses wide range of half doped manganites and also other systems which show similar field temperature induced first - order transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the salient features of the proposed phase diagrams thus are : ( i ) cooling across ( h@xmath9 , t@xmath9 ) band would freeze the supercooled higher temperature phase ; ( ii ) warming across this would de - arrest the frozen phase and ( iii)traversing this band in similar sense at a fixed temperature would accordingly result in arrest or de - arrest of the higher temperature phase . </S>",
    "<S> the significant outcome of figs . 3c and 3d are that cooling the system between fields h@xmath13 and h@xmath12 can produce a continuum of coexisting phase fractions . cooling in fields below h@xmath13 or above h@xmath12 results in two different homogeneous phases . </S>",
    "<S> one of which is in equilibrium and the other is in frozen metastable state , but both persist down to the lowest temperature . for the cases of both figs . 3c and 3d the coexisting phase fractions </S>",
    "<S> can be tuned in a qualitatively similar manner , but the behavior of these states on warming are contrasting . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3e and 3f show the magnetization behaviour for pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 and pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 respectively , while warming in a fixed field ( h@xmath14 ) after cooling to 5 k in different fields ( h@xmath15 ) </S>",
    "<S> . larger fraction of metastable higher - temperature phase is frozen in pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 ( pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 ) while cooling in lower ( higher ) fields . </S>",
    "<S> we observe two sharp changes of opposite sign during warming when [ h@xmath14 - h@xmath15 ] is positive ( negative ) , and this is ascribed to de - arrest of the frozen phase at the ( h@xmath9 , t@xmath9 ) band , followed by the fopt of the equilibrium low - temperature phase at the superheating band . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> cooling in higher ( lower ) fields for pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1al@xmath2o@xmath3 ( pr@xmath0sr@xmath0mno@xmath3 ) gives lower fraction of metastable frozen phase , and the sharp change signifying de - arrest does not become observable in the measurement time scale . </S>",
    "<S> this is a detail , which correlates the broadening of the ( h * , t * ) and the ( h@xmath9 , t@xmath9 ) bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the lack of de - arrest reported here is as observed on short time scale , and does not imply that the system is in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> long - time relaxation is seen as expected for all the metastable states @xcite .    to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> our measurements show that the lack of dynamics triumphs over thermodynamics at the magnetic fopt in the sample studied , resulting in an apparently complex phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the tangled web @xcite can be unraveled by extensively traversing various paths in h - t plane as per our protocol @xcite , to obtain the equilibrium phase diagram ; zero - field measurements or isothermal field variations ( as in fig . 1 ) are not conclusive . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that intrinsic disorders including strains @xcite can broaden the supercooling band and cause a finite overlap with the ( h@xmath9 , t@xmath9 ) band at zero field . </S>",
    "<S> this would give rise to coexisting phases even on zfc for both figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3c and 3d . </S>",
    "<S> these phase diagrams can qualitatively explain various anomalies observed not just in half - doped manganites but also in a variety of magnetocaloric , martensitic , and other intermetallic materials . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that our conclusions would be vindicated by more direct mesoscopic measurements like micro - hall probe scans , magnetic - force microscopy , xrd , etc which would have to be performed in high magnetic field .    </S>",
