    "we consider a particular class of exact solutions of einstein s equations which describe impulsive gravitational or matter waves in a de  sitter or an anti - de  sitter background .",
    "one class of such solutions has recently been derived by hotta and tanaka @xcite and analysed in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this was initially obtained by boosting the source of the schwarzschild(anti-)de  sitter solution in the limit in which its speed approaches that of light while its mass is reduced to zero in an appropriate way . in a de  sitter background ,",
    "the resulting solution describes a spherical impulsive gravitational wave generated by two null particles propagating in opposite directions . in an anti - de  sitter background which contains closed timelike lines ,",
    "the impulsive wave is located on a hyperboloidal surface at any time and the source is a single null particle with propagates from one side of the universe to the other and then returns in an endless cycle .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a more general class of such solutions .",
    "the global structure of the space - times and the shape of the impulsive wave surfaces are exactly as summarised above and described in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we consider a wider range of possible sources .",
    "we present an interesting class of impulsive gravitational waves that are also generated by null particles , but these particles in general can have an arbitrary multipole structure .",
    "the space - times are conformal to the impulsive limit of a family of type  n solutions of kundt s class  @xcite .",
    "when the cosmological constant is negative , the solutions given here can be related to the impulsive limit of a class of solutions previously given by siklos  @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that a family of impulsive spherical gravitational waves have also been obtained by hogan @xcite .",
    "these are particular ( impulsive ) cases of the robinson  trautman family of solutions with a cosmological constant .",
    "they will be discussed further elsewhere and are not related to the solutions given here .",
    "as is well known , the de  sitter and anti - de  sitter space - times can naturally be represented as four - dimensional hyperboloids embedded in five - dimensional minkowski spaces .",
    "impulsive waves can easily be introduced into these space - times using this formalism .",
    "this is done is section  2 in which the form of the solution is constructed explicitly and the nature of its source is described .",
    "appropriate coordinate systems for the separate cases of de  sitter and anti - de  sitter backgrounds are described respectively in sections 3 and  4 together with a discussion of the geometrical properties of the waves .",
    "their relation to previously known solutions is indicated in section  5 .",
    "we wish to consider impulsive waves in a de  sitter or an anti - de  sitter background . in these cases ,",
    "the background can be represented as a four - dimensional hyperboloid @xmath0 embedded in a five - dimensional minkowski space - time @xmath1 where @xmath2 for a cosmological constant @xmath3 , @xmath4 for a de  sitter background ( @xmath5 ) , and @xmath6 for an anti - de  sitter background ( @xmath7 ) in which there are two timelike coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let us now consider a plane impulsive wave in this 5-dimensional minkowski background .",
    "without loss of generality , we may consider this to be located on the null hypersurface given by @xmath10 so that the surface has constant curvature . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the impulsive wave is a 2-sphere in the 5-dimensional minkowski space at any time @xmath8 .",
    "alternatively , for @xmath6 , it is a 2-dimensional hyperboloid .",
    "the geometry of these surfaces has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite using various natural coordinate systems .    in this five - dimensional notation",
    ", we consider the class of complete space - times that contain an impulsive wave on this background and that can be represented in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is determined on the wave surface ( [ e2.5 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath13 must be a function of two parameters which span the surface .",
    "an appropriate parameterisation of this surface is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 when @xmath4 and @xmath16 when @xmath6 .",
    "in terms of these parameters , it can be shown that the function @xmath17 must satisfy the linear partial differential equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the source of the wave .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that this equation arises in such a similar form for both de  sitter and anti - de  sitter backgrounds .",
    "this equation will be derived separately for both cases in the following sections .    it may immediately be observed that a solution of ( [ e2.8 ] ) of the form @xmath20  const . represents a uniform distribution of null matter over the impulsive surface .",
    "this may always be added to any other non - trivial solution . however , from now on we will only consider solutions which are vacuum everywhere except for some possible isolated sources .",
    "let us now consider solutions that can be separated in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a real constant . since @xmath23 is a periodic coordinate it follows that , for continuous solutions ( except possibly at the poles @xmath24 ) , @xmath22 must be a non - negative integer . for a vacuum solution with this condition , ( [ e2.8 ] )",
    "reduces to an associated legendre equation @xmath25 this has the general solution @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are associated legendre functions of the first and second kind of degree  1 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the only possible nonsingular solutions involve the associated legendre functions of the first kind .",
    "these are nonzero here only for @xmath31 , and the solutions are given by @xmath32 or any linear combination of them .",
    "it may then be observed that the second of the above expressions can be obtained from the first by a simple `` rotation '' of the coordinates on the wave surface ( [ e2.5 ] ) , so that they are essentially the same solution .",
    "we can thus restrict attention to the space - time ( [ e2.6 ] ) with @xmath33 .",
    "it can then be shown that this case is conformally flat . the impulsive component in ( [ e2.6 ] )",
    "can be removed by the discontinuous linear transformation @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the heaviside step function .",
    "( this does not introduce impulsive components into the weyl tensor . ) thus , these nonsingular solutions represent only the de  sitter or anti - de  sitter backgrounds in different coordinates . in these backgrounds , there is no equivalent to the plane impulsive gravitational wave ( for @xmath38 ) for which the weyl tensor has constant components over the wave surface .",
    "it now follows that the only nontrivial solution of ( [ e2.9 ] ) involves the legendre functions of the second kind .",
    "these necessarily have singularities at @xmath24 which may correspond to poles at which the sources of the impulsive wave may be located .",

    "moreover , since @xmath64 on the wave , it can be seen from ( [ e3.2 ] ) that at any time the area of the spherical wavefront spanned by @xmath88 and @xmath23 is a constant equal to @xmath89 .",

    "the geometrical properties of these waves have been described elsewhere @xcite using different coordinate systems . basically , the impulsive wave is hyperboloidal and is generated by a single null particle moving in an anti - de  sitter background which contains closed timelike geodesics .",
