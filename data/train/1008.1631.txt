    "in recent years the discovery of graphene , @xcite a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice , stimulated an unprecedented interest from physicists belonging to different communities .",
    "electrons in graphene behave as massless dirac fermions , as confirmed by their peculiar quantum hall effect .",
    "@xcite in parallel , graphene represents the only existing two - dimensional ( 2d ) conducting membrane embedded in 3d space .",
    "this feature became most prominent with the experimental realisation of suspended graphene devices .",
    "@xcite the latter allow for the investigation of the intrinsic properties of the material , unperturbed by the presence of a substrate .",
    "thus , suspended graphene offers the unique possibility of exploring a system involving at once features of quantum - electrodynamics as well as of hard and soft condensed matter physics .",
    "@xcite    for a long time the very existence of 2d membranes was thought to be impossible @xcite due to their tendency towards spontaneous crumpling .",
    "indeed , at harmonic level , the elastic theory of flat 2d membranes yields divergent fluctuations of the angles of the normal vectors to the membrane , due to thermal fluctuations of flexural ( out - of - plane ) phonons .",
    "it was later understood that the non - linear coupling between stretching and bending energies hardens the bending stiffness at long wavelengths and stabilises the flat phase .",
    "@xcite    it was soon realised that mechanical deformations of graphene sheets affect the electronic properties by inducing coexistent scalar and ( fictitious or synthetic ) gauge fields in the effective low - energy dirac hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite recently this issue became of special relevance and stimulated the emergence of the so - called strain - engineering community , aimed at controlling the electronic properties of graphene by suitably engineering the deformations .",
    "suspended membranes show flexural deformations which are typically extremely soft compared to in - plane ones . it may be tempting to conclude that the former should dominate the low - energy electromechanical properties of suspended graphene due to their large density of states .",
    "this effect is balanced by the strength of the electron - phonon coupling in graphene .",
    "while in - plane phonons show a conventional linear coupling , the intrinsic electron - phonon coupling of the flexural modes is quadratic .",
    "@xcite this feature is protected by the reflection symmetry with respect to the plane , as the effect of out - of - plane modes can not depend on the sign of the deformations .",
    "thus , we find an interesting competition between hard - to - excite but strongly - coupled in - plane phonons and soft but weakly - coupled flexural ones .    from an experimental point of view , this competition can be addressed , e.g. , by transport measurements analyzing the temperature dependent resistivity @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , at high enough electron concentrations and for not too low temperatures ( where quantum effects become prominent @xcite ) , @xmath3 is ascribed to electron - phonon scattering .",
    "recent measurements @xcite show a @xmath3 scaling linearly with temperature @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour is compatible with the expectations for longitudinal in - plane phonons @xcite at @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 the related bloch - grneisen temperature ) as if the flexural phonon contribution were irrelevant .",
    "in addition , non - suspended samples @xcite show a density independent @xmath3 while suspended graphene @xcite exhibit a density dependence which has not been addressed so far . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we investigated the low - temperature dependence of the resistivity of suspended graphene in the absence of tension and found that flexural modes should actually dominate over the in - plane ones yielding a @xmath6 dependence .",
    "motivated by the experimental puzzles above , here we further analyse the different contributions of in - plane vs flexural phonons to the temperature dependent resistivity by exploring the high - temperature regime and addressing further issues related to non - universal factors , like contact - induced tension in the membrane .",
    "in particular we investigate whether flexural modes keep dominating the @xmath0-dependence of the resistivity also at high temperatures and how tension affects their contribution with respect to in - plane phonons .",
    "we discuss the dependence of the resistivity on temperature as well as on electron density in light of the recent experimental findings .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : basics ] we introduce the basic description of the electronic and phononic properties of graphene to be employed in the rest of the manuscript . in sec .",
    "[ sec : resistivity ] we discuss the in - plane vs flexural phonon contributions to the resistivity within a boltzmann approach .",
    "we deduce the temperature and density dependence of the resistivity @xmath7 in the different regimes where acoustic phonons are relevant",
    ". we also comment on the effect of screening in the density dependence of the electron - phonon resistivity . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we consider the scattering between electrons in graphene and long - wavelength phonon modes .",
    "we can thus treat the two dirac cones independently and focus on the effective low energy dirac hamiltonian @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the fermi velocity and the 2d wavevector @xmath10 is measured from the relevant dirac point .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "the components of the vector @xmath13 are the pauli matrices in the sublattice space .",
    "the real spin degree of freedom does not play a role here and will be ignored .",

    "their real space representation is @xmath17 ) \\exp [ i{\\bf k}\\cdot { \\bf r}]$ ] , with @xmath18 the position vector in the 2d plane and @xmath19 the angle of the vector @xmath20 with respect to the @xmath21-axis fixed along the armchair direction of the graphene lattice .",
    "the mechanical distortions of graphene are described by the vector field @xmath22 and by the scalar field @xmath23 associated with in - plane and flexural ( out - of - plane ) deformations , respectively .",
    "the physics of the mechanical distortions is captured by the elastic lagrangian density @xmath24 with contributions coming from stretching and bending energies . here",

    "@xcite notice that the @xmath32 term breaks rotational symmetry which would be obeyed in the absence of tension .    in the harmonic approximation the lagrangian above yields two in - plane phonon modes ( longitudinal @xmath33 and transverse @xmath34 ) and one flexural branch ( @xmath35 ) with dispersions @xmath36 and group velocities @xmath37^{1/2}\\simeq 2\\cdot 10 ^ 4_{}\\ , { \\rm",

    "in contrast , flexural modes have a quadratic dispersion in the absence of tension .",
    "tension introduces a new wavevector scale @xmath40 discriminating a tension - induced linear dispersion at low momenta from the quadratic dependence at @xmath41 @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "correspondingly , the density of states ( dos ) for in - plane modes is linear in energy @xmath45 while that for flexural phonons is linear in energy up to @xmath46 and independent of energy for @xmath47 . as we will show , the dos reduction induced by tension is the basic mechanism suppressing the contribution of flexural phonons relative to the tension - independent in - plane ones .    in the following",
    "it will be useful to fourier transform the phononic displacements @xmath48 ( with @xmath49 ) as @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the normal modes can then be expressed as @xmath51 with @xmath52^{1/2}_{}$ ] the oscillator length , @xmath53 the annihilation operator for the mode @xmath54 at wavenumber @xmath55 and @xmath56 the total oscillator mass per unit area .",
    "in this paper we focus on intrinsic coupling mechanisms between electrons and phonons due to the effect of deformations on the electronic hamiltonian .",
    "other sample - specific mechanisms exist , e.g. due to the capacitive coupling between a back - gate and electrons in suspended graphene or due to buckling of the membrane ( which breaks the reflection symmetry of the membrane ) , but these are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the intrinsic coupling between electrons and deformations is related to the variation of areas and lengths induced in the membrane by specific distortions . as the variations of length or area",
    "are described by the components of the strain tensor , @xcite by examining its form in ( [ strain ] ) one readily concludes that in - plane phonons have a linear coupling to electrons while flexural phonons have a quadratic one , as long as the reflection symmetry with respect to the plane is not broken .",
    "we point out that the breaking of reflection symmetry ( e.g. via capacitive coupling or via buckling ) would yield a non - universal linear coupling for flexural modes . in the presence of tension",
    "this would effectively result in a sample - specific contribution to the resistivity with identical parametric dependences as for in - plane phonons .",
    "in more detail , the representation of the electron - phonon coupling in the electronic dirac description of a single valley is given by @xcite @xmath57 \\\\g_{2}^{}f[u_{ij}^ { } ] & g_{1}^{}(u_{xx}+u_{yy})\\end{array}\\right)\\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath58=2u_{xy}+i ( u_{xx}-u_{yy})$ ] .",
    "the diagonal part of the coupling constitutes a scalar deformation potential originating from local area variations .",
    "the corresponding bare coupling constant has been estimated to be @xcite @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , distortions which induce no variation of local areas ( e.g. pure shear modes ) would still couple to electrons via the induced bond - length modulations .",
    "these affect the hopping amplitudes between neighbouring carbon atoms and induce the off - diagonal terms of eq .",
    "( [ velph ] ) corresponding to a fictitious ( or synthetic ) gauge field in the dirac equation .",
    "the corresponding coupling constant has been estimated to be @xcite @xmath60 which is about an order of magnitude weaker than the deformation potential coupling . in the following",
    ", we will assume that these estimates are at least roughly correct .",
    "however , we emphasize that it would be straightforward to adapt our results to situations where this inequality no longer holds .",
    "it should be noticed however that the deformation potential , contrary to the gauge field coupling , is affected by electronic screening @xcite which reduces the coupling constant @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath62 is the wavevector transferred in the electron - phonon coupling , thomas - fermi screening of the deformation potential yields the coupling constant @xmath63 with @xmath64 , @xmath65 the 2d coulomb interaction and @xmath66 the fermionic polarization .",
    "the thomas - fermi screening wavevector @xmath67 is expressed via the fine structure constant of graphene @xmath68 and the electronic dos at the fermi level @xmath69 , with @xmath70 due to the spin and valley degeneracy . for small wavevectors",
    "@xmath71 the deformation potential coupling is thus strongly suppressed .",
    "we can identify a crossover wavevector @xmath72 below which the gauge field coupling dominates over the deformation potential .    in summary , the longitudinal in - plane and flexural modes , as they induce local variations of area , couple to electrons via both the deformation potential and the gauge field mechanisms , while transverse in - plane phonons involve pure shear and couple only via the gauge field . at wavevector @xmath62",
    ", these phonon modes are characterized by the coupling matrices @xmath73 with @xmath74 in the dirac description . for flexural modes @xmath75 , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 the wavevectors of the two flexural phonons . in the matrices above @xmath78 ,",

    "we now address the electron - phonon contribution to the resistivity of suspended graphene .",
    "it is believed that this yields the dominant temperature dependence of the resistivity for the regime of high temperatures involved in recent experiments @xcite ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "further mechanisms contributing to the temperature dependence of the resistivity discussed in the literature focus on the ballistic regime , @xcite on the @xmath0-dependent screening of coulomb impurities , @xcite or on the combined effects of electron - electron interactions and atomic - scale impurities .",
    "@xcite    we focus on the high electron density regime where the fermi wavevector @xmath84 is larger than the inverse mean free path due to disorder and electron - phonon scattering . in this regime",
    "a quasiclassical boltzmann approach to transport can be employed .",
    "the linearized boltzmann equation for the electronic distribution function @xmath85 in presence of a constant electric field @xmath86 has the standard form @xcite @xmath87 with @xmath88 the electron charge and @xmath89 the electron velocity .",

    "this can be understood as follows . in absorption processes",
    ", it is only these phonons that have a large enough equilibrium occupation , while in emission processes , electrons can transfer at most an energy of order @xmath132 to the phonons due to the fermi distribution .",

    "( [ golden ] ) demands energy conservation involving only the incoming and outgoing electron energies at the fermi level .",

    "[ onshell ] ]     + we thus conclude that the phonon - induced resistivity exhibits a number of temperature regimes in suspended graphene , for two reasons : the first reason is conventional and is associated with the bloch - grneisen temperature @xmath139 . when @xmath140 , large angle scattering is possible while , at @xmath141 , only small - angle scattering is relevant .",
    "the second reason is specific to graphene and is associated with the screening dependence of the relevant electron - phonon coupling mechanism . if @xmath140 , screening hardly affects the dominant deformation potential contribution to the resistivity , while , at small enough temperatures , it suppresses the deformation potential in favour of the gauge field coupling .",
    "indeed , in the high temperature regime @xmath142 the sum over phonon momenta is cut off at @xmath143 and scattering at all angles is possible .",
    "consequently , screening does not significantly affect the deformation potential coupling .",
    "the latter yields the dominant contribution to the resistivity for longitudinal phonons with @xmath144 while transverse modes depend only on the unscreened gauge field coupling .",
    "in contrast , in the regime @xmath145 , the sum is cut off at @xmath146 ( with @xmath147 ) .",
    "this constraint implies dominant small angle scattering ( @xmath148 ) , and the term @xmath149 therefore yields the factor @xmath150 .",
    "in addition , in this regime the deformation potential coupling for longitudinal phonons is strongly screened .",
    "we thus identify an intermediate regime for @xmath151 ( with @xmath152 ) where small angle scattering is accompanied by a dominant deformation potential .",
    "finally , at low - temperatures @xmath153 the scattering rate is dominated by the unscreened gauge field coupling .",
    "as screening does not affect the coupling for transverse phonons , the latter do not show an intermediate temperature regime .",
    "we first turn to the transport scattering rate due to longitudinal in - plane phonons which couple to the carriers through both , a gauge field and the deformation potential .",
    "the deformation potential contribution to the scattering rate has been analysed before for monolayer @xcite and bilayer graphene .",
    "@xcite note however , that while the deformation potential is believed to have a larger bare coupling constant , it is suppressed at long wavelengths due to screening for nonzero doping .",

    "the dominant contributions to the scattering rate ( [ golden ] ) in the various temperature regimes therefore are @xmath155 with @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 a function fulfilling @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the @xmath161 dependence for @xmath162 is due to the gauge field coupling .",
    "it is analogous to the @xmath163 dependence ( bloch law ) for @xmath164 in three dimensions , @xcite the difference in the power law stemming from the reduced dimensionality of momentum space .",
    "+ in the intermediate temperature regime , @xmath165 , the screened deformation potential dominates over the gauge field coupling .",
    "the @xmath166 dependence originates from the combined effects of screening and small angle scattering .",
    "+ finally , the linear temperature dependence for @xmath167 stems from the high - temperature expansion of the bose distribution .",
    "since the typical momentum transfers in this regime are of order @xmath143 , it is associated with the essentially unscreened deformation potential .",
    "this regime turns out to be the most relevant for the interpretation of recent measurements . @xcite",
    "the analysis above can be extended to transverse in - plane phonons .",
    "these have a slightly smaller group velocity than longitudinal modes and couple only via the gauge field mechanism , so that screening is not relevant . as a result , the intermediate regime in eq .",

    "recent experiments in graphene highlighted the contribution to the resistivity due to electron - phonon scattering @xmath7 at @xmath167 .",
    "@xcite in this regime , using our estimates above , the resistivity due to scattering by in - plane phonons , @xmath171 , is dominated by the deformation potential coupling of longitudinal modes and is given by @xmath172 in terms of the rescaled quantities @xmath173 and @xmath174 . the contribution to the resistivity due to in - plane phonons is thus linear in temperature and independent of the electron concentration for @xmath167 .",

    "@xcite suspended graphene devices @xcite likewise show a linear @xmath0 dependence , compatible with in - plane phonons , but accompanied by an unexpected electron - density dependence not captured by our analysis above .",
    "in particular , for increasing electron concentration the resistivity has been observed to decrease and finally saturate to the in - plane phonon contribution ( [ rhoin ] ) at large densities .    while it may be tempting to think that this behaviour originates from the screening of the deformation potential at increasing electron density , our analysis shows that this is not the case .",
    "indeed , for @xmath175 , @xmath176 is cut off at @xmath143 .",
    "this , together with the fact that @xmath177 , implies that the screening factor in ( [ screening ] ) does not introduce any additional density - dependence into the scattering rate .",
    "moreover , if this was a relevant effect , it should appear in non - suspended samples as well .",
    "the in - plane phonon contribution ( [ rhoin ] ) seems sufficient to describe the behaviour of non - suspended samples , where flexural ( out - of - plane ) deformations are suppressed by the direct contact with a substrate . in graphene samples on very rough substrates small out - of - plane fluctuations could still survive due to the non - perfect adhesion of the membrane to the surface of the substrate .",
    "in contrast , flexural phonons can become relevant in suspended devices .",
    "we now turn to analyse their effect along the same line as for the in - plane modes above .",
    "the analysis of the resistivity due to flexural phonon modes is more involved due to the presence of two phonons with wavevectors @xmath178 and @xmath179 at each interaction vertex .",
    "these yield four possible processes involving double absorption , double emission or mixed absorption - emission terms in the scattering rate .",
    "in addition , four relevant wavevector scales come into play , namely @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath84 , related to temperature ( @xmath183 ) , screening , tension , and electron concentration , respectively . a further ultraviolet scale , corresponding to a debye energy of order @xmath184 ,",

    "we point out that , due to the negative thermal expansion coefficient of graphene , tension in real suspended samples is itself temperature - dependent .",
