    "<S> ngc2264 is a young galactic cluster and the dominant component of the mon ob1 association lying approximately 760 pc distant within the local spiral arm . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster is hierarchically structured , with subclusters of suspected members spread across several parsecs . </S>",
    "<S> associated with the cluster is an extensive molecular cloud complex spanning more than two degrees on the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the combined mass of the remaining molecular cloud cores upon which the cluster is superposed is estimated to be at least @xmath03.7@xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> star formation is ongoing within the region as evidenced by the presence of numerous embedded clusters of protostars , molecular outflows , and herbig - haro objects . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar population of ngc2264 is dominated by the o7 v multiple star , s  mon , and several dozen b - type zero - age main sequence stars . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray imaging surveys , h@xmath4 emission surveys , and photometric variability studies have identified more than 600 intermediate and low - mass members distributed throughout the molecular cloud complex , but concentrated within two densely populated areas between s  mon and the cone nebula . </S>",
    "<S> estimates for the total stellar population of the cluster range as high as 1000 members and limited deep photometric surveys have identified @xmath0230 substellar mass candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the median age of ngc2264 is estimated to be @xmath03 myr by fitting various pre - main sequence isochrones to the low - mass stellar population , but an apparent age dispersion of at least @xmath05 myr can be inferred from the broadened sequence of suspected members . </S>",
    "<S> infrared and millimeter observations of the cluster have identified two prominent sites of star formation activity centered near ngc2264 irs1 , a deeply embedded early - type ( b2b5 ) star , and irs2 , a star forming core and associated protostellar cluster . ngc2264 and </S>",
    "<S> its associated molecular clouds have been extensively examined at all wavelengths , from the centimeter regime to x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> given its relative proximity , well - defined stellar population , and low foreground extinction , the cluster will remain a prime candidate for star formation studies throughout the foreseeable future . </S>"
