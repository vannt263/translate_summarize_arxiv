    "both natural language texts and coding dna sequences present power laws in the observed frequency of a word as a function of its rank ( @xmath0 ) , where the rank is just the ordinal position of a word if all words are ordered according to their decreasing frequency .",
    "usually , the most frequent word has rank @xmath1 , the next most frequent rank @xmath2 and so on . this power law behavior of the ranking is known as the zipf law @xcite , and it is very common in physics , biology , geography , economics , linguistics , etc . @xcite . in physics",
    "one can cite the rank distribution of stick - slip events in sheared granular media @xcite , earthquakes @xcite , radionuclides half - life time and nuclides mass number @xcite .",
    "many complex systems share as well the same phenomenology , as happens in networks @xcite , biological clocks @xcite and metabolic networks @xcite .",
    "zipf discovered his rank law by analyzing manually the frequencies of 29,899 different words types in the novel ulysses  by james joyce , but when a larger set of words is considered , a deviation from a power law is observed for larger ranks lequan .",
    "a similar behavior is found in coding genetic sequences .",
    "deviations from the zipf law are also found in the tails ranking of many physical systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , is clear that one should expect a different behavior at the tails , since finite size effects should be present and the power law must be `` stopped '' at a certain region . in spite of this",
    ", many workers just ignore the tail effects by fitting the data in a restricted range , or they proceed in a very questionable way by fitting all the data with a power law .",
    "others have fitted sets of data in nature and in economy with stretched exponentials @xcite and log - normal distributions @xcite .",
    "the problem with the previous expressions is that they do not fit the data at _ both ending tails _ , where different kinds of processes are set in once a crossover region",
    "is reached .",
    "such crossovers are due to finite size effects , in which different mechanisms are set in when certain big and small scales are reached .",
    "this leads to the idea of using multiscaling physical modelling to understand such features .",
    "maybe the best example of the previous situation occurs in turbulence , where kolmogorov 's power law is observed only in the inertial regimen @xcitekolmogorov2 . in one tail ( small length scales )",
    "energy dissipation plays the main role , while energy injection dominates at big scales kolmogorov1@xcite . for each of these limits ,",
    "the scaling behavior is different @xcite@xcite .",
    "one can conjecture that similar ideas are behind many other complex physical systems , since we report that many rank laws are extremely well parametrized , outperforming many other rank - order models , with a two exponent beta function - like formula with parameters @xmath3,@xmath4where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fitted from the data , @xmath0 is the rank and @xmath7 is the maximal @xmath0 . if @xmath8 is normalized to @xmath1 , then @xmath9 @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , @xmath12 can be transformed into an integral that yields @xmath13 .",
    "we will show that @xmath8 is related with a kind of central limit theorem , in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 seem to be parameters related with the onset of different mechanisms .",
    "our work is in the same spirit of moyano _ et .",
    "moyano , who have commented that the rather ubiquitous presence of the tsallis @xmath14-distributions is maybe due to a @xmath14-generalized central limit theorem for a class of non independent , correlated , product of probability distributions @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following : in section ii we present some representative examples of the phenomenology that we have observed . in section iii",
    "we show how this phenomenology can be studied as a problem of hierarchies in the product of random variables , and then transformed into a related algebraic problem : what is the rank of a set of numbers produced by the iterative product of an initial finite set of numbers . in section iv , we solve the proposed problem , and finally , in section v we give the conclusions of this work .",
    "as starting point , we will provide some representative results of the wide phenomenology found in the tails of rank laws .",
    "we start with an example from geography .",
    "1 shows the population ranking of four representative municipalities in mexico and spain in a semilog plot .",
    "the corresponding fits using eq . ( [ beta ] ) are given by solid lines .",
    "the agreement is excellent , with a correlation coefficient @xmath7 bigger than @xmath15 for all fits .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for each fit are shown in the inset of the plot .",
    "we have verified that similar good results are obtained for the population of countries and states .",
    "figure 2 shows the impact factor against the rank of scientific journals , taken from a recent study @xcite , compared with the fits given by eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) .",
    "again , all the fits are excellent , with correlation coefficients above @xmath15 .",
    "similar excellent fitting results are obtained for codon usage in genomes , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , where we plot the logarithm of the frequency of codons ( normalized to @xmath16 ) as a function of the rank for different representative organisms , taken from a genome database @xcite . for all the organisms , the resulting correlation parameters are bigger than @xmath17 .",
    "now we turn our attention to physics . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the rank - ordered distribution of stick - slip events in a slowly sheared granular media taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , fitted using  eq . ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "although a modified power law was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the results , the present fit also gives a better correlation coefficient .",
    "here we presented four examples , but eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) can be used with excellent results in order to correct the gutenberg - ritcher law in earthquakes ranking , bnard convection cells and in many different fields , like arquitecture , music or roads @xcite .",
    "the previous section leads to the conclusion that both ending tails of the ranking present some degree of universality , and eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) seems to be an excellent fitting function due to the fact that it gives the right shape of the curve and thus very good correlation coefficients .",
    "also , it is simple and can be reduced to a pure power law by using an appropriate choice of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .  as the @xmath3 distributions is indeed ubiquitous",
    ", one can try to associate it to some generic mechanism , as happens in the central limit theorem or in the product of correlated probability distributions moyano .     in the dynamics of population , scientific journal impact factor ,",
    "codon usage and stick - slip events , there are many important issues that determine the behavior . in the case of the impact factor",
    "we can cite for example the ability to select a good problem for investigation , the gift for writing clear papers , etc .",
    "similar comments would be valid for the dynamics of granular media , as well as in economy , linguistics , genetics , etc .",
    "all of the previous systems share a common feature : their complex nature , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are build from many subsystems or path choices that produce a final result .",
    "one can try to model such complexity as follows . consider a system made from @xmath18 identical subsystems , where each can have @xmath19 different states or choices with probability @xmath20 , and @xmath21  when @xmath18 such subsystems are put together , the state space consists of all @xmath22possible sequences of length @xmath18 .",
    "if we do not care about the order of the choices or states in the string , there are just @xmath23 _ different combinations_. for example , if a system is made from @xmath24 subsystems , where each has two states or choices , say @xmath1 or @xmath25 , the possible global states are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , while there are only three combinations : @xmath26 , @xmath29 and @xmath27 , the last one has multiplicity @xmath2 .",
    "each combination has a certain probability that we call _ reduced probabilities _ @xmath30 .",
    "the multiplicity of  each different state is given by the multinomial coefficient @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of subsystems in the @xmath33-esim state .",
    "the probability of a global state of the whole system is,@xmath34with @xmath35 however , we are interested in the rank of the observed different values of the macrostates , not in their distribution of probability . to tackle this problem",
    ", we notice that each value @xmath30 corresponds to a",
    "_ different macrostate of the system_. in our example , the states @xmath28 and @xmath27 produce the same global macrostate .",
    "these two internal states lead to one global state that has the same characteristics .",
    "if one assume that a certain characteristic ( @xmath36 ) of a process or object is a function of @xmath37 , then each value of @xmath38 can be mapped to @xmath30 and @xmath39 . from the previous considerations , is clear that any rank hierarchy of @xmath40 will be inherited to @xmath38 .",
    "thus , many different rank features of a system are reduced to study the hierarchy present in @xmath41    for doing such study , there are two cases . in the first , the subsystems are independent , as in a bernoulli process , @xmath42and the other is the general case of interacting subsystems , in which the addition of a new subsystem leads to a functional relationship of the type,@xmath43 in the next section we will consider only the case of independent subsystems , in which no extra information is needed in order to model the correlation in the system .",
    "this allows to produce the beta - like function in a simple form .",
    "@xmath46for independent subsystems , an inspection of eq .",
    "( [ independent ] ) shows that the rank structure can be reduced to the following algebraic problem .",
    "take @xmath19 numbers @xmath47 @xmath48 at random ( normalization can be imposed at the end of the process ) , labeled in such a way that @xmath49 , and multiply once each number by all the numbers in the set . with these resulting numbers ,",
    "repeat the process @xmath18 times to obtain a set of numbers that have the form @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "if the resulting numbers are arranged in decreasing magnitude , we can assign a rank ( @xmath0 ) to each one according to its order in the hierarchy .",
    "the rank @xmath52 is assigned to @xmath53 , while the lowest rank @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath55 .",
    "for example , chose at random three numbers @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 and form all the possible products : @xmath59 . in fig .",
    "[ numbers ] , we present a plot of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . fig . [ numbers ] shows that the resulting ranks are well fitted by the same two parameter beta - like function , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath67 .",
    "the message from this numerical experiment is simple : if this product is seen as a multiplicative process where each number is the probability of making a certain choice or state in a process , then each possible result has a well determined hierarchy .",
    "the task that remains is how to calculate @xmath40 in terms of the rank .",
    "the problem is more easily solved using the logarithm of @xmath30,@xmath68each set of values @xmath69 is a point with integer coordinates in a @xmath70dimensional space . since @xmath71 ,",
    "all the points are in a subspace of dimension @xmath72 .",
    "the problem of the rank is reduced to find a path between the maximal rank point ( with coordinates @xmath73 ) to the minimum @xmath74 in such a way that @xmath75 decreases in each step . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the solution is easy to find . using that @xmath77 , @xmath78from where it follows that the range is given by @xmath79 .",
    "then,@xmath80with @xmath81 .",
    "( [ seq2 ] ) shows that the numbers decrease in an exponential way as a function of the rank .",
    "the case @xmath82 can be easily visualized in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] , where the points in the integer lattice defined by eq .",
    "( [ intlattice ] ) are shown as circles .",
    "a path between points of decreasing @xmath75 is indicated as a line that joins the lattice points in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] , for a given set of numbers @xmath83 and @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ sequence ] shows how the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 vary as a function of the range .",
    "a very complicated oscillatory pattern is seen , although a well defined envelope is also observed .",
    "this envelope is in fact the key to solve the problem , since it is the responsible of the ranking behavior .",
    "notice also that all paths always start at @xmath86 and finish at @xmath87 , since @xmath88    in general , since the index @xmath32 is a function of the rank @xmath0 ,  we can write that @xmath89 where @xmath0 is just the number of steps used to go from the point @xmath90 to a certain @xmath91 . it follows that,@xmath92the task is reduced to find the functions @xmath93 for a given set @xmath94 consider again the case of an initial set of three numbers , @xmath82 . using that @xmath95",
    ", @xmath96 can be written as ,    @xmath97    with @xmath98 and @xmath99 the solution for any set @xmath83 @xmath100 is complicated , because some paths are not periodic .",
    "however , one can work out first the cases @xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103 @xmath58 that give insights about how to treat others .",
    "let us first consider the limit @xmath101 @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding path is easy to find because it is similar to an odometer with an increased range after each turn , as seen in fig .",
    "[ triplane ] , due to the hierarchy @xmath106 .",
    "for example , when @xmath24 this leads to the following table that contains the number @xmath107 as a function of the rank , and the corresponding path given by @xmath108 and @xmath85 ,    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sequence of the path goes as follows , first @xmath109 is increased one by one as @xmath85 remains constant , until  it reaches a maximal value called @xmath110 which in fact determines the envelope of the ranking sequence and thus the basic shape of the curve @xmath107 ( the envelope that contains @xmath110 is shown in fig .",

    "then,@xmath114the corresponding value of @xmath115 can be obtained from the condition @xmath116 .",

    "[ limit2 ] , the agreement is also good , specially for low values of @xmath0 .",
    "now consider the general case in which @xmath126 and @xmath58 have the same order of magnitude , as in fig .",
    "[ numbers ] , where two tails appears , one for small @xmath0 and the other at @xmath0 near @xmath7 .",

    "the tail for @xmath0 near @xmath7 is produced by the lowest probability hierarchy , @xmath128 .",
    "these dominant factors are due to large statistical deviations and are the origin of the long tails in the otherwise power law observed in the ranks .",

    "a key observation for such study is that for expansion - modification algorithms in dna models , @xmath154 if the expansion probability of the genetic code is bigger the than mutation rate @xcite .",
