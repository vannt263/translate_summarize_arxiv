    "control and manipulation of coherent quantum systems is a major task for both nanotechnology @xcite and fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "specifically , quantum information processing ( qip ) operates with superposition states , which constitute the heart of quantum weirdness @xcite .",
    "since these states have an intrinsic nonlocal nature , their characterization becomes a nontrivial problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , the prediction and control of their time evolution are restricted by the unavoidable interactions with an environment that degrades the unitarity of quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "this process , called _ decoherence _ , involves the progressive and smooth destruction of the quantum interferences @xcite .    among the general expectations within the field quantum open systems @xcite ,",
    "is the claim that the more non - local and complex a superposition state is , the more fragile it becomes under the effects of decoherence .",
    "if indeed general , this might preclude scalability of qip implementations .",
    "the magnitude of such fragility seems to be intimately related to the number of correlated qubits and the way in which they evolve . in particular , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments with _ large _ arrays of interacting spins @xcite have shown that these can exhibit an intrinsically unstable dynamics .",
    "inspired by the nmr experiments , the loschmidt echo ( le ) @xcite arises as a natural way to quantify fragility .",
    "the le is defined in terms of the revival that occurs when a slightly imperfect time - reversal procedure is applied to a quantum evolution . such imperfection accounts for the presence of uncontrolled degrees of freedom , which play the role of an environment @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , it has been proved that even in the presence of simple perturbations , chaotic systems can become their own environment @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in such classically chaotic systems , dynamics leads to highly nonlocal superpositions that have already been related to the formation of sub - planck - scale structures associated with a boost of decoherence @xcite .",
    "the standard theoretical strategy to address decoherence and dissipation relies on defining a simple system @xmath0 that interacts with a large and complex environment @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "while the former has a few degrees of freedom , the latter typically has a dense spectrum , at least within the experimental time scales shorter than the heisenberg time , in which mesoscopic echoes would show up @xcite . within this framework",
    ", the spin - boson model ( sbm ) turns out to be one of the most employed paradigms @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a single two - level system ( tls ) @xmath0 interacting with a large reservoir @xmath1 of bosonic field modes , i.e. , a spin 1/2 coupled to an environment of harmonic oscillators ( ho ) .",
    "this model has also found wide application in the fields of chemical and biological physics , providing a rationale for the electron - transfer process .",
    "there , the role of the spin is played by a charge that can fluctuate between two reaction centers @xcite .    in this article , we switch the spin and boson roles as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using a ho as @xmath0 and a single tls as @xmath1 .",
    "this crucially different point of view seeks to assess how states with controllable complexity are degraded by a simple @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , only when this binary degree of freedom flips its state is the mixing among the states of @xmath0 enabled .",

    "the excellent agreement between them implies the accuracy of the lz physical picture .",
    "this is quite remarkable since the lz formula gives an asymptotic transition probability and relies on the linear approximation for the energies described above . as discussed in the literature @xcite , the exact dynamics through a nonlinear crossing might evidence transient oscillations that are not described by the lz formula .",

    "however , this effect is not observed in the well - defined first step of fig .",
    "[ fig le1 ] .",
    "thus , the linear lz provides a good description of this first transition .",
    "notice that , at a given size of the gap ( @xmath95 fixed ) , the transition probability is greater  when the speed at the crossing is higher .",
    "for @xmath100 we observe a strong decoherence , i.e. , almost half of the wave packet flips its spin projection . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath0 will rapidly reach a mixed state irrespective of the initial state being a cat or an incoherent superposition .",
    "this may hinder the relative _ fragility _ of these states .",
    "for such reason we consider a @xmath95 @xmath101 which is still the nonperturbative regime .    just before the third step a revival shows up .",
    "such revivals repeat in every following step , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig le1 ] .",
    "this can be understood by the semiclassical picture of fig .",
    "[ fig_model](b ) since the le peak appears exactly at the crossing time between the original wave packet and the one that escaped to the second parabola . in other words ,",
    "successive passages yield substantial interferences between the @xmath71 and @xmath102components of the evolved wave packet .",
    "such particular interferences yielding the revivals is in fact a manifestation of the well - known stckelberg phase commensuration @xcite , which appears in a tls when a periodic driving force leads to consecutive passages through an avoided crossing .",
    "it is also notable that the successive le steps become deeper as the phase coherence within each wave packet begins to decay . in this regime ,",
    "the single - passage formula [ eq_plz ] is no longer expected to be valid .",
    "however , under the rough assumption that every time the wave packet goes through the avoided crossing a  lz process occurs , i.e. , eq .",
    "[ eq_plz ] , one can compute a characteristic decay time @xmath103 in a markovian approximation .",
    "this would be given by the fraction of ho cycles needed to reach a specific decay ,    @xmath104    since for every cycle the wave packet goes two times through the gap .",
    "then ,    @xmath105=\\frac{2\\pi } { \\hbar } \\frac{\\left\\vert v_{\\uparrow \\downarrow } \\right\\vert ^{2}}{m\\omega _ { 0}^{2}q_{c}^{{}}\\dot{q}_{c}^{{}}}.\\ ] ]    since the period of oscillation is constant , @xmath106 :    @xmath107 \\label{eq_exponencial2 } \\\\ & = & \\left\\vert \\frac{v_{\\uparrow \\downarrow } } { \\hbar } \\right\\vert ^{2}2\\pi \\hbar n_{1}(e_{0})=\\left ( \\tau _ { \\uparrow \\downarrow } ^{{}}\\right ) ^{-2}\\tau _ { \\downarrow } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 is the energy of the initial state and @xmath108 is the gap energy , which is given by eq.[eq_cross ] .",
    "therefore , the decay rate diverges as the difference between @xmath78 and @xmath108 vanishes .",
    "additionally , initial states with high energies @xmath78 have lower decay .",
    "the last line describes the markovian decay rate in terms of the density of directly connected states @xmath109 and in terms of the characteristic time scales @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding exponential decay may be seen as a markovian approximation to the le degradation with respect to the spin - flip process . as shown in fig .",
    "fig le1 , the comparison with the actual le decay is only valid during the first cycle .",
    "repeated passages would give rise to memory effects which are not contained in a successive application of the single - passage lz formula .",
    "quite remarkably , we observe that the le turns out to be well fitted by a gaussian @xmath112 $ ] . within a considerably large energy range ,",
    "the observed gaussian time scale turns out to be about 1/3 of the markovian time , i.e. @xmath113 .    in the context of a spin system interacting with a spin bath , zurek and coworkers @xcite have argued that a gaussian decay of a le can be identified with a random walk in the energy space . in the fock - space representation of our system , it is clear that decoherence is a concatenated process : the spin flip controlled by @xmath114 followed by quantum diffusion along the energy coordinate [ vertical chain in fig .",
    "fig_model ( a ) ] . this last can be identified with such quantum random walk , with the survival probability given by @xmath115 . for short times",
    "this survival turns out to be a condition to maintain coherence between both spin states , and it is essentially a gaussian with a time scale @xmath116 .",
    "thus , it interesting to note that in spite of a numerical factor , the non - markovian gaussian decoherence rate is still described by eq.[eq_exponencial2 ] .",
    "this feature is also present in the gaussian to exponential interpolation formula proposed by flambaum and izrailev @xcite for short times , when memory effects are still effective .",
    "however , in spite of the mentioned plausibility arguments they are more appropriate to describe the decay of single - energy eigenstates , but they are not enough to provide a quantitative description of the degradation of the subtle collective interferences involved in the semiclassical wave - packet dynamics .",

    "we assign this effect to a particularity of the interaction used which , being energy dependent , produces an equivalent change in quantum phases of each wave packet of the superposition .",
    "thus , only the adiabatic tunneling would contribute to the decoherent process , and this has the same effect for the cat state and for the incoherent superposition .",
    "the difference between the two cases relies on the revivals associated with the stckelberg phase , which occurs when the wave packet components that remained with the same spin state interfere with the ones that changed it .",

    ", we focused on the fragility of the coherent superposition of wave packets ( cat states ) when compared with incoherent superpositions of the same wave packets .",
    "this required the evaluation of the dynamics of such states .",
    "a tool that made such calculations even more handleable was a wave - function treatment , which involves a chosen number @xmath150 of states in the hilbert space , instead of a full density matrix , which would involve dimensions of @xmath151 .",
    "the results indicate that coherent superpositions of semiclassical wave packets associated with different energies are more fragile than incoherent ones .",
    "the fragility increases with the energy difference , i.e. , nonlocality in the energy representation , between the individual wave packets . in our model",
    ", there is no evidence of fragility strictly related to spatial nonlocality .",
    "however , when nonlocality in space is associated with nonlocality in energy , the system becomes increasingly fragile towards the simple decoherence process .",
    "the exponentially increased fragility of cat states may be related to the problem of thermalization in closed quantum systems @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed to build a cat state with two macroscopic ( semiclassical ) wave functions with different energies for the purpose of analyzing the time average of any particular observable .",
    "in such a situation , in order to recover the standard ( classical ) microcanonical predictions for such observables , the interferences between the wave functions should be negligible .",
    "our results constitute a step towards this direction since we verified that the more separated in energy these wave packets are , the more easily they decorrelate , i.e. , the more fragile its phase coherence becomes .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from conicet , anpcyt , secyt - unc and mincyt - cor . this work benefited from discussions with a. d. dente and l. j. fernndez - alczar .",
    "d.b . kindly acknowledges m. castagnino for introducing her to the decoherence problem and his constant support during the first stages of this work .",
