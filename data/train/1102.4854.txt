    "a large number of bright galaxies that emit most of their radiation in the infrared ( 81000 @xmath0 m ; @xmath2 @xmath3 ) , peaking at @xmath460 @xmath0 m , were found with the _ iras _ infrared sky survey @xcite .",
    "these are called luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) or ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) if the infrared luminosity exceeds l@xmath5",
    "@xmath6 10@xmath7l@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the strong infrared emission means that powerful energy sources are present , hidden behind dust , which absorbs most of the primary energetic radiation ; the heated dust grains re - emit this energy as infrared thermal radiation",
    ". these energy sources can be starbursts ( energy release by nuclear fusion reactions inside stars ) , or activity within an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; energy conversion from gravitational energy generated by a mass - accreting supermassive black hole to radiative energy ) , or some combination of the two .",
    "once the primary energetic radiation is converted to heat , identifying the original energy source becomes an observational challenge .",
    "an effective method of investigating the energy sources of lirgs is to measure their emission surface brightnesses . in a starburst ,",
    "the radiative energy generation efficiency of nuclear fusion is only @xmath40.5% of mc@xmath9 , where m is the mass of material used in the nuclear fusion reaction , and c is the speed of light .",
    "the emission surface brightness of a starburst is modest and can not exceed a certain threshold ( @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 ) , as determined observationally @xcite and predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the radiative energy generation efficiency of an agn is much higher , at 642% of mc@xmath9 , where m is the mass of accreting material ( bardeen 1970 ; thorne 1974 ) . in an agn , high",
    "luminosity can be generated from a very compact area around a mass - accreting supermassive black hole , producing a very high emission surface brightness with @xmath610@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 .",
    "for the dusty lirg population , high spatial resolution imaging observations in the infrared are a suitable choice to constrain the emission surface brightnesses of energy sources , because dust absorbs most of the primary energetic radiation , infrared dust re - radiation dominates the observed spectral energy distribution , and so traces the intrinsic energetic radiation luminosities in lirgs . for a galaxy with given infrared luminosity , when the emission is spatially unresolved",
    ", a higher spatial resolution image can constrain the size of the emission region more strongly , and can provide a more stringent lower limit for the emission surface brightness of an energy source .",
    "ground - based 8-m class telescopes are better suited for this purpose than space - based infrared satellites with small apertures , as the former provides better spatial resolution than the latter . to investigate the spatial distribution of infrared emission of lirgs from the ground , @xmath12-band ( 813 @xmath0 m ) and @xmath1-band ( 1723 @xmath0 m ) earth atmospheric windows are possible choices .",
    "higher sensitivity can be achieved in the @xmath12-band than @xmath1-band , due to a smaller background level from earth s atmosphere .",
    "thus , @xmath12-band observations are more suitable for probing the overall morphology of infrared emission of lirgs , including both nuclear compact and diffuse extended components , to a fainter flux level @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of constraining the emission surface brightnesses of energy sources in lirg s nuclei , we believe that @xmath1-band observations are more powerful , for the following reasons",
    ". first , the long wavelengths of the @xmath1-band are significantly less affected by turbulence in the earth s atmosphere than shorter - wavelength bands .",
    "thus , in the @xmath1-band , diffraction - limited image sizes ( @xmath40@xmath135 ) are readily achievable using ground - based 8-m class telescopes under even modestly good weather conditions .",
    "hence , the point spread function ( psf ) at @xmath1 is stable over time , and the investigation of the intrinsic spatial extent of compact emission in lirgs is very reliable .",
    "second , in the @xmath12-band , ( 1 ) the contribution from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) emission features , originating in star - forming activity , can be strong , relative to dust continuum emission , and ( 2 ) infrared emission powered by an obscured energy source can be highly flux - attenuated by the strong 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption feature @xcite .",
    "suppose the case that @xmath490% of the total infrared ( 81000 @xmath0 m ) luminosity of a lirg is dominated by a compact , highly - obscured buried agn , with a small ( @xmath410% ) contribution from spatially - extended star - forming activity .",
    "while the @xmath12-band emission from the buried agn can be highly flux - attenuated , spatially - extended pah emission is unattenuated .",
    "if we observe such a lirg in the @xmath12-band , the fraction of the spatially - extended emission component , relative to the compact one , can be substantially higher than the actual energetic contribution to the total infrared luminosity , possibly misidentifying such a source as starburst - important .",
    "this possible ambiguity is largely overcome , if we observe the lirg in the @xmath1-band , because ( 1 ) the contribution from pah emission features is much reduced , compared to the @xmath12-band , and ( 2 ) the 18 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption feature is significantly weaker than the 9.7 @xmath0 m feature .",
    "we thus choose the @xmath1-band for our infrared imaging observations .    with the advent of high - sensitivity @xmath1-band imaging cameras attached to 8-m class telescopes at good astronomical observing sites , @xmath1-band high spatial resolution imaging observations of lirgs",
    "have now become technically feasible .",
    "we have therefore performed such observations , using the subaru 8.2-m telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii , and the gemini south 8.1-m telescope located at cerro pachon , chile . throughout this paper , h@xmath14 @xmath15 75 km s@xmath16",
    "mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 = 0.3 , and @xmath18 = 0.7 are adopted .",
    "due to the strong earth atmospheric background emission in the @xmath1-band ( 1723 @xmath0 m ) , sensitivity is still limited even with 8-m class telescopes .",
    "therefore , we chose nearby lirgs that are bright in the @xmath1-band as our main targets .",
    "as lirgs have highly concentrated nuclear gas and dust @xcite , many of the putative agns are likely to be obscured along virtually all directions at the inner regions and deeply _",
    "buried_. such buried agns lack the narrow line regions at the 101000 pc scale , photoionized by the agn radiation , and so optical spectroscopy fails to discover agn ( seyfert ) signatures .",
    "our primary scientific goal is to search for such optically elusive buried agns in optically non - seyfert lirgs , through the detection of high emission surface brightness energy sources . in fact , high spatial resolution @xmath1-band imaging , as a tool for quantitatively estimating the emission surface brightnesses of energy sources , is particularly effective at picking up buried agns with a dust covering factor of about unity , because almost all primary energetic radiation is converted to dust re - radiation , which can be probed with infrared observations .",
    "we selected lirgs with luminous buried agn signatures in x - ray , infrared , or millimeter spectra , as well as starburst - classified lirgs ( without buried agn signatures ) and optical seyfert 2s (= obscured by torus - shaped dusty medium ) of interest for comparison .",
    "a few very nearby well - studied galaxies with l@xmath5 @xmath19 10@xmath20l@xmath8 were also included in our sample , because their proximity allows us to investigate the infrared emission morphology in more detail on a _ physical _ scale .",
    "table 1 tabulates the 18 observed objects .",
    "the sample is heterogeneous .",
    "our scientific goals are ( 1 ) to strengthen any buried agn signatures suggested in previously obtained data , and ( 2 ) to determine if the emission surface brightnesses of energy sources in starburst - classified galaxies are indeed below the maximum limit sustained by a starburst phenomenon ( @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 ) , as widely argued .",
    "gemini @xmath1-band ( 1723 @xmath0 m ) imaging observations were made using t - recs ( thermal - region camera spectrograph ; telesco et al .",
    "1998 ) on the gemini south 8.1-m telescope , at cerro pachon , chile .",
    "t - recs uses a raytheon 320 @xmath21 240 pixel si : as ibc array , with a pixel scale of 0@xmath1309 .",
    "the field - of - view is 28@xmath138 @xmath2221@xmath136 .",
    "the detector was read out in correlated quadruple sampling ( cqs ) mode ( sako et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath23 filter ( 18.3 @xmath0 m ; 17.619.1 @xmath0 m ) was used to trace the @xmath418 @xmath0 m emission from lirgs . the standard chop - nod technique ( telescope nodding and secondary mirror chopping )",
    "was employed to subtract the background emission from earth s atmosphere and the telescope .",
    "object signals were taken at four different positions : ( nod , chop ) = ( 1 , a ) , ( 1 , b ) , ( 2 , a ) , and ( 2 , b ) . however , for t - recs data , only one chop position was guided , and compact , diffraction - limited - images were obtained . at another chop position ,",
    "the telescope was unguided , and stellar images were clearly degraded and spatially extended . only the data taken at the guided chop position were used for our analysis , to investigate the intrinsic spatial distribution of the infrared 18 @xmath0 m emission in a reliable manner .",
    "the chop and nod throw was 15  .",
    "for some sources with spatially extended structures , the position angle of t - recs was arranged to simultaneously cover the emission from these interesting regions .",
    "the frame rate was 25.8 ms , and total on - source exposure time was 1531 minutes .",
    "table 2 summarizes our detailed observing log .",
    "weather conditions were very good ( low background level ) in 2008 and 2009 , but during the 2010 observing runs , a high earth atmospheric background level allowed us to observe only bright sources .",
    "subaru @xmath1-band imaging observations were made using comics @xcite on the subaru 8.2-m telescope @xcite atop mauna kea , hawaii , under clear weather conditions .",
    "the details are shown in table 2 .",
    "the precipitable water vapor value was as low as @xmath191 mm during the 2008 observing run , and 34 mm during the 2009 run .",
    "the @xmath24 ( 17.7 @xmath0 m ; 17.2518.15 @xmath0 m ) filter was used to study the @xmath418 @xmath0 m emission from lirgs .",
    "comics employs a 320 @xmath21 240 si : as ibc detector for imaging observations .",
    "the pixel scale is 0@xmath1313 , providing a field of view of 42 ",
    "@xmath21 32  , if the full array is used .",
    "however , as the background emission was large for @xmath24-band imaging observations , we used a partial - readout mode , to avoid saturating the array .",
    "only 50120 rows were read out , depending on weather conditions , particularly on the precipitable water vapor value .",
    "the standard chop - nod technique was employed to subtract background emission .",
    "the frame rate was 1631 ms , depending on the actual background level at the time of observations , and the total on - source exposure time ranged from 16 to 60 minutes .",
    "our gemini t - recs data were reduced using the iraf - based analysis tool provided by the gemini observatory . after inspecting individual frames to confirm that no bad frames were included ,",
    "the task `` mireduce '' was used to combine frames to improve the signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "for some frames , a stripe - pattern noise was recognizable .",
    "we used the task `` miclean '' to correct for this noise pattern .",
    "the subaru comics data were analyzed using the iraf - based software package provided by the comics team .",
    "first , a flat - field image was created from frames with no object signals , and then individual frames were divided by the flat image .",
    "bad pixels and pixels hit by cosmic rays were identified , and signal values in these pixels were interpolated from the signals of the surrounding pixels .",
    "the frames were summed to improve the signal - to - noise ratios .    for both gemini south",
    "t - recs and subaru comics data , flux calibrations were made by comparing the signals of the targets with those of nearby bright standard stars compiled by cohen .",
    "the estimated flux levels of the target objects with sufficient signal at different nod / chop positions agreed to within @xmath190.1 mag .",
    "thus , the adopted choice for the absolute flux level of standard stars may represent the largest uncertainty when compared with other flux measurements reported in the literature .",
    "the observed nearby bright standard stars were also used to estimate the point spread function ( psf ) at the observed wavelengths , at the time close to the target observations , in a sky direction similar to the targets .",
    "the standard star images in the @xmath23-band ( 18.3 @xmath0 m ) taken with gemini south t - recs generally showed diffraction ring patterns around bright central peaks .",
    "those in the @xmath24-band taken with subaru comics often showed the so - called mitsubishi - pattern ( three diamonds around central bright cores ) .",
    "both of these observed features strongly suggest that nearly diffraction - limited image sizes were routinely achieved at @xmath418 @xmath0 m for both the gemini south and subaru telescopes .",
    "standard stars were observed before and after the targets .",
    "the fwhm values differed slightly between the two datasets .",
    "although the effects of seeing ( earth atmospheric turbulence ) at @xmath418 @xmath0 m are much smaller than at shorter wavelengths , all images can obviously suffer from a non - negligible amount of seeing - originated psf broadening .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that the smallest fwhm is the most representative of the intrinsic psf @xcite .",
    "as standard stars are bright , we can estimate the fwhm by dividing the combined final frame into individual frames .",
    "we adopted the smallest fwhm values found in some individual frames as the psf at @xmath418 @xmath0 m ( fwhm@xmath25 ) .",
    "the psfs of standard stars were estimated using the iraf task _ imexamine _ , _",
    "a_. following @xcite , the moffat function @xcite was basically adopted , but direct fwhm estimates were sometimes considered as a consistency check . in general , both values agreed for the data with sufficiently strong signals .    for gemini south t - recs data , @xcite measured the fwhm = 0@xmath1353 @xmath26 0@xmath13039 at the same @xmath23-band .",
    "our adopted fwhm values for the standard star ( fwhm@xmath25 ) ranged from 0@xmath13515 to 0@xmath13565 , consistent with the measurements by @xcite .",
    "the superantennae galaxy is at declination @xmath2772@xmath28 , and is very far south even for the gemini south telescope site , resulting in a larger air mass , even at the meridian , than other lirgs .",
    "the fwhm of hr 7383 , the standard star of superantennae , was actually slightly larger than the fwhms of other standard stars , possibly because of the telescope primary mirror misalignment caused by a larger air mass . for subaru comics data ,",
    "the adopted fwhm values for the standard star psfs fell in the 0@xmath13410@xmath1345 range .",
    "thus , it is important to use the fwhm of a standard star observed at an air mass similar to the air mass of each target .    as our target objects , lirgs , are generally fainter than bright standard stars , it was difficult to measure the fwhm values in individual frames in a reliable manner , due to the low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "thus , the fwhm values were reliably measurable only in the combined final frames . for the gemini south t - recs lirg data , one final dataset consisted of a @xmath415-min combined exposure , and one or two such datasets were taken . for moderately bright lirgs , we inspected individual frames in each dataset , but no obvious continuous image drift was detected . therefore , we measured the fwhm values in the final dataset . for objects with two such datasets ,",
    "a smaller fwhm value was adopted .    for subaru comics data of lirgs , one dataset consisted of 4-minute exposures , in which we could identify object signals and roughly measure the object peak positions .",
    "for some lirgs , the peak position continuously shifted along one direction at a maximum distance of a few pixels . since the air mass changed as observations proceeded ,",
    "this could be explained by the differences in refraction between the optical ( guiding camera ) and mid - infrared light ( comics camera ) due to the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we corrected for this shift manually at both the pixel scale ( using the iraf task _ imshift _ ) and the sub - pixel scale ( using the iraf task _ imshift _ and _ imalign _ ) .",
    "we then produced a final combined frame , and measured the fwhm values .",
    "the sub - pixel scale shift often provided larger fwhm values than the pixel scale shift , possibly because of the signal split into surrounding pixels during the sub - pixelization process .",
    "we adopted the smaller fwhm values as the @xmath418 @xmath0 m emission sizes of lirgs ( fwhm@xmath29 ) .",
    "the intrinsic 18 @xmath0 m emission sizes of lirgs ( fwhm@xmath30 ) were estimated using the formula fwhm@xmath30@xmath9",
    "= fwhm@xmath29@xmath9 @xmath27 fwhm@xmath25@xmath9 .",
    "while the fwhm values for the standard stars were derived from individual short exposure frames , those for lirgs were obtained from combined frames with longer exposure times .",
    "the fwhm values in the final combined frames are inevitably larger than the smallest fwhm values found in some individual short exposure frames , due to possible telescope tracking error ( drift ) and/or possible inclusion of poorer seeing data in some fraction of individual frames than the remaining majority of frames .",
    "thus , the fwhm@xmath30@xmath9 values for lirgs estimated in this way are conservative upper limits , or the estimated emission surface brightnesses (= flux divided by size ) of lirgs are conservative lower limits .",
    "however , our main conclusions are robust to this ambiguity because the presence of a luminous agn is considered only if the lower limit of the emission surface brightness of the energy source in the lirg substantially exceeds the maximum allowed value for a starburst phenomenon ( see @xmath315 ) .    finally , as mentioned by @xcite",
    ", spectral energy distributions differ between lirgs and standard stars , in such a way that standard stars are generally bluer than lirgs .",
    "hence , the effective wavelength in the observed filters can be slightly different ( i.e. , shorter for standard stars ) , possibly providing different psfs between lirgs and standard stars . however , the widths of the @xmath23 ( gemini south t - recs ) and @xmath24 ( subaru comics ) filters used are so narrow that this effect is practically negligible @xcite .",
    "even if it were non - negligible , this effect would result in a slightly larger psf for lirgs ( red ) than bluer standard stars , providing upper limits ( lower limits ) for the emission size ( emission surface brightnesses ) of lirgs .",
    "again , this ambiguity does not alter our conclusions ( see @xmath315 ) .",
    "when precipitable water vapor values were high ( @xmath63 mm ) during subaru comics observing runs , we performed @xmath12-band ( 813 @xmath0 m ) imaging observations of bright sources , mostly unobscured quasars ( qsos ) , as a backup program . the @xmath32 ( 8.49.2 @xmath0 m ) or @xmath33 ( 11.212.1 @xmath0 m )",
    "filters were used , because meaningful data could be obtained for bright sources in these filters ( compared to the @xmath24 filter ) even under high precipitable water conditions .",
    "it is interesting to measure the emission surface brightnesses of these qsos ( i.e. , known luminous unobscured agns ) , based on the @xmath410 @xmath0 m observations .",
    "table 3 shows our observing log .",
    "for the 2006 observing run , only 160 rows were read out .",
    "the standard chop - nod technique was employed to subtract the background emission .",
    "the exposure times were 41100 ms , and the total on - source exposure time ranged from 13 to 53 minutes .",
    "for the 2009 observing run of the lirg mrk 266 , observations were made only at the nod-1 position , using the full array , to simultaneously cover both the northern and southern nuclei with a separation of @xmath410  .",
    "the fwhms of standard stars and target objects were derived in the same way as outlined for the 18 @xmath0 m observations .",
    "the iraf task _ imexamine _ was used , and the moffat function was basically assumed . for bright standard stars , data were divided into individual frames , and the smallest fwhm value was adopted as the intrinsic psf because any unexpected factors ( tracking errors or sudden seeing degradation during parts of the exposure time ) work to increase the fwhm values . as the qsos were relatively bright , fwhm values were derivable in individual frames ( 100-s exposure ) . the smallest fwhm value was adopted .",
    "as the exposure time of individual frames was longer for qsos ( 100 s ) than standard stars ( 5 s ) , this procedure still provides conservative upper limits for the intrinsic spatial extent of @xmath410 @xmath0 m emission of qsos .",
    "the @xmath410 @xmath0 m emission of qsos was dominated by compact components .",
    "the lirg mrk 266 displayed a spatially extended emission , compared to the adopted psf .",
    "the presence of spatially extended , faint fuzzy emission , undetectable with our ground - based 18 @xmath0 m imaging observations , can be investigated by comparing our data with the spectra taken by _",

    "are derivable for lirgs that exhibit clear 18 @xmath0 m silicate dust absorption features .",
    "the corrected values are shown in table 6 .",
    "infrared observations can probe only emission absorbed by dust . for buried agns embedded in dust in virtually all directions , or starbursts",
    "whose individual stellar energy sources are surrounded by local dust with a covering factor close to unity , the intrinsic luminosities of primary energetic radiation can reasonably be estimated from the infrared 18 @xmath0 m observations . however , for agns with a dust covering factor significantly smaller than unity , a large amount of energetic radiation escapes without being absorbed by dust .",
    "such unabsorbed emission can not be probed through infrared observations .",
    "pg qsos are unobscured seyfert 1 agns , meaning that at least the direction along our line - of - sight is dust - free , in which case infrared observations can provide only lower limits for the intrinsic emission surface brightnesses of energy sources .",
    "following @xcite , we apply a factor of 5 correction for unobscured seyfert 1 agns .",
    "namely , the intrinsic emission surface brightnesses of the energy sources are 5 times larger than those estimated from infrared 10 @xmath0 m observations .",
    "these corrected values are also summarized in table 7 .",
    "lirgs usually show an infrared emission peak at @xmath460 @xmath0 m , and their total infrared luminosities are dominated by emission from big dust grains in thermal equilibrium with radiation @xcite . in the galactic diffuse inter - stellar medium ,",
    "emission from pahs and very small grains , which are transiently - heated and not in thermal equilibrium , contributes importantly to the infrared 18 @xmath0 m radiation @xcite .",
    "then , a question may arise whether our 18 @xmath0 m observations indeed probe the spatial distribution of dust in thermal equilibrium heated by the dominant energy sources in lirgs . we , however , believe that the 18 @xmath0 m observations are a good method to investigate the spatial distribution of 60 @xmath0 m emission in lirg s nuclei , for the following reasons .",
    "first , in the case of a normal starburst , it is very likely that pahs , very small grains , and big dust grains are spatially well mixed with stellar energy sources , and are heated and/or excited by the stellar radiation field .",
    "the spatial distribution of the emission from pahs , very small grains , and big dust grains at lirg s cores should not change dramatically on a few 100 pc scale .",
    "next , in the case of an agn , pahs are largely destroyed by strong x - rays , so that pah contribution to the observed infrared radiation becomes negligible @xcite . furthermore , high radiation density around an agn ( 1 ) heats big dust grains in thermal equilibrium to high temperature , and ( 2 ) destroys very small grains selectively , both of which make the contribution from big dust grains dominant to the infrared 18 @xmath0 m radiation .    finally , in a buried agn , the energy source (= a mass - accreting supermassive blackhole ) is more centrally - concentrated than the surrounding dust , so that dust temperature is higher at the inner part , closer to the central energy source , than the outer part . assuming approximately blackbody radiation , emission at a shorter infrared wavelength comes from more inside than that at a longer infrared wavelength ( figure 2 of imanishi et al .",
    "namely , the 18 @xmath0 m emission size is intrinsically smaller than the 60 @xmath0 m emission size , around a buried agn with centrally - concentrated energy source geometry . the same situation could occur , if an exceptionally centrally - concentrated , extreme starburst is considered ( figure 1e of imanishi et al .",
    "however , even for a luminous energy source with 10@xmath7l@xmath8 , the intrinsic size difference between the 18 @xmath0 m and 60 @xmath0 m emitting regions should appear on a physical scale much smaller than 100 pc , and should not be discernible in our spatial resolution of a few 100 pc physical scale for the majority of the observed lirgs .",
    "summarizing , the spatial extent of the 18 @xmath0 m emission is taken to be representative of that of the 60 @xmath0 m emission at lirg s cores on our physical resolution scale .",
    "the emission surface brightnesses estimated from our 18 @xmath0 m imaging observations can put important constraints on the nature of energy sources at lirg s cores .      in tables 6 and 7 , sources are categorized into three groups : ( 1 ) the lower limit for the emission surface brightness of the energy source is @xmath4610@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 , the maximum value achieved by a starburst phenomenon . ( 2 ) the actual value is substantially smaller than the starburst upper limit .",
    "( 3 ) the lower limit is smaller than the starburst upper limit .",
    "we discuss these results on an individual source basis , by comparison with other data reported in the literature .",
    "the following five sources at @xmath47 0.1 are diagnosed to be agn - important through infrared 2.535 @xmath0 m spectroscopy : ngc 1377 , iras 08572 + 3915 , iras 15250 + 3609 , superantennae , and iras 20551@xmath274250 ( table 1 , column 10 ) .",
    "the estimated emission surface brightnesses of the energy sources exceed @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 ( the maximum value of a starburst phenomenon ) by a factor of @xmath63 for iras 08572 + 3915 and 15250 + 3609 ( table 6 ) , supporting the presence of luminous buried agns in these sources .",
    "for superantennae , iras 20551@xmath274250 , and ngc 1377 , the lower limits of the emission surface brightnesses only barely exceed @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 .",
    "as superantennae is classified optically as a seyfert 2 ( table 1 ) , the dust covering factor around that agn could be smaller than the other buried agn candidates ( iras 20551@xmath274250 and ngc 1377 ) , so that the intrinsic emission surface brightness could be higher than our estimate in table 6 .",
    "in these three sources , although the presence of a luminous agn is a possibility , the identity of the energy sources is not strongly constrained from our 18 @xmath0 m imaging observations .",
    "the five ulirgs , iras 00091@xmath270736 , 00188@xmath270856 , 01004@xmath272237 , 01298@xmath270744 , and 04103@xmath272838 are also classified into buried - agn - important galaxies through infrared 2.535 @xmath0 m spectroscopy , but their redshifts are larger than @xmath48 0.1 ( table 1 )",
    ". the lower limits of the emission surface brightnesses are below or only barely larger than @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 , so that the constraints on the energy sources based on our infrared imaging methods are weak .",
    "observational constraints on the size of emission regions are practically limited by the _ apparent _ spatial extent of the infrared emission , which corresponds to a larger _ physical scale _ for more distant sources .",
    "higher spatial resolution imaging observations at 18 @xmath0 m , using a proposed 30-m class extremely large telescope @xcite will be required to better constrain the energy sources of ulirgs at @xmath48 0.1 .      in table 7 , the emission surface brightnesses of five pg qsos (= unobscured seyfert 1 agns ) are estimated from 10 @xmath0 m imaging data , and their lower limits are close to or barely exceed @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 .",
    "although these results are consistent with the agn - dominated picture of these pg qsos , further quantitative discussions are difficult because of ( 1 ) the uncertainty of the dust covering factor correction , and ( 2 ) the possibly lower psf stability of the 10 @xmath0 m imaging data compared to our 18 @xmath0 m results ( @xmath311 ) .      in four lirgs , ngc 2623 , ngc 7592 w , vv 114 e , and mrk 266 n , the presence of an obscured agn is suggested , but starburst activity is also strong ( table 1 , column 10 ) . the estimated lower limits for the emission surface brightnesses are far below @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 , and so our data do not provide evidence for energetically important agns .",
    "ngc 4945 also belongs to this class . due to its proximity ( distance @xmath4 4.0 mpc ) ,",
    "the nuclear region is spatially resolved at small physical scales ( 1  corresponds to @xmath420 pc ) .",
    "the bright region , denoted `` a '' in figure 1 , is observed as an elongated peak in the infrared @xmath49-band ( 3.5 @xmath0 m ) and @xmath12-band ( 10 @xmath0 m ) @xcite , but at 18 @xmath0 m , it is barely resolved into two distinct peaks with a separation of @xmath40@xmath135 , possibly because of reduced dust extinction at 18 @xmath0 m .",
    "the left ( ne ) peak is even brighter ; this might be the location of the putative buried agn suggested from x - ray observations at @xmath610 kev @xcite .",
    "two fainter distinct emission components are seen at the sw of nucleus a. a similar pattern is seen in the high spatial resolution infrared @xmath50-band ( 2.2 @xmath0 m ) image @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to starburst knots .",
    "three lirgs , ngc 1614 , arp 193 , and eso 602@xmath27g025 , have no obvious luminous agn signatures in any observational data obtained to date , and are consistent with a starburst - dominant picture .",
    "these lirgs were observed as a control sample to determine whether these starburst - classified galaxies show spatially extended structures and emission surface brightnesses within the starburst range .",
    "as expected , spatially extended emission structures and low emission surface brightnesses are confirmed .",
    "thus , for these lirgs , our 18 @xmath0 m imaging data support a starburst - dominant nature .",
    "ngc 5253 is a very nearby galaxy ( distance @xmath4 3.9 mpc ) , dominated by a nuclear super star cluster @xcite .",

    "@xcite argued that the emission surface brightness of a starburst phenomenon can exceed @xmath410@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 , if the average dust temperature is t @xmath6 200k .",
    "theoretically , the maximum surface brightness of a starburst phenomenon is determined by the balance of stellar radiation pressure to dust and gravitational boundaries @xcite . under high stellar radiation density , dust and gas (",
    "collisionally coupled with dust ) are expelled away , and further star formation activity is suppressed @xcite . at a high average dust temperature ,",
    "t @xmath6 200k , some fraction of small , fragile dust can be sublimated , decreasing the total dust opacity to stellar radiation , and possibly increasing the maximum allowed emission surface brightness of a starburst .",
    "if this were the case in many lirgs , the constraint of emission surface brightnesses of @xmath3610@xmath10l@xmath8 kpc@xmath11 would not serve as a strong agn signature .",

    "the observed infrared spectral energy distribution in lirgs is that the t @xmath6 200 k starbursts are occurring only in the centrally concentrated regions of lirg s nuclei , and are surrounded by large amounts of nuclear dust ( similar to buried agn geometry ; figure 1e of imanishi et al .",
    "2007a ) . in this geometry ,",
    "the original t @xmath6 200 k starburst emission is once absorbed by the surrounding nuclear dust , and the re - emitted infrared dust emission indicates cooler temperatures , as observed in actual lirgs .",

    "thus , it seems reasonable for star formation to occur in the large volumes of lirg s nuclear regions occupied by high - density gas , and it is not clear why stars are formed only in the centrally concentrated regions of lirg s nuclei .",

    "<S> we find that the infrared 18 @xmath0 m emission from the buried agn candidates is generally compact , and the estimated emission surface brightnesses are high , sometimes exceeding the maximum value observed in and theoretically predicted for a starburst phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the starburst - classified lirgs usually display spatially extended 18 @xmath0 m emission and the estimated emission surface brightnesses are modest , within the range sustained by a starburst phenomenon . </S>",
