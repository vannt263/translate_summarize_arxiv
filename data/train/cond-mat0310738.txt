    "the term of `` glassy - dynamics '' is now commonly used to describe out - of - equilibrium systems that display such generic features as very slow kinetics that prevent the system from reaching equilibrium in any reasonable experimental timescale , aging phenomena , history - dependent processes like hysteresis and memory effects . among such systems",
    "are the `` not - too - strongly '' vibrated granular materials@xcite . in the recent years , there has been a surge of research activity in this field@xcite , partly driven by the goal of providing a statistical - mechanical description of these out - of - equilibrium situations@xcite@xcite .    in this note",
    ", we consider an approximate statistical - mechanical description of the parking - lot - model ( plm ) for vibrated granular materials@xcite that is based on the formalism proposed by edwards and coworkers@xcite . despite its simplicity",
    ", the one - dimensional model of random adsorption - desorption of hard particles ( plm ) has the merit of being a microscopic , off - lattice model that mimics many features of the compaction of a vibrated column of grains",
    ". it also has , we hope , a didactic value as to the nature of several canonical characteristics of `` glassy dynamics '' .",
    "many of the properties of the model , that can be obtained either analytically or by computer simulation , have been already described in the literature@xcite .",
    "our main focus here is on memory effects , including the so - called kovacs effect first observed in glassy polymers@xcite(see also@xcite ) , and on the ingredients that are needed in a statistical - mechanical description to account for such effects .",
    "the parking - lot model is one - dimensional process in which hard rods of length @xmath1 are deposited at random positions on a line at rate @xmath2 and are inserted successfully only if they do not overlap with previously adsorbed particles ; otherwise they are rejected .",
    "moreover , all deposited particles can desorb , i.e. , be removed from the line at random with a rate @xmath3 . for convenience , the unit time is set to @xmath4 , and the unit length to @xmath1 . with this choice of units , the only control parameter in the model is @xmath5 .",
    "when desorption is forbidden ( @xmath6 ) , the model corresponds to the purely irreversible one - dimensional random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) process@xcite , also known as the car parking problem , and all the properties of the system as a function of time can be obtained exactly .",
    "connection to the compaction of a vibrated column of grains is made by considering the line as average layer ( a @xmath7-dimensional model would be more realistic , but the qualitative behavior would not be altered ) , the time as the number of taps , and @xmath8 as the tapping strength that controls the fraction of particles ejected from the layer at each tap .    when @xmath8 is not strictly equal to zero , adsorption and desorption are competing mechanisms that drive the system to a steady state corresponding to an equilibrium fluid of hard rods at a constant activity @xmath8 .",
    "all the properties of the steady - state can also be obtained exactly .",
    "the compaction kinetics of the parking - lot model at constant @xmath9 is described by @xmath10 where @xmath11 the density of hard rods on the line at time @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the fraction of the line that is available at time @xmath12 for inserting a new particle , i.e. , the probability associated with finding an interval free of particles ( a `` gap '' ) of length at least @xmath14 .",
    "the quantities @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be obtained from the @xmath17gap distribution function @xmath18 which is the density of gaps of length @xmath19 at time @xmath12 via a number of `` sum rules '' : @xmath20 the @xmath17gap distribution function @xmath18 obeys a kinetic equation that also involves @xmath0gap distribution function .",
    "similarly , the kinetic equation of the @xmath7-gap distribution involves the @xmath21gap distribution function , and so on@xcite .",
    "the resulting infinite hierarchy of coupled equations can not in general be solved analytically ( exceptions are the rsa , when @xmath6 and equilibrium when @xmath22 ) .",
    "the description of the kinetics of the parking lot model at large , constant @xmath9 ( i.e. small , constant tapping strength ) can be summarized as follows : the density increases monotonically during the process , and the kinetics can be considered as a succession of four different regimes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) : during a first stage , the density increases rapidly until a value of around @xmath23 , and it is followed by an algebraic approach toward the saturation density , @xmath24 of the model without desorption ( rsa ) ; around this density there is a crossover to a still slower @xmath25 compaction regime that is reminiscent of what is exactly observed when @xmath26 , and finally there is an exponential approach to the steady - state ( equilibrium ) density with a rate @xmath27 .",
    "for the two first regimes , desorption has a negligible effect and only the two last regimes are relevant for the compaction kinetics of vibrated granular materials ( although the approach to equilibrium may be prohibited when @xmath9 is very large ) .",
    "experimentally , it has been observed that granular compaction exhibits history - dependent phenomena .",
    "in particular , josserand _ et . al_@xcite",
    "have shown that memory effects are seen when changing the tapping strength during the compaction kinetics .",
    "similar effects have been found in the parking - lot model , when the tapping strength @xmath8 is switched at a given time to a larger ( or smaller ) value : see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ]    the obvious lesson that one can draw such memory effects is that whereas equilibrium is fully described by one thermodynamic parameter , the density @xmath15 , out - of - equilibrium situations require at least one additional `` thermodynamic '' parameter",
    ". this parameter can not simply be the tapping strength since the system can be found in states characterized by the same tapping strength @xmath8 and the same density @xmath15 , that nonetheless evolve in different ways under further tapping with the same strength @xmath8 : this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b . a natural candidate for an additional thermodynamic parameter",
    "is the available line fraction @xmath16 .",
    "one can indeed check that the two states described above do correspond to distinct values of @xmath16 .",
    "following the ideas put forward by edwards and coworkers@xcite , we consider a statistical - mechanical description of the system in which all possible microstates characterized by a ( small ) number of fixed macroscopic quantities are assumed to be equiprobable ( `` flat '' or microcanonical distribution ) .",
    "in addition to fixing the density @xmath15 , the parameter originally selected in the compactivity - based description of granular media by edwards and coworkers , we also constrain the microcanonical ensemble by fixing the available line fraction @xmath16 to account for the above discussion .    denoting by @xmath28 the total length available for insertion of a particle center ( @xmath29 ) , the configurational integral with the constraints of fixed @xmath28 , fixed system size @xmath30 , and fixed number of particles @xmath31",
    "is obtained as@xcite    @xmath32    which can be rewritten as @xmath33\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote two closed contours . in the macroscopic limit , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 fixed , one can use a saddle - point method to evaluate the integrals , which leads to @xmath39 where the entropy density @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 solutions of the two coupled equations @xmath44    the gap distribution functions can also derived along the same lines@xcite , which leads to @xmath45 it can also be shown that the multi - gap distribution functions satisfy a factorization property , e.g. , @xmath46 .",
    "note that the @xmath14-gap distribution function is a piecewise continuous function that obeys the exact sum rules , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and  ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "a detailed comparison between the predictions of this statistical - mechanical treatment and simulation data _ at the same @xmath15 and @xmath47 _ can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that although not exact , and even missing some qualitative features in the limiting case of a purely irreversible rsa process , the approach provides an overall good description of the data .",
    "( it becomes of course exact in the steady state since this latter corresponds to an equilibrium situation . )",
    "a quasi - thermodynamic approach is useful because it allows to predict the structure of the system ( correlation functions ) as well as the fluctuations at any given state point ( here assumed to characterized by @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) . in the cases where phase transitions occur",
    ", it can also provide interesting constraints and relations between the parameters characterizing the phases at the transition or help to determine the limit of stability of the phases in mean - field like treatments .",
    "however , one still faces the problem of predicting the state of the system _ for a given protocol and a given history _ : in the simplest case , for a given time @xmath12 and a given tapping strength @xmath8 .",
    "we thus want to push the edwards formalism one step further . predicting the trajectory made by the system in the @xmath48 diagram for a given protocol amounts to determine a system of equations relating @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath12 and @xmath9 .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is one such equation . to obtain another equation for the evolution of @xmath16 , we start for the exact kinetic equation for the @xmath17gap distribution function for @xmath49 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath7-gap distribution function that satisfies the `` sum rule '' @xmath52 note that the approximate @xmath0gap distribution function @xmath53 satisfies the above sum rule . by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) by @xmath54 , integrating over @xmath19 from @xmath14 to @xmath55 , and using the sum rules , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) , one obtains an exact equation for the evolution of @xmath16 : @xmath56 if one now inserts the approximate expression of the @xmath14-gap distribution function , eq .  ( [ eq:7 ] ) , in the above equation , one gets @xmath57    eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:5 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) form a closed set of equations whose solution for given initial conditions completely characterizes the system and its evolution .",
    "we first test the accuracy of the above approximate kinetic description in two limiting cases for which the exact solution is known : the purely irreversible rsa case ( @xmath58 ) and the approach to the steady state ( @xmath22 ) for a given rate @xmath9 .",
    "the steady state corresponds to the solution @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the equilibrium density of hard rods at constant activity @xmath8 : @xmath62 with @xmath63 ; it is thus the exact result .",
    "the approach to the steady state is obtained by linearizing the kinetic equations around the equilibrium solution .",
    "one then obtains the following coupled linear differential equations : @xmath64    the associated eigenvalues are all negative and that corresponding to the inverse of relaxation time goes for large @xmath9 as @xmath65 the relaxation time is of the same order of magnitude as that obtained in the simple adiabatic approximation@xcite and is much smaller than the exact result ( see above ) .",
    "the error comes from the inability of the edwards approximation to account for the non - exponential behavior of the @xmath17gap distribution function for @xmath66 .",
    "one the other hand the approximate kinetic description is very good in the purely irreversible case , @xmath58 , ( but it still misses some features , as discussed above and in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "then eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) simplify to    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are related to @xmath15 and @xmath16 by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that at long times @xmath70 goes to a finite limit whereas @xmath71 goes to @xmath72 as @xmath12 . as a result",
    "the kinetics approaches a non - trivial jamming limit with an algebraic @xmath73 behavior .",
    "the numerical solution of the approximate equation shows that the saturation density at the jamming limit @xmath74 is very close to the exact value , @xmath75 .",
    "the overall agreement with the exact density evolution is very good , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "finally , we apply the approximate kinetic equations to the description of memory effects . by introducing @xmath16 as the second state variable , one expects to obtain a response to a sudden change of the tapping strength that captures these memory effects .",
    "this is indeed illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a that shows how the density evolves when @xmath9 is changed at @xmath76 from @xmath77 to @xmath78 and from @xmath77 to @xmath79 . at longer times , note that the density curve corresponding to the change from @xmath77 to @xmath79 crosses two times the density curve calculated when @xmath79 is kept constant along the process .",
    "this is the signature of a kovacs - like effect which is more clearly displayed in the parametric plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:4]b : instead of going monotonically to the final value , the density decreases first and passes by a minimum after increasing again .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior of the density ( or the volume ) is precisely the kovacs effect .",
    "the same phenomenon is illustrated for different values of the tapping strength in figs  [ fig:5]a and b : @xmath9 is switched from @xmath80 to @xmath81 or from @xmath80 to @xmath82 after a time @xmath83 . in the former case ,",
    "the density reached at @xmath83 when @xmath9 is changed is higher than the final ( equilibrium ) density reached at @xmath77 ; nonetheless , the density starts by first decreasing to a value less than the final density until it reaches a minimum and finally increases again . on the other hand ,",
    "no minimum is observed in the latter case .",
    "the kovacs effect is traditionally represented as a `` hump '' in the volume as a function of time@xcite .",
    "the position and the height of the hump vary with the waiting time , i.e. , the time spent at the initial tapping strength ( recall that the process of compaction is always out of equilibrium ) , and with the amplitude of the shift in the tapping strength ( or in other glassy systems , the shift in temperature ) .",
    "the same behavior is found here .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] where we show the evolution of the inverse density for different protocols to reach the equilibrium steady state at @xmath77 : in the upper curve , @xmath9 is switched from @xmath80 to @xmath81 at @xmath84 , in the intermediate curve @xmath9 is switched from @xmath82 to @xmath81 at @xmath85 and in the lower curve @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "the waiting time @xmath88 is chosen that the density reached at that time is equal to final density , @xmath89 .",
    "one observes that the height of the hump increases as the amplitude of the shift increases .",
    "the kovacs effect , also observed in the simulation data ( not shown here ) , results from competing trends that are qualitatively well accounted for by the present description in terms of two thermodynamic parameters . including @xmath16 in the statistical - mechanical treatment is crucial for reproducing such behavior .",
    "we have applied a two - parameter statistical - mechanical formalism inspired by the work of edwards and coworkers to describe the compaction kinetics of the parking - lot model .",
    "the approximation gives a fair description of the kinetics , although it underestimates the relaxation time characteristic of the final approach to equilibrium .",
    "inclusion of a second thermodynamic parameter allows one to qualitatively reproduce experimentally observed memory effects in granular compaction and to predict a kovacs effect similar to what is observed in many glassy systems .",
