    "the study of how we vote and several aspects of its dynamics has been of interest in the last years  @xcite , increased by the large amount of data currently available on the internet . in this context",
    ", tools of statistical mechanics , complex systems and other fields of physics and mathematics have been used to understand the voting process@xcite . in an increasing number of cases",
    ", the advent of new technologies is changing the way in which elections are realized , not only the way that information appears in the mass media , but also the emergence of real - time data .",
    "public access to partial results at the same time that votes are counted could be the rule in the future .",
    "in many processes the results are clear ; however , in closed elections , some counterintuitive results appear . understanding this behavior is important , since our experience with _",
    "uncorrelated _ situations give us an insight that could be wrong when we deal with _ correlated _ variables .",
    "the faithfulness of the data is an important issue , since the record of social processes is subject to all kinds of uncontrollable factors .",
    "furthermore , while data considered for analysis in physics are subject to a careful understanding of the sources of error , such analyses are almost absent in studies of voting process .",
    "in this work , we present an approach to both these problems : we analyze the real time results obtained during the federal election in mexico in the year of 2006 , and we offer an analysis of the distribution of errors obtainable from this public database .",
    "we focus our study on the data obtained from the `` program of preliminary electoral results '' , or prep , after its acronym in spanish  @xcite , which is the system implemented by the electoral authorities ( instituto federal electoral , ife ) . in mexico",
    ", the election is performed using electoral cabins ( pollng stations ) that admit , by construction , @xmath0 voters and that are , approximately , uniformly distributed over the whole population with the right to emit a vote .",
    "the prep works with certificates that are stamped on the packets of ballots ( named electoral packets ) . in those certificates the citizen authorities of each electoral cabin",
    "write the number of votes received for each party , total number of those votes , etc .",
    ", at the end of the electoral day . later , the authorities of each electoral cabin deliver the electoral packets and their certificates to the capture centers .",
    "the time of arrival is captured and the results stamped on the electoral packets .",
    "the records are sent to mexico city headquarters and published on the electoral authorities website  @xcite .",
    "the final results are recorded in a public file  @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on such a file .",
    "we label the political parties as p1 , p2,@xmath1 , p5 , as they appear in the database ; the keys appear in reference  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we show the time behavior of the record that prep yields and we analyze the reliability of the system . using some simple conservation laws ( self - consistency ) , in section  [ section : conservationlaw ] , we make the error analysis of data which appear in the prep file . in section  [ section : distributions ]",
    "we show and analyze the distributions of votes for deputies , senators and president . a brief conclusion about the error of the election using the results of the prep follows .",
    "around 20:00 hrs on july 2nd , 2006 , the _ program of preliminary electoral results _ ( prep ) of ife  @xcite began to publish on its website the vote percentages for the presidential election performed that day .",
    "the update was each @xmath2 minutes and the news services reproduced it .",
    "a very close election , according to opinion polls , was expected between the two main candidates of p1 and p3 parties .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the key of the party names ) .",
    "at the beginning , the tendency showed a decrease in the number of votes for the p1 s candidate and an increase for the candidate of the party p3 . at first sight",
    ", a crossing seemed to be imminent between the percentage of votes obtained by the two candidates .",
    "for this reason , several scientists as well as laymen started the capture of real - time data using different methods , some captured by hand , others captured automatically with programs like _ perl _ @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : realtime ] we show the plot of the real - time data given by the prep for the three main candidates of p1-p3 parties .",
    "this plot shows roughly two tendencies for the vote percentage obtained by the candidate of p3 party .",
    "the increasing tendency changed to a decreasing one around 3:00 am ( @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : realtime ] ) of july 3rd .",
    "as can be seen in the same figure , the p2 candidate increased its vote percentage changing the tendencies of the candidates of p1 and p3 , respectively .    as a result",
    ", no crossing between the vote percentage of the two main candidates was found with the prep in real time .",
    "a common belief is to consider that the behavior of a graph like figure  [ fig : realtime ] reaches its final value in a direct way , and a change like the presented here looks suspicious .",
    "however , one should be careful , since we can not consider an a priori uncorrelated behavior .",
    "the graph shows vote percentage and , evidently , this fact introduces correlations between the variables .",
    "additionally , the temporal data are not taken from a _ uniform _ sample and so we do not expect a fast convergence to the final results . assuming a clean election , the first data that arrived to the capture centers were from sites with better transport networks and/or a better vote counting performance . in ref .",
    "@xcite , correlation with an official marginalization index is presented and confirm this assertion : reports from polling stations inside regions of low marginalization index arrived early to capture centers .",
    "here , we present examples of how the sampling of polling stations rules the shape of percentage vote graph . evidently , the final values are the same .",
    "a calculation of the correlation coefficient shows the obvious relation between the percentages ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) , except in the case of the presidential candidate of p4 which autocorrelation is @xmath4 .",
    "other anomalies appear with this party and are reported below .",
    "note that not all the autocorrelations in table [ tab:1 ] are one , since the percentage is calculated on the variables shown .",
    "a large variablility in the prep records exists and is reported in section [ section : conservationlaw ] .",
    "however , the autocorrelations of votes received is one in all the cases .",
    "a test on the statistical significance of the correlation coefficients can be done using a resampling method  @xcite .",
    "however we found much more instructive to show the behavior of the percentages under resampling .",
    ".correlation matrix of vote percentage .",
    "i.c . stands for independent candidates and an . for annulled votes . [",
    "cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]         we first checked that the final version of prep file final version reproduces the behavior shown in figure  [ fig : realtime ] .",
    "secondly , we plot the prep data sampled in different ways . in fig .",
    "[ fig : votationbystate ] appears the percentage of votes sampling as is ordered in their final form , by alphabetical order of the state name and not by arrival time , for the same cases as in the previous figure .",
    "as can be seen , the tendency of each state of mexico is reflected in this plot . a clear correlation between the percentage of votes and the way we sort the vote certificates is observed . in order to breake down such a correlation ,",
    "we sort the certificates in a random way and recalculate the percentages , i.e. considering a uniform random sample from the polling station records .",
    "this procedure yields a fast convergence to the final values , except for small fluctuations , as expected . in fig .",
    "[ fig : votesorted](a ) and ( b ) we show two realizations of such a shuffled process , one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : votesorted](a ) ) with the p1 candidate winning at the beginning and another ( fig .  [ fig : votesorted](b ) ) with an initial advantage for the p3 party . hence , we have two different samples of the polling stations taken uniformly that present the expected convergence but with different beginnings .    since there is no unique way to order the sample ( as explained before , that depends on several factors ) , it is possible to sort the data in a way that any of the three main candidates has an initial advantage for a small number of processed votes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : votesorted](c ) , we select all the certificates where the p2 candidate won and put them at the beginning of the sample .",
    "clearly , this candidate retains his advantage for around 11% of processed votes and loses it after that . in fig .",
    "[ fig : votesorted](d ) we show the result of considering at the end of the counting process ( for a random shuffle ) all the cabins where the candidate of p3 party won ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "note that until this event happens the canditate remains in third place all the time .",
    "in other words , if this candidate do not win in the polling station he is the _ third _ option , with a percentage of votes even smaller than p2 .",
    "the percentage of votes as a function of the number of records for the small parties is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : percentagepartidoschicos ] . as can be seen , the number of annulled votes is more than twice the final difference between the two main candidates .",
    "another interesting observation from this figure is that the number of votes for the non - registered candidates is very large .",
    "this means that one of the independent candidates could obtain one or more places in the chamber since , under the mexican law , there are some positions , in both chambers , proportional to the total number of votes obtained by each party . the same is true for the case of annulled votes , which represent @xmath6 of the votes counted . from figs .",
    "[ fig : votationbystate ] and  [ fig : percentagepartidoschicos ] one can see , directly , that there are strong correlations between the parties that obtained large and small percentage of votes .",
    "the percentage of votes for senators and deputies shows a similar behavior to that of the presidential candidates , with the sole exception of the p4 party , which shows a number of votes approximately four times larger for the chamber positions than those for president .    .",
    "to @xmath7 . we assume that these peaks are related with typos .",
    "we note that the distributions for senators show a strange behavior compared with the corresponding distributions for president and deputies in its left branch . ]    in the cabin certificates several data are recorded : total number of received ballots at the beginning of the electoral process ( br ) , number of remaining ( not used ) ballots ( bs ) , number of voters ( v ) , number of deposited ballots per cabin ( bd ) and the number of votes received for each party / candidate ( v@xmath8 , @xmath9 p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , p5 , non - registered candidates and annulled votes ) . based on this information",
    ", there are some conservation laws that can be checked , for self - consistency , in this election .",
    "the quantities considered are those that were calculated and registered independently by the electoral authorities when the votes were counted . in this sense",
    ", they are non - trivial . for instance",
    ", one can check the loss or appearance of ballots .",
    "in particular , we study the total number of ballots , br , against the sum of the number of remaining ballots , bs , and the number of voters per cabin , v , i.e. , br-(bs+v ) . in principle",
    ", this number should be zero , but , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lostballots ] , the distribution of this quantity is peaked around zero but is neither the expected dirac delta function @xmath10 , nor a gaussian or a lorentzian .",
    "data on the positive axis mean lost ballots . data on the negative axis indicate appearance of ballots .",
    "zooms in different parts of this distribution show the following facts : ( 1 ) the prep preserve this number for only @xmath11 of the cabins .",
    "this result is unfortunate for the electoral authorities ( ife ) since it says that prep reliability is less than @xmath12 .",
    "( 2 ) the distribution is not completely symmetric .",
    "in particular the peak around @xmath13 is higher than the peak at @xmath14 .",
    "( 3 ) there are inconsistencies larger than @xmath0 votes for several cabins .",
    "( 4 ) there are peaks at @xmath15 and also at @xmath16 . these peaks , we assume , are related with capture typos .",
    "( 5 ) the peak at the left side of the distribution shows a different behavior for senators than the other cases .",
    "this result can not be statistically understood , since all certificates ( for president , senators and deputies ) are captured in the same way . _",
    "a result like this means that the capture of the data was different for three similar processes . _ ( 6 ) the distribution between @xmath17 and @xmath7 decays as a power law as can be seen in the insert of figures  [ fig : lostballots ] to [ fig : lostvotes ] .        in figs .",
    "[ fig : lostdeposited ] and  [ fig : lostvotes ] we test other conservation laws , by plotting the distributions of differences between the total ballots received br and the sum of the ballots remaining bs plus the ballots deposited in urns bd per cabin , i.e. , br-(bs+bd ) , for the first figure . in the second figure we plot the difference between the total ballots received br and the sum of the ballots remaining bs plus the sum of votes obtained by each political party , including null votes @xmath18 v@xmath8 , i.e. , br-(bs+@xmath19 v@xmath8 )",
    ". both distributions should give a delta function @xmath10 in the ideal case .",
    "but , as seen in figure  [ fig : lostdeposited ] , it is very asymmetric and present extreme values around @xmath0 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lostballots ] . in the insets",
    "we show that typos are also present and that power laws appear",
    ".    in the previous analysis all the cabins were considered , notwithstanding the fact that a selection is required , since many of records present alterations as was documented in ref .",
    "however , statistical analyses , like the present one are valid , since the universal source of error must be studied for future references .",
    "other errors , random or systematic , require future analysis as well .",
    "v@xmath8 , that is br-(bs+@xmath19 v@xmath8 ) .",
    "the meaning of the right and the left distribution branches is similar to that in figure [ fig : lostballots ] .",
    "notice that the three distributions are similar .",
    "the inset shows both branches of the distributions in log - log scale . ]",
    "histograms of the number of electoral cabins ( polling stations ) with a certain number of votes are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] .",
    "the results for p1-p3 presidential candidates appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram](a ) and the corresponding results for deputies and senators in panels ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "panel ( d ) of this figure corresponds to p4 , p5 , non - registered candidates and null votes for the presidential election .",
    "histograms for the votes of p2 change very slowly in the three cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram](a ) to ( c ) ) .",
    "the tail of these distributions looks exponential ( a fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pridistribution ] ) .",
    "this is not the case for the distributions of the two main presidential candidates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram](a ) ) .",
    "the distribution of the votes for p1 shows a very different behavior for electoral cabins with less than @xmath20 votes , since it starts flat .",
    "the distribution for p3 is also irregular .",
    "it shows three different regimes .",
    "it appears like a distribution in which realizations between 60 and 300 votes are missing .",
    "this could be due to two reasons : the first , is that the data were manipulated ; the second , is that the distribution of the votes for p3 is composed of two or more distributions corresponding to several voter dynamics  @xcite . as an example , a weighted sum of two distributions @xmath21 with different centroids , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , like a daisy model ( see below ) and a log - normal could give place to such deformed distributions .",
    "both functions correspond to different groups of voters , the first one to corporate voters  @xcite and the other to certain proportional elections @xcite .",
    "the distributions for the senators and deputies present similar behavior as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "in fact , the participation of a uniform group of voter in important elections is , a priori , unlikely ; so , it is enough to have two kind of voters following distribution with different maxima to have such a behavior .",
    "the histograms for the parties with a small number of votes are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram](d ) .",
    "as seen , all histograms have a similar behavior , except for a small numbers of votes .",
    "all are shifted power - laws , except for the p4 presidential candidate which present deviations .",
    "the results for deputies and senators for the same parties are similar ( not shown ) .",
    "these results can be explained with several models of cluster growth in complex networks  @xcite , for instance , and appear in other electoral processes  @xcite for proportional votes . behind all these works",
    "are the search for a universal dynamics in voting processes .",
    "we found an inconsistency in the tail of the annulled votes .",
    "this distribution shows several electoral cabins with more than 100 annulled votes .",
    "the probability of having such results is negligible , so that these results are not statistical .    finally , we return to the p2 case .",
    "the distribution of votes for this party is clearly smooth and a fit using the so called daisy models  @xcite was performed previously on the final records for mexican elections in 2000 , 2003 and 2006  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding fitting for the prep data corresponds to a rank @xmath24 model @xmath25 for the distribution s central part , and an @xmath26 model    @xmath27    for the tail . a plot on the normalized distribution of votes appears in figure  [ fig : pridistribution ] .",
    "here the normalization of votes is performed using a @xmath28th degree polynomial on windows of 300 and 3000 cabin certificates obtaining a reliable average density of events .",
    "notice that no fitting parameter was used , in contrast to considering a brody or a weibull distributions .",
    "we studied the statistical properties of the mexican elections using the program of preliminary electoral results ( prep ) database .",
    "we have shown that the appearance of the data in real time are not distributed in a random way , and that this depends on the way the sample is taken .",
    "evidence of correlations between parties with large numbers of votes and small numbers of votes is evident .",
    "there is also evidence of correlation with the annulled votes .",
    "quantities that should be conserved , for self - consistency of the records , were studied .",
    "the distribution of such quantities have two main behaviors , with a power law in the central part instead of the expected gaussian or lorentzian distribution .",
    "unexplained peaks are present in all the distributions ( see figures [ fig : lostballots]-[fig : lostvotes ] . )",
    "we suppose that they are due to typos in the capture of the data .",
    "the number of records with inconsistencies is around @xmath12 in all cases , for the president election and for the upper and lower chambers as well .",
    "we also have obtained the distributions of votes for the different parties . in particular",
    ", the distribution of the party that was in power in mexico during more than @xmath29 years behaves smoothly .",
    "daisy models of 2nd and 3rd rank seem to fit different parts of the measured distribution .",
    "in contrast , the distributions of the parties with more votes are more complex and , probably , composed of different voters dynamics .",
    "distributions of small parties follow power laws .",
    "the difference between the first and second place should be larger than the error associated to the measurement , in this case , the electoral processes .",
