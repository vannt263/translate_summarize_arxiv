    "warm ( @xmath13 k ) ionized hydrogen is an important component of our galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the diffuse warm ionized medium ( wim ) of the galaxy has a mass surface density one third that of neutral hydrogen ( ) , with an extended vertical scale height ( @xmath14 pc ) , and a power requirement equivalent to the total kinetic energy injected into the ism by supernovae ( kulkarni & heiles 1987 ; reynolds 1991b ) .",
    "the wim has principally been studied through the detection of faint emission lines ( e.g. , reynolds  1998b ) and through the dispersion measures of radio emission from distant pulsars ( taylor & cordes 1993 ; reynolds 1991a ) .",
    "the goal of this work is to determine if there is evidence for dust grains in the ionized medium of the galaxy , including low - density  regions and the diffuse wim .",
    "the distinction between regions and the wim in this work is mainly one of distance from the source of ionization and possibly fractional ionization .",
    "the existence of dust in the wim of the galaxy has important ramifications for the heating ( and cooling ) of the gas and possibly also for the power requirements of the ionization .",
    "photoelectric emission of electrons from the surfaces of dust grains is an important source of heating in the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) of the galaxy ( wolfire 1995a ) .",
    "reynolds & cox ( 1992 ) have shown that , if grains are present in the wim , photoelectric emission may be the dominant source of heating in the wim and may also be responsible for the enhanced forbidden line strengths that are characteristic of the wim ( e.g. , dettmar & shulz 1992 ; rand 1997 , 1998 ) .    to provide evidence for the existence of dust in this important phase of the ism , we will measure the gas - phase abundance of al relative to s in ionized gas . in the warm neutral medium",
    "relative gas - phase abundances , derived from absorption line spectroscopy , have been used to infer the elemental composition of dust grains ( see savage & sembach 1996b and references therein ) .",
    "we apply this method to the ionized medium of the galaxy .",
    "absorption line spectroscopy of interstellar material yields column densities of species independent of the prevailing physical conditions ( e.g. , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) . in table",
    "[ table : uvprobes ] we list the properties of several possibly important probes of weakly ionized gas in the vacuum ultraviolet .",
    "along with the wavelengths and @xmath17-values ( from morton 1991 ) for the transitions given , we also give relevant ionization potentials , logarithmic solar - system abundances of the elemental species relative to h ( anders & grevesse 1989 ; grevesse & noels 1993 ) , and representative values of the gas - phase abundances of each of the elemental species in warm neutral halo gas ( see savage & sembach 1996b ) . the lines and ionic species listed in table [ table : uvprobes ] are those likely to provide measurable column densities in the spectral range accessible to the uv spectrographs previously or currently on  ( @xmath18  ) and lines accessible to the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ , which will cover the wavelength range @xmath19   after its launch in early-1999",
    ". the last two columns of table [ table : uvprobes ] give the expected column density of each ionic tracer for a completely ionized region with halo - like abundances having @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is expressed in ) and total hydrogen density @xmath22 3 , as well as the expected peak optical depth of each line in the case of pure thermal broadening with @xmath23 k. these optical depths will be less if non - thermal broadening plays a significant role ( a likely situation ) .",
    "those ions from table [ table : uvprobes ] accessible to  include 3 , 3 , 3 , , and .",
    "given the great strength or weakness of many of the lines from table [ table : uvprobes ] , one is typically able to measure a tracer of a non - depleted element ( see spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ; fitzpatrick & spitzer 1994 , 1997 ) in the ionized gas ( 3)iii line is blended with intermediate - velocity absorption from the strong si@xmath24ii line at ( @xmath25  relative to s@xmath24iii ) ; this is particularly true for observations made at intermediate resolution ( @xmath26 ) . ] and a tracer of a refractory element in ionized gas ( 3 ) in the  bandpass .",
    "relatively little is known about the galactic distribution of these ionized gas tracers .",
    "savage , edgar , & diplas ( 1990 ) used the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ to study the distribution of 3  in the galaxy .",
    "they find an exponential scale - height of @xmath27 kpc for the distribution of 3 , thereby showing the distribution of 3  is slightly more extended than the neutral gas ( @xmath28 kpc towards these same objects ) and similar to that of free electrons . from the ratios of the estimated vertical column densities of 3  and free electrons ( which are assumed to trace the protons of the wim ) they infer a gas - phase abundance of [ al / h]@xmath29 in the ionized gas ( using the solar system abundance",
    "al / h given in table [ table : uvprobes ] ) .",
    "sembach & savage ( 1992 ) have also studied the properties of 3absorption towards a number of halo stars .",

    "the paths through the ionized ism are dominated by the wim , by which we mean diffuse gas at large distances from any ionizing star .",
    "the species 3  and 3  require more energy for creation than the h@xmath32 typically used to probe the wim ; however , these ions likely represent significant fractions of the s and al associated with the wim . in all cases we depend upon the use of an ionization correction factor to determine the relative abundances presented here .",

    "the spectra have been calibrated using the standard calhrs routine which includes conversion of raw counts to count rates and corrections for particle radiation contamination , dark counts , known diode non - uniformities , paired pulse events and scattered light .",
    "the final data reduction was performed using software developed and tested at the university of wisconsin - madison .",
    "this includes the merging of individual spectra and allowing for additional refinements to the scattered light correction for the echelle - mode data ( cardelli , ebbets , & savage 1993 ) .",

    "the observations of the 3   region using the g160 m grating have a velocity resolution of @xmath34 , while in the 3 region the resolution is @xmath35  ( fwhm ) . for the g160 m data we have used the spybal observations taken before the science integrations to refine the absolute velocity scales ( see soderblom , sherbert , & hulbert 1993 , 1994 ) .",

    "the echelle observations of 3  towards  was there structure deemed to be possibly significant to the current work ; these are the only observations for which we have applied the fixed - pattern noise solutions .",

    "table [ table : columns ] contains the measured equivalent widths and column densities of interstellar 3  and 3  towards our six targets , along with the @xmath48 uncertainties in these quantities .",
    "these uncertainties include contributions from photon statistics , continuum placement uncertainties , and zero - level uncertainties .",
    "we have adopted a 2% zero - level uncertainty throughout .",
    "this may overestimate the errors in regions near heavily saturated lines , i.e. , in the wavelength region of 3 .",
    "see sembach & savage ( 1992 ; their appendix ) and howk  ( 1998 ) for a more thorough discussion of these sources of uncertainty .    for the echelle data",
    "the values of the column densities presented in table [ table : columns ] were derived by a straight integration of the apparent column density profiles ( savage & sembach 1991 ) . in the absence of unresolved saturated structure , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the apparent and true column densities of the ion @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the 3  lines observed towards and  are the only profiles for which we might expect the presence of unresolved saturated structure .",
    "though the profiles seem resolved by the echelle - mode resolution , the value @xmath53 for the  and  sightlines may underestimate the total column density . for gas at @xmath54",
    "k , the thermal doppler spread parameters for 3  and 3  are @xmath55  and @xmath56  ( fwhm@xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ) .",

    "intermediate velocity  absorption is seen towards  at velocities near the restframe of 3 . in both the 3  and profiles ,",
    "an absorbing component is present near @xmath59 .",
    "the corresponding 3absorption is blended with the intermediate velocity absorption .",
    "therefore we report the column densities of 3  and 3  for this sightline integrated over the velocity range @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "this only includes the lower - velocity 3absorbing component .",
    "we do not expect any  absorption in this velocity range given the profile of the line present in the same  observation .",
    "the 3   lines observed towards  and 18100  with the g160 m grating are blended with the nearby line ( @xmath62  relative to 3 ) . to assess the extent of the blending , we have performed a component fitting analysis of these profiles using software kindly provided to us by e. fitzpatrick and described in spitzer & fitzpatrick ( 1993 ;",
    "hereafter sf93 ) .",
    "a model of the interstellar absorption was convolved with the instrumental lsf appropriate for the pre - costar ssa , and the value of @xmath63 minimized between this model and the data .",
    "the lsf adopted here for the ssa follows spitzer & fitzpatrick ( 1995 ) in using instrumental lsf given for the g160 m grating in the instrument handbook ( v3.0 ; duncan 1992 , table 4 - 8 ) .",
    "the lsf is well characterized by a gaussian with a fwhm @xmath64 diodes at the detector array . from these models ,",

    "we have fit the line with a four - component model and subsequently fixed the values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 from this fit , though allowing common shifts in the velocities , to describe the absorption .",

    "however , we have fit the line present in the g160 m observation to assess the contribution of intermediate - velocity absorption to the 3  profile .",

    "this model has been scaled by the appropriate factor to account for the differing oscillator strengths of the 1190 and 1193 transitions of  and shifted to the velocity scale of 3 .",

    "we have held the column density of this component fixed when fitting the 3 + blend at 1190  .",
    "we find the component is relatively weak , of order 12% of the 3  column density at these velocities .",

    "we find that the equivalent width is within the range covered by the two 3transitions , and the peak optical depth is very similar to that found in the 3   profile ( though it includes a small contribution from the overlapping line ) .",
    "the data for 3  and 3  along the sightline to 18100  are shown in figure [ fig : spectra2 ] as points , while the component models for each species are plotted as solid lines .",

    "the most important effects are caused by the incorporation of possibly important coolants into the solid phase ( shields & kennicutt 1995 ) , the change in the thermal balance due to photoelectron emission ( heating ) and far - infrared thermal dust emission ( cooling ) , and the competition of the dust opacity with h and he for ionizing photons ( mathis 1986b ) .",

    "\\6 ) if the wim of the galaxy is ionized by the light from ob stars ( reynolds 1984 ) , the observed 3  and 3  column densities towards 18100  and  imply the existence of al - bearing dust in the wim . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first evidence for dust in the galactic diffuse ionized gas , though the effects of collisional ionization can not be ruled out , particularly for the sightline towards 18100 .",
    "\\7 ) the gas - phase abundances [ al / s]@xmath12 in the ionized material increases with height @xmath90 above the galactic plane .",
    "further , the values [ al / s]@xmath12 increase with decreasing average or rms electron densities _ and _ with decreasing average sightline neutral hydrogen density .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of the gas - phase refractory abundances in the warm neutral medium of the galaxy ( jenkins 1987 ; bohlin & savage 1979 ) .",
    "this general trend implies a greater return of elements to the gas phase in more diffuse environments .",
    "\\8 ) the observed values of [ al / s]@xmath12 are similar to the abundances of other refractory elements seen in the wnm of the disk and halo .",
    "further , the variation of [ al / s]@xmath12 with density ( electron or neutral ) is also similar to the values observed for refractory elements in the wnm ( esp . , fe or mn ) .",
    "our analysis implies that the processing of dust grains in the ionized gas may not be much different than that in the low - density warm neutral medium .",
    "\\9 ) we discuss the velocity structure of the wim along the two high - latitude sightlines in our sample .",
    "these directions show a very close relationship between the tracers of neutral material and ionized gas , similar to the correspondence observed by spitzer & fitzpatrick ( 1993 ) .",
    "the data show no kinematic evidence for a separation of the ionized and neutral material .",
    "this is consistent with a partially - ionized medium in which the neutrals and ions are well mixed ( e.g. , sf93 ) , the neutral clouds are surrounded by ionized envelopes ( e.g. , mckee & ostriker 1977 ) , or other more complex scenarios .",
    "we have benefitted from conversations with r. reynolds , b. benjamin , and j. mathis in preparing this manuscript .",
    "we also thank e. jenkins for a careful reading of our work and for suggestions that improved the final result .",
    "we thank e. fitzpatrick for sharing his component fitting software with us , and m. haffner , r. reynolds , and the group for sharing their results in advance of publication .",
    "we feel g. ferland and his co - workers at the university of kentucky have done a great service for the astronomical community in making available their photoionization code cloudy .",
