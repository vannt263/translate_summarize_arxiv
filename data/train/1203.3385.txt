    "shortly after the discovery of pulsars @xcite , the potential role of magnetic fields in the core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion mechanism began to be investigated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle , a differentially rotating proto - neutron star ( pns ) could give rise to magnetically powered explosions .",
    "an early conclusion , however , was that ( unrealistically ) rapid rotation _ and _ strong magnetic fields would be needed at the pre - collapse stage for magnetic fields to play a principal role in the explosion dynamics @xcite .",
    "more recently , interest in strong magnetic fields has returned in connection with a number of observables related to ccsne , including asymmetries in the explosion ejecta @xcite , natal neutron star kick velocities @xcite , and the high - energy electromagnetic activity connected to some neutron stars known as magnetars , or anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical discovery of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite and its application to ccsne @xcite has also contributed to renewed interest in the possible role of magnetic fields in the explosion of some supernovae ( i.e. , those from rapidly rotating progenitor cores ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "still , magneto - rotationally driven ccsne likely would be peculiar events , since magnetic progenitor cores tend to rotate slowly @xcite .",
    "leaving aside the explosion mechanism , the relationship between the formation of neutron star magnetic fields and ccsne is still an open and interesting question , particularly in the case of axps and sgrs @xcite ( although magneto - rotational processes are likely involved @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of sufficient rotational energy in magnetized pre - collapse progenitor cores , as predicted by stellar evolution models , has sparked some recent interest in mhd processes in non - rotating ccsn environments @xcite .",
    "in particular , endeve et al .",
    "@xcite studied magnetic field amplification by the stationary accretion shock instability ( sasi @xcite ) .",
    "the sasi may play an important role in neutrino - powered explosions @xcite .",
    "thus , magnetic fields may be an important part of a supernova model if the sasi is found to be sensitive to their presence .",
    "this paper complements the investigations initiated in @xcite .",
    "we begin with a description of the numerical methods used ( the initial implementation of mhd in our astrophysical simulation code genasis ) , including results from some standard tests .",
    "then , with a new set of high - resolution simulations , we investigate the growth and impact of magnetic fields during operation of the sasi .",
    "we also attempt to quantify the levels of neutron star magnetization that may result from sasi dynamics .",
    "we find that the magnetic energy may grow exponentially in turbulent flows driven by the spiral sasi mode .",
    "( the magnetic energy growth time , based on the turnover time of sasi - driven turbulence , is estimated to be a few milliseconds . )",
    "the presence of amplified magnetic fields results in less kinetic energy on small spatial scales , but we find no impact of magnetic fields on global shock dynamics .",
    "however , magnetic field evolution remains sensitive to numerical resolution .",
    "we argue that mhd processes associated with the sasi may contribute significantly to strong , small - scale pns magnetic fields , and provide a connection between the magnetic fields of neutron stars at birth and supernova dynamics .",
    "the saturation energies may be sufficient to power flaring activity of axps , and possibly sgrs .",

    "the presence of amplified magnetic fields does not result in noticeable effects on the global shock dynamics in our simulations , and this may be understood from considerations of the energetics : the turbulent kinetic energy  which powers sasi - driven field amplification  only amounts to about @xmath182 of the total kinetic energy below the shock ( @xmath236  b ) , and is not significant to the explosion ( @xmath237  b ) .",

    "the magnetic energy attained and the rate at which the magnetic energy grows increase with increasing grid resolution .",
    "data extracted from our simulations suggest that the magnetic energy may grow exponentially on a millisecond timescale ( @xmath238 ) under more realistic physical conditions ( i.e. , huge magnetic reynolds numbers ) , as opposed to the @xmath239-@xmath240  ms timescale measured directly in our runs .",
    "model @xmath166 attains dynamically relevant magnetic fields , which are also subject to significant numerical dissipation .",
    "the mhd evolution displayed by this model during the saturated state is probably spurious and the dynamical impact of the @xmath203-fields may be underestimated .",
    "we therefore caution that the uncertainties associated with the sensitivity to numerical resolution prevents us from completely dismissing magnetic fields as unimportant to the explosion dynamics of weakly rotating progenitors . in summary",
    ", we conclude from our simulations that magnetic fields in ccsne may be amplified exponentially by turbulence driven by the spiral sasi mode .",
    "details on the impact of sasi - amplified magnetic fields on explosion dynamics remain unclear , but on energetic grounds alone the role of these magnetic fields is likely sub - dominant .",
