    "absolutely irreducible @xmath2-local systems can underlie at most one polarized variation of hodge structure , which suggests that the asymptotics of such variations at a puncture should exhibit interesting arithmetic . for variations of motivic origin ,",

    "conjecture [ conj ggk ] below .",
    "the mumford - tate group @xmath3 of the vhs imposes its own algebraic constraints upon these extensions , which can simplify the form of the conjecture .",
    "given a @xmath3-rigid local system , the middle convolutions of katz @xcite give some hope for constructing a family of motives with the local system ( and vhs ) appearing in its cohomology .",
    "this paper was motivated by the desire to check the conjectural property for some local systems on the thrice - punctured sphere underlying motivic vhs of type @xmath4 and @xmath5 , at a point of maximal unipotent monodromy .",
    "variations with extremal hodge numbers @xmath6 have been called `` calabi - yau '' for some time ; when all the hodge numbers are @xmath6 , terminology from representation theory ( `` principal @xmath7 '' ) suggests calling them `` principal '' .",
    "robles s recent classification @xcite of the corresponding hodge representations rules out all exceptional groups except for @xmath1 as mumford - tate group , which itself can only occur in the weight / level 6 case .",
    "moreover , the effects of @xmath1 on the limiting mhs are well - understood via boundary components @xcite , a story which is briefly reviewed in @xmath8 .",
    "our first main point is that a recent result of iritani in mirror symmetry @xcite allows one to compute the limiting extension classes for many of the @xmath4 examples classified by doran and morgan @xcite . if @xmath9 is a complete intersection cy 3-fold in a weighted projective space with rank 4 even cohomology , we use iritani s @xmath10 integral structure on its quantum cohomology to give a straightforward computation of the ( large complex structure ) limiting period matrix @xmath11 of the vhs arising from @xmath12 of the mirror family ( cf . ) . in particular ,",
    "the nontorsion extension class @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the second point is that using middle convolution , one may construct interesting motivic variations not treatable by mirror symmetry , but where the limiting periods may be computed directly by a residue method .",
    "this approach , which we apply in @xmath15 to two examples ( including one with @xmath1 monodromy ) from the work of dettweiler and reiter @xcite , shows promise more generally for cyclic covers branched along a union of hyperplanes .",
    "moreover , it gives a clearer picture of the origin of the zeta values in limiting extension classes , which in @xmath164 is buried in a deep mirror theorem .",
    "the main idea is that katz s method builds a sequence of families @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) of the form @xmath19 , whose @xmath20 period in a neighborhood of the point @xmath21 of maximal unipotency is given by the iterative formula @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the top weight graded piece of @xmath24 contains a principal variation ( at least , for @xmath25 ) , and all the data of @xmath11 for this vhs is contained in the asymptotics of @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 , we are able to completely determine these asymptotics ( theorem [ thm : d=00003d3 ] ) , and hence the extension class @xmath28",
    ". our luck did not hold out for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , where we were only able to compute `` part '' of the integral ; however , this piece does contain a term of the form @xmath31 as expected ( `` towards '' the extension class in @xmath32 ) , and conjecture [ conj : d=00003d6 ] represents an educated guess at the entire thing .",
    "moreover , our partial computation contains a ravishing number - theoretic tidbit , which we call the _",
    "@xmath1-identity _    @xmath33 @xmath34 ( here @xmath35 means to sum over tuples of non - negative integers for which the summand is defined . )",
    "this identity is _ a consequence of the vanishing of the _ _ with @xmath1 mumford - tate group _ , and ( bizarrely ) it is needed to finish off the @xmath27 computation .",
    "our computations also make heavy use of some identities relating hypergeometric special values and riemann zeta values ; how to derive these is outlined in the appendix .    in writing this paper we encountered several questions which merit further investigation . for example , is there a direct construction of `` limiting data '' , from a quasi - unipotent @xmath3-rigid local system @xmath36 over @xmath37 , that does not pass through variations of hodge structure ? here",
    "the motivation is that there should exist a unique vhs underlain by @xmath36 , cf .",
    "remark [ simpson conj ] . in the middle convolution case ,",
    "is there a better approach to computing the lmhs than direct computation of asymptotics of @xmath26 , perhaps one extending the computation of the lmhs hodge numbers in @xcite ?",
    "finally , can one use mirror symmetry to compute any limiting extension classes in @xmath32 ? here",
    "the problem is typically that some extension class in @xmath38 is nonzero , and then one of the previous form is not well - defined ; but even in this case it would still be of interest to compute @xmath11 ( say , for cy 5- or 6-folds ) .",
