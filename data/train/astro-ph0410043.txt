    "stars with masses @xmath6 have upper convective zones where the stochastic excitation of p  modes takes place . models of stochastic excitation yield the rate @xmath0 at which p modes are excited by turbulent convection but require an accurate knowledge of the time averaged and -   above all   - the dynamic properties of turbulent convection . the latter are represented in the approach of samadi & goupil ( 2001 ) by @xmath4 , the frequency component of the kinetic energy spectrum , also designed as the convective eddy time - correlations .",
    "a gaussian is usually assumed for @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ in other word it is usually assumed that two distant points in the turbulent medium are uncorrelated . here , we investigate two different forms for @xmath4 : the gaussian and the lorentzian .",
    "we consider a set of 3d simulations of solar - like oscillating stars .",
    "we compute internal structure of 1d stellar models and associated eigenfunctions consistent with the 3d simulations .",
    "the 3d simulations provide constraints on the turbulent kinetic spectrum @xmath7 .",
    "theses constraints enable us to compute @xmath1 , the maximum in @xmath0 , for the 1d internal models consistent with the 3d simulations ( see details in samadi et al , 2004 ) .",
    "versus @xmath5 : the crosses assume a gaussian for @xmath4 and the squares a lorentzian respectively .",
    "the lines are the results of fitting each set of dots with a power law of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the slope of the power law .",
    ", width=340 ]    results of the calculations of @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "we find that @xmath1 scales as @xmath9 where @xmath3 is the slope of the scaling law , @xmath10 is the luminosity and @xmath11 is the mass of the 1d  models associated with the 3d simulations .",
    "the value found for @xmath3 is sensitive to the choice for @xmath4 : indeed the gaussian results in @xmath12 and the lorentzian in @xmath13 .",
    "solar seismic observations can clearly distinguish between the two forms for @xmath4 : they favor the lorentzian ( see samadi et al , 2003 ) .",
    "for other stars for which stochastically excited p modes are expected , the lorentzian is likely to remain the correct form for @xmath4 , but this needs to be confirmed .",
    "the high - quality data of the corot instrument will enable us to derive @xmath1 as a function of l and m for the different target stars .",
    "these data will very likely enable us to determine the appropriate model for the eddy time - correlations ( @xmath4 ) .",
