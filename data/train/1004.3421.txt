    "rotation curves of spiral galaxies are one of the most important tools to investigate the content and distribution of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "they have been used for a variety of purposes , in particular to investigate their systematic properties ( persic , salucci & stel 1996 , salucci et al . 2007 , gentile 2008 ) , to test the validity of the predictions of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory ( e.g. , de blok et al .",

    "2000 , mcgaugh 2005a , gentile et al .",
    "2009 , donato et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "testing the validity of the cdm predictions is a very important issue , because ( cdm - only ) simulations result in dark matter halos with an almost universal density profile ( the details of how universal the profile actually is have extensively been discussed in the literature ) , which is well described by the nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) halo , characterised by a central density cusp ( the density @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath4 when the radius @xmath5 tends to zero , but see also section [ sect_results ] ) , whereas observations tend to indicate the presence of a constant density core .",
    "the influence of baryons on the distribution of dark matter is a crucial point ; however , there is no general consensus about what the dominant effect(s ) is(are ) .",
    "a non - exhaustive list of ways by which baryons can change the distribution of dark matter includes : adiabatic contraction ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 , gnedin et al .",
    "2004 , sellwood & mcgaugh 2005 ) , the influence of bars ( e.g. , weinberg & katz 2002 , mcmillan & dehnen 2005 , sellwood 2008 ) , or the influence of gas ( mashchenko , couchman & wadsley 2006 , governato et al .",
    "because of the additional complication brought by baryons , dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are better suited for deriving the properties of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "an alternative explanation to dark matter in galaxies is mond ( modified newtonian dynamics , introduced by milgrom 1983 ) , where the effective gravitational acceleration becomes stronger than expected in the newtonian case , when the gravitational acceleration falls below a critical value , @xmath6 cm s@xmath7 .",
    "mond explains very well the observed kinematical properties of galaxies : lsb galaxies ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) , tidal dwarf galaxies ( gentile et al .",

    "2007 ) , and galaxy scaling relation in general , such as the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( mcgaugh 2005b ) . however , let us note that the mond prescription is not sufficient to explain the observed discrepancy between luminous and dynamical mass in galaxy clusters ( e.g. angus et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the dwarf galaxy ngc 1560 , whose rotation curve was derived by broeils ( 1992 , hereafter b92 ) based on wsrt ( westerbork synthesis radio telescope ) observations , is a nearby sd galaxy with an absolute b - band magnitude of @xmath8 ( krismer et al .",
    "1995 , assuming a distance of 3.5 mpc )",
    ". estimates of its distance vary significantly from one study to another : values from 2.5 mpc ( lee & madore 1993 ) to 3.7 mpc ( sandage 1988 ) can be found .",
    "b92 assumed a distance of 3 mpc .",
    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find @xmath9 mpc from the tip of the red giant branch method , using hst data .",
    "we assume this value unless stated otherwise , because it is one of the most accurate to date .",
    "ngc 1560 is a very interesting galaxy to study because it is the stereotypical galaxy displaying what is known as `` renzo s rule '' ( from sancisi 2004 ) : for every feature in the distribution of visible matter there is a corresponding feature in the total distribution of matter . in the rotation curve of ngc 1560 , as derived by b92 , there is a clear `` wiggle '' in the total rotation velocity , which corresponds very closely to a similar wiggle in the gas contribution to the rotation curve .",
    "mass models such as mond naturally reproduce the feature , whereas models that include a dominant spherical ( or triaxial ) halo are too smooth to do so .",
    "this motivated us to reobserve ngc 1560 at higher resolution , to independently trace the rotation curve and probe the region around the velocity wiggle .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present an analysis of hi observations performed with the gmrt ( giant metrewave radio telescope ) which have a spatial resolution almost two times better than the data presented in b92 .",
    "we re - derive the rotation curve and make mass models , with various assumptions concerning the distribution of dark matter .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the observations were performed on 13 - 14 september 2007 at the gmrt .",
    "the correlator setup was such that the total bandwidth was 2 mhz , with 128 channels centred around a heliocentric ( optical definition ) systemic velocity of -36 km s@xmath2 .",
    "after hanning smoothing , the velocity resolution of our datacube is 6.7 km s@xmath2 .",
    "standard calibration and editing procedures were performed within the aips ( astronomical image processing system ) software package .",
    "the absolute flux and bandpass calibration were performed using the standard calibrators 3c 48 and 3c 147 , whereas the phase calibrator was chosen to be 0410 + 769 .",
    "after calibration , the data were continuum - subtracted using line - free channels on either side of the channels with line emission .",
    "imaging was performed using the task imagr in aips . to avoid resolving excessively the extended structure , after various attempts we decided that a gaussian taper of 25 k@xmath10 provides a good compromise between resolution and sensitivity to extended emission .",
    "the synthesized beam of our final high - resolution maps is 8.1@xmath11 , which is almost a factor of 2 better than b92 ( whose beam size was 14@xmath12 ) . in the first maps we produced , we noticed the presence of a weak `` negative bowl '' around the emission , characteristic of missing short - spacing information .",
    "however , following greisen , spekkens & van moorsel ( 2009 ) , we used the technique of multi - scale clean , which they found can eliminate most of the negative flux around the emission , and thus solve almost completely the missing short - spacing problem .",
    "as we explain in the next section , the use of multi - scale clean likely enabled us to recover most of the hi flux of ngc 1560 .",
    "the final high - resolution datacube is shown in fig . [ channels_hires ] .",
    "one can notice that the emission traces the rotation of a highly inclined ( but not fully edge - on ) disk .",
    "the rms noise in the channel maps is 0.8 mjy beam@xmath2 .",
    "a few channels around zero velocity have significantly higher noise , which can be explained by the presence of very diffuse , low - surface brightness emission due to galactic hi .    the total hi flux ( calculated from the primary beam corrected low - resolution cube ) is 294.6 jy km s@xmath2 , which is 23 % lower than b92 , but is consistent with the single - dish total flux of 290 jy km s@xmath2 given by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "importantly , the total flux of our hi datacube derived with the point - source clean would have been 32 % lower , showing the ability of multi - scale clean to deal with short spacing data . the total hi map ( moment-0 map )",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ mom0_hires ] .",
    "to better study the extended , low surface brightness emission , we constructed a low - resolution datacube with a beam of @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting total hi map , superimposed with an optical image of ngc 1560 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ mom0_lores_opt ] .",
    "we derived the surface density profile by averaging over ellipses using the geometrical parameters derived in the next section .",
    "small changes in the geometrical parameters do not affect significantly the resulting surface density profile , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ surfdens ] .",
    "similarly to what b92 found , the hi distribution is quite symmetric , apart from the `` bump '' around 300 - 350 @xmath14 , which is very promiment on the northern side and just hinted at on the southern side .",
    "the velocity field of ngc 1560 was derived using the wamet method ( gentile et al .",
    "2004 , where the velocity in each position of the velocity field is derived using only the side of the velocity profile opposite to the systemic velocity ) , which gives better results than traditional methods ( such as the intensity - weighted mean ) when projection and/or resolution effects are expected to be non - negligible . in the case of ngc 1560 , because of its high inclination angle , projection effects could potentially bias towards lower rotation velocities ( see e.g. sancisi & allen 1979 ) , therefore we decided to use the method described in gentile et al .",
    "( 2004 ) instead of the intensity - weighted mean .",
    "the velocity field , overlaid with the total hi map , is shown in fig .",
    "[ mom0_hires_velfi ] .",
    "once the velocity field was constructed , we derived the rotation curve using the task rotcur in gipsy ( groningen imaging processing system ) , which makes a tilted - ring model of the velocity field ( begeman 1989 ) .",
    "several attempts were made to leave as many free parameters as possible , and at the same time have stable solutions for the rings with enough points .",
    "we ended up leaving as free parameters ( apart from the rotation velocity ) the position angle and the systemic velocity .",
    "the inclination was fixed at its average value .",
    "then , based on the rotation curve , the geometrical parameters derived from the tilted - ring modelling of the velocity field , on an assumed scale - height of the hi layer of 0.2 kpc ( barbieri et al . , 2005 ) , an hi velocity dispersion of 10 km s@xmath2 ( tamburro et al . , 2009 ) , and the surface density profile , we built model datacubes to check the validity of our derived parameters .",
    "comparison with the data was made channel map by channel map and on the moment maps .",
    "in particular , it turns out that , in order to reproduce the total hi map , the inclination angle had to be changed from 78@xmath15 to 82@xmath15 ( and the rotation velocity was corrected by a factor sin(78@xmath15)/sin(82@xmath15 ) ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mom0_incl ] .",
    "once this change was made , the agreement between the model datacube and the observed one is excellent , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ channels_datiemod.hires ] .",
    "also , contrary to gentile et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , the central channel maps are well reproduced without the need of introducing non - circular motions in the model datacube .",
    "the rotation curve ( fig . [ rcfit.comparisonbr ] ) is very similar to the one derived by b92 .",
    "the last four points of the rotation curve were derived using the velocity field made from the low - resolution data cube .",
    "the largest differences between our rotation curve and the one derived by b92 are of order @xmath1 km s@xmath2 in the innermost @xmath0 , where projection effects are expected to be stronger .",
    "then , before making the mass models , the rotation curve was corrected for asymmetric drift following b92 and skillman et al .",
    "the corrections were smaller than the errorbars .",
    "for the last three data points of the rotation curve ( when the surface density , of at least one side of the galaxy , drops below 1 m@xmath16 pc@xmath7 ) , we did not apply the correction , as it would be too uncertain because it would imply dividing by values of the surface density very close to zero .",
    "the errorbars on the rotation curve were calculated from the difference between the approaching and the receding side ; a minimum realistic error of 2 km s@xmath2 was taken into account .",
    "the rotation curve determined separately for the two sides of the galaxy is shown in fig .",
    "[ rcfit.apprecsep ] .",
    "similarly to what b92 had found , we find that globally the rotation curve is quite symmetric , but that in the region between 200@xmath14 and 350@xmath14 the asymmetries are largest , typically of order @xmath17 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we note that the wiggle is clearly present on one side ( the northern side ) and barely visible on the other side ; in this respect , the kinematic asymmetry is very similar to the surface density asymmetry .",
    "the contribution of the gaseous disk to the rotation curve ( @xmath18 ) was derived using the task rotmod in gipsy , which makes use of the method outlined in casertano ( 1983 ) .",
    "we used the surface density profile derived in section [ sect_hi ] and we assumed the same scale - height as in our model datacubes , i.e. 0.2 kpc .",
    "different ( but realistic ) values of the scale - height do not affect @xmath18 significantly .",
    "the hi surface density distribution was then multiplied by a factor 1.33 to account for primordial helium .    in order to derive the shape of the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve ( @xmath19 ) , we applied the rotmod to the i - band photometric data obtained by buta & mccall ( 1999 ) .",
    "also in this case , we assumed a scale - height of 0.2 kpc . using the range of major - axis scale lengths given in buta & mccall , and assuming that the scale length / scale height ratio is 7.3 ( kregel , van der kruit & de grijs 2002 ) , we find a possible range of scale heights of @xmath20 kpc .",
    "again , assuming an infinitely thin disk or a thicker - but realistic - disk would not significantly change the resulting @xmath19 .",
    "the absolute scaling of @xmath19 depends on the stellar mass - to - light ( @xmath21 ) ratio .",
    "one way of estimating its value is from stellar population synthesis models , which find a correlation between observed colour and @xmath21 ratio .",
    "we used the method described in bell & de jong ( 2001 ) , and from the @xmath22 colour given in buta & mccall ( 1999 ) we found and i - band ( @xmath23 ) mass - to - light ratio of 1.43 .",
    "a secure assessment of the uncertainty on this value is virtually impossible to give , because it combines observational and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we estimate it to be around 0.2 dex ( de jong & bell 2007 ) , therefore in our fits we leave @xmath23 as a free parameter , constrained within 0.2 dex around 1.43 .              to explain the mass discrepancy in ngc 1560 , one has to resort to either a dark matter halo or mond .",
    "for the dark matter halo , we considered two different possibilities : a burkert halo and an nfw halo ( see also section [ sect_results ] for a discussion of the einasto halo ) .",
    "the burkert halo ( burkert 1995 , salucci & burkert 2001 ) is an empirical functional form for the density distribution of dark matter in galaxies ( @xmath24 ) , which generally gives good fits to rotation curves :    @xmath25    were @xmath26 is the central density and @xmath27 is the core radius .",
    "the burkert halo has a constant density core at the centre .",
    "the nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) is the result of an analytical fit to the dark matter density distribution that comes out of cosmological simulations performed within the frame of the ( @xmath28)cdm theory .",
    "the density distribution @xmath29 is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the characteristic density and scale of the nfw halo . a more useful pair of parameters can be found in the concentration parameter ( @xmath33 ) and the virial mass ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "cosmological simulations show that these two parameters are in fact correlated ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 , wechsler et al .",
    "2002 , neto et al .",
    "2007 ) , so that the following relations apply :    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the virial overdensity at @xmath39 ; it can be calculated following bryan & norman ( 1998 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation to the presence of dark matter in galaxies is mond . in mond",
    ", the true gravitational acceleration @xmath40 can be computed from the newtonian acceleration @xmath41 through the following relation :    @xmath42    where @xmath6 cm s@xmath7 ( begeman , broeils & sanders 1991 ) , and @xmath43 is the so - called interpolating function , whose asymptotic values are @xmath44 when @xmath45 and @xmath46 when @xmath47 .",
    "the exact functional form of @xmath43 is not defined by mond , and we adopt here the `` simple '' interpolating function ( famaey & binney 2005 , zhao & famaey 2006 ) :    @xmath48    which has been shown to yield more realistic fits than the `` standard '' @xmath43 ( sanders & noordermeer 2007 , famaey et al . 2007b , angus , famaey & diaferio 2010 ) , which has the following form :    @xmath49    because the estimates of the distance of ngc 1560 span a large range of values in the literature ( see section 1 ) , in the mond fits we decided to leave it as a free parameter , checking _ a posteriori _ the validity of the best - fit value .",
    "figures [ rcfit.bur]-[rcfit.1560.simple ] show the mass modelling results .",
    "the burkert halo gives a very good fit to the rotation curve ( @xmath50 ) , with a core radius of 5.6 kpc and a central density of 0.8@xmath5110@xmath52 g @xmath53 .",
    "however , because of the halo dominance already at small radii , it does not manage to explain the `` wiggle '' around 300@xmath14 : the total rotation curve that results from the mass modelling with a burkert halo is featureless , whereas the observed rotation curve is not .",
    "note , however , that the best - fit curve goes through the ( conservative ) errorbars in the region of the wiggle .",
    "the best - fit stellar @xmath23 ratio is 2.3 , at the high end of the allowed range ( see section [ sect_vis ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , modelling the rotation curve using the halo predicted in @xmath28cdm simulations results in a bad quality fit ( fig .",
    "[ rcfit.nfw ] ) . the best - fit virial mass is ( @xmath54)@xmath5110@xmath55 m@xmath56 ( the concentration is derived through eq .",
    "[ cmvir ] ) , which is consistent with studies linking the stellar and dark halo masses ( e.g. shankar et al .",
    "2006 , guo et al .",
    "2010 ) . as in numerous galaxy rotation curves ,",
    "the observed shape of the rotation curve is very different from the one predicted using an nfw halo , in particular in the innermost parts .",
    "the best - fit stellar @xmath23 ratio is 0.9 , which is at the lower extreme of the range of @xmath23 we considered .",
    "the quality of the nfw can improve if we take both the concentration and the virial mass as free parameters .",
    "however , the price to pay is to have a best - fit virial mass of 3.0 @xmath51 10@xmath57 m@xmath16 , which is much too high for a galaxy with a stellar mass around 5@xmath58 m@xmath16 ( shankar et al .",
    "2006 , guo et al .",
    "2010 ) , and to have a best - fit concentration parameter of 6.1 , which is 2 @xmath59 to 2.5 @xmath59 below the scatter in the virial mass - concentration relation ( eq .",
    "[ cmvir ] ) found in @xmath28cdm simulations ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 , neto et al .",
    "2007 ) .    the so - called einasto halo ( einasto 1965 , navarro et al . 2004 ,",
    "navarro et al . 2009 ) , which is a functional form that gives a slightly better description of the density distribution simulated halos than the nfw formula , was not used here .",
    "the reason is that within the radial range probed by our data ( 0.02@xmath60 to 0.73@xmath60 , where @xmath60=2.16@xmath32 and @xmath32 is derived from the best - fit @xmath34 ( with the concentration fixed ) and eqs .",
    "[ cmvir]-[cmvir2 ] ) , following navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2009 ) we find that the velocity difference between the two profiles is @xmath61dex , and it would make the velocity in the innermost parts higher , so the agreement with the data would be even _",
    "worse_.    mond fits the rotation curve very well ; we recall that we use the simple interpolating function ( eq . [ mond_simple ] ) . formally , the reduced @xmath62 value ( 0.56 ) is a little higher than the burkert halo fits , but because the `` wiggle '' around 300@xmath14 appears both in the total rotation curve and in @xmath18 , the mond fit reproduces reasonably well the wiggle .",
    "the best - fit stellar @xmath63 lies within the range derived from stellar population synthesis .",
    "the best - fit distance ( 2.94 mpc ) is a little bit low compared with the value given in karachentsev et al . (",
    "2003 ) , i.e. 3.45 mpc . however , the quality of the fit only slightly decreases ( reduced @xmath62=0.69 ) if we force the distance to stay within the range allowed by karachentsev et al .",
    "also , we note that there are also lower estimates of ngc 1560 s distance , e.g. lee & madore ( 1993 ) , who give 2.5 mpc using the brightest stars method . using the standard interpolating function ( eq . [ mond_std ] )",
    "gives a slightly higher best - fit distance ( 3.16 mpc ) and stellar @xmath23 ratio ( 1.09 ) , for an equivalently good fit ( @xmath62=0.54 , not shown here ) .",
    "it has been noted in the past ( e.g. bosma 1999 ) that there are cases where wiggles are linked to non - circular motions due to spiral arms .",
    "obviously , this effect is much more prominent in long - slit data than in two - dimensional velocity fields .",
    "bosma mentions visser ( 1980 ) , where in m81 strong non - circular motions in a 2-d velocity field still have a ( small ) effect on the rotation curve .",
    "however , in the case of ngc 1560 there are non - prominent spiral arms , so we expect the effect on the rotation curve to be very small , certainly not as large as the observed wiggle .    at the radius of the wiggle ,",
    "the orbital frequency is @xmath6414 km s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 and the epicyclic frequency is @xmath6421 km s@xmath2 kpc@xmath2 , which means that the mass distribution has the time to react to the gravitational potential from one side of the galaxy to the other , but only barely .",
    "hence , it is interesting ( though not formally completely correct , the construction of a rigorous model goes beyond the scope of this paper ) to make mass models of the two sides ( approaching and receding ) of the galaxy independently , as if the two sides were separate and in independent circular motion .",
    "we kept the distance fixed at 2.94 mpc , the best - fit distance in the total mond fit .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ combined_separately_standard ] , where one can notice that the observed kinematics follows the distribution of baryons , even when the two sides are considered separately : in the receding ( northern ) side of the galaxy , the wiggle in the baryons distribution is much more pronounced , and this is reflected in the observed kinematics of that side of the galaxy .                . ]    . ]",
    "ngc 1560 is a nearby dwarf sd galaxy , whose rotation curve has a very distinct `` wiggle '' .",
    "we observed ngc 1560 in hi with the gmrt , achieving a two times better resolution than the previous data of broeils ( 1992 ) , which were obtained with the wsrt .",
    "we re - derived the rotation curve of ngc 1560 by taking projection effects into account ( because of its high inclination angle , @xmath65 ) , and checked the reliability of our findings by creating model datacubes , which were compared to the observations .",
    "the new rotation curves is similar to the one derived by broeils ( 1992 ) , the main differences being in the innermost @xmath0 : at those radii we find slightly ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) higher velocities than broeils ( 1992 ) . also , we confirm the presence of a `` wiggle '' in the rotation curve , at around 300@xmath14 .",
    "the rotation curve was then corrected for asymmetric drift and used as input for mass modelling .",
    "the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve was derived from nir ( i - band ) data .",
    "the core - dominated burkert halo gives a good fit to the observed rotation curve , but it does not manage to explain the wiggle .",
    "the nfw halo gives a bad fit , greatly overpredicting the velocity in the innermost regions and slightly underpredicting the outermost ones ; using an einasto halo would only slightly change the fits , making them marginally even worse .",

    "<S> we present hi observations performed at the gmrt of the nearby dwarf galaxy ngc 1560 . </S>",
    "<S> this sd galaxy is well - known for a distinct `` wiggle '' in its rotation curve . </S>",
    "<S> our new observations have twice the resolution of the previously published hi data . </S>",
    "<S> we derived the rotation curve by taking projection effects into account , and we verified the derived kinematics by creating model datacubes . </S>",
    "<S> this new rotation curve is similar to the previously published one : we confirm the presence of a clear wiggle . </S>",
    "<S> the main differences are in the innermost @xmath0 of the rotation curve , where we find slightly ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) higher velocities . </S>",
    "<S> mass modelling of the rotation curve results in good fits using the core - dominated burkert halo ( which however does not reproduce the wiggle ) , bad fits using the a navarro , frenk & white halo , and good fits using mond ( modified newtonian dynamics ) , which also reproduces the wiggle .    </S>",
