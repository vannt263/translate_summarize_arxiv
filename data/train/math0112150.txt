    "the proof is mainly combinatorial ; the only non - combinatorial aspects are a small amount of equivariant cohomology theory and the pieri rule @xmath3 ( for completeness , we include a combinatorial proof of the pieri rule in an appendix . ) in particular , we avoid any use of the littlewood - richardson rule .",
    "in the course of our argument we also give a formula for equivariant schubert calculus on grassmannians , that is manifestly positive in the sense of @xcite ( which shall be defined in a moment ) ; to our knowledge this is the first such formula .",

    "this follows from the two lemmata just proven : @xmath387 @xmath388      equation is equivalent to @xmath389 this shall be an immediate consequence of    [ prop : gashprop ] there exists a weight - preserving bijection @xmath345 from @xmath390 to @xmath391 .",
    "let @xmath335 be an element of @xmath392 .",
    "we shall construct an element @xmath393 of @xmath391 for which @xmath394 .",
    "this will require only a local surgery on @xmath47 , in which some pieces are replaced and the gash moves .",
    "suppose first that @xmath336 is a sw - ne gash , and consider the pieces to its right , with a vertex on the center of the gash .",
    "since @xmath395 , there can not be an equivariant piece immediately to the right of @xmath336 , which leaves three possibilities : + .05 in    in each of these cases , we remove the pieces and gash , and replace them as follows : + .05 in    in each case , the labels on the _ boundary _ do not change , which means that the new set of pieces and gash match fit into the puzzle where the old ones were .",
    "so this creates a new gashed puzzle @xmath396 , and this is how we define @xmath397 .",
    "now take the case that @xmath336 is an e - w gash .",
    "since @xmath398 we see that @xmath336 is not on the @xmath399 edge of the puzzle .",
    "suppose first that @xmath336 has length 2 , and consider the pieces below @xmath336 with a vertex on the center of the gash .",
    "there are four possibilities , which we give below , along with their replacements in @xmath400 : + .05 in    now suppose that @xmath336 has length @xmath401",
    ". then the two extreme edges of @xmath336 are separated by @xmath402 equivariant pieces as shown below ( with @xmath403 ) : + .05 in    observe that between and below any two equivariant pieces on the gash there must be another equivariant piece ( since nothing else can fit in that space ) . that leaves @xmath404 possibilities for the ends , depending on whether there are more equivariant pieces in that row below .",
    "in each case we move the gash down one step , possibly stretching it or shrinking it by length 1 : + .05 in    ( in these pictures the gash begins length 4 , and ends length 5 , 4 , 4 , or 3 . )",
    "this creates a new gashed puzzle @xmath396 , with which we define @xmath397 .",
    "we have now defined @xmath405 for all @xmath406 .",
    "a simple examination of all cases verifies that @xmath396 is a gashed puzzle with @xmath407 , and also @xmath408 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath394 since no equivariant pieces are created , destroyed , or moved .",
    "if we rotate these local - replacement recipes by @xmath378 , we get a similar map @xmath409 from @xmath410 to @xmath411 .",
    "this is easily checked to be the inverse of @xmath345 , which is therefore a bijection .",
    "one can use the same rules to define a correspondence between @xmath354 and @xmath357 , but they must be iterated .",
    "this was the viewpoint of the examples in figures [ fig : crecex1 ] and [ fig : crecex2 ] at the beginning of the section .",
    "combining , , , , we obtain @xmath412 @xmath413 and this is .",
    "then by lemma [ lem : just1and3 ] and proposition [ prop : unique ] , we obtain the first statement of theorem [ thm : eqvtpuzcount ] .",
    "there is one foolish subtlety in obtaining the second statement of the theorem : the first statement ( and the recurrences - ) only constrain @xmath414 for @xmath59 all having the same number of @xmath46s , and so a priori we might worry that the product @xmath230 might be miscalculated to have some extra terms in which @xmath52 has a different number of @xmath46s .",
    "but by corollary [ cor : fixedk ] above , the number of @xmath46s is the same on all sides of a puzzle .",
    "the second statement follows .",
    "in this section we compare the results of this paper with the earlier work in @xcite , which was a major source of inspiration for this paper .",
    "we also give a homological ( or `` geometrical '' ) interpretation of the structure constants computed in @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite is concerned with multiplying `` factorial schur functions '' @xmath415 for @xmath17 .",
    "these functions are polynomials in two sets of variables @xmath416 , and are related to the classes @xmath85 by    @xcite , @xcite for any @xmath269 we have @xmath417 where @xmath418 and @xmath419 are the @xmath8 integers @xmath420 in decreasing order .",
    "it is easy to check the gkm conditions , and these @xmath421 have the right vanishing and normalization conditions ( as proved in @xcite and repeated in @xcite ) . then apply lemma [ lem : uniq ] .",
    "the problem solved in @xcite is more general than the one we have stated : they consider the mixed structure constants @xmath422 , which are polynomials in variables @xmath423 and @xmath424 , given by the product expansion @xmath425 the @xmath426 reduce to the structure constants for equivariant cohomology of grassmannians at the specialization @xmath427 ( and to ordinary cohomology at @xmath428 ) . to be a _",
    "skew _ schur function , not just a schur function , but we have not been able to find any cohomological interpretation of these . ]    the formula in @xcite writes @xmath429 as a sum over `` barred tableaux , '' each one contributing a certain product @xmath430 . in",
    "that sense their formula is positive ( and reduces to the littlewood - richardson rule , in the case that @xmath431 ) . unfortunately , many of their terms have @xmath432 factors with @xmath433 , as the example @xmath434 already shows .",
    "for this reason , the computation of molev - sagan structure constants is too general a setting for finding a formula ( as in theorem [ thm : eqvtpuzcount ] ) for equivariant schubert calculus that is manifestly positive in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we now give a cohomological interpretation of the structure constants @xmath426 , which we christen `` triple schubert calculus '' , and sketch how one can also compute these co - efficients using `` ms - puzzles '' .",
    "( cohomology does not explicitly appear in @xcite  they consider the computation of the @xmath435 purely as a combinatorial question . )      in this subsection we recall the ( well - known ) connection between double schubert calculus and equivariant schubert calculus . in a nutshell ,",
    "the connection is that @xmath436 for any partial flag manifold @xmath154 , taking equivariant schubert classes to `` double schubert classes '' .",
    "we begin by recalling some standard material on double schubert calculus ( originally defined in @xcite ) , and its geometric interpretation .",
    "let @xmath437 denote the space of flags ( i.e. maximal chains of subspaces ) in @xmath29 .",
    "this has a transitive action of @xmath2 induced from its action on @xmath29 , and the stabilizer of the standard flag @xmath67 is the upper triangular matrices @xmath438 , so @xmath439 .",
    "if we denote the lower triangular matrices by @xmath440 , then the schubert cells @xmath30 on the grassmannian @xmath0 are exactly the @xmath440 orbits , whose poincar duals gave us the schubert basis @xmath36 of ordinary cohomology @xmath4 .",
    "these were indexed by patterns @xmath27 recording the intersection of the @xmath8-plane with the anti - standard flag .",
    "analogously , we can consider closures of the @xmath2-orbits on @xmath441 , which are again indexed by @xmath6 ( recording the intersection of the @xmath8-plane with the flag , which is now varying ) .",
    "the poincar duals @xmath442 of these @xmath2-orbit closures then form an @xmath443-basis for @xmath444 as @xmath18 varies over @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath444 is a ring as well as an @xmath443-module , we can define structure constants @xmath445 for the multiplication : @xmath446 the computation of the @xmath447 is the concern of * * double schubert calculus , and has the following homological interpretation .",
    "fix a generic element @xmath336 of @xmath2 .",
    "the class @xmath448 corresponds to an irreducible cycle of pairs @xmath449 where @xmath450 satisfies two intersection conditions with @xmath451 : @xmath450 intersects @xmath451 @xmath18-much , and intersects @xmath452 @xmath51-much .",
    "the class @xmath453 corresponds to a union of cycles , each of which put only one condition on @xmath450 ( that it intersect @xmath451 @xmath52-much ) , while also requiring that @xmath451 live in a cycle poincar dual to @xmath454 .",
    "so the equation requiring these two to be homologous is somehow splitting the double burden on @xmath450 to a single burden on @xmath450 and a single burden on @xmath451 .    restricting @xmath441 to @xmath455 , each @xmath456 maps to @xmath36 , which shows that these @xmath454 generalize the structure constants @xmath259 of ordinary schubert calculus .",
    "this was also true of the structure constants of equivariant schubert calculus , and like them , the @xmath447 carry a degree . rather than @xmath223 . ]",
    "we can connect double schubert calculus with equivariant schubert calculus using the following property of equivariant cohomology : if @xmath457 acts on @xmath154 , and @xmath458 s action is free , then @xmath459 . letting @xmath47",
    "denote the stabilizer of the standard @xmath8-plane @xmath460 , so @xmath461 , we thus have @xmath462 @xmath463 @xmath464 where we have used the fact that @xmath2 is isomorphic to @xmath465 quotiented by the diagonal action of @xmath2 .",
    "thus the structure constants @xmath259 for equivariant schubert calculus live in @xmath466 , and the forgetful map from @xmath467 to @xmath443 maps these constants to the double schubert calculus constants @xmath447 .    to summarize the above discussion , while equivariant schubert calculus essentially lacks a definition in terms of intersecting cycles , one is provided by double schubert calculus , of which",
    "equivariant schubert calculus is a refinement .. this is perhaps a bad way to see things , though , since such a limit can only be defined for classical lie groups , whereas double and equivariant schubert calculus can be defined for arbitary lie groups . ]",
    "consider the cohomology ring @xmath468 as a module over the cohomology ring @xmath469 of the first and third factors .",
    "since the classes @xmath470 form a basis of @xmath444 , we see that the classes @xmath471 form a @xmath472-basis for @xmath473 .",
    "one could compute the structure constants for multiplication in this basis , but one would just obtain the double schubert constants @xmath447 again ( or to be pedantic , we would obtain @xmath474 ) .    since @xmath475 , the classes @xmath470 induce a corresponding basis @xmath476 for @xmath477 .",
    "the classes @xmath478 thus form another @xmath472-basis for @xmath479 .",
    "again , the structure constants for this basis are no richer than for double schubert calculus .    in @xcite the authors ( implicitly ) considered the hybrid problem of computing the structure constants @xmath480 in the expansion @xmath481 this has the following homological interpretation .",
    "we are now looking for triples @xmath482 .",
    "the left side of the equation says that @xmath450 intersects @xmath483 @xmath51-much and also intersects @xmath484 @xmath485-much .",
    "the right side is a union of cycles , in each of which @xmath450 intersects @xmath483 @xmath52-much , has _ no _ condition directly relating @xmath450 to @xmath484 , and instead @xmath483 and @xmath484 are related by a condition poincar dual to @xmath486 .",
    "again , the equation is shifting the double burden on @xmath450 to a single burden on @xmath450 and a single burden on the pair @xmath487 .    in analogy with double schubert calculus",
    "we feel it is appropriate to dub the computation of the @xmath488 * * triple schubert calculus .",
    "note that these @xmath316 s are _ not _ symmetric in @xmath485 and @xmath51 , and only become so when restricted to the flag manifold sitting diagonally in the first and third factor .",
    "it is worth noting that triple schubert calculus has many extensions ",
    "e.g. @xmath458-theory , replacing the grassmannian by a flag manifold , or using groups other than @xmath2 . ; in @xcite",
    "the roots @xmath489 of @xmath2 are implicitly seen as a specialization of @xmath490 , and it is unclear how to extend this to arbitrary root systems .",
    "for many of the other extensions , no satisfactory explicit combinatorial formula for the structure constants is known . ] in this way , one can view @xcite as establishing a positivity result for triple schubert calculus on grassmannians .      for completeness",
    ", we use the connection between double schubert calculus and equivariant schubert calculus discussed in subsection [ double - eqvt - sec ] to recast triple schubert calculus as `` equivariant double schubert calculus '' .",
    "inside @xmath441 , we have two interesting families of subvarieties parameterized by @xmath15 : the diagonal-@xmath2 orbit closures , and the varieties @xmath491 corresponding to the schubert cycles @xmath30 .",
    "both families are invariant under the diagonal action of the torus , and so define families of equivariant cohomology classes @xmath492 in @xmath493 .",
    "either family gives a @xmath494-basis of @xmath493 .",
    "therefore we can expand the product @xmath495 where the coefficients @xmath496 live in @xmath494 . following a similar analysis as in subsection [ double - eqvt - sec ]",
    "one can show that these coefficients @xmath497 refine the coefficients @xmath488 in triple schubert calculus .",
    "the results of @xcite have the rather surprising consequence that the constants @xmath488 and @xmath498 can be lifted beyond their respective rings @xmath499 and @xmath494 to actual double polynomials @xmath500 ; this would suggest ( speaking loosely ) that one should be able to replace the cohomology ring @xmath493 with the `` doubly equivariant '' ring @xmath501 ( using an ineffective action of @xmath502 on @xmath0 ) .",
    "while this can indeed be done , the homological perspective is lost , because the classes being multiplied are no longer representable by subvarieties .",
    "define an * * ms - puzzle as an arrangement of puzzle pieces forming a _ diamond _ of size @xmath43 , looking something like a very large equivariant piece .",
    "they therefore have the usual nw and ne boundaries , and now sw and se boundaries as well .",
    "we will require the labels on the ne boundary ( read clockwise ) to be the inversion - free string @xmath503 .",
    "some examples are in figure [ fig : msexample ] .    define the * * ms - weight of an equivariant piece as @xmath504 , where @xmath33 measures the distance from the se side and @xmath96 from the sw side for @xmath33 the distance from the sw side and @xmath96 the distance from the nw side . ] ( starting from 1 ) , and the * * weight of an ms - puzzle as the product of the ms - weights of its equivariant pieces .",
    "the molev - sagan structure constant @xmath505 is equal to the sum of the weights of the ms - puzzles with @xmath485 on the sw side , @xmath51 on the nw side , and @xmath52 on the se side , all read bottom - to - top .",
    "( the ne side has all @xmath45s , then all @xmath46s , read clockwise . )",
    "we will not prove the theorem here , except to say that the molev - sagan structure constants satisfy a recurrence similar to that in corollary [ cor : crecurrence ] , and the ms - puzzle formula can be shown to satisfy this recurrence through a slight variant of the arguments in section [ sec : cscab ] .",
    "of course , similar recurrences were proven in @xcite using barred tableaux .",
    "it is possible , though quite unpleasant , to establish a weight - preserving bijection between ms - puzzles and molev - sagan barred tableaux , but we will not present one here .",
    "an example of ms - puzzles in action is in figure [ fig : msexample ] , demonstrating the equality @xmath506    it is interesting to compare this calculation to that of @xmath507 using ( non - ms ) puzzles , as done in figure [ fig : non - msexample ] , which only uses three puzzles .",
    "the fact that equivariant schubert calculus and molev - sagan structure constants both reduce to ordinary schubert calculus , in the case @xmath226 , is reflected in the fact that the two ordinary puzzles in the second calculation occur as the lower halves of the corresponding ms - puzzles ( rotated @xmath508 ) .",

    "if @xmath116 is a class , define @xmath515 by @xmath516 a priori , this is just a list of rational functions .",
    "but in fact these @xmath514 turn out to define endomorphisms of @xmath82 ( as a vector space ) :      from the gkm conditions we see that @xmath517 .",
    "we want to know that @xmath515 itself satisfies the gkm conditions , i.e. that @xmath518 is a multiple of @xmath519 if @xmath520 differ in only the @xmath521 positions .",
    "plainly this is true if @xmath522 , @xmath523 ( or vice versa ) since then the difference is zero . otherwise , the division by @xmath524 is irrelevant since its gcd with @xmath519 is one , and then the divisibility follows from the fact that @xmath116 and @xmath525 are both classes",
