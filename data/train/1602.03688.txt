    "one of the proposed explanation of the red asymmetry is that the broad emission line gas is gravitationally dominated by the central black hole . in this regard ,",

    "@xcite gave the quantitative test if the gravitational redshift ( @xmath3 ) model is possible , by calculating the mass of the central source , and found that the mass corresponding to the shift @xmath40.001 should yield to the mass of around @xmath5 .",

    "we then matched simulated relativistic emission line profiles obtained by ray tracing method with the optical emission h@xmath10 line profiles from he sample , for the cases where centroids of line widths measured on 1/4 of maximum line intensity were significantly shifted to the red , in order to see if their shapes could be distorted by gravitational redshift .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 an overview on the gravitational redshift hypothesis is presented .",
    "implications of gravitational redshift in the case of weak gravitational field are analyzed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we consider the possibility that the gravitational redshift shapes the red wing of h@xmath10 profile .",
    "section 5 gives our conclusions on the gravitational redshift search in optical agn spectra .",
    "the concept that gravitational redshift may influence quasar optical emission lines causing line asymmetries was proposed by @xcite .",
    "there were some earlier attempts to consider gravitational redshift as an explanation for the cosmological redshift of quasars but this led to a series of inconsistencies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the systematic gravitational redshift may have a non - negligible effect on the shape of spectral lines , when the emission region is in the gravitational field of a massive black hole ( @xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "this leads to an asymmetric and redshifted profile of emission lines , especially in broad lines ( bl ) or their very broad line ( vbl ) base that originate at distances of only few light days from the central black hole @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite suggested gravitational redshift as an explanation for the red shifted very broad wings in the optical emission line profiles in order to explain the redward asymmetric broad h@xmath10 profile of arakelian 120 , under the assumption of very compact broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "this effect was more systematically investigated by @xcite and @xcite who assumed a single component model of the broad line region , and by @xcite who assumed a two component model , a very broad line region ( vblr , where profile bases are formed ) and an intermediate line region ( ilr , forming the profile cores ) for the blr .",
    "@xcite studied relativistic effects on the emission from the blr assuming orbits for the emitting clouds in a schwarzschild geometry , and proposed a model for the blr in which he distinguished two emitting regions , the ilr and the vblr , taking into account the relativistic effects on the emission line profiles . in that paper",
    "he suggested that redward profile asymmetries can be produced by the effect of gravitational redshift on the emission from the vblr , when the vblr is represented by a flattened ensemble of clouds viewed nearly face - on , at a mean distance of few tens of gravitational radii from the black hole .",
    "the redshift of the ilr component could be as well explained with the same geometry of a flattened ensemble of clouds lying on a distance of several hundreds gravitational radii from the central black hole .",
    "+ @xcite found that the red asymmetry of h@xmath10 line increases with the increasing soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "this correlation may be interpreted as a progressive redshift of the very broad line region velocity centroid ( @xmath12 5000 - 20000 ) with respect to the systemic velocity with increasing x - ray luminosity .",
    "also , @xcite noticed that , on average , radio - loud ( rl ) objects show stronger redward asymmetric profiles than radio - quiet ( rq ) object of comparable optical luminosity . under the gravitational redshift hypothesis ,",
    "these differences could be explained as the larger masses of the black hole and the host galaxy for rl objects .",
    "this is consistent with the evidence that they are merger products @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation may not be correct because rq in the same black hole mass domain are also found @xcite .",
    "+ since the variable part of the spectral line originates far more closely to the central nuclei than the constant line components , @xcite and @xcite assumed that the gravitational redshift effect might be present in this variable component .",
    "therefore , they used the rms profile of the spectra from the monitoring campaign of ngc5548 @xcite , ngc4593 @xcite and mrk 110 @xcite , measured the shift between the rms profile and the mean profile , and identified the differential shift as gravitational redshift .",

    ", h@xmath10 , hei@xmath25876 and heii@xmath24686 and found the strongest @xmath3 in the heii@xmath24686 , as it originates closest to the black hole .",
    "the confirmation that the optical emission lines in mrk 110 are gravitationally affected was given by @xcite , where emission lines are modeled under the assumption that they originate in the vicinity of a black hole . +      if line redshift with respect to rest frame and redward line asymmetries are indeed of gravitational origin , it would be possible to derive parameters that are important in studies of agn spectra , such as :    * _ the smbh mass , with an orientation - independent estimate _ - knowing the gravitational redshift @xmath14 , one can estimate an upper limit of the central mass as @xmath15 @xcite . this way of estimating the smbh mass is independent of the geometry and inclination of the object , but still requires the knowledge of the emitting region radius ( r ) .",
    "other methods for mass estimations that assume the virial motion of the gas , such as @xmath16 @xcite , include the dimensionless factor @xmath17 that depends , among other things , on the geometry and orientation of the blr .",
    "* _ the inclination angle of the accretion disk _ - in the case of mrk 110 , @xcite assumed the accretion disk model of the blr . under this assumption ,",
    "the comparison between @xmath18 and @xmath19 give an estimation of the orientation angle @xmath20 of the accretion disk : @xmath19/@xmath18=@xmath21 .",
    "therefore , this method makes it possible to estimate the inclination angle of the accretion disk for radio - quiet agns . until now",
    ", the inclination angle has been estimated only for a relatively small number of radio - loud sources in which superluminal motion has been detected @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the new method for the estimations of the inclination of the broad emission line region ( blr ) , based on the observations in a polarised light , under the assumption of a flattened configuration of blr , but this interesting method has been tentatively applied until now only to a few tens of seyfert nuclei . +",
    "* _ spin orientation of the supermassive black hole _ - @xcite went one step further in the interpretation of the inclination angle . from the cross - correlation analysis he determined the distances of the line emitting regions , using the rms profile .",
    "he found that the variable heii@xmath22 line component originates at a mean distance of 3.9 light days , that mean 230 schwarzschild radii only .",
    "therefore , he suggested that the orientation axis of the inner accretion disk is oriented parallel to the spin axis of the central black hole .",
    "however , the nature of the systematic line shift still remains an open question , since shifts in both directions - redward , but also blueward are observed .",
    "redshifts of h@xmath10 are observed more frequently than blueshifts , and that could indicate a systematic trend that may not be immediately explainable by doppler effect assuming plausible kinematic scenarios .",

    "if there is indeed enough gas to sustain power law emissivity ( with @xmath69 between @xmath0 -2.2 and @xmath0 -2.6 ) , gravitational redshift could be estimated from the line centroid , and in this way @xmath14 could be used as a proxy for m@xmath71 calculation .",
