    "<S> in metals near a quantum critical point , the electrical resistance is thought to be determined by the lifetime of the carriers of current , rather than the scattering from defects . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of @xmath0-linear resistivity suggests that the lifetime only depends on temperature , implying the vanishing of an intrinsic energy scale and the presence of a quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> our data suggest that this concept extends to the magnetic field dependence of the resistivity in the unconventional superconductor bafe@xmath1(as@xmath2p@xmath3)@xmath1 near its quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lifetime depends on magnetic field in the same way as it depends on temperature , scaled by the ratio of two fundamental constants @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements imply that high magnetic fields probe the same quantum dynamics that give rise to the @xmath0-linear resistivity , revealing a novel kind of magnetoresistance that does not depend on details of the fermi surface , but rather on the balance of thermal and magnetic energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> this opens new opportunities for the investigation of transport near a quantum critical point by using magnetic fields to couple selectively to charge , spin and spatial anisotropies .    </S>",
    "<S> the conventional description of metals depends on the existence of a robust fermi surface in momentum space , a locus of free - electron - like quasiparticles that determine most properties of a metal , including the ability to pass electric current@xcite . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> , the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle scattering rate ( @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fermi energy ) arises from rare quasiparticle decay events and provides a weak addition to the elastic scattering . however , many correlated electron metals , particularly those thought to be near a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , display a striking @xmath0-linear dependence of the electrical resistivity @xcite . assuming that it is the scattering rate that is responsible for all the temperature dependence of resistivity , these experimental observations suggest a linear temperature dependence of the quasiparticle scattering rate , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 close to unity across a broad range of materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the physical mechanism behind this is not fully understood @xcite , it is argued that because temperature is the dominant energy scale in the system , @xmath0 sets the scattering rate near a qcp , resulting in the observed @xmath0-linear resistivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since this argument only depends on temperature s being the dominant energy scale , it raises the question of whether the same intuition can be extended to magneto - transport phenomena in quantum critical systems , with the magnetic field playing the role of temperature .    in conventional metals </S>",
    "<S> the effect of a magnetic field on the quasiparticle scattering rate is negligible ; the magnetoresistance arises from quasiparticles traversing the fermi surface in cyclotron orbits under the influence of the lorentz force . </S>",
    "<S> the field dependence of the resistance ( mr ) therefore is a sensitive function of the morphology of the fs , the curvature of which causes a suppression of the average velocity in the direction of the current @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering time only affects the mr by limiting the path length of a cyclotron orbit , which in turn leads to kohler s rule scaling  @xcite . even in models of mr near a qcp </S>",
    "<S> , the morphology of the fermi surface generally plays a crucial role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we hypothesize that in quantum critical metals the magnetic field can set the energy scale of the scattering rate in the same way as temperature , such that @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this would result in @xmath10-linear mr and could provide a natural explanation for the @xmath10-linear mr that has been observed in many correlated metals thought to be near a qcp @xcite .     and @xmath11 in . * </S>",
    "<S> * a. * the temperature dependence of the normalized resistivity @xmath12 is @xmath0-linear at high-@xmath0 , which appears as sub - linear behavior in * c * when plotted against @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> * b. * the mr qualitatively looks @xmath10-linear at high-@xmath10 , particularly at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity with the resistance as a function of temperature is striking when plotted against @xmath14 , as can be seen by comparing * c & d. * the mr curves were taken at temperatures 4k , 14k , 25k , 31k , 38k and 60k.,width=264 ]    the unconventional superconductor is a system that is known to show @xmath0-linear resistivity in a broad range of temperature and composition @xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parent compound , bafe@xmath1as@xmath1 , is a tetragonal paramagnet at high temperatures , transitioning to an orthorhombic antiferromagnet at around 140k@xcite . with the substitution of p for as the magnetic transition temperature </S>",
    "<S> is suppressed , heading towards zero temperature at around @xmath16 ( the doping at which there is thought to be a quantum critical point @xcite ) , where the superconducting @xmath17 reaches a maximum of @xmath1830  k. these materials are perhaps the cleanest of the doped fe - pnictide systems , showing quantum oscillations at compositions @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are therefore an ideal material family in which to study magnetoresistance of a metal near a quantum critical point .        </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the in - plane mr of up to 65 tesla , with the field applied parallel to the crystallographic @xmath20-axis . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : tsqbsq ] ( a ) shows the normalized resistivity @xmath21 as a function of temperature for a sample ( x = 0.31 ) that is near the putative critical point and is strongly t - linear at high temperature . the small amount of curvature at lower temperatures should not affect our analysis since we are interested in high field and high temperature effects.@xcite . figure [ fig : tsqbsq ] ( b ) shows the mr , which exhibits an analogous high field @xmath10-linear dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity between the transport as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath10 is even more striking when the data is plotted as @xmath13 and @xmath14 on similar vertical scales , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tsqbsq ] ( c ) and ( d ) . </S>",
    "<S> ideally we would measure the mr of the normal state over a wide range of magnetic field at zero ( or at least very low ) temperature but superconductivity cuts off the data below the upper critical field @xmath22 , restricting us to a narrow range of the high magnetic field region where @xmath10-squared and @xmath10-linear behaviors are difficult to distinguish . </S>",
    "<S> however , we observe that the mr qualitatively appears more @xmath10-linear at low temperature and more @xmath10-squared at high temperature ( a fact that is widely known in these and other unconventional superconductors @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us an important clue as to how magnetic field and temperature influence transport - they appear to compete to set the scale of the scattering .    to analyze the form of this competition </S>",
    "<S> , we look for scaling behavior of the mr as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath0 by plotting @xmath23 versus @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> note that we remove the residual resistivity @xmath25 so that only the temperature dependent part of the resistivity enters the analysis ( see supplementary information for details on the determination of @xmath25 ) . when plotted this way </S>",
    "<S> , the data appear to collapse to a single curve that is well described by a hyperbolic function of @xmath24 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : scaling ] a. we therefore formulate the following ansatz @xmath26 where @xmath8 and @xmath27 relate the scattering rate directly to the temperature and magnetic field scales respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar ansatz has been used to describe the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity in uru@xmath1si@xmath1 @xcite , the magnetic susceptibility of cecu@xmath28au@xmath29 @xcite and the magnetic fluctuations of la@xmath30sr@xmath31cuo@xmath32 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this expression naturally captures the limiting cases of high field and high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath33 the scattering rate will be @xmath0-linear , and vice versa . between these two limits magnetic field and temperature compete to set the scale of the scattering .        in order to understand the degree to which magnetic field and temperature each influence the scattering , it is necessary to determine the scale factor , @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the variable @xmath8 can be determined by the slope of the resistance versus temperature at zero field . however , because there is a cross over from @xmath0-linear to @xmath0-squared behavior as temperature is lowered , we use the high-@xmath0 limit of the resistivity data to determine @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we look at the high-@xmath10 limit to determine @xmath27 , choosing the lowest temperature curve so that magnetic field is certain to be the dominant energy scale . comparing the slope of resistance versus @xmath0 and @xmath10 in these regions , we find that @xmath35 ( see supplementary information for details ) . with the value of the scale factor @xmath36 determined , we can plot all of the mr data , together with the zero field resistance , as a function of @xmath37 ( fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : scaling ] ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that for any combination of field and temperature , the resistance always approaches the same @xmath37-linear dependence , as described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : phenomenon ] . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this behavior holds for a range of dopings near the critical point ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : rvg2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not expected in a conventional metal , where the magnitude and form as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath10 will in general be unrelated , each depending on different details of the fermi surface .        at temperatures below @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> , we note a deviation from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : phenomenon ] . </S>",
    "<S> although we can not account for this in our ansatz , it seems likely that the deviation is due to the presence of other energy scales related to superconductivity . at compositions </S>",
    "<S> far from the qcp , we expect this behavior to break down completely as the materials crossover to conventional fermi liquids@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed observed , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : overdoped_rvg ] for compositions well beyond @xmath38 . a more detailed description of the relevance of eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : phenomenon ] as a function of @xmath15 will require a much more extensive study .     the magnetic field and temperature play identical roles in setting the energy scale of the scattering , such that they appear @xmath0-linear at small @xmath10 ( red region ) , and @xmath10-linear at small @xmath39 ( blue region ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data suggest that it is more useful to understand this physics as a balance of the two scales , which is phenomenologically captured by eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : phenomenon ] . </S>",
    "<S> , width=264 ]    high magnetic fields have played an important role in the study of qcps , both as a tuning parameter to drive systems toward a qcp @xcite and in suppressing competing ordered states to reveal a qcp @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the role of magnetic field is quite different ; our measurements suggest that @xmath10-linear resistivity has the same origin as @xmath0-linear resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a revision of the doping - temperature quantum critical phase diagram to include the role of an applied magnetic field , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . here </S>",
    "<S> the important role of the combined energy scale @xmath37 is immediately apparent : at comparable values of @xmath10 and @xmath0 the transport is linear in @xmath37 but not in @xmath10 or @xmath0 individually . </S>",
    "<S> viewed in this way , magnetic fields provide another probe of the anomalous dynamics that lead to t - linear resistivity , with the added benefit that , unlike temperature , an applied magnetic field couples selectively to charge , spin and material anisotropies , limiting the possible theoretical descriptions of this phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> it is striking that the scale factor @xmath36 connecting magnetic field and temperature energy scales is close to unity and does not appear to change in the doping range considered , which is surprising because the quasiparticle effective mass changes considerably in the same doping range  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that the magnetoresistance in originates from the direct effect of magnetic field on the quantum dynamics near its qcp , rather than the more conventional origin involving orbital motion about the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements may point to a universal theoretical description of the physics of metals near a qcp where the scattering rate depends on the intricate interplay of energy scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoresistance may therefore prove crucial in elucidating the quantum dynamics of other systems that are thought to have vanishing energy scales , including the cuprate superconductors and heavy fermion systems @xcite . </S>"
