    "on dimensional grounds this is reasonable , since @xmath134 is a velocity per round , which has units of length , and @xmath126 is dimensionless .",
    "we see that @xmath126 near 1 corresponds to the fisher limit , equivalent to the large @xmath146 limit of our model , since the growth rate of the population is @xmath147 , so that small @xmath147 corresponds to a large value of our dimensionless control parameter . on the other hand , for large @xmath126 , the models differ since the diffusion never goes away entirely in the everyone hops snyder model .",

    "@xmath158 ( color online ) ]    we see that the larger @xmath126 is , the larger the correction according to bd is , since as discussed above , increasing @xmath126 corresponds to decreasing the strength of diffusion in our model .",
    "in a previous work  @xcite , we studied the case of fronts propagating into an unstable state up a reaction - rate gradient .",
    "we focused again on the @xmath159 reaction  @xcite , with no @xmath8 particles and an initial mean number @xmath5 of b particles at all sites past some initial @xmath160 , but with a reaction probability that depended linearly on spatial position .",
    "this type of gradient would be a natural consequence of spatial inhomogeneity , or could be imposed via a temperature gradient in a chemical reaction analog .",
    "also , this type of system arises naturally in models of darwinian evolution  @xcite , ( where fitness @xmath17 is the independent variable ; the birth - rate , akin to the reaction - rate here , is proportional to fitness ) .",

    "we also introduced a _ quasi - static _ version of the model , wherein the reaction rate function moves along with the front : @xmath164 with @xmath165 is the instantaneous front position .",
    "this quasi - static problem should lead to a translation - invariant front with fixed speed @xmath166 .",
    "although important on its own , one might also try to view the quasi - static problem as a zeroth - order approximation to the original model , ( the _ absolute _ gradient case ) , where by ignoring the acceleration , one obtains an adiabatic approximation to the velocity @xmath167 with @xmath168 . in both models ,",
    "fluctuations become crucial due to the reaction gradient and the presence of the gradient leads to a new class of fronts .",
    "one characteristic of this new class is the divergence of the front velocity with @xmath5 .",

    "it should be noted that in both cases the leading order does not yield an accurate solution , and the next order correction must be taken into account .",
    "given that the nature of the divergence of the velocity with @xmath5 depends on the microscopic implementation of diffusion ( continuum versus lattice ) , it is natural to investigate this question for our model with exponentially distributed hopping .",
    "here , we chose to work on a lattice ( with spacing @xmath7 ) ; we will see in the end that the results here are not sensitive to the presence of the lattice .",

    "one can obtain that , for fixed @xmath190 , @xmath184 is only weakly dependent on @xmath7 for @xmath191 as long as @xmath35 is not too large , @xmath192 .",
    "for example , for @xmath94 , @xmath193 for @xmath194 and @xmath195 for @xmath196 .",

    "the faster the growth of @xmath197 , the weaker the dependence of the velocity on @xmath199 .",

    "( color online ) ]    as a closing remark , we note that one of the most interesting aspects of the above calculation ( and the previously published calculations for the nearest neighbor hopping model ) is that the result does not at all depend on form of the solution past the cutoff point ; the mere existence of a cutoff is enough to force the system to the wkb turning point and hence fix the velocity .",
    "we have investigated herein reaction - diffusion systems in which the hopping probability exponentially decays with distance , focussing on the fluctuation induced anomalies seen in the same systems with continuous diffusion and nearest neighbor hopping . as in these previously studied cases , we probe the sensitivity to fluctuations by studying the dependence of the steady - state velocity on a cutoff in the reaction term when the density drops below a cutoff of the order of one particle per site .",
    "we first studied this model with no gradient , showing that , in the absence of a cutoff , the velocity does not vanish for small @xmath16 .",
    "we showed that the bd correction for velocity due to the presence of a cutoff diverges in the case of small @xmath16 , and calculate that the velocity actually vanishes linearly for small @xmath16 in the presence of cutoff .",
    "our model is similar to a discrete - time model describing the spread of colonies , and we show the same generic features apply to this model as well .",
    "we then studied the effect of introducing a quasi - static gradient into our model . here , even for continuum diffusion and nearest - neighbor hoppings ,",
    "fluctuation effects lead to a divergence of the velocity with increasing particle density @xmath5 .",
    "we found that this phenomenon is enhanced by the exponential distributed hopping , so that the velocity diverges more strongly , as @xmath218 .",
    "in fact , for long - range hopping , @xmath251 , the velocity is proportional to @xmath252 .",
    "our analytical work was confirmed by direct simulation of the cutoff deterministic equation , as well as by comparison to the original stochastic model .",
    "in the body of the paper , we have presented results from direct numerical simulations of both the deterministic cutoff reaction - diffusion equation and the stochastic particle model . here",
    "we briefly present some relevant details of the simulation methods , especially in reference to treating in an efficient manner the long - range nature of the hopping .",
    "the simulations are essentially standard , using an euler method time step .",
    "the only subtlety is in handling the hopping term efficiently .",
    "a naive treatment would involve calculating the transfer of density from every pair of sites , which is a prohibitively expensive @xmath253 operation , where @xmath254 is the spatial extent of the lattice .    to solve this difficulty , consider the density transfered to site @xmath255 from all the sites to the left ; i.e. , @xmath256 .",
    "this transfered density , which we denote @xmath257 is given by @xmath258 @xmath257 satisfies a simple recursion relation : @xmath259 thus , in one pass we can calculate how much density is transferred to every site from all its left neighbors . the density transferred from the right neighbors",
    "is done similarly , using @xmath260 and the recursion relation @xmath261 and making a leftward pass over the sites .",
    "the problem is thus reduced to an @xmath262 problem .",
    "our basic technique for simulating the stochastic model is to treat all the particles on a given site in `` bulk ''  @xcite .",
    "the number of particles that participate in any given process ( birth , death and hopping ) is given by a binomial distribution , and so can be determined by drawing a binomial deviate .",
    "the simulation performs in parallel first a hopping step , followed by a reaction step . in the reaction step , the number of @xmath9 particles which transform into @xmath8 s at site @xmath17 is again a binomial deviate , drawn from @xmath263 . replacing the distribution by its expected value , and setting @xmath264 , and defining @xmath265 gives eq .",
    "( [ fisher ] ) .",
    "a @xmath266 small enough so that less than 10% of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 s at a site hop and/or react in one time step is sufficient ; smaller values do not alter the results .",
    "again , hopping in our model provides a challenge , since we can not afford to draw a binomial deviate for every pair of sites .",
    "rather , every time step we first determine the number of particles _ leaving _ that site due to the hopping , by drawing a single binomial deviate .",
    "we then determine how many of these move to the right , by drawing a second deviate .",
    "of those moving to the left ( right ) , we determine how many move to the nearest neighbor , by drawing a third deviate , and remove this number from the pool of left ( right ) movers .",
    "then , if any particles remain in the pool , we determine how many move to the second nearest neighbor , removing these from the pool , continuing in this manner till the pool is exhausted .",
    "the number of deviates we need to choose is thus fixed ( on average ) by @xmath185 , independent of @xmath254 ."
