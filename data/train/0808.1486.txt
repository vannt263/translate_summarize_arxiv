    "volume reflection of charged particles in single crystals represents the coherent scattering of these particles by planar or axial electric fields of bent crystallographic structures . for the first time",
    ", this effect was predicted in ref.@xcite on the basis of monte carlo calculations .",
    "recently in ref . @xcite an analytical description of volume reflection of ultrarelativistic particles was considered .",
    "besides , this process was observed and investigated in a number of experiments @xcite . results of study of volume reflection is interest to series of important applications for accelerator technics ( as beam collimation , extraction and others ) . for work of these applications",
    "is assumed to use many times repeated volume reflection process ( in special crystal structures ) .",
    "one can expect that due to a high efficiency of the process the sum efficiency of crystal devices will be also high enough .    the main process which influents on an efficiency of volume reflection is volume capture @xcite when moving in bent single crystals particles may be ( due to multiple scattering on atoms ) captured in a channeling regime .",
    "the analytical description of volume reflection ( see @xcite ) gives good predictions for many characteristic of the process , but volume capture was not considered in this theory .",
    "this paper is devoted to complete analytical consideration of volume reflection , including influence of volume capture on the process .",
    "main results of ref.@xcite remain valid but their simple modernization is required .",
    "no doubt that monte carlo simulations give detailed information about process at some specific initial conditions .",
    "however , an analytical description allows one to make observation of the problem as a whole .",
    "our experience @xcite shows that an accuracy of the analytical calculations of such parameters as a mean and mean square angles at volume reflection compares with the results of monte carlo simulations .",
    "besides , in ref .",
    "@xcite is shown how to use generalized parameters for description of the process .",
    "because of this , one can obtain set of results from one calculated result .",
    "it is important for emulation of the process , when the experimental results are known at some conditions ( for example , for one energy of beam ) and these results should be used at another conditions ( another energy ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe our method for study of diffusion processes in bent single crystals . than based on this method",
    "we find the probability of volume capture and energy distribution underbarrier particles .",
    "after that we investigate behavior of the channeling fraction at its propagation in single crystal . as result",
    "we get the analytical relations for distribution functions of particles .    in the second part",
    "we illustrate the obtained relations by numerical calculations and then we discuss and summarize presented in the paper results .",
    "let us consider motion of the charged ultrarelativistic particle in bent single crystal . in the absence of multiple scattering",
    "we can write the following equation @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the particle energy , @xmath2 is the transversal energy , u(x ) is the periodic interplanar potential as a function of the transversal coordinate @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the bending radius of a single crystal , @xmath5 is the particle velocity divided on the velocity of light @xmath6 .    obviously , this equation reflects the conservation of the transversal energy .",
    "introduction of multiple scattering violates this condition .",
    "let us suppose that the moving in bent crystal one separate particle is scattered on the angle @xmath7 ( by multiple scattering process )",
    ". then one can get @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the angle of particle due to regular motion in accordance with eq.(1 ) averaging over different values of @xmath7 we obtain the following equations @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the variable value and mean energy losses of the transversal energy .    after averaging over different angles for different particles we get distribution function over changing transversal energy ( from distribution function over plane scattered angle ) : @xmath13},\\ ] ] where",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are expressed through the mean square angle of multiple scattering @xmath16 : @xmath17    note that function f satisfies to the following equation : @xmath18 thus we got simple distribution function for one trajectory .",
    "this function depends on only two parameters : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these parameters are independent of the current transversal energy @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that obtained here approximation is valid on a short distance , when parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are small enough with comparing of the characteristic value @xmath20 .    more traditional consideration of a similar problem is based on the diffusion equation with the diffusion coefficients depending on the transversal energy .",
    "this fact strongly complicate possibility for solution .",
    "fig . 1 illustrates behavior of the effective potential @xmath21 as a function of the transversal coordinate x. the main problem of our consideration is determination of an inefficiency of volume reflection of charged particles in bent single crystals .",
    "mechanism of the inefficiency is connected with the volume capture process in these structures . really , the moving particle has some probability to lose ( because of multiple scattering ) its transversal energy and to continue motion in the channeling regime .",
    "however , the captured particle has some probability ( due to dechanneling ) quickly return in underbarrier motion and to be similar as usual particle at volume reflection .",
    "this fact requires the detailed description of the behavior of volume captured particles .    in this section",
    "we find the probability of volume capture .",
    "1 illustrates this process .",
    "obviously that volume capture takes place mainly in the vicinity of critical ( reterned ) point . in fig . 1",
    "this region corresponds to @xmath22 for transversal energies of particle @xmath23 . in ref.@xcite",
    "was shown that particles of beam with the small angle divergence in absence of multiple scattering are equiprobably distributed over transversal energies .",
    "multiple scattering changes the initial distribution of particle over transversal energies .",
    "however , the particle distribution in every energy period @xmath20 keeps approximately equiprobable .",
    "evidence is similar to considered case in ref.@xcite .",
    "multiple scattering we consider as in an amorphous medium but instead constant nuclear density we use variable one in accordance with a current particle position . for",
    "this one can give different theoretical likelihood explanations but more evident argument is fact that monte carlo calculations at the above mentioned assumptions give a good agreement with experiments .",
    "taking into account stated assumptions we define the probability of volume capture as an normalized number of particles ( with the initial energy range from @xmath24 till @xmath25 ) which obtain ( due to multiple scattering ) the transversal energy corresponding to finite planar motion ( channeling ) .    as illustrated in fig . 1 for every particle with the transversal energy @xmath23 and coming to coordinate @xmath26 there are three different possibilities ( see numbers near curves in fig .",
    "1 ) : 1)to undergo reflection ; 2)to lose the transversal energy and to become particle captured in channeling regime ; 3)to increase the transversal energy , so that @xmath27 . in the case of number 3",
    "theoretically the similar three possibilities is conserved but for small enough bending radii the third variant is impossible practically . at condition of smallness of bending radius the probability for particle ( with @xmath23 ) to lose significantly the transversal energy before coordinate @xmath26 is very small .",
    "thus , we see that the volume capture probability one can represents as a sum of the two terms @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the probability of volume capture in the coordinate range from @xmath26 till @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the probability in the coordinate range from @xmath30 till @xmath32 .",
    "let us calculate the first term @xmath29 .",
    "our consideration will be based on one - trajectory approximation .",
    "eq.(5 ) gives the distribution for one trajectory of particle with the transversal energy @xmath2 .",
    "the summary distribution function is a result of integration over all the range of transversal energies ( from @xmath24 till @xmath33 ) . taking this into account we get the probability to change the transversal energy @xmath2 of a particle less than the critical energy @xmath34 in the following form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the mean and square mean losses of transversal energy ( see eqs.(6)-(7 ) ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40",
    ". one can write the following equations for the mean and mean square energy losses : @xmath41",
    "@xmath42 here @xmath43 is the constant value , @xmath44 is the radiation length of a single crystal and @xmath45 and @xmath46 functions are : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the planar atomic and electron densities for a selected plane of single crystal , @xmath50 is the atomic number , @xmath51 is the mean atomic density ( @xmath52 is number atoms in a fundamental cell of volume @xmath53 ) .",
    "@xmath54 is time which corresponds to finding of particle in the nearest local maximum of u(x ) before critical point @xmath55 ( for this particle ) .",
    "time @xmath56 corresponds to location of the particle in a critical point .",

    "note the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 are periodic functions of @xmath69-variable with the period equal to 1 .",
    "the probability @xmath74 one can presented as sum of two first terms of taylor series in the vicinity of @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the critical radius of channeling ( @xmath79 is the maximal value of the interplanar electrical field ) . thus , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( radius @xmath82 corresponds to @xmath75-value ) .",

    "( 20 ) in the following form : @xmath87 where @xmath88    the distribution of scattered particles over the relative transversal energy @xmath89 follows from integration of eq.(7 ) : @xmath90 this function describes the all scattered particles at @xmath91 .",
    "the case @xmath92 corresponds to particles with @xmath93 and the case @xmath94 corresponds to particles with @xmath95 .",
    "it is significant to note that here and below ( in similar equations ) the values @xmath96 and @xmath97 are functions of the integration variable .",
    "integration of eq.(23 ) at condition @xmath92 gives eq.(9 ) for total number particles , and at condition @xmath98 gives corresponding total number of particles with @xmath99 : @xmath100 the distribution of captured particles ( due to the additional process , see the trajectory 3 in fig.1 ) is @xmath101 \\over \\sigma}d\\xi^{'}.\\ ] ] here @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , where @xmath19 and @xmath105 are the corresponding transversal energies ( see fig .",

    "note our consideration of volume capture is valid for small enough bending radii of single crystals .",
    "the range of applicability of present description we will study below .",
    "for some time the captured particles move in a planar channel , but due to multiple scattering ( in the channeling regime ) these particles obtain transversal energies which exceed the potential barrier and hence the part of them return in underbarrier motion . in this section",
    "we consider this process on the basis of one - trajectory diffusion approximation .    for calculations we need to know the losses of transversal energy of a channeled particle . for this aim we can use eqs .",
    "( 17)-(18 ) .",
    "however , we should put the transversal energy @xmath108 at location of particles in the range @xmath109 ( @xmath110 , see fig .",
    "1 ) . at this condition",
    "a particle will be in the channeling regime . at first , we find the mean and mean square losses of a transversal energy per one period of motion @xmath111 ( @xmath112 is a function of a transversal energy )",

    "note due to periodicity of the process we wrote @xmath119-value as the argument of @xmath121-function ( instead of @xmath122 ) .",
    "obviously this equation is valid for small enough @xmath114-values while the captured particles have transversal energies more than @xmath123 .",
    "integration of @xmath124-function over @xmath120 ( from @xmath125 till 0 ) gives the normalized number of channeling particles @xmath126 .",
    "relations describing the angle distributions of scattered particles in the process of volume reflection were obtained in ref.@xcite . however",
    ", these relations do not take into account the volume capture .",
    "if we want take into account this factor we should divide all particles on two sorts .",
    "the first sort is the particles which were not captured and the second one is the captured particles .",
    "the number of particles of the first sort is @xmath127 and the number of particles of the second sort is @xmath74 . the summary angle distribution of particles may be represented as @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the angle distribution of pure volume reflected particles ( see detail description in ref.@xcite ) and @xmath130 is the angle distribution of volume captured particles .",
    "let us consider the bent single crystal of the finite thickness @xmath131 .",
    "then the volume captured particles we can represent as a sum of the two fraction : the first fraction @xmath132 is the particles which enter from a single crystal in the channeling regime ( overbarrier motion ) and the second one @xmath133 is the particles which transmitted from channeling in underbarrier motion ( due to dechanneling mechanism ) .",
    "let us suppose that normalized number particles of the first fraction is @xmath134 , then the normalized number of particles in the second fraction is equal to @xmath135 .    in ref.@xcite the term `` physically narrow angle distribution of entering particles '' was introduced .",
    "this term means that characteristic size of angle distribution of the entering particles \" exceeds the angle period @xmath136 ( here @xmath137 is initial angle of particle ) and particles are uniformly distributed within this period . to this point",
    "we consider the multiple scattering only in narrow range of transversal coordinate @xmath138 , see eqs.(17 ) and ( 18 ) ) . in this approximation",
    "we can write @xmath139 here @xmath140 is the mean angle of volume reflection , and angle @xmath141 , where @xmath142 , and @xmath143 or @xmath144 at @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) , respectively .",
    "this equation is valid for symmetric case of orientation of a single crystal . note the case of nonsymmetric orientation",
    "is considered analogously .",
    "1b illustrates the geometry for eq.(27 ) . here",
    "the broken line cod represents motion of a particle due to volume reflection .",
    "the lines ce and od are the directions of particle motion before and after process .",

    "it means that the angle between od- line ( direction of volume reflection ) and the current direction of channeling flux is approximately equal to @xmath147 ( see eq.(27 ) ) .    for final result we should take into account multiple scattering in the body of a single crystal .",
    "in accordance with ref.@xcite we get @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the distribution function of multiple scattering with @xmath150 corresponding to thickness @xmath151 ( @xmath152 is the part of particle path in the body of single crystal which corresponds to motion in the channeling regime ) .    in our model",
    "the process of volume capture takes place in the transversal space from @xmath153 till @xmath154 ( see fig .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath155-function distribution of the captured particles . in reality , multiple scattering distributed this process in some transversal area and hence in some longitudinal space .",
    "one can describe the evolution of distribution of volume captured particles with the help of the function @xcite : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the mean squared angle of multiple scattering corresponding to approximately half of single crystal thickness .",
    "the density of dechanneling particles as a function of the length @xmath114 ( or the angle @xmath158 ) is described by the relation as eqs.(27 ) and ( 28 ) ( at the condition @xmath159 ) but for @xmath150 should be taken for a length equal to @xmath160 .",
    "it means that we consider particles in the vicinity of local variable @xmath114 and do not taken into account further motion in the body of a single crystal .",
    "let us denote this function as @xmath161 ( or @xmath162 ) .",
    "now we can describe the behavior of channeling fraction as a function of the length ( or the angle @xmath158 ) by the following equation : @xmath163    now we can find the angle distribution of channeling fraction .",

    "in this section in accordance with obtained equations we present calculations of volume reflection process , which taking account the processes of volume capture and channeling in bent single crystals . for illustration we selected some energies of proton beams which approximately corresponds to energies of well - known accelerators .",
    "the main and detailed calculations were done for silicon single crystals , but some results were obtained and for some another single crystals . for calculation of the potential , electric field ,",
    "electron and atomic densities in silicon we use values of atomic form factors from x - ray experiments .",
    "the method of calculations one can find in ref.@xcite .",
    "note recent experimental data @xcite show that the potential from x - ray diffraction gives more precise description of measured characteristics of volume reflection for a silicon single crystal than molier potential .      for determination of different distribution functions we should know the mean and mean squared energy losses of particles ( see eqs.(17)-(18 ) ) .",
    "2 illustrates these quantities for over and underbarrier motion of 400 gev / c protons . for these calculations we use",
    "@xmath169 ( see eqs.(10)-(11 ) ) .",
    "this choice was based on equation for the mean square angle of multiple scattering @xcite @xmath170/\\beta cp \\sqrt{l / x_0}[1 + 0.038\\ln{(l / x_0)}]$ ] , where @xmath171 is the particle momentum . for a small thickness @xmath114 @xmath172 and more natural law @xmath173",
    "the best agreement is at @xmath174 .",
    "it is easy to recalculate the results of fig . 2 for any energy of particles ( see eqs.(17)-(18 ) ) .",
    "the universal functions @xmath175 and @xmath176 one can also find from fig .",
    "2 .      the volume capture probability represents the sum of two terms @xmath177 . initially we consider behavior of the first term @xmath29 .",
    "3 illustrates the calculations of this value for different proton energies .",
    "one can see that at small values @xmath178 @xmath74 is approximated good enough by linear function . from eq.(21 ) we see that value @xmath179 is defined by @xmath180-integral .",
    "4 illustrates calculated @xmath181-value as a function of @xmath75 .",
    "we see long enough plateau beginning from @xmath75 slightly more than @xmath182 .",
    "it is convenient to select such @xmath75 that @xmath183 , where we denote this special value of @xmath75- set as @xmath184 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath185 where @xmath75 is any value of @xmath86 in the range of linearity of @xmath29 function . according to our calculation for the silicon ( 110 ) plane @xmath186 .",
    "now we can wrote the following relation : @xmath187 here we denote the linear approximation of @xmath29 ( see eq.(9 ) ) as @xmath188 and the plateau value of @xmath181 as @xmath189 .",
    "we calculated also value @xmath31 ( see eq.(25 ) ) for different crystals .",
    "according to these calculations relation @xmath190 is approximately equal to 0.41- 0.37 at @xmath191 , correspondingly .",
    "we think that we can decide this relation approximately constant in this region of radii and equal to 0.39 .",

    "fig.5 illustrates behavior of the relations @xmath195 and @xmath196 as functions of variable @xmath197 .",
    "one can see that in the region from @xmath198 till @xmath199 these relations are constant with a good enough accuracy .",
    "thus , eq.(34 ) allows one to describe by universal way the probability of volume capture in the area of interest to us .",

    "6 illustrates the differential over energy distributions of captured protons which were calculated with the help of eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 25 ) .",
    "we see that these distributions become more wide with the increasing of the bending radius .      the channeling of captured particles we illustrate for proton energy 400 gev and 10 m bending radius for the ( 110 ) plane of a silicon single crystal .",
    "the similar simulations based on monte carlo calculations for these parameters presented in ref.@xcite . and hence , we can compare results which were carried out by different methods .",
    "eq.(26 ) allow one to calculate the flux of particles which were captured in the channeling regime .",
    "fig.7 shows behavior of the flux as a function of the thickness of a crystal .",
    "the curves 1 and 2 ( see fig.7b ) present the speed of dechanneling as a function of variable bending angle for cases without and with consideration of multiple scattering in a silicon crystal . in this figure",
    "the curve 3 presents the distribution function of dechanneling particles on the exit of a single crystal .",
    "the total number of captured particles is @xmath200 .",
    "the same number is @xmath201 accordingly to ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , the total scattering curve ( with taking account the volume capture process ) represents the sum of the third curves :    \\i ) pure volume reflection curve ;    \\ii ) the curve of the dechanneling fraction ;    \\iii ) the curve of the channeling fraction .",
    "the resulting curve ( for 400 gev protons and 10 m bending radius of ( 110 ) plane silicon single crystal ) is shown in figs . 8 and 9 in linear and logarithmic scales ,",
    "the curve of channeling fraction was calculated with accordance of eq.(31 ) .",
    "the semiperiod in eq.(31 ) was chosen at the condition that in the moment of time @xmath54 the transversal velocity is maximal and in the moment of time @xmath202",
    "this velocity is minimal .",
    "one can see that in accordance with the distribution function most particles of channeling fraction are groped near critical channeling angle .",
    "this fact is due to firstly , the large number of particles have high transversal energy and secondly , the time of stay in state with small transversal velocity is considerable larger than with the time of state with the large velocity . it should be noted that experimental observation of two peaks of the channeling curve is practically impossible because of multiple scattering in detectors .",
    "the important characteristics of volume reflection of a beam is the efficiency of the process which defined as a partition of beam which contained in @xmath203 around of mean angle of reflection @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the mean square of angle distribution of a scattered beam .",
    "the calculated for conditions as in figs . 8 and 9",
    "the efficiency is close to 0.98 .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental data @xcite . from this result",
    "follows that at above mentioned definition of the efficiency @xmath206 the total inefficiency ( @xmath207 ) should be significantly less than the probability of volume capture @xmath74 due to a valuable fraction of particles , which quickly return from channeling in underbarier motion ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "as mentioned above our consideration is valid for a small enough bending radii of single crystals .",
    "it is clear that for large bending radii the energy gap @xmath20 becomes very small .",
    "because of this , the particle energy losses can be significantly exceed value @xmath20 , and , consequently , the possibility of volume capture will realized for long enough part of trajectory of particles , instead of short distance from @xmath26 till @xmath32 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    let us estimate the area of application of our analytical description .",
    "taking into account that distribution of energy losses is described by normal one we can write the following condition for validity of obtained in the paper equations : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the maximal value of @xmath15 at fixed @xmath86-parameter .",
    "for the ( 110 ) silicon plane and proton energy equal to 400 gev @xmath210 \\approx 20/r[m]$ ] and @xmath211 ev and we got that our consideration is valid till @xmath212 m ( or for @xmath213 ) .",
    "the area of validity is extended with the increasing of particle energy .",
    "it is important to note that the range @xmath214 is more preferable for utilization of the volume reflection process on accelerators .",
    "really , at these values of radii the mean angle @xmath140 of the process is close to maximal one @xcite and the volume capture process is suppressed in comparing with more large bending radii .    in this paper for small enough bending radii we got simple relation for probability of volume capture @xmath74 in different single crystals . according to this relation",
    "@xmath74 is proportional to @xmath215 .",
    "it means that @xmath74 is a weakly dropping function of particle energy at fixed @xmath178 . for testing of this dependence",
    "we carried out monte carlo calculations of @xmath74 at different radii and energies .",
    "the results of these calculations are described by the function which is proportional to @xmath216 .",
    "these dependence is close to obtained one in this paper .",
    "we plan to continue monte carlo calculations with the aim of obtaining large statistics and hope to find the degree at @xmath1 which gives the best description of volume capture .",
    "process of volume capture was investigated also in ref.@xcite . here",
    "the probability of volume capture is @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the dechanneling length , which is proportional to particle energy .",
    "it means that @xmath74 is proportional to @xmath219.the paper @xcite contains the criticism of this relation .",
    "authors @xcite give the conclusion about incorrectness of the relation and try to correct its by introducing of a nuclear dechanneling length .",
    "this correction allow one to get values of probability close to monte carlo calculations ( for energy 400 gev ) but conserve the previous energy dependence .",
    "the main results of our investigation of volume reflection of relativistic particles are :    \\1 ) the simple analytical relations for probability of volume capture are obtained ;    \\2 ) propagation of volume captured fraction inside a single crystal is considered ;    \\3 ) the analytical method for calculation of the angle scattered distribution of particles , taking into account different processes are developed ;    \\4 ) presented here equations allow one to find efficiency of the volume reflection process but analysys of this problem is beyond of the scope of this paper .",
