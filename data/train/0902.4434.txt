    "the bisognano - wichmann theorem states that a large class of models in relativistic quantum field theory satisfies modular covariance , namely : the modular unitary group  @xcite of the field algebra associated to a ( rindler ) wedge region coincides with the unitary group representing the boosts which preserve the wedge .",
    "since the boosts associated to all wedge regions generate the poincar group , modular covariance implies that the representation of the poincar group is encoded intrinsically in the field algebra .",
    "this has important consequences , most prominently the spin - statistics theorem , the particle / anti - particle symmetry and the cpt theorem  @xcite .",
    "modular covariance also implies a maximality condition for the field algebra , namely the duality property  @xcite , and it implies the unruh effect  @xcite , namely that for a uniformly accelerated observer the vacuum looks like a heat bath whose temperature is ( acceleration)@xmath0 .",
    "the original theorem of bisognano and wichmann  @xcite relied on the cpt theorem  @xcite and was valid for finite component wightman fields .",
    "however , the physical significance of this latter hypothesis is unclear . in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory  @xcite ,",
    "guido and longo have derived modular covariance in complete generality for conformally covariant theories  @xcite . in the four - dimensional poincar covariant case",
    "the bisognano - wichmann theorem has been shown by the author  @xcite to hold under physically transparent conditions , namely for massive theories with asymptotic completeness .",

    "modular covariance and the cpt theorem are also expected  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* assumption  4.1 ) to hold under certain conditions , but so far have not been proved in a model - independent way . the aim of the present article is to prove these theorems from first principles for massive poincar covariant plektons satisfying asymptotic completeness .",

    "( note that then , by covariance , the modular groups associated to other wedges @xmath18 represent in the same way the corresponding boosts @xmath19 , and hence the entire representation @xmath16 is fixed by the modular data . ) the cpt theorem , on the other hand , asserts the existence of an anti - unitary cpt operator @xmath20 which represents the reflexion as the @xmath21 transformation .",
    "the total spacetime inversion arises in four - dimensional spacetime from @xmath22 through a @xmath23-rotation about the @xmath11-axis , and is thus also a symmetry . in the odd - dimensional case at hand",
    ", @xmath22 is the proper candidate for a symmetry ( in combination with charge conjugation ) , while the total spacetime inversion is not  in fact , the latter _ can not _ be a symmetry in the presence of braid group statistics  @xcite[propercpt ] . ]",

    "@xmath28 here , @xmath29 is a spacetime region within a suitable class .",
    "further , if a field @xmath30 carries a certain charge then @xmath31 the cpt theorem has been used as an input to the proof of modular covariance by bisognano and wichmann  @xcite .",
    "conversely , the work of guido and longo  @xcite , and kuckert  @xcite , has shown that modular covariance implies the cpt theorem .",
    "in particular , guido and longo have shown  @xcite that modular covariance of the _ observable _ algebra @xmath32 implies that the corresponding modular conjugation is a `` pt '' operator on the observable level , namely satisfies eq .   on the vacuum hilbert space and eq .   with @xmath33 instead of @xmath34 .",
    "further , it intertwines a charged sector with its conjugate sector in the sense of representations , see eq.s   and below .",
    "therefore , the modular conjugation can be considered a cpt operator .",
    "these results also hold in theories with braid group statistics . in the _ absence _ of braid group statistics",
    ", the cpt theorem can be made much more explicit  @xcite , namely on the level of the field algebra .",
    "in fact , in this case the modular conjugation associated with @xmath6 , multiplied with the so - called twist operator , is a cpt operator in the sense of eq.s  , and .    in extending the bisognano - wichmann and cpt theorems to the case of braid group statistics ,",
    "one encounters several difficulties . since in this case",
    "there are no wightman fields , the original proofs of the cpt and bisognano - wichmann theorems do not work .",
    "also the proof of modular covariance in  @xcite and the derivation of the explicit cpt theorem on the level of the field algebra from modular covariance  @xcite do not go through , on two accounts .",
    "firstly , the `` fractional spin '' representations of the universal covering group of the poincar group do not share certain analyticity properties of the ( half- ) integer spin representations which have been used in  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been settled in the article  @xcite , whose results have been used to prove the spin - statistics theorem for plektons  @xcite . secondly , the derivations of modular covariance in  @xcite and of the cpt theorem in  @xcite rely on the existence of an algebra @xmath35 of charge carrying field operators containing the observables @xmath36 as the sub - algebra of invariants under a ( global ) gauge symmetry and such that the vacuum is cyclic and separating for the local field algebras",
    ". such a frame , which we shall call the wick - wightman - wigner ( www ) scenario , always exists in the case of permutation group statistics  @xcite , but does not exist in the case of non - abelian braid group statistics .",
    "then it is not even clear what the proper candidate for the tomita operator should be .",
    "we use here a `` pseudo''-tomita operator which has already been proposed by fredenhagen , rehren and schroer  @xcite .",
    "a major problem then is that one can not use the algebraic relations of the modular objects among themselves and with respect to the field algebra , and with the representers of the translations .",
    "these relations are asserted by tomita - takesaki s and borchers  @xcite theorems , respectively , and enter crucially into the derivation of modular covariance and the cpt theorem in  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been partially settled in  @xcite , where the algebraic relations of our pseudo - modular objects among themselves and with the translations have been analyzed .    in the present paper , we prove _ pseudo - modular covariance _ , namely that eq",
    ".   holds with @xmath9 standing for the pseudo - modular unitary group .",
    "we also show that the pseudo - modular conjugation already is a cpt operator in the sense of eq.s  , and .",
    "our line of argument parallels widely that of  @xcite . in the special case of anyons , there does exist a www scenario and we show modular covariance in the usual sense .    the article is organized as follows . in section  [ secass ]",
    "we specify our framework and assumptions in some detail . as our field algebra we shall use the reduced field bundle  @xcite .",
    "this is a @xmath37-algebra @xmath35 acting on a hilbert space which contains , apart from the vacuum hilbert space , subspaces corresponding to all charged sectors under consideration .",
    "it contains the observable algebra as the sub - algebra which leaves the vacuum hilbert space invariant .",
    "however , in contrast to the field algebra in the permutation group statistics case it does not fulfil the www scenario . in particular the vacuum is not separating for the local algebras , and worse : _ every _ field operator @xmath30 which carries non - trivial charge satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "correspondingly , there are no tomita operators in the literal sense .",
    "this may be circumvented as proposed in  @xcite : there is a ( non - involutive ) pseudo - adjoint @xmath39 on @xmath35 which coincides with the operator adjoint only for observables .",
    "the point here is that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , is a well - defined closable anti - linear operator . , but also on certain paths in a sense to be specified in section  [ secass ] . in the definition of the pseudo - tomita operator , @xmath1",
    "must therefore be replaced by a path @xmath42 , see eq .  .",
    "] we define now @xmath43 as in eq .  , with @xmath5 replaced by @xmath44 , and call @xmath45 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 the pseudo - tomita operator , pseudo - modular conjugation and pseudo - modular unitary group , respectively , associated with @xmath6",
    " we add the word `` pseudo '' because @xmath45 is not a tomita operator in the strict sense ( it is not even an involution ) . in section  [ secalg ]",
    ", we express the pseudo - tomita operator @xmath3 in terms of a family of relative tomita operators  @xcite associated with the observable algebra @xmath32 and certain suitably chosen pairs of states , and recall some algebraic properties of these objects established in  @xcite . using these properties , we show that the pseudo - modular group associated with @xmath6 leaves this algebra invariant ( proposition  [ fainv ] ) , just as in the case of a genuine modular group . in section  [ sech1 ]",
    "we derive single particle versions of pseudo - modular covariance and the cpt theorem ( corollary  [ cormodcov1 ] ) from our assumption that the theory be purely massive .",
    "this was already partially implicit in  @xcite .",
    "we then prove , in section  [ sechex ] , that this property passes over from the single particle states to scattering states . under the assumption of asymptotic completeness ,",
    "this amounts to pseudo - modular covariance of the field algebra .",
    "this is our main result , stated in theorem  [ modcov ] .",
    "since the @xmath46-adjoint coincides with the operator adjoint on the observables , the restriction of @xmath3 to the vacuum hilbert space coincides with the ( genuine ) tomita operator of the observables .",
    "we therefore have then modular covariance , in the usual sense , of the observables .",
    "as explained above , this also implies the cpt theorem on the level of observables . in section  [ seccpt ]",
    "we make the cpt theorem explicit and show that the pseudo - modular conjugation of the field algebra @xmath6 is a cpt operator in the sense of eq.s  , is now understood to be a path of space - like cones as explained in section  [ secass ] . ] and   ( theorem  [ modcovconj ] ) . to this end , we use the mentioned cpt theorem on the observable level  @xcite , as well as the algebraic properties of the `` pseudo''-modular objects established in  @xcite .",

    "* eq .  ( 1.4 ) ) must be assumed .",
    "this does not influence the validity of its consequences , in particular of the cpt theorem ( proposition 9 ) . ] ) in section  [ secanyons ] we finally treat the case of anyons , where there is known to be a field algebra @xmath49 in the www sense  @xcite . in particular , the vacuum is cyclic and separating for @xmath50 , allowing for the definition of a ( genuine ) tomita operator associated with the wedge . considering the genuine modular objects , we prove modular covariance ( theorem  [ modcovany ] ) .",
    "we finally show that the modular conjugation , multiplied with an appropriate twist operator , is a cpt operator ( theorem  [ cptany ] ) .",
