    "the importance of the accretion of matter onto compact objects as a key process for generation of energy around compact objects has been recognized since early 70-ties .",
    "in fact , three basic modes for the interaction of compact object with the surrounding matter have been distinguished , i.e. the ejector , accretor and propeller modes .",
    "these different models have been observed and investigated in the broad energy range .",
    "it is expected that neutron stars ( nss ) can change their accretion modes with the evolution of their parameters ( rotational period , magnetic field strength ) or with the change of the parameters of the surrounding medium .",
    "in fact , the external conditions around ejecting pulsars can change significantly when they enter from time to time dense clouds in the interstellar medium .",
    "the surrounding plasma , attracted by strong gravitational field of the neutron star , can overcome the pressure of the pulsar wind initializing the transition from the ejecting to the accreting pulsar .",
    "similar transition process can also happen in the opposite direction when the accreting neutron star emerges from a dense cloud into a rare interstellar medium .",
    "recently , transition stages between the ejector and accretor modes have been discovered in a few millisecond pulsars within low mass binary systems ( psr j1023 + 0038  @xcite , igr j18245 - 2452  @xcite , and xss j12270 - 4859@xcite ) .",
    "such transition from the ejecting stage ( active radio pulsar ) to the accreting stage resulted also in an enhanced @xmath0-ray emission above @xmath2 mev  @xcite . in the case of sources mentioned above , the appearance of an accretion disk",
    "is well documented in one of the transition stages .",
    "therefore , the accretion process occurs in a quite complicated way .",
    "a few different models have been recently proposed as possible explanation of the transiting msps , see  @xcite .",
    "for example , bednarek  @xcite argues that the accretion disk penetrates in the equatorial region of the rotating neutron star but the radiation processes typical for ejecting pulsars can still operate above the equatorial plane , e.g. as expected in terms of the slot gap model .",
    "in the present paper we suggest that such transition stages can be also present in the case of isolated pulsars which are free flying in the interstellar space . in the case of a pulsar immersed in a spherically - symmetric cloud ,",
    "simple accretion geometry might also put new light on a more complicated processes occurring during transition stages in neutron stars accreting matter in the accretion disk geometry . in this paper",
    "we consider the simplest possible case of a spherically - symmetric accretion onto rotating neutron star .",
    "we show that also in such geometrically simple accretion scenario the transition between the accretion mode and the radio pulsar mode could turn to the specific radiation features in @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "we analyse the case of quasi - spherical accretion of matter onto magnetized , rotating millisecond pulsar which magnetic dipole is aligned with the pulsar rotational axis .",
    "we speculate that physical processes , typical for ejecting and accreting pulsars , could occur along different magnetic field lines during the transition stage in a single object .",
    "the effects on the @xmath0-ray spectrum emitted by pulsars in such simple scenario are discussed .",
    "the quasi - spherical accretion scenario allows easier understanding of complicated physics of the accretion process onto rotating and magnetized ns .",
    "we conclude that different states of @xmath0-ray emission might be also observed in the case of a quasi - spherical accretion of matter from dense interstellar cloud .",
    "6.7truecm    neutron stars , with the mass of 1.4 of the solar mass ( @xmath3 ) and the radius of @xmath4 km , produce strong gravitational field which effectively attracts background matter from the surrounding medium or the matter expelled from the stars in the form of stellar winds .",
    "in the simplest possible case , when the background matter has relatively low angular momentum in respect to the ns , the matter falls onto the ns quasi - spherically .",
    "for example , such quasi - spherical accretion mode is expected in the case of a strong isotropization of the matter after passing through the shock due to the movement of the ns .",
    "the rate of an in - falling matter is described by the so called bondi accretion rate  @xcite .",
    "it depends on the density of surrounding medium ( a cloud ) , @xmath5 @xmath6 , and on the relative velocity of the matter in respect to ns , @xmath7 km s@xmath8 , where @xmath9 km s@xmath8 is the velocity of the ns , @xmath10 km s@xmath8 is the thermal velocity of the gas particles , @xmath11 k is the gas temperature , @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath13 is the hydrogen atom mass . the bondi accretion rate can be expressed by , @xmath14 where the bondi radius is @xmath15 cm . in the case of accretion of matter onto rotating and magnetized ns , the fate of the matter is determined by the parameters of the ns ( its period , magnetic field strength ) and the surrounding matter ( density and temperature ) . if the temperature of the accreting plasma is large than the accreting flow can be stopped by the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this critical temperature is of the order of @xmath16(0.1 - 0.3)@xmath17 , where @xmath18 k is the free fall equipartition temperature and @xmath19 cm is the distance from the ns .",
    "we assume that the plasma temperature is low enough to allow spherical accretion of matter onto ns .",
    "three stages for interaction of ns magnetosphere with the surrounding matter can be defined , ejector , propeller , and accretor modes ( see  @xcite , for more recent review see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "specific modes occur for specific parameters of the ns and surrounding matter .",
    "however , the parameters of the surrounding medium in which ns is immersed can change significantly .",
    "therefore , transitions between different modes should be also observed for specific values of the parameters defining accretion scenario .",
    "the question appears how the transition from the ejecting to the accreting pulsar occurs ? which parts of the pulsar inner magnetosphere are at first penetrated by the matter , equatorial or polar ?",
    "we speculate that at first the matter penetrates the polar regions of the pulsar inner magnetosphere since the magnetic field at the light cylinder in those regions is weaker than at the light cylinder close to the rotational plane of the pulsar .",
    "we argue that during such transition stages different modes of accretion can co - exist in a single object .",
    "we are mainly interested in transitions between ejector and accretor modes which we call intermediate accretion mode .",
    "such intermediate mode is possible since the conditions at different parts of the light cylinder of the rotating neutron star with the dipole structure of the magnetic field can differ significantly . in order to easier",
    "understand the basic features of such intermediate state , we assume that the magnetic moment of the ns is co - aligned with the rotational axis of ns ( see fig .  1 for schematic representation of the geometry ) .",
    "we show that for specific accretion rates the magnetic field energy density at the regions of the light cylinder , which are far away from the rotational plane of the pulsar , can become lower than the energy density of an accreting plasma thus allowing penetration of matter towards the inner pulsar magnetosphere . on the other hand",
    ", the magnetic field energy density can be still larger than the kinetic energy density of the matter at regions of the light cylinder which are close to the rotational plane . as a result",
    ", the accretion of plasma can still occur along the magnetic field lines which cross the light cylinder far away from the rotational plane , i.e. for large values of the angle @xmath20 ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", as expected in the accretor and/or propeller mode of accretion . in contrast , the plasma is still effectively ejected in the region close to the rotational plane of the pulsar which still operates in the ejector mode .",
    "we expect that for some range of the accretion rates , different stages ( accretor and ejector ) can be present in a single ns immersed in the cloud of ionized matter .",
    "the details of such hybrid scenario and expected radiation processes during the transition stage between different modes are discussed in this paper .      now we evaluate which part of the magnetosphere is occupied by different accretion modes for different parameters of the ns and surrounding medium .",
    "we assume that the ns is immersed in the isotropic cloud of ionized matter .",
    "the accretion rate in the case of quasi - spherical scenario will be described by the bondi accretion rate , @xmath21 ( see eq .  1 ) .",
    "then , the density of matter in different parts of the light cylinder depends on the distance from the ns centre , @xmath22 , as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the free fall velocity of accreting matter , @xmath25 is the distance to the light cylinder at the angle @xmath20 ( see fig .  1 ) , @xmath26 cm is the light cylinder radius , @xmath27 s is the pulsar period , @xmath28 is the velocity of light , and @xmath29 is the gravitational constant . on the other hand , also",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field at different parts of the light cylinder is a function of the angle @xmath20 .",
    "the condition which separates the ejecting part of the ns magnetosphere and the accreting part of the magnetosphere can be obtained by comparing the magnetic energy density with the kinetic energy density of accreting matter at the light cylinder radius  @xcite .",
    "these energy densities depend on the angle @xmath20 according to , @xmath30 where the magnetic field at the light cylinder at the distance @xmath22 from the neutron star is given by , @xmath31 with the components of the magnetic field strength , @xmath32 and @xmath33(\\cos\\alpha)^3/r_{\\rm lc}^3 . \\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath34 g  @xmath35 is the magnetic moment of the ns and @xmath36 g is its surface magnetic field strength .",
    "5.5truecm    we determine the critical value of the angle @xmath37 for which energy density of the magnetic field is equal to the kinetic energy density of the accreting matter by solving eq .",
    "3 . this angle separates the accreting part of the magnetosphere from the ejecting part of the magnetosphere as shown in fig .  1 . since the angle @xmath20 is involved in eq .  3 in a complicated way",
    ", we solve this equation numerically .",
    "the results of calculations are shown in fig .  2 for a few selected values of the pulsar period and as a function of the accretion rate of matter onto ns .",
    "note that , for specific accretion rate the value of the angle @xmath37 drastically drops to zero . for larger accretion rates",
    "the ejecting part of pulsar magnetosphere disappears completely and the high energy radiation processes , characteristic for ejecting radio pulsars , are quenched . the parameter space ( accretion rate versus pulsar period ) , at which such `` pure accretor '' mode is expected ,",
    "is shown in fig .  3 for the case of the millisecond pulsars and also for the classical pulsars .",
    "the specific curves in this figure separate the `` pure accretor '' from the `` partial ejector '' mode for a few selected values of the dipole magnetic moment of the neutron star , corresponding to the range of surface magnetic field strengths @xmath38 gs ( in the case of millisecond pulsars , upper figure ) and @xmath39 gs ( in the case of classical pulsars , bottom figure ) .",
    "the hybrid accretion modes are expected in the case of the millisecond pulsars which are able to accrete the matter close to the curves in fig .  3 .",
    "these curves separate partial ejector from pure accretor modes .",
    "note also that , these values of the accretion rates correspond to specific thermal x - ray luminosities of the pulsars in the accretor modes ( see eq .",
    "10 ) . for typical soft x - ray luminosities in the range",
    "@xmath40 erg s@xmath8 , the accretion rates are expected to be in the range @xmath41 g s@xmath8",
    ". therefore , the hybrid accretion mode can be characterised by the specific pulsed x - ray emission from the surface of the ns .",
    "9.truecm    the accretor and quasi - propeller regions in the inner pulsar magnetosphere are separated by the condition that the alfven radius , for the matter penetrating the inner pulsar magnetosphere , is comparable to the co - rotation radius .",
    "the co - rotation radius is calculated by comparing the centrifugal force of the matter , which is attached to the magnetic field lines , with the gravitational force , i.e. @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the rotational velocity of the magnetic field lines , @xmath44 , and x is the distance from rotational axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this condition gives us the co - rotation radius as a function of the angle @xmath20 , @xmath45 the alfven radius is obtained by comparing the energy density of the in - falling plasma ( equal to its gravitational energy ) with the energy density of the magnetic field , @xmath46 , @xmath47/8\\pi , \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the components of the magnetic field at the distance @xmath50 ( see eq .",
    "5 and 6 ) .",
    "the above equation allows us to determine the alfven radius , @xmath51 , as a function of the angle @xmath20 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the accretor mode is separated from the quasi - propeller mode by the condition , @xmath53 .",
    "this condition is reached for specific value of the angle @xmath20 .",
    "we have solved eq .  7 and eq .  8 numerically in order to determine the angle @xmath54 , which separates the quasi - propeller region from the accretor region in the inner pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "we expect that in the case of quasi - propeller mode the accretion of matter also occurs onto the surface of ns since the centrifugal force balances only the component of the gravitational force which is perpendicular to the rotational axis of the ns but not the component along the magnetic field lines .",
    "however , in such case the accretion process , along the magnetic field lines which touches the light cylinder in the range of angles @xmath37 and @xmath54 , occurs with lower in - fall velocity than the free fall velocity .",

    "we assume that this accretion energy is thermalized on the ns surface .",
    "the characteristic temperature of the polar cap region on the ns surface can be estimated for specific radius of the polar cap , @xmath59 .",
    "this radius is defined by the critical magnetic field line which touches the light cylinder radius at the critical angle @xmath37 .",
    "the dipole magnetic field lines ( in the polar coordinates ) are well described by the equation @xmath60",
    "the constant @xmath61 can be evaluated from the condition that the magnetic field line passes through the light cylinder radius at the angle @xmath37 .",
    "then , @xmath62^{-3}$ ] .",
    "the radius of the polar cap is given by , @xmath63 it defines the surface area of the polar cap @xmath64 @xmath65 .",

    "4 the temperature of the hot polar cap region on the ns surface as a function of the bondi accretion rate for a few selected values of the magnetic moment of the ns .",
    "the surface temperature increases for smaller accretion rates but the area of the hot polar cap decreases . the temperature will not increase infinitly since the accretion process can not occur inside the cone around the rotational axis defined by the condition @xmath67 . in fact",
    ", the hot polar cap has a hollow inside due to this condition .",
    "this condition also defines the maximum value of the angle @xmath68 above which the accretion process onto neutron star surface can not occur i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "9.truecm    the density of thermal photons , emitted from this hot polar region , at the distance of the light cylinder radius ( i.e. the approximate distance of the outer gap region ) is estimated on , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "we estimate the mean free path for leptons on the ic scattering of this thermal radiation field ( in the thomson regime ) on , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the thomson cross section , and @xmath74 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "the comparison of this mean free path with the characteristic distance scale for their propagation within the inner magnetosphere , i.e. comparable to the light cylinder radius , allows us to estimate the energies of leptons , @xmath75 mev , for which they lose efficiently energy on the ic process . for some parameters , leptons with such energies can scatter thermal x - rays from the ns surface close to the t regime since the ic scattering at the transition between the thomson ( t ) and the klein - nishina ( k - n ) regimes occurs for @xmath76^{1/4}$ ] mev .",
    "the example @xmath0-ray spectra , produced by the secondary leptons in the outer gap region , are considered in the next section .",
    "the high energy @xmath0-ray production in the inner magnetospheres from over hundred pulsars have been well documented in the recent years  @xcite . although , the details of these radiation and particle acceleration processes are still not exactly known , it is obvious that these processes occur in the pulsar magnetosphere which operates in so called ejector mode , during which relativistic plasma is ejected through the pulsar light cylinder radius and the external matter is not able to enter the inner pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "as we argue above at some intermediate state the ejector mode can be only active in a part of the pulsar magnetosphere and the rest of the magnetosphere ( defined by different magnetic field lines touching the light cylinder radius ) is still able to accrete the matter from the surrounding medium .",
    "we expect that in such intermediate state the radiation processes in the pulsar magnetosphere should become more complicated .",
    "apart from the curvature ( and synchrotron ) radiation of very energetic primary electrons accelerated in the outer gap ( with the lorentz factors @xmath77 ) , expected to be responsible for the pulsed @xmath0-ray spectrum , a population of low energy secondary leptons ( which appears at the magnetic field lines above the outer gap as a result of partial absorption of curvature @xmath0-rays ) can produce additional component in the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "this component is due to the comptonization of the thermal radiation from the ns surface produced by accreting matter along the magnetic field lines above the angle @xmath37 .",
    "it is rather difficult to consider in detail this additional emission due to the lack of detailed knowledge on the spectrum of secondary leptons .",
    "thermal emission from the polar cap can be also responsible for modification of the synchro / curvature @xmath0-ray spectrum produced by primary electrons due to the absorption of multi - gev @xmath0-rays .",
    "the modification of the synchro / curvature primary emission is considered below in a simple absorption scenario .",
    "we assume that the outer gap model  @xcite can still be active in the hybrid accretion scenario discussed above .",
    "we calculate the expected curvature radiation spectrum in the outer gap model in order to have an idea about possible conditions at which such additional spectral components could be also observed .",
    "we apply the simple model for the acceleration of leptons ( and their radiation ) in the outer gap which details are summarized in  @xcite . in this model the primary electrons are accelerated in the electric field of the outer gap with the electric field strength , @xmath78 where @xmath79 cm , @xmath80 is the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder , and @xmath81 is the gap thickness typically of the order of @xmath82 for the millisecond pulsars  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray luminosity produced by primary electrons in the curvature process is , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the rotational energy loss rate of the pulsar .",
    "primary electrons accelerated in the outer gap produce observed pulsed emission in the curvature radiation process with the characteristic energies @xmath85 gev .",
    "the energy loss rate of these electrons on the curvature process is @xmath86 ev cm@xmath8 .",
    "the comparison of the acceleration efficiency , @xmath88 , with the curvature energy loss rate allows us to estimate the equilibrium lorentz factor of primary electrons in the outer gap @xmath89 .",
    "these electrons lose energy on characteristic distance scale , @xmath90 , which is , @xmath91 for electrons with the equilibrium lorentz factors .",
    "this is about an order of magnitude less than the light cylinder radius .",
    "so then , the process is efficient for electrons with the equilibrium energies .",
    "we estimate the characteristic energies of curvature @xmath0-rays produced by the primary electrons in the outer gap for the some example parameters of the pulsar , @xmath92 g and @xmath93 ms and the gap thickness @xmath94 .",
    "the equilibrium lorentz factor of electrons for these parameters is equal to @xmath95 and the characteristic energy of the curvature photons is @xmath96 gev .",
    "however , curvature @xmath0-rays with such energies might be efficiently absorbed in the thermal radiation from the polar cap .",
    "the absorption becomes important for @xmath0-rays with energies , @xmath97 where @xmath98 , and @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we estimate whether such absorption process of @xmath0-rays is efficient by comparing the @xmath0-ray mean free path , @xmath99 with the characteristic distance scale of the interaction process given by the light cylinder radius .",
    "the mean free path can be estimated on , @xmath100 where @xmath101 ph .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath102 is the cross section for @xmath103 pair production in @xmath104 collision .",
    "this mean free path is shorter than the light cylinder radius for the pulsars with periods , @xmath105 we conclude that in the case of short period pulsars and large accretion luminosities the curvature @xmath0-rays with @xmath161 gev energies , produced in the outer gap by primary leptons , should be efficiently absorbed in the thermal radiation from the hot polar cap .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-ray spectra in the transition state should be truncated at about @xmath161 gev in contrast to the @xmath0-ray spectra from observed msps which extend through the gev energy range .",
    "we argue that in the case of quasi - spherical accretion process the pulsar magnetosphere separates on two parts , the accreting part in the polar regions and the ejecting part in the equator regions .",
    "both parts of the magnetosphere can be active in this same pulsar provided that it is close to the transition from the ejector to the accretor stage ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the duration of such transition state depends on the stability of medium in which msp is immersed . in the case of considered msp within a dense cloud",
    "it is determined by the homogeneity of the cloud . in such case",
    "the duration of the transition state is of the order of the dimension of the clamps within the cloud divided by the velocity of the pulsar . on the longer time scale",
    "the transition state can be also influenced by evolution of the parameters of the pulsar .",
    "proposed hybrid magnetosphere is caused by different conditions in the pulsar magnetosphere at the light cylinder region at different distance from the rotational plane . for simplicity we analysed the case of a simple model for the neutron star which is an aligned magnetic rotator immersed in a quasi - spherical cloud of ionized matter .",
    "it is shown that for some parameters of the ns and the bondi accretion rate of matter onto the ns , a part of the magnetosphere close to the rotational plane is expected to be in the ejector mode and a part of the magnetosphere farther from the plane is already in the accretor mode ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the accreting matter falls onto the small part of the ns surface creating a hot spot with the characteristic temperature of the order of a few million k. this strong radiation creates additional background in the inner pulsar magnetosphere which has to be taken into account when analysing the radiation processes .",
    "we propose that the synchro / curvature @xmath0-ray spectrum produced by primary electrons in the inner magnetosphere during such intermediate state , should be truncated at @xmath1 gev due to its absorption in the thermal radiation from the polar cap .",
    "therefore the @xmath0-ray spectra from the pulsars in the intermediate state should differ significantly from the pulsars in the ejecting state .",
    "in fact , the presence of additional strong radiation field in the pulsar gap region should significantly modify also the gap acceleration mechanism and so curvature emission .",
    "however , it is difficult to consider in detail acceleration and radiation processes in such additional conditions . therefore we leave their detailed discussion to the future investigations .    up to",
    "now none of observed isolated msps shows the change of the @xmath0-ray emission state expected in this model .",
    "the reason may be that none of these msps fulfil the conditions for the proposed state to occur .",
    "we have shown that the msp should be immersed in relatively dense environment . moreover",
    ", the accretion rate should be not to large , since then the msp moves to pure accretor state , but also not to low , since then the thermal luminosity from the neutron star surface due to the accretion process is too weak to influence radiation processes in the inner pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "here we considered only the simple case of aligned ( or almost aligned ) rotator model for the pulsar magnetosphere in order to show that such two - component , accreting / ejecting magnetosphere of the pulsar might be observed . in the case of highly oblique rotators ,",
    "the matter accreting through the light cylinder radius at large distances from the rotational plane may have problems with reaching the ns surface due to the geometry of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder will change with the pulsar period .",
    "therefore the conditions for accretion of matter onto ns will also periodically change . as a result",
    ", the matter is expected to fall onto the ns surface in the form of bunches only when the condition given by eq .",
    "3 is fulfilled .",
    "such transitional accretion , modulated with the period of the pulsar , does not need to be in phase with the @xmath0-ray emission from the parts of the magnetosphere near the light cylinder .",
    "however , the cumulative accretion rate is expected to be reduced in the case of oblique rotator .",
    "this will influence the thermal radiation field from ns surface and also eventual absorption of curvature / synchrotron radiation from the pulsar gaps .",
    "therefore , we conclude that such characteristic truncated at @xmath1 gev gamma - ray spectra are likely to be present only in the case of magnetic rotators which magnetic axis is nearly aligned to the rotational axis of the neutron star .",

    "<S> the radiation processes characteristic for the ejecting pulsar , i.e. curvature and synchrotron radiation produced by primary electrons in the pulsar outer gap , are expected to be modified by the presence of additional thermal radiation from the neutron star surface . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that during the transition from the pure ejector to the pure accretor mode ( or vice versa ) an intermediate accretion state can be distinguished which is characterised by the @xmath0-ray spectra of pulsars truncated below @xmath1 gev due to the absorption of synchro / curvature spectrum produced in the pulsar gaps .    </S>",
