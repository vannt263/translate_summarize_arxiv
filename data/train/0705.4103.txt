    "the discovery that most elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges host a black hole at their centers , plus the tight relations observed between black - hole mass @xmath3 and galaxy luminosity @xmath9 or stellar velocity dispersion @xmath10 @xcite , suggest that the formation and growth of central black holes is deeply intertwined with that of their host galaxies .",
    "recent theoretical work ( e.g. , @xcite ) supports this view , and also predicts how the relations between the properties of black holes and their host galaxies have changed over time .",
    "direct observation of the evolution of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 relations over cosmological time would offer unique insight into galaxy and black - hole formation .",
    "there have been many attempts to measure the evolution of the @xmath3 relations ; we cite a partial list of these :    * @xcite examine a sample of quasars at redshifts up to 3.3 .",
    "the luminosity @xmath9 and velocity dispersion @xmath10 of the host galaxy in such objects can not be measured reliably because the light from the galaxy is overwhelmed by the quasar flux ; instead , they use the width of the narrow [ o iii ] emission line as a surrogate for @xmath10 .",
    "they estimate the black - hole mass using the `` photoionization '' method , which is based on an empirically calibrated relation involving the continuum luminosity of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and the width of the h@xmath11 or other broad emission lines .",
    "the theoretical assumptions that underlie this relation are that the bulk velocities of the emitting clouds are determined by their orbital motion in the gravitational field of the black hole , and that the emitting region is photoionized by an ultraviolet continuum spectrum of fixed shape .",
    "they find an @xmath0 relation that is consistent with the local one , suggesting that this relation is independent of redshift . * using similar methods on a larger but lower - redshift quasar sample from the sloan digital sky survey",
    ", @xcite find that galaxies of a given dispersion at @xmath12 have black - hole masses that are larger by @xmath13 than at @xmath14 .",
    "* @xcite and @xcite measured the velocity dispersion of 14 seyfert i galaxies at redshift @xmath15 ; they used stellar absorption lines , which should provide a more direct measure of the dispersion than emission lines .",
    "they measured the black - hole mass using the photoionization method .",
    "they found that galaxies of a given dispersion at @xmath15 host black holes having @xmath16 .",
    "* @xcite measured the bulge luminosities of 11 quasar hosts in the redshift range @xmath17 using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and estimated their black - hole masses using the photoionization method .",
    "they conclude that the @xmath1 relation at @xmath18 is close to the relation at @xmath14 ; @xmath19 .",
    "this result is remarkable since black holes can only grow with time , while elliptical galaxies fade with time as their stars die : even if the black holes do not grow at all , passive stellar evolution models would predict @xmath20 between @xmath21 and @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "if their result is correct , then either black holes must be ejected from the galaxy centers and replaced with smaller ones , or the galaxy luminosity must grow substantially through mergers .",
    "a common thread among all these investigations and others is that the high - redshift sample is selected by some measure of agn visibility .",
    "black - hole masses and galaxy properties are then derived and an @xmath0 or @xmath1 relation is fitted to the data . since the low - redshift relations are linear in @xmath24 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ( eqs . [ eqn : msig ] or [ eqn : ml_hr ] below ) , the high - redshift data are often analyzed by assuming that the slope of the relation is the same as at low redshift and estimating the offset in the intercept or zero - point , which may be expressed as @xmath20 at fixed @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "any such offset is then interpreted as evidence that the ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath10 or @xmath9 has changed over time .",
    "of course , the offset can be ( and sometimes is ) equally well expressed as @xmath25 or @xmath26 at fixed black - hole mass .",
    "proof of evolution in the @xmath3 relations requires demonstrating that the high- and low - redshift galaxy samples were assembled with no selection effects that would bias the relation between the typical galaxy properties and black - hole masses being measured  or , at least , that the selection effects in the high- and low - redshift samples were the same .",
    "this may be a more difficult task than has commonly been assumed .",
    "the local black - hole sample has mostly been drawn from `` normal '' galaxies with quiescent or low levels of nuclear activity . despite the proximity of these galaxies ,",
    "detecting and weighing their central black holes requires exquisite spatial resolution , very high signal - to - noise observations , and elaborate modeling of the observations .",
    "investigating the properties of black holes in nearby galaxies remains a frontier problem ; to date , dynamically determined black - hole masses are available for only slightly more than three dozen galaxies . since there was little evidence of a black hole in most of these galaxies before hst observations were taken ( except sometimes for a modest rise in the velocity dispersion in spectra taken at ground - based resolution ) , and since black holes are found in almost all nearby galaxies that have been examined carefully with hst , the black holes in local quiescent galaxies are selected mainly on the basis of galaxy properties such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the techniques used to measure black - hole masses in quiescent galaxies at low redshift can not be used at high redshift , both because the radius of influence of the black hole can not be resolved beyond a few tens of mpc , and because the galaxies have substantially lower surface brightness , by the factor @xmath27 .",
    "black holes at high redshift are identified instead by their association with agn .",
    "the observer thus _ first _ locates a black hole that is accreting matter and weighs it by the properties of the agn emission lines ( a difficult task , but one that we shall not examine in detail here ) , and then _ secondly _ attempts the ( still difficult ) task of measuring the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "the existence and properties of the agn depend both on the properties of the black hole ( mass , spin , orientation ) and on the properties of the galaxy ( mass inflow rate , orientation , etc . ) . in short ,",
    "selection is done at low redshift by galaxy properties , and at high redshift by a combination of black - hole and galaxy properties that depends on the method used .",
    "galaxy samples obtained with different selection techniques will generally satisfy different @xmath3 relations .",
    "this effect , analogous to the @xcite bias that is familiar in studies of galactic structure , arises because of the cosmic scatter in the @xmath3 relations  there is not ( so far as we know ) an exact 11 relation between black - hole mass and any single measurable property of galaxies such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 . in this paper",
    "we argue that determinations of the redshift evolution of the @xmath3 relations may be strongly biased by selection effects unless the same sample selection techniques are used at all redshifts .",
    "correcting for the selection bias introduced by the use of different sample selection criteria at different redshifts is extremely difficult : to make accurate corrections it is necessary to know both how the selection depends on the galaxy and black - hole properties and the cosmic scatter in the @xmath3 relations . at present",
    "we have only crude upper limits to the latter quantity .",
    "we shall show that even if the cosmic scatter were known , the bias in the samples described above usually can only be corrected with additional information , such as how galaxy properties and black - hole mass determine the probability distribution of agn luminosity",
    ".    the selection bias can be especially large at large @xmath3 , as the following argument shows .",
    "consider the @xmath1 relation . at high",
    "@xmath9 the number density of galaxies falls off rapidly , as illustrated by the steep cutoff in the @xcite luminosity function .",
    "cosmic scatter in the @xmath1 relation implies that there is a distribution of black - hole masses at a given @xmath9 .",
    "the rare high - mass black holes can arise from either the peak of this distribution in the rare galaxies with large @xmath9 , or from the high - mass tail of the distribution in the more numerous galaxies of modest @xmath9 .",
    "if the number density of galaxies is falling off rapidly with @xmath9 , the contribution from galaxies with modest @xmath9 may actually overwhelm the population of black holes of similar mass associated with galaxies of higher @xmath9 .",
    "this problem was first explicitly identified by @xcite in the context of the correlation between black - hole mass and dark - matter halo mass , and by @xcite in the context of the @xmath0 relation , but apparently has not been appreciated by most observers studying the evolution of the @xmath3 relations .",
    "in this paper we present a more general exposition of the biases incurred when studying evolution of the @xmath3 relations by comparing samples obtained by different selection criteria and at different redshifts .",
    "we start by considering the extraction of samples from hypothetical joint distributions of @xmath3 and @xmath9 or @xmath5 we then consider the selection bias that occurs if the high - redshift samples are selected by agn flux or luminosity .",
    "we discuss the prospects of correcting for selection bias , and argue that selection bias may place fundamental limits on the determination of the evolution of the @xmath3 relations .",
    "we conclude with a brief review of attempts to measure the evolution of the @xmath3 relations and how they may have been affected by selection bias .",
    "understanding object selection bias requires knowledge of the joint probability distribution of black - hole mass @xmath3 and a galaxy property @xmath28 which for the present discussion is either @xmath6 , where @xmath9 is the rest - frame @xmath29-band galaxy luminosity , or @xmath7 , where @xmath10 is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the main body of the galaxy ( the precise definition of @xmath9 or @xmath10 does not concern us , so long as it is defined consistently in all samples ) .",
    "the true form of the joint distribution unfortunately is unknown ; however , we can construct a hypothetical form of this distribution that accurately represents the present state of the observations , and in any case suffices to show how sample selection bias can occur .",
    "we write the probability of finding a galaxy in the interval @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath32 where @xmath33 . from the definition of conditional probability",

    "the function @xmath38 is then given by either the volume - limited luminosity function  more properly , the luminosity function of early - type galaxy components ( ellipticals and spiral bulges ) , since these are the components that correlate with black - hole mass  or the velocity - dispersion distribution of early - type components . without loss of generality ,",

    "the physical content of this assumption is that the luminosity history of an agn is determined by the black - hole mass and scales with the eddington luminosity , which is proportional to @xmath3 .",

    "the results of the previous subsections depend on the assumption that the probability distribution of agn luminosity is determined by the black - hole mass and not the galaxy properties ( eq .  [ eq : probone ] ) .",
    "a foil to this is to assume that the luminosity is determined by the galaxy properties and not the black - hole mass .",
    "thus equation ( [ eq : probone ] ) is replaced by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a constant . in this case @xmath152 in any flux - limited or luminosity - limited sample @xcite .",
    "given the example bias calculations shown in the previous section , it may be tempting to conclude that similar bias corrections may be estimated and applied after the fact to existing surveys to determine the @xmath0 or @xmath1 relations .",
    "we believe that in general such corrections are difficult or impossible to apply reliably to current surveys , for the following reasons .      in the examples above , we assumed that at any galaxy property @xmath28 @xmath94 followed a normal distribution about the mean @xmath153 relation @xmath82 , with standard deviation characterized by a cosmic scatter @xmath74 we saw that the bias is very sensitive to @xmath69 ( in most examples @xmath154 ) yet this parameter is poorly known for either the @xmath0 or @xmath1 relations , in part because an accurate estimate of @xmath69 requires knowing the observational errors in the @xmath3 determinations . @xcite",
    "have studied this problem and conclude only that @xmath155 for the @xmath0 relation and @xmath156 for the @xmath1 relation . moreover , the @xcite analysis assumes , as we do , that @xmath69 is constant over the parameter range of the @xmath3 relations ; the sample of galaxies with well - determined @xmath3 is simply too small to explore the possibility that it is not .",
    "even if an accurate estimate of @xmath69 were available , the functional form of the distribution of @xmath157 is unknown .",
    "the assumption of a normal distribution is an obvious first step , yet the steep falloff of the @xmath9 or @xmath10 distribution at large values means that the selection bias for large black - hole masses is sensitive to the wings of this distribution , where @xmath158 .",
    "the assumed normal distribution is likely to _ under_estimate the selection bias since more realistic distributions have fatter tails . given that the local black - hole sample is so small that @xmath69 is poorly determined , the sample of galaxies with good @xmath3 determinations would have to be several orders of magnitudes larger before an accurate form for the scatter function could be determined .",
    "the @xmath3 relations are imperfectly known at @xmath159 and in particular the range of @xmath9 or @xmath10 that is used to determine them is rather limited .",
    "for example , in the sample of 31 local galaxies with measured black - hole masses used by @xcite to determine the @xmath0 relation , the interquartile ranges in @xmath9 and @xmath10 are only factors of 5.3 and 1.6 respectively .",
    "thus , the calculation of the selection biases for @xmath160 must contend with the fact that there are only a few black holes observed in this mass range in the local sample ( 4 in the @xcite sample ) .",
    "@xcite show that the @xmath161 relation must be curved ( in logarithmic coordinates ) in the sense that @xmath10 appears to increase only slowly ( if at all ) with @xmath9 for the most luminous galaxies .",
    "this implies that the present log - linear @xmath0 and @xmath1 relation can not be consistent at high galaxy luminosity .",
    "the joint @xmath153 distributions shown in figure [ fig:2df ] are thus based on extrapolated estimates at the highest @xmath3 values that are likely to change if more and better determinations of black - hole masses @xmath160 become available .",
    "the heart of our analysis of selection bias in   [ sec : bhmass ] and [ sec : bhmasstwo ] is the assumption that the black hole determines the agn luminosity , or more precisely that the galaxy properties do not .",
    "this is clearly true if , for example , ( i ) black holes radiate either at the eddington luminosity @xmath162 or not at all , and ( ii ) the bolometric correction is independent of galaxy properties .",
    "this assumption is also true in more general circumstances , for example , ( i ) can be replaced by the weaker assumption that the probability that a black hole is radiating at some @xmath91 depends only on the ratio @xmath163 ( eq .  [ eq : probone ] ) .",
    "this assumption may be approximately correct : for example , @xcite find that their simulations are well - fit by a model in which the probability distribution of agn luminosities depends only on @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the peak luminosity of the agn and @xmath166 .",
    "nevertheless , if galaxy properties do affect the agn luminosity  most likely by determining the feeding rate of matter onto the black hole at luminosities @xmath167then the biases will be different from those presented in   [ sec : bhmass ] and [ sec : bhmasstwo ] . in the limiting case that the agn luminosity is determined entirely by galaxy properties rather than black - hole mass , as might be plausible for low - luminosity agns , there is no selection bias in a flux- or luminosity - limited survey (  [ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "we have assumed that the joint probability distribution of black - hole mass @xmath43 and galaxy property @xmath37 can be modeled by equation ( [ eqn : joint ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a physical model in which the galaxy property is the independent variable , and the black - hole mass is determined by the properties of the galaxy through the cosmic - scatter function @xmath168 and the @xmath3 relation @xmath42 .",
    "this assumption is convenient for modeling the local sample of galaxies with @xmath3 determinations , which was selected by galaxy properties , plus the ready knowledge of @xmath169 the volume distribution of @xmath48 the alternative model provided by equation ( [ eqn : jointa ] ) , in which the black - hole mass is the independent variable and the galaxy property is determined by the black hole through the function @xmath170 , is much more difficult to fit to the local observations as we have little direct knowledge of @xmath171 the black - hole mass function .",
    "however , our present understanding of black - hole and galaxy formation does not allow us to say which model , if either , is correct .",
    "most of our estimates of selection bias have been based on the assumption that surveys are complete to a given agn luminosity or flux , but this is an oversimplification .",
    "any survey that is based on measurements of the luminosity of the host galaxy requires that the host is bright enough and large enough to be separated from the agn .",
    "any survey that uses the velocity dispersion measured from stellar absorption lines requires that the absorption lines are strong enough , and that agn emission lines in the vicinity of the absorption lines are weak enough , to allow a reliable dispersion measurement . at the opposite extreme , surveys of low - luminosity agns require that the emission lines are strong enough to be detected against the continuum flux from the galaxy .",
    "in such studies the selection depends in a complex way on properties such as the ratio of agn to galaxy luminosity , and on galaxy properties other than @xmath9 or @xmath10 , such as the effective radius or central surface brightness .",
    "we have intended this paper mainly as a planning guide for future surveys to explore the evolution of the @xmath3 relation , rather than as a critique of existing surveys .",
    "the following brief comments on existing surveys are mostly intended to illustrate the application and impact of the estimates of selection bias that we have made in earlier sections .",
    "several authors have determined the @xmath0 relation for nearby agns , and compared this to the local relation for inactive galaxies . using seven seyfert 1 galaxies with black - hole masses measured by reverberation mapping , @xcite find @xmath172 . for 16 agns with reverberation - based black - hole masses @xcite find @xmath173 ( although onken et al .",
    "interpret their result in terms of calibrating the reverberation - mapping method rather than an offset in the @xmath0 relation ) .",
    "@xcite have compared the black - hole masses in dwarf seyfert 1 galaxies to an extrapolation of the @xmath0 relation to lower dispersions ; using black - hole masses based on the photoionization method calibrated by the standard `` isotropic '' formula , they find @xmath174 ( although they interpret their results with onken et al.s calibration and thus find @xmath175 ) . @xcite have measured the @xmath0 relation in 88 nearby agn using the photoionization method to determine @xmath3the sample is much larger than that of @xcite but the photoionization mass estimates are less direct than those from reverberation mapping .",
    "they find @xmath176 .",
    "similarly , @xcite have determined the @xmath1 relation from a sample of 29 quasars with @xmath177 ; they determine black - hole masses using the photoionization method and luminosities using hst photometry .",
    "they find @xmath178 , although they interpret their result in terms of recalibrating the photoionization method .",
    "a common feature of the @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite samples is that their black - hole masses are relatively modest : generally @xmath179 and often more than an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "selection bias occurs at all @xmath2 depending on the local slopes of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 distributions , but these samples are safely removed from the very strong biases seen at large values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 , where the distribution functions are falling rapidly . although we have emphasized selection bias in the context of low- and high - redshift samples with similar black - hole masses , one selected by galaxy properties and one by black - hole mass , selection bias can also arise if the two samples are selected in the same way but are centered on different black - hole mass ranges .",
    "we further note that selection effects in these samples are difficult to model  for example , ( i ) as @xcite point out , the agn variability timescale depends on luminosity , and if the timescale is too long , reverberation mapping is impractical ; ( ii ) to be able to measure the velocity dispersion requires some minimum ratio of the luminosity of the host galaxy to the luminosity of the agn . if we make the simplest possible assumption , that the samples of nearby galaxies are complete but flux - limited , then equation ( [ eq : fluxlim ] ) implies @xmath180 .",
    "@xcite , building on the initial work of @xcite , examine a sample of 14 seyfert 1 galaxies at @xmath181 , measuring the velocity dispersions from stellar absorption lines and the black - hole masses by the photoionization method .",
    "compared to the local sample of inactive galaxies with measured black - hole masses , they find @xmath16 ; note that this result is based on a calibration of the photoionization masses that _ assumes _ that the @xcite sample should have exactly the same @xmath0 relation as inactive galaxies , which need not be the case if selection bias is accounted for .",
    "@xcite argue that their offset @xmath20 is robust because the black - hole masses are measured by the same technique , with the same calibration , in the local and high - redshift samples , but the selection bias in the two samples is likely to be quite different ; the @xcite sample is more nearly flux - limited , while the @xcite sample is more nearly luminosity - limited , and the selection bias in these two cases is quite different ( eqs .  [ eq : fluxlim ] and [ eq : biasone ] ) .",
    "a useful next step in assessing the bias would be to determine the luminosity function for agn selected by the criteria used by @xcite , for use in equation ( [ eq : biasone ] )",
    ".    it may also be significant that the typical @xmath182 in the @xcite sample is roughly an order of magnitude less massive than the typical @xmath183 in the @xcite sample .",
    "as is evident in figure [ fig : bh_bias ] , the bias is a strong function of @xmath2 and indeed the bias in the @xmath0 relation changes sign at @xmath184 .",
    "thus we would expect that selection bias might affect the results even if the @xcite sample were chosen in precisely the same way as the @xcite sample .",
    "figure [ fig : bh_bias ] predicts a bias of @xmath185 at @xmath183 for @xmath186 .",
    "this is only 40% of the offset claimed by @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that selection bias can not explain all or even most of the @xcite @xmath187 ; however , given the uncertainties discussed in the previous section , the possibility that the correction may be as large as the claimed offset can not be ruled out .",
    "@xcite find @xmath19 compared to the local @xmath1 relation , using a sample of 11 quasars at @xmath23 ; the black - hole masses are determined with the photoionization method .",
    "if we assume that the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy does not change between @xmath188 and @xmath14 , and that the luminosity of the host fades by 12 magnitudes as predicted by passive stellar evolution , then this result corresponds to @xmath1890.8 as measured by the @xmath0 relation . however , the potential selection bias is rather large for this sample , partly because the cosmic scatter in the @xmath1 relation may be larger than in the @xmath0 relation .",
    "if the sample is luminosity limited , the model shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : bh_bias ] predicts @xmath190 for @xmath79 for the range of black - hole masses in the sample , and the flux - limited model predicts @xmath191 for @xmath79 ( note that our assumption of a euclidean metric is not valid at @xmath188 , and should be generalized to a realistic cosmological model ) .",
    "a further complication is that their method requires measuring the bulge luminosity in the presence of the bright agn , so imposes a selection on the ratio of agn to galaxy luminosity . without an accurate estimate of the selection bias for the @xcite sample",
    ", their measurement of @xmath192 does not provide clear evidence for rapid evolution in the ratio of black - hole mass to stellar mass in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite find that galaxies of a given dispersion at @xmath12 have black - hole masses that are larger by @xmath193 than at @xmath194 .",
    "in contrast to most other studies , they carefully consider the effects of selection bias using monte - carlo models and conclude that for @xmath104 selection bias increases @xmath24 by @xmath195 at low redshift and @xmath196 at @xmath12 , contributing a net offset of @xmath197 .",
    "they also argue that scatter in the relationship between the width of the [ o iii ] emission line and the true stellar dispersion contributes an additional offset of @xmath198 , so after correcting for these biases @xmath13 .",
    "their estimates of selection bias are similar to , but somewhat smaller than , the bias that we estimate for their sample from equations ( [ eq : biasone ] ) and ( [ eq : fluxlim ] ) , assuming that the low - redshift sample is flux - limited and the high - redshift sample is luminosity - limited ; we believe our estimates are more robust because they do not depend on an assumed form for the distribution @xmath132 of agn luminosities at a given black - hole mass .",
    "finally , we note that theoretical models of the evolution of the @xmath0 relation @xcite predict @xmath199 at @xmath200 .",
    "strong selection bias could reduce or eliminate the difference between this prediction and the positive values of @xmath20 found at high redshift in most of the above studies .",
    "we have described a selection bias that affects investigations into the cosmological evolution of the @xmath0 or @xmath1 relations .",
    "we summarize the main points as follows :    * cosmic scatter in the @xmath0 or @xmath1 relations means that a galaxy of given @xmath9 or @xmath10 will host black holes with a range of @xmath3 values . *",
    "the steep decline in the luminosity function for the most luminous galaxies means that the rare occurrence of high - mass black holes in numerous `` modest '' galaxies overwhelms the frequent occurrence of black holes of similar mass in the rare galaxies with very high luminosity .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to dispersion instead of luminosity . *",
    "selection of a sample of black holes hosted by inactive galaxies at low redshift explores the distribution of black - hole masses @xmath3 that a galaxy will host , given its luminosity @xmath9 or dispersion @xmath5 selection of a sample by agn luminosity at high redshift explores the distribution of @xmath9 or @xmath10 at a given @xmath3 ( if , as is likely , the distribution of agn luminosity is determined mainly by the black - hole mass rather than the galaxy properties ) .",
    "confusing the two distributions may create a false signature of evolution .",
    "* the selection bias is substantial for the current estimates of the cosmic scatter in the @xmath1 or @xmath0 relations , particularly for galaxies containing the most massive black holes .",
    "neither the root - mean - square cosmic scatter nor the shape of the scatter function is known accurately and hence the bias can not be reliably corrected for , given our present and even foreseeable state of knowledge . * our rough estimates of selection bias as applied to a number of evolutionary studies show that the potential bias may be larger than many of the @xmath201 or @xmath202 values observed . with the notable exceptions of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", it appears that most studies of the evolution of the @xmath3 relations have not considered the effects of selection bias . in most cases ,",
    "accounting properly for selection bias is likely to reduce the the evolution in the @xmath3 relations that has been observed in recent surveys . *",
    "the only way to avoid selection bias is to choose high- and low - redshift galaxy samples using precisely defined , objective criteria that are precisely the same for the two samples . to our knowledge , this has not yet been done .",
