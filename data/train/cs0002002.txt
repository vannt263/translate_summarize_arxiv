    "due to their applications in knowledge representation and , more specifically , in commonsense reasoning , abduction , diagnosis , belief revision , planning and reasoning about action , default and autoepistemic logics are among the most extensively studied nonmonotonic formalisms .",
    "still , after almost two decades of research in the area several key questions remain open .",
    "the first of them is the question of the relationship between default and autoepistemic logics .",
    "default logic was introduced by reiter @xcite to formalize reasoning about defaults , that is , statements that describe what _ normally _ is the case , in the absence of contradicting information .",
    "autoepistemic logic was proposed by moore @xcite to describe the belief states of rational agents reflecting upon their own beliefs and disbeliefs .",
    "although the motivation and syntax of both logics are different , it has been clear for a long time that they are closely related .",
    "however , despite much work @xcite no truly satisfactory account of the relationship was found .",
    "konolige @xcite related default logic to a version of autoepistemic logic based on the notion of a _ strongly grounded expansion _  a concept that depends on a syntactic representation of a theory .",
    "marek and truszczynski related default logic to two modal nonmonotonic logics related but different from autoepistemic logic : the nonmonotonic modal logic * n * @xcite and nonmonotonic modal logic * s4f * @xcite . finally , gottlob @xcite found a relationship between default and autoepistemic logics but the translation he used was not modular .",
    "in fact , he proved that a modular translation of default logic into autoepistemic logic does not exist .",
    "these results seem to point to some misalignment between extensions of default theories and expansions of modal theories .",
    "our results in this paper finally clarify the picture .",
    "another problem is related to the fixpoint definitions of extensions ( in the case of default logic ) and expansions ( in the case of autoepistemic logic ) .",
    "they provide no insights into constructive processes agents might use to build their belief sets based on default or modal theories describing base facts .",
    "finally , there is a problem of high computational complexity of reasoning with extensions and expansions .",
    "the problems to decide the existence of an extension ( expansion ) is @xmath0-complete , the problem to compute the intersection of extensions ( expansions )  it is needed for skeptical reasoning  is @xmath1-hard .    in this paper",
    "we develop a unifying semantic treatment of default and autoepistemic logics and use it to address the three issues discussed above . for each logic",
    "we define a family of 2- , 3- and 4-valued semantics and show that they include all major semantics for default and autoepistemic logics . within our framework",
    "we define semantics that generalize kripke - kleene and well - founded semantics for logic programs .",
    "these semantics allow us to approximate skeptical default and autoepistemic reasoning and they can be computed faster than extensions and expansions ( assuming that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse ) .",
    "most importantly , we show that the unified semantic picture of default and autoepistemic logics described here allows us to pinpoint the exact nature of how they are related .",
    "our approach is motivated by the algebraic approach proposed by fitting in his analysis of semantics for logic programs with negation @xcite , and extends our earlier work on 3-valued semantics for autoepistemic logics @xcite .",
    "it relies on the concept of a _ belief pair _ , a pair @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are sets of 2-valued interpretations .",
    "the concept of a belief pair generalizes the notion of a _ possible - world structure _ , that is , a set of 2-valued interpretations , often used to define the semantics of the modal logic s5 and also used by moore and levesque @xcite in their work on autoepistemic logic .",
    "specifically , each possible - world structure @xmath5 can be identified with a belief pair @xmath6 .",
    "belief pairs allow us to approximate the state of beliefs of an agent whose beliefs are represented by a possible - world structure .",
    "given a possible - world structure @xmath5 or a belief pair @xmath7 , it is often possible to describe a way in which @xmath5 ( or @xmath7 ) could be revised to more accurately reflect the agent s beliefs .",
    "such a revision procedure can be formally described by an operator .",
    "fixpoints of such operators are often used to specify semantics of nonmonotonic formalisms as they represent those belief states of the agent that can not be revised away .",
    "sometimes fixpoints that satisfy some minimality conditions are additionally distinguished .",
    "these intuitions underlie the original definition of an _ expansion _ of a modal theory @xmath8 as a fixpoint of a certain operator @xmath9 on the set of all possible - world structures @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the operator @xmath9 can be extended to the set of belief pairs . the resulting operator , @xmath10 , yields a multi - valued generalization of expansions and a semantics that approximates skeptical autoepistemic reasoning .",
    "we refer to it as the kripke - kleene semantics as it generalizes kripke - kleene semantics for logic programs . in this paper , we derive from the operator @xmath10 two new operators and show that their fixpoints give rise to semantics for autoepistemic theories under which circular dependence of beliefs upon themselves , present in autoepistemic logic of moore , is eliminated .",
    "one of these semantics is shown to correspond to reiter s semantics of default logic .",
    "the other one can be viewed as a generalization of the well - founded semantics .    while possible - world semantics were used in the study of autoepistemic logic",
    ", they had only a marginal effect on the development of default logic . in this paper , we show that possible - world semantics approach can be extended to the case of default logic .",
    "namely , in a close analogy with autoepistemic logic , for every default theory @xmath11 , we introduce an operator @xmath12 defined on the set of belief pairs .",
    "we show that the operator @xmath12 gives rise to three other operators and that the fixpoints of these operators yield several semantics for default theories . among these semantics",
    "are the semantics of extensions by reiter , the stationary semantics @xcite , the well - founded semantics for default logic @xcite ( it approximates skeptical reasoning under extensions ) , the semantics of weak extensions @xcite and the kripke - kleene semantics ( it approximates skeptical reasoning under weak extensions ) .",
    "our results settle the issue of the relationship between autoepistemic and default logics .",
    "we show that the operators @xmath12 and @xmath10 are closely related if a default theory @xmath11 is interpreted as a modal theory @xmath8 given by the translation proposed by konolige @xcite .",
    "our results show that under the konolige s translation , the _ families _ of semantics for default and autoepistemic logics are isomorphic and default logic can be viewed , as has long been expected , as a fragment of autoepistemic logic . but this correspondence does not relate extensions and expansions ! the semantics corresponding to these concepts occupy different locations in their respective families of semantics and have different properties .",
    "we also point out that the kripke - kleene and well - founded semantics studied in the paper have better computational properties than the semantics of expansions and extensions .",
    "we conclude with comments about further generalizations and open problems .",
    "the formal language for the semantic study developed in this paper is that of lattices , operators and fixpoints .",
    "the key result is that by tarski and knaster @xcite stating that a monotone operator on a complete lattice has a least fixpoint .",
    "by @xmath13 we denote the set of atoms of the propositional language under consideration .",
    "the set of all 2-valued interpretations of @xmath13 will be denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "any set @xmath15 is called a _ possible - world _ structure and can be viewed as a universal kripke model @xcite .",
    "possible - world structures are a basic tool in semantic studies of modal logics .",
    "they were also used in the context of autoepistemic logic @xcite .",
    "a collection of all possible - world structures will be denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "this set can be ordered by the reverse set inclusion : for @xmath17 , @xmath18 if @xmath19 ( the smaller the set of possible worlds , the bigger the theory it determines ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath20 is a complete lattice . to study formalisms based on the modal language",
    ", we define the _ truth function _ @xmath21 inductively as follows ( @xmath5 is a possible - world structure , @xmath22 is an interpretation ) :    1 .",
    "@xmath23 , if @xmath24 is an atom 2 .",
    "boolean connectives are handled in the standard tarskian way 3 .",
    "@xmath25 , if for every interpretation @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , otherwise .",
    "the value of a modal atom @xmath29 given by @xmath21 does not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "thus , it is determined only by the possible - world structure in question .",
    "it is clear that the _ meta - knowledge _ specified by a possible - world structure @xmath5 is complete : all modal atoms @xmath29 are either true or false with respect to @xmath5 .    for every modal theory @xmath8 ,",
    "moore @xcite defined an operator @xmath9 on @xmath16 by : @xmath31 moore called the theory of a fixpoint of @xmath9 an _ expansion _ will be referred to as expansions , as well . ] .    in @xcite ,",
    "moore s approach was extended to the 3-valued case , in which a possibility of incomplete meta - knowledge is admitted .",
    "a key concept is that of a _ belief pair _ , that is , a pair @xmath2 of possible - world structures . in a belief pair @xmath2",
    ", @xmath3 can be viewed as a representation of a conservative ( pessimistic ) view on what is believed while @xmath4 can be regarded as a representation of a liberal ( gullible ) view .",
    "if @xmath32 , formulas believed in according to the conservative view captured by @xmath3 , are believed in according to the liberal view represented by @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , a belief pair @xmath2 such that @xmath32 is called _",
    "consistent_. however , the ways in which the agent establishes the estimates @xmath3 and @xmath4 may be independent of each other and , thus , we allow belief pairs @xmath2 such that @xmath4 is not a subset of @xmath3",
    ". we refer to them as _",
    "inconsistent_. in applications we are mostly interested in consistent belief pairs .",
    "constructive techniques for building belief pairs given a base theory , which are described in the paper , result in consistent belief pairs .",
    "however , admitting inconsistent belief pairs completes the picture , leads to simple intuitions behind mathematical arguments and results in more elegant algebraic structures .    with a belief pair @xmath2 and a 2-valued interpretation",
    "@xmath30 we associate a 2-valued truth function @xmath33 defined on a modal language . the idea is to define @xmath34 so that it provides a conservative estimate to the truth value of @xmath35 with respect to a belief pair @xmath2 . since @xmath3 represents a conservative point of view and @xmath4 a liberal one , to get a conservative estimate we use @xmath3 to evaluate positive occurrences of modal atoms and @xmath4 to evaluate negative ones .",
    "the definition is inductive :    1 .",
    "@xmath36 , for every atom @xmath24 2 .",
    "conjunction and disjunction are treated in the standard tarskian way 3 .",
    "@xmath37 4 .",
    "@xmath38 if @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 , otherwise .",
    "we stress that when evaluating the negation of a formula the roles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are switched , which ensures that modal literals appearing positively in a formula are evaluated with respect to @xmath3 while those appearing negatively are evaluated with respect to @xmath4 .    clearly , to construct a liberal estimate for the truth value of @xmath35 with respect to a belief pair",
    "@xmath2 we can proceed similarly and use @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) to evaluate modal literals appearing positively ( negatively ) in @xmath35 .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that the resulting truth function can be expressed as @xmath42 ( we reverse the roles of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "conservative and liberal estimates of truth values of formulas can be combined into a single _ 4-valued _ estimate .",
    "we say that the logical value of a formula @xmath35 is true , @xmath43 ( false , @xmath44 ) , if both conservative and liberal estimates of its truth value are equal to @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",

    "finally , the logical value of @xmath35 is _ inconsistent _ , @xmath48 , if the conservative estimate is @xmath45 and the liberal estimate is @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the estimates given by @xmath34 and @xmath49 yield a 4-valued truth function @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "@xmath29 the two estimates may disagree ( @xmath29 may be assigned value @xmath47 or @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , it is easy to see , that for a complete belief pair @xmath55 , @xmath56 , for every interpretation @xmath22 . in other words , belief pairs and the truth function @xmath57 generalize possible - world structures and the truth function @xmath58 . in addition , for a consistent belief pair @xmath2 , @xmath57 never assigns value @xmath48 and coincides with the 3-valued truth function defined in @xcite .",
