    "recently meyer et al . @xcite carried out high - precision measurements of the total cross sections near threshold for the reaction @xmath1 these measurements were confirmed by bondar et al . @xcite .",
    "the early theoretical calculations @xcite underestimate these s - wave @xmath2 production cross sections by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "the basic features of these early calculations may be summarized as follows .",
    "the pion production reactions are assumed to be described by the single nucleon process ( the born term ) , fig.1(a ) , and the @xmath4-wave pion rescattering process , fig.1(b ) .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath6 vertex for the born term is assumed to be given by the pseudovector interaction hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the axial coupling constant , and @xmath9 = 93 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "the first term represents @xmath10-wave pion - nucleon coupling , while the second term accounts for the nucleon recoil effect and makes @xmath11  galilean - invariant \" . for @xmath4-wave pion production",
    "only the second term contributes . since this second term is smaller than the first term by a factor of @xmath12 , the contribution of the born term to @xmath4-wave pion production",
    "is intrinsically suppressed , and as a consequence the process becomes sensitive to two - body contributions , fig.1(b ) .",
    "the s - wave rescattering vertex in fig.1(b ) is commonly calculated using the phenomenological hamiltonian @xcite @xmath13 the two coupling constants @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 in eq.([h1 ] ) were determined from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 pion nucleon scattering lengths @xmath18 and @xmath19 as    [ eq:4 ] @xmath20",
    "@xmath21    the current algebra prediction @xcite for the scattering lengths , @xmath22 , implies that only chiral symmetry breaking terms will give a non - vanishing value of the coupling constant @xmath14 in eq.([h1 ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath14 is expected to be very small .",
    "indeed , the empirical values @xmath23 and @xmath24 obtained by hhler _ et al._@xcite lead to @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "so the contribution of the @xmath14 term in eq.([h1 ] ) is significantly suppressed .",
    "meanwhile , although @xmath15 is much larger than @xmath14 , the isospin structure of the @xmath15 term is such that it can not contribute to the @xmath2 production from two protons at the rescattering vertex in fig.1(b ) .",
    "thus , the use of the phenomenological hamiltonians , eqs.([h0 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) , to calculate the born term and the rescattering terms illustrated in figs.1(a ) and ( b ) , gives significantly suppressed cross sections for the @xmath0 reaction near threshold .",
    "therefore , theoretically calculated cross sections can be highly sensitive to any deviations from this conventional treatment .",
    "these delicate features should be kept in mind in discussing the large discrepancy ( a factor of @xmath35 ) between the observed cross sections and the predictions of the earlier calculations .",
    "a plausible mechanism to increase the theoretical cross section was suggested by lee and riska@xcite .",
    "they proposed to supplement the contribution of the pion - exchange diagram , fig.1(b ) , with the contributions of the short - range axial - charge exchange operators which were directly related to heavy - meson exchanges in the nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite . according to lee and riska , the shorter - range meson exchanges ( scalar and vector exchange contributions )",
    "can enhance the cross section by a factor 35 .",
    "subsequently , horowitz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated , for the bonn meson exchange potential , a prominent role of the @xmath27 meson in enhancing the cross section , thereby basically confirming the conclusions of lee and riska .",
    "the possible importance of heavy - meson exchanges may be inferred from the following simple argument .",
    "consider fig.1(b ) in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system with the initial and final interactions turned off and with the exchanged particle allowed to be any particle ( not necessarily a pion ) . at threshold , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , so that any exchanged particle must have @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 mev / c , which implies @xmath33 .",
    "thus the rescattering process probes two - nucleon forces at distances @xmath3 0.5 fm corresponding to a typical effective exchanged mass @xmath34 mev .",
    "its sensitivity to the intermediate - range @xmath6-@xmath6 forces indicates the possible importance of the two - body heavy meson axial exchange currents considered by lee and riska .",
    "the particular kinematical situation we considered here shall be referred to as the _ typical threshold kinematics_.    meanwhile , hernndez and oset @xcite considered the _ off - shell _ dependence of the @xmath35 @xmath4-wave isoscalar amplitude featuring in the rescattering process , fig.1(b ) .",
    "they pointed out that the @xmath4-wave amplitude could be appreciably enhanced for off - shell kinematics pertinent to the rescattering process .",
    "we have seen above that , for the _ typical threshold kinematics _ , the exchanged pion can indeed be far off - shell .",
    "the actual kinematics of course may deviate from the _ typical threshold kinematics _ rather significantly due to energy - momentum exchanges between the two nucleons in the initial and final states , but the importance of the off - shell kinematics for the exchanged pion is likely to persist .",
    "hernndez and oset examined two types of off - shell extrapolation : ( i ) the hamilton model for @xmath35 isoscalar amplitude based on @xmath27-exchange plus a short range piece@xcite , and ( ii ) an extrapolation based on the current algebra constraints . in either case the enhancement of the total cross section due to the rescattering process was estimated to be strong enough to reproduce the experimental data . a more detailed momentum - space calculation carried out by hanhart _",
    "et al._@xcite supports the significant enhancement due to an off - shell effect in the rescattering process , although the enhancement is not large enough to explain the experimental data .",
    "it should be emphasized that hanhart _",
    "s calculation eliminates many of the kinematical approximations employed in the previous calculations .",
    "given these developments based on the phenomenological lagrangians , we consider it important to examine the significance of these phenomenological lagrangians in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath36pt ) @xcite which in general serves as a guiding principle for low - energy hadron dynamics .",
    "in the present work we shall describe an attempt at relating the traditional phenomenological approaches to @xmath36pt .",
    "the fact that @xmath36pt accounts for and improves the results of the current algebra also makes it a natural framework for studying threshold pion production .",
    "furthermore , in this low - energy regime , it is natural to employ the heavy - fermion formalism ( hff)@xcite .",
    "the hff has an additional advantage of allowing easy comparison with eqs.([h0 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the application of @xmath36pt to nuclei involves some subtlety . as emphasized by weinberg @xcite ,",
    "naive chiral counting fails for a nucleus , which is a loosely bound many - body system .",
    "this is because purely nucleonic intermediate states occurring in a nucleus can have very low excitation energies , which spoils the ordinary chiral counting . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", one must first classify diagrams appearing in perturbation series into irreducible and reducible diagrams , according to whether or not a diagram is free from purely nucleonic intermediate states .",
    "thus , in an irreducible diagram , every intermediate state contains at least one meson .",
    "the @xmath36pt can be safely applied to the irreducible diagrams .",
    "the contribution of all the irreducible diagrams ( up to a specified chiral order ) is then to be used as an effective operator acting on the nucleonic hilbert space .",
    "this second step allows us to incorporate the contributions of the reducible diagrams",
    ". we may refer to this two - step procedure as the _ nuclear chiral perturbation theory _ ( nuclear @xmath36pt ) .",
    "this method was first applied by weinberg @xcite to chiral - perturbation - theoretical derivation of the nucleon - nucleon interactions and subsequently used by van kolck _ et al .",
    "park , min and rho ( pmr ) @xcite applied the nuclear @xmath36pt to meson exchange currents in nuclei .",
    "the success of the nuclear @xmath36pt in describing the exchange currents for the electromagnetic and weak interactions is well known @xcite .",
    "the present paper is in the spirit of the work of pmr .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in the next section we define our pion field and the chiral counting procedure . then in section",
    "iii we present the two lowest order lagrangians , discuss their connection to the early works on this reaction and determine within certain approximations the numerical values of the effective pion rescattering vertex strength , @xmath37 . in section iv we briefly discuss the connection between the transition matrix for this reaction and the @xmath36pt calculated amplitude . in section v we present necessary loop corrections to the born term , and in section vi we calculate the cross section and discuss the various approximations and the uncertainties of the low energy constants in @xmath36pt . finally in section vii , after discussing some higher chiral order diagrams , we present our main conclusions .    a work very similar in spirit to ours has recently been completed by cohen _ et al._@xcite .",
    "the effective chiral lagrangian @xmath38 involves an su(2 ) matrix @xmath39 that is non - linearly related to the pion field and that has standard chiral transformation properties @xcite .",
    "an example is @xcite @xmath40 ^ 2 } + i\\bbox{\\tau } \\!\\cdot\\ !",
    "\\label{eq : uuu}\\ ] ] in the meson sector , the sum of chiral - invariant monomials constructed from @xmath39 and its derivatives constitutes the chiral - symmetric part of @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , one can construct systematically the symmetry - breaking part of @xmath38 with the use of a mass matrix @xmath41 the chiral transformation of which is dictated by that of the quark mass term in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "to each term appearing in @xmath38 one can assign a chiral order index @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the summed power of the derivative and the pion mass involved in this term .",
    "a low energy phenomenon is characterized by a generic pion momentum @xmath45 , which is small compared to the chiral scale @xmath46 1 gev .",
    "it can be shown that the contribution of a term of chiral order @xmath42 carry a factor @xmath47 , where @xmath48 represents either @xmath45 or the pion mass @xmath49 .",
    "this suggests the possibility of describing low - energy phenomena in terms of @xmath38 that contains only a manageably limited number of terms of low chiral order .",
    "this is the basic idea of @xmath36pt .",
    "the heavy fermion formalism ( hff)@xcite allows us to easily extend @xmath36pt to the meson - nucleon system . in hff , the ordinary dirac field @xmath50 describing the nucleon , is replaced by the heavy nucleon field @xmath51 and the accompanying  small component field \" @xmath52 through the transformation    @xmath53 \\label{n}\\ ] ]    with @xmath54 where the four - velocity @xmath55 is assumed to be almost static , i.e. , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "elimination of @xmath52 in favor of @xmath51 leads to expansion in @xmath57 . since @xmath58 1 gev @xmath59 , an expansion in @xmath57 may be treated like an expansion in @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath38 in hff consists of chiral symmetric monomials constructed from @xmath39 , @xmath51 and their derivatives and of symmetry - breaking terms involving @xmath41 .",
    "the chiral order @xmath42 in hff is defined by @xmath61 where @xmath44 is , as before , the summed power of the derivative and the pion mass , while @xmath62 is the number of nucleon fields involved in a given term . as before , a term in @xmath38 with chiral order @xmath42 can be shown to carry a factor @xmath63 . in what follows , @xmath42 stands for the chiral order defined in eq.([eq : nubar2 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the chiral order index @xmath42 defined for each term in @xmath38 , we assign a chiral order index @xmath64 for each irreducible feynman diagram appearing in the chiral perturbation series for a multifermion system @xcite .",
    "its definition is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of nucleons in the feynman diagram , @xmath67 the number of loops , and @xmath68 the number of disconnected parts of the diagram .",
    "the sum over @xmath69 runs over all the vertices in the feynman graph , and @xmath70 is the chiral order of each vertex .",
    "one can show @xcite that an irreducible diagram of chiral order @xmath64 carries a factor @xmath71 .    in the literature the term  effective lagrangian \" ( or  effective hamiltonian \" ) is often used to imply that that lagrangian ( or hamiltonian ) is only meant for calculating tree diagrams .",
    "the hamiltonians given in eqs.([h0 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) are regarded as effective hamiltonians of this type .",
    "we must note , however , that the effective lagrangian in @xmath36pt has a different meaning .",
    "not only can @xmath38 be used beyond tree approximation but , in fact , a consistent chiral counting even demands inclusion of every loop diagram whose chiral order @xmath64 is lower than or equal to the chiral order of interest . as will be discussed below , for a consistent @xmath36pt treatment of the problem at hand ,",
    "we therefore need to consider loop corrections",
    ". however , since the inclusion of the loop corrections is rather technical , we find it useful to first concentrate on the tree - diagram contributions .",
    "this simplification allows us to understand the basic aspects of the relation between the contributions from @xmath36pt and the phenomenological hamiltonians , eqs.([h0 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the next two sections ( iii and iv ) we limit our discussion to tree diagrams . a more elaborate treatment including loop corrections",
    "will be described in section v.",
    "in order to produce the one - body and two - body diagrams depicted in figs.1(a ) and 1(b ) , we minimally need ( see below ) terms with @xmath72 and @xmath73 in @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore work with    @xmath74    where @xmath75 represents terms of chiral order @xmath42 .",

    "( the explicit expressions will be given below . )",
    "it should be noted that in hff , a part of the term in @xmath83 with the coefficient @xmath91 , namely the @xmath92 piece , represents the @xmath4-wave @xmath5-@xmath6 scattering contribution , which in a traditional calculation is obtained from the crossed born - term .    the four - fermi non - derivative contact terms in eq.([eq:11 ] ) were introduced by weinberg @xcite and further investigated in two- and three - nucleon systems by van kolck _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "although these terms are important in the chiral perturbative derivation of the nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite , they do not play a major role in the following discussion of the threshold @xmath0 reaction .",
    "we therefore temporarily ignore these four - fermion terms and come back to a discussion of these terms in the last section .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) leads to the pion - nucleon interaction hamiltonian    @xmath93    where    [ eq:17 ] @xmath94 n    + \\frac{1}{4f_\\pi^2 } \\bar{n } \\bbox{\\tau}\\!\\cdot\\!\\bbox{\\pi } \\!\\times\\!\\dot{\\bbox{\\pi } }",

    "we now compare @xmath97 resulting from @xmath36pt , eq.([hint ] ) with the phenomenological effective hamiltonian @xmath98 , eqs.([h0 ] ) and ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "( the reader is reminded that the chiral index @xmath42 should not be confused with the suffix appearing in @xmath11 and @xmath99 . ) regarding the @xmath100 vertices , we note that the first term in @xmath101 and the first term in @xmath102 exactly correspond to the first and second terms , respectively , in @xmath11 .",

    "now , for _ on - shell _ low energy pion - nucleon scattering ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , @xmath122 , we equate    @xmath123    where @xmath124 from eq.([eq:20 ] ) we have @xmath125   -\\frac{g_a^2}{8m_n } , \\label{eq : cctilde1}\\ ] ] which results in @xmath126 the above cited empirical value for @xmath127 leads to @xmath128 we now interpret these results in terms of @xmath14 of eq.([h1 ] ) .",
    "conventionally , @xmath14 is determined from eq.([eq4a ] ) which is the first term in eq.([eq : kappa1 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath129 which gives @xmath130 or @xmath131 .",
    "this is the ",
    "standard value \" used in the literature @xcite . on the other hand , the r.h.s . of eq.([eq : onshell ] ) based on @xmath36pt gives from eq.([eq : kappa2 ] ) @xmath132 which is about twice as large as the conventional value .",
    "this means the second term in eq.([eq : kappa1 ] ) is almost as large as the first term .",
    "thus @xmath36pt leads to a substantial modification of the commonly used formula , eq.([eq4a ] ) or eq.([eqll ] ) .",
    "this large  higher chiral order \" corrections due to @xmath121 [ the term proportional to @xmath119 in eq.([eq : kappa1 ] ) ] indicates that @xmath36pt does not converge very rapidly in this particular case .",
    "this apparent lack of convergence is probably due to the fact that the first terms in expansion , the @xmath5-@xmath6 isoscalar scattering length @xmath127 , is exceptionally small .    to develop further the connection between the traditional and the @xmath36pt approaches , we return to a discussion of eq.([eq : kappakq ] )",
    "obviously , the constant @xmath14 can not be fully identified with @xmath133 which depends on the momenta @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "in fact , the momentum dependence of @xmath133 should play a significant role in describing the physical pion - nucleon elastic scattering process where @xmath136 , @xmath137 .",
    "an additional crucial point in the present context is that , in the rescattering diagram fig.1(b ) , the exchanged pion can be far off - shell , and therefore the @xmath134 and @xmath135 dependence in @xmath133 may play an even more pronounced role . as an illustration , let us consider again the _ typical threshold kinematics _ discussed in the introduction : @xmath138 and @xmath139 . if we denote by @xmath37 the value of @xmath133 [ eq.([eq : kappakq ] ) ] corresponding to the _ typical threshold kinematics _ , we have @xmath140 \\label{eq : kappath}\\ ] ] the use of the central values for the coupling constants @xmath84 and @xmath85 leads to @xmath141 thus the strength of the @xmath4-wave pion - nucleon interaction here is much stronger than the on - shell cases , see eqs.([lambdaold ] ) and ( [ eq : lambda1c ] ) , and the sign of the off - shell coupling strength is _ opposite _ to the on - shell cases .",
    "the first feature is qualitatively in line with the observation of hernndez and oset@xcite that the rescattering term should be larger than previously considered .",
    "however , the sign of the typical off - shell coupling in our case [ eq.([kappath1 ] ) ] is opposite to the one used in ref.@xcite .",
    "as will be discussed later , this flip of the sign drastically changes the pattern of interplay between the born and rescattering terms .",
    "we must emphasize that the off - shell enhancement depends strongly on the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which , as discussed in ref.@xcite , are not known very accurately .",
    "it is therefore important to examine to what extent the existing large ambiguities in @xmath84 and @xmath85 affect the off - shell enhancement of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "we shall address this question in section vi .",
    "as explained earlier , in the nuclear @xmath36pt we first use @xmath36pt to calculate the contributions of the irreducible diagrams .",
    "let @xmath143 represent the contributions of all irreducible diagrams ( up to a specified chiral order @xmath64 ) for the @xmath0 process .",
    "then we use @xmath143 as an effective transition operator in the hilbert space of nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "consequently , the two - nucleon transition matrix element @xmath144 for the @xmath0 process is given by    @xmath145    where @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) is the initial ( final ) two - nucleon state distorted by the initial - state ( final - state ) interaction .",
    "these distorted waves should be obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with nucleon - nucleon interactions generated by irreducible diagrams pertinent to nucleon - nucleon scattering , thereby incorporating an infinite number of  reducible \" ladder diagrams . in this section",
    "we concentrate on the derivation of the transition operator @xmath143 , relegating the discussion of @xmath144 and eq.([eq : tmatrix ] ) to section vi .",
    "we decompose @xmath143 as    @xmath148    where @xmath149 represents the contribution from feynman diagrams of chiral order @xmath64 , as defined in eq.([eq : nununu ] ) .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath64 occurs for the born term shown in fig.2(a ) . for @xmath4-wave @xmath5 production at threshold the @xmath150 vertex with @xmath151 , the first term in eq.([hint ] ) , can not contribute ; hence the lowest @xmath42 for @xmath150 vertex involving an external pion must be @xmath72 . the first term in eq.([eq : hint1 ] )",
    "provides this vertex . according to eq.([eq : nununu ] ) , the chiral order of fig.2(a ) is given by @xmath152 as can be checked easily , there are no diagrams with @xmath153 since in the rescattering diagram , fig.2(b ) , the second term in eq.([eq : hint0 ] ) , which gives the @xmath154 vertex with @xmath151 , is not operative here due to the isospin selection rule .",
    "the rescattering diagram in fig.2(b ) with the indicated value of @xmath42 at each vertex contributes to @xmath155 .",
    "it should be noted that because of the @xmath156 term in the chiral counting expression , eq.([eq : nununu ] ) , exchange - current - type diagrams such as fig.2(b ) give higher values of @xmath64 . in this work",
    "we truncate the calculation of the transition operator @xmath143 at @xmath157 thus ,    @xmath158    the above enumeration is , as briefly discussed in section iii , far from complete because loop diagrams and counter terms and finite terms from @xmath121 have been left out . in fig.3",
    "we show the loop corrections to the born term [ fig.2(a ) ] .",
    "the diagrams in fig.3 all have @xmath159 and hence are of the same chiral order as the leading order rescattering diagram , fig.2(b ) . as discussed earlier , for the @xmath0 reaction at threshold the contribution of the born term is numerically suppressed so that the rescattering diagram , which is formally of higher chiral order by two units of @xmath64 , plays an essential role .",
    "this implies that a meaningful and consistent @xmath36pt calculation of this reaction must include the loop corrections to the leading - order born term .",
    "however , we continue to postpone the discussion of loop corrections to the next section .    the tree diagrams contributing to eq.([eq : calttrunc ] ) , figs.2(a ) and 2(b ) , are as follows .",
    "the born term , fig.2(a ) , contributes to @xmath160 and the rescattering term , fig.2(b ) , contributes to @xmath161 .",
    "these contributions are given , respectively , by    [ eq:35 ] @xmath162 @xmath163    where @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) denote the initial and final momenta of the @xmath69-th proton , @xmath167 ; and @xmath168 is as defined in eq.([eq : kappakq ] ) .",
    "we have emphasized above that the loop corrections to the born diagram , fig.2(a ) , which has chiral order @xmath169 , are of the same chiral order @xmath170 as the two - body pion rescattering process , fig.2(b ) .",
    "these loop corrections therefore must be included in a consistent @xmath171 calculation .    for our present purposes",
    "it is not necessary to go into a general discussion of the renormalization of the parameters in @xmath172 .",
    "instead we concentrate on an estimation of the size of the finite loop corrections to the specific tree level terms shown in fig.2 .",

    "hanhart et al.@xcite made a critical study of the consequences of avoiding these kinematical approximations .",
    "they worked directly with the two - nucleon wavefunctions in momentum representation . in the present work we do not attempt at detailed momentum - space calculations and simply use the  conventional \" fourier transform method .",
    "because of this and a few other approximations adopted , the numerical work presented here is admittedly of exploratory nature .",
    "nonetheless , as we shall show , our semiquantitative study of @xmath144 based on the chiral - theoretically motived transition operator @xmath143 provide some valuable insight into the dynamics of the threshold @xmath0 reaction .",

    "correspondingly , the coupling strength @xmath133 [ eq.([tp1 ] ) ] is taken to be @xmath224gev@xmath225 [ eq.([kappath1 ] ) ] .",
    "subsequently , by liberating the momentum variables @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 from the on - mass - shell conditions ( @xmath230 ) , we treat @xmath231 as a function of @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229 .",

    "@xmath232 can be easily fourier transformed to give @xmath235 in @xmath218 representation .",
    "the simplified treatment described here , which is commonly used in the literature , shall be referred to as the _ fixed kinematics approximation_.    now , in the _ fixed kinematics approximation _ , @xmath143 [ eqs.([eq : calttrunc ] ) , ( [ eq:35 ] ) ] is translated into differential operators acting on relative coordinate of the two - nucleon wavefunctions :    [ eq:37 ] @xmath236 @xmath237    where the derivative operator with subscript @xmath238 is to act on the relative coordinate @xmath239 between two protons , and @xmath240 . the trivial isospin operator @xmath241 has been dropped . the yukawa function @xmath242 is defined with the _ effective _ mass @xmath243 .",
    "we reemphasize that the simple yukawa form @xmath244 arises only when the _ fixed kinematics approximation _ just discussed is used .",
    "from this point on , our calculation of @xmath144 follows exactly the traditional pattern described in the literature .",
    "thus @xmath144 is evaluated by inserting the transition operators , @xmath245 and @xmath235 , eq.([eq:37 ] ) , between the initial and final nuclear states @xmath246 where @xmath10 and @xmath247 are the asymptotic relative three - momenta of the initial and final two - proton systems .",
    "the wavefunctions are normalized as @xmath248 with @xmath249 being the @xmath6-@xmath6 scattering phase shifts . for simplicity , the coulomb interactions between the two protons is ignored .",
    "( the coulomb force is known to reduce the cross section up to 30%.@xcite . )",
    "the explicit expression for the transition amplitude at threshold is obtained as @xmath250 here , @xmath251 is the kinetic energy of the final state , and    [ eq:40 ] @xmath252 @xmath253    the total cross section is obtained by multiplying the absolute square of the transition amplitude ( averaged over the initial spins and summed over the final spins ) with the appropriate phase space factor @xmath254 and the flux factor @xmath255 : @xmath256    where @xmath257 is the scattering length of the @xmath258 potential .",
    "then the cross section can be simply expressed as    @xmath259    where    [ eq:44 ] @xmath260",
    "@xmath261    under the approximation ( [ aprx ] ) , the energy dependence of the cross section is solely given by @xmath262 , which incorporates the phase space and the final state interaction effect ( in the watson approximation@xcite ) .",
    "we have calculated the integrals @xmath263 and @xmath264 for representative nuclear potentials : the hamada - johnston ( hj ) potential@xcite , and the reid soft - core potential ( rsc)@xcite . the results are given in table i , and the corresponding cross sections are presented in table ii .",
    "these results indicate that , for the nuclear potentials considered here , the value of @xmath265 is much too small to reproduce the experimental cross section .",
    "if we define the discrepancy ratio @xmath266 by @xmath267 with @xmath268 taken from ref.@xcite , then @xmath269 ( @xmath270 ) for the hamada - johnston ( reid soft - core ) potential , and @xmath266 happens to be almost constant for the whole range of @xmath271 mev for which @xmath268 is known .",
    "thus , although the off - shell behavior of the @xmath4-wave pion scattering amplitude derived from the chiral lagrangian does enhance the contribution of the rescattering process over the value reported in the literature , the sign change that occurs in @xmath272 as one goes from @xmath273 [ eq.([eq : onshell ] ) ] to @xmath37 [ eq.([eq : kappath ] ) ] results in a significant cancelation between the born term @xmath263 and the rescattering term @xmath274 , leading to the very small cross sections in table ii @xcite .",
    "the drastic cancelation between @xmath263 and @xmath274 found here means that the calculated cross sections are highly sensitive to the various approximations used in our calculation and also to the precise values of the constants @xmath275 and @xmath85 of eq.([eq:20 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss these two questions in the next two paragraphs .",

    "in addition , although the loop corrections of chiral order @xmath64 = 1 , shown in fig.3(a ) , automatically introduces energy - momentum dependent vertices , we ignored this feature .",
    "the fact that the kinematics of the reaction eq.([eq : pppi ] ) requires highly off - shell vertices leads to the expectation that the vertex form factors can be very important and invalidate the _ threshold kinematics approximation _ leading to eq.([eq:37 ] ) . in this connection",
    "we note that a momentum - space calculation @xcite , which is free from this approximation , indicates that even a negative value of @xmath14 could lead to the moderate enhancement of the cross section .",
    "the strong cancelation between the born and rescattering terms also means that , even within the framework of the _ fixed kinematics approximation _ , the large errors that exist in the empirical value of @xmath127 and the @xmath275 and @xmath85 constants can influence the cross sections significantly . to assess this influence , we rewrite eq.([eq : kappath ] ) as @xmath276 the use of the experimental values for @xmath127 and @xmath277 quoted earlier leads to @xmath278 with this uncertainty taken into account , the ratio @xmath266 ranges from @xmath279 to @xmath280 for the hamada - johnston potential , and from @xmath281 to @xmath282 for the reid soft - core potential . to further examine the uncertainties in the @xmath83 constants we remark that the value of @xmath283 can be extracted from the known pion - nucleon effective range parameter @xmath284 .",
    "the low energy pion - nucleon scattering amplitude is expanded as : @xmath285 where * q * is the pion momentum and @xmath286 @xcite .",
    "if we use @xmath83 to calculate the s - wave pion - nucleon amplitude we find : @xmath287 and then eq.([eq : kappath ] ) leads to @xmath288 since @xmath85 is given directly by the experimental quantity @xmath89 [ eq.([c2 ] ) ] , we consider eq.([bplus ] ) as an alternative input to determine @xmath118 in terms of @xmath284 and @xmath85",
    ". then eqs.([bplus]),([c2 ] ) and the experimental value of @xmath284 @xcite give @xmath289 we note that this value is larger than the one given in eq.([c3 ] ) , indicating that the determination of @xmath118 requires further studies .",
    "with the new value of @xmath37 given in eq.([kappanew ] ) we find that the discrepancy ratio @xmath266 [ eq.([ratio ] ) ] can be as small as @xmath290 .",

    "in this work we have used @xmath36pt to calculate the effective pion - exchange current contribution to the @xmath294 reaction at threshold . as stated repeatedly ,",
    "our aim here is to carry out a systematic treatment of @xmath143 up to chiral order @xmath171 [ see eq.([eq : calttrunc ] ) ] .",
