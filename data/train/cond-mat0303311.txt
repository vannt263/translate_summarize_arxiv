    "doped manganites are strongly correlated electron systems with unusually large responses to external perturbations such as magnetic field and pressure . while the most dramatic effects such as colossal magnetoresistance have been observed in heavily - doped compounds , systematic studies on lightly and moderately - doped samples may reveal some fundamental aspects of manganite physics . in these regimes ,",

    "electron - doped camno@xmath2 samples are particularly attractive model systems due to the relative simplicity and chemical stability of the parent compound , which shows a simple quasi - cubic crystal structure and an isotropic @xmath8-afm spin ground state @xcite . for electron - doped camno@xmath2 ,",
    "a relatively weak ferromagnetism has been observed up to @xmath10 % doping @xcite . while the classic de gennes theory for lightly - doped manganites describes the weak ferromagnetism in terms of spin - canted ground states @xcite , a number of more recent theoretical studies",

    "in fact , for moderately hole - doped lamno@xmath2 ( @xmath11 % ca- or sr- doping ) , single crystal neutron - scattering studies revealed the existence of nanometric - scale magnetic inhomogeneities at low @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "whether electron - doped manganites actually mirror this effect is an open experimental problem and a fundamental issue , since the phase diagram of electron - doped manganites is in general asymmetrical with respect to their hole - doped counterparts .",

    "a combined analysis using high - resolution neutron and synchrotron x - ray diffraction data makes it clear that the @xmath63-afm magnetic reflections originate in crystallographic domains having a distinct ( monoclinic ) crystal structure due to the elongation of mno@xmath66 octahedra along the @xmath63-afm chain direction .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) shows in detail the peak intensity of the @xmath79 reflection .",
    "the observed increase of this peak intensity for increasing fields up to @xmath81 t indicates a reorientation of the fm spin - component along the field direction ( see above ) .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath78 peak decreases by 34(3 ) % in the same field range , indicating a perpendicular coupling between @xmath8-afm and fm spin components , consistent with @xmath8-afm + fm spin - canting .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath80 peak is insensitive to fields up to 7 t , showing that the @xmath63-afm spin component is not coupled to the fm spin component .",
    "thus , the results shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , combined with high - resolution diffraction data @xcite , suggest mesoscopic phase coexistence between c - afm regions with no fm moment and @xmath8-afm + fm state for @xmath82 .    for @xmath17 ,",
    "the field - induced reorientation of the very weak fm spin component was probed by dc - magnetization ( @xmath83 ) measurements , which were taken using a commercial squid magnetometer .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ mag](a ) shows the @xmath67-dependence of @xmath83 at 5 k. the curve can be decomposed into a fm signal which saturates at @xmath84/mn for fields smaller than 0.5 t , and a linear component which is tentatively ascribed to a conventional field - induced spin canting .",
    "the field - dependence of the @xmath8-afm spins for @xmath17 was probed by neutron diffraction ( see fig .",
    "[ mag](a ) ) .",
    "an intensity decrease of the @xmath78 reflection was observed in the field scale of several tesla .",
    "this effect is not directly connected to the reorientation of the spontaneous fm moments , which takes place for @xmath85 t ( see inset of fig . [ mag](a ) ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath17 , the @xmath8-afm moments are not coupled to the fm moments , at least for small fields ( @xmath85 t ) , and the origin of the weak fm signal for this compound is inconsistent with a zero - field spin - canting of the @xmath8-afm structure .",
    "the observation of magnetic clusters ( see fig .",
    "1 ) clearly points to a spatially inhomogeneous charge - carrier distribution in this system .",
    "the ratio between doped electrons and cluster densities ( @xmath6 , see above ) is independent of @xmath5 for electron - doped manganites and is identical to that found in hole - doped manganites @xcite , strongly suggesting a universal behavior .",
    "however , this large ratio and the small dimensions of the observed clusters ( comprising @xmath4 unit cells ) make it clear that only a fraction of the doped electrons are inside such clusters .",
    "the correct mechanism that leads to this phenomenon is not clear at this point .",
    "even with a few electrons in each cluster , the charge contrast inside and outside the droplets may be exceedingly high , particularly in the low - doping regime .",
    "simple electrostatic considerations indicate that the coulomb energy loss for a fm two - electron droplet with @xmath86   surrounding a la@xmath87 ion is of the order of 1 ev for low- and intermediate - doping regimes , and increases quadratically with the number of cluster electrons",
    ". this coulomb energy might overwhelm the delocalization energy gain per electron in the cluster ( @xmath88 ev ) , as already pointed out by chen and allen @xcite . in this context",
    ", it would appear natural to consider that clusters might be formed by electrostatic attraction in la - rich regions of the sample , presumably associated with intrinsic chemical inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "this mechanism would lead to electrically - neutral , mn@xmath87-rich , magnetic clusters .",
    "the relatively small cluster densities would be naturally accounted for in this scenario . on the other hand , the cluster diffraction profiles shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) imply a spatial short - range order similar to a liquid state , as opposed to a cluster gas where the cluster positions would be uncorrelated .",
    "such an order suggests intercluster repulsion , presumably dictated by coulomb forces between electrically charged and mobile clusters .",
    "the cluster diffraction also implies that neighboring clusters are magnetically correlated in both low- and intermediate - doping regimes , as opposed to a superparamagnetic state . in view of the above considerations",
    ", we believe that a truly intrinsic mechanism for small cluster formation in this system , i.e. , not caused by chemical inhomogeneities , should not be discarded at this point .",
    "the electrons outside the small magnetic clusters discussed above are likely to be important for the overall magnetic behavior of la - doped camno@xmath2 .",
    "in fact , using the fitting parameters obtained from fig .",
    "1 , the total cluster contributions to the sample - average magnetizations are estimated to be @xmath89mn for @xmath17 and @xmath90mn for @xmath18 , which are significantly smaller than the saturation magnetizations obtained from dc - magnetometry , @xmath91 and @xmath92mn , respectively @xcite .",
    "also , the combination of a long - range fm spin component and the orthogonal coupling between fm and @xmath8-afm spin components at intermediate - doping is a signature of a long - range @xmath8-afm + fm spin - canted state that does not appear to be accomplished at the low - doping regime .",
    "although the present set of experimental data , combined with previous work on la - doped camno@xmath2 @xcite , may be insufficient to lead to a complete description for the microscopic structure of the fm moments and doped electrons in this system , it severely constrains any plausible model , as described below .",
    "it is clear from the results above that a second type of doped electron is present in la - doped camno@xmath2 , besides the type forming relatively small fm clusters ( @xmath86  ) . given the long - range spin - canted state evidenced for intermediate doping , the extra electrons seem to be delocalized on the atomic scale .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that a metallic state is not accomplished at low temperatures @xcite , combined with the absence of an observable long - range fm component at low - doping , suggests that such extra electrons are not fully delocalized into a de gennes canted state @xcite either .",
    "thus , we suggest that these electrons are segregated into spin - canted regions of finite size , presumably larger than the small fm clusters directly observed by neutrons . these regions would overlap for intermediate - doping , leading to the observed long - range fm component perpendicularly coupled to the @xmath8-afm moments .",
    "we note that such hypothetical spin - canted clusters were not directly observed in our neutron scattering measurements , possibly due to the small magnetization contrast and/or large sizes leading to small differential cross section in the @xmath19-region accessible for elastic measurements ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . from a theoretical point of view , the formation of an inhomogeneous @xmath8-afm@xmath9fm spin - canted state in electron - doped manganites , evidenced in this work , might be the result of a balance between the well - known electronic instability of the homogeneous spin - canted @xmath8-afm state @xcite and the large coulomb energy cost of a radical phase segregation scenario where purely fm droplets are formed into a pure @xmath8-afm background .",
    "our results on la - doped camno@xmath2 indicate that a fraction of the doped electrons segregate into small ( @xmath86  ) fm clusters embedded in the @xmath8-afm matrix of the undoped compound .",
    "the remaining electrons are presumably delocalized over a more extended volume , leading to an inhomogeneous spin - canted state at intermediate doping .",
    "the density of the @xmath54  - clusters , as well as the fm component of the spin - canted state , increase with the doping level , and the overall fm moment becomes increasingly dominant over the @xmath8-afm spin component .",
    "nevertheless , the pure fm metallic state is never stabilized for la - doped camno@xmath2 , due to the gradual emergence of the orbitally - ordered @xmath63-afm state for @xmath93 , which competes with the @xmath8-afm + fm state through a first - order phase transition , as explored in the following paper @xcite . this competition leads to mesoscopic magnetic and crystallographic phase separation over a large @xmath5- and @xmath12-interval , and finally to the stabilization of the @xmath63-afm phase for @xmath94 @xcite .",

    "an estimation of the difference between the average magnetization inside and outside the droplets ( @xmath95 ) may be obtained from the cross sections , as described in ref .",
    "we obtain @xmath96 @xmath97mn for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
