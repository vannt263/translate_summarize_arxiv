    "the introduction of unitary techniques in a chiral dynamical treatment of the meson baryon interaction has been very successful .",
    "it has lead to good reproduction of meson baryon data with a minimum amount of free parameters , and has led to the dynamical generation of many low lying resonances which qualify as quasibound meson baryon states  @xcite . in particular , the application of these techniques to the @xmath6-wave scattering of the baryon octet and the pseudoscalar meson octet have led to the successful description of many @xmath7 resonances like the @xmath8 , the @xmath9 , the @xmath10 , the @xmath11 and the @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "naively one may expect that this scheme is not suitable for studying @xmath13-wave resonances due to a large number of unknown parameters in the corresponding chiral lagrangian .",
    "however @xmath13-wave resonances could be studied in @xmath6 wave interactions of the meson octet with the baryon decuplet  @xcite , in which case chiral dynamics is quite predictive .",
    "the fact that some well known @xmath13 wave resonances like the @xmath14 have very large branching ratios to the @xmath15 channel though the @xmath16 channel is favoured by phase space , lends support to this scheme .",
    "we have performed a systematic study  @xcite of the @xmath6-wave interaction of the baryon decuplet with the meson octet taking the dominant lowest order chiral lagrangian , which accounts for the weinberg tomozawa term . in this talk",
    "we will present the main results of this work .",
    "the tree - level scattering amplitude involving the baryon decuplet and the pseudoscalar octet is used as the kernel of the bethe salpeter equation to obtain the transition matrix fulfilling exact unitarity in coupled channels . in this approach ,",
    "the only free parameter is the subtraction constant in the dimensionally regularized meson baryon loop function for which we took a natural size value .",
    "we have looked in detail at the @xmath17 resonances which are generated dynamically by this interaction , by searching for poles of the transition matrix in the complex plane in different riemann sheets .",
    "the search was done systematically , starting from an @xmath1 symmetric situation where the masses of the baryons are made equal and the same is done with the masses of the mesons . in this case",
    "we found attraction in an octet , a decuplet and the 27 representation , while the interaction was repulsive in the 35 representation . in the @xmath1 symmetric case",
    "all states of the @xmath1 multiplet are degenerate and the resonances appear as bound states with no width . as we gradually break @xmath1 symmetry by changing the masses ,",
    "the degeneracy is broken and the states with different strangeness and isospin split apart generating pole trajectories in the complex plane which lead us to the physical situation in the final point , as seen in fig .",
    "[ trajfig ] .",
    "this systematic search allows us to trace the poles to their @xmath1 symmetric origin , although there is a mixing of representations when the symmetry is broken .",
    "in addition we also find poles which only appear for a certain amount of symmetry breaking and thus have no analog in the symmetric case .",
    "we have also evaluated the residues of the poles from where the couplings of the resonances to the different coupled channels were found and this allowed us to make predictions for partial decay widths into a decuplet baryon and a meson .",
    "there is very limited experimental information on these decay channels but , even then , it represents an extra check of consistency of the results which allowed us to more easily identify the resonances found with some resonances known , or state that the resonance should correspond to a new resonance not yet reported in the particle data book ( pdb ) .",
    "in particular , in view of the information of the pole positions and couplings to channels we could associate some of the resonances found to the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath20 , @xmath3 resonances tabulated in the pdb .",
    "we could also favour the correspondence of a resonance found in @xmath21 to the @xmath22 on the basis of the quantum numbers , position and compatibility of the partial decay width found with the total width of the @xmath22 .",
    "the scattering amplitudes for different values of strangeness and isospin as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ allfigs ] .",
    "we also found several extra resonances , well identified by poles in the complex plane which do not have a correspondent one in the pdb .",
    "some of them are too broad , which could justify the difficulty in their observation , but two other resonances , the @xmath23 with a width around 300 mev and the @xmath24 with a width of about 40 mev stand much better chances of observation .",
    "the first one because of its large strength in the @xmath25 channel and the second one because of its narrowness .",
    "in addition , our study produces couplings of the resonances to baryon - meson channels which could facilitate the identification when further information on these branching ratios is available .",
    "we have found that in some cases the dynamically generated resonances couple very strongly to some channels with the threshold above the resonance energy , which makes them qualify as approximately single channel quasibound meson - baryon states .",
    "lastly , we mention the very interesting case concerning the @xmath26 resonance  @xcite found in @xmath27 which shows up as a pole in the unphysical riemann sheet and leads to @xmath26 cross sections much larger than the corresponding @xmath26 cross sections in @xmath28 .",
    "we suggest that these two cross sections could be seen in @xmath26 production in @xmath29 and @xmath30 reactions and could provide evidence for this new exotic pentaquark state , although its structure is more efficiently taken into account in the meson baryon picture where it has been generated ."
