    "pure gravity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has renewed interest in recent years as gravity does not propagate out side the source , in other words , matter curves spacetime only locally .",
    "recently , very interesting studies about @xmath0 gravastars , @xmath0 black holes , @xmath0 wormholes and @xmath0 dimensional stars have been developed @xcite .    in recent past ,",
    "morris and thorne @xcite have shown that general relativity admits that the presence of matter twists the geometric fabric of spacetime in such a way that a bridge can be formed between two asymptotic regions . this bridge can be interpreted as instantons describing a tunnelling between two distant regions .",
    "this geometrical structure is known as wormhole . however , according morris and thorne @xcite , the construction of wormhole would require a very unusual form of matter , termed as exotic matter that characterized the stress energy tensor .",
    "the necessary ingredients that supply fuel to construct wormholes remain an elusive goal for theoretical physicists .",
    "several proposals have been proposed in literature @xcite .",
    "also some authors have used alternative theories of gravity to exclude exotic matter , such as brans - dicke theory , brain world , c - field theory , kalb - ramond , einstein - maxwell theory etc @xcite .    to minimize the usage of exotic matter",
    ", visser @xcite has proposed a way , which is known as cut and paste technique , to construct a wormhole in which the exotic matter is concentrated at the wormhole throat .",
    "visser s tactics is more accessible because it minimizes the amount of exotic matter required .",
    "for this reason , visser s approach was adopted by various authors to construct thin shell wormholes @xcite .",
    "recently , baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite has discovered an explicit vacuum solution of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant . it has been argued that the existence of such physical systems with an event horizon and thermodynamic properties similar to ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional black holes .",
    "these vacuum solution of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity are asymptotically anti - de sitter and are known as btz black holes .",
    "motivated by the properties of this black hole solution , the authors have developed other interesting work about the geometry of the spinning black holes of standard einstein theory in @xmath0 dimension @xcite .    in this paper , we present a new type of thin - shell wormhole employing such a class of btz black holes by means of the cut - and - paste technique @xcite . as far as our knowledge , this is the first example of stable thin shell wormhole in ( 2 + 1)-dimension .",
    "various aspects of this thin - shell wormhole are analyzed , particularly the equation of state relating pressure and density .",
    "also it has been discussed the attractive or repulsive nature of the wormhole .",
    "we also make a survey of stability of this wormhole .",
    "baados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite have discovered an explicit vacuum solution of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant as @xmath1 the parameter @xmath2 is the conserved mass associated with asymptotic invariance under time displacements .",
    "this mass is given by a flux integral through a large circle at space - like infinity .    from the btz black hole , we can take two copies of the region with @xmath3 :    @xmath4    and paste them at the junction surface    @xmath5    here we take @xmath6 to avoid horizon and this new construction produces a geodesically complete manifold @xmath7 with a matter shell at the surface @xmath8 , where the throat of the wormhole is located .    here",
    "the junction surface is a one dimensional ring of matter .",
    "let , @xmath9 denotes the riemann normal coordinate at the junction .",
    "we assume @xmath9 be positive and negative in two sides of the junction surface .",
    "mathematically , we have @xmath10 and the normal vector components @xmath11 with the metric    @xmath12 + the second fundamental forms associated with the two sides of the shell @xcite are given by @xmath13 so , the discontinuity in the second fundamental forms is given as @xmath14    now , from lanczos equation in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional spacetime , one can obtain the surface stress energy tensor @xmath15 where , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are line energy density and line tension , respectively @xcite as    @xmath18    to understand the dynamics of the wormhole , we assume the radius of the throat to be a function of proper time , or @xmath19 .",
    "also , overdot and prime denote , respectively , the derivatives with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    employing relevant information into eqs .",

    "note that line tension ( @xmath17 ) is negative which implies that there is a line pressure ( p ) as opposed to a line tension . here , we have used @xmath25 .    for a static configuration of radius @xmath21 ,",
    "we obtain ( assuming @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) from eqs .",

    "moreover , on this shell , which is infinitely thin , the radial pressure is zero .",
    "one can note that @xmath31 , @xmath32 are positive .",
    "so the shell contains matter that violates only the null energy condition ( nec ) and obeys the weak and strong energy condition . for the assumed case ,",
    "variations of left hand side of the expressions of energy conditions have been shown in figure 1 .",
    "now , to study the nature of the gravitational field of the wormhole constructed from btz black hole , we calculate the observer s three - acceleration @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . in view of the line element , eq .",

    "this result is similar to the case of the thin shell wormhole constructed from schwarzschild black hole@xcite .",
