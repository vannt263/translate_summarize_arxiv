    "light hadron spectroscopy lies beyond the applicability regime of perturbative qcd",
    ". however , there is a rigorous and systematic expansion in the form of an effective field theory of qcd , known as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , which provides a model independent description of the dynamics of the lightest mesons , namely , the goldstone bosons of the qcd spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . despite pure chpt is limited to low energies and masses , here we review how",
    ", when combined with model independent dispersion relations , it leads to a successful description of meson dynamics , generating resonant states without a priori assumptions on their existence or nature .",
    "this `` unitarized chpt '' is a useful tool to identify the spectroscopic nature of resonances through their dependence on the qcd number of colors @xmath0 , but also to relate lattice results to physical resonances by studying their quark mass dependence .",
    "we will concentrate on the meson sector , where chpt is most developed and converges somewhat better , and is built out of pion , kaon and eta fields only , as a low energy expansion of a lagrangian respecting all qcd symmetries .",
    "generically , it is organized in powers of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 stands either for derivatives , momenta or meson masses , and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the pion decay constant .",
    "chpt is renormalized order by order by absorbing loop divergences in the renormalization of parameters of higher order counterterms , known as low energy constants ( lecs ) that _ carry no energy or mass dependence_. their values depend on the specific qcd dynamics , and have to be determined either from experiment or from qcd .",
    "the relevant remark for us is that , up to the desired order , the chpt expansion provides a _ systematic and model independent _ description of how meson masses and amplitudes depend on qcd parameters like the light quark masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 , or the leading @xmath7 behavior @xcite .",
    "elastic resonances appear as poles on the second riemann sheet of the meson - meson scattering partial waves @xmath8 of definite isospin @xmath9 and angular momentum @xmath10 . at physical values of @xmath11 ,",
    "elastic unitarity implies    @xmath12    where @xmath11 is the mandelstam variable and @xmath2 is the center of mass momentum .",
    "however , chpt amplitudes , being an expansion @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , can only satisfy eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) perturbatively @xmath15 and can not generate poles . despite the resonance region lies beyond the reach of standard chpt , it can be reached combining chpt with dispersion theory either for the amplitude  @xcite or for the inverse amplitude through the inverse amplitude method ( iam )  @xcite .",
    "the first approach has been successfully used , combined with data on other channels and high energies , to , for instance , determine precisely the parameters of the @xmath16 or @xmath17 resonances .",
    "unfortunately , this additional experimental input makes it difficult to relate these results to qcd parameters like @xmath0 or @xmath18 .",
    "hence we will concentrate on the _ one - channel _ iam @xcite , since it uses chpt only up to a given order inside a dispersion relation  without additional input or further model dependent assumptions  providing an elastic unitary amplitude with the correct chpt expansion up to that order .",
    "other unitarization techniques will be commented below .      for a partial wave @xmath19 ,",
    "we can write a dispersion relation ( subtracted three times to suppress high energy contributions ) @xmath20note we have explicitly written the integral over the right hand cut ( or physical cut , extending from threshold , @xmath21 to infinity ) but we have abbreviated by @xmath22 the equivalent expression for the left cut ( from 0 to @xmath23 ) .",
    "we could do similarly with other cuts , if present , as in the @xmath24 case .",
    "similar expressions hold for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , but remembering that @xmath25 is a pure tree level amplitude and it does not have imaginary part nor cuts , they read : @xmath27 note that from eq .",
    "the imaginary part of the _ inverse amplitude _ is _ exactly _ known in the elastic regime .",
    "we can then write a dispersion relation like that in but now for the auxiliary function @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 where now @xmath30 stands for possible pole contributions in @xmath31 coming from zeros in @xmath8 .",
    "it is now straightforward to expand the subtraction constants and use that @xmath32 and @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , up to the given order , @xmath35 , whereas @xmath30 is of higher order and can be neglected on a first stage",
    ". then @xmath36 we have thus arrived to the so - called iam : @xmath37 that provides an elastic amplitude satisfying unitarity and has the correct low energy expansion of chpt up to the order we have used .",
    "the @xmath30 contribution has been calculated explicitly @xcite and shown to be , not just formally suppressed , but numerically negligible except near the adler zeros , away from the physical region .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the iam to other elastic channels or higher orders @xcite .",
    "naively , by looking at , it seems that the iam is derived by replacing @xmath38 by its @xmath39 chpt expansion .",
    "but , strictly speaking , is only valid in the real axis , whereas our derivation allows us to consider the amplitude in the complex plane , and , in particular , look for poles of the associated resonances .",
    "let us remark that chpt has been used always _ at low energies _ to evaluate parts of a dispersion relation , whose elastic unitarity cut is taken into account exactly .",
    "thus , the iam formula is reliable up to energies where inelasticities become important ( even though chpt does not converge at those energies ) because chpt is not being used there .",
    "only when the energy is close to the adler zero one should use a slightly modified version of the iam @xcite .",
    "when reexpanding , a few of the higher order terms are produced correctly by the unitarization but not the complete series for a discussion of this issue for the scalar pion form factor see ref.@xcite .    in fig.[fig : fits ] , we present some preliminary results @xcite of an updated fit of the iam @xmath40 and @xmath24 scattering amplitudes to data , but simultaneously fitting the available lattice results on @xmath41 and some scattering lengths .",
    "it is important to remark that the resulting lecs are in fairly good agreement with standard determinations : no fine tuning is required . as usual the @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath17 and @xmath43 appear as poles in the second riemann sheet of their corresponding partial wave . actually , already ten years ago @xcite , with the elastic iam we were able to generate poles for the @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the controversial @xmath44 ( or @xmath16 ) , _ without any modeling of the integrals but just chpt approximations_. the fact that resonances are _ not introduced by hand _ , but generated from first principles and data , is relevant because the existence and nature of scalar resonances is the subject of a long - lasting intense debate .",
    "the fact that _ the only input parameters are those of chpt _ is very relevant because we then know how to relate our amplitudes to qcd parameters like @xmath0 or the quark masses",
    ".      naively one can arrive to in a matrix form , ensuring coupled channel unitarity , just by expanding the real part of the inverse @xmath45 matrix .",
    "unfortunately , _ there is still no dispersive derivation _ including a left cut _ for the coupled channel case_. being much more complicated , different approximations to @xmath46 have been used :    @xmath47 the fully renormalized one - loop chpt calculation of @xmath46 provides the correct chpt expansion in all channels , also with left cuts approximated to @xmath39 @xcite . indeed , using lecs consistent with previous determinations within standard chpt , it was possible @xcite to describe below 1.2 gev all the scattering channels of two body states made of pions , kaons or etas .",
    "simultaneously , this approach @xcite generates poles associated to the @xmath42 and @xmath43 vector mesons , together with the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath16 and @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) scalar resonances .",
    "@xmath47 originally @xcite , the coupled channel iam was used neglecting the crossed loops and tadpoles .",
    "this approach is considerably simpler , and although it is true that the left cut is absent , its numerical influence was shown to be rather small , since the meson - meson data are nicely described with very reasonable chiral parameters and generates all the poles enumerated above .",
    "let us remark that this approximation keeps the s - channel loops but also the tree level up to @xmath39 , and that this tree level encodes the effect of heavier resonances , like the rho .",
    "thus , contrary to some common belief , this approach still incorporates , for instance , the low energy effects of t - channel rho exchange .",
    "@xmath47 finally , if only scalar meson - meson scattering is of interest , it is possible to use just one cutoff ( or a dimensional regularization scale or a subtraction constant ) that numerically mimics the combination of chiral parameters that appear in those scalar channels .",
    "this method  known as the `` chiral unitary approach'' has become very popular , even beyond the meson - meson interaction realm , due to its great simplicity but remarkable success @xcite and also because it is rather simple to relate to the bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite that provides additional physical insight on unitarization .    with this method",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , in the su(3 ) limit , and assuming no quark mass dependence on the cutoff , all light scalar resonances degenerate into an octet and a singlet .    also with this method , but using a chiral lagrangian for the pseudoscalar - vector interaction it has been possible to generate axial - vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the qcd @xmath7 expansion @xcite , valid in the whole energy region , provides a rigorous definition of @xmath52 bound states : their masses and widths behave as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the qcd leading @xmath7 behavior of @xmath4 and the lecs is well known , and chpt amplitudes have no cutoffs or subtraction constants where spurious @xmath0 dependences could hide .",
    "hence , by scaling with @xmath0 the chpt parameters in the iam , the mass and width @xmath0 dependence of the resonances has been determined to one and two loops @xcite .",
    "these are defined from the pole position as @xmath55 .",
    "however , _ a priori _ , one should be careful _ not to take @xmath0 too large , and in particular to avoid the @xmath56 limit , because it is a weakly interacting limit_. as shown above , the iam relies on the fact that the exact elastic @xmath57 contribution dominates the dispersion relation .",
    "since the iam describes data and the resonances within , say , 10 to 20% errors , this means that at @xmath58 the other contributions are not approximated badly .",
    "but meson loops , responsible for the @xmath57 , scale as @xmath59 whereas the inaccuracies due to the approximations scale partly as @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we can estimate that those 10 to 20% errors at @xmath58 may become 100% errors at , say @xmath60 or @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "hence we have never shown results @xcite beyond @xmath62 , and even beyond @xmath61 they should be interpreted with care . of course",
    ", in special cases the iam could still work for very large @xmath0 , as it is has been shown for the vector channel @xcite .",
    "but that is not the case for the scalar channel , which , if used for too large @xmath0 , leads to inconsistencies @xcite for some values of the lecs .",
    "thus , fig.[ncsu3 ] shows the behavior of the @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath44 masses and widths found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath63 and @xmath64 neatly follow the expected behavior for a @xmath52 state : @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "the bands cover the uncertainty in @xmath67 gev where the lecs are scaled with @xmath0 .",
    "note also in fig.2  ( top - right ) that , for that set of lecs , _ outside this @xmath68 range _",
    "the @xmath63 meson starts deviating from a a @xmath52 behavior .",
    "something similar occurs to the @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , we can not apply the @xmath0 scaling at an arbitrary @xmath68 value , if the well established @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xmath52 nature is to be reproduced .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath44 shows a different behavior from that of a pure @xmath52 : _ near @xmath0=3 _ both its mass and width grow with @xmath0 , i.e. its pole moves away from the real axis .",
    "of course , far from @xmath58 , and for some choices of lecs and @xmath68 , the sigma pole might turn back to the real axis @xcite , as seen in fig.2 ( bottom - right ) .",
    "but , as commented above , the iam is less reliable for large @xmath0 , and at most this behavior only suggests that there _ might be _ a subdominant @xmath69 component @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have to ensure that the lecs used fit data and reproduce the vector @xmath52 behavior .",
    "since loops are important in determining the scalar pole position , but are @xmath7 suppressed compared to tree level terms with lecs , it is relevant to check the @xmath39 results with an @xmath70 iam calculation .",
    "this was done within @xmath71 chpt in @xcite .",
    "we defined a @xmath72-like function to measure how close a resonance is from a @xmath52 @xmath0 behavior .",
    "first , we used that @xmath72-like function at @xmath39 to show that it is not possible for the @xmath44 to behave predominantly as a @xmath69 while describing simultaneously the data and the @xmath63 @xmath52 behavior , thus _ confirming the robustness of the conclusions for @xmath0 close to 3_. next , we obtained a @xmath70 data fit  where the @xmath63 @xmath52 behavior was imposed ",
    "whose @xmath0 behavior for the @xmath63 and @xmath44 mass and width is shown in fig.3  ( left and center ) .",
    "note that both @xmath73 and @xmath74 grow with @xmath0 near @xmath58 , confirming the @xmath39 result of a non @xmath52 dominant component .",
    "however , as @xmath0 grows further , between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where we still trust the iam results , @xmath73 becomes constant and @xmath74 starts decreasing .",
    "this may hint to a _",
    "subdominant @xmath52 component _ , arising as loop diagrams become suppressed when @xmath0 grows . finally , and despite this scenario",
    "is disfavored since the @xmath63 starts deviating from its @xmath52 behavior , we checked how big this @xmath44 @xmath52 component can be made .",
    "thus we forced the @xmath44 to behave as a @xmath52 using the above mentioned @xmath72-like measure .",
    "we found that in the best case  fig.3 .",
    "( right )  this subdominant @xmath52 component could become dominant around @xmath77 , at best , but always with an @xmath56 mass above roughly 1 gev instead of its physical @xmath78 mev value .",
    "let us emphasize again @xcite what can and _ what can not _ be concluded from our results and clarify some frequent questions and doubts raised in this and other meetings , private discussions and the literature :    @xmath47    _ the of the @xmath44 and @xmath50 _ in meson - meson scattering _ does not behave as a @xmath79_. why `` dominant '' ? because , most likely , scalars are a mixture of different states .",
    "if the @xmath79 was _ dominant _ , they would behave as the @xmath63 or the @xmath64 in fig.2 .",
    "_ but a smaller fraction of @xmath79 can not be excluded _ and is somewhat favored in our @xmath70 analysis @xcite .",
    "_ two meson and some tetraquark states @xcite have a consistent `` qualitative '' behavior _",
    ", i.e. , both disappear in the meson - meson scattering continuum as @xmath0 increases .",
    "our results are not able yet to establish the nature of that dominant component . to do so other tools might be necessary as , for instance , those outlined in @xcite .",
    "the most we could state is that the behavior of two - meson states or some tetraquarks might be qualitatively consistent .",
    "the @xmath80 limit has been studied in @xcite .",
    "apart from its mathematical interest , it could have some physical relevance if the data and the large @xmath0 uncertainty on the choice of scale were more accurate . nevertheless :    .",
    "as commented above , _ a priori the iam is not reliable in the @xmath80 limit _ , since it corresponds to a weakly interacting theory , where exact unitarity becomes less relevant in confront of other approximations made in the iam derivation .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that it might work well in that limit in the vector channel of qcd but not in the scalar channel .",
    "another reason to limit ourselves to @xmath0 not too far from 3 is that in our calculations we have not included the @xmath81 , whose mass is related to the @xmath82 anomaly and scales as @xmath83 .",
    "nevertheless , if in our calculations we keep @xmath84 , its mass would be @xmath85mev and thus pions are still the only relevant degrees of freedom for the scalar channel in the @xmath44 region .",
    "_ contrary to the leading @xmath7 behavior , the @xmath80 limit does not give information on the `` dominant component '' of light scalars .",
    "_ the reason was commented above : in contrast to @xmath79 states , that become bound , two - meson and some tetraquark states dissolve in the continuum as @xmath80 .",
    "thus , even if we started with an infinitesimal @xmath79 component in a resonance , for a sufficiently large @xmath0 it may become dominant , and beyond that @xmath0 the associated pole would behave as a @xmath79 state . also , since the mixings of different components could change with @xmath0 , a too large @xmath0 could alter significantly the original mixings .",
    "actually , this is what happens for the one - loop iam @xmath44 resonance for @xmath56 , but it does _ not _ necessarily mean that the `` correct interpretation [ ... ] is that the @xmath44 pole is a conventional @xmath79 meson environed by heavy pion clouds '' @xcite . that the scalars are not conventional , is simply seen by comparing them in figs.1 and 2 with the `` conventional '' @xmath63 and @xmath64 in those very same figures .",
    "a large two - meson component is consistent , but the @xmath80 of the one - loop unitarized chpt pole in the scalar channel limit is not unique @xcite given the uncertainty in the chiral parameters .",
    "moreover , for some lecs the scalar channel one - loop iam in the @xmath80 limit can lead to phenomenological inconsistencies @xcite , since poles can even move to negative squared mass values ( weird ) , to infinity or to a positive mass square .",
    "that is one of the reasons why in the figures here and in @xcite we only plot up to @xmath62 , but not 100 , or a million .",
    "hence , robust conclusions on the dominant light scalar component can be obtained not too far from real life , say @xmath86 or 30 , for a @xmath68 choice between roughly @xmath87 and 1 gev , that simultaneously ensures the @xmath52 dependence for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 mesons .",
    "note , however , that under these same conditions the two - loop iam still finds , not only a dominant non-@xmath52 component , but also a hint of a @xmath52 subdominant component , which is not conventional in the sense that it appears at a much higher mass than the physical @xmath44 .",
    "this may support the existence of a second @xmath52 scalar octet above 1 gev @xcite .    finally , using not the iam , but the chiral unitary approach with a natural range for the cutoff @xmath0 dependence , it has also been suggested @xcite that a large , in some cases dominant , non @xmath52 behavior could exist in axial vector mesons .",
    "chpt provides a rigorous expansion of meson masses in terms of quark masses ( at leading order @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus , by changing the meson masses in the amplitudes , we see how the poles generated with the iam depend on quark masses . in @xcite",
    "we presented the su(2 ) analysis for the @xmath63 and @xmath44 but here we also report on our recent developments @xcite in the su(3 ) formalism and the @xmath17 and @xmath43 strange resonances .",
    "the values of @xmath89 considered should fall within the chpt range of applicability and allow for some elastic @xmath40 and @xmath24 regime below @xmath90 or @xmath91 thresholds , respectively .",
    "both criteria are satisfied if @xmath92 mev , since @xmath93 chpt still works with such kaon masses , and because for @xmath94 mev , the kaon mass becomes @xmath95 mev . of course",
    ", we expect higher order corrections , which are not considered here , to become more relevant as @xmath89 is increased .",
    "thus , our results become less reliable as @xmath89 increases due to the @xmath70 corrections which we have neglected    fig .",
    "[ poles ] ( left ) shows the evolution of the @xmath44 and @xmath63 pole positions as @xmath89 is increased . in order to see the pole movements relative to the two pion threshold , which is also increasing ,",
    "all quantities are given in units of @xmath89 , so the threshold is fixed at @xmath96 .",
    "both poles move closer to threshold and they approach the real axis .",
    "the @xmath63 poles reach the real axis as the same time that they cross threshold .",
    "one of them jumps into the first sheet and stays below threshold in the real axis as a bound state , while its conjugate partner remains on the second sheet practically at the very same position as the one in the first .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath44 poles go below threshold with a finite imaginary part before they meet in the real axis , still on the second sheet , becoming virtual states .",
    "as @xmath89 is increased further , one of the poles moves toward threshold and jumps through the branch point to the first sheet staying in the real axis below threshold , very close to it as @xmath89 keeps growing .",
    "the other @xmath44 pole moves down in energies further from threshold and remains on the second sheet .",
    "these very asymmetric poles could be a signal of a prominent molecular component @xcite , at least for large pion masses .",
    "similar movements have been found within quark models @xcite and a finite density analysis @xcite .",
    "[ poles ] ( right ) shows our results for the @xmath63 mass dependence on @xmath89 compared with some recent lattice results  @xcite , and the pdg value for the @xmath63 mass .",
    "now the mass is defined as the point where the phase shift crosses @xmath97 , except for those @xmath89 values where the @xmath63 becomes a bound state , where it is defined again from the pole position .",
    "taking into account the incompatibilities within errors between different lattice collaborations , we find a qualitative good agreement with the lattice results .",
    "also , we have to consider that the @xmath89 dependence in our approach is correct only up to nlo in chpt , and we expect higher order corrections to be important for large pion masses .",
    "the @xmath98 dependence on @xmath89 agrees nicely with the estimations for the two first coefficients of its chiral expansion @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ massandwidth ] ( left ) we compare the @xmath89 dependence of @xmath98 and @xmath73 ( defined from the pole position @xmath99 ) , normalized to their physical values .",
    "the bands cover the lecs uncertainties .",
    "we see that both masses grow with @xmath89 , but @xmath73 grows faster than @xmath98 . below @xmath100 mev",
    "we only show one line because the two conjugate @xmath44 poles have the same mass . above 330 mev",
    ", these two poles lie on the real axis with two different masses .",
    "the heavier pole goes towards threshold and around @xmath101 mev moves into the first sheet , but that is beyond our applicability limit .    in the next panel of fig .",
    "[ massandwidth ] we compare the @xmath89 dependence of @xmath102 and @xmath74 normalized to their physical values : note that both widths become smaller .",
    "we compare this decrease with the expected phase space reduction as resonances approach the @xmath40 threshold .",
    "we find that @xmath102 follows very well this expected behavior , which implies that the @xmath103 coupling is almost @xmath89 independent .",
    "in contrast , @xmath74 deviates from the phase space reduction expectation .",
    "this suggests a strong @xmath89 dependence of the @xmath44 coupling to two pions , necessarily present for molecular states @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , in the last two panels of fig.[massandwidth ] we compare the mass and width dependence on @xmath18 of the @xmath17 versus the @xmath43 , keeping @xmath6 fixed .",
    "note that the same pattern of the @xmath104 system is repeated .",
    "belonging to the same octet , the @xmath43 and @xmath63 behave very similarly , and both their widths follow just phase space reduction .",
    "the @xmath44 @xmath50 behavior are only qualitatively similar , the latter being somewhat softer . among other effects",
    ", this might be due to a possible significant admixture of singlet state in the @xmath44 .",
    "we have reviewed how the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite is derived from the first principles of analyticity , unitarity , and chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) at low energies .",
    "it is able to generate , as poles in the amplitudes , the light resonances appearing in meson - meson elastic scattering , without any a priori assumptions . up to a given order in chpt , it yields the correct dependences on the quark masses and the number of colors .",
    "the resonance leading @xmath7 behavior suggests that the dominant component of light scalars does not behave as a @xmath79 state as @xmath0 increases not far from @xmath58 . when using the two loop iam result in su(2 ) , below @xmath10515 or 30 , there is a hint of a subdominant @xmath79 component , but arising at roughly twice the mass of the physical @xmath44 .",
    "we have also predicted the evolution of the @xmath106 and @xmath43 pole positions with increasing pion ( quark ) mass @xcite and have seen how they become bound states : softly in the vector case and with a non - analyticity in the scalar case .",
    "we have also shown that the vector - meson - meson coupling constant is almost @xmath89 independent and we have found a qualitative agreement with some lattice results for the @xmath63 mass evolution with @xmath89 . these findings might be relevant for studies of the meson spectrum and form factors  see ref .  @xcite on the lattice .",
