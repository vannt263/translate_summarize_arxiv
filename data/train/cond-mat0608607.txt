    "recently , two experimental groups @xcite , reported the existence of zero - photoresistance states ( zrs ) in ultraclean two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) subjected to microwave ( mw ) radiation and moderate perpendicular magnetic fields .    in these experiments the microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miro ) exhibit periods proportional to the inverse of the magnetic field alternated with zrs regions governed by the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the cyclotron an mw frequency .",
    "the oscillation amplitudes reach maxima at @xmath3 and minima at @xmath4 , for @xmath5 an integer@xcite .    despite the large amount of theoretical work @xcite",
    "the origin of zrs remains elusive .",
    "nevertheless most theories agree that some mechanism produces negative - resistance states ( nrs ) that rapidly drive the system into a zrs due to andreev s instabilities@xcite .",
    "some of the models @xcite suggest that the main cause of nrs is photon - assisted scattering by impurities or disorder .",
    "alternative explanations @xcite propose that nrs arise from mw induced distribution function fluctuations .",
    "it is important to mention that some theories do not need to invoke andreev s instabilities @xcite .    in recent experiments @xcite the bichromatic resistance",
    "was found to be well described by the superposition of the two independent monochromatic components in the following terms . when both monochromatic resistances are positive or zero the bichromatic resistivity agrees with the sum of both components .",
    "if only one of the monochromatic resistances is zero the bichromatic resistance is lower than the expected from the direct superposition principle .    in this work",
    "we develop a model that is based on the exact solution of the shrdinger equation of a 2d electron in the presence of a static magnetic field @xmath6 interacting with a mw radiation and a perturbative calculation of randomly distributed impurities . for small radiation intensities",
    "the conductivity follows the superposition principle suggested by zudov @xcite .",
    "the lowering of the bichromatic resistivities is shown to originate from the superposition of nrs and positive resistance ( pr ) from the independent monochromatic contributions .",
    "in order to calculate the expectation value of the current density we need the time dependent density matrix @xmath7 which obeys the von neumann equation @xmath8}$ ] where @xmath9 is the bias voltage and the hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 the mw bichromatic radiation s electric field @xmath11 is obtained from the vector potential@xmath12}. $ ] here , the electric fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 are decomposed in their polarization vectors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 respectively . the unperturbed hamiltonian contains both components of the microwave radiation and a uniform magnetic field @xmath19 where @xmath20 are canonical operators that obey the commutation relations @xmath21}={\\left[q_2,p_2\\right]}=ieb$ ] , @xmath22}={\\left[p_1,p_2\\right]}$ ] @xmath23}={\\left[q_2,p_1\\right]}=0 $ ] .",

    "@xmath26 the position of the @xmath27th impurity and the explicit form of @xmath28 depends on the type of impurity . for the sake of simplicity in this work we will only consider uncharged impurities .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath29 can be reduced to a harmonic oscillator through a unitary transformation given by@xcite @xmath30     ( blue ) and @xmath31 ( red ) . in panel",
    "( b ) the blue line shows the bichromatic conductivity @xmath32 and the red line is a plot of @xmath33 .",
    "the dotted lines indicates nrs . in this example",

    "the inset contains plots of successive values of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . ]    where the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are solutions of the dynamical equations that follow form the variation of the classical lagrangian @xmath43}$ ] with @xmath44 the magnetic longitude .",
    "the solution to the classical dynamical equations and the unitary transformation ( [ unit1 ] ) constitute the exact solution for the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the impurity potential is considered through first order time dependent perturbation theory . solving von neumann equation in the linear approximation ,",
    "the longitudinal conductivity is calculated as described in @xcite leading to expressions for the dark @xmath45 and illuminated @xmath46 conductivities .",
    "the dark part of the conductivity leads to shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "the illuminated longitudinal conductivity is given by @xmath47 the temperature dependence enters the conductivity through @xmath48}g_{\\nu}{\\left({\\mathcal{e}}+\\omega_1l_1+\\omega_2l_2+{\\mathcal{e}}_0\\right)}\\right\\}}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath50 , @xmath51}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath52 is a phenomenological damping factor .",
    "the term @xmath53}\\nonumber\\\\ + \\frac{1}{2}{\\left\\vert \\frac{a_ic_{\\mu\\nu}^{l_1l_2 + } } { { \\mathcal{e}}_{\\mu\\nu}+\\omega_1l_1+\\omega_2l_2-\\omega_c } + \\frac{b_ic_{\\mu\\nu}^{l_1l_2- } } { { \\mathcal{e}}_{\\mu\\nu}+\\omega_1l_1+\\omega_2l_2+\\omega_c } \\right\\vert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] accounts for the miro where @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56}\\label{lacl1l2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 the associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "in most experiments @xcite the intensity of bichromatic radiation is small compared to the separation of the landau levels , that is @xmath58 , and the wave length of the microwave radiation is larger than the magnetic length @xmath59 thus @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the two leading terms of the illuminated longitudinal conductivity under this conditions are @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the corresponding monochromatic conductivities given by @xmath65 given the complexity of the previous expressions , the integrals over the energy where performed numerically .",
    "the bichromatic magnetoresistivity is then @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we observe the monochromatic components of the magneto - resistivity [ panel ( a ) ] for frequencies @xmath67 , @xmath68 , the mobility is @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the nrs are plotted with dotted lines .",
    "the bichromatic magneto - resistivity is plotted in panel ( b ) .",
    "we notice that when two positive resistivities superimpose the bichromatic resistivity is simply their sum .",
    "more specifically , at @xmath71 the peaks from the monochromatic contributions overlap . on the other hand ,",
    "when a positive resistivity is superimposed with a zrs , the bichromatic resistivity is suppressed indicating the existence of nrs . at @xmath72 , for example , @xmath73 and @xmath74 thus @xmath75 . in the inset of panel ( b )",
    "we observe that as @xmath76 arises , it is even possible to produce zrs ( for @xmath77 and @xmath40 ) by overlapping a nrs with a pr state .",
    "based on linear response theory we have presented a theoretical model to explain the miro superposition principle observed by zudov .",
    "we have shown that the interaction of impurity assisted nrs an pr states from the monochromatic components are responsible for the enhancement and suppression of the bichromatic resistivity .",
    "our calculations on the bichromatic conductivity have similar features as those observed by zudov .",
