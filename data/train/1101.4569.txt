    "we present a new method , based on the first integrals of the kepler problem , to compute a finite set of preliminary orbits of a celestial body from two short arcs of observations .",
    "we assume that the body moves on a keplerian orbit with a known center of attraction @xmath0 , corresponds to the center of the sun , for space debris @xmath0 is the center of the earth ] and is observed from a point @xmath1 , whose motion is a known function of time .",
    "we deal with two different kinds of observations , optical and radar , and we make use of the related attributables ( see @xcite , ) .    in the angular momentum and the energy integrals",
    "are used to solve the linkage problem for solar system bodies .",
    "this means to identify two attributables as related to the same observed object by computing ( at least ) one reliable orbit from the observations of both attributables .",
    "the equations of the problem are written in a polynomial form and the total degree of the system is 48 .",
    "the use of these integrals for the linkage problem has been first proposed in @xcite , but without fully exploiting the algebraic character of the problem .",
    "the algorithm presented in has been used in for the problem of _ correlation _ of space debris : here the authors have extended the method including the oblateness effect of the earth .    in this paper",
    "we propose different equations for the same problem : in particular we use a suitable projection of the laplace - lenz vector in place of the energy .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that there are several cancellations and the total degree is 20 .",
    "the same equations can be written using different data , simply considering other quantities as unknowns : in section  [ s : mixed ] we deal with the case of an optical and a radar attributable .",
    "this case is peculiar because we end up with a univariate polynomial of degree 4 .",
    "thus this problem admits _ explicit _ solutions . in both cases",
    "the solutions must fulfill compatibility conditions ( as also shown in  ) , taking into account the other integrals of kepler s problem . to select the solutions we propose a different strategy , based on the attribution algorithm of a very short arc to a known orbit , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . after introducing some definitions in section  [ s : att ]",
    ", we study the linkage of two optical attributables in section  [ s:2optatt ] , while in section  [ s : mixed ] we consider the same problem with one optical and one radar attributable .",
    "the degenerate cases are shown in section  [ s : degen ] .",
    "sections  [ s : covar ] and [ s : select ] are devoted to explain the computation of the covariance matrix for each orbit and the selection of the solutions .",
    "we conclude with a numerical test in section  [ s : examples ] .",
    "let us fix an inertial reference frame , with the origin at the center of attraction @xmath0 .",
    "the position @xmath2 and velocity @xmath3 of the observer are known functions of time .",
    "we describe the position of the observed body as the vectorial sum @xmath4 with @xmath5 the topocentric distance and @xmath6 the _ line of sight _ unit vector .",
    "we choose spherical coordinates @xmath7 , so that @xmath8 a typical choice for @xmath9 is right ascension and declination .",
    "then we can write the velocity vector @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the components of the velocity , relative to the observer in @xmath1 , in the ( positively oriented ) orthonormal basis @xmath14 , with @xmath15 we recall the definitions of optical and radar attributables . from a short arc of optical observations of a moving body @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 ,",
    "it is possible to compute an * optical attributable * @xmath19 representing the angular position and velocity of the body at a mean time @xmath20 ( see @xcite , ) . in this case",
    "the radial distance and velocity @xmath21 are completely undetermined and are the missing quantities to define an orbit for the body .    from a set of radar observations of a moving body @xmath22 , with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , it is possible to compute a * radar attributable * , i.e. a vector @xmath23 at time @xmath24 ( see ) . here",
    "@xmath25 are the unknowns needed to define an orbit .",
    "we call * attributable coordinates * the vector @xmath26 representing the position and velocity of the body as seen from the observer at time @xmath20 .",
    "given two optical attributables @xmath27 at epochs @xmath28 , we assume they belong to the same observed body and write 4 scalar algebraic equations for the topocentric distances @xmath29 and the radial velocities @xmath30 at the two epochs .",
    "we use some of the algebraic integrals of the kepler problem , i.e. the angular momentum @xmath31 , and the laplace - lenz vector @xmath32 .",
    "the expressions of these integrals as functions of the topocentric distance and radial velocity @xmath33 are given below .",
    "angular momentum : @xmath34 where @xmath35    laplace - lenz s vector : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a positive constant if we deal with objects orbiting around the sun ; @xmath38 for satellites of the earth . ] and @xmath39    if @xmath0 corresponds to the center of the sun , then we use interpolated values for @xmath40 , as suggested by poincar @xcite . if @xmath0 corresponds to the center of the earth we do not apply this method .",
    "these dynamical quantities give 6 scalar integrals of the motions : only 5 are mutually independent , in fact we have @xmath41 .",
    "since we have 4 unknowns , generically we only need 4 scalar conservation laws to define a finite number of solutions .",
    "we select the conservation of the angular momentum vector and of a particular component of the laplace - lenz vector .",
    "the choice of the latter integral presents a substantial advantage with respect to the use of the energy , as in : the difference between the two choices will be discussed later .",
    "we use the notation above , with index 1 or 2 referring to the epoch .",
    "if @xmath42 , @xmath43 correspond to the same observed object , then the angular momentum vectors at the two epochs must coincide : @xmath44 equation ( [ angmomeq ] ) can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 following we eliminate the variables @xmath47 and obtain the equation @xmath48 we can write the left - hand side of ( [ eq_am_scal ] ) as @xmath49 with @xmath50 @xmath51 the radial velocities are given by @xmath52    also the laplace - lenz vectors at the two epochs must coincide .",
    "we equate the projection of both vectors along @xmath53 : @xmath54 actually the projection of @xmath55 along @xmath56 is particularly simple : @xmath57 thus ( [ projlenz ] ) becomes @xmath58 after substituting ( [ rhojdot ] ) , this is an algebraic equation in @xmath59 . rearranging the terms in ( [ eq_lenz ] ) and squaring we",
    "obtain @xmath60\\cdot\\vvec\\right\\}^2 = 0 \\ . \\label{polyp}\\ ] ] this is a polynomial equation of degree 10 in @xmath29 : in fact , the projection @xmath61 does not depend on @xmath62 and , in the difference @xmath63 , the second degree term in @xmath64 ( i.e. @xmath65 ) cancels out .    therefore , to solve the linkage problem",
    ", we can consider the polynomial system @xmath66 with total degree 20 .",
    "this shows the advantage of this method compared with the one in , which gives total degree 48 .      to compute the solutions of ( [ intersec ] )",
    "we define an algorithm similar to the one in @xcite , @xcite , . by grouping the monomials with the same power of @xmath67 we write @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 for some univariate polynomial coefficients @xmath71 and constants @xmath72 .",
    "we consider the resultant @xmath73 of @xmath74 with respect to @xmath67 : it is generically a degree 20 polynomial defined as the determinant of the @xmath75 sylvester matrix @xmath76 the positive real roots of @xmath73 are the only possible values of @xmath77 for a solution @xmath78 of ( [ intersec ] ) .",
    "the resultant of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath77 leads to compute determinants of @xmath80 matrices , thus the elimination of @xmath67 is more convenient .",
    "on the other hand , if we project the laplace - lenz vectors on @xmath81 , it is better to eliminate @xmath77 .",
    "following , we compute the coefficients of @xmath73 by an evaluation - interpolation method based on the fft , and then the roots @xmath82 of @xmath73 by the algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the computation of the preliminary orbits is concluded as follows :    * solve the equation @xmath83 ; * discard spurious solutions , that is pairs @xmath78 solving ( [ polyp ] ) but not ( [ eq_lenz ] ) ; * compute the values of @xmath84 by ( [ rhojdot ] ) ; * write the corresponding orbital elements .",
    "the related epochs are @xmath85 , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the velocity of light ( aberration correction ) .",
    "assume we have a * radar attributable * @xmath88 at epoch @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce the variables @xmath89 so that @xmath90    the angular momentum as a function of @xmath91 is @xmath92 where @xmath93    suppose we have a radar attributable @xmath94 at time @xmath95 and an optical attributable @xmath96 at time @xmath97 .",
    "equating the angular momentum vectors @xmath98 and @xmath99 at the two epochs we obtain a polynomial system of 3 equations in the 4 unknowns @xmath100 : @xmath101 the system is linear in @xmath102 . by solving for these variables",
    "we obtain @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "equating the expressions of the laplace - lenz vectors at the two epochs , and projecting along @xmath106 , yields @xmath107\\cdot\\vvec = \\\\ & = & \\bigl[\\bigl(\\vert{\\dot{\\bf r}}_1\\vert^2 -   \\frac{\\mu}{\\vert{{\\bf r}}_1\\vert}\\bigr){{\\bf r}}_1 - ( { \\dot{\\bf r}}_1\\cdot{{\\bf r}}_1){\\dot{\\bf r}}_1\\bigr]\\cdot\\vvec +   ( { \\dot{\\bf r}}_2\\cdot{{\\bf r}}_2)({\\dot{\\bf r}}_2\\cdot\\vvec ) = 0\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath108 does not depend on @xmath62 and is linear in @xmath67 ( cfr . with ( [ rdotv ] ) ) .",
    "thus , after substituting @xmath109 , @xmath110 from ( [ linsol ] ) , the terms @xmath111 and @xmath112\\cdot\\vvec$ ] are polynomials of degree 4 in @xmath67 .",
    "we obtain a univariate polynomial equation with degree 4 in @xmath67 , which admits explicit solutions . for each positive root @xmath113",
    "we can compute orbital elements at epochs @xmath114 using ( [ linsol ] ) .",
    "we list the cases that make the equations of the linkage degenerate .    0.3 cm optical case + the quadratic form ( [ quad_form ] ) is completely degenerate if @xmath115 for a discussion on the geometric meaning of these conditions see .",
    "another degenerate case occurs if @xmath116 . in the case of space debris",
    "this corresponds to a zenith observation .",
    "0.3 cm radar - optical case + system ( [ linmixed ] ) degenerates if @xmath117 this occurs when @xmath118 , or @xmath119 , or when @xmath120 is in the orbital plane ( orthogonal to @xmath121 ) .",
    "another degeneration occurs when @xmath116 , as in the optical case .",
    "let @xmath122 be the vector of two optical attributables and @xmath123 its covariance matrix . for each solution @xmath124 of the linkage problem",
    "@xmath125 we can compute the cartesian coordinates @xmath126 , @xmath127 at epochs @xmath128 , and their covariance matrices @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
