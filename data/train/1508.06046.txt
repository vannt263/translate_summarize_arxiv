    "however , a common simple picture is that proto - clusters become unbound when supernova feedback ( snf ) ejects the remaining cluster gas , if the gas fraction at that time is too high ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "if true , that might suggest that that gc formation is linked to regions of very high star - formation efficiency ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "it has been argued that young clusters lose their gas too early to be consistent with that picture ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the inferred ages of known gas - free clusters which are most similar to young gcs are still broadly consistent with the model we present @xcite , especially given the likely uncertainty in determining their ages ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , if proto - gcs are shown to always lose their gas before snf occurs then our model would not work .    in this letter",
    "we examine whether x - ray binary ( xb ) feedback ( xbf ) might affect the survival probabilites of young star clusters , since black - hole ( bh ) xbs should sometimes form before significant snf occurs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "bhxbs may decrease the gas fraction inside the proto - cluster , and so could increase the effective star formation efficiency before sne eject the remaining gas .",

    "stochastic galaxy - to - galaxy variation in xbf may help to explain some of the diversity in dwarf galaxy populations @xcite .",
    "here we argue that the influence of bhxbs on the survival of proto - gcs might explain why the gc formation efficency  @xmath2 , i.e. , the fraction of stellar mass which stays in bound clusters  apparently increases at lower metallicity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a change in @xmath2 is necessary to explain why the gcs in massive , metal - rich galaxies are predominantly metal - poor @xcite .",
    "the present - day observed @xmath2 presumably represents both formation - epoch processes and subsequent cluster disruption ( see , e.g. , @xcite and figure [ fig : schematic ] ) . unless the other processes which affect @xmath2 are strongly metallicity dependent then the model we present should be able to accommodate them .",
    "we do not examine the formation of multiple stellar populations in gcs .",
    "@xcite have done so when considering single stellar - mass bhs which accrete from the proto - cluster gas . if bhxbs can affect the formation epoch of gcs , then they might somehow help to resolve this problem .",
    "section [ sec : input ] presents the background to this scenario .",
    "sections [ sec : toy ] and [ sec : bimodality ] investigate the idea using toy models .",
    "a key property of bhxbs for proto - gc survival is that bhxbs can be formed before sne eject the cluster gas .",
    "this is possible if bhs can form relatively quietly , from stars more massive than those which dominate the energetic snf ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "@xcite find young bhxbs turn on @xmath34 myr after a starburst ; their models match the observed luminous xb distribution in the cartwheel galaxy .",
    "the expected time available for such bhxbs to act before strong snf depends on whether bh formation `` by fallback '' is sufficiently quiet to avoid sudden gas ejection , or only formation of bhs by direct collapse .",
    "those options roughly correspond to initial single - star masses above @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ( a more complete picture would be metallicity - dependent  see , e.g. , @xcite  and binarity adds further complexity ) .",
    "nonetheless , by the time sne explosively eject gas from the proto - gc , one or more bhxbs might well have had @xmath315 myr to reduce the gas fraction inside the cluster , which is a signficant qualitative difference between those proto - clusters in which an early bhxb does form and those in which one does not @xcite .",
    "there are exceptions to the above broad statements .",
    "for example , @xcite predict that @xmath60.1 per cent of nss form within 5 myr of star formation due to binary interactions , presumably in energetic sne . even rarer",
    "are bh - forming events probably associated with long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and classes of `` super - luminous '' supernovae ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our toy models neglect these unusual events , although they may be sufficiently common to affect detailed cluster demographics .",
    "another complication is the possibility of age spreads larger than @xmath31 myr within cluster stellar populations .",
    "since the expectation is that denser clusters should have smaller age spreads @xcite , this may make gas ejection by bhxbs relatively less important for less dense clusters than for proto - gcs .      for a bhxb to significantly alter the distribution of gas within a protocluster",
    ", the energy input must be at least comparable to the binding energy of the gas . adopting a binding energy @xmath7 for that gas of order @xmath8=@xmath9 , ( where @xmath10 is the fraction of the total cluster mass  @xmath11  in gas , and",
    "@xmath12 is a characteristic radius for the cluster ) we estimate the binding energy of the gas as :    @xmath13    using those characteristic values for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath14 leads to a ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath15  the energy input from xbf of luminosity @xmath16 over time @xmath17  of order :    @xmath18    which suggests that a single luminous xb could significantly affect the gas within a young cluster , even for feedback efficiencies as low as a few percent .      another argument in favour of the importance of xbf in young gcs is that the gas - rich environments of embedded clusters might be compton - thick .",
    "this would help to trap the accretion luminosity .",
    "we take a column density of @xmath19 as sufficient for compton - thickness , or a surface density @xmath20 of slightly above @xmath21 . scaling to this value",
    ", we find :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the hydrogen gas mass .",
    "so for gas fractions of @xmath3 90% ( 99% ) , proto - clusters with initial _",
    "stellar _ masses above @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) may well be compton - thick .",
    "@xcite reported six heavily obscured luminous x - ray sources consistent with being inside dense , gas - rich , star - forming clouds in the antennae .",
    "those may well represent less extreme examples of such embedded systems .      for studying gc survival , we only consider the most rapidly - formed bhxbs  those which switch on before strong snf . here",
    "we assume that the formation of those pre - snf bhxbs can be treated as a poisson process .",
    "at solar metallicity we take the mean population from the calculations of @xcite , using the predicted number of bhxbs more luminous than @xmath26 at an age of @xmath35 myr . at that time , for a population which will eventually produce @xmath27 core - collapse sne , their least optimistic model predicts @xmath31 such bhxb , and their more optimistic models @xmath310 of them .",
    "we adopt an intermediate value of 3 ( simply normalised to @xmath28 of stars per core - collapse sn ) , so models allow at least half an order - of - magnitude of freedom in either direction in this bhxb frequency .    at `` low metallicity ''  roughly below 0.1 @xmath29  we assume that the incidence of suitable luminous young bhxbs is 10 times higher than at @xmath30 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an increase was strongly expected by models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this metallicity dependence likely does not only arise from a change in which single stars would form bhs , since other effects are important in forming a system containing a bh in a close binary . in particular , early envelope loss ",
    "with respect to the nuclear evolution of the stellar core  can lead a massive star to leave a ns remnant rather than a bh ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , at sufficiently low metallicity , massive stars burn helium before expanding to become giants , hence their common - envelope phases tend to happen later in their nuclear evolution , hence they are more likely to form bhs in close binaries",
    ". this effect may produce a sudden increase in suitable bhxb formation below the appropriate threshold metallicity ( which might be significant for  [ sec : bimodality ] ) .",

    "the dotted curves ( labelled @xmath41 ) represent model predictions immediately after gas ejection .",
    "the solid coloured histograms present the mass functions after later mass loss ( @xmath42 , as labelled ) .",
    "the dashed purple lines show inferred slopes for metal - rich and metal - poor cluster populations from @xcite.,width=302 ]",
    "we now use toy models to demonstrate potential consequences of this scenario .",
    "these adopt a very simple set of assumptions , including that star formation efficiency is so low that sn - driven ejection of the remaining gas would normally unbind a young cluster .",
    "so a cluster survives to become a gc _ if and only if _ a bhxb acts first . in the terminology of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , we assume that all stars form in clusters ( @xmath43 ; though some clusters may have very low mass ) , and that if a bhxb is formed before snf the cluster remains bound ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "first we neglect later disruption processes ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "then then probability of a cluster remaining bound is the poisson probability of that mass of stars forming one or more bhxbs before snf ( taken from  [ sec : poisson ] ) . in the statistical limit",
    ", this probability is also the fraction of clusters which remain bound with that particular initial mass ( and metallicity ) .",
    "figure [ fig : survival ] presents outcomes from such probability calculations .",
    "the upper panel shows survival fractions for given initial cluster masses , and the lower panel the effect on a population of clusters with a given initial cluster mass function ( icmf ) .",
    "the `` initial cluster masses '' are stellar masses , not including gas .",
    "since the survival fraction is very low below the mass range which typically produces gcs we conclude that , if this toy model is inappropriate below the mass range which produces gcs , it would only moderately affect broad predictions .",
    "figure [ fig : efficiency ] compares integrated survival efficiencies to present - day inferred @xmath2 values ( from * ? ? ?",
    "the upper and lower panels demonstrate the effect of varying the uncertain upper and lower bounds of the integral over the icmf .",
    "the values predicted for @xmath2 , along with the difference between @xmath2 for metal - rich and metal - poor clusters , appear at least order - of magnitude consistent with observationally - derived values in most of the parameter space .",
    "where the predicted @xmath2 appears too high , this allows freedom for unclustered star formation and additional gc disruption mechanisms .",
    "so it seems preferable if the icmf flattens or truncates at a few hundred solar masses or more .",
    "this constraint would relax slightly if suitable bhxbs are more common than we have assumed ; we repeat that in bhxb models there is at least half an order - of - magnitude of freedom to allow this .      to our earlier assumptions",
    "we now add a parameterized version of later cluster evolution ( due to @xcite , via @xcite ) .",
    "for this we use a monte carlo approach , randomly drawing clusters from a schechter - function icmf and deciding whether each cluster remains bound based on the same bhxb formation probabilities as above .",
    "each of the surviving clusters is then assumed to lose a mass  denoted by @xmath42  after the formation epoch @xcite .    due to the large dynamic ranges , for the distributions in figure [ fig : withdelta ] we drew @xmath46 primordial clusters from the icmf . over the mass range in fig .",
    "[ fig : withdelta ] , assuming @xmath47 reduces @xmath2 by a factor of a few .",
    "this reproduces the gcmf turnover within our earlier model uncertainties .",
    "@xcite found that the bright end of the gc luminosity function is steeper for gc populations around less massive host galaxies ( which correlates with more metal - poor gc populations ) .",
    "figure [ fig : withdelta ] displays the power law index ( @xmath48 ) inferred by @xcite for the upper mass function of those presumed metal - rich and metal - poor populations ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ) .",
    "the correspondence with this model seems at least intriguing .",
    "this qualitative effect also arises in our simplest toy model , as fig .",
    "[ fig : survival ] predicts that the upper mass function of bound gcs should be steeper for low - metallicity clusters .",
    "if the formation of appropriate bhxbs has a suitable metallicity dependence , then this scenario might explain the metallicity bimodality of galactic gcs .",
    "it is not certain whether the commonly - observed colour bimodality of extragalactic gcs indicates a similar metallicity bimodality @xcite .",
    "a metallicity - dependent @xmath51 would produce a gc metallicity bimodality when the host galaxy s stellar metallicity distribution @xmath52 was appropriate ",
    "i.e.  only if @xmath53 leads to a bimodal distribution .",
    "unfortunately , robust @xmath54 distributions for entire galaxies , including their halo populations , are difficult to obtain .    here",
    "we show that a simple @xmath55 function , guided by our model , could reproduce a gc metallicity bimodality from a non - bimodal @xmath52 .",
    "we assume two regimes of constant @xmath56 ",
    "one at low @xmath37 and one around @xmath57  matched by a transition region , expressed as :    @xmath58 \\right ) \\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 represents the amount by which @xmath59 increases at low-@xmath37 , @xmath60 gives the `` sharpness '' of the transition between the @xmath57 and low-@xmath37 regimes , and @xmath61 indicates the metallicity around which that transition occurs .    for the upper row of figure [ fig : bimod ] , we assume a @xmath52 constructed to approximate the @xmath52 distribution of ngc 1399 in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "there we keep @xmath52 fixed , and show cluster metallicity distributions for different values of @xmath12 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "our adopted values of @xmath12 and @xmath61 are similar to those which we have previously suggested are expected ( i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively ; see  [ sec : poisson ] ) . from this @xmath52",
    "we can recover a bimodality in cluster metallicity , and the qualitative result is not affected by small variations in @xmath60 . the gradual metallicity dependence from @xcite for",
    "_ generic _ high - mass xbs would not produce a bimodality , as shown in the central panel .",
    "however , the systems involved in our scenario are a very specific subset of young bhxbs . moreover , there are indications that a sharp transition is at least plausible ( see   [ sec : poisson ] and @xcite ) .",
    "the bottom row of figure [ fig : bimod ] demonstrates changing @xmath52 with fixed model parameters ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) .",
    "this illustrates that the model does not predict that every galaxy must have a bimodal cluster metallicity distribution ( for which see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the peaks of the gc metallicity distribution are affected by the underlying @xmath52 .    when future observations provide reliable @xmath52 distributions for a significant sample of galaxies , this should enable strong constraints on our model . if eq.[eq : tanh_function ] provides a good functional form for @xmath55  and if @xmath2 is _ only _ a function of metallicity  then the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 should be universal constants .",
    "however , we expect that reality is more complicated .",
    "for example , this simplified model assumes that @xmath34  and hence @xmath2  has only two regimes ( @xmath57 and low-@xmath37 ) . at higher metallicities",
    "@xmath34 might well decrease further .",
    "indeed , for metallicities significantly above solar then single stars might no longer leave bh remnants at all ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the na - o and mg - al anticorrelations are exclusively associated with star clusters which stay bound , it would be elegant if these anticorrelations could be explained by the bhxbs which  in this model  allow clusters to stay bound .",
    "this speculation arose since the relevant nuclear reactions are high - energy proton capture reactions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and many bhxbs may be prolific sources of high - energy protons ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , even for assumptions which we expect are extremely optimistic , we have been unable to convince ourselves that a single bhxb would explain the observed abundance anomalies in an entire gc .",
    "nonetheless , variations on this mechanism may deserve further examination , perhaps involving other proton accelerators in these dense stellar systems .",
    "we have investigated a scenario in which young stellar clusters are able to survive as bound gcs _ only _ when feedback from bhxbs gradually decreases the gas fraction inside the cluster before energetic sne suddenly eject the remainder of the gas .",
    "several potential complications are ignored by our toy model . however , as long as the other processes which affect @xmath2 are largely metallicity - independent , this scenario may well have sufficient freedom to include them without losing its positive features .",
    "a minimal set of assumptions , combined with input numbers estimated from population models for suitable bhxbs , produces predictions consistent with observationally - inferred @xmath2 , including the increase in @xmath2 at low metallicity .",
    "we therefore suggest that more detailed study of early feedback from bhxbs in proto - gcs may be important for trying to understand gc populations .",
