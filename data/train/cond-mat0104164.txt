    "statistical mechanical approaches to the problems in information science are employed frequently , and it is now known that such methods are very useful in various problems @xcite . among such problems ,",
    "the image restoration problem has been investigated both theoretically and practically @xcite .",
    "we usually send and receive the information by means of various networks .",
    "the information is the data of document , sound , picture , and so on .",
    "however , it is generally impossible for a receiver to receive complete transmitted data when a sender transmits something , because the data are transmitted through a noisy channel .",
    "if we restrict the type of data to that of the picture , the original image is affected by some kind of noise when it is sent by a defective fax , a fickle e - mail , etc .",
    "when we receive such a corrupted image , we have to convert it using some kind of filter to obtain the original image .",
    "basically it is the image restoration problem to estimate the original data ( the original image ) from the received , corrupted data ( the degraded image ) .",
    "we may regard the digital picture as a discrete spin system .",
    "for example , a black and white image ( wbi ) corresponds to an ising spin system by identifying the white color with @xmath7 and the black with @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the theory of image restoration is constructed by considering that two axes of the plane , @xmath9-axis and @xmath10-axis , correspond to two axes of time in the stochastic process .",
    "that is , the markov process that the event occurs at a specific time is affected by what happened at neighboring pixels at a one - time step before .",
    "there are mainly two standard approaches to the image restoration by means of the method of statistical mechanics .",
    "one is called the maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimation in which the estimation of the original image is given by maximizing a posterior probability distribution .",
    "this estimation will be seen to correspond to a search of the ground state of spin system described by the effective hamiltonian in the context of statistical mechanics .",
    "another is the estimation in which we regard the expectation value with respect to the maximized marginal posterior probability at each site in thermal equilibrium as the original image and is called the maximum posteriori marginal ( mpm ) estimation .",
    "this estimation is also called the finite temperature restoration .",
    "therefore , the mpm estimation includes the map estimation . among the two estimations ,",
    "it was proposed by marroquin et al @xcite that the mpm estimation gives better performance than the map estimation .",
    "nishimori and wong @xcite proved this fact for black and white images using a rigorous inequality .",
    "with respect to the gray - scale image , the same has been shown by tanaka @xcite from a different viewpoint .",
    "not only black and white images but also gray scale images are actively investigated by many people in the field of statistical mechanics .",
    "restoration of gray scale image using chiral potts spin @xcite may not be appropriate since chiral potts spin can not express the distance among different states . however @xmath0-ising spin @xcite",
    "can express the gray scale level at least .",
    "restoration of gray scale image using @xmath0-ising spin was first investigated by inoue and carlucci @xcite .    inspired by their studies ,",
    "we investigate the restoration of the gray scale image expressed by the @xmath0-ising spin when it is decomposed into the ising spin before transmission . in this method ,",
    "the gray scale image is decomposed into binary data by means of the method of threshold division before it is transmitted .",
    "then the bit - decomposed data is transmitted through a noisy channel .",
    "therefore the effects of noise is different from those in the @xmath0-ising form .",
    "we show how well the original image is restored in our method in comparison to the restoration using the @xmath0-ising form .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we explain the general formulation of image restoration and the method of threshold division . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the static properties of image restoration in the infinite - range model . in sec .",
    "iv , we verify the result of the infinite - range model in realistic pictures by means of monte carlo simulation . in sec .",
    "v , standard image is restored by the method of mean - field annealing .",
    "the performance of restoration in our method is compared with that using the @xmath0-ising form .",
    "the final section is denoted to summary and discussions .",
    "a gray scale image is represented by a set @xmath11 of fixed values .",
    "the variable @xmath12 takes an integer value between @xmath13 and @xmath1 . even in black and white image",
    "in addition to gray scale image , most of natural images have nontrivial structures generally .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to discuss the property of a given specific natural image exactly .",
    "nevertheless we may notice that an eminent property of natural images is local smoothness .",
    "therefore we assume that the original image is generated by the boltzmann probability represented by the following : @xmath14 , \\label{ir1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 represents interacting sites and @xmath16 is the coordination number .",
    "@xmath17 is the normalization constant , and @xmath18 is the inverse temperature to generate the original image . if @xmath19 is large , an original image with many clusters consisting of the same value is generated .",
    "a degraded image is generated by sending data of the original image through a noisy channel .",
    "we consider two kinds of noise .",
    "one is the binary noise caused by a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) and another is the gaussian noise caused by the gaussian channel ( gc ) .      in the gaussian channel ,",
    "the output @xmath20 for an input @xmath12 is a gaussian random variable with mean @xmath21 and variance @xmath22 .",
    "the probability distribution of output given the input @xmath23 is written as @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{ir2}\\ ] ] the degraded image @xmath25 is generated by this probability distribution .",
    "according to the bayes formula , the posterior probability @xmath26 that the estimate of source sequence , namely the restored image , is @xmath27 , provided that the output is @xmath28 , is given as @xmath29    since we can use the degraded image only and do not know the other information of original image , we introduced the model prior @xmath30 to represent a priori knowledge on natural   represented by equation ( [ ir1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore prior parameters @xmath19 and @xmath31 to control the generation of original image and degraded image , respectively , are unknown quantities .",
    "accordingly , we have to use the so - called hyper - parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 instead of prior parameters @xmath19 and @xmath31 .",
    "then , controlling these hyper - parameters , we can obtain the optimal restored image .",
    "when binary data @xmath34 takes @xmath13 or @xmath35 , the type of noise can also be binary .",
    "in such a case , a pixel of the original image is flipped with the probability @xmath36 , the error rate .",
    "the error probabilities of flipping the signal + 1 to 0 and 0 to + 1 are the same .",
    "the probability distribution of this output @xmath37 is expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath38 , \\label{ir4}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left [ 1+{\\rm e}^{\\beta_{\\tau}}\\right]^{n}. \\nonumber \\label{ir5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath40 is defined by @xmath36 becomes @xmath41 the posterior probability in this case is @xmath42      next , we discuss the method to estimate the original image from the preceding posterior probability distribution and to evaluate the restored image which is obtained by such estimations .",
    "we consider the marginal distribution obtained from the posterior probability distribution equation ( [ ir3 ] ) ( or ( [ ir7 ] ) ) to estimate the original ] using this marginal probability distribution , we calculate the local magnetization at a site @xmath43 as given by @xmath44 since the above expectation value is a continuous real number , we need to change it into an integer by means of the following function @xmath45 : because the original image consists of the discrete value in digital images , the restored image is the estimation of original image should , properly , take the discrete value .",
    "@xmath46 } \\label{ir10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a real number @xmath47 is translated into the closest integer .",
    "then we regard the above discrete value @xmath48 as the value of @xmath43-th pixel for restored image at finite @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the finite temperature process .",
    "+ in the map estimation , the estimation of the original image is regarded as the set @xmath49 which maximizes the posterior probability distribution ( eq.s ( [ ir3]),([ir7 ] ) ) . in other words , it is the set that minimizes the energy of the system described by the hamiltonian @xmath50 or @xmath51 and is actually the ground state .",
    "consequently , the above estimation corresponds to the map estimation when @xmath52 @xmath53 keeping @xmath54 constant .",
    "it is very important to evaluate the performance of restoration by means of these estimations . for this purpose",
    ", we assume that we know the original image and evaluate the performance of restoration by measuring the distance between the original and the restored images given by the above estimation . in order to measure the distance between the original and the restored images , we use the following mean square error as the distance , @xmath55^{2 } , \\label{ir11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "whose value depends on the hyper - parameters @xmath33 and @xmath32 appearing in the thermal average .",
    "we next discuss the restoration of gray - scale image using bit - decomposed data .",
    "it is expected that the effects of noise on the binary data is lower than that on the @xmath0-value data for image restoration : the binary data is estimated easily compared with the @xmath0-value data because of the explicit representation . since the original image is estimated by using the information of degraded image , the performance of restoration ought to be deeply affected by the effects of noise .",
    "therefore we expect that the performance of restoration is improved by using the binary data instead of the @xmath0-value data .",
    "we generate binary data from @xmath0-value data using the @xmath0-ising form by means of the following function @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the threshold value and @xmath58 is the input data .",
    "we obtain @xmath59 sets of binary data from a @xmath0-value data by using this function with threshold value changed from 1 to @xmath1 .",
    "this method is called the _ threshold division_. for example , we consider a set with @xmath60 ( @xmath13 , or @xmath35 , or @xmath61 ) and six pixels : @xmath62 .",
    "if we insert this set into the above function with the threshold value @xmath63 , the binary set @xmath64 is generated .",
    "the set @xmath65 is also generated when @xmath66 .",
    "thus two binary sets @xmath64 and @xmath65 are generated from the @xmath67-value set @xmath62 .",
    "these operations are depicted in fig .",
    "the expression of binary data @xmath68 produced by this method is different from the usual binary notation because the relation between a @xmath0-value data and ( @xmath1 ) sets of binary data becomes @xmath69 we call binary data generated by this threshold division the _ bit - decomposed data _ ( bdd ) .    next , the process in the restoration of gray - scale image using the bit - decomposed data becomes the following .",
    "decompose a @xmath0-value data ( original image ) into ( @xmath1 ) sets of binary data before transmission .",
    "2 .   send ( @xmath1 ) sets of binary data through a noisy channel .",
    "3 .   receive ( @xmath1 ) sets of corrupted binary data ( degraded image ) .",
    "4 .   restore the original image from the degraded image .    obviously , this procedure is different from the method in which the raw @xmath0-value data are sent .    following the general formulation mentioned in the previous section , we formulate the above process .",
    "the posterior probability necessary for restoration is the following @xmath70 where we used @xmath71 to denote the dynamical variables used to estimate @xmath23 .",
    "the notation @xmath72 is the estimation of decomposed data @xmath73 .",
    "the notation @xmath74 is the degraded binary data .",
    "the relation between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the same as that between @xmath12 and @xmath73 ( eq .",
    "( [ thresh1 ] ) ) .",

    "that is to say , the effects of noise in our method are different from the case where the raw @xmath0-ising data are sent .",
    "in this section , we discuss the restoration of the gray - scale image in the infinite - range model ( mean - field model ) . since the infinite - range model is the model in which all pixels interact mutually , it is not useful for restoration of real images directly .",

    "we can simply investigate the tolerance of our method and @xmath0-ising form against noise by comparing @xmath170 and @xmath171 cases .",
    "the performance of restoration is shown in table [ tab - mf3 ] and the resultant image is presented in fig .",
    "[ stand9 ] for the case of `` lena '' .",
    "the performance of restoration is clearly worse than that in the previous case for all pictures , and the difference of performance between our method and the @xmath0-ising form is clear .",
    "moreover , the restoration using our method gives better performance than that using the @xmath0-ising form in standard image `` house '' .",
    "the result is different from that when @xmath172 . in the @xmath0-ising form ,",
    "large clusters remain in the restored image as in fig .",
    "[ stand9 ] .",
    "accordingly we conclude that the restoration using the bit - decomposed data is not affected by the noise compared with that using the @xmath0-ising form in this case .",
    "consequently we found that the restoration using our method is more efficient than that in the @xmath0-ising form in original images where the nearest neighboring pixels take the close values .",
    "the reason is that to eliminate the added noise is more significant than the information of the original image in such images .",
    "regardless of the @xmath0-ising form and our method , the restoration of such images tend to give good performance compared with that of other images in the image restoration using the method of statistical mechanics .",
    "moreover , our method can give the adequate restored image in original images `` chair '' , `` girl '' and `` house '' even if the noise is strong to a certain extent : for example , @xmath169 .    finally , we try to restore the original image by using the composition of our method and the @xmath0-ising form .",
    "two processes are considered in restoration using the composition .",
    "one is the method of restoration where the original image is restored from @xmath1 sets of binary degraded images which are generated from the received , degraded @xmath0-value image by the method of threshold division .",
    "another is the method of restoration where the original image is restored by using the @xmath0-ising form after translating @xmath1 sets of binary degraded images into a @xmath0-value degraded image .",
    "these restoration processes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - qb ] .",
    "the second process is not efficient in the restoration of gray - scale image because the performance of restoration is worse than that both using our method and the @xmath0-ising form . on the other hand ,",
    "the first process gives interesting results as in table [ tab - qb ] when @xmath170 .",
    "seeing in table [ tab - qb ] , we find that this method gives better performance than our method and the @xmath0-ising form for all standard images : `` chair '' , `` girl '' , `` house '' , `` lena '' and `` mandrill '' .",
    "the restoration of standard images using this method for the case of `` lena '' is shown in fig .",
    "[ lena - qb ] .",
    "this idea that , after a @xmath0-value data are received , they are decomposed into binary data has been already used in the field of engineering .",
    "the filter is called the _ stack filter _ @xcite which works on decomposed binary data after reception .",
    "the stack filter by means of the method of statistical mechanics as the first process gives better performance than the other two methods , but the theoretical framework is not clear . because we have to assume the noisy process matching the degraded data in the bayesian viewpoint , it is very difficult for us to estimate the noisy channel matching such binary data .",
    "accordingly , it is well possible that the hyper - parameter @xmath33 can not be estimated appropriately for the hyper - parameters estimation in the stack filter by means of the method of statistical mechanics .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the restoration of gray - scale image using the bit - decomposed data instead of the conventional @xmath0-ising form and found the conditions that our method is more efficient than the method of the @xmath0-ising form .    in the infinite - range model , we analyzed the image restoration when the original image is affected by the gaussian noise , and obtained the static properties of image restoration . in order to obtain the averaged performance , we calculated the restoration of gray - scale image by means of the replica method .",
    "then we found that the mean square error has a minimum at the finite temperature for any ratio of the hyper - parameters @xmath127 .",
    "however , when the noise rate is extremely large , the minimum sinks under the mean square error @xmath173 in the high temperature limit .",
    "in other words , we can only obtain the restored image in which all states appear with equal probability as the optimal restored image when the original image is very corrupted .",
    "the best performance of restoration is given at the temperature at which the original image is generated , when the ratio of hyper - parameters corresponds to that of the prior parameters .",
    "this result is also common between the ising spin and the @xmath0-ising spin cases .",
    "furthermore , we obtained the quantitative result that the performance of restoration using our method is better than that using the @xmath0-ising form when @xmath174 .",
    "we analyzed the restoration of realistic images in two dimensions by means of monte carlo method and the mean - field annealing approximately . using monte carlo method",
    ", we confirmed the result of the infinite - range model that the mean square error gives the optimal minimum value at the temperature corresponding to the source temperature when the ratio of hyper - parameters corresponds to prior parameters for a snap - shot of the @xmath0-ising model for @xmath175 and @xmath165 .",
    "we restored five standard images by means of the mean - field annealing and found that the restoration using our method is better than that using the @xmath0-ising form in the original images where keeping the information of original image is not significant compared with the eliminating the added noise as `` chair '' and `` girl '' .",
    "the reason is that the effects of noise in our method contain the effect of smoothing .",
    "however , our method is not efficient in images which need information of the original image strongly .",
    "thus there are simply two types in natural images .",
    "one is the image which consists of a little long edges and large surfaces , and those images depend on a basic and common property of natural image strongly .",
    "another is the image which has many short edges and small clusters , and it is difficult to distinguish whether the original or degraded images in such images . therefore not only corrupted parts but correct parts may be destroyed by the effect of smoothing in such images . in restoration of images by means of the method of statistical mechanics , the effect of smoothing is strong compared with keeping the information of original image that the degraded image contains because we use it as common property of natural images .",
    "therefore , we need some additional information on the original image .    furthermore , we found also that the restoration using our method is not affected by noise compared with that using the @xmath0-ising form .",
    "one of the reasons is due to that the output , namely the degraded data , takes the close value to input data by the effects of noise in our method .",
    "this is the most significant property of our method .",
    "we expect that the restoration using our method gives further better performance when @xmath0-value is large .",
    "because we could not distinguish visually the difference between close values with increasing the gray - scale level ( @xmath0-value ) , the effect of noise may be suppressed visually .",
    "accordingly , we may be obtain the restored image that looks closer to the original image intuitively .",
