    "in a seminal paper published a quarter - century ago , krumhansl and schrieffer @xcite explored the possibility that nonlinear excitations ( solitons ) might drive structural phase transitions .",
    "they succeeded in identifying signatures of `` domain walls ( dw ) '' in the thermodynamic properties of the one - dimensional @xmath0 model and gave a phenomenological account of a salient feature of structural phase transitions , the appearance of a central peak in the dynamical spectrum .",
    "however , important issues remained open .",
    "in particular , because the demonstration was limited to a system which does not exhibit a genuine ( i.e. finite - temperature ) thermodynamic phase transition , there was no possibility to explore the role of exact , or nearly exact , nonlinear field configurations in determining critical behavior , static or dynamic .",
    "a class of one - dimensional models , which has been proposed to describe a wide variety of thermodynamic instabilities , such as thermal dna denaturation @xcite , wetting of interfaces @xcite , and other similar phenomena , could prove to be of interest in the above context .",
    "typically , such models include a short - range interaction between near neighbors , and an on - site potential with a single minimum and a flat - top ; in the context of dna denaturation , as the temperature increases , particles begin to access the region of the flat top at an increasing rate , until , at a finite temperature , a macroscopic instability occurs , with a divergence in the average displacement ( the `` effective length '' of the hydrogen bond which holds the double - stranded chain together ) , a divergent correlation length , and , generally , all the characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition . in the simplest case , that of a harmonic interaction and a morse on - site potential , the thermodynamics can be calculated exactly by using functional integral techniques @xcite and mapping the problem to the quantum mechanics of the morse oscillator .",
    "the thermodynamic transition corresponds to the quantum mechanics of the disappearance of the last bound state .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that soliton physics can offer a correct interpretation of such thermodynamic instabilities .",
    "in particular , a relatively brief calculation can show us _",
    "why _ and _ when _ a thermodynamic transition occurs .",
    "the logic can be summarized as follows : an exact , static nonlinear configuration of the continuum field can be found , which `` interpolates '' between the low- and the high - temperature phase .",
    "we interpret this to a be a dw .",
    "the total energy of the configuration diverges , because each site which is in the high - temperature phase contributes a finite amount of bond ( and elastic ) energy .",
    "the infinity is in a sense a `` minimal requirement '' : as long as the dw energy is finite , no phase transition can occur in one dimension @xcite",
    ". a closer look at the properties of the dw is more revealing .",
    "in contrast to other klein - gordon field theories with a finite - energy kink , there is no zero - frequency goldstone mode .",
    "it costs energy to shift the position of dw so that it can include more sites at the high - temperature phase .",
    "conversely , there is an energy gain by `` zipping back '' to the low - temperature phase . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the picture must be corrected to include entropic effects .",
    "the `` phonon cloud '' which accompanies the dw provides an entropic gain which ultimately balances the energy cost of extending the dw to macroscopic scale .",
    "the formation of a thermally stable dw is thus seen to `` drive '' the instability . at higher temperatures , it is entropically advantageous for a dw to extend itself by `` unzipping '' more sites towards the high temperature phase .",
    "the picture sketched above , which concentrates entirely on the thermal stability of the nonlinear interface , is more than a qualitative nonlinear scenario .",
    "it provides an estimate of the transition temperature which ( i ) turns out to be exact within the continuum field framework and , ( ii ) can be _ nonperturbatively _ extended to describe lattice systems up to quite high levels of discretization .    the paper is structured as follows : section ii provides a full account of exact results for the model .",
    "this is important to establish notation and context for the discussion .",
    "moreover , although some results have appeared in the literature before , they are scattered in various sources ; in addition , results for the correlation function and the susceptibility are new and the calculation has not been reported elsewhere @xcite . section iii deals with the soliton physics of the transition . a brief discussion of results and further perspectives , with special emphasis to effects due to lattice discreteness , is given in section iv .",
