    "nova persei 1901 ( gk  per ) was discovered by anderson in 1901 february 21 at a visual magnitude of 2.7 . only one day before , its brightness must have been fainter than 12 mag @xcite .",
    "it reached the maximum light on february 22 when it was as bright as vega ( 0.2 mag ) .",
    "gk  per was the first object around which superluminal light echoes were detected ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the actual ejecta of the nova outburst was discovered in 1916 by @xcite and is still easily observable now : indeed , it is considered to be the longest lived and most energetic nova remnant ever found .    the earliest optical images of the remnant showed an emission only in the southwest ( sw ) side of the remnant ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "gradually more material became visible around the central source , however , the asymmetric nature of the remnant has remained .",
    "radio observations obtained during 19841986 showed that the sw quadrant of the remnant is the source of non - thermal ( synchrotron ) emission @xcite .",
    "this would be caused by particle acceleration and enhanced magnetic fields in a fast shock where the expelled matter is meeting some pre - existing material , most probably the result of previous mass ejections from the system , possibly an ancient planetary nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by the analysis of the x - ray emission from the remnant @xcite .",
    "a lumpy , highly asymmetric x - ray nebula is observed , with brightness enhancement in the sw quadrant and wing - like extensions in the southeast ( se ) and northwest ( nw ) directions . it is concluded that a density gradient in the circumstellar medium causes the expansion of the x - ray shell to be faster in the nw and se directions , reaching velocities as high as @xmath02600 - 2800  km  s@xmath1 , than toward the sw , where velocities are less than half of that , around @xmath01100  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this strong interaction is expected to cause deceleration of the expansion of the sw part of the outflow @xcite .    at a distance of half a kiloparsec (",
    "e.g. @xcite ) and with an expansion velocity of a thousand km  s@xmath1 , the apparent growth of the nebula is about one arcsec per year , which is easily resolvable from ground - based optical imagery even on a timescale of few months .",
    "therefore gk  per offers the opportunity to study the evolution of a stellar outflow in real - time , and to determine not only the expansion velocities but also their derivatives ( i.e. acceleration , thus the forces at work ) , or deviations from pure radial expansion , an important information that is generally not available for dynamical studies of astrophysical outflows . if the expansion in the plane of the sky is coupled with doppler shift velocities , information about five of the six dimensions of the phase - space is gained , and an almost complete dynamical picture can be drawn . for these reasons ,",
    "starting on 2004 we embarked in a program of frequent imaging monitoring of the expansion of the gk  per remnant .",
    "we present here the results of the work .",
    "doppler shift velocities of 217 knots from long - slit spectroscopy are combined with high - precision measurements of the motion in the plane of the sky for 282 knots .",
    "the latter ones are computed using good - quality , ground - based @xmath2+[nii ] images spanning 25 years , with a particularly intensive time coverage since 2004 .    at the beginning of the article",
    "we describe our data and archival data",
    ". then designations used in this article are given ( section  [ s - geom ] ) .",
    "proper motions and radial velocities for individual knots are discussed in section  [ s - pm ] and [ s - rv ] , and the kinematical analysis is presented in section  [ s - kinmod ] .",
    "section  [ s - br ] presents the brightness evolution of the nebula , and section  [ s - disc ] presents the discussion .",
    "most of the imaging was carried out at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) , la palma , spain .",
    "images were taken with the wide field camera ( wfc ) and a narrow band @xmath2 filter having a central wavelength of 6568    and a bandpass of 95   .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath4 pix@xmath1 .",
    "other images were taken with the andalucia faint object spectrograph and camera ( alfosc ) at the 2.6 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) of the orm . an @xmath2 filter ( 6577/180   ) was used , and the pixel scale was @xmath5 pix@xmath1 . both the int and not filters are broad enough to include the emission from the [ nii ] 6548    and 6583    doublet , which are the strongest optical emission lines in the ejecta , and to cover its whole radial velocity range ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "all images were obtained with a seeing better than 1.3 arcsec full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "we also searched for archival images of the nebula .",
    "int images obtained on 1999 @xcite with the wfc , and on 1987 @xcite with the prime focus cone unit ( pfcu , pixel scale @xmath7 pix@xmath1 ) were downloaded from the isaac newton group archive .",
    "the 1999 data have been obtained with the same filter as our recent int+wfc observations .",
    "the 1987 frame was observed in a broadband r filter .",
    "the [ nii ] hubble space telescope ( hst ) 1995 and 1997 images discussed by @xcite were downloaded from the mast public archive .",
    "they were obtained with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) : the relatively large remnant fills the field of view of the camera , and is sampled at a @xmath8 pix@xmath1 by the wf detectors , and @xmath9 pix@xmath1 by the pc ccd . in both epochs ,",
    "the filter f658n was used , which has a central wavelength 6590    and a bandpass of 22   .",
    "this is narrower than the range covered by the ejecta and some knots with the most extreme radial velocity shifts are missed .",
    "the digitized sky survey ( dss ) images from the palomar 48-inch samuel oschin telescope ( pal48 ) obtained on 1953 ( pixel scale @xmath10 pix@xmath1 ) and 1989 ( pixel scale @xmath11 pix@xmath1 ) were retrieved via the aladin interface . in both cases observations were done on red - sensitive photographic plates with a bandpass approximately equivalent to an r filter . in 1953",
    "a plate kodak 103a - e and in 1989 a iiiaf was used .",

    "they range from @xmath43 to @xmath44  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "given its roundish overall morphology , as a first approximation we consider the nebula of gk  per to be a quasi - spherical shell in which knots expand radially from the central star .",
    "this hypothesis is broadly consistent with the plot of the observed radial velocities @xmath28 of the knots as a function of their apparent distance from the central star ( figure  [ f - pm_vrad ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the two solid lines in the figure indicate the expected distance - velocity plot for spherical shells of radii of 35 and 55 arcsec , and expansion velocities of 400 and 1000  km  s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "most of the knots are comprised within these two limits , suggesting that the knots of the nebula of gk  per form a relatively thick shell expanding with a significant range of velocities .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the behavior of the proper motions @xmath22 .",
    "the component of the expansion velocity in the plane of the sky immediately follows from @xmath22 according to equation ( in convenient units ) @xmath45 = 4.74 \\cdot \\mu\\ [ ' ' \\ yr^{-1 } ] \\cdot d\\ [ pc],\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the distance to gk  per . for a distance of @xmath47 pc ( section [ s - kinmod ] ) , @xmath29 of the measured knots varies between 13 and 1005  km  s@xmath1 , and its variation with distance from the center is also consistent with a spherical thick shell model with parameters as described above ( figure  [ f - pm_vrad ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the combination of the velocity components in the plane of the sky and along the line of sight provides the velocity vectors of the knots ( see the right panel of the figure  [ f - geom ] ) once the distance to gk  per is fixed .",
    "we could measure both velocity components for 117 knots : their deprojected speed is @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the angle between the line of sight and the velocity vector ( as in figure  [ f - geom ] ) . assuming a purely radial expansion , @xmath30 is also the angle that the line joining the central star with a knot forms with the line of sight , @xmath31 in figure  [ f - geom ] .",
    "the deprojected distance from the center would therefore be @xmath50 , and its projection along the line of sight is @xmath51 .",
    "we define the sign of @xmath21 so that it is positive when a knot is approaching us ( i.e. blue - shifted ) and negative when it is receding ( red - shifted ) .",
    "we also define @xmath25 to be positive for all knots in the northern side of the nebula and negative for those in the southern half . with these notations , a representation of the `` depth '' of the nebula along the line of sight ( i.e. its extension along the @xmath21 direction ) is shown in figure  [ f - foldcut ] . in the figure ,",
    "the observer is on the right side , and the plane @xmath52 represents the folding of all planes perpendicular to the plane of the sky and passing through the central star and the knots considered ( right panel of figure  [ f - geom ] ) .",
    "99 knots with a computed error on @xmath26 smaller than 10 arcsec are plotted . as stated above",
    ", the extension of the nebula along @xmath21 depends on the adopted distance @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the distance value that better corresponds to an overall spherical shape of the nebula is our `` expansion - parallax '' determination of the distance to gk  per .",
    "the adopted value , estimated by visual inspection of the variation of the overall shape of the nebula as a function of @xmath46 , is 400@xmath330  pc .",
    "this is broadly equivalent to assuming that @xmath29 for knots at the outer apparent edge of the nebula is the same as @xmath28 for knots in the innermost regions .",
    "figure  [ f - hubble ] shows the relations between deprojected quantities , namely the speed @xmath27 and the distances @xmath26 from the central star . as in previous graphs , it confirms that the nova remnant is thick ( nearly a half of its outer radius ) and that the expansion speed of knots covers the significant range from 250 to 1100  km  s@xmath1 , with the majority of them having a speed between 600 and 1000  km  s@xmath1 . in the figure",
    ", we also indicate the expected relationship between velocity and distance for a ballistic ejection ( hubble - like flow ) with an age @xmath53=102.9  years , which is the time lapse between the nova maximum of 1901 feb 22 and our reference epoch of 2004 jan 29 .",
    "points above the solid line have a kinematical age smaller than @xmath53 , and those below the line have a larger kinematical age , which indicates that they suffered some deceleration in the course of the expansion . for comparison , in the figure we show as a dotted line also the relation expected for a ballistic expansion with an age of 140  years .",
    "the knots age is further investigated in the next section .",
    "a direct estimate of the kinematical age @xmath54 of each knot can be obtained from the proper motion measurements , according to @xmath55= \\frac { d\\ [ '' ] } { \\mu\\ [ ' ' \\ yr^{-1}]},\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the distance of the knot from the central star on the plane of the sky that we measured at our reference epoch ( see figure  [ f - geom ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ f - agepa ] we present the kinematical age computed in this way as a function of the knots position angle . in the figure ,",
    "only the 151 knots with an estimated error on the age smaller than 8 years , and with an apparent distance from the centre @xmath56  35  arcsec ( in order to focus on the directions close to the plane of the sky and minimize projection effects ) are included .",
    "ages vary between 96 and 170 years , the mean value , weighted by errors , being @xmath57 years .",
    "the horizontal line indicates the nova age @xmath53 , and shows that in general knots have suffered only a modest deceleration since their ejection .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the comparison between the knots speeds of up to 1100  km  s@xmath1  determined above ( figure  [ f - hubble ] ) , and an initial expansion of the outflow of @xmath01300  km  s@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the simplistic hypothesis of constant deceleration throughout the knots lifetime @xcite , their observed mean age of 118 years implies that the present - day average speed is 77%  of the original ejection velocity .",
    "the time @xmath58 for individual knots to decrease in speed by a factor of two would be 220 years . even for knots with an apparent age of 140 years ( the upper limit for the vast majority of points in figures  [ f - hubble ] and [ f - agepa ] ) , velocity would have decreased by only 42%  in the 102.9 years since the nova explosion , and @xmath58 would be 120 years .",
    "data therefore exclude the short timescale @xmath58=58  years estimated by @xcite .",
    "the calculations of @xcite were based on the measurement of the radius of the sw side of the nebula from images taken between 1917 and 1984 .",
    "these measurements were extended by @xcite , who analyzed them using a more physical model which considered the expansion of an isothermal or adiabatic shock created by the interaction of the expanding outflow with a tenuous circumstellar medium .",
    "such an analysis was further extended by @xcite with images taken till 2003 .",
    "we refrain from further extending the method , as we found that the measurement of the size of the nebula is highly subjective , owing to the difficulty in defining the nebular edge due to the lack of an abrupt fall of surface brightness , clumpiness ( which is enhanced by the better resolution of the recent images ) , and asymmetries . indeed ,",
    "our estimates of the size differ from those of @xcite and @xcite by up to several arcseconds , which prevents any detailed discussion or refinement of the results obtained by these authors .",
    "the proper motion measurements also allow us to measure any deviation from circular symmetry of the expansion pattern in the directions close to the plane of the sky .",
    "anisotropies along the line of sight depends on the adopted distance of the system , and indeed in the previous section we used the argument inversely , having minimized any anisotropy in order to estimate a distance to the system .    considering the data in figure  [ f - agepa ] ,",
    "the mean weighted age in the different quadrants is : @xmath59 yr ( ne , 34 knots ) , @xmath60 yr ( se , 45 knots ) , @xmath61 yr ( sw , 34 knots ) , and @xmath62 yr ( nw , 38 knots ) .",
    "we conclude that no strong evidence exists for deviations from the circular symmetry in the expansion pattern .",
    "if any , knots in the northern side of the nebula seem to have suffered a stronger deceleration throughout the remnant lifetime than those in the southern part .",
    "therefore , our calculations do not support the prediction of @xcite that knots in sw quarter should have been slowed down more than the rest .",
    "smaller proper motions in the nw quadrant are also mentioned in @xcite .",
    "in addition , our initial hypothesis of purely radial motions can be tested by comparing the direction of the velocity vectors in the plane of the sky , @xmath24 , with the position angle pa of knots in the plane of the sky , i.e. their radial direction from the central star .",
    "as in figure  [ f - agepa ] , only knots with @xmath5635  arcsec are considered in order to limit projection effects .",
    "figure  [ f - alphpa ] shows that velocity vectors are generally aligned along the radial direction but a clear symmetric pattern of non - radial velocities is also observed .",
    "the maximum deviations are observed in the ne quadrant , where knots trajectories seems systematically bended toward the east with respect to the radial direction , and the western part of the nebula , where knots velocity vectors are preferentially bended toward the south .",
    "the gk  per optical nebula suffered clear morphological and brightness changes in the last 50 years .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f-1953vs2011 ] , where a @xmath632 zoom of the 1953 image is compared to a smoothed version of our 2011 image .",
    "the main changes are a relative brightening of the whole eastern side of the nebula compared to the western side , and in particular the development of a more prominent `` bar '' in the ne edge ( see also @xcite ) , and a progressive circularization of the sw edge of the nebula , i.e. of the region of the strong interaction observed at radio and x - ray wavelengths . in general , the outflow looks more circular and uniform than in the past .    as most of our images were taken with the same instrument , detector , and filter , the brightness variation of the nebula in the last decade can be quantified .",
    "the 15 int+wfc flux - matched frames marked with an asterisk in table  [ t - imaobs ] were used . to measure the brightness of the nebula , all stars inside or nearby the remnant were masked .",
    "we first measured the brightness variation of the nebula as a whole . in figure",
    "[ f - totflux ] we present the evolution of the total flux of the remnant normalized to the value that it had in 1999 .",
    "it shows that the total @xmath2+[nii ] flux of the nebula has been linearly decreasing , for a total of 31%  over the 12.04 years considered , i.e. at a rate of 2.6%  per year , which is similar to what measured in the radio by @xcite and attributed to adiabatic expansion of the remnant into the surrounding medium .",
    "second , the flux variation for each of the four quadrants ( ne , nw , se , sw ) was computed . as can be seen from figure  [ f - secflux ]",
    ", the ne quadrant shows the shallowest decline , with even some possible re - brightening in the last 3 years .",
    "the quadrant fading at the largest rate is the sw one .",
    "third , we have also considered the flux variations for a number of individual knots .",
    "their fluxes were measured using circular apertures matched to the knots size , using an external annulus for background subtraction .",
    "the 1999 image could not be used for the measurement of individual knots because of its poorer seeing . after excluding knots in crowded areas",
    ", we could measure the flux variation of 85 knots .",
    "illustrative examples are presented in figure  [ f - bright ] . in the figure ,",
    "the flux is normalized to the maximum flux of each knot in the period considered . out of 85 knots , 50%",
    "show a similar fading as the nebula as a whole ( first two rows in the figure ) .",
    "some 15%  have a constant flux ( third row ) , while some 20%  of the knots show instead a monotonic brightening ( fourth row in figure  [ f - bright ] ) .",
    "finally , 15%  of the knots are rapidly fading or brightening ( or both ) during the 2004 - 2011 period ( last three rows ) .",
    "the most extreme cases show a sudden brightening of a factor of 5 in one year ( bottom - left panel ) , or a similarly fast brightening and then a dramatic fading on a timescale of less than three years ( bottom - right panel ) .",
    "the brightness variations of individual knots is also discussed by @xcite .",
    "our kinematical determination of a distance of 400@xmath330  pc for gk  per ( section  [ s - kinmod ] ) compares well with the value derived using the absolute peak luminosity of novae . we have considered four different relationships between @xmath64 at peak luminosity and the rate of the nova decline ( @xcite ) , depending on @xmath65 ( the time in days the nova takes to fade 2 mag from the peak brightness ) .",
    "assuming the following for gk  per : @xmath66 d , a peak visual magnitude of @xmath67=0.2 mag , and a reddening of @xmath68 ( @xcite ) , we have computed the distance to gk  per using the different relationships .",
    "the average distance is 440@xmath370  pc , in good agreement with our kinematic estimate",
    ".    our distance also broadly agrees with ( and should improve ) the estimates from other authors using the expansion parallax of the remnant .",
    "the most widely used distance is 470 pc by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the distance to be 525 pc .",
    "a more recent determination by @xcite states @xmath69 pc .",
    "finally , a rather short distance to gk  per , 337 pc , was determined in @xcite using the bailey s method ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method considers the @xmath70-band magnitude of the secondary star , which for cataclysmic variables is not easily separated from the disc contribution : therefore the calculated distance should be considered as a lower limit .",
    "the largest distance determination is the one by @xcite , 726 pc , using again the @xmath70 mag and their estimated spectral type for the secondary star ( k2 iv ) .",
    "our kinematical study , combining velocity measurements both in the plane of the sky and along the line of sights , has highlighted several basic properties of the dynamical evolution of the gk  per nova remnant .",
    "the outflow consists of a thick shell composed of about a thousand knots and filaments .",
    "knots velocities range from 250 to 1100  km  s@xmath1 , with the majority of them having a velocity between 600 and 1000  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the kinematical ages of knots from the proper motion measurements indicate that most of them have been only modestly slowed down in the 102.9 years from the ejection to the present , with no significant deceleration during the last 10 - 20 years .",
    "clear evidence for systematic deviations of the expansion rate with direction is either not found .    on the other hand ,",
    "some long - term evolution of the overall characteristics of the nebula is highlighted .",
    "the most notable changes are a progressive circularization of the sw nebular edge , and a relative brightening of the whole eastern side compared to the western part , with the development of a `` bar '' in the ne edge .    in few words",
    ", the nebula seems to expand nearly ballistically , and is progressively becoming rounder and more uniform in terms of surface brightness .",
    "these results are somewhat surprising considering the previous interpretation of the evolution of the gk  per remnant .",
    "in fact , the asymmetry observed at radio and x - ray wavelengths @xcite seems to indicate that along the sw direction strong interaction of the remnant with relatively dense circumstellar material has occurred .",
    "this is however not reflected in enhanced deceleration of the optical knots along this direction .",
    "the interpretation of the nebular dynamics should take into account these new results . a basic role in the discussion is played by the original circumbinary density distribution",
    "into which the nova ejecta expanded .",
    "its most visible expression is the large bipolar nebula first detected from iras data by @xcite .",
    "the strongest argument for the association between this bipolar structure and the nova is geometrical , that is , the emission is symmetrically placed around gk  per .",
    "the inherent problems of the classification of the bipolar nebulosity as an old planetary nebula from the primary star of the system were presented by @xcite .",
    "an alternative solution has been proposed by @xcite : in it the secondary star could be responsible for the formation of the extended nebula as it evolved off the main sequence triggering a major transfer of material into the primary star causing a born - again asymptotic giant branch event . as revealed by deep optical imaging",
    "the extended emission presents a typical bipolar morphology with the polar axis oriented in the nw - se direction .",
    "the nebula shows an asymmetry between the ne and sw edges that @xcite interpreted as the motion of the nebula to the sw assuming high relative velocity with respect to the ism . within this picture",
    "the non - thermal radio @xcite and the x - rays @xcite emission in the sw direction is interpreted by @xcite to be a consequence of the nova ejecta ploughing the denser medium of the sw side of the bipolar nebula .",
    "we can test this idea in the framework of the existing hydrodynamical models of nebular interaction with the ism .",
    "the central binary is moving with a space velocity of @xmath71 km  s@xmath1 @xcite , or 4.6@xmath72 pc  yr@xmath1 . for simplification ,",
    "we consider the central source as a single star ( as successfully done for mira , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , given that the direction of the movement is almost perpendicular to the axis of the bipolar lobes we can also assume spherical symmetry ( the formation of a bipolar structure is complex and beyond the scope of the present work ) . with this simplifications at hand we can consider that the interaction process can be similar , at least regarding the discussion that follows , to that of the wind of an agb star with the ism ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , a simulation with a relative speed of @xmath73  km  s@xmath1  can be found in @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that once a bow - shock structure is formed , the subsequent stellar wind expands unperturbed inside the asymmetric outer cavity created by the interaction . in these conditions , never the stellar material ejected inside this cavity can feel the outer interaction if it is inside the bow - shock structure . the same idea",
    "could be applied to gk  per : if both the outer bipolar nebula and the nova ejecta are the result of the evolution of the central binary , and the nova shell is expanding inside the bipolar nebula , then the ejecta can not see the interaction with the ism , and should expand unperturbed .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the lack of evidence for deviations of the expansion rate with direction found in this work .",
    "in particular , the sw side , where most of the interaction with the circumstellar medium was assumed to occurred in the past ( see radio and x - ray data ) does not show any sign of larger deceleration than the rest of the nebula .",
    "the asymmetry observed in the radio and x - rays , however , would remain unexplained in this scenario .",
    "an alternative possibility is the existence of a mechanism that allows interaction with the ism to permeate from the outer structure to the nova shell .",
    "an interaction with magnetized ism could provide this mechanism @xcite .",
    "in fact , the nature of the radio and x - ray emission could be explained as dense gas clouds moving supersonically through a magnetized low - density medium .",
    "@xcite show how the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons increases rapidly when the cloud begins to fragment under a rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "they also show how the interaction of this wind with dense condensations can lead to strong magnetic fields .",
    "if relativistic particles are formed as the fast wind is shocked , then the enhanced magnetic field will result in non - thermal radio emission .",
    "at this point we can turn our attention back to the outburst mechanism that leads to the formation of the nova ejecta .",
    "its thick shell geometry can be the result of an ejection with a range of initial velocities , or the dynamical evolution of the interaction of different components .",
    "we favour the latter hypothesis , which is supported by the observations of nova shells soon after outburst .",
    "it has been argued in the literature that two distinct outflow components of different origin are present at early times : an earlier , slow one from the circumbinary gas , and a later , fast one result of the outburst ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of nova cyg 1992 ,",
    "@xcite show that the main shell ejected at the moment of the outburst contains the bulk of the ejected matter and is located in the outermost region of the ejecta region , while a less massive impulsive event forms a faster expanding shell that eventually will catch up with the main shell generating a region of shock interaction where the two shells meet . eventually , the process gives rise to the formation of a new shell formed by the merger of the two .",
    "a similar scenario in terms of discrete shell ejection events is proposed by @xcite and @xcite to explain the absorption line spectra of the early ejecta of 15 nova shells .    in gk  per",
    "we are probably witnessing the late evolution of such of a process , and in this respect it is natural that any asymmetry originally present in the dense ejecta ( see e.g. the 1917 images in @xcite ) disappears with time as the combined shell expands outward .",
    "this explains the progressive circularization and homogenization of the optical outflow .",
    "the original asymmetry can also be understood in terms of the binary interactions in the system ( e.g. @xcite ) .    based on observations made with the isaac newton telescope , operated by the isaac newton group , and with the nordic optical telescope , operated jointly by denmark , finland , iceland , norway , and sweden , on the island of la palma in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
