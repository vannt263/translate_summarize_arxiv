    "particle statistics of a collection of indistinguishable particles is a genuinely quantum mechanical concept without any classical analog . in spatial dimensions three and above ,",
    "pairwise interchange of particle coordinates in a many - body system is equivalent to a simple permutation of the coordinates .",
    "consequently , each interchange has the effect of either a change of sign ( fermion ) or no change at all ( boson ) on the many - body quantum wave function . in @xmath1 dimensions",
    ", however , exchanges and permutations are not necessarily equivalent .",
    "@xcite in this case , under simple interchange of the particle coordinates , the corresponding space - time trajectories can form non - trivial braids in the @xmath1-dimensional space - time .",
    "@xcite consequently , in ( @xmath2 ) dimensions , particles can have quantum statistics strikingly different from the statistics of bosons and fermions .    a straightforward extension of the statistics of bosons and fermions is the abelian anyonic statistics , in which the many body wave - function , under pairwise exchange of the particle coordinates , picks up a phase @xmath3 , which can take any value between @xmath4 ( bosons ) and @xmath5 ( fermions ) . since a phase factor is only a one - dimensional representation of the braid group in @xmath6 , the statistics is still abelian . on the other hand ,",
    "if the many body ground state wave function happens to be a linear combination of states from a degenerate subspace , a pairwise exchange of the particles can unitarily _ rotate _ the wave function in the ground state subspace . in this case , the effect of exchanging the particle positions is an operation on the wave function vector by a unitary matrix representing this rotation .",
    "consequently , the statistics is non - abelian ,  @xcite and the corresponding system is a non - abelian quantum system .",
    "it has been proposed that such systems , if the ground state subspace is concurrently protected by an energy gap , can be used as a fault - tolerant platform for topological quantum computation ( tqc ) .",
    "@xcite    one important class of non - abelian quantum systems , sometimes referred to as the ising topological class , @xcite is characterized by quasiparticle excitations called majorana fermions , which involve no energy cost ( when the mutual separation among the excitations is large ) .",
    "the second quantized operators , @xmath7 , corresponding to these zero energy excitations are self - hermitian , @xmath8 , which is in striking contrast to ordinary fermionic ( or bosonic ) operators for which @xmath9 .",
    "however , since @xmath7 and @xmath10 anticommute when @xmath11 , they retain some properties of ordinary fermion operators as well .",
    "the majorana fermions , which are actually more like half - fermions , were envisioned @xcite by e. majorana in 1935 as fundamental constituents of nature ( _ e.g. _ neutrinos are thought to be majorana , rather than dirac , fermions ) .",
    "majorana modes are intriguing @xcite because each majorana particle is its own anti - particle unlike dirac fermions where electrons and positrons ( or holes ) are distinct .",
    "although the emergence of majorana excitations , which are effectively fractionalized objects ( anyons ) obeying non - abelian anyonic statistics , in solid state systems is by itself an extraordinary phenomenon , a great deal of attention has also been focused on them because of the possibility of carrying out fault tolerant tqc in two dimensional systems using these majorana particles .",
    "tqc , in contrast to ordinary quantum computation , would not require any quantum error correction since the majorana excitations are immune to local noise by virtue of their non - local topological nature .",
    "@xcite the direct experimental observation of majorana modes in solid state systems would therefore be a remarkable breakthrough both from the perspective of fundamental physics of fractional statistics in nature and the technological perspective of building a working quantum computer .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that there has been recent resurgence of immense interest for the experimental realization ( and detection ) of majorana fermions in solid state systems .",
    "recently , some exotic ordered states in condensed matter systems , such as the pfaffian states in fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems ,  @xcite @xmath12-wave superconductors / superfluids ,  @xcite theoretical models that can be potentially simulated in cold atom optical lattice systems , @xcite as well as the surface state of a topological insulator ( ti ) or related systems  @xcite have been discussed as systems which can support majorana fermions as the lowest energy excitations . in the context of optical lattice systems , it has also been proposed that a 2d @xmath13 superfluid can be realized using only @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance modified by the topological berry phases arising from artificially generated spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite    it has been shown recently  @xcite that even a regular semiconducting film with a sizable rashba - type spin - orbit coupling , such as ingaas thin films , can host , under suitable conditions , majorana fermions as low energy excitations . since the basic effects behind the emergence of the majorana fermion excitations ",
    "spin - orbit coupling , @xmath0-wave superconductivity , and zeeman splitting  are physically well - understood and experimentally known to occur in many solid state materials , the proposed semiconductor heterostructure  @xcite is possibly one of the simplest condensed matter systems supporting majorana quasiparticles and non - abelian quantum order . by an analysis of the real - space bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations for a vortex in the semiconductor thin film , in which @xmath0-wave superconductivity and a zeeman splitting are proximity - induced ( fig .",
    "( 1a ) ) , it has been shown that the lowest energy quasiparticle excitation in the vortex core is a zero - energy majorana fermion mode .",
    "this real space analysis has also been supported by a momentum space analysis in the form of an index theorem @xcite analogous to such a treatment in the context of one - dimensional dirac theory .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "a comment about the various means to induce a zeeman splitting in the semiconductor thin film is in order .",
    "note that when the spin - orbit coupling is of the rashba type , we require a zeeman splitting which is perpendicular to the plane of the film ( zeeman splitting parallel to the film does not produce a gap in the one - electron band - structure , a firm requirement of our non - abelian state ) . @xcite inducing such a splitting by applying a strong perpendicular magnetic field is not convenient , because the magnetic field will give rise to unwanted order parameter defects such as vortices .",
    "it is for this reason that we propose to induce the zeeman splitting by the exchange proximity effect of an adjacent magnetic insulator ( we ignore the small coupling of the spins in the semiconductor with the actual magnetic field of the magnetic insulator ) .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that , when the spin - orbit coupling also has a component which is of the dresselhaus type , the appropriate zeeman splitting can also be induced by applying an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "@xcite the majorana mode is separated by a finite energy gap ( so - called mini - gap ) from the other conventional fermionic excited states in the vortex core .",
    "thus , for a collection of well - separated vortices , the resulting degenerate ground state subspace is protected from the environment by the mini - gap .",
    "this enables the potential use of the semiconductor heterostructure in fig .",

    "this obviates the need for a nearby magnetic insulator .",
    "for the zeeman splitting above a critical value , the wire is in a non - abelian topological phase with zero - energy majorana excitations at the ends .",

    "we find that , contrary to a previous treatment of the same problem ,  @xcite the decay length of the zero - energy majorana mode localized in the spin - orbit vortex is inversely proportional to the superconducting gap .",
    "therefore , in the limit of vanishing superconducting gap , the majorana mode will delocalize over the entire system .",
    "we then show in sec .",

    "[ vi ] , we confirm our approximate analytical calculations , which are indicative of the existence of the zero - energy modes in the vortices in the spin - orbit coupled semiconductor , by a full numerical solution of the bdg equations set up on a sphere .",
    "@xcite here we obtain the full bound - state excitation spectrum for the bdg hamiltonian relevant for a vortex - antivortex pair placed at the poles of a sphere .",
    "@xcite in the non - abelian phase of the semiconductor film , this calculation produces a pair of lowest energy states whose energy eigenvalues approach zero exponentially with the radius of the sphere .",
    "this indicates the presence of one exact zero - energy state on each vortex in the limit of infinite inter - vortex separation .",
    "the numerical calculations also show that the excitation gap above the zero energy state , the mini - gap , can be made comparable to the induced @xmath0-wave gap @xmath241 in the semiconductor film .",
    "this surprising result , which was obtained previously for the proximity - induced superconducting state on the surface of a ti ,  @xcite is now extended to the spin - orbit coupled semiconductor in this paper .",

    "apart from the zero - energy majorana states in order parameter defects such as vortices , the non - abelian topological state in the semiconductor film is also characterized by gapless majorana modes at the sample edges . in sec .",

    "[ xi ] we demonstrate the existence of zero - energy majorana modes at the ends of a one dimensional version of the spin - orbit coupled semiconductor system  a semiconducting nanowire .",
    "it has been shown that it may be far simpler to experimentally realize majorana fermions in the one dimensional nanowire system because the zeeman splitting can be induced by a modest in - plane magnetic field , obviating the need for a proximate magnetic insulator .",
    "@xcite we find that the majorana modes at the two ends of the nanowire can be probed by scanning tunneling microscope experiments .",
    "we show by explicit calculations that the majorana modes at the ends of the nanowire give rise to zero - bias conductance peaks in the tunneling spectrum at the ends .",
    "these peaks disappear on lowering the zeeman coupling so that the system settles into the non - topological superconducting state .",
    "furthermore these zero - bias conductance peaks are found to be the only features at bias voltages below the induced superconducting gap in the nanowire .",
    "we believe that the observation of this zero - bias tunneling peak in the semiconductor nanowire is the simplest experiment proposed so far to unambiguously detect a majorana fermion state in a condensed matter system .",
    "we note here that the majorana fermions , being non - abelian particles belonging to the @xmath542 conformal field theory ( i.e. the so - called `` ising anyon '' universality class ) , can not directly be used for universal fault - tolerant topological quantum computation ( tqc ) .",
    "@xcite they can serve as topologically protected quantum memory or can be used in quantum computation along with supplementary unprotected quantum gates requiring only small amounts of error corrections . @xcite since the topological protection for the semiconductor heterostructures in our work is very robust , with the energy gap providing the protection being of the order of the superconducting gap (  1 - 10k ) itself , our proposed system could serve as an excellent quantum memory in tqc applications . in a recent development , bonderson et al . have shown @xcite that certain dynamic - topology - changing operations , which are feasible in our proposed semiconductor heterostructures , dubbed ising sandwich heterostructures ( ish)in ref .",
    "@xcite , could allow fully fault - tolerant tqc to be carried out using our proosed systems .",
    "thus , in addition to the fundamental significance of the possible non - abelian quantum order and the existence of topological majorana excitations , these semiconductor - superconductor structures may have future application as the basic components of a topological quantum computer .",
    "our proposed non - abelian system is possibly one of the simplest to study experimentally since it involves neither special materials nor exceptional purity nor the application of a high magnetic field .",
    "it is encouraging to note that proximity - induced @xmath0-wave superconductivity has already been realized in a host inas semiconductor film,@xcite which additionally has a sizable spin - orbit coupling .",
    "experimentally , the only new effect that must be introduced to the system is a strong enough zeeman splitting of the spins .",
    "we argue how this can be achieved also via the proximity effect due to a nearby magnetic insulator .",
    "it is important to emphasize that when the spin - orbit coupling is of the rashba type , we require a zeeman splitting which is perpendicular to the plane of the film .",
    "this is because a zeeman splitting parallel to the film does not produce a gap in the one - electron band - structure .",
    "@xcite inducing a perpendicular splitting by applying a strong perpendicular magnetic field is not convenient , because the magnetic field will give rise to unwanted order parameter defects such as vortices .",
    "it is for this reason that we propose to induce the zeeman splitting by the exchange proximity effect of an adjacent magnetic insulator ( we ignore the small coupling of the spins in the semiconductor with the actual magnetic field of the magnetic insulator ) .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that , when the spin - orbit coupling also has a component which is of the dresselhaus type , the appropriate zeeman splitting can also be induced by applying an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "@xcite note that an in - plane magnetic field does not produce unwanted vortex excitations .",
    "the one dimensional version of our system  a semiconducting nanowire  is also a non - abelian system in the presence of proximity induced _",
    "s_-wave superconductivity and a zeeman coupling .",
    "it is quite exciting that the superconducting proximity effect on an inas nanowire has already been realized in experiments.@xcite in this case , the zeeman coupling can be more easily introduced by applying an external magnetic field parallel to the length of the wire because such a field does produce a gap in the one - electron band structure without producing unwanted excitations in the adjacent superconductor .",
    "this obviates the need for a nearby magnetic insulator .",
    "@xcite in the topological superconducting state of the nanowire ( _ i.e. , _ the zeeman coupling is above a critical value ) , there are zero - energy majorana states localized around the two ends .",
    "such zero energy states can be revealed by zero - bias conductance peaks in stm tunneling experiments at the ends of the wire .",
    "all other contributions to the conductance occur at energies higher than the bulk gap @xmath241 .",
    "there will be no such zero - bias peak when the wire is in the topologically trivial _",
    "s_-wave superconducting state ( _ i.e. , _ the zeeman coupling is below the critical value ) .",
    "such an stm experiment from the semiconducting nanowire will serve as an unambiguous probe for the condensed matter manifestation of a majorana fermion mode .",

    "even though we found an analytic solution for the null vectors of the matrix for @xmath95 in the region @xmath96 , we could not find such a solution for @xmath543 for @xmath123 . in a previous section we claimed without explicit proof that the solution to this equation can be written in terms of a power - series expansion for @xmath544 .",
    "since we are interested in the solution at large @xmath99 we expect a power - series in @xmath545 to converge . to generate the equation for the power - series for @xmath546 it is convenient to shift to a basis where the @xmath129 part of the matrix is diagonal .",
