    "it is now accepted that the so - called long - soft ( @xmath32 s ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) accompany some core - collapse supernovae of type ic @xcite .",
    "the collective evidence also lends credence to the collapsar model for grbs , in which a relativistic jet breaks through and explodes a hydrogen - stripped wolf - rayet star @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", our understanding of these energetic explosions is still limited by the paucity of nearby ( @xmath4 ) grbs with high - quality photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "on ut 2006 february 18.149 , the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) detected an unusually long duration high - energy event @xcite .",
    "its prompt gamma - ray light curve was soft , confined to the 1550 kev band for the first 290  s @xcite ; this was followed by a spectrally harder ( 25100 kev ) 10-s `` spike '' that concluded with an exponential coda extending beyond @xmath5  s @xcite .",
    "the relatively odd behavior of this high - energy transient generated uncertainty as to its basic nature ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and poor observing conditions at ground - based observatories prevented a quick resolution .",
    "however , the identification of an extended optical object at the precise position of the x - ray and optical transient ( ot ) in pre - burst observations of this field @xcite favored an extra - galactic location .",
    "ultimately , optical spectroscopic observations of the ot discovered by the _ swift _ uv / optical telescope @xcite confirmed the low - redshift @xmath6 , extragalactic nature of this unusual grb @xcite , making it the second lowest burst redshift known to date after grb 980425/sn  1998bw at @xmath7 .    in this letter",
    "we describe the identification of the grb 060218 host galaxy and its redshift , together with photometry and spectroscopy that verify its origin in the explosion of a massive star , and discuss the implications of our results .",
    "we assume an @xmath871 km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 cosmological model , corresponding to a luminosity distance @xmath12  mpc at @xmath13 and an angular scale 0.658 kpc  arcsec@xmath9 .",
    "optical observations of grb 060218 began at the mdm observatory on feb .",
    "19.146 ut using the 2.4 m telescope and retrocam , the retractable optical camera for monitoring , equipped with sdss filters @xcite , and continued on february 20 .",
    "additional @xmath2 photometric observations were carried out on the mdm 1.3 m and 2.4 m telescopes using a site @xmath14 thinned , back side - illuminated ccd on several nights from february 21 to march 16 .",
    "all of the photometry was converted to a common @xmath2 system using @xcite standard stars , and corrected for galactic extinction assuming @xmath15 from the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "we note that this value is consistent with the extinction estimated from high - resolution spectra by @xcite using the combined na  i  d absorption - line equivalent widths from the galaxy and grb host .",
    "this uniform data set , listed in table  [ table1 ] and shown in fig .",
    "[ light_curve ] , can be fitted with a power - law decay plus a supernova ( sn ) light curve that will be described in more detail in the following section .",
    "data for grb 060218 , corrected for galactic extinction and host - galaxy contamination .",
    "the _ solid line _ is a fit to the @xmath16-band light curve .",
    "the _ dotted line _ is a fit to the @xmath16-band light curve after subtracting an @xmath17 power - law decay ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) as justified in the text .",
    "the _ dashed line _ is a template of the @xmath16-band light curve of sn  1998bw @xcite shifted to @xmath18 .",
    "[ _ see the electronic edition of the journal for a color version of this figure . _ ] ]    the position of the ot in an mdm 2.4 m image was measured with respect to the apparent host galaxy sdss j032139.68 + 165201.7 using a set of unsaturated stars common to both images .",
    "we find that the ot is centered on the compact galaxy to less than @xmath19 ( 130  pc ) in each coordinate .",
    "this is to be compared with the galaxy s half - light radius , @xmath20 ( 1.0  kpc ) .",
    "spectra of grb 060218 were obtained starting on february 20.097 ut with the boller & chivens ccd spectrograph ( ccds ) mounted on the 2.4 m telescope .",
    "the setup used provides 3.1    pixel@xmath9 dispersion and @xmath21  resolution with a @xmath22 slit .",
    "the observations consisted of two 1800  s integrations under fair sky conditions .",
    "the spectra were processed using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "the wavelength scale was established by fitting a set of polynomials to xe lamp spectra obtained immediately after each target exposure .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star feige  34 @xcite , observed at comparable telescope pointing to the grb , was used for flux calibration .",
    "although no order - separating filter was used , we expect that second - order contamination is less than 1.5% below 7000   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another set of spectra , consisting of three 720  s integrations , was obtained on march 17.12 ut using the modular spectrograph ( modspec ) on the 2.4 m telescope , which provides 2    pixel@xmath9 dispersion and @xmath23    resolution with a @xmath24 slit .",
    "similar reduction steps , plus correction for atmospheric absorption bands , were performed .",
    "figure  [ spectrum ] shows the dereddened @xcite , wavelength- and flux - calibrated spectra of grb 060218/sn  2006aj .",
    "( see text ) .",
    "photometry before and after the spectrum was taken ( table  [ table1 ] ) is consistent with this spectral index . ]",
    "strong , redshifted nebular emission lines identified in the spectrum are listed in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the fluxes are taken from the ccds spectrum , while the more accurate wavelengths from the modspec are listed . the weighted mean heliocentric redshift derived from the emission lines is @xmath25 , and the line widths are unresolved at the resolution of @xmath26 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "the emission - line redshift is consistent with the na  i  d absorption - line velocities from the host @xcite , falling within the 20  km  s@xmath9 spread of the latter .",
    "the balmer decrement indicates little or no intrinsic reddening .",
    "in addition , the earlier spectrum reveals a relatively blue continuum that is reasonably well fitted by a power - law of the form @xmath27 with spectral index @xmath28 and by a broad p  cygni feature with the bottom of the absorption trough at @xmath29   rest wavelength .",
    "we argue that this spectral feature corresponds to @xmath30 with an expansion velocity 31500 @xmath319200 km  s@xmath9 .",
    "an identification with na  i  d moving at about 8700 km s@xmath9 , or with he  i @xmath32 at even lower velocity , appears less likely when compared to the early - time optical spectra of type ic sne @xcite .",
    "this detection signals the emergence of the supernova designated sn 2006aj @xcite , and seals the connection between grb 060218 and the explosion of a massive star .",
    "the weak line , as well as a nearly featureless continuum at early times , are typical of type ic sn explosions lacking both a hydrogen and helium envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "sn  2006aj appears to be much bluer than the type ic sn  1998bw .",
    "the early spectral shape of sn  2006aj resembles more closely the type ic grb 030329/sn  2003dh spectra obtained within a week of that burst @xcite .",
    "the emergence of a weak , broad si ii feature so soon after the _ swift _ bat localization implies that sn  2006aj began @xmath33 days after the grb 060218 .",
    "this basic picture is confirmed by the flattening and rise in the optical light curve on 2006 february 21.181 ut ( fig .  [ light_curve ] ) . to better constrain the sn contribution to the light curve",
    ", we subtracted the host galaxy contribution and , optionally , a power - law decay assumed to be from relativistic ejecta interacting with the circumburst medium .",
    "the host galaxy magnitudes were transformed from @xcite , @xcite , and our own landolt star calibrations .",
    "there is direct evidence that emission generated by the relativistic ejecta began on the first day after the trigger , when a temporal power - law index @xmath34 describes the x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "such decay is slightly steeper than a power - law index @xmath35 that can be fitted to our @xmath36-band measurements prior to february 21 , but these are consistent because the optical band is already affected by the sn rise at this point .",
    "taking @xmath34 as an estimate for the early optical decay rate ( _ the dot - dashed line _ in fig .",
    "[ light_curve ] ) , and subtracting it and the contribution of the host galaxy will produce the residual @xmath16-band sn light curve shown as the _ dotted line _ in figure 1 . allowing for uncertainties in the initial optical decay rate , which could be slower than in the x - ray , the sn rise is consistent with an origin at the grb trigger time . alternatively ,",
    "if we ignore the @xmath36-band measurements obtained on february 1920 , and assume that the light curve is completely dominated by the sn  2006aj rise after february 21 , we get a much flatter sn light curve ( the solid line in fig .  [ light_curve ] ) .",
    "the latter model is less attractive , as it neglects the first 2 days of bright , decaying optical emission and points to a supernova time several days before the grb .    for comparison",
    "we show a fit of the @xmath16-band light curve of sn  1998bw @xcite shifted to @xmath13 .",
    "both the raw and modeled @xmath16-band light curves suggest that sn  2006aj reached maximum in @xmath16 on 2006 february 28.3 ut ( @xmath37 days after the burst ) .",
    "the peak of sn  2006aj occurs earlier than in sn  1998bw , and is more like the type ic sn  2002ap @xcite .",
    "the peak absolute magnitude of sn  2006aj is @xmath38 .",
    "although it was much bluer than sn  1998bw early on , sn  2006aj s maximum is 0.53  mag fainter than sn  1998bw , which probably translates into @xmath39 of ejected @xmath40ni mass during the explosion @xcite .    at a redshift of @xmath13",
    "the @xmath41-ray fluence of grb 060218 corresponds to isotropic energy @xmath42 = @xmath43 ergs , and the peak luminosity is @xmath44 ergs  s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this energy release is at least an order of magnitude lower than the average energy measured in long - duration grbs and yet a factor of @xmath45 larger than the intrinsically weak grb 980425/sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "this energy is in fact comparable to the soft x - ray flash xrf 020903 @xcite . in terms of the x - ray emission ,",
    "the isotropic x - ray luminosity of grb 060218 at @xmath46 hr is @xmath47 ergs  s@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath48 fainter than the sample of grb x - ray luminosities culled by @xcite .",
    "however , this strict comparison may not be meaningful , since it does not take into account the contribution from an earlier flaring period .",
    "in fact , a rough estimate of the x - ray fluence of grb 060218 for the first orbit of _ swift _ data ( 1592770 s post - trigger ) yields @xmath49 ergs , a large fraction of the total .",
    "next , we examine the host galaxy of grb  060218 in greater detail .",
    "the observed line ratios are typical of a high - excitation starburst galaxy .",
    "in particular , the measured h@xmath50 line flux , uncorrected for extinction at the host galaxy , implies a star - formation rate ( sfr ) equivalent to @xmath51 0.050.15 @xmath52 yr@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "a similar computation of the sfr using [ ] yields @xmath53 @xmath52 yr@xmath9 .",
    "we also find a good agreement with the sfr derived using an extrapolation of the uv continuum luminosity of the host galaxy as tabulated in @xcite .    turning our attention to host galaxy metallicity",
    ", we can determine relative abundances from emission - line strengths of [ ] , h@xmath54 , and [ ] ( table  [ table2 ] ) by adopting the calibrations in @xcite . under this approximation ,",
    "the metallicity is [ o / h ] = @xmath55 , assuming log(o / h)@xmath56 + 12 = 8.72 @xcite .",
    "this value is slightly larger than the measurement for the xrf 031203 host @xcite , but it is still among the lowest observed for grb hosts .",
    "we also estimate @xmath57 for sdss j032139.68 + 165201.7 , which ranks this galaxy in the bright end of local group dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "together , its energetics and host - galaxy metallicity place grb 060218 somewhere between grb 980425/sn  1998bw @xcite and xrf 031203 @xcite .",
    "most importantly , this event continues to shape a picture in which sub - luminous , sub - energetic grb - supernovae born in low - metallicity , dwarf galaxies dominate the local ( @xmath58 ) population of grb events ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it remains to be seen whether this empirical result constitutes a selection effect ( i.e. , we are simply missing the analogues of faint explosions at higher redshifts ) or whether the trend is indeed a real consequence of stellar and/or metallicity evolution over the ages @xcite .",
    "if the latter is correct , low - metallicity progenitors in the local universe may differ from grb progenitors at higher redshifts .",
    "it is notable that during the early , x - ray bright phase the absorbing column density needed to fit the _ swift _ x - ray spectrum , @xmath59  @xmath60 @xcite , is considerably greater than both the galactic and host extinction derived from optical emission and absorption lines , as well as from the optical colors of the afterglow .",
    "the standard galactic ratio @xmath61(+h@xmath62)/@xmath63 @xmath60  mag@xmath9 @xcite would predict @xmath64 , rather than the @xmath65 observed from the optical methods . since `` x - ray @xmath66 '' is not",
    "really @xmath66 , but a proxy for the heavier elements that dominate x - ray photoelectric absorption , this implies a dust - deficient medium .",
    "the stellar wind of a wolf - rayet progenitor has enough column density to be the location of this excess photoelectric x - ray absorption .",
    "phenomenologically , grb 060218 does share some properties with the `` classical '' high - redshift burst population , showing the canonical imprint of emission from a relativistic blast wave or jet running into circumstellar material ( @xmath34 ) prior to the sn emergence .",
    "it also reveals extended prompt x - ray emission remarkably similar to the early x - ray light curves inferred from _ swift _",
    "x - ray telescope observations @xcite . based solely on the early results from grb 060218 , and using our sparse optical data before the sn rise",
    ", we can not firmly distinguish among a relativistic jet afterglow , emission from a jet cocoon @xcite , or decaying blackbody radiation associated with `` shock breakout '' @xcite .",
    "as calculated in spherical sn models , shock breakout refers to the first observable event after core collapse , and it will occur at @xmath67hr @xcite .",
    "but in the likely case of a highly asymmetric explosion accompanying a grb , a narrow `` jet breakout '' can be observed , as well as a jet - driven shock emerging with different delays from around the stellar envelope .",
    "we reported the identification of grb 060218 as the second nearest grb known to date . taken together , the emerging sn light curve , the development of a si ii feature , and the lack of hydrogen lines in the spectrum indicate that the progenitor of this event was a massive star , most likely in the wolf - rayet family , that was stripped of its hydrogen and helium envelope prior to the explosion .",
    "the presence of early ( @xmath68 2 days after the burst ) residual light in the decay suggests that a fraction of the early emission was created by a mildly relativistic blast wave or jet running into circumstellar material .",
    "furthermore , the extrapolation of a derived sn  2006aj light curve back in time supports the idea that the grb was nearly simultaneous with the massive core collapse that gave rise to the sn . finally , the sub - energetic nature of this nearby event and its location within a low - metallicity host galaxy highlight the possibility that the variety in massive stellar explosions is , in part , intrinsic to the metallicity of their progenitors .",
