    "we note that @xmath331 is a manifold of critical points for system when @xmath323 , that is @xmath332 system is known as the _ layer problem_.    using systems and it is straightforward to prove that the solution @xmath333 @xmath334 of system such that @xmath335 and @xmath336 @xmath337 can be estimated , for @xmath288 small enough , as @xmath338 so the stable manifold @xmath291 intersects the plane @xmath339 at the point @xmath340    for @xmath341 we compute @xmath342 since @xmath343 for all the points of @xmath331 , it follows that the manifold @xmath331 is a normally hyperbolic attracting manifold for @xmath344 .",
    "so in any compact set of @xmath331 we can apply the well known _ first fenichel theorem _",
    "( see , for instance , @xcite ) , which ensures the existence of a normally hyperbolic attracting invariant manifold @xmath345 for @xmath288 sufficiently small of system and , which is known as _ slow manifold_. the slow manifold @xmath345 is @xmath290close to @xmath331 , that is @xmath346 , where @xmath347 is defined in .",

    "thus we conclude that @xmath351 for @xmath288 sufficiently small . from similar reasons",
    "the slow manifold also contains the unstable manifold @xmath352 of the singularity @xmath321 for @xmath288 sufficiently small .",
    "we can easily check that the slow manifold @xmath345 intersects the plane @xmath339 transversely along the curve @xmath353 , where @xmath354    now we consider the solution @xmath355 of system starting at a point of the slow manifold @xmath345 . from its invariance property",
