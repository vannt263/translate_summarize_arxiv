    "tangled filamentary structures occur in many physical systems , from ropes to optics @xcite to dna @xcite .",
    "concentrated field lines in fluids @xcite and plasmas @xcite ( e.g. vortex lines and magnetic field lines ) are another important example .",
    "such lines undergo reconnection events , which are associated with energy losses . in the limit of no dissipation ,",
    "the governing equations of motion ( the euler equation and the magnetic induction equation in the frozen field approximation respectively ) preserve the topology of the lines . in this limit",
    ", helicity and magnetic helicity are conserved quantities .",
    "recent work suggests that , in the case of small dissipation , helicity is partially preserved @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to explore this partial preservation of helicity in a context where vortex lines are not mathematical abstractions but have a real physical meaning : this is the context of quantum fluids , notably superfluid liquid helium ( @xmath0he and @xmath1he ) and atomic bose - einstein condensates .",
    "the numerical experiment which we describe explores the relation between geometry , dynamics and topology of a small region of turbulence in superfluid helium .",
    "quantum fluids are characterised by zero viscosity and the quantisation of the circulation .",
    "the first property makes superfluids similar to inviscid euler fluids of traditional textbooks .",
    "the second property arises from the existence of a complex macroscopic wavefunction @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the position , @xmath4 is the time , @xmath5 is the number density ; according to the madelung transformation @xcite , the superfluid velocity is proportional to the gradient of the phase : @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the mass of the relevant boson ( @xmath8 for @xmath0he ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is planck s constant .",
    "the single - valuedness of @xmath11 implies that the circulation of the superfluid velocity field around a closed path @xmath12 is either zero or a multiple of the quantum of circulation @xmath13 :    @xmath14    ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "nonzero circulation occurs when the path @xmath12 encloses a vortex line ; in this case @xmath16 on the axis of the vortex line .",
    "since multi - charged    ( @xmath17 ) vortices are unstable , we are concerned only with the case @xmath18 . around the axis of the vortex line",
    "there is a thin tubular region of depleted density of radius @xmath19 in @xmath0he ; in this region , the density @xmath5 drops from its bulk value at infinity to zero on the vortex axis . in summary ,",
    "a vortex line is a hole with superfluid circulation around it . as in classical fluid dynamics ,",
    "quantum vortex lines are either closed loops or terminate at boundaries .",
    "an isolated vortex is a stable topological defect which does not decay , unlike vortices in ordinary viscous fluids .",
    "numerical simulations of the governing gross - pitaevskii equation for @xmath11 show that vortex lines reconnect when they come close to each other @xcite , as observed in experiments in superfluid helium @xcite and , more recently , in atomic condensates @xcite . in this process ,",
    "some of the kinetic energy of the vortices is turned into density waves @xcite .",
    "evidently , vortex reconnections are particular important for the dynamics of turbulence in superfluid helium @xcite and in atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    in typical experiments the average distance between vortices , @xmath20 to @xmath21",
    ", is many orders of magnitude larger than the vortex core radius @xmath22 .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to model quantum vortices as ( closed ) space curves @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is arc - length ) of infinitesimal thickness . in a pure superfluid ( e.g. liquid helium at temperatures below @xmath25 ) thermal excitations are negligible , and the vortex moves according to @xcite    @xmath26    where the self - induced velocity @xmath27 is given by the classical biot - savart law :    @xmath28    ( the line integral extending over the entire vortex configuration @xmath29 )",
    ". numerical simulations of quantum vortex lines are based on lagrangian discretisation of the lines @xcite .",
    "the number of discretisation points along a line varies , as more / less points are required in regions of high / low curvature .",
    "the biot - savart integral is de - singularised in a standard way @xcite ( based on the distance @xmath22 ) , and an algorithmic reconnection procedure is implemented @xcite .",
    "the numerical method is standard and has been published in the literature @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with ( experimentally easily accessible ) high temperatures ( @xmath30 ) . in this regime ,",
    "the thermal excitations form a viscous fluid ( called the normal fluid ) of velocity field @xmath31 which exchanges energy with the vortex line via a mutual friction force @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : helmoltz ] ) requires modifications , and becomes @xcite    @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{eq : schwarz}\\ ] ]    here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are small temperature - dependent friction coefficients arising from the interaction of the vortex lines with the thermal excitations which make up the normal fluid ( if @xmath35 then @xmath36 and @xmath37 , recovering eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmoltz ] ) ) .",
    "it must be stressed that the friction force is a two - way route to exchange energy between the normal fluid and the superfluid vortex lines .",
    "if a section of a vortex line is exposed to normal flow @xmath31 locally aligned in the same direction of the superfluid vorticity and with intensity larger than a certain critical value , infinitesimal perturbations on that section of the vortex line will grow in length in the form of kelvin waves ( helical displacements of the vortex axis away from its initial position ) ; this effect is called the glaberson - donnelly instability @xcite .",
    "vice - versa , if @xmath31 is perpendicular to the vortex line or if @xmath38 , the friction will dissipate the kelvin waves .",
    "similarly , if @xmath31 blows along the direction of propagation of a superfluid vortex ring , the ring will increase its radius ; vice - versa , if @xmath31 blows in the opposite direction or if @xmath38 , the ring will shrink and vanish .",
    "our aim is to numerically simulate a state of turbulence of vortex lines which has two properties : ( i ) it is in a statistical steady - state ( independent of the arbitrary initial condition , unlike previous work @xcite which was concerned with comparing energy and complexity during an initial transient ) , and ( ii ) is away from ( hard or periodic ) boundaries ( so that vortex lines are closed loops and the definition of linking is simple and unambiguous ) .",
    "it is not trivial to satisfy ( i ) and ( ii ) at the same time .",
    "most experiments and numerical simulations of quantum turbulence have been performed within hard or periodic boundaries . in these studies , after an initial transient , a steady - state regime is achieved and the vortex lines fill the entire domain , which means that some vortex lines are not closed loops but terminate at the boundaries . because of the lagrangian discretisation , calculations can also be performed in open , infinite domains , but in this case the vortex length will grow without limit .    the calculations which we present here model experiments @xcite in which ultra - sound waves were focused at the centre of the experimental cell creating vortex lines away from boundaries . in this experiments , vortex lines which left the central region decayed due to friction with the normal fluid which was stationary far from the central region . to model this experimental configuration",
    "we impose a time - dependent , space dependent velocity field @xmath31 in the form of random waves @xcite near the centre of the computational domain ; away from the centre , we impose that the normal fluid velocity decays exponentially - see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) . in the central region",
    "we place a number of vortex rings ( typically 40 ) as seeding initial condition at @xmath39 .",
    "the images which we present mainly refer to a numerical simulation in which the initial rings have the same radius but random orientation , and their centres are shifted according to a normal distribution , but it is important to note that we have performed simulations starting from different initial conditions ( e.g. rings of random positions and sizes ) and longer times in statistical steady - state regime , and the results appear to be independent of the precise initial vortex configuration .",
    "all numerical simulations are performed at a temperature @xmath40 ( corresponding to @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) which is typical of experiments .    during the evolution ,",
    "we observe that the vortex length rapidly increases in the central region due to the donnelly - glaberson instability , resulting in kelvin waves and vortex reconnections ( which continuously change the number of vortex loops ) ; a turbulent tangle of vortex lines quickly grows , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) . in the central region",
    "a balance is quickly reached between vortex generation and vortex decay , and the vortex length saturates .",
    "vortex loops which drift too far away from the central region decay due to friction with the stationary normal fluid in the outer region ; this effect helps create the desired saturated , localised region of quantum turbulence",
    ". characterised by fluctuations of the vortex length @xmath43 about an average value , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) . in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , note that the tangle does not necessarily remain isotropic during the evolution : given the random nature of the driving @xmath31 and the exponential growth of the donnelly - glaberson instability , a particular realisation of the synthetic turbulence may generate a vortex configuration which moves off - centre or does not extend by the same amount in all directions .",
    "in this section we analyse the dynamical , geometrical and topological properties of the steady - state regime of quantum turbulence which we have achieved .",
    "we have checked that not only the length , but also the kinetic energy @xmath44 of the vortex lines saturates to an average value , see fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the energy is evaluated from @xcite    @xmath45    ( where @xmath46 is volume ) . in our case , assuming that @xmath47 at infinity , since vorticity is concentrated along filaments , eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) reduces to    @xmath48    where the line integral extends over the entire vortex tangle @xmath29 .",
    "a quantity which is often reported in the literature as a measure of the turbulent intensity is the vortex line density ( length of vortex line per unit volume ) , defined as @xmath49 . without boundaries ,",
    "the volume which contains the lines is not a well - defined quantity ; we estimate it as the sphere which contains @xmath50 of the vortex lines . in the simulation shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath51    further analysis is performed using the concept of _ crossing numbers_. at a given instant , the turbulent vortex tangle consists of a number of vortex loops : @xmath52 .",
    "we project the tangle @xmath29 onto a given 2d plane .",
    "the projected tangle is a self - intersecting curve : the points of intersection correspond to apparent crossings of @xmath29 as seen from the line of sight of the projection . since each loop is oriented ( by the sense of rotation of the superfluid velocity )",
    ", we can assign values @xmath53 to each point of intersection @xmath54 according to standard convention , see fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the total number of crossings , @xmath54 , is plotted vs time in fig .",
    "( [ figure6 ] ) ; this is the simplest measure of the complexity of the tangle .",
    "we can also readily define the _ writhing number _ of the entire tangle as    @xmath55    where the symbol @xmath56 denotes the average over a number of projections to make the result independent of a particular projection @xcite .",
    "ideally , the writhing number should be estimated by integrating over all solid angles ; in practice , this would be computationally expensive .",
    "numerical experiments @xcite suggest it suffices to average over a small number of projections .",
    "the results which we report are calculated simply    by projecting over the three cartesian planes .",
    "we find - see fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) - that the writhing number of the tangle achieves a statistically steady - state too .",
    "other geometrical and topological properties of individual vortex loops @xmath57 or of the entire tangle @xmath29 can be evaluated by suitably conditioning eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "for example , the writhing number @xmath58 of an individual loop @xmath57 is obtained by summing the crossing numbers restricted to vortex strands which belong to that particular loop :    @xmath59    another quantity of interest is the _ linking number _",
    "@xmath60 between loops @xmath61 and @xmath57 , which is defined as    @xmath62    this quantity , computed from a single arbitrary projection , is the same for any projection , as it can be easily verified @xcite .",
    "a measure of the topological complexity of the turbulence is the the _ total linkage _",
    "@xmath63 of the tangle , defined as    @xmath64    the physical importance of the linkage is that only vortex reconnections can undo the linking between two loops and each reconnection has an energy cost ( in terms of sound waves emitted ) .",
    "the total linkage vs time is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that the fluctuations of the linkage are relatively large , as few reconnections make a relatively large change for a small vortex configuration like ours , but the turbulence settles to an average value of linkage , which is @xmath65 in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 ] ) . the spontaneous formation of links has also been observed in a numerical simulation of decaying turbulence using the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "now we turn the attention to the _",
    "helicity_. in a classical fluid , the helicity is defined as @xcite    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the vorticity .",
    "what should be the correct definition of helicity in a quantum fluid is a hot topic in the current literature @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is that , on one hand , we would like a definition of helicity which is consistent with the classical definition of helicity , and , on the other hand , in a quantum fluid vorticity @xmath67 is zero everywhere with the exception of the axes of vortex lines ; more precisely , @xmath67 is a delta function on the vortex axis , which unfortunately is also the location where the velocity is undefined .",
    "it is worth remarking that in a classical fluid one thinks of the vortex core as a small bundle of mathematical vortex lines ; this allows an interpretation of helicity which contains internal twist . in a quantum fluid ,",
    "however , there is _ only one vortex line _ ( on the axis of the vortex - everywhere else the flow is potential ) . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we follow scheeler et al @xcite and interpret @xmath68 as _ centreline helicity _ defined as    @xmath69    an important physical property of the centreline helicity is that it is invariant under anti - parallel reconnections characteristic of fluid flows @xcite .",
    "( [ fig8 ] ) shows that the centreline helicity remains approximately constant during the time evolution .",
    "after the initial transient , the average value is @xmath70 .",
    "we also characterise the complexity of the turbulence by computing the relative distribution of vortex loops with a given value of writhe . the writhe distribution , shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig9 ] ) , suggests that although most loops have a small value of @xmath71 , at any instant there is a number of loops with large value .",
    "closer investigation confirms that these complex loops with more coils and twists than the average loop keep forming , decaying and reforming .",
    "examples of vortex loops with small and large values of @xmath71 are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the geometrical complexity described by the writhe spectrum seems associated with a similar topological complexity .",
    "a simple way to quantify the topology of a vortex loop is to determine the order @xmath72 of its alexander polynomial @xcite .",
    "the alexander polynomial @xmath73 is a topological invariant which can be easily computed by labelling segments of a loop between under - crossings when projected into a plane , followed by assigning coefficients to the relevant entries of a matrix for each segment , and then finding the determinant of the matrix with any single row and column removed @xcite .",
    "given the vortex configuration at any time @xmath4 , we compute the alexander polynomial of each vortex loop and find its order @xmath72 . for example the alexander polynomial of the trivial unknot is @xmath74 hence its order is @xmath75 .",
    "the simplest knot is the trefoil ( @xmath76 ) knot , which has alexander polynomial @xmath77 , hence its order is @xmath78 .",
    "any vortex loop which has an alexander polynomial of order @xmath79 is knotted , however the converse is not necessarily true : a long - standing problem of knot theory is the lack of a unique method of distinguishing knots from each other . in particular ,",
    "the alexander polynomial is not unique to a particular knot type .",
    "for example there exist knots which have the same alexander polynomial as the unknot @xcite , so the fact that a vortex loop has an alexander polynomial of order @xmath75 does not necessarily imply that it is an unknot . nevertheless , the order of the alexander polynomial of a loop is a more instructive measure of the loop s topology than its writhe .",
    "( [ fig11 ] ) shows the distribution of values of @xmath72 , which we refer to as the _ knot spectrum_. as for the writhe spectrum , the knot spectrum suggests that , at any instant , most vortex loops are unknots , but , there are always some loops with a high degree of topological complexity . fig .",
    "( [ fig12 ] ) shows the distribution of values of @xmath72 for the three most complex knots in a given vortex configuration ( that is , at each instant @xmath4 for a sample of values of @xmath4 ) : the figure confirms the robustness of the finding - in any vortex configuration there is always a small but consistent number of loops with nontrivial topology . in comparison , for random poligons",
    "the probability of a knot decreases exponentially with complexity @xcite .",
    "some examples of vortex loops with intermediate and large values of @xmath72 which we observed in our numerical simulations are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig13 ] ) .    finally , fig .",
    "( [ fig14 ] ) shows the relationship between the length of vortex loops , @xmath80 , and the order of their alexander polynomials , @xmath72 .",
    "it is apparent that complex knots tend to be long knots .",
    "the inset plots the data on linear - log scales and suggests that @xmath72 increases roughly exponentially with @xmath80 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the probability that a dna molecule is knotted increases with its length in a similar way @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have simultaneously related geometry , dynamics and topology of a small statistically - steady turbulent region of quantum vorticity away from boundaries ; we have chosen such a regime because it simplifies the calculation of topological properties and can be generated in the laboratory .",
    "we have shown that centreline helicity is preserved in a statistical steady - state regime like energy , length , writhing and linking . by examining the writhe and the order of the alexander polynomial of vortex loops",
    ", we have found that most of the loops are topologically trivial ( unknots ) , but there are always some vortex loops of great geometrical and topological complexity",
