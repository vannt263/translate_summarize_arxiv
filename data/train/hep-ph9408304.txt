    "the standard solar model ( ssm ) gives a very good description of the sun .",
    "an impressive confirmation of the ssm is given by helioseismological observations , which , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , agree with the ssm predictions at the level of @xmath9 for distances down to @xmath10 . as a matter of fact",
    "there are at least 12 ssm s whose predictions are in reasonable agreement  .",
    "all these models include the same physics , and the slight differences between their results are mostly caused by differences in the input parameters .    however , all ssm s predict neutrino fluxes which are in disagreement with the observations of all four neutrino experiments  @xcite ( see table  [ exp ] ) .",
    "this deficit of the detected solar neutrinos is referred to as the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) .",
    "the ssm has uncertainties that basically reflect the uncertainties in the input parameters .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the most important uncertainties in the neutrino fluxes can be described by three parameters , the central temperature @xmath1 , the @xmath4-factor @xmath3 for the @xmath11 cross section , and the ratio @xmath12 of the @xmath4-factors for the reactions @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the uncertainty in the central temperature actually sums up uncertainties in the astrophysical factor @xmath15 for the @xmath16 cross section , in the solar opacity , which depends in particular on the metal abundances @xmath17 and on possible collective plasma effects  @xcite , in age of the sun , and in some other quantities .",
    "one can distinguish between ssm s and nssm s .",
    "all ssm s consider the same physical processes , and use similar input parameters . on the contrary ,",
    "nssm s consider large changes of the input parameters , often outside their estimated uncertainties  @xcite , and/or introduce new physical processes . in practice",
    "we assume that ssm s are characterized by the input parameters and their uncertainties as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , which basically follows bahcall  @xcite .",
    "recently two new developments have attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "if confirmed , they can change dramatically the prediction for the solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "the first one is the measurement  @xcite of @xmath3 factor from the cross section of dissociation for the @xmath0b nuclei in the coulomb field of @xmath18pb : @xmath19 .",
    "the preliminary result gives @xmath20  ev  barn , which should be compared with the value @xmath21  ev  barn used by bahcall and pinsonneault  @xcite .",
    "this new result would imply a proportional reduction of the predicted @xmath0b neutrino flux , which would come close to the flux measured by kamiokande .",
    "the second new development consists in the theoretical consideration of collective plasma effects in the sun .",
    "these effects have the potentiality of lowering the solar opacity by as much as 18%  @xcite , with the consequent lowering of the theoretical prediction of the sun central temperature by @xmath22% .",
    "the previous considerations have motivated us to study nssm s where both the astrophysical factor @xmath3 and the sun central temperature are left almost as free parameters . as discussed in the next section , this freedom , and",
    "even more so the aforementioned effects , are insufficient to resolve the snp .",
    "it is possible to explain the observed @xmath0b neutrino flux , i.e. the kamiokande data , but it is not possible satisfy any two of the three experimental data ( chlorine , kamiokande and gallium ) simultaneously .",
    "the basic reason for this failure is that the snp affects now also the @xmath6be neutrinos , and not only the rare @xmath0b neutrinos  @xcite : the combination of the two gallium experiments with homestake or kamiokande , or the combination of homestake with kamiokande , implies a too low @xmath6be - neutrino flux . as concluded in sect .",
    "[ noastro ] , the astrophysical solution is strongly disfavored .    the msw mechanism  @xcite offers the attractive possibility of selective suppression of the @xmath6be neutrinos , and reconciling the ssm with experiments .",
    "after having examined the input parameter uncertainties and the nssm s as possible solutions to the snp , it is only fair to examine how they affect the msw solution .",
    "in particular , we ask whether the msw solution exists for values of @xmath3 and central temperature significantly different from the standard ones ( the range of @xmath3 considered includes the new preliminary result : @xmath23  ev  barn  @xcite ) .    in section  [ msw ]",
    ", we shall demonstrate the validity of the msw solution and its weak dependence on the input parameters .",
    "we find that considerable changes of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath1 affect the mixing angle , but @xmath7 remains practically the same .",
    "at present the result of any ( non - standard ) solar model calculation , also including uncertainties in the nuclear cross sections , is inconsistent not only with the combination of the chlorine and kamiokande data  @xcite , but also with the combinations of the gallium data ( gallex  @xcite and sage  @xcite ) with either the kamiokande  @xcite or chlorine  @xcite data . for a summary of the experimental data",
    "see table  [ exp ] .",
    "the physical problem is the @xmath6be/@xmath0b neutrino ratio .",
    "if both the chlorine and kamiokande data are correct within one standard deviation , the @xmath6be flux is negative .",
    "if we allow both experiments to go two standard deviations away from their central value , the @xmath6be flux must still be smaller than @xmath24 , i.e. less than 40% of its ssm value .    a _ model - independent _ analysis along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , which only uses the luminosity constraint , shows that the combination of the present data from the gallium experiments and from kamiokande also requires that the @xmath6be flux be smaller than @xmath25 ; larger values can be obtained only going more than two standard deviations from both data .",
    "these conclusions can be also derived from the comparison of the gallium and chlorine data .",
    "a similar result was recently obtained by bahcall  @xcite .",
    "nowadays the snp is the problem of beryllium neutrinos .",
    "the low @xmath6be flux , implied by the experimental data , is eventually the reason astrophysical solutions fail and , as we shall see , the msw solution is stable in mass .    at the @xmath26 level ,",
    "any two of the chlorine , kamiokande and gallium data implies for all existing ssm s that : @xmath27 the diminishing of the astrophysical @xmath3 factor to the value 1517  kev  barn can solve the boron neutrino problem , but the flux of @xmath6be neutrino remains too large for both the chlorine and gallium experiments .    in principle",
    ", we can not exclude a strong suppression of @xmath6be/@xmath0b ratio by nuclear physics effects , but we are able to obtain this effect only at the price of large and correlated change of parameters , which eventually are unrealistic .",
    "let us give two examples .    increasing the @xmath28 factor we can make both fluxes , @xmath6be and @xmath0b , _ very _ low .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was demonstrated that increasing @xmath28 by factor 11.0 still gives a poor fit to the observational data . to overcome this difficulty we can increase the proton - capture rate on beryllium @xmath29 , and/or decrease the electron capture rate @xmath30 . in this manner we can increase the production of @xmath0b neutrinos proportionally to @xmath31 ( therefore compensating for the too large reduction caused by the increase of @xmath28 ) , and decrease the @xmath6be/@xmath0b ratio as @xmath32 .",
    "however , this game works only with a rather unrealistic combination of large correlated changes of two ( @xmath28 and @xmath30 ) or three ( @xmath28 , @xmath30 and @xmath29 ) parameters .    in ref .",
    "@xcite solar models with very generous changes of the input parameters are studied .",
    "these input parameters include the central temperature @xmath1 ( which  we recall  is determined by heavy element abundances , @xmath15 , solar age , new plasma effects , etc . ) , @xmath3 and @xmath33 .",
    "there it is demonstrated that arbitrary variations of any single one of these parameters are insufficient to explain the data of all four experiments .",
    "we can add to this demonstration the following proof of the impossibility of an astrophysical solution where we vary the central temperature , with the aim of suppressing the @xmath6be neutrino flux , and , at the same time , let the astrophysical factor @xmath3 be a free parameter , with the hope of fixing the @xmath0b neutrino flux .",
    "the basic point is that the scale laws for the fluxes are such that central temperature and/or @xmath3 variations yield : @xmath34 ^ 2 \\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fact the @xmath0b production is linearly proportional to @xmath3 , since only a tiny fraction of the @xmath6be nuclei terminate through the @xmath0b branch , and , therefore , the concentration of @xmath6be nuclei is practically independent of @xmath3 .",
    "the power of two in the @xmath6be flux comes about because , while the @xmath6be flux varies with temperature roughly as @xmath35 , the @xmath0b flux goes roughly as @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ belim ] ) and ( [ belaw ] ) imply that we need a central temperature reduction of about 10% , and eq .",
    "( [ blaw ] ) together with the fact that kamiokande sees at least 40% of the ssm @xmath0b flux implies that we need to increase @xmath3 of at least a factor 2.5 .    a more careful analysis that takes into account all three experiments confirms this result .",
    "we made a correlated @xmath37 analysis as function of the central temperature , and of the @xmath3 cross section .",
    "since this analysis is an extension of the one done in ref .",
    "@xcite for only two values of @xmath3 , we refer to it for details on the correlation matrix and the @xmath37 calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the iso-@xmath37 curves for ( a ) all data , ( b ) only the gallium and kamiokande data , and ( c ) only the gallium and chlorine data .",
    "we do not present the analysis of the kamiokande and chlorine data , which just confirms the well - know incompatibility .",
    "we find the best @xmath37 for the combination of gallium and chlorine data , as already seen in ref .",
    "but even if we consider this `` best '' combination , we obtain a @xmath37 that has a 2% probability of being a statistical fluctuations only for central temperatures at least 10% lower than the one predicted by the ssm , and @xmath3 larger than 60  ev  barn . for all other combinations of data",
    "we have not even been able of finding a @xmath37 compatible with statistical fluctuations at the level of 2% in the range of temperatures shown .",
    "the conclusion of these calculations is that we are not able to construct solar models that reproduce the experimental neutrino fluxes , even if we arbitrarily disregard one of the experiment . as a matter of fact",
    "most of the area in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] does not correspond to nssm s , as the ones in ref .",
    "@xcite , but to truly unrealistic models . in the example where we dial both central temperature and @xmath3 , for instance",
    ", the cross section @xmath3 needs to be much too large compared with its experimental determinations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we obtain central temperatures for which is not even possible to construct a solar model  @xcite ( in these cases we have used power - law extrapolations of solar model calculation ) .",
    "we see , therefore , that the combined results of all four neutrino experiments are incompatible with the astrophysical solution .",
    "if one insists upon this kind of solution , one must conclude that some of the experiments are wrong .",
    "following j.  bahcall  @xcite one can ask : `` how many solar neutrino experiments are wrong ? ''",
    "one can resolve the homestake / kamiokande conflict by assuming that either one is wrong .",
    "but then we are left with the conflict between the remaining experiment and the gallium experiments .",
    "should we say that both the kamiokande and chlorine experiments are wrong ?",
    "or is the gallium data together with either homestake or kamiokande that is wrong ?",
    "we think that it is more reasonable to consider the non - standard neutrino option , which can explain the results of all four neutrino experiments simultaneously .",
    "in this section we shall study the msw solution for nssm s .",
    "we shall start with a semiquantitative explanation of the reason @xmath7 is practically the same for the large class of ssm s and nssm s .",
    "the msw mechanism  @xcite suppresses the @xmath6be neutrinos as long as they satisfy the resonant condition in the sun : @xmath38 in this equation @xmath39  mev is the energy of the @xmath6be neutrinos , and @xmath40 is approximately equal to the electron density at the peak of the production region for the @xmath6be neutrinos ( we use 89% of the central electron density ) .",
    "let us derive first the minimum @xmath41 neutrino counting rate in the gallium experiments . to this end",
    "we take the @xmath26 lower limit for gallium experiments , @xmath42  snu , and subtract from it the @xmath0b and @xmath6be signals .",
    "the @xmath0b - neutrino contribution can be found from the @xmath43 upper limit of the kamiokande counting rate . as already said in the previous section ,",
    "the combination of any two neutrino data , gives a @xmath26 upper bound on the @xmath6be neutrinos of @xmath25 . as a result",
    "we obtain 33  snu as a very stringent lower limit ( @xmath26 away from all three neutrino data ) for the @xmath41 signal in the gallium experiments .",
    "therefore , we conclude that at least half of the @xmath41 signal survives .",
    "this condition results in the lower limit for @xmath7 : @xmath44 in this equation we use @xmath40 equal to the 67% of the central electron density , and @xmath45 is defined in such way that contribution of neutrinos with energies less than @xmath45 to a gallium detector is half of the total @xmath41 signal . since most of the @xmath41 signal in a gallium detector is produced by neutrinos near the upper end of the energy spectrum ( 0.420  mev ) we use , for the sake of discussion , @xmath46  mev .",
    "thus , if the msw mechanism is the solution to the snp , @xmath7 is bounded in a narrow interval , given by eqs .",
    "( [ highlim ] ) and ( [ lowlim ] ) , independently of the solar model we use .    when @xmath47 , the suppression is almost complete , and the exact value of @xmath8 determines only the width of the energy window where neutrinos are suppressed .",
    "for very small mixing angles , only the beryllium line is suppressed ; increasing @xmath8 we suppress more @xmath0b neutrinos and/or @xmath41 neutrinos ( depending on the value of @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore variations of astrophysical @xmath0b flux produce only variations of the mixing angle , but leave @xmath7 unaffected .    within the msw solution the kamiokande measurement @xmath48 ,",
    "gives the minimum value which a solar model can predict .",
    "for this flux we need no suppression of the @xmath0b neutrinos . the energy window must be very narrow , and centered on the beryllium line .",
    "the @xmath8 has the smallest value . for the opposite extreme case",
    ", the maximum value of the @xmath49 reasonably allowed by the parameter uncertainties is about @xmath50 .",
    "this value implies a strong msw suppression for both kamiokande and homestake , which in this case observe about one third of the predicted flux .",
    "then , a large angle solution , which give almost equal suppression for energy above the resonance , becomes more favorable .",
    "these qualitative results have been confirmed by a detailed @xmath37 analysis of the msw solutions as function of the astrophysically produced @xmath0b flux , and of the central temperature .",
    "the details of the calculations have already been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the ssm @xmath0b flux .",
    "here we use the same procedure for the two extreme cases of minimal @xmath0b flux compatible with kamiokande , and the maximal @xmath0b flux allowed by the present uncertainties , namely 2.09 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a .    in agreement with the semi - quantitative analysis given above",
    ", the reduced @xmath0b flux allows only the small angle solution ( labeled by 0.4 ) , which is shifted towards smaller angles in comparison with the ssm solution ( labeled by 1 ) . in this case , we obtain a relatively large @xmath37 ( 5.0 ) for the best fit .",
    "the reason is that this reduced flux is barely compatible with the kamiokande result .",
    "if we use a slightly larger flux , e.g. 0.5 of the ssm value , we obtain a @xmath37 similar to the other cases .    when the @xmath0b flux increases above the ssm value , the large angle solution becomes more favorable .",
    "the allowed region becomes larger and its statistical weight increases .",
    "simultaneously the small angle solution moves towards larger angles . for an increment described by a factor 2 ( not shown in the figure )",
    ", the best fit corresponds to the large angle solution .",
    "let us now examine the influence of the other uncertainties on the msw solution .",
    "we parameterized these uncertainties by central temperature , which affects both @xmath0b and @xmath6be neutrino fluxes .",
    "one might worry that this parameterization does not cover all solar models , and does not describe the possible correlations between neutrino fluxes  @xcite .",
    "a priori this criticism is correct .",
    "however , several numerical studies have shown that , in practice , the effects of independent variations of the metal fraction z / x , the opacities , the astrophysical factor @xmath52 , and the sun age are well reproduced by variation of the central temperature of the sun  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0b flux depends much more strongly on the central temperature than the @xmath6be flux , we expect that effect of the temperature variation should be qualitatively similar to the variation of the @xmath3 factor .",
    "we have performed the calculation varying @xmath1 within the range @xmath53 , which describes the uncertainties of the ssm and within the range @xmath54 , which corresponds to nssm s .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "the msw solution exists for all values of temperatures considered .",
    "one can see the stability of msw especially as the mass range is concerned .",
    "the mixing angle changes slightly with temperature : the cooler sun prefers the smaller mixing angles , while the hotter sun revives the otherwise dying large angle solution .",
    "we conclude this section with an issue which has been recently raised in a paper by gates , krauss and white  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that this effect does not change our conclusions .    the definition of the confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "regions is always a problem due both to our ignorance of the probability distribution , and to the different assumptions that one wants to test .",
    "our pragmatic approach is that we feel confident about conclusions that do not depend too much on the c.l .",
    "definitions , while we feel uneasy in the opposite case .",
    "for this reason , we use in our calculations two different definitions for 95% c.l .",
    "regions .",
    "the first definition , marked ( a ) in fig .  [ fig2 ] , answers the following question : if the msw solution with the given parameters exists , what region of parameters has the 95% probability of containing these true parameters ?",
    "the maximum likelihood procedure ( with some extra assumptions ) tells us that this region is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the value of @xmath37 for the best fit , and @xmath57 depends on the number of parameters and on the c.l . for example , @xmath58 for 2 parameters and a 95% c.l .",
    "we used this definition in our previous publications  @xcite .",
    "the second definition ( b ) answers a different question : what is the region of parameters where the msw mechanism does not contradict the _ experimental data _ at a given c.l . ?",
    "again under some additional assumptions , this region is given by @xmath59 , where now @xmath60 depends on the number of data points and the c.l .",
    "for example , @xmath61 for 3 experiments and a 95% c.l .    note that definition ( a ) will always give us some confidence region , since we assume that the msw mechanism exists , while definition ( b ) can yield no allowed region at all : in this case we conclude that the msw mechanism fails to provide the given c.l .",
    "in fact , only when @xmath56 is large ( bad fit ) the two definitions give qualitatively different regions : in this case we should worry about the original assumption under which ( a ) is valid , i.e. that the msw solution exists .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that for our purposes the two definitions are very similar , and can not change our conclusions .",
    "the same is true for all our calculations , and , therefore , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have used only the first definition for the confidence regions .",
    "for standard massless neutrinos the data of any two solar neutrino measurements ( chlorine , kamiokande and gallium ) are incompatible .",
    "the incompatibility of the chlorine and kamiokande data is a well recognized problem  @xcite .",
    "the conflict between the gallium and kamiokande data , and between the gallium and chlorine data , can be shown in different ways .",
    "one can obtain  @xcite a rigorous model - independent lower limit for the gallium detector counting rate by neglecting the @xmath6be neutrino flux , using the observational lower limit for the @xmath0b neutrino flux , and taking the flux of @xmath41 neutrinos from the solar luminosity restriction .",
    "it gives @xmath62  snu to be compared with the combined result of the two gallium experiments @xmath63  snu .",
    "using the gallium data , the luminosity constraint , and the lower limit for the flux of @xmath0b neutrinos from either homestake or kamiokande , one can derive  @xcite a model - independent limit on the @xmath6be neutrino flux .",
    "the updated limit using the new gallium data  @xcite is @xmath64 ( @xmath26 ) , i.e. less than @xmath65 of the ssm value .",
    "most recently j.  n.  bahcall  @xcite found that the @xmath6be neutrino signal in a gallium detector is less than 19  snu at the 95% c.l .",
    ", about half of the 36  snu predicted by the ssm .",
    "we have demonstrated that there are no values of @xmath3 and @xmath1 , the two most important solar - model parameters as neutrino fluxes are concerned , which satisfy the combination of any two experimental data out of three ( chlorine , kamiokande and gallium ) .    nowadays , the essence of solar neutrino problem is the low @xmath6be neutrino flux .",
    "nuclear / astrophysical solutions to the solar neutrino problem are strongly disfavored .",
    "the msw mechanism offers a very attractive solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the new measurements of @xmath3 factor  @xcite and collective plasma effects  @xcite can considerably change the solar - model parameters @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",

    "in particular , @xmath7 is restricted to the range @xmath66 .",
    "the physical reason of this stability is the fact that the solar neutrino experiments observe most of the predicted flux of @xmath41 neutrinos , and very small fraction of the @xmath6be neutrino flux .",
    "solar - model predictions for the @xmath0b neutrino flux are only important for the determination of the mixing angle .",

    "the large angle solution disappears for models with reduced @xmath0b neutrino flux .",
