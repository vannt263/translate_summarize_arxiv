    "after the seminal paper by maldacena @xcite , many efforts have been devoted to extend the gauge / gravity correspondence to less supersymmetric and non - conformal cases . in this context considerable attention",
    "was recently directed to the study of fractional branes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these are the natural elementary d - branes occurring whenever string theory is reduced on a ( not necessarily compact ) orbifold @xcite , @xcite-@xcite . because of their nature they can not move away from the orbifold apex and thus the dual gauge theory on their world - volume lacks the relevant moduli fields .",
    "generically , this leads to both reduced supersymmetry and non - vanishing @xmath6-functions .",
    "most interesting are the fractional d3-branes , namely the case when the world - volume theory is four - dimensional . in this respect",
    "the two most appealing situations are provided by the @xmath7 case emerging from singular limits of cy spaces and the @xmath2 case arising from the singular limit of ale spaces .",
    "much work was devoted to both .",
    "a common feature of many supergravity solutions representing non - conformal situations is the presence of naked singularities of repulson type @xcite .",
    "these correspond to ir singularities at the gauge theory level and one expects that they should be resolved or explained by some stringy effect . although a general recipe does not seem to exist , progress in understanding such an issue was made both for the @xmath7 and the @xmath2 case .    in the present talk",
    "i review recent work done in collaboration with other authors @xcite where it was found that the bulk solution of type iib supergravity corresponding to fractional @xmath8 can be generalized to the situation where the transverse space to the brane has a smooth regular geometry and the topology of @xmath9 the last factor in this product denoting a resolved asymptotically locally euclidean @xmath10manifold . in our solution that is shown to be supersymmetric and hence describe a bps state of string theory there is a non zero value of the complex type iib supergravity 3-form in the transverse directions .",
    "note that this is the distinctive feature of fractional d - branes in the singular orbifold theories .",
    "our bulk supergravity solution is a warped solution , but differently from the case of usual branes the warp factor depends on two rather than one radial variables and obeys a complicated partial differential equation .",
    "actually the whole set of iib equations can be reduced to the solution of such an equation for the warp factor , whose source is essentially dictated by supersymmetry up to an arbitrary analytic function @xmath11 .",
    "supergravity alone is not sufficient to determine @xmath11 or the boundary conditions .",
    "this arbitrariness implies that our solution describes various deformation or various vacua of @xmath12 theories .",
    "the case @xmath13 describes a vanishing three - form flux and corresponds to the well known conformal @xmath12 theory with product gauge group @xmath14 , hyper - multiplets in the bi  fundamental representation and fayet - iliopoulos terms describing the ale moduli .",
    "the new ingredient in the construction of @xcite is the following .",
    "it was shown how , at the supergravity level , a three - form flux can be turned on consistently with supersymmetry .",
    "consequences of this for the dual gauge theory are the goal of a new investigation that is still ongoing .",
    "as it is well known , type iib supergravity does not have any conventional supersymmetric action . however , as it happens for all on - shell supergravity theories , the complete set of field equations can be obtained as consistency conditions from the closure of the supersymmetry transformation algebra @xcite . in the case of type iib supergravity ,",
    "one was also able @xcite to obtain a complete , manifestly @xmath15-covariant formulation of the theory based on the rheonomic approach to supergravity theory @xcite .",
    "the bosonic part of the equations can be formally obtained through variation of the following action : is equal to @xmath16 , @xmath17 being the normalization of the scalar curvature usually adopted in general relativity textbooks .",
    "the difference arises because in the traditional literature the riemann tensor is not defined as the components of the curvature @xmath1-form @xmath18 rather as @xmath19 times such components . ]",

    "the corrections to the above behavior can be systematically deduced from the power series expansion of the solution described in @xcite .",
    "looking at eq.([hregcy ] ) , it is clear that there could be a value of @xmath203 for which @xmath204 , this being an indication for the presence of a naked singularity of the repulson type @xcite .",

    "an interesting point is that the above result holds even in the absence of the three - form flux and shows that conformal invariance of the dual theory is always broken since the metric in @xmath214 and @xmath215 is no longer of anti de sitter type .",

    "as explained in the literature @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) we can always consider sphere reductions of all supergravity theories and in particular an @xmath175-reduction of type iib supergravity .",
    "this yields an effective @xmath103-dimensional supergravity that has @xmath76-brane solutions . in this case",
    "however , there is a coupling to an effective dilaton that emerges as the conformal factor of the metric in the dimensional reduction .",
    "hence the @xmath8-brane solution of the @xmath103-dimensional supergravity is no longer conformal and we can follow the prescription of townsend et al @xcite by making the transition to a _ dual frame _ where the metric factorizes into the product of a @xmath76-sphere metric times a domain wall solution of an effective five - dimensional supergravity theory .    investigating the relation with the effective @xmath103dimensional supergravity and the properties of the dual gauge theory on the world volume are the challenging open problems posed by the type iib solution i have described in this talk",
    "it is my pleasure to thank my collaborator and friend mario trigiante for help in preparing this talk and all the coauthors of paper @xcite on which what i told is entirely based .",
