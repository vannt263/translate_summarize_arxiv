    "it was proved by h.  hasse in the case of elliptic curves ( @xmath56 ) , and first in full generality by a.  weil , using the intersection of divisors with the graph of frobenius in @xmath5 , and , in his second proof , the action of frobenius on the embedding of @xmath2 in its jacobian ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) ) . later proofs , based on one of weil s proofs ,",
    "have been given by p.  roquette  @xcite and others .",
    "there have been some attempts to translate the first and second proof to the situation of the riemann zeta function , when  @xmath2 is the ` curve '  @xmath57 , but so far without success , one of the obstacles being that in the category of schemes , @xmath6 is one - dimensional and not two - dimensional like  @xmath5 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a completely new technique was discovered by stepanov  @xcite in 1969 , initially only for hyperelliptic curves .",
    "w.  m.  schmidt  @xcite used his method to reprove the riemann hypothesis for @xmath40 , by w.  m.  schmidt uses hyperderivations . ] and a simplified proof was given by bombieri in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "bombieri s proof uses the graph of frobenius in   and the riemann  roch formula . , but he uses @xmath58 , i.e. , functions on @xmath5 . ] when bombieri was studying stepanov s proof , in order to understand the derivations in a geometric way , he used a standard connection on the curve .",
    "the argument worked only over the prime field because of the obstruction arising from iterating the connection @xmath24 times .",
    "however , bombieri found that derivatives of order @xmath24 gave the cartier operator , which turned out to be the same as taking the @xmath24-th power of the function .",
    "thus the final proof does not mention connections nor the cartier operator , and fits on a paper napkin @xcite .",
    "we present this proof in section  [ s : rh ] .",
    "a shorter exposition of bombieri s proof has appeared in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see the development in these proofs .",
    "gradually , more geometry that can not be translated to the number field case has been taken out .",
    "the question arises as to what exactly is needed to prove the riemann hypothesis for curves , and what we can learn from this about the riemann hypothesis for @xmath57 .",
    "weil s first proof uses the geometry of @xmath5 , and in particular the intersection of the graph of frobenius with the diagonal .",
    "there is some reason to believe that no analogue will ever exist for number fields , or else , that constructing an analogue is harder than establishing the riemann hypothesis .",
    "his second proof uses the jacobian of  @xmath2 , and again , no analogue may ever be constructed for the integers .",
    "bombieri s proof uses very little of the geometry of @xmath5 , but it uses the action of frobenius and riemann  roch . since tate s thesis , it is known that the riemann  roch equality   translates into formula  .",
    "bombieri s proof naturally divides into two steps . in the first step",
    ", he uses the action of frobenius to obtain a discrete flow on the curve ( here called the _ frobenius flow _ ) , which he analyzes to obtain an upper bound for the number of points on the curve , which is a weak form of the prime number theorem for the curve ( see table  [ t : comparison ] ) .",
    "one sees that the horizontal coordinate of @xmath5 plays an ` arithmetic ' role , and the vertical coordinate plays a ` geometric ' role ( see remark  [ r : arith geo ] ) . in the second step",
    ", he uses the riemann hypothesis for  @xmath59 , and the fact that the frobenius automorphism generates the local galois group ( decomposition group ) at a point on the curve , to obtain a lower bound for the number of points on the curve . combining the two steps",
    ", he first obtains the analogue of the prime number theorem with a good error term , and from this it is a small step to deduce the riemann hypothesis ( see lemma  [ l : rh ] ) .",
    "therefore , one might conclude that the right approach to the riemann hypothesis is to first prove the prime number theorem with a good bound for the error term .",
    "looking at the first step of bombieri s proof , one might even believe that the key to a prime number theorem with a good error bound is to construct a function ( possibly a fourier or dirichlet polynomial , in the spirit of the methods of baker , gelfond and schneider ) that vanishes at the first @xmath60 primes to a high order .",
    "if one could bound the degree of this polynomial , one would obtain an upper bound for the number of primes .",
    "this would already imply the riemann hypothesis , so the second step becomes unnecessary . in section  [ s : speculations ] we make some speculations about how to translate bombieri s proof to number theory .",
    "recently , alain connes found a completely new method again  @xcite , based on the work of shai haran  @xcite , using harmonic analysis on the ring of adeles .",
    "connes conjectures that weil s explicit formula is obtained as the trace of a certain shift operator , and then establishes the positivity of this trace , thus proving the riemann hypothesis for @xmath57 and for all l - functions associated with a grssencharakter , up to a ` lemma ' about special functions . he does not use the action of frobenius .",
    "( see however remark  [ r : shift ] . )",
    "throughout , we fix a function field @xmath61 of transcendence degree one over a finite field of characteristic @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the algebraic closure of @xmath51 in @xmath61 , i.e. , the field of constants of @xmath61 , is @xmath26 , and we choose a function @xmath62 such that @xmath61 is a finite separable extension of the field of rational functions @xmath63 , which we denote by @xmath64 , @xmath65 thus , @xmath66/(m(t , x))\\ ] ] for some polynomial @xmath67 , irreducible over the algebraic closure @xmath68 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath61 is the field of functions on a curve @xmath2 given by @xmath69 , and the choice of @xmath70 corresponds to the choice of a projection of @xmath2 onto @xmath59 .",
    "adding extra coordinates @xmath71 if necessary , we can obtain a nonsingular model for @xmath2 .",
    "valuations of @xmath61 correspond to orbits of points on @xmath2 in the following way .",
    "the frobenius automorphism acts on algebraic points in @xmath72 by raising each coordinate of a point to the @xmath3-th power , @xmath73 this action of frobenius induces a discrete dynamical system on @xmath72 , which we call the _ frobenius flow _ on @xmath2 ( see figure  [ f : frobenius ] ) .",
    "so a point in @xmath74 that is not defined over a smaller field of constants gives an orbit of this flow of @xmath75 points .",
