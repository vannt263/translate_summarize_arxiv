    "two - dimensional josephson junction arrays are considered as strong candidates for tunable microwave oscillators .",
    "since the pioneering works by benz and burroughs@xcite there were some attempts to fabricate arrays of this type@xcite as well as to understand them theoretically @xcite .",
    "( for two recent reviews on 2d josephson junction arrays , see lachenmann @xcite and booi@xcite . )",
    "while radiation output of two - dimensional arrays should be much larger than that of one - dimensional arrays ( for quadratic arrays in the matched case typically @xmath0 , with @xmath1=number of rows , compared to being @xmath2 , with @xmath1=number of junctions , for one - dimensional arrays@xcite ) observations point more to the opposite direction . while in one - dimensional arrays",
    "there were observed up to 160@xmath3w,@xcite the output power reported in two - dimensional arrays is several orders of magnitude smaller with a maximum of around 400nw@xcite .",
    "potentially , there can be several reasons responsible for this discrepancy . besides low critical currents / normal resistances , mismatch to the external load , or parameter tolerances some more basic problems might be responsible for this .",
    "indeed , some recent theoretical investigations show , that the radiating in - phase mode is neutrally stable in a unshunted array without external flux@xcite and , even worse , that it is unstable even for a small flux entering the cell@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the natural state of at least the simple model circuit studied in@xcite is a non - radiating one with both cells oscillating against each other . the situation can be improved by adding an appropriate external shunt synchronizing in - phase via its long - range interaction , but generally there remains a tendency that pairs of cells lock anti - phase and drop out of the radiating mode .",
    "a recently proposed layout@xcite removes this difficulty by introducing an additional capacitive shunt in the  horizontal  branches thus turning the internal coupling to favor the in - phase state .",
    "it is the aim of the present investigation , to give this idea an analytical foundation and derive some rigorous results , notably on the parameter boundaries separating in - phase from anti - phase oscillations .",
    "in addition , we study the interplay with an external load leading to a rather complex picture of possible stability regions as a result of the competition of external and internal synchronization .",
    "we start with an exposition of the problem including the basic equations in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii and iv these equations are solved by an analytical approximation , combining ideas of the strong coupling method appropriate for small - inductance josephson junction cells@xcite with the standard weak - coupling procedure of slowly - varying phase@xcite for the treatment of inter - cell coupling .",
    "while sec .",
    "iii contains lowest - order results corresponding to vanishing cell inductance , sec .",
    "iv includes the effects caused by a small , but non - vanishing inductance being essential for understanding the inter - cell coupling .",
    "v contains several results including a comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "the interplay with an external load is treated in sec .",
    "vi , and sec .",
    "vii contains several more general conclusions relevant for the layout of two - dimensional josephson junction arrays .",
    "for making the problem accessible to an analytical treatment , we have to make several propositions",
    "1 shows the circuit under consideration . to make the physical mechanisms more transparent ,",
    "the external shunt @xmath4 is removed in the beginning , and will only be included in sec . vi . despite its simplicity",
    "this model has all the main features present in larger arrays , too : it is truly two - dimensional with a possible flux entering the cells . notice , that unlike to conventional hybrid arrays@xcite the horizontal branch contains a more general shunt consisting not only of the usual inductive connection , but of a parallel capacitance and resistance .",
    "numerical results obtained before indicate that an intrinsic shunt of this type can favor in - phase locking even in an externally unshunted array . here",
    ", we will confirm and extend this result by developing an analytical formalism which should be applicable to larger two - dimensional arrays with the same general structure as well .",
    "some more restrictions have to be put on the array : ( i ) josephson junctions are described by the rsj model@xcite .",
    "( ii ) all junctions are considered to be identical .",
    "( iii ) junctions are overdamped with a mccumber parameter set to zero .",
    "( iv ) self - inductance is taken into account while mutual inductance is neglected .",
    "( v ) the normalized ring inductance between the two loops @xmath5 is supposed to be small ( @xmath6 ) . from the beginning",
    ", one has to understand that the inductance of the horizontal connection acts in a two - fold way . at first",
    ", it contributes to both ring inductances thus determining the squid coupling within each loop . at second ,",
    "it is part of the shunt common to both loops and as such it influences the inter - cell coupling . with eq .",
    "( [ lsmall ] ) we request the squid coupling to be strong , which is a necessary prerequisite for our approximation scheme to work . on the other hand",
    ", we will not fix the ratio between the inductive and the capacitive horizontal impedances from the beginning .    in the following",
    ", we will exploit some more normalized quantities as follows , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the junction critical current , @xmath9 the normal resistance of one of the ( identical ) junctions , @xmath10 the external flux per cell , and the last normalization being valid for all currents entering the calculation . adopting these normalizations ,",
    "the circuit can be described by the rsj equations for the josephson phases , @xmath11 in conjunction with the two flux quantization conditions @xmath12 ( minus sign refers to @xmath13 ) and kirchhoff s current laws @xmath14 these have to be supplemented by kirchhoff s voltage law @xmath15 we would like to point out that while the inductive branch carrying current @xmath16 is part of both superconducting loops thus contributing to the flux quantization conditions ( [ fluxquan ] ) , the branch @xmath17 enters only via the ordinary kirchhoff s law ( [ kirchhoff2 ] ) . as a result , it is impossible to simply substitute the three elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 by a single impedance z from the beginning .",
    "before , it has proven useful in the treatment of strongly coupled squid cells@xcite to combine the josephson phases within each cell via @xmath20 in addition , we introduce the circular currents @xmath21 with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ sigmadelta ] )  ( [ circular ] ) we finally obtain the system    [ basic ] @xmath22 which our analytical approximation scheme is based on . as there are seven equations for the seven variables @xmath23 this is a well - posed problem .",
    "our strategy for solving system ( [ basic ] ) will be based on a perturbative treatment valid for small @xmath24 ( for the basic idea compare our earlier paper@xcite ) .",
    "thus , we start solving eqs .",
    "( [ basic ] ) for @xmath25 , and only later include corrections @xmath26 exploiting the lowest order results obtained before .",
    "this procedure is favored by the fact that @xmath24 enters equation ( [ basic4 ] ) only .",
    "we start by evaluating ( [ basic4 ] ) in conjunction with ( [ basic3 ] ) .",
    "the solutions for @xmath27 can be used to evaluate @xmath28 from ( [ basic1 ] ) .",
    "next , we find the @xmath29 ( not the @xmath27 , which are already known in this order ! ) from ( [ basic2 ] ) . finally , with the ring currents @xmath29 on the right hand side of ( [ basic5 ] ) known we can evaluate the current @xmath17 by solving the corresponding differential equation .",
    "all other quantities , like @xmath16 or @xmath30 , are secondary and can be derived from the seven variables mentioned so far .",
    "afterwards , we insert the lowest order result on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ basic4 ] ) and start a second cycle in the same sequence .",
    "the procedure described above gives the following lowest - order results .",
    "first , the josephson phase differences in both loops are found to be identical , @xmath31 in the following , comma - delimited indices refer to the order of approximation . from ( [ basic1 ] ) ,",
    "the josephson phases are found to coincide with the corresponding solutions for an autonomous junction,@xcite @xmath32 with the important modification that the frequency @xmath33 becomes flux - dependent according to @xmath34    next , the circular currents can be evaluated from ( [ basic2 ] ) .",
    "note , that this equation originating from the original josephson equations does not lead to a differential equation , because the constant josephson phase differences @xmath27 are already known .",
    "the result is @xmath35 it is a trivial task to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ circ0 ] ) using ( [ sigma0 ] ) ; in the further calculation we will only need the lowest harmonics of the circular currents , @xmath36 the corresponding difference of the ring currents , @xmath37 enters the horizontal connection thus acting as a driving force for the oscillatory circuit according to eq .",
    "( [ basic5 ] ) . this equation can be solved with standard methods .",
    "the stationary oscillating solution reads @xmath38 here , we introduced the series circuit impedance @xmath39 with @xmath40 and the phase angle @xmath41 , @xmath42 rather than @xmath17 , because it is just @xmath16 which potentially may split the oscillation phases between cell 1 and cell 2 via eq .",
    "( [ basic4 ] ) . combining ( [ irc ] ) with ( [ ibar ] ) after some algebra we obtain @xmath43 where we introduced the @xmath44 impedance @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( in principle , one could evaluate @xmath16 directly from an equation similar to ( [ basic5 ] ) of course , and we checked that the result is the same . the procedure described here",
    "has the advantage of additionally providing an expression for the current flowing through the capacitive line . )    to summarize , we observe the following lowest - order results : all four junctions oscillate with the same flux - dependent frequency @xmath48 . because of ( [ delta0 ] ) , the junctions within each cell are exactly in phase , while the relative phase between cell 1 and cell 2 ( given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ) is undetermined , up to now . if both cells are in phase , there is no current through the horizontal line , because of the @xmath51 $ ] present in ( [ ibar0 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the horizontal current reaches its maximum if both cells oscillate anti - phase with @xmath52 .",
    "now we are ready to include inductance effects . again starting with ( [ basic3 ] ) and ( [ basic4 ] ) , we insert the lowest - order result ( [ il0 ] ) on the right hand side of ( [ basic4 ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 note , that the first index in ( [ delta12 ] ) refers to cell 1 and cell 2 , respectively , while the second one indicates the order of evaluation ; the @xmath54 sign refers to @xmath55 .",
    "this has to be inserted into ( [ basic1 ] ) , @xmath56 for evaluating these equations the cosine on the left hand side is expanded according to @xmath57 after transferring the correction term @xmath26 to the right hand side of ( [ sigmak1 ] ) one makes the crucial observation , that it acts in a similar way as , for example , an external shunt synchronizing the cells@xcite .",
    "the resulting equations are evaluated with the conventional phase - slip method ( see , for instance@xcite ) . according to this procedure which has proven useful in the treatment of linear arrays before ,",
    "the up to now constant phases @xmath49 and @xmath50 are considered as time dependent , @xmath58 with the subsidiary condition that this time - dependence is only an adiabatic one , @xmath59 physically , this means that the phases are required to be nearly constant during one josephson oscillation .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the same ansatz ( [ sigma0 ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath61 instead of @xmath33 leads to the sum voltages @xmath62 , @xmath63 writing @xmath61 instead of @xmath33 we have allowed for a possible ( small ) deviation of the actual oscillation frequency from @xmath33 . inserting ( [ sigma1 ] ) into ( [ sigmak1 ] )",
    "leads to the reduced equations @xmath64    after averaging over one time period and applying some algebra we arrive at the following system of equations ( for details see , for instance@xcite )    [ delta1 - 2 ] @xmath65    where @xmath66 denotes the time average over one josephson oscillation .",
    "the difference of ( [ delta1 ] ) and ( [ delta2 ] ) gives an evolution equation for the phase difference @xmath67 , @xmath68 eq .",
    "( [ deltasol ] ) is the basic equation determining the possible phase differences between the oscillations of both cells as well as the corresponding regions of stability .",
    "we will not go into the question of general solutions of ( [ deltasol ] ) but concentrate on phase - locking , being characterized by a time - independent phase - shift between cell 1 and cell 2 , @xmath69 within the range @xmath70 there are obviously only two possibilities for eq .",
    "( [ deltadot1 ] ) to be valid , @xmath71 the first one describing in - phase oscillations and the second one anti - phase oscillations of the cells .",
    "the crucial question of the range of stability of these two solutions can be answered on the basis of the evolution equation ( [ deltasol ] ) , too .",
    "the ansatz @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) leads to the lyapunov coefficient @xmath74 one recovers , that the stability is solely determined by the @xmath75 ; all the remaining factors , except @xmath76 , are positive definite . in detail , the @xmath77 while the @xmath78    before further evaluating this condition we will consider the oscillation frequency which can be derived from ( [ delta1 ] ) ( or ( [ delta2 ] ) ) . with @xmath79 one easily recovers @xmath80 evaluating the anti - phase frequency with @xmath81 needs a bit more algebra .",
    "the result is @xmath82 thus , if both cells oscillate in - phase their frequency is identical to the autonomous oscillation frequency . on the other hand , if the cells oscillate anti - phase the frequency will be lower than @xmath33 . the physical reason for this behavior can be understood by comparing with other ( even linearly ) oscillating systems : if the bindings ( in our case realized by the horizontal impedance ) are not loaded , the oscillation frequency remains the same as for uncoupled oscillators ; if the bindings are loaded ( i.e. in case of a ac current flowing through the horizontal line ) the system oscillates with a different frequency .",
    "unfortunately , one has to respect a certain limit of validity of eq .",
    "( [ zetaanti ] ) . using the method of slowly varying phase we have adopted the supposition mentioned before that the frequency must not deviate too much from @xmath33 , @xmath83 thus , the correction in eq .",
    "( [ zetaanti ] ) is required to be small compared to the frequency itself .",
    "a rough estimate valid for @xmath84 leads to the condition @xmath85 our experience shows that usually a factor of @xmath86 is sufficient for this condition to be fulfilled .",
    "now we return to the question of anti - phase @xmath87 in - phase transitions described by ( [ inanticos1 ] ) and ( [ inanticos2 ] ) , resp . considering the numerator of @xmath75",
    "one observes that the boundary separating in - phase and anti - phase oscillations of the cells is given by @xmath88 with the cells oscillating anti - phase if the left hand side is positive and in - phase if it is negative .",
    "in other words , the transition between both regimes lies in the vicinity of the resonance curve of the @xmath24-@xmath89-@xmath19 connection with deviations becoming important for small @xmath24 .",
    "2 shows the boundary between the two regimes for a frequency @xmath90 in comparison to numerical results .    to summarize",
    ", the in - phase regime is favored for not too large @xmath19 as long as the inductive impedance dominates over the capacitive one , while for the capacitive impedance dominating the cells oscillate anti - phase .",
    "there is a simple physical explanation for this : anti - phase oscillations are caused by the flux coupling via the joint inductive line carrying current @xmath16 . for a sufficiently large capacitive shunt ,",
    "the current prefers the capacitive way which does not produce any such flux .    in conventional hybrid",
    "arrays@xcite horizontal lines are purely inductive .",
    "formally , this limit can be observed letting @xmath91 . in this case",
    "the capacitive impedance goes to infinity while the correction @xmath92 tends to zero .",
    "then , there is no possibility for the current to be shunted , and the cells remain in the anti - phase regime@xcite . the more general question , for which parameter values @xmath18 , and @xmath19 there are no transitions can be answered on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ transgen ] ) .",
    "this equation does only have real solutions for @xmath61 if @xmath93 for all smaller @xmath24 , the current in the inductive line is strong enough to keep the cells oscillating anti - phase .",
    "considering the circuit parameters @xmath94 etc . as constant and leaving the external flux @xmath95 as the only free parameter one can observe flux - induced transitions between both regimes .",
    "the difference between the frequencies @xmath96 and @xmath97 leads to a hysteresis , which has been observed in numerical simulations before@xcite . in more detail , in - phase @xmath98",
    "anti - phase transitions are observed at @xmath99,\\ ] ] where we introduced the transition frequency @xmath100 as can be easily deduced from ( [ transgen ] ) .",
    "the transition from the anti - phase to the in - phase regime needs a bit more algebra .",
    "it can be determined from the requirement , that the anti - phase frequency ( [ zetaanti ] ) be equal to the transition frequency ( [ transfreq ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting equation can not be solved in closed form . however , as a first approximation , one can equate the in@xmath98anti transition frequency ( [ transfreq ] ) with ( [ zetaanti ] ) and evaluate for @xmath95 , substituting @xmath101 on the right hand side of ( [ zetaanti ] ) , @xmath102 it can be deduced , that @xmath103 is always larger than @xmath104 . a better result for @xmath103 is obtained by graphically finding the transition frequency on the curve at @xmath105 .",
    "thus , if there are any transitions between both regimes at all , for small values of the external flux the cells oscillate with the lower anti - phase frequency switching to in - phase oscillations at @xmath106 . because of @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) switching back to the anti - phase state occurs at a lower flux , leading to the hysteresis mentioned above .",
    "3 shows a plot of frequency against flux in comparison with the outcome of a numerical simulation .",
    "the frequencies are in excellent agreement , and even the transition points , which depend rather sensibly on the parameters , are located within the same region .",
    "this last result concerning hysteresis has to be taken with some care .",
    "it was obtained by combining the anti - phase frequency formula ( [ zetaanti ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ transgen ] ) and evaluating for @xmath95 .",
    "however , ( [ transgen ] ) as originating from ( [ deltasol ] ) is already a first order result , thus inserting ( [ zetaanti ] ) might not be fully justified while second order terms in ( [ deltasol ] ) are neglected .",
    "nonetheless , it gives a plausible explanation for the mechanism causing the hysteresis observed in numerical simulations .",
    "it has been well - known for a long time that synchronization in a one - dimensional array can be achieved and controlled by shunting the array via an external load@xcite . in a similar manner",
    "one may hope to be able to control row locking in two - dimensional arrays , too . for studying this mechanism within our model",
    "we now add the external load already indicated in fig .",
    "1 . as a result",
    ", we have to supplement the basic equations ( [ basic ] ) . at first , we add the mesh rule for the load current @xmath109 , @xmath110 here , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the load impedances normalized in the same manner as ( [ lsmall ] ) , ( [ cnorm ] ) , and ( [ rnorm ] ) .",
    "in addition , the load current couples back to the junctions , thus supplementing eq .",
    "( [ basic1 ] ) , @xmath113    as has been observed in the study of similar one - dimensional synchronization problems before , the reciprocal impedance @xmath114 provides another perturbation parameter for a sufficiently large load ; thus we evaluate the system perturbatively , neglecting terms @xmath115 .",
    "to lowest order with respect to @xmath116 the load current vanishes , and we end up with the results described in sec .",
    "iii . based on the lowest order josephson oscillations ( [ sigma0 ] ) and the corresponding voltages @xmath117 we",
    "obtain the first order ( with respect to @xmath118 ) load current @xmath119 , @xmath120 with    @xmath121 ) .",
    "however , one should note two differences : ( i ) while the load current is maximal for @xmath122 , the horizontal current reaches its maximum for @xmath123 .",
    "( ii ) the horizontal current vanishes if both cells oscillate in - phase , while the load current vanishes for both cells oscillating anti - phase .",
    "the load current ( [ loadcurrsol ] ) provides the additional contribution to ( [ sumnew ] ) and , as a result , the phase slip equations ( [ delta1 - 2 ] ) get an additional term , too .",
    "after performing the time - averages we get    [ newdeltas ] @xmath124    by subtracting ( [ newdeltas1 ] ) and ( [ newdeltas2 ] ) , we finally get the evolution equation for the averaged oscillation phase difference , @xmath125 despite the relatively complicated interplay between cell interaction via the horizontal line and long range coupling via the external load there remain only the same two phase locking solutions as before , @xmath71 the stability of which is determined by the lyapunov coefficient @xmath126    in - phase oscillations of the cells are stable if the term in parenthesis is lower than zero while anti - phase oscillation are stable if it is greater than zero .",
    "thus , the desired stability for the in - phase mode is reached for @xmath127 eq .",
    "( [ stabload ] ) shows a rather complex parameter dependence , relating the seven parameters @xmath128 and @xmath95 .",
    "its physical meaning is best discovered considering several limiting cases .",
    "\\(i ) for a sufficiently large external load , @xmath129 the relative phase of the cells is determined by the internal coupling alone .",
    "this has to be compared to the case of two externally loaded separate cells@xcite . in this case  as for linear arrays  the relative phase depends on the character of the external load only : while for inductively dominated loads the cells are locked in - phase , they are locked anti - phase for capacitively dominated loads , independently of the magnitude of the external load .",
    "\\(ii ) the contributions from the external load and from the internal shunt show a different flux dependence . for sufficiently small values of external flux",
    "the last term can be neglected , and the locking regime is controlled by the load only . on the other hand , for flux values of around half a flux quantum the first term becomes negligible , and the internal horizontal line determines the phase difference of the cells .",
    "\\(iii ) for @xmath130 , the second term can be neglected , and the result agrees with that obtained for two separate cells before@xcite , as it should be . in this limit",
    "the cells internally decouple , while the external coupling remains in force .",
    "\\(iv ) the usual hybrid arrays without the internal @xmath131-@xmath132-line are contained as a limiting case . for @xmath133 ,",
    "the in - phase - condition , eq . ( [ stabload ] ) , reduces to @xmath134 it states , that for sufficiently large inductances , @xmath135 ordinary pure inductive hybrid arrays may switch to the anti - phase state even for inductive external loads .",
    "the indicated transition was indeed observed in a numerical simulation ( boxes in fig .",
    "4 ) . having in mind that eq .",
    "( [ hybridinanti ] ) is the result of several approximations , concerning the external shunt as well as the internal inductive coupling , the agreement is remarkably good .",
    "the influence of changing parameters can be nicely illustrated by performing a second simulation with exactly the same parameter set , but distributing ring inductance @xmath24 regularly around the loops .",
    "the result denoted by the dots in fig .",
    "4 clearly deviates from that obtained for inductance concentrated on the horizontal line considered before .",
    "this can be taken as a strong indication that the coupling is not provided by the loop inductances but by the inductance on the line common to both cells .",
    "although our work is devoted to the study of a simple model circuit several results are expected to be valid for larger arrays , too . at first",
    ", the short range coupling between neighboring cells leads to an anti - phase synchronization in conventional josephson junction hybrid arrays .",
    "this may be one reason for explaining the very small radiation output in 2d josephson junction arrays obtained so far . at second",
    ", we show a way to improve the situation by adding a capacitive shunt parallel to the horizontal lines . in this way",
    ", the flux - generating current potentially responsible for the anti - phase coupling is redirected through the capacitive line which is not part of a flux quantization condition .    combining fig .",
    "2 with some already known facts on synchronization in strongly coupled squid cells@xcite the following design criteria for generalized hybrid 2d josephson junction arrays can be derived .",
    "( i ) for synchronizing horizontal lines in - phase the ring inductances have to be kept small ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "( ii ) in - phase synchronization between neighboring cells in vertical direction is observed for @xmath136 . based on this , we will derive some estimates for reasonable @xmath89 and @xmath24 .",
    "for a given @xmath24 , the boundary between in- and anti - phase oscillations is given by eq .",
    "( [ transgen ] ) .",
    "2 shows already that the additional term @xmath137 restricts the possible @xmath24 by setting a lower bound .",
    "this bound is obtained from @xmath138 as @xmath139 thus , for obtaining in - phase oscillations the condition @xmath140 has to be respected .",
    "because of ( [ cr ] ) this means @xmath141 obviously , the requirement to have a small @xmath24 for horizontal in - phase synchronization leads to the demand to have a sufficiently high capacitance @xmath142 as well as a small resistance @xmath143 .",
    "a reasonable compromise might for instance be @xmath144    of cause , all these estimates should be considered as very rough , and on the other hand , one has to check carefully how large these quantities on chip actually are .",
    "on the other hand , we would like to point out that these suggestions are based on an analytical approximation scheme and are founded on solid formulae . of cause",
    ", it still has to be shown rigorously that they can be transferred to larger arrays as well .",
    "some preliminary results from numerical simulations indeed indicate this .",
    "we hope , that the general procedure described here can be transferred to larger arrays of the type considered here as well , and some work is on the way to actually extend it to a ladder configuration .",
    "if the arrays are externally loaded , which is usually done via an inductive load , the parameters have to be chosen in such a manner to respect eq .",
    "( [ stabload ] ) .",
    "the best way for obtaining in - phase synchronization is to make both contributions to the lyapunov - coefficient lower than zero separately , which is possible because the parameters of the external load can be chosen independently of those from the internal shunt . in general",
    ", one should select values such , that ( i ) the external load is dominated by its inductive contribution , ( ii ) the internal horizontal shunts are dominated by the inductive impedance , too .",
    "because of the frequency - dependence of the characters of the shunts , one has to make sure , that these conditions are met for all values of external flux .    of cause",
    ", the circuit studied here has several features requiring a more detailed investigation , either analytically or numerically .",
    "usually one exploits shunted tunnel junctions for building arrays , thus one may ask for the influence of non - vanishing mccumber parameters . on the other hand , the influence of parameter splitting needs to be investigated , and in addition , in real arrays , noise comes into play .",
    "while this last aspect is to be expected to play only a minor role within the small inductance loops , it will be sure have some influence on the coupling between the cells .",
