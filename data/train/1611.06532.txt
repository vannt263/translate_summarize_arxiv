    "* lecture 18 ) as an introduction to the topic .",
    "there are several non - trivial @xmath0-webs formed by line- and circle - families , see @xcite for history of the problem and new examples of such webs .",
    "in this paper we consider webs in the positive quadrant @xmath3 formed by confocal conics and pencils of _ apollonian circles _",

    "we refer to @xcite for this and other classical results related with circles and conics .",
    "we construct four webs defined in the positive quadrant @xmath3 .",
    "these webs consist of the following families of curves : + _ 1 ) both families of apollonian circles and confocal hyperbolas with foci @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; + 2 ) both families of apollonian circles and confocal ellipses with foci @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; + 3 ) families of confocal ellipses , confocal hyperbolas and the hyperbolic appolonian pencil with foci @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; + 4 ) families of confocal ellipses , confocal hyperbolas and the elliptic appolonian pencil with foci @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "_    we prove the existence of these webs by showing a diffeomorphism from a domain @xmath8 to the positive quadrant @xmath3 which maps horizontal , vertical and `` diagonal '' ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 is a constant ) lines to considered curves .",
    "for webs @xmath0 and @xmath11 the images of both diagonal direction are remarkable curve : apollonian circles and lines ( vertical or horizontal ) .    before going to the proof ,",
    "let us say how these pencils relate with each other in an algebraic sense .",
    "all circles in the plane can be considered as conics passing through two fixed points of the complex infinite line .",
    "these points are called _ circular _ and have homogeneous coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "foci @xmath4 and @xmath5 of any conic @xmath14 can be described as the intersection of tangent lines to @xmath14 from the circular points .",
    "the other pair of points of the intersection , denote it by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , can also be considered as foci . on figure",
    "[ fig : projective description ] the projective picture is drawn . through each point @xmath17 in the plane pass the four conics : two conics touching sides of the quadrilateral @xmath18 and two passing through its opposite vertices and @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the lines appearing in webs @xmath0 and @xmath11 can be described as lines passing through intersection of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( horizontal lines ) and through the intersection of @xmath21 and @xmath23 ( vertical lines ) .",
    "some triples of these conics have another joint intersections which correspond to points symmetric to @xmath17 in the axes ( figure  [ fig : four curves ] ) .",
    "so , in general we describe webs formed by the family of conics tangent to four fixed lines and passing though points of their intersection .",
    "w.  bhm in @xcite constructed a net consisting of lines touching a conic .",
    "quadrilaterals formed by lines of this net can be circumscribed around circles and points of intersection of these lines can be split into families lying on confocal conics .",
    "this construction was rediscovered and generalized by the author and a. bobenko in @xcite , where also it was noticed that bhm s net is a special case of the poncelet grid introduced and investigated by r.  schwarz @xcite , see also  @xcite for an additional discussion .",
    "the current constructions were inspired by the work of h.  edelsbrunner  @xcite , where he invented a new approach for designing smooth surfaces from a set of spheres .",
    "his method of connecting spheres by circumscribed hyperboloids is based on the following observation .",
    "let @xmath24 , @xmath25 satisfy @xmath26 . if we scale each elliptic apollonian circle of points @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath24 times and each hyperbolic apollonian circle @xmath25 with respect to its center , the obtained circles touch a fixed hyperbola with foci @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : edelsbrunner construction ] shows the case @xmath27 , when the hyperbola is equilateral .",
    "note that if @xmath28 , then scaled elliptic apollonian circles touch an ellipse with foci @xmath4 and  @xmath5 ( figure  [ fig : edelsbrunner construction ellipse ] ) .",
