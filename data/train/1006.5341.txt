    "the dynamical and statistical properties of systems with long - range interactions have recently attracted considerable attention ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite is considered as a prototype for some of the observed dynamical effects .",
    "the model describes the motion of @xmath0 fully coupled particles lying on a ring .",
    "the system presents a second order phase transition at the critical energy density @xmath7 from a low - energy phase , where the particles are clustered , to a high - energy gaseous phase where the particles are uniformly distributed on the ring .",
    "several different effects have been studied for this model , which have been then found to be generic for a large class of systems with long - range interactions , including self - gravitating systems , unscreened plasmas , two - dimensional hydrodynamics , etc ..    the question on which we concentrate in this paper is the behavior of the lyapunov exponents .",
    "this question has been investigated for a long time , already in some of the first papers on the hmf model . however , a general understanding of the chaotic properties of this model remains a challenge .",
    "since we will be mostly concerned with the @xmath2 behavior of the lyapunov exponents , this question has a relevance also for the vlasov equation , which is known to describe exactly the dynamics of the hmf model in this limit @xcite .",
    "let us briefly summarize the state of the art knowledge on the lyapunov exponents for the hmf model .",
    "the maximal lyapunov exponent ( mle ) increases with energy up to the critical energy density @xmath8 and then decreases for larger energies @xcite . in the whole high energy phase it drops to zero in the large @xmath0 limit as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "an analytical estimate of the mle , which takes into account microcanonical averages of suitable geometrical observables @xcite , was proposed by @xcite .",
    "a preliminary study of the scaling properties of the lyapunov spectra ( ls ) and of the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy was performed by @xcite .",
    "lyapunov instability of a modified hmf model , the so - called @xmath9-hmf , was first studied by @xcite and further analyzed by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 scaling has been shown to derive from a random matrix approximation @xcite .",
    "a supersymmetric approach @xcite suggests that the mle might vanish in the @xmath2 for all energies .",
    "a tendency of the model towards integrability when @xmath0 increases , meaning a vanishing mle , has been recently emphasized using a poincar return map approach @xcite .",
    "lyapunov exponents and the corresponding eigenmodes of the hmf model have been also recently studied in the vlasov @xmath2 limit @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a careful assessment of the scaling properties with @xmath0 of the mle , the ls and the ks entropy of the hmf model in various energy ranges and in conditions as close as possible to boltzmann - gibbs thermal equilibrium .",
    "with respect to previous studies , we have put more effort in establishing the equilibrium state , knowing that this is not easily reached due to the presence of quasi - stationary states @xcite . these latter",
    "are out  of  equilibrium states in which the system remains trapped for a time that increases with @xmath0 , slowing down indefinitely the relaxation to thermal equilibrium .",
    "an alternative approach , designed for fast detection of chaotic orbits , has been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "the method , which has been called generalized alignment index ( gali ) , allows one to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion using short - time numerical integrations .",
    "the gali method takes into account more than one deviation vector and measures the time evolution of the volume of the parallelepiped whose edges are these normalized vectors . in this paper",
    "we use the gali method to detect the fraction of chaotic orbits on a constant energy surface of the hmf model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ hmf_model ]",
    "we briefly introduce the hmf model and we discuss the main features of the boltzmann - gibbs statistical equilibrium state . in section  [ lyap_exp ]",
    "we recall how the ls is computed , in order to make the paper self - consistent .",
    "afterwards , in section  [ ls_ksres ] , we present the core results of this paper , by discussing the scaling with @xmath0 of the mle , the ls and the ks entropy . in section  [ gali_def ]",
    "we describe the gali chaos detection method and we test its efficiency by considering the hmf model with a small number of particles . in section",
    "[ gali_res ] we use the gali method for the estimation of the fraction of chaotic orbits in the model s phase space .",
    "our conclusions are finally summarized in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model @xcite describes a system of point masses moving on a ring and interacting through an infinite - range potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the coordinate of the @xmath12-th particle and @xmath13 its conjugate momentum .",
    "the system has only two constants of the motion : total energy @xmath14 and total momentum @xmath15 ( in the following we will always choose a zero total momentum without loosing generality ) .",
    "as the force vanishes when @xmath16 , the particles do not collide but smoothly cross each other .",
    "the _ order parameter _ of this model is the  magnetization \" vector @xmath17 and , after defining its phase @xmath18 and modulus @xmath19 , the equations of motion can be written as @xmath20    we solve numerically the equations of motion of the hmf model using an optimized fourth - order symplectic integrator @xcite with time step @xmath21 , which typically gives a relative energy fluctuation @xmath22 .",
    "the equilibrium statistical mechanics of the hmf model has been thoroughly studied ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the model has a second order phase transition at the critical energy density @xmath1 from a low - energy clustered phase where @xmath23 to a high - energy gaseous phase where @xmath24 .",
    "being this phase transition of second order , it can not be associated with a negative specific heat .",
    "the canonical and microcanonical ensemble give equivalent results @xcite .",
    "in the mean - field limit , @xmath2 , the dynamics of the hmf model is fully described by the single particle distribution function @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are the canonically conjugate eulerian coordinates of the single particle phase space . the single particle distribution function obeys a vlasov equation . among many stationary solutions of the vlasov equation ,",
    "a particular one is the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium distribution @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the inverse temperature and @xmath29 is the modified bessel function of order zero .",
    "this distribution is also stable with @xmath24 for @xmath30 and with @xmath23 for @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 can be interpreted as the inverse critical temperature of the second order phase transition , corresponding to the critical energy @xmath8 .    in order to reach the equilibrium distribution ( [ equilibrium ] ) on a reasonably short time scale , we have initialized positions with a gaussian distribution and we have computed the corresponding potential energy .",
    "we then determined the appropriate width of the gaussian distribution of momenta which gave the energy we wanted to achieve .",
    "this initial state was then evolved for a long time in order for the equilibrium distribution of eq .",
    "( [ equilibrium ] ) to be reproduced with a sufficient precision .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath33 particle case , we can reproduce the equilibrium temperature with a relative error of a few percent , which is compatible with the statistical error , expected to be of the order @xmath34 .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we briefly recall how the lyapunov spectrum of a @xmath35-dimensional flow is defined and computed @xcite , with reference to the hmf model .",
    "the @xmath35-dimensional phase - space coordinate is @xmath36 and the phase - space flow is generated by the system of autonomous first - order differential equations ( [ hme : eq_motion ] ) , which , using @xmath37 , can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the velocity field of the flow .",
    "the evolution equations for the deviation vector @xmath40 are @xmath41 where the @xmath42 jacobian matrix of the flow @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 with the @xmath45 jacobian @xmath46 given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 the @xmath45 identity matrix .",
    "the linear evolution equations ( [ var_eq ] ) are integrated with initial value @xmath49 , which physically represents the  small \" initial difference between two nearby orbits of eq .",
    "( [ dif_eq ] ) .",
    "numerically , this integration is performed in parallel with that of the orbit @xmath50 , since @xmath51 depends on it .",
    "one typically uses the same integration algorithm .    the maximal lyapunov exponent ( mle )",
    "is then defined as @xmath52 practically , since @xmath53 diverges exponentially , one has to renormalize it at regular time intervals .",
    "the computation of the mle is performed by averaging the renormalization factors .",
    "furthermore , when varying @xmath54 , one can obtain at most @xmath35 lyapunov exponents , which can be ordered in size @xmath55 and constitute the so - called lyapunov spectrum ( ls ) , with @xmath56 .    for hamiltonian flows ,",
    "the ls is endowed of the following symmetry property @xmath57    it is then enough to compute the first @xmath0 exponents . among them , for the hmf model , two are zero because of energy and momentum conservation . for a chaotic orbit all the others are typically positive",
    ".    however , because of the numerical instability which tends to align the deviation vector @xmath58 along the most expanding direction , one always obtains @xmath59 and has not access to the full ls .",
    "the trick to perform numerically the calculation of the full ls was found by @xcite and amounts to compute the hypervolume @xmath60 for @xmath61 deviation vectors @xmath62 .    then , the sum of the first @xmath61 lyapunov exponents @xmath63 is given by @xmath64",
    "a recent review about the lyapunov exponents and their calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "once the ls is known , the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy , which is the rate of information production , is given by @xmath65",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it has been proposed that in the whole high energy region @xmath66 the mle should vanish as @xmath3 .",
    "we want to show here that this scaling law is obeyed also by the full ls .    in panels",
    "a ) and c ) of fig .  [ le_sev ]",
    "we plot @xmath67 vs. @xmath68 , increasing @xmath0 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , for @xmath71 ( panel a ) and @xmath72 ( panel c ) .",
    "the total integration time was @xmath73 with time step @xmath21 , which provides a good convergence for the ls and a good accuracy for the energy conservation as well .",
    "the relative error in the determination of the mle is of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "we observe a general decreasing trend , showing a significant size dependence of the ls .",
    "this size dependence is almost completely eliminated when multiplying the ls by @xmath75 , as shown in panels b ) and d ) of the same figure .",
    "we observe a reasonably good  data collapse \" in the upper and lower parts of the spectrum .",
    "however , the insets in panels b ) and d ) show that the size dependence is not yet completely eliminated and remains of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "the insets reveal another interesting feature : while the convergence to an asymptotic ls is from above for the full ls at @xmath71 , at the energy @xmath72 it is from above only for the largest exponents and it is instead from below for the smaller exponents .      +      in fig .  [ max_01 ]",
    "we show the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath59 for @xmath71 , which is well fitted by the scaling law @xmath3 , confirming the result obtained by looking at the full ls .",
    "however , one has to reach much larger system sizes ( of the order of @xmath77 ) in order to check the scaling law , while the convergence to the asymptotic ls as @xmath0 increases is observed for much smaller system sizes ( up to @xmath70 ) .    other numerical experiments @xcite show that this scaling law is present also for energies above @xmath8 , but the quality of the data is never comparable with the one obtained here for @xmath71 .    while the scaling in the high energy range can be justified using a random matrix approximation @xcite and a theory using geometric properties of the phase - space @xcite , no theoretical approach exists for the explanation of the @xmath3 scaling at low energies .",
    "on the other hand , the only theoretical approach valid in this energy region @xcite would predict a strictly positive mle in the @xmath2 limit .        in fig .",
    "[ le_ab]a ) , we show the mle as a function of @xmath78 for various system sizes : @xmath79 .",
    "one observes a sharp increase of the mle around the energy @xmath5 .",
    "we ll come back to comment about this energy value in section  [ gali_res ] .",
    "the mle is peaked around the critical energy @xmath8 and shows , in this range of sizes , a weak size dependence for @xmath80 while for @xmath4 it systematically and monotonically decreases with system size . in panel b ) of the same figure , we check if the @xmath3 scaling found for the ls works also for the mle , by multiplying all mle by the factor @xmath75 .",
    "it turns out that this scaling does not work well for this relatively small number of particles .",
    "an  indermediate \" scaling with a factor @xmath81 looks slightly better in the high energy range , see fig .",
    "[ le_ab]c .    as a partial conclusion",
    ", we could state that the mle shows a size dependence over the whole energy range , but the @xmath3 scaling does not emerge easily from the data .",
    "this is at variance with the analysis above of the ls , for which this scaling was more evident .",
    "this is why we speak of  precocious \" scaling of the ls , meaning that the scaling is obtained for moderately large system sizes , while the scaling of the mle , as shown e.g. in fig .",
    "[ max_01 ] , needs much larger systems sizes to be numerically emphasized .",
    "since the ks entropy is the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents , inheriting some features of the ls , we expect that the scaling should be revealed more easily .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ks_abc ] , where we plot the ks entropy density @xmath82 vs. @xmath78 for several system sizes ( panel a ) and the same quantity multiplied either by @xmath75 ( panel b ) or by @xmath83 ( panel c ) . from panel",
    "a ) we observe that the ks entropy shows a general trend to decrease for all energies , as the system size increases .",
    "this is more evident than for the mle .",
    "panel b ) shows that this size dependence is almost completely eliminated for @xmath80 , hence the @xmath3 factor captures some essential feature of the scaling for all energies .",
    "however , in the @xmath4 range we still observe a significant size dependence .",
    "this latter is almost completely eliminated in panel c ) , where we multiply the ks entropy by @xmath83 , a phenomenological factor for which we have no theoretical justification .",
    "the low energy ks entropy scaling is however spoiled by this rescaling , showing that a global scaling , valid for all energies , does not seem to exist .",
    "it is also clear that the ks entropy peak is shifted at energies larger than @xmath8 , at variance with the behavior of the mle .",
    "the dependence of the mle on system size will be investigated in more detail in @xcite , going to number of particles of the order of @xmath84 .",
    "in this section we will briefly introduce the definition of the generalized alignment indices ( gali ) @xcite and we will comment on their physical meaning and their relation with lyapunov exponents .",
    "we will also present the application of the method to the hmf model with a limited number of particles , to show its efficiency for the fast detection of chaotic orbits .",
    "the gali index of order @xmath61 ( gali@xmath85 ) is determined through the evolution of @xmath86 initially linearly independent deviation vectors @xmath87 .",
    "its calculation is therefore strongly related to the one of the ls .",
    "the evolved deviation vectors @xmath88 are normalized at given time intervals in order to avoid overflows , but their directions are kept unchanged .",
    "then , according to @xcite , gali@xmath85 is defined to be the volume of the @xmath61-parallelogram having as edges the @xmath61 unit deviation vectors @xmath89 @xmath90 from this definition it is evident that if at least two of the deviation vectors become linearly dependent during dynamical evolution , the wedge product in eq .",
    "( [ gali:0 ] ) becomes zero and the gali@xmath85 vanishes .",
    "in the case of a chaotic orbit , all deviation vectors tend to become _ linearly dependent _ , aligning along the eigenvector corresponding to the maximal lyapunov exponent and gali@xmath91 tends exponentially to zero following the law @xcite @xmath92t},\\ ] ] where the @xmath67 are the lyapunov exponents ( or , better , their finite time approximations ) .    in the case of regular motion ,",
    "all deviation vectors move on the @xmath0-dimensional tangent space of a torus , on which the motion is quasiperiodic .",
    "thus , if one starts with @xmath93 deviation vectors , these will remain _ linearly independent _ on this tangent space , since there is no particular reason for them to become aligned . as a consequence ,",
    "gali@xmath91 remains in this case practically constant for all @xmath93 . on the other hand , for @xmath94",
    ", gali@xmath91 tends to zero , since some deviation vector will eventually become _",
    "linearly dependent_. according to @xcite , the gali indices associated with a quasiperiodic orbit lying on a @xmath95-dimensional torus ( with @xmath96 ) behave as follows @xmath97 when @xmath98 , gali@xmath85 remains constant for @xmath99 and decreases to zero as @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "an efficient way to calculate gali@xmath91 is by multiplying the singular values @xmath102 , computed using the singular value decomposition procedure of the matrix formed by the deviation vectors @xmath103 @xcite @xmath104    the method has been applied successfully to several hamiltonian systems like the fpu lattice @xcite and to coupled symplectic maps @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that it efficiently detects not only regular and chaotic motion but also the dimensionality of the tori on which the regular trajectory lies .",
    "we begin by analyzing the gali indices for systems with a few particles and we show examples of computations performed for the hmf model with @xmath105 ( integrable case ) and @xmath106",
    ".    for @xmath105 we have access to gali@xmath107 , since in this case the dimension of the phase space is @xmath108 . besides energy , also total momentum",

    "+      chaotic orbits of 3-dimensional hamiltonian systems generally have two positive lyapunov exponents . however , in the hmf model also total momentum is conserved and , therefore , only one positive exponent @xmath59 is present in the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , due to the symmetry of the lyapunov spectrum @xmath116 . therefore ,",
    "according to formula  ( [ gali:1 ] ) , the exponential decay in time of the gali indices is controlled only by @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gali : n=2_regular]c .",
    "the most important advantage of the gali method relies on the fact that , for chaotic orbits , the gali indices decay to zero exponentially fast .",
    "practically , an orbit can be labeled as chaotic when some gali@xmath85 ( where @xmath61 is conveniently chosen ) is found to be smaller than a given threshold .",
    "this often happens before the mle stabilizes on an average positive value , making the gali@xmath85 test more efficient in determining chaotic properties of an orbit than the measurement of the mle .",
    "we will give an explicit example of this property of the gali indices in the next section .",
    "in this section we will present the application of the gali method to the hmf model , as a tool to reveal the fraction of chaotic orbits on a constant energy surface with many degrees of freedom .",
    "the dependence of such a fraction on the number of degrees of freedom has been recently analyzed for fully or partially connected symplectic maps in @xcite , with an application also to the hmf model .    as we have discussed in the previous section",
    ", the gali method can be faster in revealing the chaotic or regular nature of a given orbit than the calculation of the mle . in order to perform a systematic analysis ,",
    "it is necessary to fix some criteria .",
    "the first important choice is the value of @xmath61 for the gali@xmath85 . in systems with many degrees of freedom we have access to high values of @xmath61 , but the calculation of the corresponding gali@xmath85 would be extremely heavy , since we would have to perform the singular value decomposition for large matrices . therefore , we are limited ourselves to small values of @xmath61 .",
    "we have avoided to use gali@xmath117 , since it has been shown in @xcite that , for some chaotic orbits of many degrees of freedom systems , the two largest lyapunov exponents can take very close values . in such chaotic cases ,",
    "the gali@xmath117 , instead of decreasing exponentially , stays constant , detecting a  false \" regular orbit . for the hmf model , in the energy range @xmath118 ,",
    "we have checked the different time evolution of gali@xmath119 and we have finally decided to concentrate our attention on the behavior of gali@xmath120 . fixing the total integration time to @xmath121 , we have labeled an orbit as regular if gali@xmath120 stays above @xmath122 over the whole time lapse .",
    "we instead label an orbit as chaotic if gali@xmath120 goes below @xmath123 within the total integration time .",
    "orbits not satisfying any of these two criteria are analyzed on a longer time span to assess their chaotic or regular nature ; however , in the simulations we have performed very few such cases happened .",
    "we have decided to fix the number of initial conditions to @xmath124 and we have performed simulations with increasing number of particles : @xmath125 .    in fig .",
    "[ chaos_fraction ] we show the fraction of chaotic orbits in @xmath126 as a function of @xmath78 .",

    "however , it is likely that the curve will reach an asymptotic limit as @xmath0 is increased ( currently not accessible for our computers ) , since the shift observed when passing from @xmath33 to @xmath127 ( a factor of 10 ) is of the same order as the one found when further multiplying @xmath0 by a factor of 5 .",
    "moreover , the fraction of chaotic orbits is below @xmath74 for @xmath132 and around @xmath133 for @xmath134 for all simulated system sizes , showing that a sharp transition from a _ weakly chaotic _ to a _ strongly chaotic _",

    "it s unclear why this happens ; a possible explanation is that , for this orbit , untrapped particles remain out of resonance for a longer time .",
    "this would imply less chaoticity because some particles remain far from the most chaotic part of the phase - space , which is around the chaotic layer of the separatrix .",
