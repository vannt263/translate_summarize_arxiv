    "geometric characteristics of random surfaces play a crucial role in areas such as geoscience , environmetrics , astrophysics , and medical imaging , just to mention a few examples .",
    "numerous real data have been modelled as gaussian random processes or fields and studying of their excursion sets is now a well developed subject .",
    "sojourn measures provide a classical approach to addressing various applied problems within this framework .",
    "there is a very rich literature on the topic , therefore below we cite only some key publications related to our approach .",
    "good introductory references to some applications can be found in @xcite .",
    "sojourn measures of stochastic processes were studied extensively in a number of contexts and explicit formulae for their statistical characteristics were obtained for various scenarios , see , for example , @xcite , results for gaussian stochastic processes with long range dependence in  @xcite , and also numerous references therein .",
    "unfortunately , one can not expect that the same will occur for the multidimensional situation . for random fields explicit formulae for the excursion distributions",
    "are rarely known , see @xcite .",
    "most published papers concern only first two moments of sojourn measures .",
    "however , it turned out that there are some interesting asymptotic results in this area .",
    "such results are usually the main tools for statistical applications .",
    "it is natural to consider the volume of excursion sets in a bounded observation window and to study its limit behaviour as the window size grows .",
    "some progress in this direction has been made in @xcite .",
    "the approach taken in the paper continues this line of investigations .",
    "the paper @xcite studied central limit theorems for the volumes of excursion sets of stationary quasi - associated random fields and suggested two open problems : the extension of the results to different classes of random fields and the investigation of asymptotics for strongly dependent structures .        in example",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] the first row shows two - dimensional excursion sets for realizations of two types of random fields ( from left to right ) : short - range dependent normal scale mixture model and long - range dependent cauchy model , consults section  [ sec9 ] .",
    "the excursion sets are shown in black colour . the q ",
    "q plots in the second row , which correspond to the models shown above , suggest that the limit law of the short - range dependent model is normal , while for the long - range dependent model the data are not normally distributed .",
    "additional details about figure  [ fig1 ] are provided in section  [ sec9].=1    the paper has three aims .",
    "one is to provide explicit , albeit asymptotic , formulae for the distribution of the volume of excursion sets of a class of strongly dependent random fields .",
    "the second one is to derive asymptotic results for heavy - tailed random fields . finally , the third aim is to generalize the previous findings to sojourn measures above moving levels and for cross - correlated scenarios",
    ".    there is , therefore , a need for models that are able to display strongly dependent heavy - tailed behaviour and yet are sufficiently simple to allow analysis . to obtain explicit results we detail the underlying structure of random fields .",
    "namely , a basic assumption of the analysis is that we examine functionals of vector gaussian random fields , in particular , student and fisher  snedecor random fields .",
    "consult @xcite on excursion sets of chi - square , student and fisher  snedecor random fields and their importance for image analysis and studies of brain function .",
    "other results on sojourn measures of chi - square random fields can be found in @xcite .",
    "minkowski functionals are widely used to characterise geometric properties of random fields , in particular in the analysis of cosmic microwave background radiation , see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the first minkowski functional of random fields and its expansions into multidimensional hermite polynomials , see some one - dimensional / discrete counterparts in @xcite . to have a complete account of results on asymptotic distributions of sojourn measures for functions of vector random fields ,",
    "we also prove corresponding theorems for weakly dependent scenarios .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in sections",
    "[ sec1][sec3 ] , we introduce the necessary background from the theory of random fields and briefly review some definitions and notation on the first minkowski functional , multidimensional hermite expansions , and student and fisher  snedecor random fields .",
    "we start sections  [ sec4 ] and [ sec6 ] with generalizations and corrections of some classical asymptotic results to arbitrary sets and vector fields . with this in hand , we continue sections  [ sec4 ] and  [ sec6 ] by new results for the first minkowski functional of student and fisher  snedecor random fields . in section  [ sec6 ] , we also show how to lift these results to sojourn measures above moving levels and for cross - correlated underlying vector fields .",
    "sections  [ proofs1 ] and  [ proofs2 ] provide the proofs of all theorems and lemmata in the article .",
    "simulation results on the limit distributions of areas of excursion sets for two types of images are given in section  [ sec9 ] .",
