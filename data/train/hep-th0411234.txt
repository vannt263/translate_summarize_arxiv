    "one of the most surprising results of the classification of all bps solutions to @xmath0 supergravity in five dimensions @xcite was the existence of a maximally supersymmetric gdel - type universe , with metric and u@xmath1 gauge field given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denote right - invariant one - forms on su@xmath4 , with euler angles @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is a real parameter responsible for the rotation of ( [ goedel ] ) .",
    "this solution solves the equations of motion following from the action @xmath7 - \\frac 1{24\\sqrt 3 \\pi g}\\int d^5 x\\ ,      \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } f_{\\mu\\nu } f_{\\alpha\\beta } a_{\\gamma}\\,.\\ ] ] like the original gdel universe @xcite , presented by kurt gdel in 1949 on occasion of albert einstein s 70th birthday , this solution is homogeneous : it has a nine - dimensional group of bosonic isometries h@xmath4 @xmath8 ( su@xmath9 @xmath10 u@xmath11 ) @xcite , where h@xmath4 denotes the heisenberg group with five generators .",
    "there are further common features of ( [ goedel ] ) and its four - dimensional cousin : the stress tensor of the maxwell field in ( [ goedel ] ) is that of pressureless dust with energy density proportional to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in addition , just like the original gdel universe , the solution ( [ goedel ] ) suffers from closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) ; the induced metric on hypersurfaces of constant @xmath13 and @xmath14 becomes lorentzian for @xmath15 .",
    "one can lift the five - dimensional gdel - type universe to @xmath16 supergravity .",
    "the solution is then just a product spacetime of ( [ goedel ] ) and a six - dimensional flat space @xmath17 .",
    "this configuration is highly supersymmetric , it preserves 20 supercharges @xcite .",
    "let us denote the coordinates of @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "dimensional reduction along say @xmath20 and subsequent t - duality along @xmath21 yields then the type iib pp - wave resulting from the penrose limit of ads@xmath22 @xmath10 s@xmath23 @xmath10 t@xmath24 @xcite . actually what one gets is a compactified pp - wave ,",
    "whose ctcs can be eliminated by going to the universal covering space .",
    "note that this is not possible for the solution ( [ goedel ] ) , which is already topologically trivial .    the appearance of ctcs creates of course several pathologies , for instance the possibility of time - travel or the fact that the cauchy problem in such spacetimes is always ill - defined , to mention only two of them .",
    "there is an ongoing research activity on gdel - type universes , with the general aim to shed light on the status of closed timelike curves in string theory .",
    "one would like to understand how string theory resolves the pathologies mentioned above , and if we should discard solutions like ( [ goedel ] ) , in spite of their high amount of supersymmetry .",
    "we will not discuss these issues here , and refer the reader to @xcite and references therein .",
    "apart from questions related to causality problems , the interest in gdel - type spacetimes is also motivated by holography : similar to de  sitter spaces , the gdel universe shows observer - dependent holographic screens @xcite , and there is evidence for a finite - dimensional hilbert space of a putative holographically dual theory .",
    "the gdel - type universe represents thus a supersymmetric laboratory for addressing conceptual puzzles of de  sitter holography @xcite . as we will see , of particular interest in these contexts are black holes immersed in gdel universes , which we will discuss in the remainder of this paper .",
    "gimon and hashimoto presented a solution that can be viewed as a kerr black hole ( with two equal rotation parameters @xmath25 ) embedded in the five - dimensional gdel universe ( [ goedel ] ) .",
    "the metric and gauge field are given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 represents the `` mass '' parameter of the solution .",
    "for @xmath29 , ( [ kerrgoedel ] ) reduces to the kerr black hole with equal rotation parameters . for @xmath30",
    ", we recover the gdel universe ( [ goedel ] ) . in",
    "what follows , we shall consider only the case @xmath31 , i.  e.  , the schwarzschild - gdel black hole .",
    "this has an event horizon at @xmath32 and an ergosphere at @xmath33 . for @xmath34 ( the velocity of light surface )",
    ", @xmath35 becomes lightlike . if @xmath36 , @xmath35 is timelike and ctcs appear .",
    "note that @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the maximal mass parameter ; for @xmath40 there is no horizon .",
    "notice also that for @xmath41 , the electromagnetic stress tensor can no more be written in perfect fluid form .",
    "the vector field @xmath42 is orthogonal to the natural time slicing determined by @xmath13 and becomes null on the horizon .",
    "@xmath43 is the future directed normal field and the lapse @xmath44 vanishes on the horizon but is infinite on @xmath45 .",
    "the horizon limit field @xmath46 is a timelike killing field for @xmath47 .",
    "note that the horizon angular velocity @xmath48 is nonzero because we have a black hole in a rotating universe rather than a rotating black hole that lives in a static background .",
    "it is tempting to associate to this black hole an entropy @xmath49 figure [ s ] shows @xmath50 as a function of the mass parameter @xmath28 .     as a function of @xmath28 . ]     as a function of @xmath28 . ]",
    "we see that , in contrast to black holes in asymptotically flat spaces or in ads , gdel black holes can not have an arbitrarily large entropy .",
    "@xmath50 becomes maximal for @xmath51 and decreases when @xmath28 is further increased .",
    "as the schwarzschild - gdel black hole represents a finite temperature excitation above the supersymmetric gdel ground state , it seems that there is an upper bound on the entropy of such excitations .",
    "similar to the case of de  sitter gravity , whose holographic dual was argued to have a finite number of states @xcite ( cf .",
    "also @xcite for a recent review ) , this seems to point towards a finite - dimensional hilbert space of the quantum description . in de",
    "sitter space , the entropy of a black hole is bounded from above by the entropy of the nariai solution , which is the largest black hole that can fit within the cosmological horizon .",
    "something similar happens for the gdel black hole , where the surface @xmath52 ( beyond which ctcs appear ) acts effectively like a box : the three - sphere that is tangent to the horizon develops timelike directions for @xmath36 , but timelike vectors can not be tangent to null surfaces , so there can be no horizons for @xmath36 .",
    "that s why there is an upper bound on the mass parameter and on the entropy of the gdel black hole .",
    "the horizon temperature is given in terms of the surface gravity @xmath53 , @xmath54 alternatively , it can be found by demanding smoothness of the euclidean section , which is obtained by the analytic continuation @xmath55 this implies that the euclidean time @xmath56 is identified modulo @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 quite surprisingly , it seems that the euclidean section is perfectly well - behaved in the whole range of @xmath14 , in spite of the pathologies encountered in its lorentzian counterpart .",
    "figure [ t ] shows @xmath60 as a function of @xmath28 . obviously there is a minimum temperature @xmath61 for @xmath62 ,",
    "so that the schwarzschild - gdel black hole can exist only above this temperature .",
    "this is reminiscent of schwarzschild - ads black holes , where a similar behaviour leads to the hawking - page phase transition .    in order to study more in detail the thermodynamics of the gdel black hole ,",
    "one needs a notion of mass and angular momentum in gdel universes .",
    "it is clear that @xmath28 and @xmath6 are not the thermodynamical parameters , because the partial derivative of the entropy ( [ entropy ] ) with respect to @xmath28 , keeping @xmath6 fixed , does not yield the correct inverse temperature .",
    "one possible way to define a mass is by means of the euclidean action .",
    "it is straightforward to show that in our case , the on - shell euclidean action reduces to the boundary term @xmath63 where @xmath64 with @xmath65 the outward pointing unit normal to the boundary @xmath66 , @xmath67 is the induced metric on the boundary , and @xmath68 denotes the trace of its extrinsic curvature . the last term is the gibbons - hawking boundary term necessary in order to have a well - defined variational principle .",
    "taking @xmath66 to be a surface of constant @xmath14 , one finds @xmath69 we were not able to regularize the divergence in @xmath70 for @xmath71 by subtracting a suitable background .",
    "the obvious background would be the solution with @xmath72 , i.  e.  , the supersymmetric gdel universe .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the gdel black hole does not approach the geometry with @xmath73 asymptotically , because @xmath74 the absence of a proper background to which the spacetime asymptotes is also one of the reasons that the usual abbott - deser construction to compute the mass and angular momentum does not work here .",
    "( another reason is the fact that the conserved charges calculated with the abbott - deser construction involve surface integrals at infinity , but , as the induced metric on such surfaces becomes lorentzian due to the presence of ctcs , these integrals would be imaginary ) . a possible way out could be to put the gdel black hole in a box @xmath75 , and to compute the stress - energy - momentum content of the bounded spacetime region @xmath76 using the brown - york formalism @xcite . in the case of the four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "this yields a first law in the form @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the local tolman temperature , blueshiftet from infinity to a finite radius @xmath79 .",
    "note the appearance of the additional term @xmath80 in the first law , which comes from the fact that one is considering a finite volume @xmath81 .",
    "one can now try to generalize this to the case of the schwarzschild - gdel black hole .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "alternatively , one can proceed as in @xcite to obtain a mass formula by integrating the killing identity @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a killing vector , on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath84 of constant @xmath13 from the black hole horizon @xmath85 to some @xmath75 . using @xmath86",
    "we obtain for the total mass @xmath87 contained in the region @xmath76 the smarr - like formula @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the angular momentum of the horizon , and @xmath90 denotes the stress tensor of the electromagnetic field . the last term in ( [ smarr ] ) represents the contribution of the gauge field to the energy in the region @xmath76 . evaluating ( [ smarr ] ) yields @xmath91\\ , .",
    "\\label{smarreval}\\ ] ]    further difficulties are related to the different notions of charge that appear in presence of chern - simons terms @xcite . to see this , consider the maxwell equations @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes an external source .",
    "integrating this on a spacelike hypersurface @xmath94 and using gauss law yields @xmath95 for the `` maxwell charge '' @xmath96 .",
    "( [ maxwcharge ] ) diverges for the gdel black hole , if @xmath97 is a surface of constant @xmath98 and @xmath71 .    in our case",
    ", we have a chern - simons term , and thus the maxwell equations are modified to @xmath99 with the chern - simons current @xmath100 proceeding as before yields the `` page charge '' @xmath101 which vanishes for the gdel black hole .",
    "these different notions of charge raise the question which one enters the first law of black hole mechanics .",
    "if we use the page charge , which takes into account only external sources , but not the contributions that come from the chern - simons current @xmath102 , the schwarzschild - gdel solution is not electrically charged .",
    "it might possess , however , a magnetic dipole moment @xmath103 .",
    "something similar happens for supertubes , to which the gdel spacetimes are closely related @xcite . for instance",
    "the type iia supertube carries no d2-brane charge , but it does have a d2-dipole moment @xcite .",
    "the question is thus if there appears a term @xmath104 in the first law of the gdel black hole ( @xmath105 denotes the magnetic field ) .",
    "as far as we are aware , up to now there are no known examples of black holes that have such a term in the first law . to determine @xmath103 is nontrivial ;",
    "the magnetic dipole moment can not be simply read off from the asymptotic behaviour of the electromagnetic field , because the solution is not asymptotically flat .    adopting the notion of page charge and assuming the absence of a magnetic dipole moment , the first law for the gdel black hole should have the form @xmath106 this can be integrated to get expressions for @xmath107 and @xmath108 . for dimensional reasons",
    "it is clear that @xmath107 and @xmath108 must have the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 are functions of @xmath112 only .",
    "the first law ( [ 1stlaw ] ) implies then @xmath113\\ , , \\\\ j & = & \\frac{\\pi j m^2}{32gx^2}(1 - 8x)^3\\left[\\frac 16 - 4x + 16c(1 - 8x)^3\\right]\\ , ,        \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath114 denoting an integration constant . notice that it is not possible to choose @xmath114 such that @xmath107 coincides with the total mass within the velocity of light surface @xmath52 , obtained by choosing @xmath115 in the smarr formula ( [ smarr ] ) , ( [ smarreval ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for no choice of @xmath114 does @xmath107 reduce to the total mass within the holographic bousso screen ( located at @xmath116 @xcite ) , or to the expression @xmath117 in ( [ smarr ] ) , that represents somehow the mass of the black hole ( being the total mass minus the contribution of the gauge field ) .",
    "it is easy to see that also @xmath118 for all values of @xmath114 .",
    "this means that the mass @xmath107 and the angular momentum @xmath108 that enter the first law must also have contributions from the electromagnetic field . requiring @xmath107 to reduce to its correct value @xmath119 in the limit @xmath120 fixes @xmath121 .",
    "we saw that black holes in gdel universes have some interesting properties , like the upper bound on the entropy , that points towards a finite - dimensional hilbert space of the quantum description , or the minimum temperature that is reminiscent of schwarzschild - ads black holes . for the latter",
    ", the minimum temperature leads to the hawking - page phase transition , but in the gdel case it is difficult to imagine something similar , because a phase transition can not occur in systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "perhaps a detailed analysis of the thermodynamical behaviour of gdel black holes can shed more light on these questions .",
    "as we saw , the formulation of a consistent thermodynamics is hindered by the difficulties that one encounters in defining conserved charges like mass and angular momentum .",
    "these problems are intimately related to the appearance of ctcs .",
    "one way to overcome them may be to embed the gdel black hole in an ads background and to study the thermodynamics of this `` schwarzschild - gdel - ads black hole '' .",
    "the motivation for this rests on the fact that a negative cosmological constant @xmath122 can act as a regulator for ctcs : in the gdel - ads solution found in @xcite , all ctcs disappear if the absolute value of @xmath122 is large enough compared to the gdel parameter @xmath6 @xcite . the difficulties in defining conserved charges and formulating a consistent thermodynamics , present in the case @xmath123 and discussed in detail above ,",
    "might then disappear .",
    "having determined the thermodynamic potentials , one can then study the limit when the cosmological constant approaches its critical value where ctcs show up , and see whether at that point phase transitions appear in the system .",
    "we leave an analysis of these issues for a future publication .",
