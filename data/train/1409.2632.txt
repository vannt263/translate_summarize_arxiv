    "superconducting tapes are often assembled in cable configurations in order to form conductors with the high current capacity .",
    "the performance of such cables strongly depends on the electromagnetic interaction of the tapes and it is therefore important to have simple and fast numerical tools able to evaluate that interaction . in a recent paper  @xcite we considered the problem of the critical state for superconducting thin tapes forming a polygonal cable .",
    "that model is based on the biot - savart law for current distributions with angular periodicity and on its transformation into a cauchy singular integral equation . as regards the ac losses",
    ", we found that two major factors greatly influence their value : ( a ) the number of tapes ( edges of the polygon ) and ( b ) the lateral gap between the tapes . in this paper , we utilize the same approach for a system of identical curved tapes , which we call for brevity an _ arc - polygonal cable_. this configuration describes more accurately the curvature of the tapes in conductor - on - round - core ( corc ) cables  @xcite and in other conductor concepts featuring curved tapes  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a set of @xmath0 equidistant arches , each of length @xmath1 , positioned on a circumference of radius @xmath2 and separated by a ( circular ) gap @xmath3 , as displayed in figure  [ fig : geometry ] .",
    "each tape carries the same sheet current density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the source point moving along the arc @xmath6 representing the cross - section of the conductor .",
    "is the null - field zone ( @xmath7 ) , where there is no penetration of the magnetic field.,width=302 ]    applying the biot - savart law for current distributions with angular periodicity , one can express the magnetic field in complex form as  @xcite @xmath8 defining @xmath9 the radius of the supporting circle is @xmath10 and the half angle of the tape sector is @xmath11 .",
    "one can rewrite  ( [ eq : biot - savart ] ) as a function of the polar angle posing @xmath12 @xmath13 if one considers in particular a field point on the arc , the integral must be calculated as principal value : defining @xmath14 , the magnetic field is @xmath15 by using the complex form of the magnetic field , the normal to the arc @xmath16 is given by the imaginary part of @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 d\\theta \\\\ & = \\frac{n}{2\\pi}{\\rm p.v.}\\int_{-\\alpha}^{\\alpha}j(\\theta)\\frac{1}{2}\\cot \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } n ( \\theta - \\phi ) \\right ] d \\theta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing the arc coordinates @xmath19 and @xmath20 , by simple substitution , since @xmath21 , we obtain the final expression @xmath22 where we have defined the green function for the arc - polygonal @xmath23 equation   tells us that the field @xmath24 is the _ finite _ hilbert transform of the current density @xmath25 .",
    "this expression is independent of @xmath0 , i.e. the perpendicular field on the arc @xmath26 does not depend on the number of arches composing the cable .",
    "assuming a number @xmath0 approaching infinity , one also has that @xmath2 approaches infinity , so that the cable becomes an infinite horizontal array ( the so - called @xmath27-array  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the distribution of the perpendicular field in a cable made of curved tapes does not depend on @xmath0 and it is equal to that of the perpendicular field of an @xmath27-array made of the same tapes and gaps .",
    "the circumstance @xmath28 relates to the case of a single tape with curvature of radius @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the remaining part of the circumference .",
    "the independence of the results on the number tapes @xmath0 had been already derived , although perhaps little emphasized , by mawatari  @xcite .",
    "he applies a method based on conformal mapping of exponential type that converts the curved tapes into an infinite @xmath27-array . in the transformed complex plane the magnetic field",
    "is then obtained by applying the usual biot - savart formula and the results are pulled back to the original cable plane by the inverse transform .",
    "in contrast , in our approach the magnetic field is obtained as an immediate application of the biot - savart formula for angular - periodic currents , see equation  , avoiding the detour of complex transforms , which one can consider as hindered in the hilbert kernel  .",
    "straightforward variable substitutions in the integral lead directly to the independence of the results on the number of tapes @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , as it will be shown later , the fact that @xmath29 may not be uniform , but depend on the position ( as a consequence of irregularities and difficulties of the manufacturing process ) can be easily implemented in the current approach .",
    "as a first application of formula   we consider the case of superconducting tapes in the critical state characterized by a constant @xmath29 . since the arc polygonal case coincides with the @xmath27-array case in this paragraph , for sake of practicality to the reader , we simply report the formulas that have been found in the past , using different methods  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath30 is the critical current for each tape and that the magnetic field penetrates each tape only in the lateral rims @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) . according to the critical state assumption , in those bands the current density is constant and assumes the critical value @xmath33 .",
    "in the central zone where the field is null ( n.f.z . ) the current density assumes a profile @xmath34 @xmath35 the unknown function @xmath34 satisfies the integral equation @xmath36 with the given term @xmath37 where we have defined the auxiliary function    @xmath38 } { \\sin \\left [ \\pi(y - x)/2 \\right]}.\\ ] ]    in this special case the integral equation can be solved analytically and we obtain @xmath39 which is the same result obtained for an @xmath27-array by mller  @xcite",
    ". the normal component of the magnetic field in the penetration band @xmath32 is obtained from   using   @xmath40 integrating   on the arc @xmath26 we find the total current transported by the tape @xmath41 as a function of the penetration @xmath42",
    "@xmath43     for a cable with polygonally arranged straight and curved tapes . for straight tapes ,",
    "the losses depend on the actual number of tapes ( in the figure 6 , 12 , 24 ) ; for curved tapes they do not and they are equal to those of an @xmath27-array.,width=302 ]    inverting   the penetration @xmath42 can be expressed as a function of the transport current ratio @xmath44 @xmath45 the ac losses ( in each tape of the cable ) can be computed resorting to norris s approach  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the period of the ac cycle .",
    "this integral appears not to be expressible by means of standard functions but is easily numerically evaluated .",
    "figure  [ fig : cfr_polygonal ] shows the ac losses as a function of the transport current for a cable made of @xmath0 polygonally arranged straight tapes ( @xmath0=6 , 12 , 24 ) and of curved tapes . in the latter case the losses are independent of @xmath0 and are equivalent to those of a tape in an @xmath27-array configuration .",
    "the following parameters were used : tape width=4  mm , gap=0.25 mm .",
    "the losses are plotted as a function of the reduced current @xmath48 and are normalized with respect to those of an isolated tape , computed with the well - known formula by norris  @xcite @xmath49.\\ ] ]",
    "the assumption of a uniform critical current density along the cross section is mostly motivated by the necessity of simple mathematical handling . however , this is not always the case : for example , hts coated conductors have often lower @xmath29 at the edges for reasons linked to the deposition of the superconducting layer in the manufacturing process  @xcite .",
    "this non - uniformity can importantly influence the tape s performance . in the following",
    "we extend our model to take the possibility of non - uniform @xmath29 into account .",
    "in particular , we shall consider two cases of non - uniform distribution of @xmath29 for which a reasonable mathematical treatment is still possible .",
    "first , we shall consider the case of a non - uniform lateral distribution of the critical current density @xmath50 , with a linear decrease in the lateral bands @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 so that the @xmath55 profile has a trapezoidal shape , as shown in figure  [ fig : casetta_plot_0 ]",
    ".    the critical current will therefore be @xmath56 . similarly to  , the current density is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the unknown function to be determined .",
    "the magnetic field is still given by   @xmath59    two cases need be considered , depending on the null field zone being internal or external to the interval @xmath60 .",
    "case @xmath61 : the magnetic field is null in @xmath62 and one has @xmath63 or @xmath64 where the known term is @xmath65,\\ ] ] where we have defined the auxiliary function @xmath66\\ ] ] ( @xmath67 is the dilogarithm function and @xmath68 is the same as in  ) .",
    "case @xmath69 : in a completely similar way one will have again  , but with the known term given by @xmath70.\\ ] ] equation   is singular of cauchy type ( principal value ) , as it can be seen developing the cotangent in series @xmath71 a direct solution ( of numerical type ) is very problematic and it is convenient to extract the singularity from the integral .",
    "setting @xmath72 we can write @xmath73 one can immediately note that @xmath74 .",
    "equation   therefore becomes @xmath75 where one has defined the non - singular kernel @xmath76 in fact , in virtue of the development of the cotangent , one has @xmath77 .",
    "equation   can now be transformed into a non - singular equivalent one ( see appendix for details ) , more specifically into a fredholm equation of the second type , which can be easily solved with the usual numerical techniques dedicated to that purpose .",
    "@xmath78 once   is solved , the distribution of current density along the whole width of the tape is known .",
    "one can therefore calculate the total current and the magnetic field .",
    "the ac losses can be obtained by adapting the norris method to the current case , i.e. @xmath79 finally , inverting the order of integration , one obtains @xmath80 one can easily verify that in the case of constant @xmath29 in @xmath32 one obtains again  .",
    "let us finally consider the more general case where the distribution of the critical current density @xmath55 does not drop to zero at the edges , but to a finite value @xmath81 , as displayed in figure  [ fig : casetta_plot ] .",
    "we can treat this case as a weighted superposition of the two previous two cases  the sum of a constant distribution and a trapezoidal distribution going to zero @xmath82 with @xmath83 given by  .",
    "this superposition is possible because the kernel of the respective integral equations is the same  .",
    "for this reason the related integral equation will be @xmath84 where @xmath85 is given by   and @xmath86 by   and  . by the linearity of this equation , for any chosen value of the penetration @xmath42",
    ", the solution will be given by the same superposition of the solutions of the previous cases @xmath87 where @xmath34 is given by   and @xmath58 is the solution of  .",
    "the current density will be given by @xmath88 where @xmath29 is a multiplicative constant determined by the request of the actual value of the critical current of the tape @xmath89 .",
    "the transported current is @xmath90 and finally we obtain the current ratio @xmath48 as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "once the current density is known , the normal magnetic field is given by   and the ac losses by an integral as in  .",
    "comparison of the current density profiles of tapes characterized by different values of @xmath91 .",
    "the transport and critical currents are 80 and 100  a in all cases ( @xmath92).,width=8 ]    comparison of the transport ac losses of tapes characterized by different values of @xmath91 .",
    "the losses are normalized with respect to those of a norris - like strip carrying the same current ratio @xmath44.,width=8 ]    as an application , in figure  [ fig : profiles ] we compare the current density profiles of tapes with the same geometrical properties ( @xmath93=2 mm , @xmath94=1.4 mm and @xmath95=0.25 mm ) , the same critical and operational current ( 100 and 80 a , respectively ) , but different trapezoidal distributions of the critical current density : @xmath81=0 , 0.2,0.4 , 0.6 , 1 , the latter case corresponding to a uniform current distribution .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the effect of having a non - uniform distribution is to move the region with maximum current toward the center .",
    "another consequence of the non - uniform distribution of @xmath50 is the fact that the losses are higher .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : losses ] , where the losses are plotted as a function of the current ratio @xmath44 . in all cases ,",
    "the ac losses are normalized to those of a norris strip characterized by the same given @xmath30 and current ratio @xmath44 .",
    "the more pronounced the trapezoidal distribution is ( i.e. the lower @xmath81 ) , the higher the losses .",
    "tapes with @xmath81=0.4 have about three times the losses of tapes characterized by a uniform current density distribution .",
    "in this paper we carried out the critical state solution of curved thin tapes arranged around a cylindrical former . with our method , which avoid complex conformal mapping techniques , we immediately derived the fact that the electromagnetic behavior of this configuration is the same as that of an infinite @xmath27-array of straight tapes .",
    "as such , it does not depend on the number of tapes , but only on the tape width and on the gap between the tapes .",
    "the losses of a cable composed of curved tapes are much lower than those of a polygonal configuration , and can be seen as the lowest limit .",
    "we subsequently extended our model to include spatial variations of the critical current density , a situation that for example occurs often in hts coated conductors .",
    "we calculated the current profiles for several spatial distributions of the critical current , and evaluated the impact of such non - uniformity on the ac losses of the cable .",
    "besides the specific cases considered in this paper , this modeling approach can be extended to other situations of practical interest , characterized by the presence of periodic assemblies of current - carrying tapes .",
    "the cauchy type singular equation @xmath96 where the kernel @xmath97 is not singular , can be rewritten as @xmath98 where we posed @xmath99 the solution of   bounded at both extremes is @xmath100 with the supplementary constraint that @xmath101 by   this request can be satisfied , for instance , if the given term @xmath102 is an odd function and if the kernel @xmath97 transforms even functions in odd functions .",
    "if this is the case , the solution @xmath103 turns out to be an even function . applying this solution",
    "to   we obtain @xmath104 changing the integration order in the second term we have @xmath105 so that , defining @xmath106 equation   becomes @xmath107 the singular integral equation    with the restrictions above  has the same solution @xmath103 as the non - singular integral equation  .",
    "the main advantage of this transformation is that the calculation of the principal value present in the integral equation is shifted to the calculation of a new given term and of a new kernel .",
    "a second advantage is that   is a fredholm integral equation of second type , a well posed integral equation for which many solving numerical routines exist ( i.e. nystrm methods ) .",
