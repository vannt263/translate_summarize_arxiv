    "environment - assisted transport occurs in ( statically ) disordered systems in which transport has been arrested due to anderson localization ; through interactions with a fluctuating environment ( dynamic disorder ) , the transport efficiency of the quantum walker may be enhanced .",

    "this enhancement in transport efficiency for mode 5 corresponds to a reduction in the probability for the walker to stay at origin sites ( @xmath36 ) , where the quantum walker is localized , as shown by the strong static disorder cut in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour](g ) . in summary , a quantum walker confined to modes 7 and 8 by anderson localization is released through interaction with a noisy environment , increasing the quantum walker s transport efficiency to the outer modes .    to determine whether a transport optimum that is similar to the prediction for continuous - time qws could be observed in a dt qw , we performed computer simulations of a pnp with 15 time steps .",
    "the data indicate that a transport optimum is indeed observable in systems such as the pnp ( see supplemental information for more information ) .",
