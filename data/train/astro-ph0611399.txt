    "the fast x - ray transient source xte j1901 + 014 was discovered [ 4 ] by the all - sky monitor asm on board the rxte observatory during the powerful outburst on april 6 , 2002 lasted from 3 min to 3.15 hours and reached the peak flux @xmath10.9 crab in the 1.5 - 12 kev energy band ( fig.1 , right panel ) .",
    "the source position was determined as ra = 19@xmath2 01@xmath3 45@xmath4.95 , dec = + 1 2415.7(j2000 ; 3uncertainty ) .",
    "the analysis of the archival asm data [ 5 ] revealed a previous outburst from the same position on june 21 , 1997 .",
    "this outburst was longer than 6 min and shorter than 8 hr , with a peak flux of @xmath10.4 crab ( fig . 1 , left panel ) .",
    "the obtained information about xte j1901 + 014 was not enough to make any confident conclusions about its nature , but it was noted that the time scale of this flare is similar to those of such events observed from the black hole binary v4641 sgr .    in this report",
    "we briefly present results of observations of xtej1901 + 014 with the integral and rxte observatories .",
    "more detail analysis will be presented separately ( see [ 2 ] ) .",
    "during the outburst in july 1997 the source flux in the 1.5 - 3 kev energy band did not exceed the background level whereas in the harder energy bands , 3 - 5 kev and 5 - 12 kev , it reached @xmath10.13 crab and @xmath10.7 crab , respectively . during the outburst in april 2002",
    "the peak fluxes in these three bands were detected at the levels of @xmath10.8 , @xmath11.1 and @xmath11.2 crab , respectively .",
    "thus both observed outbursts were hard .",
    "we analysed rxte / asm archive data from junuary , 1996 to july , 2006 and could not find other such powerful outbursts from the source .",
    "xtej1901 + 014 was detected in the quiescent state ( outside of outbursts ) by both the spectrometer rxte / pca in september , 1998 and april , 2002 , with the full exposure @xmath11650 s and an average 3 - 100 kev flux of @xmath12.8 mcrab ( is was the same in different years ) and the detector integral / isgri in 2003 - 2004 see above with an average flux of @xmath12.7 mcrab in the 17 - 100 kev energy band .",
    "some aperiodic variability of the source flux was detected in all rxte observations .",
    "we found a number of small flares with a duration of 40 - 60 s and a maximal flux of @xmath16 - 8 mcrab .",
    "the origin of such variability is most likely connected with a nonsteady accretion .",
    "analysis of the rosat all - sky survey source catalogue , has shown that the source 1rxs j190141.0 + 012618 is located in the rxte / asm error box ( 3 ) of xte j1901 + 014 . during the pointed rosat / hri observation performed on october 3 , 1994 , the source was also detected , its position was refined and the source was renamed as 1rxh j190140.1 + 012630 [ 7 ] .    using the integral / isgri data we improved an accuracy of the xte j1901 + 014 localization to @xmath11.2 . as it clearly seen from fig.2",
    "the rosat source 1rxh j190140.1 + 012630 confidently the distance between positions of xte j1901 + 014 and 1rxh j190140.1 + 012630 is about 0.3 ) falls into the integral / isgri error box for xtej1901 + 014 , that points that xte j1901 + 014 and 1rxh j190140.1 +",
    "012630 are the same source .",
    "we have only very poor information of the source spectral evolution during the outbursts ( see below ) , but can precisely reproduce its spectrum in the quiescent state .      to obtain the broadband spectrum of the source in the quiescent state we used rxte / pca data in the 3 - 20 kev energy band and integral / isgri data in the hard energy band ( @xmath520 kev ) analysis .",
    "it is important to note , that the pca / rxte observations were performed in 1998 , 2002 and the isgri / integral ones - in 2003 - 2004 .",
    "thus our spectral reconstruction is correct in the suggestion that the spectrum shape of the source does not change during this time interval .",
    "the broadband ( 3 - 100 kev ) spectrum of xtej1901 + 014 was approximated by a simple power law model with the interstellar absorption which value was fixed at n@xmath6 = @xmath7 atom/@xmath8 that is typical for this direction to the sky ( it was evaluated from the n@xmath6 map ) . the best - fit photon index is @xmath9=2.15 @xmath10 0.03 ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    we analysed small short flares registered by rxte / pca from the source ( see above ) and found that the source spectral shape did not changed during the flares .",
    "xtej1901 + 014 is located near the galactic plane ( l = 35.38 deg , b = -1.62 deg ) , thus the galactic ridge emission could strongly affect the result of spectral measurements with rxte / pca [ 3 ] . in this report the spectrum and lightcurves of xtej1901 + 014 were obtained taking into account this contamination . in order to estimate the galactic ridge emission intensity we used the data obtaned during pointing observations of nearby transient sources performed during their `` turned off '' state .",
    "in particular we used pointing data of gs 1843 - 02 ( l @xmath1131 deg , b @xmath11 - 0.5 deg ) observations , that is the nearest transient x - ray pulsar to obtain the galactic ridge spectrum at its position for xtej1901 + 014 .",
    "the analysis of this data allows us to obtain the galactic ridge spectrum near gs 1843 - 02 . due to the nature of the galactic ridge emission",
    "its spectrum has the same form in different regions of the sky with -5 deg @xmath12 b @xmath12 + 5 deg [ 3 ] .",
    "therefore we can just renormalize this spectrum ( using the scan data ) , to get the galactic ridge spectrum at xtej1901 + 014 position .",
    "the importance of accounting the galactic ridge emission is demonstrated by fig.4 , where the total pca / rxte spectrum is shown along with the galactic ridge and source true spectra .",
    "however using two energy bands of rxte / asm ( 3 - 5 and 5 - 12 kev ) it is possible to roughly estimate evolution of the photon index during the outbursts . according to [ 6 ]",
    "the photon index @xmath13 can be expressed as : @xmath14 where r - the relation between count rates in the 3 - 5 kev and 5 - 12 kev energy bands .",
    "note that this equation was obtained for sources with powerlaw spectra .    for the outburst in june , 1997",
    ", we found that @xmath13 was not changed significantly ; for the outburst in april , 2002 - it changed from 2.4 + /-",
    "0.1 to 1.4 + /-",
    "* the broadband spectrum of xtej1901 + 014 in the quiescent state was obtained and investigated for the first time .",
    "it can be approximated by a simple power law model with the photon index of @xmath12.15 without any high energy exponential cutoff . *",
    "the powerful outbursts of the source in 1997 and 2002 are not the 1st type x - ray bursts because they become harder with time , resembling to the well - known outburst of v4641sgr or outbursts from saxj1818.6 - 1703 [ 1 ] . *",
    "a number of small short flares were detected from the source during pointed rxte / pca observations . *",
    "the accuracy of the xtej1901 + 014 localization was improved from 3to @xmath11.2that strengthens the association of the source with the rosat soft source 1rxh j190140.1 + 012630 .",
    "summarizing all the above we can suppose that xtej1901 + 014 belongs to the class of fast x - ray transient sources , but for the final answer on its origin , more observations at different wavelengths are necessary .",
