    "in 1985 , hahm and kulsrud published a seminal paper @xcite on a basic problem of forced magnetic reconnection , the so - called `` taylor problem '' ( after the physicist j.b .",
    "taylor who first proposed it ) . in this model of forced reconnection ,",
    "a tearing - stable slab plasma equilibrium is subject to a small - amplitude boundary perturbation that drives magnetic reconnection . adopting a resistive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) description of the plasma , hahm and",
    "kulsrud showed that after an initial phase in which a current sheet builds up , the forced reconnection process evolves according to a linear resistive phase and then a nonlinear rutherford regime @xcite .    successively ,",
    "in 1992 , wang and bhattacharjee @xcite showed that under certain conditions the reconnection process in the taylor model passes into the nonlinear regime according to a sweet - parker - like evolution @xcite instead of a rutherford one .",
    "these two scenarios have been successively investigated for the case of a visco - resistive mhd plasma by fitzpatrick @xcite . in particular",
    ", he determined an expression for the threshold perturbation amplitude required to trigger a sweet - parker - like evolution .",
    "since the pioneer work by hahm and kulsrud , the taylor problem has not been free from controversies @xcite and has continued to be of great interest in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "in fact , taylor s model has considerable implications for laboratory plasmas ( such as those in tokamaks , in which resonant magnetic perturbations can lead to magnetic reconnection ) as well as astrophysical plasmas ( such as those characterizing the solar corona , in which magnetic reconnection can be forced by the motion of the photospheric footpoints ) .",
    "however , despite the numerous works related to this problem , the nonlinear possible scenarios of the magnetohydrodynamical taylor model have not changed from those found by hahm and kulsrud @xcite , wang and bhattacharjee @xcite , and fitzpatrick @xcite .    in this article , extending our preliminary results @xcite , we give evidence that a different nonlinear scenario is possible . we show that under certain conditions , after the initial phase in which a very elongated current sheet forms at the resonant surface , there is a sudden transition to a fast reconnection regime characterized by the disruption of the current sheet due to the development of plasmoids . in spite of",
    "the fact that it is known from quite a long time that elongated reconnecting current sheets can become unstable to the formation of plasmoids @xcite , this possibility has not been taken into account in the theory of forced magnetic reconnection in taylor s model .",
    "in other contexts , instead , there has been a growing interest in the investigation of the link between plasmoid formation and fast reconnection @xcite .    here , we extend previous analysis of the taylor problem considering also the plasmoid - unstable regime .",
    "we discuss all the scenarios of the collisional magnetohydrodynamical taylor model within a unified framework and we examine the conditions under which these scenarios occur . both resistivity and viscosity are taken into account , since both may play an important role in laboratory as well as in astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "we perform both analytical and numerical calculations , showing that the development of plasmoids causes the onset of a fast reconnection regime .",
    "therefore , the present analysis is important to understand the evolution of the collisional reconnection process from the current sheet formation to fast magnetic energy conversion rates .",
    "we consider a plasma described by the two - dimensional ( 2d ) reduced mhd model @xcite . within this description the magnetic and velocity fields",
    "can be expressed in terms of flux and stream functions as @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the unit vector along the ignorable coordinate .",
    "the flux and stream functions are governed by the resistive ohm s law @xmath3 and the vorticity equation @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the electric current density and @xmath6 is the plasma vorticity , both in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "the kinematic viscosity can be recognized as @xmath8 , whereas @xmath9 stands for the electrical resistivity .",
    "the term @xmath10 represents an externally applied electric field , which is required to maintain the equilibrium magnetic field in the presence of a small but finite electrical resistivity .",
    "this system of equations is dimensionless , with the lengths normalized to a convenient scale length @xmath11 , the magnetic field to a convenient scale field strength @xmath12 , and the time to the alfvn time @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the alfvn speed based on @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the normalized resistivity corresponds to the inverse of the lundquist number @xmath15 , being @xmath16 the magnetic diffusivity , while the normalized kinematic viscosity is linked to the magnetic prandtl number by means of the relation @xmath17 .",
    "we consider a slab plasma which is periodic in the @xmath18 direction and is bounded by perfectly conducting walls at @xmath19 ( note that the normalizing length @xmath11 is chosen to be the half distance between the walls ) .",
    "moreover , we consider a tearing - stable equilibrium given by @xmath20 this gives also that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ( the normalizing field strength @xmath12 is chosen to be the in - plane equilibrium magnetic field at @xmath24 ) .",
    "now we suppose that the conducting walls are subject to a sudden displacement @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 @xcite . the perturbation time scale @xmath29 is assumed to be significantly larger than the alfvn time @xmath30 (",
    "thus the plasma can be considered in magnetostatic equilibrium everywhere except near the resonant surface at @xmath31 ) but much shorter than any characteristic reconnection time scale .",
    "furthermore , the displacement is assumed to be small compared to the half distance between the walls , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , the boundary conditions at the flux conserving walls can be written as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 since @xmath38 .",
    "for this reason we have also that @xmath39 .    in taylor s problem , as well as in tearing mode theory , it is convenient to divide the spatial domain into two regions : an `` outer region '' , where non - ideal effects and plasma inertia can be neglected , and a thin `` inner region '' centered on the resonant surface at @xmath31 , where resistivity , viscosity , and plasma inertia can be important . hence , in the outer region the vorticity equation reduces to @xmath40 since the boundary perturbation is relatively small , we can write @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the perturbation in the form @xmath43 . therefore , the linear approximation of eq .",

    "we will see in the following that in such cases the plasmoid instability may resolve this issue .",

    "the fragmentation of the reconnecting current sheet occurs when both conditions ( [ sp_condition_2 ] ) and ( [ plasmoid_condition_3 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "hence , the plasmoid phase is triggered by the external perturbation when @xmath230 since @xmath231 and @xmath232 , there exists a critical wave number @xmath233 below which the reconnecting current sheet always leads to the plasmoid formation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . furthermore , since @xmath233 increases for decreasing values of @xmath9 and @xmath8 , the disruption of the current sheet is unavoidable in plasmas with very small resistivity and viscosity .",

    "@xcite , who explained the fast reconnection rates observed in strongly laser - driven systems as the result of substantial upstream flux - pileup effects .    note that the disruption of the current sheet increases significantly the reconnection rate with respect to the hypothetical case of an elongated current sheet that would remain stable even for very small values of resistivity and viscosity .",
    "indeed , eq . ( [ rec_rate_plasmoids_at_x_3 ] ) shows us that the reconnection rate in the visco - resistive plasmoid phase depends on the magnetic prandtl number @xmath241 but not on the lundquist number @xmath244 , leading to the possibility of attaining fast magnetic reconnection even at very large lundquist numbers .",
    "it is important to highlight that most of the presented theory applies to general reconnecting current sheets , irrespective of being generated by a strong external forcing ( large @xmath245 ) or a spontaneous process in a strongly unstable equilibrium ( large @xmath92 ) , or a combination of both .",
    "indeed , the condition ( [ plasmoid_condition_1 ] ) for the plasmoid instability of a reconnecting current sheet has general validity and extends the previously proposed conditions @xcite to arbitrary ratios @xmath246 .",
    "similarly , also the relation ( [ rec_rate_plasmoids_at_x_2 ] ) for the reconnection rate in the plasmoid - dominated regime is valid for both spontaneous and forced reconnection . in particular",

    "[ sec2 ] . to this aim",
    ", we employ a numerical code that splits all the fields into the time - independent equilibrium and an evolving perturbation , which is advanced in time according to a third order adams - bashforth algorithm .",
    "a compact finite difference algorithm is adopted to compute the spatial operations in the @xmath69 direction ( on a non - equispaced grid ) , while a pseudospectral method is used for the periodic direction .",
    "we adopt a space discretization of 512@xmath2488192 grid points , so that the minimum step size in the @xmath69 direction is @xmath249 , whereas in the @xmath18 direction we have @xmath250 .    in the following , we consider the results of simulations with @xmath251 ( i.e. , @xmath252 ) , @xmath253 and different values of @xmath254 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 .",
    "the choice of the parameters is such to fall within the three scenarios presented in the previous section .",
    "indeed , for a fixed perturbation wave number @xmath146 , the possible evolutions of the system can be organized in a three - dimensional `` phase diagram '' with @xmath254 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 on the three axis ( a four - dimensional `` phase diagram '' is needed to retain also the @xmath146 dependence ) .",

    "the typical evolution of the reconnection rate when the perturbation amplitude satisfies condition ( [ rutherford_condition_2 ] ) ( but is not so small as to prevent the system from entering into the nonlinear regime ) is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] . in this case",
    "the inertial phase lasts until the non - constant-@xmath90 island width becomes comparable to the linear layer width , at @xmath262 ( well before @xmath263 ) .",

    "is shown in fig . [ fig6](a ) . however , as the reconnecting current sheet gradually thins , the plasmoid instability sets in at @xmath264 .",
    "a sudden increase of the reconnection rate occurs when the first nonlinear plasmoids reach the width of the current sheet , which begins to break up at @xmath265 .",
    "then , after @xmath266 , when the plasmoid chain is well developed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ) , the reconnection rate seems to fluctuate around a constant mean value , as expected on the basis of previous numerical simulations of plasmoid - dominated reconnection @xcite .",
    "the growth of the plasmoids is so fast that they start to merge before being ejected in the downstream region , and the simulation is stopped at @xmath267 , when the adopted truncated fourier expansion can no longer resolve the large gradients in the @xmath18 direction that are due to the coalescence of the plasmoids in this stage of the reconnection process .",
    "although in our simulations we are not able to achieve a long statistical steady - state of the plasmoid phase , it is interesting to try to look at the dependence on the magnetic prandtl number of the reconnection rate in this phase . performing numerical simulations by varying @xmath268",

    "the reconnection rate for the simulation with @xmath271 deviates more from the theoretical predictions mainly because of the numerical dissipation that adds up to the physical dissipation and that is more significant when the physical viscosity is lower .",

    "\\iii ) our scenario : if the perturbation is such that @xmath274 and @xmath275 , after the linear inertial phase and an initial nonlinear evolution with a gradually evolving current sheet , the reconnection suddenly enters into a fast plasmoid phase .",
    "note that the realization of a sweet - parker sheet before the onset of the plasmoid phase is not mandatory , since in systems with extremely large lundquist numbers the plasmoid instability may be triggered prior to the attainment of such current sheet @xcite    the plasmoid formation plays a key role in allowing fast magnetic reconnection by making the reconnection rate independent of the lundquist number , which is known to be extremely large in many astrophysical and laboratory plasmas . while for the case of negligible viscosity",
    "the reconnection rate is also independent of the magnetic prandtl number , we have shown that when viscosity is not negligible @xmath276 .",
    "therefore , the reconnection rate in the visco - resistive plasmoid phase decreases as the magnetic prandtl number increases .",
    "the reconnection rate depends also on the perturbation amplitude , whose effect is to increase the magnetic field upstream of the reconnection region .",
    "it is important to highlight that there exists a critical perturbation wave number @xmath233 below which the evolution of the system always leads to the plasmoid phase .",
    "since @xmath233 increases for decreasing values of the plasma resistivity and viscosity , the development of stable elongated current sheets is not attainable in many situations of interest in astrophysical and laboratory fusion plasmas . therefore , also modest perturbation amplitudes may lead to plasmoid - dominated reconnection in plasmas characterized by very small resistivity and viscosity .",
