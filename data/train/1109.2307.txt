    "bcs  bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover has been an interesting research subject since 1980 s @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of bcs - bec crossover in ultracold atomic fermi gases @xcite , with the help of feshbach resonances , has given it a strong boost @xcite over the past several years .",
    "when the pairing interaction is tuned from weak to strong in a two component fermi gas , the superfluid behavior evolves continuously from the type of bcs to that of bec @xcite .",
    "in such a fundamentally fermionic system , superfluidity mainly concerns pairing , namely , interactions in the particle - particle channel . in contrast , the particle - hole channel mainly causes a chemical potential shift , and is often neglected @xcite .",
    "for example , in a conventional superconductor , the chemical potential below and above @xmath2 are essentially the same , and thus its dependence on the temperature and the interaction strength has been completely neglected in the weak coupling bcs theory for normal metal superconductors . on the other hand , gorkov and melik - barkhudarov ( gmb ) @xcite considered the lowest order correction from the particle - hole channel , ( which has been referred to as induced interaction in the literature ) , and found that both @xmath2 and zero temperature gap @xmath1 are suppressed by a _ big _",
    "factor of @xmath5 .",
    "berk and schrieffer @xcite also studied a similar effect in the form of ferromagnetic spin correlations in superconductors . despite the big size of the gmb correction , the effect of the particle - hole channel has been largely overlooked in the theoretical study of bcs - bec crossover , until it has become realistic to achieve such crossover experimentally in atomic fermi gases .",
    "heiselberg and coworkers @xcite considered the effect of the lowest order induced interaction in dilute fermi gases and generalized it to the case of multispecies of fermions as well as the possibility of exchange of bosons .",
    "@xcite considered the lowest order induced interactions in optical lattices . within the _ mean - field _ treatment and _ without _ including the excitation gap in the particle and hole propagators , these authors found the same effective overall interaction at zero @xmath0 and at @xmath2 and hence an unaffected mean - field ratio @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite considered the lowest order induced interactions in a three - component fermi gas .",
    "it has become clear that including only the perturbative lowest order induced interaction is _ not _ appropriate away from the weak coupling bcs regime .",
    "yin and coworkers @xcite went beyond the lowest order and considered the induced interactions from all particle - hole ladder diagrams , i.e. , the entire particle - hole @xmath0-matrix .",
    "however , in all the above works , only the _ bare _ particle - hole susceptibility @xmath7 was considered , and it was averaged on - shell and only on the fermi surface , with equal momenta for the particle and the hole propagators .",
    "no self - energy feedback was included .",
    "therefore , there was necessarily no pseudogap in the fermion excitation spectrum at @xmath2 .",
    "this is basically equivalent to replacing the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath7 by an essentially temperature independent constant , leading to a simple downshift in the pairing interaction .    as the gap and",
    "@xmath2 increase with interaction strength , it can naturally be expected that the contribution from the particle - hole channel , or the induced interaction , will acquire a significant temperature dependence .",
    "more importantly , _ the presence of the ( pseudo)gap serves to suppress the particle - hole fluctuations _ ( which tend to break pairing ) . in other words , neglecting the feedback of the gap related self energy in the particle - hole susceptibility is expected to cause an over - estimate of the particle - hole channel contributions .",
    "therefore , a proper treatment should include the gap effect in the particle - hole susceptibility .",
    "in addition , the lowest order treatment is no longer appropriate away from the weak coupling regime .",
    "furthermore , it has now been established that as the pairing interaction increases , pseudogap develops naturally @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence for its existence comes from high @xmath2 superconductors @xcite as well as atomic fermi gases @xcite .",
    "therefore , a theory with proper treatment of the pseudogap effect is necessary in order to arrive at results that can be _ quantitatively _ compared with experiment . for the same reason , the effect of the particle - hole channel needs also to be studied within such a theory .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the particle - hole channel effect based on a pairing fluctuation theory @xcite , originally developed for treating the pseudogap phenomena of high @xmath2 superconductors .",
    "this theory has been successfully applied to atomic fermi gases and has been generating results that are in good agreement with experiment @xcite . here",
    "we include the entire particle - hole @xmath0-matrix , with gap effect included in the fermion green s functions . instead of a simple average of the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath8 on the fermi surface , here",
    "we choose to average at two different levels ",
    "one on the fermi surface , one over a narrow momentum shell around the fermi level .",
    "we find that @xmath8 has very strong frequency and momentum as well as temperature dependencies .",
    "it is sensitive to the gap size .",
    "therefore , self - consistently including the self - energy feedback is important . for both levels of average ,",
    "we find that while in the bcs limit , the particle - hole channel effect may be approximated by a downshift in the pairing strength so that the ratio @xmath4 is unaffected , the situation becomes more complex as the interaction becomes stronger where the gap is no longer very small .",
    "significant difference exists for these two levels of averaging .",
    "the particle - hole susceptibility is reduced by both a smaller fermi surface and a big ( pseudo)gap in the crossover regime .",
    "deep in the bec regime , the particle - hole channel contributions drop to zero . without including the incoherent part of the self energy",
    ", we find that at unitarity , @xmath9 , in reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first give a brief summary of the pairing fluctuation theory without the particle - hole channel effect .",
    "then we derive the theory with particle - hole channel included , starting by studying the dynamic structure of the particle - hole susceptibility .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "iii , we present numerical results , showing the effect of the particle - hole channel on the zero @xmath0 gap , transition temperature @xmath2 and pseudogap at @xmath2 , as well as the mean - field ratio @xmath3 .",

    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "more detailed results on the dynamic structure of the particle - hole susceptibility are presented in the appendix .",
    "to make this paper self - contained and to introduce the assumptions as well as the notations , we start by summarizing the pairing fluctuation theory @xcite without the effect of the particle - hole channel , as a foundation for adding the particle - hole channel .    -matrix @xmath11 and the self energy @xmath12 .",

    "the bare green s function @xmath33 comes from the inversion of the operator @xmath34 which appears on the left hand side of the equations of motion .",
    "it also appears in the particle - hole susceptibility @xmath8 , as will be shown below .",
    "albeit not a phi - derivable theory , the equation of motion method ensures that this theory is more consistent with the hamiltonian than a phi - derivable theory .",
    "the gap equation is given by the pairing instability condition , @xmath35 referred to as the thouless criterion , which can also be naturally interpreted as the bose condensation condition for the pairs , since @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath41 is the imaginary part of the pair dispersion and can be neglected when pairs become ( meta)stable @xcite . in the superfluid phase , @xmath42 diverges at @xmath43 and a macroscopic occupation of the @xmath43 cooper pairs , i.e. , the condensate , appears .",
