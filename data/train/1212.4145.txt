    "in july 2012 , the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations announced the discovery of a new boson , with a mass in the @xmath1 gev ballpark .",
    "although detailed studies of its properties need to be done in order to confirm its identity , one is tempted to interpret this new particle in terms of the long - awaited higgs boson . in any case , this constitutes a decisive breakthrough in high energy physics that , once correctly understood , will surely shed light on the dynamics of the electroweak scale .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson , and the measurement of its mass , reminds us a long - standing theoretical problem in particle physics : the famous hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "this can be expressed as the high sensitivity that fundamental scalars have to physics at high energies .",
    "unless one accepts a very precise fine - tuning of the parameters of the theory , the higgs mass is naturally pushed to those high energies , distabilizing the electroweak scale .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most popular solutions to the hierarchy problem .",
    "if the susy breaking scale is low ( not far from the tev scale ) , the electroweak scale is kept under control by virtue of the cancellations between bosonic and fermionic contributions to the higgs mass .",
    "+ when constructing a supersymmetric model one finds new gauge and susy invariant renormalizable interactions , not present in the standard model , that lead to lepton ( l ) and baryon ( b ) number violation . with the particle content of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", these are @xmath2_f,\\quad    [ l l e]_f,\\quad [ l q d]_f,\\quad [ u d d]_f,\\label{rpvt}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 stands for f - terms .",
    "if they were simultaneously present in the lagrangian , the proton would have a fast decay rate unless very small coefficients are introduced .",
    "for that reason , one usually introduces a discrete symmetry called r - parity , @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the spin of the particle ) , that forbids the l and b violating terms shown above  @xcite .",
    "the conservation of r - parity has very relevant phenomenological implications .",
    "this discrete symmetry stabilizes the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . as a consequence of that",
    ", supersymmetric events at colliders contain large amounts of missing energy in the final state .",
    "furthermore , if neutral , the lsp would be the perfect example of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) and a good dark matter candidate .",
    "r - parity has , however , some drawbacks .",
    "first of all , r - parity is introduced by hand in the mssm , without a theoretical explanation for its origin . and second",
    ", there are additional non - renormalizable interactions which , even though they break lepton and/or baryon numbers , are perfectly allowed by r - parity . even if these operators are generated at the planck scale , they would lead to unnacceptably fast proton decay unless their coefficients are tiny  @xcite . +",
    "many theoretical ideas have been proposed in order to explain the origin of r - parity .",
    "most of them consider r - parity as a remnant after the breaking of a larger symmetry group , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , in most cases there is no explanation for the suppression of the higher - dimensional operators . on the other hand , the origin of fermion masses hierarchies and mixings , the so - called flavor problem , is another long - standing mystery in particle physics . one interesting possibility to address",
    "the flavor problem is the introduction of an horizontal symmetry between the three generations of fermions .",
    "the flavor symmetry , which can be either continuous or discrete , imposes some structures on the yukawa couplings .    in this paper",
    "we propose that r - parity may be a consequence of the flavor symmetry . in this case , quark and lepton mixings , as well as the stability of proton and dark matter , can be explained in a common framework .",
    "we introduce a flavor model where all renormalizable as well as dimension five l or b violating operators are forbidden by the non - abelian flavor symmetry @xmath0 . charged femion masses and mixings can be fitted to their observed values . since the weinberg operator is also forbidden by the flavor symmetry , one is forced to go beyond minimal models if neutrino masses and mixings are to be explained .",
    "this turns out be a non - trivial task due to ( 1 ) the restrictions imposed by @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) our main motivation of not inducing r - parity violating terms .",
    "we find that this can be achieved by extending the lepton sector without inducing dangerous dimension five operators .",
    "neutrino mass arises from a variation of the inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite , called inverse type - iii seesaw mechanism  @xcite , that provides a correct description of neutrino mixings .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we present the model and main idea in section [ sec : model ] : how the introduction of a @xmath0 flavor symmetry can automatically lead to r - parity conservation and proton stability . afterwards , we discuss the flavor structure of the resulting quark and lepton sectors in sections [ sec : quarksector ] and [ sec : leptonsector ] , respectively . in the latter case",
    "we extend the original model in order to account for neutrino masses and show how the resulting neutrino mixing pattern can accommodate the data coming from oscillation experiments .",
    "finally , we conclude with a short summary and a brief discussion in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "let us consider the mssm extended by a @xmath0 flavor symmetry , see for instance @xcite .",
    "this discrete group is a subgroup of @xmath6 ( for a classification see  @xcite ) that belongs to the series @xmath7 .",
    "it has @xmath8 irreducible representations , namely two triplets @xmath9 , @xmath10 and 9 singlets @xmath11 .",
    "the product rules for the triplet representations are @xmath12 and @xmath13 . from these rules , it is clear that the product @xmath14 is invariant under @xmath0 whereas @xmath15 is not .",
    "we assign @xmath0 representations to the mssm particle content as shown in table [ model ] .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this assignment forbids all the aforementioned r - parity violating couplings in eq .",
    "( [ rpvt ] ) . therefore , r - parity results as an accidental symmetry originated by the underlying flavor symmetry of the model .    .@xmath0 charges of the mssm superfields . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     when the scalar component of @xmath16 gets a vev , an effective majorana mass for the @xmath17 triplet ( the fermionic component of the @xmath18 superfield ) is generated .",
    "this leads to an inverse seesaw mechanism  @xcite induced by @xmath19 triplets ( for other realizations of the _ inverse type - iii seesaw _ see  @xcite ) . in the basis @xmath20",
    ", we obtain the @xmath21 mass matrix for the neutral fermions @xmath22 which , assuming @xmath23 , leads to @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , it is worth emphasizing some advantages that our model has with respect to the conventional inverse seesaw .",
    "typically , in the context of inverse seesaw models it is quite difficult to forbid the @xmath27 mass term after ones allows for lepton number violation . here",
    "its absence is a direct consequence of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "moreover , in order to have new physics at the tev scale , that is @xmath28tev , and @xmath29 yukawa couplings , the parameter @xmath30 must be of the order of @xmath31 ev . in the original inverse seesaw mechanism",
    "the @xmath32 parameter is expected to be naturally small in the t hooft sence since the limit @xmath33 enhances the symmetry of the lagrangian ( lepton number is recovered ) .",
    "although this is not the case here , @xmath32 can be suppressed by means of the vev of the scalar @xmath34 . moreover ,",
    "several mechanisms to obtain dynamically a small @xmath32 parameter are known in the literature  @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", we consider a small @xmath32 parameter a natural choice .",
    "as mentioned above , the flavor symmetry forbids the weinberg operator .",
    "in fact , in this model neutrino masses are generated due to the effective operator @xmath35_f \\ , , \\ ] ] which is obtained after integrating out the @xmath36 superfields , as depicted in figure([mnu - dim6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the proposed model can be seen as a concrete renormalizable realization of this operator , which is the minimal implementation of majorana neutrino masses after the weinberg operator is forbidden .    _",
    "f$ ] realization . ]",
    "lepton number is explicitly broken by the trilinear superpotential term @xmath37 and thus no majoron , the goldstone boson associated to the spontaneous breaking of @xmath38 , appears in the spectrum .",
    "however , r - parity remains unbroken after the addition of this term , since @xmath34 carries two units of lepton number .",
    "one may also wonder about the appearance of new unwanted interactions after the introduction of the @xmath16 superfield .",
    "it is straightforward to check that no l or b violating renormalizable operators are allowed , apart from the aforementioned @xmath39 term .",
    "regarding higher dimensional operators , we note that the operator @xmath40_f$ ] is the only dimension 5 operator ( with l or b violation ) that is allowed by the symmetries .",
    "however , it can not be generated at tree - level , since @xmath41 does not couple to the quark superfields , and only some specific high - energy completions of our model would generate it at the ( less dangerous ) loop level .",
    "let us now discuss the resulting neutrino mixing pattern . using the @xmath0 contraction rules",
    ", one finds that the mass matrix @xmath42 is proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath43 and the matrix @xmath44 have the structures @xmath45 when all the scalar fields take vev in the @xmath46 direction . in this case , the charged lepton mass matrix fermions .",
    "this leads , however , to numerically irrelevant corrections in the leptonic mixing matrix . ]",
    "is diagonalized by the magic matrix @xmath47 , see eq .  .",
    "one can now perform a @xmath47 rotation in order to go to the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal . in this basis , the neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath48 where the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 are functions of @xmath51 . in general @xmath52 . by setting @xmath53",
    "we recover the result of the babu - ma - valle model  @xcite . in this limit , the mass matrix in eq .",
    "gives maximal atmospheric angle and degenerate neutrino mass spectrum , while the solar and reactor mixing angles are zero . as observed in @xcite , eq .",
    "is corrected by wave - function renormalizations of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , as well as the corresponding vertex renormalizations , lifting the neutrino degeneracy and the solar / reactor mixing angles .",
    "the resulting neutrino mass matrix can be written as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 parametrize the radiative corrections . when @xmath53 ( as in @xcite ) and assuming real @xmath58 corrections , the resulting neutrino mass matrix is @xmath59 symmetric giving maximal atmospherc angle and zero @xmath60 reactor angle .",
    "the solar angle is a free parameter and can be fitted .",
    "if the corrections are allowed to be complex , a non - zero value for @xmath60 can be obtained . in this case , cp violation is predicted to be maximal  @xcite . regarding the nature of the corrections , these come from flavor mixing in the slepton / sneutrino sector .",
    "a detailed study can be found in  @xcite .",
    "note that our model has more freedom since @xmath61 in general .",
    "this can be used to relax some of the restrictions in the parameter space .",
    "nevertheless , large @xmath62 mixing is necessary , typically predicting br(@xmath63 ) close to its experimental limit .",
    "furthermore , in the susy inverse seesaw one expects large z - penguin contributions in lepton flavor violating processes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , observables such as br(@xmath64 ) , with @xmath65 , are also expected to set important constraits on the susy parameter space .",
    "finally , violation of lepton flavor universality in observables such as @xmath66 and @xmath67 is also an important test of the model  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a supersymmetric flavor model based on the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "all lepton and/or baryon number violating operators of dimension 4 and 5 are forbidden by the flavor symmetry , thus providing a single explanation for the proton and dark matter stabilities .",
    "the extension to account for neutrino masses and mixings turned out to be non - trivial due to the restrictions imposed by the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "in fact , naive extensions of the leptonic sector typically spoil the nice features of the original model and depart from the main motivations for this work .",
    "we found that one can indeed generate neutrino masses by means of an inverse type - iii seesaw , while preserving r - parity and keeping the proton stable .",
    "the phenomenology of the complete model has been briefly discussed . in particular , the observed neutrino mixing pattern ( with a large reactor angle )",
    "can be well accommodated .    before concluding the paper we would like to comment on a difference that our setup has with respect to the canonical mssm : the existence of three higgs doublets .",
    "this feature , the replication of the minimal higgs sector , is shared by all flavor models where the usual higgs doublet is promoted to a multiplet of the flavor group .",
    "this typically implies very complicated scalar potentials , whose minimization leads to viable vacua ( from a phenomenological point of view ) thanks to the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "an example in the context of the @xmath68 symmetry can be found in ref .",
    "although the model under consideration here involves a different flavor symmetry , similar results are expected .",
    "a detailed minimization of the potential and determination of the scalar spectrum is clearly beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "furthermore , if the new scalar / pseudoscalar states can be made relatively light , one may expect sizable higgs - mediated contributions to flavor processes such as @xmath69 , @xmath70 or @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 denotes a neutral pseudoscalar meson ) . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "the extended higgs sector provides additional freedom to accommodate the observed @xmath1 gev higgs - like resonance found by atlas and cms .",
    "in fact , one can easily find regions in parameter space very similar to the so - called _ decoupling limit _ of the mssm , where the lightest scalar particle behaves as the sm higgs boson .",
    "we note that the non - standard corrections coming from the triplets are typically very small due to the relatively small yukawa couplings ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although most of the phenomenological features of our setup can be found in other flavor models , their combination is quite distinctive .",
    "in particular , the presence of the light @xmath73 @xmath19 fermion triplet leads to a very rich collider phenomenology , since it can be pair produced at the lhc due to its gauge interactions .",
    "this possibility , not present in singlet extensions of the mssm , may lead to very clear signatures with additional leptons and/or lepton flavor violation in the @xmath73 decays @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the assumption of r - parity in the mssm serves to stabilize the lsp .",
    "here we obtain the same result , _ r - parity _ , without assuming it .",
    "therefore , the usual mssm candidate , a neutralino lsp , can play the role of the dark matter of the universe .",
