    ", the electron can return to level 0 either by emitting the same photon or by relaxation such as the emission of fluorescent photons .",
    "the coupled atom - photon hamiltonian can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the photon energy , @xmath23 the energy difference between levels 1 and 0 and @xmath24 the broadening of level 1 induced by its relaxation .",

    "this of course implies that the photon number n is small compared to the total number of valence electrons . in order to possibly describe this phenomena in a simple way",
    ", this also implies that n is not too large to end with a set of n excitons , which can be considered as non - interacting , i.e. , all at the same energy .",

    "the coupled semiconductor - photon hamiltonian then reads as eq.([eq1 ] ) , where @xmath27 is now the ground state exciton @xcite creation operator .",

    "the operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 are defined as @xmath76 while @xmath77 and @xmath78 read as @xmath79 and @xmath80 with ( @xmath81 ) replaced by ( @xmath82 ) . for a finite exciton broadening , i.e. , @xmath83 ,",
    "the operators ( @xmath84 ) and ( @xmath85 ) appearing in @xmath69 are not conjugate .",

    ", the diagonal form of the coupled photon - exciton hamiltonian written in eq.([eq8 ] ) , has not been given before .",
    "the _ generalized polariton operators _ in the bra and ket space it contains , are however of conceptual importance to possibly describe photon - exciton interaction with relaxation .    by writing the photon creation operator @xmath26 in terms of @xmath91 and @xmath75 ,",
    "we can show , from the commutation relations ( [ eq11 ] ) and the expression of the hamiltonian given in eq.([eq8 ] ) , that the initial state @xmath92 , with @xmath93 being the exciton and photon vacuum , transforms into @xmath94 with @xmath95 within an irrevelant phase factor @xmath96 . @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the prefactors appearing in the time evolution of a two - level atom in the presence of n=1 photon , as given in eqs.([eq3],[eq4 ] ) .    from this compact expression of @xmath99 , it is easy to obtain the time evolution of the photon number @xmath100 .",

    "the time evolution of the photon number for an atom or a semiconductor initially in their ground state are given by eqs.([eq5],[eq16 ] ) .",
    "these analytical expressions can be used to obtain the photon number for any given set of experimental conditions .",

    "( ii ) in the absence of excited state relaxation _",
    ", i.e. , for @xmath114 , the sum @xmath115 stays equal to 1 .",
    "the photon number change n(t)=n-@xmath12(t ) reduces to @xmath116 in the case of atom and to n@xmath117 in the case of semiconductor , with @xmath118 being @xmath119 . at resonance ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath120=0 , we recover that for a dressed atom , the photon number oscillates , between n and ( n-1 ) , at the _ stimulated rabi frequency _ @xmath15 . for a semiconductor ,",
    "it oscillates , at the vacuum rabi frequency @xmath14 , between n and 0 , so that all the photons can possibly be transformed into excitons .",
    "when the detuning increases , the frequency of these oscillations increases , while the photon number stays closer to n.    _ ( iii ) when the excited state relaxation is included _ , i.e. , for @xmath70 , the sum @xmath115 decreases with time . for @xmath13 small ,",
    "the rabi oscillations are essentially damped , while with increasing @xmath13 , the decrease of @xmath115 ends by controlling the photon number change .",
    "for @xmath121 , the expansion of eqs.([eq6],[eq7 ] ) in @xmath122 , shows that , as @xmath123 @xmath124 for @xmath125 . using the above equations",
    ", we find that , for @xmath126 , the photon number of a two - level atom , given in eq.([eq5 ] ) , tends to @xmath127 while the one for a semiconductor , given in eq.([eq16 ] ) , tends to @xmath128 .",
    "since @xmath129 , this shows that , in this limit , @xmath130 with @xmath131 given by @xmath132 @xmath133 being a delta `` function '' of width @xmath13 .",
    "we see that , for @xmath13 large compared to @xmath1 and @xmath15 , the photon number for a two - level atom and a semiconductor , both behave as @xmath134 , the characteristic time of this exponential decay following a kind of fermi golden rule : @xmath135 is indeed the matrix element of the matter - photon coupling between the initial state , n photons and the matter in its ground state , and the excited state , ( n-1 ) photon and one excitation .",
    "the energy conservation it contains is however conceptually different from the standard one : it is linked to the energy uncertainty induced by the excited state broadening , not the one coming from the heisenberg principle , as in the usual fermi golden rule .",
    "the ground state of an atom or a semiconductor being not coupled to a continuum but to a discrete state , the exponential decay of the photon number does not come from destructive interferences between rabi oscillations , but from the broadening of the excited state itself , in a non trivial way : it is not a bare @xmath136 , but results from the interplay between @xmath13 and @xmath15 .",
    "this decay only exists when the excited state energy uncertainty @xmath13 is much larger than the strength of the stimulated matter - photon coupling .",
    "if we see the broadened excited state as a continuous set of states , all at the same energy , we can say , in a very crude way , that the delta `` function '' @xmath137 , which appears as a multicative factor in the decay rate , `` selects '' a part of this broadened excited state `` continuum '' , in the same way as the delta `` function '' , @xmath138 , of the usual fermi golden rule , `` selects '' the part of the continuum coupled to the ground state .      we have derived the time evolution of the photon number in the presence of an atom or semiconductor in their ground state , using the same framework .",
    "this led us to introduce generalized polariton operators dressed by the exciton finite lifetime , which differ in the bra and ket spaces .",
    "they actually are of conceptual importance for the study of photon - semiconductor interaction in the presence of relaxation .    when the photons couple the ground state to a _ discrete excited state which has an infinite lifetime _ , we recover that not only a single two - level atom , but also a _ macroscopic _",
    "@xcite semiconductor have rabi oscillations , at the stimulated frequency , @xmath16 , for atoms , and at the vacuum one , @xmath14 , for semiconductors .    on the opposite ,",
    "when the _ excited state lifetime is small _ , the photon number has the _ same _ exponential decay for atom and semiconductor , with a characteristic time given by the fermi golden rule .",
    "this rule can indeed be extended to _ transitions to a discrete state _ , provided that the discrete state is highly broadened compared to the stimulated matter - photon coupling , and that the `` energy conservation '' this fermi golden rule contains , is enforced at the scale of the excited state broadening .",
    "coupling with phonons scatters the photocreated excitons to other exciton states ; the semiconductor stays excited while , for a two - level atom , the electron returns to its ground state by fluorescent emission .",
    "rabi oscillations seen in quantum dots @xcite are actually similar to the ones of a two - level atom because in a dot , a given excited state can be occupied by one electron only ( if we forget spin ) while in an extended semiconductor , many electrons , all at the same energy , can be created ."
