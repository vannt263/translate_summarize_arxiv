    "classical novae inject nuclear processed material into the interstellar medium , and therefore may play a role in the galactic nucleosynthesis .",
    "isotopes likely attributed to nova outbursts include @xmath3c , @xmath4n and @xmath5o ( see jos & hernanz 1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "current hydrodynamic models of classical novae show that explosions on carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( hereafter , co novae ) are dominated by the synthesis of cno - group nuclei , largely overproduced in the ejecta with respect to solar abundances ( starrfield et al .",
    "1997 ; kovetz & prialnik 1997 ; jos & hernanz 1998 ) . on the other hand , explosions on oxygen - neon white dwarfs ( hereafter , one novae ) , more massive than co ones ,",
    "provide large enrichments not only in cno nuclei , but also in neon , sodium , aluminum , or other intermediate - mass elements ( starrfield et al .",
    "1998 ; jos & hernanz 1998 ; jos et al .",
    "hence , the composition of the ejecta is a key signature of the nature of the underlying white dwarf ( co or one ) and provides also valuable information on the explosion ( i.e. , peak temperature , characteristic timescale ... ) . in particular ,",
    "the presence of isotopes of the silicon to calcium mass region ( hereafter , si - ca ) , overproduced with respect to solar values , in the ejecta of a classical nova , may reveal the presence of an underlying massive white dwarf ( the ones reaching the higher peak temperatures during the explosion ) since proton captures on nuclei above silicon require temperatures in excess of @xmath6 k to overcome their large coulomb barriers . indeed , abundance determinations from some observed novae , such as v1370 aql 1982 ( snijders et al .",
    "1987 ) , qu vul 1984 ( andre et al . 1994 ) , v2214 oph 1988 ( andre et al . 1994 ) , or v838 her 1991 ( vanlandingham et al . 1996 , 1997 ) , show the presence of si - ca nuclei in the ejecta .",
    "moreover , the nova contribution to the galactic content of other species such as @xmath7li ( starrfield et al .",
    "1978 , hernanz et al . 1996 ) or @xmath8al ( politano et al .",
    "1995 , jos et al .",
    "1997 , starrfield et al .",
    "1998 , jos et al . 1999 ) may also be significant , although its real extent is still a matter of debate ( see romano et al . 1999 , for details on the contribution of novae to match the @xmath7li content in realistic calculations of galactic chemical evolution ) .",
    "the synthesis of such medium- or long - lived species has , in turn , implications for the high - energy emission during nova outbursts : several gamma - ray signatures have been predicted for nova outbursts ( clayton & hoyle 1974 ; leising & clayton 1987 ; gmez - gomar et al .",
    "1998 , hernanz et al . 1999 ) , including a 478 kev line from @xmath9li ( co novae ) , a 1275 kev line from @xmath10na ( one novae ) , and an intense 511 kev line and the corresponding continuum at energies below ( for both co and one nova types ) . in the si - ca mass region ,",
    "another gamma - ray signal , coming from the @xmath11-decay of the medium lived @xmath12cl ( isomeric state ) , has also been proposed for 511 kev ( leising & clayton 1987 ) and 2.128  mev ( coc et al .",
    "2000a ) line emission .",
    "however , no nucleosynthesis calculation with realistic nuclear reaction rates has , up to now , been attempted to evaluate the chances for the potential detection of this particular gamma - ray signal from novae .",
    "furthermore , the recent discovery of a number of presolar grains likely formed in the ejecta of classical novae ( amari et al . , 2001 ) also points out the importance of a good determination of the abundance pattern , in particular in the si - ca mass region : together with a number of constraints from specific isotopic ratios ( i.e. , low @xmath13c/@xmath3c and @xmath14n/@xmath4n values , high @xmath8al/@xmath15al ) , the basic feature that points towards a nova origin relies on the large excesses in @xmath1si/@xmath16si and close - to - solar @xmath17si/@xmath16si measured in such grains .",
    "the determination of other isotopic ratios in this mass range , such as @xmath18s/@xmath19s , may also help to identify future nova grain candidates .",
    "these aspects point out the interest of a more accurate determination of the relevant synthesis mechanisms in the si - ca mass region .",
    "such an analysis has been only scarcely attempted ( see recent parametrized nucleosynthesis calculations by lefevbre et al .",
    "1997 , wanajo et al . 1999 , and iliadis et al . 1999 , as well as hydrodynamic calculations by starrfield et al . 1998 ) , partially because of the large number of isotopes of interest in this mass region , around 40 species , and the hundred nuclear reactions involved .",
    "accordingly , it is the purpose of this paper to determine the dominant nuclear paths involved in the synthesis of intermediate - mass elements , from si to ca , during classical nova outbursts , identifying the key reactions and investigating their associated nuclear uncertainties , that may have a dramatic influence in the overall process . in section 2 ,",
    "we outline the basic nuclear paths at different stages of the nova outburst for a particular model .",
    "details on nuclear physics aspects are given in section 3 .",
    "constraints on the production of si - ca group nuclei , together with the most relevant conclusions of this paper are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the high temperatures required to initiate a noticeable nuclear activity in the si - ca group nuclei restrict the domain of interest to explosions in very massive white dwarfs ( i.e. , close to the chandrasekhar mass ) . in this section , we will focus on the main nuclear paths involved in the synthesis of several isotopes within this mass range , through a detailed analysis of a 1.35 m@xmath0 one white dwarf , which accretes solar - like matter at a rate of @xmath20 m@xmath0.yr@xmath21 , assuming a 50% degree of mixing with the outermost shells of the white dwarf core . initial abundances of the si - ca group nuclei adopted in this model are listed in table 1 ( abundances up to si are given in jos et al . 1999 ,",
    "table 1 ) .",
    "in fact , the specific prescription adopted for the initial abundance pattern is crucial for nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "whereas a deep analysis of this effect is out of the scope of this paper , and will be presented elsewhere , we just point out that it introduces some uncertainty in all current nucleosynthesis calculations during nova outbursts .",
    "the main source for the production of the si ",
    "ca isotopes ( see fig .",
    "1 ) comes from the processing of the initial ne ",
    "al isotopes from the white dwarf leaking out of the nena and mgal mass regions , mainly through @xmath16si .",
    "we do not discuss here the nuclear processing within these regions but refer the reader to a previous paper ( jos et al .",
    "hence we start our discussion with the last reactions linking the mgal to sip mass regions",
    ". the new evolutionary sequences of nova outbursts have been calculated by means of the code shiva ( see jos & hernanz 1998 for details ) , a one - dimensional implicit hydrodynamical code that follows the course of the explosion from the onset of accretion up to the ejection stages .",
    "calculations have been performed with a nuclear reaction network updated for the region of interest ( see section 3 ) .",
    "snapshots of the evolution of the most relevant elements are shown in figures 2 to 6 .    at the early stages of the explosion , nuclear activity above cno cycle",
    "is mostly confined in the nena and mgal region with only marginal activity in the si  ca region . soon after the thermonuclear runaway takes place , when the temperature at the burning shell reaches @xmath22 k ( figs . 2 to 6 , first panel )",
    ", the main nuclear path affecting si to ca evolution is dominated by a series of reactions , beginning with proton captures onto @xmath23al ( ground state ) , @xmath23al(p,@xmath2)@xmath15si , followed by @xmath15si(@xmath11)@xmath15al(p,@xmath2)@xmath16si . as a result , @xmath15si is slightly enhanced at the burning shell , since its @xmath11-decay channel is slower than @xmath23al(p,@xmath2 ) .",
    "marginal nuclear activity at the burning shell involves other proton - capture reactions on @xmath24al and @xmath25al ( isomeric state ) , as well as onto @xmath15si , which account for a moderate increase in @xmath8si and @xmath16p .",
    "no relevant nuclear activity beyond phosphorus is found .",
    "evolution at @xmath26 k ( figs . 2 to 6 , second panel ) is still dominated by the chain @xmath23al(p , @xmath2)@xmath15si(@xmath11)@xmath15al(p,@xmath2)@xmath16si , plus the contribution of @xmath24al(p,@xmath2)@xmath8si(@xmath11)@xmath25al(p,@xmath2)@xmath15si , and @xmath15si(p,@xmath2)@xmath16p(@xmath11)@xmath16si .",

    "only one sulfur isotope , @xmath17s , shows a noticeable variation : it is , in fact , increased by ( p,@xmath2 ) reactions on @xmath16p nuclei at the burning shell , and shortly after , carried away to the outer envelope by means of convective transport .",

    "( 2001 ) , published after this work was completed , the two last compilations of thermonuclear rates end at silicon , either with @xmath1si(p,@xmath40p ( caughlan & fowler 1988 , hereafter cf88 ) or @xmath16si(p,@xmath85p ( angulo et al . 1999 ,",

    "the inspection of figure 1 , shows that this reaction plays a key role as @xmath1p is a mandatory passing point to reach heavier nuclei and with its relatively long lifetime ( @xmath88=2.5  mn ) it stops further nucleosynthesis unless proton captures are fast enough .",
    "accordingly we investigate the effect of a possible change of this rate by a test factor of 100 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath27p(p,@xmath41s and @xmath27p(p,@xmath89si reaction rates are deduced from experimental results ( iliadis et al . 1991 ; 1993 ; ross et al . 1995 ) .",
    "while the first one is well known , the second still suffers from uncertainties ( @xmath90100 ) between @xmath91 = 0.1 and 0.2 due to unknown resonance strengths .",
    "however , even the upper limit of the @xmath27p(p,@xmath89si rate remains smaller than the @xmath27p(p,@xmath41s one at nova temperature .",
    "hence this uncertainty should scarcely affect @xmath27p destruction and nucleosynthesis beyond phosphorus .      for @xmath1s(p,@xmath2)@xmath27cl",
    ", we use the rate calculated by herndl et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from shell model calculations .",
    "another rate was provided by van  wormer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) based on the properties of the analog levels in @xmath27cl .",
    "the two rates differ by a factor of @xmath9030 ( fig . 1 in herndl et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ) due to the unknown location of the first excited state in @xmath27cl .",
    "this should however have little effect since photodisintegration of @xmath27cl is fast ( q=0.286 mev ) .",
    "the @xmath27s(p,@xmath41cl reaction rate was first studied by vouzoukas et al .",
    "they measured the energy of the relevant @xmath19cl levels via a @xmath19s(@xmath92he,@xmath93cl transfer reaction .",
    "they used experimental spectroscopic factors from the @xmath19p analog levels and radiative widths from shell model calculations and their calculated ratios ( @xmath94 ) are compatible with the lefevbre et al .",
    "( 1997 ) measurements . a detailed investigation of the uncertainty affecting this rate has been performed recently by iliadis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) leading to a nominal rate ( adopted here ) slightly lower than the previous one ( vouzoukas et al .",
    "1994 ) , and a factor of 3 uncertainty in the domain of nova nucleosynthesis .",
    "one can thus consider this rate as sufficiently known .",
    "the @xmath19s(p,@xmath95cl reaction rate was calculated by iliadis et al .",
    "( 1992 ) from measured resonance strengths or extracted spectroscopic factors ( see also iliadis et al .",
    "1999 , footnote in table 7 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on this rate was found to be very small ( thompson & iliadis 1999 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that the rate deduced from experimental data is much smaller ( see iliadis et al .",
    "1992 ) than the previously adopted reaction rate .    for the reactions @xmath18s(p,@xmath2)@xmath96cl , we have taken into account the formation of both the @xmath28cl ground ( @xmath88 = 1.53  s ) and isomeric ( @xmath88 = 32.0 min ) states which , as in , have to be treated as separate isotopes ( coc et al .",
    "2000a ) at nova temperatures .",
    "we considered the resonances corresponding to the first five levels above threshold ( endt 1990 ) .",
    "their branching ratios to the ground or isomeric states were extracted from endt ( 1990 ) .",
    "for the four unknown resonance strengths , we used upper limits with the usual 0.1 reduction factor .",
    "they were obtained from estimates of the proton widths ( @xmath97 ) based on calculation of single particle in a wood - saxon potential whose depth is adjusted so as to reproduce the excitation energy of the resonance .",
    "the corresponding estimated @xmath18s(p,@xmath98cl rate is given by : @xmath99 where the multiplying factors ( 1 .",
    ", 0.89 , 0.64 , 0.76 and 0.5 ) correspond to the branching ratios to the isomeric state ( endt 1990 ) . the @xmath18s(p,@xmath100cl is hence given by replacing these factors by ( 0 .",
    ", 0.11 , 0.36 , 0.24 and 0.5 ) . the last term is a multiresonant contribution from the higher energy resonances ( endt 1990 ) with an assumed average branching ratio of 0.5 .",
    "formation of  proceeds only through the @xmath18s(p,@xmath98cl reaction since , after internal transitions , @xmath28ar @xmath11-decays lead only to  ( a similar configuration is found for @xmath8al ) .",
    "an important aspect of  nucleosynthesis is its destruction by thermally induced radiative transitions to its short lived ground state .",
    "the corresponding effective lifetime , that we use here , has been calculated ( shell model ) by coc et al .",
    "( 2000a ) : it exhibits a rapid evolution ( 3 orders of magnitude ) from its laboratory half - life value of 32.0  min down to @xmath1011  s. this transition occurs around t@xmath1020.15 - 0.2 , a typical domain of temperatures in novae , and this strongly modifies the prospect for its detectability through its gamma - ray signature .",
    "other nuclei , such as @xmath62al , have also isomers in the mass region of nova nucleosynthesis but they are at the fringe of nuclear flow and their lifetimes are much less affected than @xmath28cl at nova temperatures .    with some notable exceptions like @xmath29cl(p,@xmath2 ) and @xmath103ar(p,@xmath2 ) ( see also the very recent compilation of iliadis et al .",
    "2001 ) , experimental and theoretical ( i.e. , shell model , see herndl et al .",
    "1995 ) data are in general not sufficient to allow the explicit calculation of the rates at nova temperatures for reactions beyond sulfur . accordingly",
    ", we use the smoker rates instead ( thielemann et al .",
    "1987 ) which are virtually identical to the more recent most rates from goriely ( 1996 ) , for these nuclei close to stability .",
    "table 2 shows the mean composition of the ejecta , for the si - ca mass region , corresponding to the 1.35 m@xmath0 one nova described in section 2 ( hereafter , model 135nom ) .",
    "the most abundant nuclei , for this specific mass range , are @xmath19s , @xmath16si , @xmath1si , @xmath27p and @xmath17si . for the purpose of comparison , a very similar model ( i.e. , model one135b .",
    "see jos , coc & hernanz 1999 ) , computed with a previous nuclear reaction network , is also shown in table 2 .",
    "both nuclear reaction networks are very similar up to silicon .",
    "recent updates included in the new computations involve @xmath104f(p,@xmath2 ) , @xmath104f(p,@xmath48 ) ( coc et al . 2000b , nominal rates ) , @xmath5o(p,@xmath2 ) , @xmath5o(p,@xmath48 ) ( nacre , nominal rates ) , and also @xmath27p(p,@xmath2 ) , @xmath27p(p,@xmath48 ) , @xmath27s(p,@xmath2 ) , @xmath19s(p,@xmath2 ) , @xmath18s(p,@xmath2 ) ( leading to both @xmath96cl ) , and the corresponding @xmath96cl , temperature - dependent @xmath11-decays ( see section 3 for specific references ) . as expected , no significant differences are found for si or p yields when we switch to the updated network since , as discussed in coc et al .",
    "( 2000b ) , proton captures onto @xmath5o or @xmath104f do nt play a dominant role in the energetics of the explosion , and hence , a similar peak temperature and characteristic timescales for the evolution are found .",
    "differences , however , are found for @xmath19s and beyond .",
    "in fact , the new @xmath19s yield increases by a factor of 2 , because of the larger new @xmath27p(p,@xmath2 ) rate ( below @xmath105 k and also in the vicinity of @xmath36 ) and the lower @xmath19s(p,@xmath95cl destruction rate . on the contrary , @xmath106s , @xmath107cl and @xmath108ar",
    "are dramatically reduced by , at least , a factor of 10 .",
    "this remarkable change results mainly from the update of the @xmath19s(p,@xmath2 ) rate , much lower than the previous one in the domain of nova temperatures , as pointed out by iliadis et al .",
    "hence , whereas the arguments to invoke a likely nova origin for a number of presolar meteoritic grains ( see amari et al .",
    "2001 ) remain unaffected by the results reported in this paper ( i.e. , silicon excesses ) , the differences found for other nuclear species , in particular the @xmath19s/@xmath18s ratios , are relevant for the unambiguous identification of future nova grain candidates : for instance , the previous @xmath19s/@xmath18s isotopic ratio of 3.1 , found for model one135b , has now raised up to 97 for model 135nom , basically due to the update of the @xmath27p(p,@xmath2 ) and @xmath19s(p,@xmath2 ) rates .",
    "it is also worth noting that our numerical calculations reveal the presence of the gamma - ray emitter @xmath12cl in the ejected envelope .",
    "however , its content has been dramatically reduced by the update of the @xmath19s(p,@xmath2)@xmath18cl and @xmath18s(p,@xmath2)@xmath109cl rates , together with the @xmath12cl @xmath11-decay : whereas a mean mass fraction of @xmath110 , 30 minutes after @xmath36 , was found for model one135b , only @xmath111 by mass , remain , for the same time , in the present model 135nom .",
    "hence , the possibility of a potential detection of the gamma ray emission corresponding to @xmath12cl @xmath11-decay , invoked as another signature of a classical novae ( see leising & clayton 1987 ) , seems to be ruled out with the present calculations .    as pointed out ,",
    "one of the most relevant outcomes of this study , from the nuclear physics viewpoint , is the crucial role played by @xmath1p(p,@xmath2 ) in the synthesis of heavier nuclear species .",
    "its purely theoretical rate is questionable since the model used for its calculation reaches its limits for such a light nucleus at low temperature .",
    "hence , we have estimated its impact on the yields by computing two new evolutionary sequences of nova models , for which we have arbitrarily modified the @xmath1p(p,@xmath2 ) rate : model p30low , where the @xmath1p(p,@xmath2 ) has been reduced by a test factor of 100 throughout the calculation , and model p30high , where the nominal rate has been arbitrarily multiplied by 100 .",
    "results are summarized also in table 2 .",
    "the increase by a factor of 100 affects only the @xmath1si yield : since the path towards @xmath27s is favored ( which in turn , accounts for the moderate increase of @xmath27p in the ejecta ) , much less @xmath1si ( coming from @xmath1p(@xmath11 ) ) is left in the envelope .",
    "however , the impact on other nuclear species is very limited . on the contrary , when the @xmath1p(p,@xmath2 ) rate is reduced by a factor of 100 , dramatic changes in the expected yields occur",
    "now , @xmath1p(@xmath11 ) competes favorably with proton captures , and an important enhancement of @xmath1si is obtained .",
    "in fact , the reduction of the proton capture rate halts significantly the synthesis of elements above si ( by a factor of @xmath83 10 with respect to the values found with the nominal rate ) .",
    "we have compared our results with the latest available results from hydrodynamic simulations of one novae by starrfield et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : they state that the switch to an updated nuclear network ( iliadis et al .",
    "2001 ) is accompanied by an important reduction of the abundances of nuclei above aluminum , in good agreement with the results found here .",
    "however , our new computations show that reduction of the yields affect only nuclei above @xmath19s .",
    "in fact , a significant reduction of @xmath19s results only when we adopt the low @xmath1p(p,@xmath2 ) test rate .",
    "hence , this discrepancy might be likely attributed to a different prescription for the adopted @xmath1p(p,@xmath2 ) rate . in particular , the rate used by starrfield et al .",
    "( 2001 ) seems to be somewhat lower than the nominal rate adopted in our paper , which stresses again the crucial dependence of the s  ca yields on this particular rate .    despite a detailed comparison with observations is out of the scope of this paper , because a larger number of nova models is required to properly explore the wide parameter space , some conclusions can be outlined . in fact , spectroscopic abundance determinations show evidence for some overproduction of nuclei in the si  ca mass region in a number of classical novae , including silicon ( nova aql 1982 , snijders et al .",

    "indeed , models of explosions in 1.35 m@xmath0 one white dwarfs have an end - point for nucleosynthesis below calcium , hence in agreement with observations .",
    "this suggests that peak temperatures attained at the burning shell during nova outbursts can not be much larger than @xmath6 k , otherwise an rp - process would result at such high temperatures , driving the nuclear path towards heavier species , not observed so far .",
    "moreover , as stated in the discussion of the main nuclear paths , determination of chemical abundances in the si - ca mass region during nova outbursts is affected by uncertainties of nuclear physics origin .",
    "in particular , the uncertainty associated to @xmath1p(p,@xmath2 ) makes it difficult to determine realistic abundances above silicon , and to clarify as well whether the path towards heavier species is halted or , on the contrary , if significant production of si - ca nuclei is still expected",
