    "the classification of three and four manifolds is one of the open questions which has been addressed by both mathematicians and physicists . in particular",

    ".    witten s pioneering work @xcite established a three - dimensional definition for knots and links . in particular , jones and homflypt polynomials and their recursion relations were obtained from chern - simons gauge theory based on @xmath12 and @xmath13 gauge groups .",
    "we can relate coupling constant @xmath4 and the rank @xmath14 to the polynomial variables of homflypt polynomials .",
    "similarly , the jones polynomial variable @xmath15 will be related as @xmath16 .",

    ", we will take the gauge group @xmath27 .",
    "for the four - punctured @xmath18 boundary , we can chose eigenbasis @xmath28 if the braiding is in the side two - strands .",

    "hence the braiding eigenvalue in the blackboard framing is useful to obtain regular isotopy invariants . in the trefoil example",
    ", we could place parallel orientation in the middle two - strands .",
    "as the crossing sign due to braiding is positive , we called such a braiding as right - handed braiding .",
