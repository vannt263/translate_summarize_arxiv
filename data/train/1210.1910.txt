    "another novelty of the strange quark matter hypothesis concerns the existence of a new class of white - dwarf - like objects , referred to as strange ( quark matter ) dwarfs ( ( * ? ? ? * glendenning et al .",
    "the mass - radius relationship of the latter may differs somewhat from the mass - radius relationship of ordinary white - dwarf , which may be testable in the future . until        recently , only rather vague tests of the theoretical mass - radius relation of white dwarfs were possible .",

    "these data allow the first accurate measurements of white dwarf distances and , as a result , establishing the mass - radius relation of such objects empirically .",
    "of considerable relevance for the viability of the strange matter hypothesis is the question of whether strange stars can exhibit glitches in rotation frequency . from the study performed by (",
    "* glendenning & weber ( 1992 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zdunik et al . ( 2001 ) ) it is known that the ratio of the crustal moment of inertia to the total moment of inertia varies between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the factor @xmath22 represents the fraction of the crustal moment of inertia that is altered in the quake .",
    "since the observed glitches have relative frequency changes @xmath23 , a change in the crustal moment of inertia of @xmath24 would cause a giant glitch ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* glendenning & weber 1992 ) ) .",
    "moreover it turns out that the observed range of the fractional change in the spin - down rate , @xmath25 , is consistent with the crust having a small moment of inertia and the quake involving only a small fraction @xmath22 of that . for this purpose",
    "we write @xmath26 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* glendenning & weber 1992 ) ) .",
    "this relation yields a small @xmath22 value , i.e. , @xmath27 , in agreement with @xmath24 established just above . for these estimates ,",
    "the measured values of @xmath28 to @xmath29 for crab and vela , respectively , have been used .",
    "one of the most amazing features of quark stars concerns the possible existence of ultra - high electric fields on their surfaces , which , for ordinary quark matter , is around @xmath0  v / cm . if strange matter forms a color superconductor , as expected for such matter , the strength of the electric field may increase to values that exceed @xmath1  v / cm .",
    "the energy density associated with such huge electric fields is on the same order of magnitude as the energy density of strange matter itself , which alters the masses and radii of strange quark stars at the 15% and 5% level , respectively ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* negreiros et al .",
    "such mass increases facilitate the interpretation of massive compact stars , with masses of around @xmath30 , as strange quark stars ( see also ( * ? ? ?",

    "the electrons at the surface of a quark star are not necessarily in a fixed position but may rotate with respect to the quark matter star ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* negreiros et al . 2010 ) ) . in this event magnetic fields can be generated which , for moderate effective rotational frequencies between the electron layer and the stellar body , agree with the magnetic fields inferred for several compact central objects ( ccos ) .",
    "these objects could thus be interpreted as quark stars whose electron atmospheres rotate at frequencies that are moderately different ( @xmath31  hz ) from the rotational frequency of the quark star itself .",
    "last but not least , we mention that the electron surface layer may be strongly affected by the magnetic field of a quark star in such a way that the electron layer performs vortex hydrodynamical oscillations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* xu et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "the frequency spectrum of these oscillations has been derived in analytic form by @xcite .",
    "if the thermal x - ray spectra of quark stars are modulated by vortex hydrodynamical oscillations , the thermal spectra of compact stars , foremost central compact objects ( ccos ) and x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdinss ) , could be used to verify the existence of these vibrational modes observationally . the central compact object",
    "1e 1207.4 - 5209 appears particularly interesting in this context , since its absorption features at 0.7 kev and 1.4 kev can be comfortably explained in the framework of the hydro - cyclotron oscillation model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* xu et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "a study which looks at the thermal evolution of ccos is presently being carried out by @xcite .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the observed temperatures of ccos can be well reproduced if one assumes that these objects are small quark matter objects with radii less than around 3  km .",
    "if quarks stars are made of color superconducting quark matter rather than normal non - superconducting quark matter .",
    "if rotating , superconducting quark stars ought to be threaded with rotational vortex lines , within which the star s interior magnetic field is at least partially confined . the vortices ( and thus magnetic flux )",
    "would be expelled from the star during stellar spin - down , leading to magnetic reconnection at the surface of the star and the prolific production of thermal energy .",
    "@xcite have shown that this energy release can re - heat quark stars to exceptionally high temperatures , such as observed for soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , and x - ray dim isolated neutron stars ( xdins ) . moreover ,",
    "numerical investigations of the temperature evolution , spin - down rate , and magnetic field behavior of such superconducting quark stars suggest that sgrs , axps , and xdins may be linked ancestrally ( ( * ? ? ?",
