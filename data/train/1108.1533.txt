    "exciton condensates ( ecs ) are ordered states of matter in which macroscopic phase coherence is established through the condensation of electron - hole pairs . since its early prediction in the sixties  @xcite",
    "there has been considerable experimental and theoretical activity in this field .",
    "signatures of exciton condensation have been reported in quantum hall bilayers  @xcite , and in optically - excited exciton  @xcite and exciton - polariton  @xcite cold gases .",
    "early on it was understood  @xcite that spatially separating electrons and holes into two distinct and decoupled ( semiconducting ) layers could be extremely useful to suppress electron - hole recombination , and in this way to enhance the possibility of realizing an exciton condensate . in the quantum hall regime ,",
    "exciton - condensation in bilayers can be realized in equilibrium by condensing electrons and holes in conduction band landau levels that are localized in separate layers  @xcite .    when single - particle inter - layer tunneling processes can be neglected , exciton - condensation in bilayers is equivalent to spontaneous inter - layer phase coherence  @xcite . as a result double - layer ecs support a dissipationless  counterflow \" transport channel in which all electron - hole pairs drift together , giving rise to equilibrium counterpropagating currents in the two layers .",
    "when the two layers of a bilayer ec are separately contacted  @xcite remarkable transport anomalies  @xcite , associated with its neutral counterflow supercurrents  @xcite , are observed . in the absence of a magnetic field , bilayer exciton condensation can be enabled by gating the fermi level in one layer to the conduction band and the fermi level of the other layer to the valence band .",
    "two experimental groups  @xcite have recently reported the observation of an anomalous upturn in the coulomb drag transresistivity as the temperature is lowered . this upturn is interpreted as being due to strong pairing fluctuations that precede exciton condensation  @xcite and thus serves as a precursor signal for the transition that is similar to the enhancement of conductivity in superconductors due to superconducting fluctuations above but close to the critical temperature  @xcite .    despite growing experimental evidence , a definite confirmation of exciton condensation in bilayers in the absence of a magnetic field is still elusive .",
    "the identification of new effects that may highlight the physics of ecs is thus highly desirable . in this article",

    "the proximity effect is intimately related to the microscopic mechanism of transport through superconductor - normal metal interfaces . at voltages and temperatures below the superconducting gap the dominant process is andreev reflection  @xcite .",
    "an electron incoming from the normal metal is reflected as a hole at the interface with the superconductor , with consequent injection of a cooper pair into the superconductor . since its discovery in 1966 , the study of andreev reflection has offered many surprises .",
    "of particular interest is the regime where the ( incoming ) particle and the ( reflected ) hole preserve their phase coherence across the normal metal  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to envisage that the interplay between phase - coherent electron propagation in metals and macroscopic phase coherence in the superconductor will be of fundamental importance at an ec - superconductor interface , where the neutral ec superfluid current has to convert onto a ( charged ) cooper pair current .",

    "the electron and hole densities in the two layers can be tuned separately through external gates .",

    "the dispersion relation can be linearized around the fermi energy @xmath7 . in this large fermi - energy limit terms of @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are automatically set to zero , where @xmath4 and @xmath1 are the superconducting and ec order parameters , respectively ( see below ) . in the literature",

    "however , self - consistency would introduce only negligible quantitative changes of the results . a more detailed discussion on the situations in which self - consistency is unimportant and the order parameters can be taken to have a step - like form is discussed in ref .  .",
    "the ec order parameter @xmath26 is assumed to be uniform in amplitude in the ec region ( @xmath27 ) and zero otherwise . in order to account for the neutral counterflow current",
    ", the phase of the condensate is allowed to be space - dependent .",
    "current conservation in one dimension for an order parameter with a constant amplitude implies the following functional dependence on @xmath28 : @xmath29 where the wave vector @xmath30 and the phase @xmath31 are to be fixed by free - energy minimization .",
    "the superconducting order parameter , on the other hand , is assumed to be different from zero only in the electrodes : @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the sake of convenience , we have assumed that only the phases vary from one superconductor to the other . because charge is conserved separately in the two layers ,",
    "the number of independent phases is reduced to _ two _ , which we take to be the phase differences between left and right electrodes in the top and bottom layers .    because the potentials are constant and are never simultaneously non - zero , it is easy to solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equations separately in the excitonic and superconducting regions .",
    "( see appendix  [ app : sol ] . ) in addition to the distance between the electrodes , @xmath2 , the other length scales which must be considered in coupling different regions are the exciton and superconducting coherence lengths , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and , at finite temperature , the thermal length @xmath36 [ with @xmath37 .",
    "the josephson current in this four - terminal system has two contributions .",
    "the first one is related to direct quasi - particle tunneling through the barrier caused by the gap in the bilayer quasi - particle spectrum .",
    "this process is present in ordinary superconductor - insulator - superconductor two - terminal setups .",
    "the second contribution , which is the main subject of interest here , is linked to the possibility of direct dissipationless conversion of supercurrents into ec counterflow currents and can be realized only in a four - terminal setup like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "importantly , in the limit @xmath38 the first contribution is exponentially suppressed and only the second one survives . in this case , equilibrium properties will ultimately depend only on _ one _ phase variable .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to this regime , and address the following two distinct limits : @xmath39 we will further extend our results to the  tunneling limit \" ( _ i.e. _ the regime in which the contacts have a low transparency ) in which the josephson effect was originally studied .",
    "our results in this case are qualitatively similar to the ones in the ballistic regime .",
    "the conversion of supercurrent into counterflow ( neutral ) current hidden in the solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations , takes place through a coherent andreev - like process which involves _ two _ cooper pairs in the two different layers .",
    "we find it useful to give a brief illustration of this process before going into the details of our results for the josephson current .",
    "a detailed derivation will be presented in the following sections and in the appendices .",
    "it is sufficient to consider only one superconductor - ec interface as shown in fig .",
    "it is useful to imagine a thin normal region between the superconducting and ec regions in which the bilayer is in its normal phase with _ both _ order parameters set to zero .",
    "we limit our attention here to energies smaller than the ec and superconducting gaps .",
    "as already discussed , the wave function has four distinct amplitudes @xmath40 .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is responsible for the andreev reflection process in which an electron impinging on the superconductor from the normal region is reflected as a hole and overall current is conserved because an electron cooper pair is created ( or equivalently a hole cooper pair is destroyed ) .",
    "this process is illustrated on the left side of the bottom layer in fig .",
    "the time reversed process is obviously allowed as well and is illustrated on the top left of fig .",
    "[ car ] . for the wave function",
    "this implies the following two relations between up and down spin amplitudes in the same layer : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are complex number with @xmath43 .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( as well as for the quantities @xmath46 and @xmath47 defined below ) as functions of the energy will be calculated later in the paper .",
    "an analogous process takes place at the normal - ec interface . as shown on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ car ] , a particle ( either electron or hole ) impinging on the ec from the top layer is reflected into the bottom layer upon emission ( or absorption ) of an electron - hole pair ( exciton ) .",
    "the same process allows a particle to go from the bottom to the top layer .",
    "the following two additional relations between top and bottom layer amplitudes capture these processes @xmath48 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are complex numbers with @xmath49 . combining the four amplitude relations we conclude that @xmath50 solving eq",
    ".   determines the energy of a state that is bound to an interface by the gaps in both superconducting and excitonic regions .",
    "we refer to this state as to an _ excitonic andreev bound state _",
    "( eabs in the following ) it is well known that andreev bound states in superconductor - normal metal - superconductor systems  @xcite are responsible for the flow of josephson current .",
    "although they differ in origin and in properties , eabs will also be crucial for supercurrent conversion from the contacts to the exciton condensate .",
    "indeed , using general arguments based on current conservation , it is natural to expect that a phase bias applied between the top or bottom superconducting electrodes will result in a josephson current equal in magnitude but _ opposite _ in sign in the two layers .",
    "this must be true since only counterflow currents can flow deep in the ec .",
    "when the total energy of the system is minimized to find an equilibrium state , the counterflow current generated at the left junction must be absorbed at the right .",
    "the total josephson current then turns out to depend only on the _ difference of the phase differences _ across the top and the bottom layers , as we show explicitly below .",
    "four - particle coherent andreev reflection .",
    " this illustration is a schematic for the process responsible for the conversion of supercurrent from the two superconductors into an excitonic counterflow supercurrent .",
    "an artificial normal ( n ) region in which both superconducting and ec pairing potentials are zero has been inserted between the superconductors ( s ) and the exciton condensate ( ec ) . at the superconductor - normal interface",
    "an electron impinging from the normal region is perfectly reflected as a hole ( arrow c ) or , viceversa , a hole is reflected as an electron ( arrow a ) .",
    "current is conserved by emission / absorption of a cooper pair .",
    "this is the normal andreev reflection process . at the right side",
    "a similar but distinct process takes place .",
    "the exciton pairing potential has the effect of reflecting electrons and holes from one layer to the other ( arrows b and d ) .",
    "since real interlayer tunneling is absent the interlayer reflection is always accompanied by the emission of an exciton ( electron - hole pair ) .",
    "two excitons are emitted , one for the process b , and one for d. the wavefunctions for the complete path abcd can be matched only at a precise energy which depends on the various phases at play and is the energy of the excitonic andreev bound state ( eabs ) mentioned in the text .",
    "the process illustrated converts cooper pairs in the two superconductors into two excitons . ]",
    "we start our analysis from the long - junction limit , eq .  , where the superconducting gap is the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "the effect of the superconducting leads can be accounted for by means of proper boundary conditions . indeed in the deep subgap energy regime @xmath51 ,",
    "electrons impinging at the interface with the superconductor are totally andreev reflected with a reflection coefficient that is energy independent .",
    "the boundary conditions at the two interfaces @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the left and right moving fields [ introduced in eq .  ] were derived by maslov _",

    "@xcite and , for the present case , they read @xmath54 a convenient way to implement these boundary conditions is to perform a _ field folding _ , namely to express the fields @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 defined on an extension of the system to coordinate @xmath57 .",

    "we observe that @xmath82 behaves as @xmath85 while for @xmath86 tends to the heaviside step function , @xmath87 .",
    "we recall that the superconducting gap has been set as the largest energy scale in the problem and thus it does not appear in the expression for the current given in eqs . and . in the following",

    "this peculiar phase dependence has several interesting physical implications . when the top and bottom junctions are polarized with the same phase bias ( @xmath91 , parallel flow ) no supercurrents can flow through the ec .",
    "in this case the josephson currents experience an _",
    "exciton blockade_. in the opposite case of counterflow phase bias ( @xmath92 ) the josephson current flowing through the ec is maximal , with a critical value equal to _ half _ of the critical current of a ballistic one - channel superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( s - n - s ) junction .",
    "this is evidence of the fact that the four - terminal device allows supercurrent ( dissipationless ) drag .",
    "when current flows in one layer due to a phase bias in the same layer , a current equal in magnitude but opposite in direction flows in the other layer .",
    "this is a consequence of the perfect conversion of exciton current into supercurrent .",

    "note that this occurs even when the thermal length @xmath101 is smaller than the length @xmath2 of the junction .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the case of an s - n - s junction ( or with the case of two decoupled layers ) , where the critical current is exponentially suppressed@xcite . in the presence of the ec ,",
    "andreev reflection processes occurring coherently at the two interfaces transform cooper pairs into the electron - hole pairs of the ec , which are protected from thermal decoherence by the excitonic gap .",

    "( [ eq : optimalgamma])-([eq : phase_wind ] ) or  ( [ eq : optimalgamma])-([eq : winding ] ) ] . from the derivation given in appendix  [ app : bound ]",

    "this is the only way for a cooper pair to enter the condensate .",
    "the factor two in the denominator of the expression @xmath303 can be explained as following .",

    "the number of cooper pairs is not conserved and the state of the system is unchanged , _",
    "i.e. _ it has the same free energy and current . for our four - terminal junction",
    "this process is _ forbidden _ since the motion of a cooper pair in one layer must be balanced by a counterpropagating pair in the bottom layer . indeed , if we change @xmath200 to @xmath304 we put the junction in a different current state .",

    "thus the fact that the current is a @xmath164-periodic function of @xmath303 and not of _ e.g. _ @xmath94 is a consequence of the fact that electrons are transferred through such a hybrid junction in groups of four .",
    "the peculiar phase dependence we have found has several interesting physical implications .",

    "exciton blockade_. in the opposite case of counterflow phase bias ( @xmath306 ) the josephson current flowing through the ec is maximal , with a critical value equal to half the critical current of a ballistic one - channel s - n - s junction .",
    "the four - terminal device allows to realize a superdrag effect , _",
    "i.e. _ a drag of dissipationless currents .",
    "when current flows in one layer due to a phase bias applied to that layer , a current equal in magnitude but opposite in direction flows in the other layer .",
    "this is a consequence of perfect conversion of exciton current into supercurrent .    at finite temperatures ,",
    "as long as the ec gap is larger than @xmath307 the current is essentially unaffected by thermal fluctuations .",
    "note that this occurs even when the thermal length @xmath101 is smaller than the length @xmath2 of the junction .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the case of an ordinary s - n - s junction ( or with the case of two decoupled layers ) , where the critical current is exponentially suppressed  @xcite when @xmath308 , due to thermal decoherence affecting a single andreev - reflection process . in the presence of an ec ,",
    "andreev reflection processes coherently occurring at the two interfaces transform cooper pairs into electron - hole pairs of the ec , which are protected from thermal decoherence by the excitonic gap .",
    "thus in the temperature window @xmath309 the ec counterflow channel is responsible for an _ exponential enhancement _ of the critical current .",

    "moreover , the small distance between the carrier layers , the weaker dielectric screening , and the linearly - dispersive bands help to increase both interaction and disorder energy scales .",
    "furthermore , graphene bands are nearly perfectly particle - hole symmetric , guaranteeing the nesting between the fermi surfaces of the conduction and valence bands , and favoring the emergence of a coherent ec state .",
    "josephson currents flowing through graphene contacted to superconducting electrodes have already been observed by several groups  @xcite . for these reasons",
