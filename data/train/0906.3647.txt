    "figure  [ fig : floats ] shows the trajectories of ten floats released in the labrador sea , for a period of a few months .",
    "the principal reason to release such floats is the data they measure and transmit back  temperature , salinity , pressure , etc .",
    "but the actual trajectories of the floats are also important , since they tell us something about large - scale transport in the ocean , a crucial component in understanding global circulation . from a single float",
    "one can deduce the single - particle dispersion coefficient , a crude measure of how quickly a float wanders away from its release point .",
    "however , it is better to measure quantities that involve several floats  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if floats happen to start near each other , then we can see how quickly they separate and measure finite - time lyapunov exponents  @xcite , which are linked to chaotic advection  @xcite .",
    "but if the floats are nowhere near each other , then a more global quantity is needed . in this paper",
    "we propose to examine the ` braid ' defined by the trajectories and to measure their degree of entanglement .",
    "( all these terms will be defined more precisely . )",
    "the number we get out of this is called the braid s _ topological entropy_. figure  [ fig : floats_braid ] shows a measure of the entanglement of the ten floats as a function of time , with an exponential fit : the growth rate is the topological entropy .",
    "( for longer times , the curve levels off because floats start leaving the labrador sea , which is not really a closed system . )",
    "much like a lyapunov exponent , the topological entropy gives us a characteristic time for the entanglement of the floats in the labrador sea , here about  @xmath0 days .      since the original paper of boyland _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite , topological techniques in fluid dynamics have been applied to free point vortices  @xcite , fixed blinking vortex  @xcite , rod stirring devices  @xcite , and spatially - periodic systems  @xcite .",
    "( see  @xcite for a brief review . )",
    "more recently , the emphasis has shifted to locating periodic orbits that play an important role in stirring  @xcite  so - called _ ghost rods _  and even to the manufacture of such orbits  @xcite .",
    "most of these papers study periodic motions of rods or particle orbits .",
    "for many practical applications , however , periodic motion is not directly observable , since most such orbits are highly unstable .",
    "hence , some authors have examined _ random braids _",
    "@xcite composed of arbitrary chaotic trajectories .",
    "( there is also related literature from the knot theory perspective  see for example  @xcite . )",
    "the goal of the present paper is to give concrete techniques that can be used to obtain topological information from particle trajectories .",
    "the mathematical details are glossed over : the emphasis is on usability .",
    "implementation details are discussed , and some sample matlab programs are presented in an appendix .",
    "the hope is that this will make these techniques more accessible to those with little or no background in braid theory and topology .",
    "the principal measurement we extract from a braid is its topological entropy .",
    "this entropy is closely related to the traditional lyapunov exponent , except that being a topological quantity it is not sensitive to the size of the sets on which chaos is occurring .",
    "this is both a weakness and a strength : it does not tell us everything we might like to know , but on the other hand the topological entropy is easy to compute from crude data .",
    "this is in contrast to lyapunov exponents , which require at the very least detailed knowledge of particle trajectories that start close together , and at best the velocity field and its gradient .",
    "when dealing with , for example , data from oceanic floats ( as we will later in this paper ) , being able to compute a lyapunov exponent is a rarity .",
    "there is also a philosophical point that bears some discussion .",
    "the viewpoint of the present paper is that given particle trajectory data , a useful thing to quantify is how ` entangled ' the particle trajectories are .",
    "this can be done from the particle data directly , without worrying about the underlying flow . by contrast , lyapunov exponents are defined locally and are sensitive to the _ smooth structure _ of the flow .",
    "it is exactly the ( presumed ) smooth nature of the flow that connects local information to a global quantity such as the lyapunov exponent , but one is left wondering why we should care about the local picture at all in practical situations .",
    "the topological viewpoint presented here is an attempt to sidestep this and focus directly on global information .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : braids ] by a short introduction to braid theory , surface dynamics , and their connection to dynamical systems . in section  [ sec : braidsfromflow ] we show how to extract braids from particle trajectory data .",
    "section  [ sec : entropy ] is devoted to topological entropy : in section  [ sec : entrflow ] we discuss its connection to flows , and in section  [ sec : entrbraid ] we show how to measure it from a braid ( for a braid corresponding to periodic orbits ) . in section  [ sec : random ] we introduce random braids , and again show how to measure entropies . as an application",
    ", we calculate the entropy for floats in the labrador sea , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : floats_both ] .",
    "we offer some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "first we describe intuitively how braids arise .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbits ] shows the orbits of 4 particles in a circular two - dimensional domain .",
    "the particles might be fluid elements , solutions of ordinary differential equations , or physical particles at the surface of a fluid .",
    "figure  [ fig : orbits_braid ] shows the ` world line ' of the same orbits : they are plotted in a three - dimensional graph , with time flowing vertically upwards .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_braid ] depicts a _ physical braid _ , made up of four strands .",
    "no strand can go through another strand as a consequence of the deterministic motion of the particles ( they never occupy the same point at the same time ) .",
    "moreover , the mathematical definition of a braid requires that strands can not ` loop back ' : here this simply means that the particles can not travel back in time .",
    "we will say that two braids are equivalent if they can be deformed into each other with no strand crossing other strands or boundaries . throughout this paper",
    ", we will be interested in characterizing the level of ` entanglement ' of trajectories .",
    "since we can move the strands , is convenient to draw braids in a normalized form , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] for the braid in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_braid ] .",
    "such a picture is called a _",
    "braid diagram_. the important thing is that we record when crossings occur , and which particle was behind and which was in front .",
    "it matters little how we define ` behind , ' as long as we are consistent ( see section  [ sec : braidsfromflow ] for practical considerations ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] the horizontal dashed lines also suggest that we can divide the braid into a sequence of elementary crossings , known as _ generators_. figure  [ fig : sigmas ] shows the definition     +    of  @xmath1 , which denotes the clockwise interchange of the @xmath2th and @xmath3th strands , keeping all other strands fixed .",
    "note that the index  @xmath2 is the position of the strand from left to right , _ not _ a label for the particular strand . for  @xmath4 strands",
    ", we have  @xmath5 distinct generators .    figure  [ fig : sigmas ] also shows the counterclockwise interchange of two strands , denoted by the operation  @xmath6 .",
    "the justification of the ` inverse ' notation is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : inverses ] : if we concatenate  @xmath1 and  @xmath6 , then after pulling tight on the strands we find that they are disentangled .",
    "we call the braid on the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : inverses ] the _ identity braid_. in fact , the set of all braids on a given number  @xmath4 of strands forms a _ group _ in the mathematical sense : the group operation is given by concatenation of strands , the inverse by reversing the order and direction of crossings , the identity is as described above , and it is clear that concatenation is associative .",
    "this group is called  @xmath7 , the braid group on  @xmath4 strands , also known as the artin braid group .",
    "the braid group  @xmath7 is generated by the set  @xmath8 : this means that any braid in  @xmath7 can be written as a product ( concatenation ) of  @xmath1 s and their inverses .",
    "the braid group is _ finitely - generated _ , even though it is itself infinite : only a finite number of generators give the whole group . to see that the braid group contains an infinite number of braids , simply consider  @xmath9 , for  @xmath10 an arbitrary integer : no matter how large  @xmath10 gets , we always get a new braid out of this , consisting of increasingly twisted first and second strands .",
    "we have now passed from physical braids , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_braid ] , to _ algebraic braids_. the algebraic braid corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] is  @xmath11 , where we read generators from left to right in time ( beware : conventions differ ) .",
    "in essence , an algebraic braid is simply a sequence of generators , which may or may not come from a physical braid . how can we guarantee that physical braids and algebraic braids describe the same group ?",
    "we need to be mindful of _ relations _ amongst the generators that arise because of physical constraints .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : relation1 ] shows a relation amongst adjacent triplets of strands .",
    "+    staring at the picture long enough , and allowing for the deformation of strands without crossing , the reader can perhaps see the that braids in fig .",
    "[ fig : relation1 ] are indeed equal .",
    "hence , the algebraic sequence  @xmath12 must be equal to  @xmath13 , if the generators are to correspond to physical braids .",
    "another , more intuitive relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relation2 ] : generators commute if they do not share a strand . in summary , we have the relations    @xmath14    [ eq : presentation ]    amongst the generators .",
    "artin  @xcite proved the surprising fact that there are no other relations satisfied by the generators  @xmath1 , except for those than can be derived from   by basic group operations ( multiplication , inversion , etc . ) .",
    "the generators  @xmath8 together with the relations   define the _ algebraic braid group _ , which we also denote  @xmath7 . with these relations ,",
    "the groups of physical and algebraic braids are isomorphic .",
    "a consequence of the relations   is that it may not be immediately obvious that two algebraic braids are equal .",
    "for instance , the braids  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 are equal , since @xmath17 this ` braid equality ' problem has seen many refinements : the original solution of artin  @xcite has computational complexity exponential in the number of generators , but modern techniques can determine equality in a time quadratic in the braid length  @xcite .",
    "the first step in obtaining useful topological information from particle trajectories is to compute their associated braid , essentially going from the physical picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits_braid ] to the algebraic picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] . a simple method to do this",
    "was originally described in  @xcite , but is also implicit in earlier work such as  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a related technique ) .",
    "we start with trajectory information for  @xmath4 particles over some time .",
    "we first project the position of the particles onto any fixed _",
    "projection line _ ( which we choose to be the horizontal axis ) , and label the particles by  @xmath18 in increasing order of their projection .",
    "a crossing occurs whenever two particles interchange position on the projection line .",
    "a crossing can occur as an `` over '' or `` under '' braid , which for us means a clockwise or counterclockwise interchange .",
    "these interchanges correspond to the braid group generators introduced in section  [ sec : braidgroups ] .",
    "assuming a crossing has occurred between the @xmath2th and @xmath3th particles , we need to determine if the corresponding braid generator is  @xmath1 or  @xmath6 .",
    "we look at the projection of the @xmath2th and  @xmath3th particles in the direction perpendicular to the projection line ( the vertical axis in our case ) .",
    "if the @xmath2th particle is _ above _ the  @xmath3th at the time of crossing , then the interchange involves the group generator  @xmath1 ( we define `` above '' as having a greater value of projection along the perpendicular direction ) .",
    "conversely , if the @xmath2th particle is _ below _",
    "the  @xmath3th at the time of crossing , then the interchange involves the group generator  @xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig : crossinga ] depicts these two situations .",
    "the net result is that from the  @xmath4 particle trajectories we obtain a time - ordered sequence of the generators  @xmath1 and  @xmath6 , @xmath19 .",
    "we call this sequence the braid of the trajectories .",
    "we also record the times at which crossings occur , so each generator in the sequence has a time associated with it .",
    "* remarks : *    * the method just described might seem to detect spurious crossings if two well - separated particles just happen to interchange position on the projection line several consecutive times in a row , as shown in figure  [ fig : crossingb ] . however , this would imply a sequence of  @xmath1 and  @xmath6 braid generators , since which particle is the  @xmath2th one changes at each crossing . when composed together",
    "the generators for these crossings cancel .",
    "* we give a simple matlab implementation of the method in appendix  [ code : gencross ] .",
    "the program  ` gencross ` detects crossings in trajectory data ; it makes an effort to resolve multiple simultaneous crossings ( up to triple crossings ) , but will complain if it gets confused .",
    "more sophisticated code can be written that re - interpolates the trajectory as needed to detect crossings . * when the system has symmetries , such as when several periodic orbits lie on the same line , there are ` bad ' choices of projection line where it is impossible to resolve the order of crossings , since orbits cross at exactly the same time . displacing the projection line a little cures this .",
    "* if the braid is truly periodic , that is , if all the particles return to their initial configuration , then changing the projection line changes the braid , but only by _ conjugation _ , which does not affect the entropy  @xcite ( section  [ sec : entropy ] ) . *",
    "if the trajectories are not periodic , then the method does not define a braid in the traditional sense where all the strands return to the same initial configuration .",
    "this is inconsequential to our purposes : all that matters is the order along the projection line ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of projection line changes the braid beyond simple conjugation , but this only creates an error in a small , finite number of generators , which is not important when considering long braids and does not asymptotically affect the entropy ( section  [ sec : entropy ] ) . *",
    "if the braid is generated from chaotic trajectories , then missing a few crossings ( due to , say , gaps in the data ) is fine as long as the trajectories are long enough .",
    "in section [ sec : braids ] we described how a set of trajectories in the two - dimensional dynamical system can be described as a braid in a three - dimensional space - time diagram . in this section",
    "we will describe further how this braid relates to topological information for the underlying flow .",
    "it is worth noting that braids are not always interpreted in terms of trajectories : they arose first and are still studied as independent geometrical and algebraic objects .",
    "the reason they take center stage in the present study is through their connection to mappings of surfaces ( mapping class groups ) .",
    "the thurston ",
    "nielsen theory  @xcite classifies mapping of surfaces according to whether they can be `` deformed '' to each other in a topological sense .",
    "braids provide a convenient way of labeling the _ isotopy classes _ that result .",
    "so even though we will often speak here of the braid as being the primary object of interest , we are really using techniques that apply to the class of mappings labeled by a braid .",
    "ultimately , we want to measure the topological entropy of a system directly from a braid of trajectories . before we do this",
    ", we discuss the meaning of topological entropy of a flow or map .",
    "the topological entropy of a dynamical system measures the loss of information under the dynamics . it is closely related to the lyapunov exponent , which measures the time - asymptotic rate of separation of neighboring trajectories .",
    "but it is in some sense a cruder quantity , since it does not require a notion of distance .",
    "a positive entropy is associated with chaos , though it tells us nothing about the size of the chaotic region .",
    "the topological entropy is an upper bound on the largest lyapunov exponent of a flow .",
    "the two are equal only for very simple systems where stretching is uniform .",
    "though there are more fundamental ways to define it , we shall take our working definition of entropy to be the",
    "_ asymptotic growth rate of material lines _",
    "it is fairly straightforward to measure this numerically , given a sufficiently accurate velocity field .",
    "we simply choose an initial material line and follow it for some time , interpolating new        points as the line gets longer .",
    "figure  [ fig : linestretch ] shows such a line for a numerical simulation of a stirred viscous flow .",
    "note how the exponential growth rate is very sharply defined .",
    "the topological entropy is the supremum of the growth rate over all such loops , but in practice almost any nontrivial loop ( _ i.e. _ , that spans the domain ) will grow exponentially at a rate  @xmath20 .    in practical applications we often do not have access to an accurate representation of the velocity field .",
    "this is where braids come in , as a way of approximating the topological entropy . as we will see in section  [ sec : entrbraid ] , the braid provides a lower bound on the flow s topological entropy .",
    "figure  [ fig : s1s-2_loop ] illustrates how the motion of  @xmath21 point particles can be used to put a lower bound on the topological entropy , defined here as the growth rate of material lines or loops .",
    "particles , a loop is initially wrapped around the second and third particles . the generator  @xmath22 is applied , interchanging clockwise the first and second particles , followed by  @xmath23 , which interchanges the second and third particles counterclockwise .",
    "the loop is forced to stretch under this application .",
    "the final loop on the lower right underwent two applications of the braid  @xmath24 .",
    "if we keep applying this braid , the length of the loop will grow exponentially . ]    here , the point particles undergo a motion described by the braid  @xmath24 .",
    "two full periods are shown .",
    "notice that an initial loop that is ` caught ' on the particles is forced to follow along , since determinism implies that it can not occupy the same point in phase space as the particles .",
    "in fact , a straightforward calculation  @xcite shows that for this braid the total length of the loop must grow exponentially at least at a rate  @xmath25 per period .",
    "we call this rate the _ topological entropy of the braid _ , @xmath26 , to distinguish it from the true topological entropy of the flow , @xmath20 , as defined in section  [ sec : entrflow ]",
    ". we have @xmath27 for any braid obtained from the motion of  @xmath4 particles in the flow .",
    "typically , the more particles are included in the braid , the closer  @xmath26 is to  @xmath20  @xcite . note that  @xmath28 and  @xmath29 are always zero .",
    "an essential property of  @xmath26 is that the growth _ rate _ of the loop is independent of specific details : for instance , if the particles are not equally spaced , or if the loop is ` tightened ' around the particles , then the length will change , but the asymptotic growth rate will not , because all these changes amount to an additive constant in the logarithm , which gets divided by a large time .",
    "we are now faced with a task : given a sequence of generators  @xmath1 , measured in some way or obtained numerically from a flow , what is  @xmath26 ?",
    "the method used in  @xcite , based on a matrix representation of the braid group , only provides a lower bound on the braid entropy .",
    "an accurate and efficient computation has since become a lot simpler due to a new algorithm by moussafir  @xcite , who uses a set of coordinates to encode a loop .",
    "we describe this briefly below ; for more details see  @xcite .",
    "the reader who is mostly interested in using the method can skip to the end of the section to procedure  [ proc:1 ] .",
    "the basic idea is simple : consider the closed loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynn_loop ] , which is wrapped around  @xmath30 particles .     particles . up to trivial deformations ,",
    "the loop can be reconstructed by counting intersections with the vertical lines . in terms of the crossing numbers defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynn_def ] , this loop has  @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and dynnikov coordinate vector  @xmath38 ( see eq .  ) . ]",
    "the loop does not intersect itself , so in two dimensions the allowable paths it can follow around the particles are far from arbitrary .",
    "the amazing fact is that we can reconstruct the entire loop , or at least the way it is threaded around the particles , by counting how many times it intersects the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynn_loop ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynn_def ] we give specific labels to the     and  @xmath39 .",
    "the  @xmath40 for  @xmath2 odd count crossings above a particle , and below a particle for  @xmath2 even . the  @xmath39 count crossings between particles .",
    "]    _ crossing numbers_. for  @xmath4 particles , @xmath41 ( odd index ) gives the number of crossings of a loop above the  @xmath2th particle , and  @xmath42 ( even index ) below the same particle .",
    "the number  @xmath39 counts the crossings between particle  @xmath2 and  @xmath43 .",
    "we have a total of  @xmath44 crossing numbers .",
    "this set of crossing numbers ( which are all non - negative ) can be reduced further : define @xmath45 for  @xmath46 .",
    "the vector of length  @xmath47 , @xmath48 is called the _ dynnikov coordinates _ of a loop .",
    "( as far as we know , this specific encoding was originally introduced by dynnikov  @xcite , but it is implicit in earlier work of thurston , dehn , and others . ) the components  @xmath49 and  @xmath50 are signed integers .",
    "they can be used to exactly reconstruct the loop  @xcite , but we shall not need to do this here .",
    "this set of coordinates is minimal : it is not possible to achieve the same reconstruction with fewer numbers .",
    "we can also obtain the minimum number of intersections  @xmath51 of the loop with the horizontal line through the particles  @xcite : @xmath52 where  @xmath53 and  @xmath54 can be obtained from the other coordinates as  @xcite @xmath55 the formula for  @xmath51 is encoded in the matlab function ` loopinter ` in appendix  [ code : loopsigma ] .",
    "for example , the loop in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynn_loop ] intersects the horizontal axis ( the line through all the particles ) 12 times .",
    "the crucial observation , which will allow a simple computation of  @xmath26 , is that if the length of the loop grow exponentially , then  @xmath51 also grows exponentially at the same rate  @xcite .    now that we have a way of encoding any loop , we need to find how the loop is transformed by a braid .",
    "what makes all this work is that there is a very efficient way of doing this : given a loop encoded by  @xmath56 as in eq .",
    ", each generator of the braid group  @xmath1 simply transforms these coordinates in a predetermined manner .",
    "( mathematically , this defines an _ action _ of the braid group on the set of dynnikov coordinates . )",
    "we call these transformations the _ update rules _ for a generator",
    ".    the update rules are straightforward to code on a computer .",
    "( see appendix  [ code : loopsigma ] for a matlab implementation . ) to express them succinctly , as clockwise interchanges rather than counterclockwise . ]",
    "first define for a quantity  @xmath57 the operators @xmath58 after we define @xmath59 we can express the update rules for the  @xmath1 acting on  @xmath60 as    @xmath61    [ eq : ur ]    for  @xmath62 . for this and the following update rules , all the other unlisted components of  @xmath56",
    "are unchanged under the action of  @xmath1 or  @xmath6 .",
    "the leftmost ( @xmath63 ) and rightmost ( @xmath64 ) generators require special treatment , having update rules    @xmath65    [ eq : ur1 ]    for  @xmath22 , and    @xmath66    [ eq : urn ]    for  @xmath67 .",
    "we need to give separate update rules for the generators  @xmath6 . with the definition @xmath68",
    "the update rules for the  @xmath6 are    @xmath69    [ eq : iur ]    for  @xmath62 .",
    "we also have    @xmath70    [ eq : iur1 ]    for  @xmath71 , and    @xmath72    [ eq : iurn ]    for  @xmath73 .    update rules of this form are known as _ piecewise - linear _ : once the mins and maxes are resolved , what is left is simply a linear operation .",
    "however , the mins and maxes are what keeps this from being a simple linear algebra problem and make the braid dynamics so rich .    here then is a recipe for computing  @xmath26 , the topological entropy of a braid of @xmath4 particle trajectories :    * remarks : *    * the procedure above assumes that the braid is _ periodic _ , _ i.e. _ , is obtained from periodic orbits of the flow . in section  [ sec : random ] we will discuss how the method differs for random braids obtained from sampling arbitrary trajectories ( which do nt necessarily repeat ) . * the dimension of  @xmath26 is inverse time , where the unit of time is the period over which the braid is repeated . *",
    "even though the discussion so far has described  @xmath56 as a vector of integers , the initial condition for  @xmath56 in step  [ item:1 ] can in practice be chosen to be a random set of real numbers .",
    "( this called a  _ projectivized _ version of the coordinates  @xcite . )",
    "* as is typical of such exponential growth calculation , it is possible that the components of  @xmath56 becomes so large that they overflow double - precision arithmetic .",
    "in that case standards ` renormalization ' techniques can be used : divide  @xmath56 by a large constant  @xmath74 , but keep track of how many times this division was done . then add that multiple of  @xmath75 to the logarithm in step  [ item:5 ] .",
    "another option is to use real or integer arbitrary precision arithmetic , but this slows down the calculation .",
    "* we stress that moussafir s technique for the computation of a braid s entropy is extremely rapid compared to previous methods , which typically use _ train tracks _ and the bestvina ",
    "handel algorithm  @xcite , or combinatorial methods  @xcite .",
    "the rapidity arises from the fact that the algorithm keeps a bare minimum of information ( the vector  @xmath56 ) to express the topology of an arbitrarily long curve .",
    "the bestvina  handel algorithm , however , gives more information about the braid ( such as the existence of invariant curves ",
    "see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",

    "from the point of view of data analysis , looking at periodic braid is not general enough .",
    "most periodic orbits in a dynamical system are unstable , and thus they can not be detected directly .",
    "the trajectories we have access to are typically chaotic .",
    "nevertheless , we can ask what the braid corresponding to a set of orbits tells us about a dynamical system .",
    "the answer is that its entropy approximates the ` true ' topological entropy of the flow , and the approximation gets better as more particles are added .",
    "there are two ways to analyze random braids generated by chaotic trajectories : without and with ensemble averaging . ` without averaging ' means that we have a single realization to study , say  @xmath4 trajectories integrated or measured up to some final time .",
    "unless the final time is extremely long , this is not very accurate . ` with averaging '",
    "means that we have the luxury of repeating the experiment several times , following the same number of trajectories at each realization ( assuming the flow is the same for each realization , at least in a statistical sense ) .",
    "we then average over the total number of realizations of the experiment , in the manner described below .",
    "let us first describe the procedure without averaging : we assume that we have obtained a sequence of generators from the trajectories of  @xmath4 particles , as well as the time at which each crossing occurs ( see section  [ sec : braidsfromflow ] ) . in the examples presented here ,",
    "those trajectories were either computed from randomly - selected initial conditions , or they were obtained from measured data ( the oceanic floats ) .    * remarks : *    * since the braid is random , we must keep track of the time when crossings occur . *",

    "note that the integration time is quite long , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : blinking_random ]  @xmath51 becomes enormous .",
    "for such long integration time , the fit for the entropy is good .      to get",
    "a more accurate measurement of  @xmath26 for random braids , ensemble averaging is desirable , if we have that luxury . to implement this",
    ", we integrate a set of  @xmath4 trajectories  @xmath76 times , randomizing the initial condition for each realization .",
    "we obtain a list of  @xmath77 trajectories for times  @xmath78 , from which we compute  @xmath76 braids and vectors of crossing times .",
    "to do the averaging , we need to be able to compare  @xmath51 at the same times for each braid , but since crossings occur at different times we can not do this directly .",
    "we instead break up the total time interval into equal subintervals of length  @xmath79 , and for each subinterval and each realization we record  @xmath51 up to time  @xmath80 , where  @xmath81 is an integer with  @xmath82 .",
    "we finally obtain  @xmath76 lists of  @xmath83 $ ] ( square brackets denote the integer part ) intersection numbers  @xmath51 , all sampled at the same times corresponding to each subinterval .",
    "the whole procedure is summarized as :    * remarks : *    * we average  @xmath84 rather than  @xmath51 : not only does this ensure that procedures  [ proc:2 ] and  [ proc:3 ] give the same entropy , but it also leads to smaller fluctuations .",
    "* for best results , the number of subintervals  @xmath83 $ ] has to be large enough to get a good fit , but small enough that there are several crossings within each subinterval of length  @xmath79 .",

    "an explicit example in matlab ( for the duffing oscillator ) is given in appendix  [ code : proc3_example ] .",
    "as a more practical application of random braids , we consider data for oceanic floats in the labrador sea ( north atlantic )  @xcite , discussed in the introduction ( section  [ sec : intro_floats ] ) .",
    "the position of ten floats for a few months is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : floats ] .",
    "note that the float trajectories seem more entangled while they are confined to the labrador sea ( between greenland and labrador ) , and some eventually escape . to compute the braid ,",
    "we linearly interpolate the float positions to determine when crossings occur between the  @xmath90 floats .",
    "we then use procedure  [ proc:2 ] to compute the entropy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : floats_braid ] , since ensemble averaging is not available here ( we only have data for one experiment ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : floats_braid ] that  @xmath51 has a convincing exponential regime for about 150 days , after which floats tend to escape the labrador sea and  @xmath51 reaches a plateau .",
    "the entropy gives us a timescale for the entanglement of floats in the labrador sea , here about  @xmath91 days .",
    "this number is easy to obtain from the raw data : there is no need for a model of the velocity field .",
    "however , the trajectories need to be long enough for a significant number of crossings to occur , and localized enough for particles to actually braid .    more context will be needed to fully understand what it means to say that the timescale for entanglement is 50 days .",
    "for instance , the method could be benchmarked by following tracers in simulations of flows comparable to the labrador sea , in which braids can be easily computed .",
    "the measure is also useful for comparing different regions of the ocean .",
    "note that there has been previous work on bounding the topological entropy of experimental data .",
    "@xcite have obtained lower bounds on entropy and evidence of chaotic behavior in a nonstationary optical system .",
    "see also the review by @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to interpret the data obtained from braids of particles .",
    "the first is to accumulate data for enough particle trajectories that a good approximation to the topological entropy  @xmath20 is obtained .",
    "the drawback to this is that the convergence of  @xmath26 to  @xmath20 as  @xmath4 gets larger appears to be fairly slow  @xcite , though more work is needed to determine this convergence rate . in this interpretation ,",
    "the braid approach is seen as a practical way of measuring  @xmath20 .",
    "this interpretation is in the same spirit as a lyapunov exponent .",
    "its main advantage is that a single number is easy to comprehend and compare ; its main drawback is that a single number does nt capture the subtleties of a particular system .",
    "the second interpretation is to regard  @xmath26 as the ` @xmath4-particle braiding time , ' in a similar fashion that  @xmath4-particle correlation functions are measured .",
    "thus , the behavior of  @xmath26 with  @xmath4 carries real information , as it tells us the typical time for 3 particle trajectories to become entangled , then 4 particles , etc .",
    "we might call this the ` spectrum of braid entropies ' for a dynamical system .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it requires a more careful analysis of the data .",
    "the method presented in this paper is limited to two - dimensional flows .",
    "indeed , a four - dimensional braid of three - dimensional particles trajectories is not very useful , as this and all higher - dimensional braid groups are trivial ( strands can always be disentangled without crossing  @xcite ) .",
    "the best alternative is to lift the trajectories of material lines to sheets in four dimensions , but this presents some daunting visualization challenges , and there is little developed theory ( but see  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the topological entropy  @xmath26 is only the crudest piece of information that can be extracted from a braid .",
    "many other types of invariants can be computed  @xcite . however",
    ", those invariants do nt necessarily have a clear interpretation in terms of dynamics .",
    "a promising avenue for obtaining much more precise information on a dynamical system is to find the isotopy class of the random braid ( see section  [ sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "this would tell us , for instance , whether some floats merely orbit each other and thus behave as one ` trajectory ' from the point of view of braiding and entropy .",
    "this is akin to making a braid out of thick rope : even though each rope is made up of tiny strands , these contribute to the braid as one large strand .",
    "this sort of approach could help to identify lagrangian coherent structures from particle trajectory data , by looking for decomposable braids .",
    "however , the tools available to do this , such as the bestvina  handel algorithm  @xcite , are still slow and difficult to use on large braids .",
    "a promising approach was recently used in  @xcite , but needs to be developed further .",
