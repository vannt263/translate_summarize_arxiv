    "<S> having established the thermal origin of the baseline resistance and the anisotropy , we use this 3d - fem to explore the asymmetry ( @xmath72 ) observed in the hanle measurement at 300  k. a finite component of the heat current in the py bar at the detector junction flowing along the length of the al channel , combined with the py magnetization pointing in the out - of - plane direction , generates a transversal voltage along the main axis of the py bar due to the the anomalous nernst effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this transversal voltage gives rise to the asymmetry observed in the hanle measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully account for @xmath72 by considering an anomalous nernst coefficient of py equal to 0.06 , a factor of two smaller than obtained earlier in py / cu spin valves @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetothermoelectric effects here described are general phenomena in hanle experiments . </S>",
    "<S> note that the use of tunnel interfaces in previous studies @xcite enhances the spin signal by about 100 times , but from our thermal model that would only amount to an enhancement of the thermoelectric response by a factor of 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to understand why the anisotropic signatures have not been identified in previous studies , as the thermoelectric response would only be a modulation of approximately 1% relative to the spin dependent hanle signal in those studies . in this work , with transparent contacts and at room temperature , </S>",
