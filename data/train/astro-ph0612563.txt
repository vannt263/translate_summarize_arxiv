    "a high - mass star can arrive on the main - sequence completely enshrouded in dust and inaccessible to optical studies .",
    "thus , the ability to penetrate high extinction is crucial to exploring the earliest stages of high - mass star formation .",
    "infrared , radio , and millimeter observations have traditionally been used and provide important information on physical conditions in circumstellar disks and envelopes or in ionized winds or hii regions around the massive young star .",
    "x - ray observations can also penetrate high extinction and provide a different perspective that probes high - energy processes including magnetic activity originating close to the stellar surface , mass - loss as traced by shocked winds , jets , or outflows , and hot diffuse gas that pervades some young clusters containing massive young ob stars with powerful winds .",
    "one of the closest regions known to contain young high - mass stars is the infrared cluster near the optical reflection nebula ngc 2071 in the orion b region ( lynds 1630 dark cloud ) at a distance of @xmath2400 pc ( anthony - twarog 1982 ; brown et al .",

    "the presence of strong ionizing uv radiation and maser emission strongly suggests that these objects are young embedded early - type stars .",
    "such objects are exceedingly rare at distances less than 500 pc and the ngc 2071 cluster thus plays a key role in observational studies of high - mass star formation .",
    "we report here on first results of a pointed x - ray observation of ngc 2071 obtained with _ xmm - newton_. this observation is centered on the ngc 2071-ir subgroup and provides broader energy coverage and improved spectral information compared to two previous rosat hri exposures ( rh202521/22 ) which captured the ir subgroup @xmath18@xmath4 - 10@xmath4 off - axis .",

    "the pn spectrum reveals a faint fe k emission line and spectral fits with an absorbed two - temperature optically thin plasma model require a hot component at kt@xmath6 @xmath1 3.5 - 5 kev as commonly seen in magnetically active t tauri stars .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the source that we associate with ngc 2071-irs1 is unusual compared to the optically thin plasma spectra typically seen in young stellar objects .",
    "as figure 7 shows , the spectrum is characterized by a nearly flat broad - band continuum that is heavily absorbed below @xmath11 kev and a strong broad emission line from neutral or near - neutral iron near 6.4 kev .",
    "the fluorescent fe line dominates the spectrum and its intensity and width are exceptional for a young stellar object .",
    "the spectrum in figure 7 was extracted using a circular region of radius r@xmath8 = 15@xmath0 and may include contributions from the nearby sources irs-2 , irs-3 , and irs-5 , which lie at offsets of 5.@xmath06 - 11.@xmath04 from irs-1",

    "the positions of irs-2 , irs-3 , and irs-5 lie outside this smaller circle and even though there could be some psf overlap these results suggest that irs-1 ( or an as yet unresolved source within a few arcseconds of irs-1 ) is the dominant x - ray contributor .",
    "we attempted to fit the spectrum using a conventional optically thin plasma model with a single absorption component plus a gaussian line near 6.4 kev .",
    "this model ran away to unphysically high temperatures even when multiple temperature components were allowed .",
    "however , we were able to fit the spectrum with either ( i ) an absorbed power - law continuum with a photon power - law index @xmath24 = @xmath100.55 plus a gaussian line centered at e@xmath25 = 6.48 kev ( @xmath19/dof = 14.3/14 ) or ( ii ) a two - component optically thin plasma model with a cool moderately absorbed component and a hot heavily - absorbed component plus a gaussian line centered at e@xmath25 = 6.43 kev ( @xmath19/dof = 10.7/11 ) .",
    "fit results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "both the power - law and thermal fits are formally acceptable but the thermal model provides a better fit of the shape of the spectrum at lower energies between 1 - 2 kev and is easier to justify on physical grounds .",
    "also , the x - ray absorption log n@xmath13 = 22.0 @xmath14 determined from the power - law model corresponds to a visual extinction a@xmath26 = 4.5 mag ( gorenstein 1975 ) , which is much less than the range a@xmath26 @xmath1 28 - 51 mag expected toward irs-1 if it is an embedded b0 - b5 star ( wa93 ) .",
    "the thermal model yields higher absorptions that are consistent with the range expected for irs-1 .",
    "however , we do consider the possibility of power - law models further in section 5 .    high ( but physically realisitic ) x - ray temperatures are required by the two - component thermal model to reproduce the broad - band continuum ( table 2 ) .",
    "the absorption inferred for the hot component at kt@xmath6 = 10.8 kev is log n@xmath27 = 23.2 @xmath14 .",
    "this n@xmath27 implies an equivalent visual extinction a@xmath26 @xmath1 70 mag ( gorenstein 1975 ) .",
    "thus , the high - temperature source is heavily obscured .",
    "the absorption associated with the cooler component at kt@xmath15 = 0.7 kev is log n@xmath28 = 22.6 @xmath14 , or a@xmath26 @xmath1 17 mag .",
    "the strong fe line accounts for @xmath130% of the observed ( absorbed ) flux in the 0.5 - 7.5 kev range .",
    "the gaussian line width deduced from the thermal model @xmath29 = 140 ev gives fwhm = 330 ev .",
    "the line is quite likely resolved since the pn intrinsic energy resolution is fwhm @xmath1 160 ev at 6.5 kev .      the physical picture needed to explain the fluorescent fe emission requires the presence of neutral or near - neutral material in proximity to the x - ray source .",
    "this material is irradiated by the hard source , which is quite likely the embedded high - mass star .",
    "the origin of the line broadening is clearly of interest .",
    "velocity broadening of a single line can not fully account for the line width without invoking unrealistically high velocities .",
    "some of the broadening could be due to multiple closely - spaced fe lines that are not spectrally distinguishable at the pn energy resolution . in this",
    "regard , inspection of the unfolded spectral model shows that a fainter fe k line may contribute to some of the flux near 6.7 kev but this line , if present , is masked by the broad wings of the 6.43 kev fluorescent line .",
    "if the broad fluorescent line width is a column density effect then the inferred column density is large .",
    "the line equivalent width ( ew ) is related to the column density of cold fluorescent material in the optically thin slab approximation by ew @xmath1 2.3 n@xmath30 kev ( kallman 1995 ) , where n@xmath30 is the column density of the cold matter in units of 10@xmath31 @xmath14 . in the present case ,",
    "our pn spectrum measurements give ew = 2.4 kev so n@xmath32 @xmath2 10@xmath33 @xmath14 .",
    "the lower signal - to - noise ratio mos spectra give a somewhat smaller value ew = 1.4 kev or n@xmath32 @xmath2 10@xmath34 @xmath14 . the value determined from the pn spectrum is at the upper limit where kallman s approximation breaks down but",
    "if the 6.43 kev feature is a blend then the inferred value of n@xmath32 is only an upper limit .",
    "the above approximation indicates that the absorption column of the cold material is about an order of magnitude greater than the absorption inferred for the hard thermal x - ray component ( table 2 ) .",
    "the material responsible for absorption of the hard x - rays can not fully account for n@xmath32 ( see also eq . [ 4 ] of tsujimoto et al . 2005 ) .",
    "thus , the cold fluoresced material may not lie directly on the line - of - sight .",
    "one possibility is that the fluorescent line originates in the dense ridge of molecular gas orthogonal to the outflow axis which may be a rotating disk ( bally 1982 ; seth , greenhill , & holder 2002 ) .",
    "fluorescent fe line analysis similar to that above has been undertaken on ysos in other high - mass star - forming regions .",
    "of particular relevance is the _ chandra _ study of the sgr b2 giant molecular cloud by takagi , murakami , & koyama ( 2002 ) , who reported high - temperature plasma and strong 6.4 kev line emission for some luminous x - ray sources .",
    "specifically , they obtained kt @xmath1 10 kev and a fluorescent fe line equivalent width ew = 630 ( 180 - 1100 ; 90% confidence ) ev for sgr b2 source 10 ( cxo j174720.2@xmath35282305 ) .",
    "takagi et al .",
    "note that this x - ray source lies near an ultracompact hii region and may correspond to a massive yso .",
    "the x - ray temperature reported for sgr b2 source 10 is similar to what we infer for the hot component of ngc 2071 irs1 , but the fluorescent line equivalent width and derived value of n@xmath32 is @xmath13 - 4 times larger for irs1 .",
    "the unusual x - ray spectrum of the source near the massive young star irs-1 warrants further discussion .",
    "the presence of cool and hot plasma components apparently seen through different absorption columns suggests that more than one source or x - ray emission process contributes to the spectrum .",
    "we consider possible emission processes below .",
    "the need to invoke two thermal x - ray components at different absorption columns to fit x - ray spectra has also recently been seen in some accreting _ low - mass _ pre - main sequence stars such as the t tauri star dg tau a ( gdel et al . 2005 ) .",
    "high - resolution _ chandra _ images reveal a two - component x - ray source consisting of a relatively hard strongly - absorbed point source at the stellar position and softer less - absorbed x - ray emission extending along a bipolar jet several arcseconds from the star . the jet is also seen in the optical .",
    "spectral extractions centered on the star capture emission from both components , resulting in a double - absorption spectrum .",
    "some of the softer emission is due to the shocked jet while the harder point - like emission at the position of dg tau a is undoubtedly of magnetic origin .",
    "it is conceivable that a similar phenomenon could be responsible for the double - absorption x - ray spectrum detected here for irs-1 .",
    "it is unavoidable that our spectral extraction captures a rather large region around the x - ray source and could sample shocked wind or outflow emission that is offset by several arc - seconds from the central source . at d = 400 pc ,",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ psf ( fwhm @xmath1 4.@xmath03 ) corresponds to fwhm @xmath1 1700 au and our nominal source extraction radius r@xmath8 = 15@xmath0 corresponds to a radius of 6000 au ( 0.03 pc ) .",
    "the velocity of the bipolar molecular outflow ( @xmath170 km s@xmath36 ; bally 1982 ) is too low to produce shock - heated plasma at the temperatures inferred from the x - ray spectral fits .",
    "however , a higher velocity stellar wind or jet could suffice .",
    "the presence of a compact hii region and luminosity considerations suggest that irs-1 may be an embedded @xmath2b0 - b5 star ( wa93 ) which could indeed have already developed a strong wind .",
    "also , irs-3 lies within our r@xmath8 = 15@xmath0 extraction region and it is known to have a radio jet ( torreles et al .",
    "1998 ) .    simple shock - heating models ( krolik & raymond 1985 ; raga et al .",
    "2002 ) give a predicted shock temperature t@xmath9 @xmath1 1.5 @xmath5 10@xmath37(@xmath38/100 km s@xmath36)@xmath39",
    "k , where @xmath38 is the shock speed relative to the upstream flow . in order to reach x - ray temperatures comparable to that of the cool x - ray component t@xmath15 = 8.7 [ 2.3 - 11.6 ] mk ( table 2 ) , shock speeds @xmath38 @xmath1 760 [ 390 - 880 ] km s@xmath36 would be required .",
    "these are fast shocks but perhaps within reason if irs-1 is an embedded early b - type star .",
    "the above shock speed is only about half the terminal wind speed of a b3 v star and about one - third that of a b0 v star ( table 4 of cassinelli et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "x - rays from radiation - driven wind shocks in early - type stars are predicted on theoretical grounds ( lucy 1982 ; lucy & white 1980 ) .",
    "the expected x - ray temperatures are @xmath161 kev so this process could at best account only for the cooler plasma seen in the two - component spectrum . however , the moderately high x - ray absorption , plasma temperature , and required shock speed for the cool x - ray component noted above stretch the limits of what the radiative wind shock model can accommodate .",
    "a more interesting possibility is that the _ hot _ plasma is shock related",
    ". the impact of a high - velocity wind or jet - like outflow from irs-1 on a close companion or other obstruction could produce high - temperature x - ray plasma in a colliding wind shock .",
    "the colliding wind picture is usually invoked to explain high - temperature x - ray emission in massive close binaries such as wr @xmath10 o systems ( e.g. skinner et al .",
    "2001 ) , but in the present case the high - speed wind of the embedded star might actually be shocking on dense surrounding material .",
    "interestingly , seth et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have suggested that the walls of the cavity surrounding irs-1 might be the interface between outflowing and infalling material . a similar picture",
    "in which a high - velocity stellar wind is shocking on dense surrounding clumps has been discussed by kitamura et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "the maximum colliding wind shock temperature in the adiabatic case is kt@xmath40 @xmath1 1.95 ( @xmath41/1000 km s@xmath36)@xmath39 kev , where @xmath41 is the velocity component normal to the shock interface ( luo , mccray , & maclow 1990 ) .",
    "thus , a b0 v star with a terminal wind speed @xmath42 @xmath1 2500 km s@xmath36 could in principle produce very hot x - ray plasma at kt@xmath40 @xmath1 12 kev , similar to the value kt@xmath6 @xmath1 11 kev inferred for the hot component in the x - ray spectrum ( table 2 ) . the colliding wind model , if relevant , would of course need to account for the x - ray luminosity ( table 2 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity predicted for a colliding wind system is a sensitive function of mass - loss parameters and orbital separation ( luo et al . 1990 ) . in the absence of such information for irs1 ,",
    "a meaningful comparison with theory can not be made and the colliding wind scenario thus remains quite speculative .",
    "the hard x - ray continuum detected in irs-1 extends up to at least 8 kev .",
    "such hard emission represents an extreme case for wind - generated shocks but is not uncommon for x - ray emission from magnetic reconnection processes that are observed in low - mass pre - main sequence stars ( t tauri stars ) and even some low - mass protostars ( imanishi , koyama , & tsuboi 2001 ) .",
    "some additional support for magnetic behavior in massive young stellar objects comes from the _ chandra _ detection of the high - mass embedded object mon r2 irs-2 ( kohno et al .",
    "the x - ray absorption , temperature , and x - ray luminosity reported for mon r2 irs-2 are strikingly similar to the values we determine for the hot component of ngc 2071 irs-1 .",
    "however , the fluorescent fe line was not seen in mon r2 irs-2 .",
    "more importantly , the x - ray emission of mon r2 irs-2 was found to be variable on timescales of a few 10@xmath43 s , as was that of at least two other embedded high - mass ysos in mon r2 .",
    "the presence of such short - term variability in combination with very hot plasma is a strong argument in favor of magnetic processes .    because of the close similarities in x - ray spectral properties between ngc 2071 irs-1 and mon r2 irs-2 ( apart from the lack of fluorescent fe in the latter ) , it is quite possible that their high - temperature x - ray emission arises from similar processes . if the emission is indeed of magnetic origin , then the key questions are whether the emission is due to as yet undetected late - type companions or the massive ysos themselves",
    ". if the emission is intrinsic to the embedded high - mass objects , then the theoretical challenge will be to determine if the fields are internally generated ( and by what mechanism ) , or instead primordial .      in conclusion",
    ", we comment briefly on the possibility that the x - ray continuum emission of the hard source near irs-1 is nonthermal .",
    "as we have noted , the spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power - law continuum plus a gaussian fe line ( model b in table 2 ) , but the inferred absorption is much less than expected toward irs-1 .",
    "the production of nonthermal x - rays from ob star winds has been considered by chen & white ( 1991 ) . in their model ,",
    "hard x - rays above 2 kev can be produced by inverse compton scattering of stellar uv photons by relativistic electrons accelerated in wind shocks near the star .    to explore the nonthermal possibility further , we fitted the pn x - ray spectrum with a model consisting of an absorbed cool thermal component and an absorbed power - law component plus a gaussian line .",
    "the cool thermal component is intended to model any soft radiative wind shock emission and the power - law component models nonthermal emission from inverse compton scattering .",
    "different absorption columns were allowed for the thermal and power - law components .",
    "this model gives a statistically acceptable fit of the spectrum ( @xmath19/dof = 11.3/11 ) with a cool thermal plasma temperature kt@xmath15 @xmath1 0.2 kev and a photon power - law index @xmath24 = @xmath100.6 .",
    "however , the fit converges to a very large emission measure for the cool thermal component which leads to a high unabsorbed luminosity l@xmath44 @xmath2 10@xmath45 ergs s@xmath36 .",
    "the inferred presence of a very soft thermal component with extremely high emission measure viewed under high absorption log n@xmath28 @xmath1 22.9 @xmath14 is likely a result of fitting the data with an inappropriate model and the fit results seem unphysical .",
    "we thus do not favor such a hybrid thermal @xmath10 nonthermal emission model based on the existing data but the model would be worth reconsidering if higher quality spectra are obtained .",
    "we have presented results of the first x - ray observation centered on the core region of the infrared cluster in ngc 2071 .",
    "the most important ( and unanticipated ) result of this study is the unusual x - ray spectrum of the source detected within 1@xmath0 of the massive young stellar object irs-1 .",
    "the small positional offset and strong x - ray absorption inferred from thermal spectral models make an association of this x - ray source with irs-1 likely .",
    "the high x - ray temperature implied by thermal models is characteristic of magnetic processes and raises the intriguing possibility that magnetic fields play an important role in x - ray production in young high - mass stars .",
    "kohno et al .",
    "( 2002 ) were led to a similar conclusion based on _ chandra _ observations of massive young stars in mon r2 .",
    "however , the role played by any as yet unresolved close companions in the x - ray emission process is unknown .",
    "a higher resolution _ chandra _ observation of ngc 2071-ir now pending will answer several key questions regarding the origin of the unusual x - ray emission . specifically , _",
    "chandra s _ arc - second resolution will place tighter constraints on the position of the x - ray peak relative to irs-1 and will determine if nearby objects such as irs-2 , irs-3 , or irs-5 contribute to the x - ray emission . the longer _",
    "chandra _ exposure will also provide a more definitive test for variability on short timescales , a key discriminant between magnetic and shock processes .",
