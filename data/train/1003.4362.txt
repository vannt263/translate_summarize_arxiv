    "furthermore , a coupling mechanism between the qubits is needed to allow for conditional operations on multiple qubits .",
    "other interactions , especially damping mechanisms that affect the two - level system , have to be minimized .    as representations of qubits , excitonic states in single or double qds as well as spin states have been proposed @xcite .",
    "quantum information schemes in qd systems are often based on the coherent optical control of the electronic states , taking advantage of the femtosecond time scales common in current ultrafast laser optics @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction is one of the coupling mechanisms that has been proven to allow for conditional operations on qd qubits @xcite .",
    "however , it also influences the optical manipulation of the qd states , especially for small interdot distances where the coulomb interaction between neighbouring qds is an important coupling mechanism @xcite .",
    "therefore , it affects the applicability of any quantum information scheme based on qds , even if the scheme does not utilize the coulomb interaction for conditional operations . here , we want to quantify this influence and discuss the implications for qd based quantum information processing .",
    "the key quantity to describe successful quantum information processing in a physical system is the fidelity with which gates can be implemented on the considered set of qubits @xcite . for a basic evaluation of a given proposal for quantum information processing , the fidelity of a universal set of gates , consisting , e.g. , of single - qubit gates and the cnot gate , has to be investigated .",
    "fidelity calculations have been presented for single - qubit gates @xcite and two - qubit gates based on spin states in single @xcite and coupled quantum dots @xcite as well as excitonic states in single qds @xcite .",
    "the fidelity of two - qubit gates in coulomb - coupled qds , especially with entangled output states , has not been discussed in the literature . in this article , we present calculations of the fidelity of a single- and a two - qubit gate implemented on coulomb - coupled qds .",
    "we focus on a scheme utilizing the coulomb interaction for the implementation of a controlled two - qubit gate , namely the cnot gate @xcite .",
    "the quantum operations are implemented using coherent light pulses resonant to the excitonic transitions of the system . by applying a series of coherent laser pulses with fixed areas ,",
    "special quantum information gates can be realized . in particular , we consider the generation of bell states in this system .",
    "we consider a system consisting of two qds , interacting with a coherent light field and with each other via the coulomb interaction .",
    "it is assumed that the wave functions of the electrons in different dots do not overlap , i.e. , we neglect interdot tunneling .",
    "even though we focus on the low temperature regime ( a few kelvin ) , dephasing effects due to the interaction with phonons can be of importance , depending strongly on the pulse length and detuning of the dot levels @xcite . since the resulting errors are typically an order of magnitude smaller than the one arising from radiative dephasing , which is studied in this work , we do not considered electron - phonon coupling in the following . following the proposition in ref .",
    "@xcite , the qubits are represented by the single - excitonic states in each qd , one state being the qd ground state , the other being the lowest exciton state ( exciton ground state ) .",
    "the reason is as follows : due to the exchange interaction , the two heavy hole and two electronic states closest to the fermi edge typically show fine structure splitting into two bright and dark excitonic states each , which are energetically split depending on the symmetries of the qds @xcite .",
    "one of the two bright states can be selectively excited via a suitable choice of pulse polarization .",
    "we neglect the impact of spin - flip in the following , which is typically a good approximation in inas / gaas qds @xcite , where the spin - orbit coupling is weak @xcite .",
    "then , due to spin preservation , coulomb - induced transitions to dark states are suppressed , and we can neglect the influence of dark states on the radiative lifetime of the considered exciton states @xcite .",
    "therefore , we restrict the model of each qd to a two - level system in the following and neglect the spin degree of freedom , as was done , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the states are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "for the two qds , this leads to a four - level system with the basis @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the presence (= 1 ) or lack (= 0 ) of an exciton in qd @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system then reads @xmath8 the noninteracting electrons in effective mass approximation are described by @xmath9 with the energy levels @xmath10 of the electrons in the valence ( @xmath11 ) and conduction band ( @xmath12 ) in qd @xmath13 and the electron creation and annihilation operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "the pulse area is defined via the envelope @xmath20 of the pulse @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the pulse frequency : @xmath23 the coulomb interaction between the electrons within the above approximations is described by @xcite    @xmath24    with the coulomb matrix elements @xmath25 . when treated in dipole approximation",
    ", the coulomb interaction reduces to two parts represented by a nondiagonal matrix element @xmath26 and a diagonal matrix element @xmath27@xcite . the nondiagonal matrix element @xmath28 couples the two excited single - excitonic states , leading to the well - known effect of frster energy transfer @xcite .",
    "the diagonal element @xmath29 shifts the energy of the state @xmath30 and is usually denoted as the biexcitonic shift .    defining the matrix elements of the hamiltonian with respect to the basis @xmath31 via @xmath32 ( cf . ref .",

    "this allows for selective excitation of the individual qds which is necessary for the proposed quantum information schemes . in the following ,",
    "we refer to the energetically lower qd as the first qd and the energetically higher qd as the second qd .        starting with this hamiltonian",
    ", we calculate the heisenberg equations of motion for the density matrix elements of the system in rotating wave approximation @xcite . to allow for radiative damping of the system , the interaction of the electrons with the quantized light field , treated in born - markov approximation ,",
    "is included in the calculation .",
    "this results in radiative damping terms of the electronic density matrix elements .",
    "the full set of equations is discussed in ref .",

    "the factors @xmath43 depend on @xmath44 via @xmath45 : @xmath46 the new resonance energies of the single excitons are the given by @xmath47 the energy difference between the two resonances changes from @xmath40 to @xmath48 in this basis , the hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath49 with the renormalization factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the modification of the energy levels and the transition energies due to the coulomb interaction is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "all transition energies in the four - level system are altered by the frster interaction and the biexcitonic shift . for optical gating ,",
    "the influence of the coulomb interaction on the effective rabi frequencies during optical excitation is of utmost importance : via the factors @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the rabi frequencies now depend on the involved states of the coupled system . as an example , we consider the creation of an exciton in the second qd , corresponding to one of the transitions @xmath54 or @xmath55 . for the first transition , the pulse area @xmath56 is required , while the second transition requires the pulse area @xmath57 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of a single , uncoupled dot , where a pulse area of @xmath58 is needed to create full inversion .",
    "this state - dependent renormalization effect plays an important role for the applicability of quantum gates in this system as will be seen in the next section .",
    "of course , the applicability of the considered system for quantum information processing depends crucially on the size of the physical parameters . for qds in the low temperature regime , we assume a radiative damping constant of @xmath59 = ( 500 ps)@xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the energy difference of the qds is taken to be to @xmath61 mev , which is well in the range of the inhomogeneous broadening for different quantum dot types @xcite .",
    "the pulse duration is then strongly constricted , since on the one hand it has to be long enough to allow for spectral selective excitation of the qds , and on the other hand , it must be short enough to minimize the effects of damping during gating .",
    "it is here taken to be @xmath62 fs , which corresponds to a spectral pulse width of @xmath63 mev .",
    "for the implemetation of the cnot operation , this calls for a biexcitonic shift of a few mev , as will be seen below .    the size of the coulomb matrix elements @xmath28 and @xmath29 depends strongly on the material parameters and geometry of the specific qd setup such as the qd material and size , the detuning , and the interdot distance .",
    "the values can be as high as @xmath64 = 0.25 ( calculated for self - assembled inas / gaas qds with @xmath40 = 2 mev @xcite ) and @xmath65 = 1.6 ( calculated for cdse quantum dots with @xmath66 75 mev under the influence of a static electric field of @xmath67 kv / cm @xcite ) . on the other hand , very small values can always be obtained by a suitable choice of parameters ( for example , @xmath68 in cdse qds @xcite and @xmath69 in gaas interface qds @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling constants can be further influenced by external electric fields @xcite .",
    "instead of focusing on a specific parameter set , we investigate the system for a range of values of the matrix elements known to represent different qd systems .",
    "the physical realization of a desired gate will always lead to an output state with a certain amount of error compared to the ideal result .",
    "this error can be quantified with the fidelity of the process @xcite : the gate fidelity @xmath70 measures the overlap between the ideal final state and the actual final state which results by applying the gate @xmath71 .",
    "if the result of the ideal gate is a pure state @xmath72 and the actual final state is given by the density matrix @xmath73 , the fidelity is defined as @xmath74 if the result @xmath73 is identical to the desired pure state , the fidelity @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath76 , one typically defines the error of the operation as @xmath77 . expanding the pure state @xmath78 in the basis @xmath79 , @xmath80 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:12 ] ) takes the form @xmath81 the fidelity is therefore determined by the four - operator expectation values of the system , i.e. the elements of the two - electron density matrix . for the not gate on the first qubit , for example , the fidelity for the input state @xmath35 which is mapped to @xmath82 is just given by @xmath83 .",
    "quantum operations on coulomb - coupled qds can be realized following the proposition in ref .",
    "@xcite : under resonant coherent excitation of the excitons , the system can be driven from one state to the other , thus realizing gates on the computational states .",
    "the coulomb interaction is used to implement conditional gates , in the following the cnot gate .",
    "however , the resulting frster interaction mixes the basis states and therefore destroys the original computational basis as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "as was seen above , the basis in the presence of frster coupling is given by @xmath84 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore , the rabi frequencies for the single - excitonic transitions change from @xmath85 to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "the consequences for potential quantum information processing are the following :    1 .",
    "the computational subspace has to be adjusted . since the states @xmath82 and @xmath88 are no longer optically active when the coulomb interaction is considered , they can not be prepared and read out as proposed .",
    "therefore , the states @xmath89 and @xmath90 have to be regarded as part of the new computational basis .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when the system is treated theoretically , especially when calculating the fidelity of quantum operations .",
    "frster energy transfer occurs when the system is not prepared in one of its new computational basis states @xmath91 . under the influence of decoherence caused by the electron - phonon interaction",
    ", it may be irreversible @xcite , thus presenting an error that adds to the general error caused by decoherence . since we neglect electron - phonon coupling here and consider the system prepared in its computational basis , this has no influence in this work .",
    "the state - dependent renormalizations of the rabi frequencies leads to an inevitable error in single - qubit operations since the condition for switching a qubit in one qd depends on the state of the other qd .",
    "as discussed below , this error depends on the strength of the frster interaction and adds to the errors caused by decoherence .    to illustrate the importance of pulse area renormalization and basis change , we investigate the following situation :",
    "the state @xmath35 is excited by a pulse which is resonant on the first qd . for an excitation of the uncoupled system with a pulse area",
    "@xmath58 , this causes a complete inversion of the first qd and therefore corresponds to a not operation on the first qubit with the resulting state @xmath82 . in the coupled case",

    "the fidelity is usually calculated by averaging over all possible computational input states . in our case , there are important qualitative differences in the performance of the four basis states of the computational subspace .",
    "therefore , we investigate the fidelity for these four basis states separately .      in this section , we investigate the not gate on the first qubit of our system .",
    "it is implemented by applying an @xmath57-pulse which is resonant on the first qd ( see table  [ table:1 ] for the corresponding truth table ) .",

    "this is due to the fact that these states are excited with the `` wrong '' pulse area , as discussed above .",
    "thus , the adaptation of the pulse area does not optimize the gate for all possible input states : on the average , the fidelity is diminished compared to the uncoupled case . in this way , the frster interaction presents a problem for the proposed quantum information schemes and has to be minimized .    in the inset in fig .",
