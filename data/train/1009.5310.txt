    "psr j1741@xmath12054 , discovered in a blind pulsation search of a _ fermi _ point source @xcite , is a @xmath8ms , characteristic age @xmath9kyr @xmath2-ray pulsar . the pulsar was then detected in archival parkes radio observations and subsequently studied at gbt @xcite , showing it to be very faint and deeply scintillating .",
    "the radio observations also gave a remarkably low dispersion measure @xmath10 , which for a standard galactic electron density model @xcite implies a distance of @xmath11kpc .",
    "this makes this one of the closest energetic pulsars known . at this distance",
    "the low flux density observed at pulsar discovery , @xmath12jy , also makes this the least luminous radio pulsar known . indeed , since the source scintillates to undetectability at many epochs , the time average radio luminosity is @xmath13 .",
    "the low distance was already suspected from the relatively high @xmath2-ray flux ( for the modest @xmath14 spin - down luminosity ) . at the @xmath15-estimated distance ,",
    "the pulsar would emit 28% of its spin - down power in @xmath2-rays , if the radiation were isotropic .",
    "since psr j1741@xmath12054 is an important addition to the set of nearby , energetic young pulsars , further investigation of its energy loss and environs are needed . in particular , we wish to constrain its motion , true age , non - photon spindown deposition and interaction with its environment .",
    "for example , it may be a significant source of @xmath16 injection in the solar neighborhood .",
    "such injection is generally visible as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the shape of this nebula can constrain the source s distance , ism interaction , and proper motion .",
    "if the spin orientation can be measured @xcite , then we can also model the @xmath2-ray beam shape and connect the observed @xmath2-ray flux to its true luminosity , predicting @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , provides the @xmath2-ray efficiency , a critical test of pulsar models .",
    "we accordingly searched for a pwn , discovering an h@xmath0 bow shock and an x - ray pwn and trail .",
    "like the few other pulsar bow shock nebulae , this is a non - radiative , balmer - dominated shock .",
    "the shock velocity is relatively low , and doppler broadened post - shock emission traces details of its flow , presenting an opportunity for the study of collisionless shock structure under unusual conditions , as well as constraining properties of the pulsar wind .",
    "we describe initial observations and conclusions here .",
    "additional discussion of the x - ray pwn and of the spectral properties of the pulsar point source are presented in @xcite .",

    "our initial detection of the psr j1741@xmath12054 pwn was made in a 600s exposure using the wiyn 3.6 m telescope and the minimo camera with the kp w012 ( @xmath18 ) narrow - band h@xmath0 filter on march 24 , 2009 .",
    "an additional 4@xmath19s exposure plus a continuum frame were obtained the next night . unfortunately all data suffered from poor ( 1.4@xmath11.8@xmath20 ) seeing .",
    "nevertheless , these data revealed a clear elliptical ( @xmath21 ) edge - brightened shell .",
    "as this is close to the galactic bulge ( @xmath22 ) , the continuum frame was crowded with field stars .",
    "figure 1 shows the h@xmath0 image , without continuum subtraction .",
    "we were able to use the spectroscopic flux calibration ( see below ) to estimate the total ( continuum - subtracted ) h@xmath0 flux of the nebula as @xmath23 .",
    "we subsequently ( aug 21 , 2009 ) obtained 3@xmath24600s exposure using the efosc2 camera on the ntt 3.6 m through the h@xmath0#692 filter . while the image quality was somewhat better ( @xmath25 ) , the wider ( @xmath26 ) transmission band and lower peak throughput gave the h@xmath0 nebula sharper edge structure , but lower contrast ( figure [ nttim ] ) . on this image",
    "we show the position of the _ cxo _ point source and the locations of the @xmath27 slits used for the spectroscopic study .",
    "5.9truecm    -1truecm      we obtained a _ cxo_/acis - s observation ( obsid 11251 ) of the pulsar field on may 21 , 2010 ( = mjd 55337.1 ) , with 48.8ks of exposure .",
    "the pulsar was placed near optimum focus on the backside illuminated s3 chip and the ccds were operated in half - frame vfaint mode , reading out every 1.64s to reduce pileup . a bright point source and compact nebula are seen , locating the pulsar to 17h 41 m 57.28s , @xmath120@xmath28 54@xmath29 11.8@xmath20 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the crowded optical field made it difficult to identify field x - ray sources .",
    "however , over the s3 half - chip several soft ( coronal emission ) sources were clearly identified with field stars , confirming the x - ray / optical frame tie at the @xmath31 level .",
    "there is diffuse , faint x - ray emission in a pwn trail extending some @xmath32 at position angle pa=@xmath33 ( n through e ) .",
    "this structure contains @xmath34 counts . from 2@xmath35 from the pulsar",
    "the trail contains an additional 92@xmath36 counts .",
    "finally , the compact core contains @xmath37 counts in a @xmath38 radius region about the pulsar , dominated by the point source .",
    "the emission from these structures is consistent with a simple absorbed power law with spectral index @xmath39 and absorbing column @xmath40 .",
    "the point source clearly shows an additional soft thermal component , and the detailed spectral measurements of these structures are discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on the pwn morphology .",
    "the region around the point source appears slightly extended . after subtracting",
    "a psf generated with marx , shifted and scaled to best match the point source component , the excess appears dominated by a diagonal band , @xmath41 , with a minor axis at pa=@xmath42 .",
    "this structure appears to contain @xmath43 counts or 11% of the total counts in this region .",
    "as the minor axis pa is within 5@xmath28 of the large scale x - ray trail axis ( figure [ psfsub ] ) , we associate this structure with the equatorial torus of the pwn . the 3:1 aspect ratio suggests a planar structure seen edge on , and implies that the pulsar spin axis is close to the plane of the sky .",
    "5.5truecm    -0.5truecm      pulsar h@xmath0 bow shock nebulae are relatively rare , since the pulsar wind must impact a partly neutral medium .",
    "typically , this means that the pulsar has escaped its supernova remnant birthsite and is interacting with the general ism @xcite .",
    "the shock spectra , however , are particularly interesting as the shocked gas is advected downstream on a time short compared to the cooling time .",
    "this means that these are non - radiative shocks and are dominated by balmer emission rather than the usual forbidden lines @xcite . when the up - stream neutral atoms , which are unaffected by the fields in the shock , drift into the shocked ism gas they can be excited , producing line radiation at the ( cold ) radial velocity of the ambient medium gas . for typical conditions",
    "the ratio of excitation to ionization rates is @xmath44 so that we obtain an ism - velocity balmer photon for every @xmath45 neutral atoms .",
    "however , in addition , the atoms can charge - exchange with the hot shocked ions .",
    "this gives rise to excited neutrals in the post - shock flow and a broad line component at the systemic radial velocity of the post - shock gas .",
    "thus spatially - resolved , kinematically - resolved observations of the line emission can provide a wealth of information on the local ism and bow - shock kinematics @xcite .",
    "we were able to obtain two @xmath27 long - slit spectra of the psr j1741@xmath12054 bow shock , using the keck i / lris on june ll 2010 ( mjd 55358.5 ) .",
    "a total of 900s exposure was taken with the slit at @xmath46 ( along the pwn symmetry axis ) and 1200s total exposure with the slit at @xmath47 . both exposures covered the pulsar position . unfortunately , since only one amplifier was available in the lris red camera , the long slit was truncated .",
    "however , we managed to cover the pwn emission ; the slit locations were accurately determined from recorded slit images and are shown on figure 2 .",
    "7.2truecm    for these observations , a 5600 dichroic separated the red and blue beams .",
    "the blue camera employed a 600l / mm , 4000 blaze grating and covered 3100 - 5600@xmath48 at a resolution of @xmath49/pixel . for the bow shock exposures ,",
    "the red camera employed the 1200l / mm , 7500 grating for a resolution of @xmath50/pixel . with",
    "the 1@xmath20 slit the achieved resolution as measured from the night sky lines near h@xmath0 was 1.48 or 68@xmath51 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the spatial resolution along the slit was 0.24@xmath20/pixel .",
    "for the blue channel , we were able to employ standard calibrations .",
    "unfortunately the red channel configuration was non - standard for the observing run and a flux standard was not obtained in this configuration .",
    "however , we were able to use flux measurements at a lower resolution setting along with measured grating responses to recover the red flux calibration with a conservative estimate of 15% accuracy .",
    "the wavelength calibration was refined by reference to the night sky lines and line velocities have been converted to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) using the @xcite constants .",
    "figure [ bsspec ] shows the full spectrum of the bright limb in front of the pulsar from the @xmath52 observation .",
    "the strong dominance of the balmer emission is clear , although a few of the brightest forbidden lines are also visible .",
    "these lines were detectable only in the brightest portions of the shock limb , so we have not been able trace this component separately . table 1 contains measurements of the line fluxes .    lcrl[h ! ! ]",

    "@xcite have estimated the balmer ratios for the broad component of a radiative shock ( their model 2 ) .",
    "for the optically thin ( case a ) situation , they find @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "our corresponding extinction estimates are @xmath69 and @xmath70 ; the @xmath71 overlap range is @xmath720.46 . however if the ly@xmath55 optical depth is @xmath73 , trapping increases the expected h@xmath0 flux and the predicted broad line ratios are @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the h@xmath0 values then gives @xmath760 ; physical , positive values are allowed only at the @xmath77 level .",
    "the h@xmath2 flux gives @xmath78 .",
    "thus we conclude that the selective extinction is @xmath79 with smaller values preferred for finite thickness shocks , especially for the h@xmath0 measurement . for reference",
    ", the fitting formulae for extinction values in @xcite give @xmath80 for this direction and @xmath81kpc .",
    "our limit on the extinction can be translated to an effective hydrogen column @xmath82 , in agreement with the x - ray spectral fitting of the pwn . for either our conservative upper limit or the lower extinction inferred for modest optical depth shocks",
    "the neutral column is substantially larger than the low @xmath83 inferred from the dm , suggesting low ionization along this line of sight .    with the spectral resolution and s / n available we were able to resolve the h@xmath0 lines , making an initial exploration of the velocity structure in the post - shock flow .",
    "in figure [ slitspec ] we show the h@xmath0 spectra along the two slit axes , with velocity shifts measured relative to the lsr as determined from night sky lines .",
    "emission from the approaching ( blue ) and receding ( red ) sides of the bow shock are clearly seen in the pa=@xmath84 panel .",
    "interestingly the front of the bow shock appears to be dominated by blue - shifted emission .",
    "we discuss a likely interpretation of this peculiar velocity structure below .",

    "the spatial and kinematic information provided by these observations give an excellent opportunity to probe the geometry of the pwn outflow @xcite . very helpful in this study",
    "are the elegant solutions to the thin momentum - conserving bow shock provided by @xcite .",
    "although these analytic results strictly only describe the shape of a contact discontinuity for a thin , fully mixed cold flow , they do provide a good approximate shape for the non - radiative forward shock in the ism @xcite .",
    "the general velocity structure also follows the numerical simulations , although the cold analytic model has somewhat denser flows and correspondingly higher velocities downstream from the bow shock apex .",
    "the characteristic standoff angle of the contact discontinuity in the thin shock limit is @xmath85 where for a relativistic pulsar wind the momentum flux is @xmath86 and the numerical value is scaled to the nominal spindown flux and distance of psr j1741@xmath12054 traveling at 100@xmath87 through a medium of number density @xmath88 .",
    "thus we expect a small stand - off angle for the bow shock , as seen in figure 1 .",
    "numerical simulations show that the forward ism shock scale is a factor @xmath89 larger @xcite .",
    "however , figure 1 shows that the observed h@xmath0 shock is very flat at the apex ; it does not fit well to the standard @xcite thin shock solution .",
    "while the numerical thick bow shock models do show a somewhat wider angle spread downstream , they do not display the very small standoff and flattened apex of the psr j1741@xmath12054 bow shock .",
    "effects that may produce such flattened structure are underlying wind asymmetry and projection to the earth line - of - sight .",
    "@xcite has provided useful expressions for the structure of anisotropic winds . in the pulsar case",
    ", we expect that the wind momentum flux will be axisymmetric about the pulsar spin axis . in general",
    "this provides momentum deposition misaligned with the bow shock axis . however , there is good evidence @xcite that pulsar spin and proper motion axis have a tendency to be aligned .",
    "we therefore focus on the aligned , axisymmetric wind .",
    "the pulsar wind is also highly relativistic , so that the mass of the bow shock shell is dominated by the swept - up mass of the ism . in the nomenclature of @xcite",
    "this is @xmath90 , while the aligned case is @xmath91 .",
    "we further restrict to an equatorially symmetric wind ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "an isotropic wind has @xmath93 while an equatorial ( @xmath94 ) wind has @xmath95 . for these conditions",
    "the analytic solution is a surface of rotation with pulsar shock distance @xmath96 ) for @xmath97 the angle to the direction of the pulsar - ism velocity with a cylindrical coordinate @xmath98 we can also write the tangential velocity ( in the bow shock frame ) and surface density of swept - up mass in the cold shell in terms of two quantities @xmath99/4\\ ] ] and @xmath100/4\\ ] ] with @xmath101^{1/2}/{\\tilde { \\bar \\omega}}^2\\ ] ] the tangential surface velocity in the shell , @xmath102 the shell surface mass density , and @xmath103 the mean mass per particle of the ambient ism",
    ".    this bow shock structure will be axisymmetric in some angle @xmath104 about the pulsar velocity , which will be inclined by angle @xmath105 to the earth line - of - sight . to complete the model of the bow shock appearance and radial velocity structure we project to the plane of the sky .",
    "this places the emission at projected angles @xmath106 with respect to the ( pulsar ) wind origin with @xmath107 and @xmath108 the emission from each point along the bow shock is proportional to the appropriate @xmath109 and the projected velocity ( in the observer frame ) is given by @xmath110 with @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "note that this velocity solution is for the mixed ( cooled , zero pressure ) flow of the swept up gas . in practice ,",
    "numerical simulations show modest departures from this analytic solution for the tangential velocity @xcite and a detailed solution for the full line structure of the nebula should consider such effects .",
    "however , a more basic difference lies in the fact that the non - radiative h@xmath0 arises from neutrals drifting into , and charge exchanging with , ions in the post - shock flow .",
    "thus the h@xmath0 structure depends strongly on the portion of this flow which is reached by such neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "in particular , immediately behind the forward ( ism ) shock we expect that the gas has velocity @xmath112 , where the angle between the pulsar velocity and the shock normal is @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "only later does the post - shock flow converge to the tangent to the contact discontinuity .",
    "this effect may be seen in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "thus immediately behind the ism shock one expects a line - of - sight velocity @xmath114 since @xmath115 is always positive , this velocity always has the sign of @xmath116 .",
    "an initial question is whether the shock created by an equatorial wind can reproduce the flattened shape of this pulsar bow shock .",
    "one way to parametrize this shape is the ratio of the perpendicular half angular size @xmath117 , measured through the pulsar , to the angle from the pulsar to the projected limb of the wind shock in the forward direction @xmath118 .",
    "note that @xmath119 .",
    "this ratio is very large for psr j1741@xmath12054 s bow shock , @xmath120 .",
    "we have computed this ratio for a number of axisymmetric , aligned wind bow shock models .",
    "figure [ shockshape ] shows that the projected shock limb has a ratio nearly independent of @xmath105 for an isotropic ( @xmath93 ) wind , but that the ratio can reach the observed value for a @xmath121 ( @xmath95 ) wind and a pulsar motion nearly in the plane of the sky .",
    "considering winds that are even more equatorially concentrated or including the flaring effect of the finite pressure in a thick bow shock allows somewhat smaller @xmath105 to be accommodated .",
    "7.9truecm    figure [ mod_im ] shows the projected shape of an equatorial relativistic wind emanating from the pulsar position ( circle ) for an inclination @xmath122 . for comparison ,",
    "the line shows the limb of the isotropic wind bow shock ; the standoff distance for the equatorial wind is appreciably reduced .",
    "note that , since formally @xmath94 , the bow shock approaches the star in the forward ( @xmath123 ) direction . since the pulsar wind likely has a jet component , a physical bow shock would be smooth at the apex .",
    "similar matching to the h@xmath0 limb was used by @xcite to argue that the wind of the millisecond pulsar psr j2124@xmath13358 is anisotropic . for psr j1741@xmath12054",
    "we have additionally been able to connect the shock shape with anisotropy detected in the x - ray synchrotron nebula (  2.2 ) .",
    "we next check if our model can explain the features of figure [ slitspec ] .",
    "most remarkable is the dominance of blue - shifted emission at and in front of the pulsar . for the pa=@xmath84",
    "slit , the bright knot at the apex is at @xmath124 to @xmath125 .",
    "the cross - axis slit has h@xmath0 offset to @xmath126 to @xmath127 , with no equivalent red - shifted component .",
    "this is significantly offset from the systemic ( ism ) velocity .",
    "the lack of any red - shifted emission is at first surprising , given that mass flows around the bow shock .",
    "however , if the pulsar is moving out of the plane of the sky ( @xmath128 ) , we see that the prompt post - shock broad - line emission ( from neutral atom charge exchange ) will show negative radial velocities from both sides of the nebula .",
    "this is illustrated in the top two panels of figure [ mod_spec ] , which trace the velocity structure of the prompt emission .",
    "here we plot a model for @xmath129 to better separate the velocity components .",
    "the @xmath130 models ( for a 3d space velocity @xmath131 ) that match the shock shape also provide the best match to the velocity shifts in the slit spectra .",
    "the immediate post - shock layers can dominate if the neutrals penetrate only partly into the shocked ism , before suffering nearly complete ionization .",
    "this is equivalent to case c of @xcite .",
    "in fact psr j1741@xmath12054 has a relatively large spindown luminosity among pulsars showing ism h@xmath0 shocks ( although below that of psr b0740 - 28 ) , so if the density and ionization fraction of the upstream medium are high , ionization may indeed be strong in the shocked ism .",
    "thus , ahead of the pulsar where the shock is nearly normal , neutral h may only exist in the immediate post - shock layer and blue shifted emission would dominate the observed spectrum .",
    "the pulsar space velocity @xmath132 is modest and as one moves behind the pulsar position , the shock obliquity @xmath133 increases sharply and the post - shock heating drops . as ionization drops , neutral h may reach the bulk flow along the contact discontinuity ( bucciantini & bandiera 2001 case b ) . charge exchange will continue and thus we expect components with negative radial velocity ( near side ) and positive radial velocity ( far side ) . indeed in figure",
    "[ slitspec ] , across the body of the shell , the pa=@xmath84 spectrum shows two components with velocity extrema @xmath134 and @xmath135 from the front and back sides of the flow .",
    "figure [ mod_spec ] shows the computed radial velocity for this ` mixed component ' .",
    "the large positive and negative velocities expected at the pulsar position are not seen in the pa=@xmath136 spectrum or in the pa=@xmath84 spectrum in front of the pulsar , suggesting that near the apex neutral h atoms do not penetrate to this ` mixed ' tangential portion of the flow .",
    "the lower right panel shows a heuristic merged model , where the ` mixed ' component grows as @xmath97 increases downstream .",
    "this smoothed model bears reasonable similarity to the observed 2d spectrum , although it fails to reproduce the ` closed off ' shape along the symmetry axis and the red - shifted ` mixed ' emission from the body of the nebula is less prominent in the data .",
    "clearly additional effects are needed to reproduce the full velocity structure of this bow shock and additional imaging and spectroscopy will be needed to fully explain its origin .",
    "for example , the close - out of the symmetry axis spectrum suggests an expanding bubble structure rather than an open - backed bow shock .",
    "bubble structure has been seen for other pwn bow shocks ( e.g psr b2224 + 65 s ` guitar nebula ' , cordes et al .",
    "1993 ) ; @xcite have proposed that such bubble structures are a natural consequence of instabilities in the post - shock flow of the relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "the fainter and slower red wing ` mixed ' emission 5 - 10@xmath20 behind the pulsar might be due to ism inhomogeneities or , plausibly , instabilities in the pwn trail .",
    "one additional difference to the data is the lack of an obvious ism - velocity ` narrow ' line component in the measured spectra . in the model spectra",
    ", the component is assigned 10% of the broad - line flux .",
    "the limited lris spectral resolution makes it difficult to discern any such component , particularly in the brighter knots of the bow shock emission .",
    "however , we estimate from the pa=@xmath84 spectrum of the nebular body a broad - to - narrow intensity ratio @xmath137 . interestingly",
    ", this ratio provides a measure of @xmath138 , probing electron - ion equilibration in the post - shock emitting region @xcite ; relatively large ratios and fast equilibration appear to occur in low velocity shocks @xcite , supporting a modest velocity for psr j1741@xmath12054 .",
    "if the narrow component can be isolated and kinematically resolved , it provides much additional information on the upstream medium s density and on pre - shock heating of the ambient gas .",
    "7.0truecm    3.9truecm",
    "the leading edge of the bow shock appears structured , especially in the ntt image , so it is somewhat difficult to measure the pulsar - apex angle and cross - axis half angle .",
    "our best estimates are @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we would like to relate these to the characteristic contact discontinuity standoff angle @xmath141 . in @xcite ,",
    "the ism shock / contact discontinuity angle ratio was estimated as @xmath142 at the shock apex . while finite pressure effects can cause this to grow slightly downstream , here we assume a constant ratio .",
    "also , for the @xmath95 , @xmath143 shape , we infer @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "together these estimates let us infer a characteristic ( isotropic wind ) contact discontinuity standoff angle @xmath146 .",
    "this characteristic offset implies @xmath147 . as noted above the velocity structure",
    "suggests that @xmath148 , so we loosely constrain the product @xmath149 . in turn",
    "this suggests a plausible density @xmath150 if we adopt the dm distance .    for the allowed extinction range ( @xmath151 ; i.e @xmath152 )",
    ", we infer an h@xmath0 number flux from the full nebula of @xmath153 .",
    "this may be related to the neutral density and velocity of the upstream medium @xcite .",
    "for example the upstream neutrals will produce a narrow component h@xmath0 number flux @xmath154 for an excitation - to - ionization ratio @xmath155 and effective full nebula angular radius @xmath156 .",
    "this predicts @xmath157 of the observed flux of the ( broad ) h@xmath0 line .",
    "one can make a similar estimate for the flux of the broad component , depending on the ratio of charge - transfer to ionization rates , @xmath158 , i.e. @xmath159 ( depending on the extinction ) . with",
    "the low @xmath160 and @xmath161 estimated above , we would infer a large yield of broad @xmath162 photons from charge transfer interactions , @xmath163 .",
    "figures in @xcite suggest that the broad to narrow ratio grows rapidly at low shock velocities , especially for optically thin shocks , although velocities as small as 150 @xmath164 are not computed .",
    "additional modeling and , especially , an accurate measurement of the narrow line component would help settle whether such high efficiency conversion to h@xmath0 occurs .    turning to the nebula distance , we see that the relatively low @xmath165 inferred from the x - ray absorption column and the balmer line ratios supports a close distance for this pulsar , with the hi surveys @xcite showing values twice that inferred for the nebula at distances as small as @xmath166kpc ( _ heasarc nh tool _ ) . with improved spectral measurements of the pwn h@xmath0",
    "we should be able to fit for a precise pulsar space velocity and inclination .",
    "comparison with a proper motion , measurable from _ cxo _ x - ray imaging ( @xmath167 7y baseline ) or possibly hst imaging ( few year baseline ) would then yield a direct kinematic distance to the neutron star .",
    "this is particularly valuable for understanding the apparently very high @xmath2-ray efficiency .",
    "our match to the @xmath168 ratio suggests @xmath169 . for our estimated @xmath170",
    "this is also consistent with the spread of velocities in our slit spectra and with the measured apex blue shift @xmath171 expected if the surrounding medium radial velocity is near the lsr and prompt emission dominates near the apex . if the pulsar spin and velocity are aligned , this implies a pulsar viewing angle @xmath172 . in turn",
    "this may be compared with the viewing angles inferred for the observed @xmath2-ray pulse profile @xcite .",
    "the two pole caustic ( tpc ) model has great difficulty producing the @xmath2-ray pulse width @xmath173 and lag from the radio @xmath174 . in the outer gap ( og )",
    "picture , @xmath2-rays for such an old pulsar are only seen if viewed from near the equator , @xmath175 , although the observed pulse width and @xmath2-radio lag are then easily achieved .",
    "the best - fit prefers @xmath176 , consistent with the angles inferred from the bow shock geometry above .",
    "the discovery of an h@xmath0 bow shock associated with the @xmath2-ray pulsar psr j1741@xmath12054 provides an important opportunity to constrain the geometry and momentum deposition of a pulsar wind .",
    "our initial images and spectra suggest that this pulsar wind has a strong equatorial concentration and that the spin axis ( and space velocity ) are close to the plane of the sky .",
    "the spectroscopy implies a low extinction ( close distance ) for the nebula , consistent with pulsar dispersion measure estimates .",
    "spectra were obtained for two slices across the nebula which are best described by a pulsar velocity of @xmath177 directed @xmath178 out of the plane of the sky .",
    "the variation in the spectrum along the nebula s velocity axis suggests that different layers ( prompt and then mixed ) of the post - shock flow are emitting near the nebula apex and tail respectively .",
    "some unmodeled features are seen and numerical simulation including pressure effects in the shock tail may be needed to explain the full velocity structure",
    ".    the apparently equatorially concentrated wind and near edge - on view are consistent with inferences of pwn flow from observations of other pulsars and with the @xmath2-ray emission geometry inferred from lat pulsations .",
    "pulsar h@xmath0 bow shocks often display high symmetry suggesting that careful modeling can exploit their spatial and velocity structure to probe the dynamics of collisionless shocks in partly ionized media at a range of inclination angles .",
    "if , as suggested by our initial imaging and spectroscopy , the portion of the post shock flow probed by the h@xmath0 emission varies along the bow shock surface , then the shock of psr j1741@xmath12054 provides an especially important laboratory to study the structure of collisionless non - radiative shocks . improved measurements",
    "could precisely determine the anisotropy of the relativistic pulsar wind , may constrain the degree of wind - velocity alignment , and can help deliver a kinematic measurement of the pulsar distance .",
    "such studies will , however , require higher spatial and spectral resolution data at good sensitivity .",
    "this might be acquired through intermediate resolution integral field studies or fabry - perot h@xmath0 scans @xcite .",
    "we thank tony readhead for collaboration on _ fermi _ counterpart studies and for the lris integrations , and aaron meisner for help with the wiyn observing and minimo processing .",
    "we also thank pablo saz - parkinson , scott ransom and paul ray for valuable discussions on the detection and distance of the lat pulsars .",
    "finally , we thank the referee , marten van kerkwijk , for a prompt , careful reading and useful suggestions that improved the text . this work was supported in part by nasa grants nnx08aw30 g and nnx10ad11 g and chandra grant go0 - 11097x .",
