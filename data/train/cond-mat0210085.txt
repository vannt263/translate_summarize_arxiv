    "the issue of discrete random geometries arises in numerous problems of quantum gravity @xcite , string theory , condensed matter physics ( e.g. , branched polymers @xcite ) , and classical statistical mechanics . in these problems ,",
    "a fundamental question about the global structure of a random network ( that is , a statistical ensemble of matrices ) and its consequences naturally arises .",
    "this question exists even when the notion `` network '' is not used directly in the description of such a problem . as a simple example",
    ", we mention the backgammon ( `` balls - in - boxes '' ) model which was considered as a mean - field description of simplicial gravity @xcite . formally speaking ,",
    "the formulation of this simple model does not contain the notion `` network '' .",
    "however , the statistical ensembles that are produced by the backgammon model can be easily related to random networks with a complex distribution of connections , which is another representation of the model .    in this paper , we study the global structural organization of a wide class of complex random networks , or speaking more strictly , we study their metric structure .",
    "an intervertex distance in a network is naturally defined as the length of the shortest path between a pair of vertices .",
    "so , the statistics of intervertex distances , that is an intervertex distance distribution , actually determine the metric structure of a random network .",
    "this distribution is the basic structural characteristic of random networks which are under extensive study by physicists for the last years ( e.g. see refs .",
    "networks with fat - tailed degree distributions show a number of exciting effects ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and are especially intriguing .",
    "( by definition , degree is the total number of connections of a vertex , which is called sometimes `` the connectivity of a vertex '' ; a degree distribution is the distribution of degrees of vertices . )    the intervertex distance distribution was obtained only for several very specific graphs . even for basic uncorrelated random networks with a given degree distribution , the first moment of the intervertex distance distribution , that is the mean intervertex distance or the mean shortest - path length of a network , was only estimated @xcite .",
    "this estimation used the important fact that these networks are tree - like locally .",
    "this is not true at a large scale . in the recent paper @xcite the presence of loops was taken into account ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) for estimating the mean intervertex distance of networks with a fat - tailed degree distribution .    in this paper",
    "we propose a rigorous approach which takes into account both the locally tree - like structure of uncorrelated networks and the presence of loops on a large scale .",
    "this approach allows us to explicitly calculate the intervertex distance distribution and its moments , and to describe their dependence on the size of a network .",
    "our approach is valid for uncorrelated random networks with a given degree distribution .",
    "these basic `` equilibrium '' networks are graphs , which are maximally random under the constraint that their degree distribution is given . in graph theory",
    "these networks ( loosely speaking , one of their versions ) are called labelled random graphs with a given degree sequence or the configuration model @xcite .",
    "these networks are a starting point for the study of the effects of complex degree distributions , and so are of fundamental importance .",
    "the ( uncorrelated ) random graph with a given degree distribution can be constructed in the following way .",
    "take @xmath0 vertices .",
    "attach to the vertices `` spines '' , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , according to a given sequence @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , so that the vertices look like a family of `` hedgehogs '' .",
    "connect various spines at random .",
    "this procedure provides the maximally random graph with a given degree distribution @xmath6 . without lack of generality we can set the number of zero - degree ( i.e. isolated ) vertices to be zero , @xmath7 .",
    "the main global topological properties of such a networks are governed by the parameter @xcite : @xmath8 which is the ratio of the mean numbers of the second- and first - nearest neighbours of a vertex in the network . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the first and the second moments of the degree distribution . for @xmath11 ,",
    "all the connected components of the network remain finite in the infinite network limit ( by definition , this is a thermodynamic limit ) . if @xmath12 , the _ giant connected component",
    "_ arises , whose size is proportional to the size of the whole network .",
    "the condition for the emergence of the giant connected component @xcite , @xmath12 , may be written as : @xmath13 so , the giant connected component is formed only if the fraction of `` dead ends '' , @xmath14 , is sufficiently small .",
    "if `` dead ends '' are absent , giant connected component exists and , in the thermodynamic limit , includes almost all vertices .",
    "( we do not consider the case when the network consists solely of the vertices of degree two ) .",
    "we present a consistent approach allowing rigorous calculations of the intervertex distance statistics within a giant connected component in such random networks .",
    "the main object we will consider is the sizes of connected components of a vertex in the graph ( see a schematic view of the structure of an uncorrelated network in fig . [ comp ] ) .",
    "the @xmath15-th order connected component of a vertex consists of all the vertices within the first @xmath15 coordination spheres of the vertex ; in other words  the distance to the central vertex in the @xmath15-th connected component does not exceed @xmath15 . obviously , in a random graph the size of the connected component is a fluctuating random variable .",
    "the idea of our method is to construct a recurrent relation expressing the size distribution of the @xmath16-th connected component through that of the @xmath15-th connected component .",
    "this relation can be derived in two limiting cases : when the size of a connected component is negligibly small compared to the size of a network and when a connected component is a finite fraction of an infinitely large network .",
    "sewing together the results in these limiting cases yields the complete set of connected component size distributions .",
    "in particular , this allows us to obtain the intervertex distance distribution in a random graphs .",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows :    * we find an explicit expression for the mean intervertex distance , @xmath17 . in ref .",
    "@xcite this result was obtained as an estimate , here we present an exact result with an exact constant .",
    "* we obtain the form of the intervertex distance distribution and show that in the networks under consideration , almost all vertices within a giant connected component are nearly equidistant .",
    "more precisely , we found that the mean square deviation of an intervertex distance is finite in the infinite network .    to find the intervertex distribution function , one has to solve the functional equation , whose form is determined by the degree distribution in the network .",
    "sometimes this can be done explicitly ( two examples are considered in the paper ) .",
    "however , even in a general case , all essential features of the distance distribution can be reproduced analytically .",
    "first , the cumulative distance distribution @xmath18 ( the probability that the intervertex distance is less than or equal to @xmath19 ) , appears to be actually the function of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the average intervertex distance , and @xmath23 is a number of the order of unity .",
    "second , we find both the asymptotics of @xmath24 at large deviations @xmath25 of distances from the mean value , positive and negative . at large negative @xmath25 , this asymptotics is determined by the first two moments of the degree distribution , @xmath26 .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath27 on the other side  at large positive @xmath25is determined by vertices with the lowest degrees . obviously , @xmath28 as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the capacity of the giant connected component , because @xmath31 is precisely the probability that a randomly chosen pair of vertices is interconnected .",
    "if the lowest degree is either one or two , then the asymptotics of @xmath32 at @xmath33 decreases exponentially with a linear preexponential factor .",
    "if the lowest degree of the vertex is three or higher , then the asymptotics decreases faster than an exponent .",
    "the scheme suggested herein works only if the parameter @xmath34 is finite , which means the convergence of the first and second moments of the degree distribution in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is not the case if this degree distribution asymptotically behaves as @xmath35 with @xmath36 at large degrees @xmath37 .",
    "we have studied the case of @xmath38 , @xmath39 with large but finite value of the cut - off parameter @xmath40 . as a result",
    ", we have found that in this case @xmath41 , and @xmath24 is independent both of the system size and the cut - off parameter .",
    "again , the mean square deviation of intervertex distances is of the order of unity , and all the vertices in the giant connected component are nearly equidistant .",
    "this result is valid in the limit @xmath42 , when we assume that the cut - off parameter is large . in reality , in the finite - size networks a degree distribution has some natural size - dependent cut - off .",
    "how the cut - off parameter varies with the size of the network , depends on the details of a construction procedure . for example , in the configuration model the position of the cut - off depends on how the limit @xmath43 is approached . we show that the picture described above remains valid , if the cut - off parameter grows with the network size sufficiently slowly , namely , not faster than @xmath44 .",
    "thus , for `` scale - free '' networks with @xmath39 , we arrive at the stable distribution of intervertex distances around their steadily growing mean value @xmath45 if the construction procedure ensures not very fast growth of the degree distribution cut - off with the network size . in this situation",
    ", @xmath46 grows with @xmath0 slower than @xmath47 but faster than @xmath48 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ defs ]",
    "we define main notions . in section [ micr ]",
    "we remind and essentially refine the approach of ref .",

    "we explain , how the results of two previous sections can be sewed together in the region , where the size of a connected component is large compared to unity but small compared to the size of the whole network . in section [ isum ]",
    "the results of previous sections are briefly summed up and general results for various quantities of interest are presented . in section [ exp ] , as an illustrative example , we present an exact analytical solution for the uncorrelated network with the degree distribution @xmath49 , @xmath50 . in section [ power ] the network with the degree distribution @xmath51 , @xmath39 and @xmath50 , @xmath52 is studied . in section [ concl ]",

    "the degree of a vertex , @xmath61 , ( sometimes it is called the vertex connectivity ) is the number of edges , attached to the vertex : @xmath62 .",

    "several ensembles , equivalent in the thermodynamic limit @xmath42 , may be used @xcite . for example",
    ", one can use a `` microcanonical one '' , usually referred to as the `` configuration model '' . here",
    "we ascribe equal statistical weights to all possible graphs with @xmath68 vertices , @xmath69 of them have a degree @xmath37 , @xmath70 ( without lack of generality we can exclude the possibility that a vertex is of zero degree ) .",
    "we assume , that in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath42 , @xmath71 . for this ensemble",
    ", we have the degree distribution : @xmath72 one can show that in the thermodynamic limit even degrees of the nearest - neighbour vertices are uncorrelated in such networks : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the average vertex degree .",
    "we introduced the notation @xmath75 for the kronecker symbol @xmath76 .",
    "relation ( [ 6 ] ) plays a crucial role .",
    "in fact , the scheme presented here is based on this relation .",
    "we call the set of vertices , for which the shortest distance from some vertex equals @xmath15 , the @xmath15-th _ shell _ of this vertex . the union of the shells of a vertex from zeroth to @xmath15-th one inclusively is called the @xmath15-th ( connected ) _ component _ of the vertex .",
    "following @xcite , it is convenient to use the degree distribution in @xmath77-representation ( sometimes this object is called the generating function of the distribution ) : @xmath78    another useful quantity is what may be called an `` edge multiplication '' distribution function @xmath79 .",
    "this is the conditional probability that in a connected pair of vertices , a vertex has its degree equal to @xmath80 : @xmath81 or , in @xmath77-representation , @xmath82 we make use that in our ensemble all pairs of vertices are statistically equivalent .",
    "@xmath79 may also be thought of as the probability that , choosing a random _ edge _ ( but not a vertex ! ) , and going along it in some of directions , we arrive at a vertex which has a degree equal to @xmath80 and therefore , there exist @xmath37 different possibilities to move further .",

    "( note that the narrowness of an intervertex distance distribution also was observed in other types of networks @xcite . )",
    "4 .   at large negative @xmath471 ,",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath27 is @xmath472 .",
    "this result is evident .",
    "indeed , the average size of the @xmath15-th connected component of a vertex is @xmath473 , which holds when @xmath474 and these components are tree graphs .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath24 at large positive @xmath25 depends on the minimal vertex degree ( we assume this degree is nonzero in any case ) .",

    "we considered a two - parameter family of degree distributions .",
    "we chose @xmath486 for @xmath487 , @xmath488 , @xmath489 .",
    "a motivation for such a choice was that the function @xmath83 is a linear - rational one , which allowed us to solve the main equation ( [ 40 ] ) analytically .",
    "in section [ power ] we studied the problem : what are the statistics of intervertex distances in the networks with the finite first and divergent second moments of the degree distribution ?",
    "we introduced a degree distribution , which behaves as @xmath490 , @xmath39 , at large degrees @xmath37 .",

    "we found the leading contributions to the size distribution for the @xmath15-th connected component and , consequently , to the intervertex distance distribution in this limit .",
    "the results may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the mean intervertex distance is given by : @xmath492 note that here @xmath42 , and @xmath493 is kept small but finite , so the first term on the right - hand part is the leading one .",
    "the intervertex distance distribution actually depends on @xmath494 , and the form of this dependence ( see eq .",
    "( [ 2790 ] ) ) appears to be independent of the cut - off position .",
    "the mean square deviation of the distances ( eq . (",
    "[ 2910 ] ) ) is again a finite number , it depends neither on the network size nor on the cut - off .",

    "now let us discuss the problem : under what conditions these results remain true if one simultaneously tends to infinity both the size of the system and the position of the cut - off in the degree distribution .",
    "that is , simultaneously , @xmath42 and @xmath497 .",
    "the main question studied in this paper is : how does the size distribution of the @xmath15-th connected component changes with its number @xmath15 ? in @xmath77-representation , at sufficiently small @xmath15 , this evolution is described by eq .",

    "we replace this equation with eq .",

    "this is satisfied if at least @xmath505 . the condition for the replacement of the evolution equation ( [ 30 ] ) with its asymptotical form means that the functions @xmath506 and @xmath507 can be reduced to each other by the rescaling of the independent variable , @xmath508 .",
    "this is true , if after @xmath15 iterations of the interval of linearity of the function @xmath83 , @xmath509 , @xmath510 , the resulting interval @xmath511 nearly coincides with its limit at @xmath95 , @xmath512 . in other words",

    "if this dependence satisfies the condition ( [ c50 ] ) , the results of section [ power ] are applicable .",
    "that is , as the network size increases , the intervertex distance distribution eventually assumes @xmath0-independent shape , but centered at @xmath527 , where @xmath528 . when the position ( degree ) of the cut - off grows with @xmath0 faster than that on the boundary of applicability of the approach",
