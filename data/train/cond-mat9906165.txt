    "condensates of weakly interacting bose gases at zero temperature are well described by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as it is a nonlinear schrdinger equation for a macroscopic wavefunction it not only accounts for the density properties but also for the coherence inherent in bose condensates . in @xcite a generalization of the gpe",
    "was introduced to treat a system of trapped and untrapped states of a bose gas coupled via an rf field with a frequency @xmath1 . here , we want to model an atom laser for rb-87 in its @xmath2 or @xmath3 hyperfine - manifold .",

    "the total density devided by the number @xmath11 of atoms in the system is denoted by @xmath12 ( we normalize to 1 , not to n ) .",
    "the rabi frequency is determined by the strength @xmath13 of the rf - field and given by @xmath14 .",
    "it is modified by the matrix elements of the angular operators @xmath15 represented by @xmath16 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "this results in @xmath17 ; for @xmath2 , @xmath18 takes values 2 and @xmath19 depending on @xmath20 so the rabi frequencies differ for different @xmath21 transitions .",
    "ioffe - type traps often used in experiments are usually elongated in the horizontal plane being axial symetric in the remaining directions .",
    "as mentioned above , we want to model an atom laser based on such traps by 1d gpes where the axis under consideration is the vertical axis of the trap .",
    "we choose coordinates where the @xmath0-axis points _ downwards _ , the long axis of the trap is denoted by @xmath22 , the short horizontal one by @xmath23 .",
    "taking gravity into account , the total effective potentials in @xmath0-direction then are given by    @xmath24    @xmath25 is simply the detuning of the transitions ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath3 and @xmath28 for @xmath2 ) .    the effective interaction strength @xmath29 is determined in such a way that the chemical potential in thomas - fermi approximation in the 1d model equals that for the full 3d situation for @xmath11 particles in a trapped state @xmath30 .",
    "it turns out to be equal to @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",

    "( [ eq : gpe3d ] ) now reads @xmath33    gravitation leads to a _",
    "sag _ of the trapped atomic cloud .",
    "the shift of the minimum of the potentials away from the trap center at @xmath34 depends on @xmath20 and is given by @xmath35",
    ". the effective potentials always cross at @xmath36 .",
    "usually , only the positive sign plays a role because the negative value is outside the condensate ( cf .",
    "inset in fig .",
    "( [ fig : effpots ] ) ) .",
    "= 0.5    for weak coupling @xmath37 the trapped atoms are only disturbed slightly by the outcoupling process @xcite , after a certain propagation time the wavefunctions are quasi - stationary . in fig .",
    "[ fig : effpots ] we plot the densities of the @xmath38 states for @xmath3 in such a situation .",
    "the outcoupling takes place primarily at the resonance point @xmath39 .",
    "the untrapped state can be approximated by an airy function , its strength being determined by the outcoupling rate which is known analytically @xcite .",
    "why is the location of maximal outcoupling identical to @xmath39 ?",
    "this is not so obvious ; if one considers the same situation without the mean - field contribution in @xmath40 , the density maximum of the untrapped state is located at the classical turning point in its potential , which depends on the energy ( analogous to photo - dissociation of molecules ) . if the mean - field contribution is present like in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe1d ] ) the classical turning point is shifted to the resonance point @xmath39 ( see inset in fig .",
    "( [ fig : effpots ] ) ) , and hence the point of maximum density coincides with @xmath39 .",
    "in this section we present some numerical results obtained by propagating the set of coupled gpes eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpe1d ] ) and compare them to experimental data for the same set of parameters .",
    "the time propagation was accomplished by a usual split - operator method using fft on a 1d  grid .",
    "the starting condition is always the condensate ground state obtained by imaginary time propagation .",
    "the basic parameters in our calculations are taken from @xcite , the @xmath41-state is trapped with frequencies @xmath42 and @xmath43 . throughout the paper we use harmonic oszillator units with respect to the @xmath44 trapping frequency for the vertical motion @xmath45 which happens to be the same for both @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , the length unit is @xmath47 , time is measured in @xmath48 .",
    "the rabi frequencies used in @xcite are all bigger than @xmath49 , so we are not in a weak coupling regime . during the outcoupling process ,",
    "the condensate is depleted significantly . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : timeevol ] ) , one can see how fast this takes place .",
    "the populations of the states show some small oscillations that are reminiscent of the rabi oscillations occuring at very strong rf fields where there is hardly no outcoupling @xcite .",
    "such oscillations can be seen in experiment as a sort of pulses @xcite .",

    "al . presented measurements of the number of particles remaining in the @xmath50-state after a fixed time of outcoupling depending both on the strength and the frequency of the radio freqency .",
    "figures  ( [ fig : f2omega ] ) and ( [ fig : f2omegaspec ] ) display our numerical data for their parameters and the experimental values . in the calculations we took only the @xmath51-states into account .",
    "tests with more states show that this is enough , as the missing @xmath52-states are populated only very weakly .",
    "= 0.5    = 0.5    the theoretical values fit the experimental data at least qualitatively .",
    "the differences are most probably due to dimensional effects : in the 1d model there is only a resonance point at @xmath39 , whereas in 3d the outcoupling takes place on a resonance surface defined by the distance @xmath53 to the trap center .",
    "accordingly , the outcoupling rate in 3d depends on the density of the trapped state averaged over the resonance surface which is smaller than the density on the @xmath0-axis .",
    "thus , the outcoupling yield in 3d is smaller than in 1d because there is only the `` on - axis '' density .",
    "this effect is even stronger for the @xmath3 results shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : f1omegaspec ] ) ; the experimental data are again from the hnsch group @xcite . in this case , all three zeeman sublevels were propagated because they are all significantly populated .",
    "( see e.g. fig .",
    "( [ fig : timeevol ] ) ) .",
    "we have tried to quantify the aforementioned difference between the 1d- and 3d - situation including gravity at least in the weak coupling limit in the spirit of the perturbational rates from @xcite but have not found a conclusive answer .",
    "= 0.5    a closer look on the spectral data in figs .",
    "( [ fig : f2omegaspec ] ) and ( [ fig : f1omegaspec ] ) reveals two further details : from a weak coupling analysis one expects the curves in these figures to reflect directly the density distribution of the trapped states transfered to the frequency domain via @xmath54 .",
    "this leads to an asymmetry around the minimum that can be seen in the curve at weaker coupling shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : f1omegaspec ] ) .",
    "the second detail concerns the small bump visible in the `` theory''-curve in fig .",
    "( [ fig : f1omegaspec ] ) around @xmath55 .",
    "it occurs only for intermediate couplings .",
    "we have no explanation for this feature .",
    "in this paper , we have described a numerical analysis for an rf - atom laser .",
    "the output yield of such a device can be determined in a satisfactory way though the restriction to one dimension does not allow for a exact quantitative comparison with the real world data form experiment .",
    "what is lacking is a more analytical treatment of the outcoupling process for intermediate coupling strengths , which would probably also explain the bump in fig .",
    "( [ fig : f1omegaspec ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it would be nice to have a at least 2d picture for the outcoupled wavefunction to discuss things like the beam divergence",
    ". a 2d treatment would also be able to account for the long axis of the trap where collective excitations of the condensate can occur much easier than in the other two directions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another intersting subject is an atom laser driven by two radio frequencies .",
    "this may lead to a pulsed operation mode like in a mode - locked laser .",
    "we are investigating such setups , results will be published elsewhere .",
