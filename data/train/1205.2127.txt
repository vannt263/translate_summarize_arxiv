    "in this paper , which is the second part of work begun in @xcite , we present applications of the theoretical regularity results in the first part of this paper to finite element method approximation schemes .",
    "the first application is to approximation of eigenvalues , @xmath19 , and eigenfunctions , @xmath20 , of the bloch operator , @xmath16 , associated to a periodic hamiltonian operator with inverse square potential at isolated points .",
    "for example , one of our main results , theorem [ athm1.eig ] yields optimal orders of convergence for the finite element approximations of the eigenvalues of @xmath16 using graded meshes .",
    "these rates are higher than those that can be obtained using standard meshes .",
    "the second application is to the finite element method , again using graded meshes , applied to equations of the form @xmath21 .",
    "the final section of this paper presents numerical tests showing good agreement with our theoretical results for this second problem .",
    "hamiltonian operators with inverse square potentials arise in a variety of interesting contexts .",
    "the standard example of a schrdinger operator with @xmath22 potential is a special case of the inverse square potentials we consider , where the function @xmath23 vanishes to order 1 at the singularity , and the results of this work apply to such operators .",
    "but in addition , hamiltonians with true inverse square potentials arise in relativistic quantum mechanics from the square of the dirac operator coupled with an interaction potential , and they arise in the interaction of a polar molecule with an electron .",
    "see @xcite for further applications of inverse square potentials to physics .",
    "see also @xcite for related results on operators with singular coefficients .",
    "thus it is interesting in several areas of physics to understand how to approximate solutions to equations involving such operators .    before we can state our approximation results",
    ", we must fix some notation and state the assumptions we make about our hamiltonian operators . consider a hamiltonian operator @xmath24 that is periodic on @xmath25 with triclinic periodicity lattice @xmath11 .",
    "its fundamental domain is a parallelopiped whose faces can be identified under the symmetries of @xmath17 to form the torus @xmath26 , which is how we will denote this fundamental domain in the remainder of this paper .",
    "let @xmath27 be a continuous function on @xmath28 that is given by @xmath29 for @xmath5 close to @xmath6 , is smooth except at the points of @xmath2 , and may be assumed to be equal to one outside a neighbourhood of @xmath2 .",
    "we need two assumptions about the potentials @xmath0 that we will consider in this paper .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath0 is smooth except at a set of points @xmath30 , near which it has singularities of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath7 is continuous on @xmath28 and smooth in polar coordinates around @xmath6 .",
    "we denote this as follows .",
    "@xmath31 assumption 1 , more precisely the continuity of @xmath7 at @xmath2 , allows us to formulate our second assumption .",
    "namely , @xmath32 in particular , we assume that for all @xmath9 , @xmath8",
    ". these assumptions are sharp in the sense that the analysis yields fundamentally different results if either one fails .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath33 corresponds to the critical coupling for an isolated inverse square potential in @xmath25 where the system undergoes a transition between the conformal and non - conformal regimes @xcite .",
    "if the first assumption fails , then the available analytic techniques are much weaker , see for instance @xcite . in either case ,",
    "the approximation theorems in this paper fail if either assumption is violated .",
    "more details of this are included in the first part , @xcite , and a study of the analysis when these assumptions are relaxed will be examined in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we are interested in understanding the spectrum and generalised eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath17 . as usual , we do this by studying bloch waves . recall that if @xmath15 is an element of the first brillion zone of @xmath11 , that is , is an element of the fundamental domain of the dual lattice of @xmath11 , then a bloch wave with wave vector @xmath15 is a function in @xmath34 that satisfies the semi - periodicity condition @xmath35 it is well known that such a bloch wave can be written as @xmath36 for a function @xmath37 that is truly periodic with respect to @xmath11 and thus can be considered as living on the three - torus @xmath38 .",
    "we define the @xmath15hamiltonian @xmath16 on @xmath14 by @xmath39 then we have further that if a bloch wave @xmath40 is a generalized eigenfunction of @xmath17 with generalized eigenvalue @xmath19 , then the function @xmath41 is a standard @xmath42-eigenfunction of @xmath16 with eigenvalue @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath43 , @xmath44 , be the eigenvalues of @xmath16 , arranged in increasing order , @xmath45 , and repeated according to their multiplicities .",
    "that is , if @xmath46 denotes the eigenspace of @xmath16 corresponding to @xmath19 , then @xmath19 is repeated @xmath47 times .    as usual , for our finite element approximation results",
    ", we consider a sequence @xmath48 of finite dimensional subspaces of the domain of @xmath16 and let @xmath49 denote the riesz projection onto @xmath50 , that is , the projection in the bilinear form @xmath51 , ( for a suitable @xmath52 ) , associated to @xmath16 .",

    "we describe the meshing refinement procedure in detail in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we will take @xmath61 the finite element spaces associated to these meshes ( _ i.e. , _ using continuous , piecewise polynomials of degree @xmath62 ) .    our first theorem , which is a theoretical result for the finite element method approximation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath16 using tetrahedralisations with graded meshes , is as follows .",

    ", we consider the finite element approximations of the equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the constant from theorem [ theorem1 ] below .",
    "we then define the form @xmath77 and let @xmath78 be the solution of equation above .",
    "we then define the usual galerkin finite element approximation @xmath79 of @xmath78 as the unique @xmath80 such that @xmath81    then theorem [ athm1.eig]together with the lax - milgram lemma and cea s lemma imply that we have the following @xmath82 quasi - optimal rate of convergence .",

    "the sequence @xmath87 of finite element ( galerkin ) approximations of @xmath78 from equation satisfies @xmath88 where @xmath89 is independent of @xmath70 and @xmath90 .",
    "these theorems are interesting because it is known that the convergence rate of a standard finite element method ( _ i.e. , _ based on quasi - uniform meshes ) is limited .",
    "however , under the assumptions on our potentials , if we use graded meshes instead , we can obtain an approximation rate as fast as we like by using polynomials of sufficiently high degree in the elements .",
    "this is due to the fact that although regularity of the associated bloch waves is limited in terms of standard sobolev spaces on @xmath38 , it is arbitrarily good with respect to weighted sobolev spaces .",
    "we will recall the definition of these spaces and the relevant regularity results from @xcite along with additional background in section [ sec : background ] .",

    "we discuss results of numerical tests of the method for solving equations of the form @xmath91 and compare them to the theoretical results .",

    "in this section we recall some definitions and results from @xcite , as well as the classical approximation result for lagrange interpolants ( see @xcite ) , that will be used in the proofs of the approximation theorems above .",
    "first , these results are given in terms of weighted sobolev spaces which are defined as follows : @xmath92 these spaces have been considered in many other papers , most notably in kondratiev s groundbreaking paper @xcite .",
    "the first result that we recall guarantees the existence of solutions of equations of the form @xmath93 for @xmath94 greater than some constant @xmath76 , and identifies the natural domain of @xmath16 .",
