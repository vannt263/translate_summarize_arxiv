    "there is plenty of evidence that the center of our galaxy hosts a massive black hole with a mass of approximately 4 @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 at a distance of about 8 kpc .",
    "the compact radio source sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) , located in the galactic center is believed to be associated with this black hole .",
    "the measurements of the proper motion of sgr a * showed that sgr a * must contain @xmath4 4 @xmath1 10@xmath5 m@xmath3 @xcite and provided support for the existence of a massive black hole in the vicinity of sgr a*.    the emission from sgr a * is detected at the radio , infra - red and x - ray band .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of sgr a * , which is @xmath6 @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 , is @xmath6 8.5 orders of magnitude smaller than the eddington limit for its black hole mass of @xmath6 4 @xmath1 10@xmath2 m@xmath3 in spite of the existence of the large gas reservoir from stellar winds in its vicinity .",
    "a number of theoretical models have been proposed to explain the low luminosity of sgr a*. one of the successful models that can explain the observed spectrum is radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) , which has a low radiative efficiency @xcite",
    ". one of the most improved riaf models that explains the observed spectrum phenomenologically is a solution involving substantial mass loss ( although the outflowing mass is ignored in calculating the radio emission ) and a non - thermal component of electrons @xcite .",
    "in addition to the models which explain the emission of sgr a * in terms of the accretion flow , there exist other models in which the emission of sgr a * is mainly attributed to an outflow such as sub - relativistic or relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "another model with escaping wind consisting of thermal electrons is also proposed @xcite .",
    "the apparent size of the schwarzschild radius of the black hole is about 10 @xmath9as and is the largest among black hole candidates .",
    "thus , the spatial resolution of vlbi can resolve the structure in the vicinity of the sgr a*. however , the direct imaging of the intrinsic structure of sgr a * is still difficult at the radio band due to the interstellar scattering @xcite .",
    "measurements of the apparent size of sgr a * showed that the size is proportional to @xmath10 at a wavelength longer than @xmath6 1.3 cm , while the intrinsic structure appears to be detectable at a wavelength shorter than @xmath6 1.3 cm @xcite .",
    "the frequency - dependency of the intrinsic size of sgr a * in the radio bands @xcite suggests that the intrinsic size of sgr a * at radio band is determined by the photosphere of optically thick plasma @xcite .",
    "based on the existence of the sub - mm bump in the broadband spectrum , the transition between the optically thin and optically thick regimes is expected to occur in the sub - mm band .",
    "sgr a * is known to have variabilities at radio , ir and x - ray band with time - scales ranging from intra - day to a few months .",
    "the intra - day variation of sgr a * has been studied intensively by international multi - wavelength campaigns @xcite .",
    "the radio band variability on time scales longer than a day has been discussed mainly based on observations with connected interferometers @xcite . as an origin of the variation ,",
    "both intrinsic and extrinsic models are proposed , but the mechanism of the time variation is still under discussion .",
    "interstellar scintillation is the primary mechanism that may cause extrinsic variability .",
    "previous studies suggested that if the scattering medium of sgr a * lies on a thin screen , all the observed flux variability must be intrinsic to the source itself @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , an extended scattering region may explain the broad characteristics of the variability longer than 4 days @xcite .",
    "however , the physical structures associated with this extended scattering medium is unknown .",
    "recent studies at cm / mm wavelengths reported the existence of long timescale flux variations at short , cm / mm wavelengths where interstellar effects are negligible .",
    "a massive monitoring of sgr a * with vla and the detections of high fluxes of sgr a * at mm wavelengths indicate that the flux variation at mm wavelengths is likely to be not explainable by a simple model of interstellar scattering @xcite but intrinsic @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent event horizon telescope observations discovered that flux density of sgr a * at 1.3 mm had a day - to - day variability without a variation in its size indicating a variation in a brightness temperature in innermost region of sgr a * @xcite .",
    "high spatial resolution of vlbi enables monitoring of the flux and structure in the vicinity of a black hole .",
    "hence , a monitoring observation with vlbi is of great importance to investigate a mechanism of time - variation of sgr a*. however , there have been no vlbi studies aiming to monitor the time variation of both the flux and structure of sgr a * in time scales longer than a month .",
    "previous vlbi studies on the size of sgr a * found that the intrinsic structure can be estimated from vlbi observations at a frequency higher than @xmath6 22 ghz .",
    "moreover , simultaneous observations of very long baseline array ( vlba ) and very large array ( vla ) indicated that the total flux of sgr a * obtained by a connected array tend to be over - estimated by sampling the diffuse emission from the vicinity of the sgr a * @xcite .",
    "thus , vlbi observations are most suitable for a detailed study of the long - term variation of the sgr a*. hence , in order to investigate the relation between the flux and intrinsic size of sgr a * , we have carried out the observations of sgr a * from 2004 to 2008 with vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) at 43 ghz , and here we report the results .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we describe the observations and the data reduction . in  3 ,",
    "we present observed images (  3.1.1 ) , fluxes and structures obtained from model - fitting (  3.1.2 and  3.2 ) . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss the observed time variation of the brightness temperature of sgr a*. finally , we summarize the results and discussions in  5 . throughout this paper , the mass of sgr a * @xmath11",
    "is assumed to be @xmath12 m@xmath3 , and the distance to sgr a * @xmath13 is assumed to be 8 kpc .",
    "vera observations of sgr a * at 43 ghz were regularly performed between november , 2004 and april , 2009 .",
    "the observations were done in the dual - beam mode observing sgr a * and j1745 - 2820 simultaneously for aiming at astrometry of sgr a*. nrao 530 is also observed in several scans for checking the consistency of the amplitude calibration . in this paper , we focus only on the data of sgr a*. results of the astrometry of sgr a * will be discussed elsewhere .    in some epochs",
    ", one or more stations were partly or fully missed due to system trouble or / and bad weather .",
    "since the vera array consists of only four stations , a lack of stations causes severe degrading of synthesized images , and would introduce a large error in quantities derived from images or model - fitting toward visibilities .",
    "hence , in this paper , we use the data of 10 epochs for which full stations are available under relatively good conditions .",
    "the epochs presented here are : day of year ( doy ) 294 in 2005 , 079 , 109 and 308 in 2006 , 073 , 093 and 264 of 2007 , 076 , 085 and 310 of 2008 ( october 21 of 2005 , march 20 , april 19 and",

    "the system noise temperatures at the zenith were typically 400 - 600 k through all the epochs .",
    "left - hand circular polarization ( lhcp ) signals were received and sampled with 2-bit quantization , and filtered using the vera digital filter unit @xcite .",
    "the data were recorded at a rate of 1024 mbps , providing a bandwidth of 256 mhz .",
    "one of two if - channels of 128 mhz bandwidth was assigned to sgr a * ( and also nrao 530 ) .",
    "correlation processes were performed with the mitaka fx correlation @xcite .      .",
    "[ fig : vera_uvplot ] ]    .",
    "[ fig : sgra_projplot_r08310a ] ]    ]    data reductions were carried out with the nrao astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) first , using the standard algorithms including phase and delay calibrations and fringe - fitting . a standard _ a priori _ amplitude calibration was performed using the aips task apcal based on the measurements of system temperature ( @xmath14 ) , which were obtained based on the chopper - wheel method during observations .",
    "delays and rates were determined with fringe - fitting directly to the sgr a * visibilities using the aips task fring .",
    "we set a solution interval of @xmath6 1 min and minimum s / n ratio of = 3 . to avoid false detections , we set a practical search window of 20 nsec @xmath1 50 mhz . in this search window ,",
    "the false detection probability is @xmath6 5 % .",
    "since sgr a * has still scattered broad structure at 43 ghz and its fwhm size is @xmath6 0.7 mas at 43 ghz , fringes were not detected for most visibilities observed in baselines longer than 200 m@xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig : vera_uvplot ] shows a typical uv - coverage of sgr a*. in fact , all the detected fringes are located within 200 m@xmath15 .",
    "visibilities related to the closure of mizusawa , iriki and ogasawara stations are mostly valid , while more than 70 @xmath16 of visibilities sampled with ishigaki - jima station are invalid , since ishigaki - jima station mainly provides baselines exceeding 200 m@xmath15 . as an example of the visibilities after applying all calibrations , we show the uv - distance plot of the data obtained in november 8 of 2008 ( in later sections , named as epoch ( j ) ) in figure [ fig : sgra_projplot_r08310a ] . the horizontal axis of figure [ fig : sgra_projplot_r08310a ] is the uv - distance projected along the major axis of the elliptical gaussian models of visibilities ( see , section 3.2 ) .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : sgra_projplot_r08310a ] shows that the visibility amplitude decreases with uv - distance down to @xmath6 200 mjy at 200 m@xmath15 .",
    "moreover , from the distribution of the visibility phases ( the bottom panel ) , one can see that the scatter of phases becomes larger for longer baselines , which is due to lower s / n ratio for longer baselines .",
    "the minimum detected flux in figure [ fig : sgra_projplot_r08310a ] , @xmath6 200 mjy , is comparable to the fringe detection limit of vera under typical conditions .",
    "in fact , the minimum detectable flux is @xmath6 200 mjy for s / n = 3 and @xmath17 k ) .",
    "this fact is consistent with the non - detection of fringe - fitting solutions for baselines longer than 200 m@xmath15 .",
    "after the fringe fitting , calibrated data were output to difmap .",
    "we averaged visibilities to @xmath6 60 s in difmap .",
    "we checked the closure phase of sgr a * and confirmed that the closure phase of sgr a * is obtained throughout almost all the time in each epoch , and that their s / n ratios are high enough to apply self - calibration to the visibility phases . as an example , we show the closure phases of epoch ( j ) in figure [ fig : sgra_cpplot_r08310a ] .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : sgra_cpplot_r08310a ] , closure phases of the combination of mizusawa , iriki and ogaswara stations are mostly determined , while more than 60 @xmath16 of the closure phases of the combination of mizusawa , ogasawara and ishigaki stations are missed because the sources are mostly resolved out with long baselines .",
    "two other closures including ishigaki - jima station were totally invalid . finally , we carried out imaging of sgr a * by iterating the self - calibration of visibility phase and clean using difmap .",
    "after imaging , we also conducted gaussian fitting to the calibrated visibilities , since most previous vlbi studies of sgr a * also adopted this technique .",
    "we output visibilities to text files using aips task prtuv , and fitted gaussian models to visibilities directly by using the least - square method .",
    "we confirmed that the results of gaussian fitting , which is obtained with our own code of least - square fit , coincides with the results obtained with the gaussian fitting program in difmap .    for estimating the fitting errors of gaussian parameters , we used the non - parametric percentile bootstrap method @xcite .",
    "this method is straightforward in deriving estimates of confidence intervals of fitted parameters .",
    "we briefly summarize a process of estimating confidence intervals : at first , we created a data - set which has the same number of data by re - sampling the observed visibilities allowing repetition of the data .",
    "re - sampling was simply done using a uniform random - number generator .",
    "then , we fitted the gaussian model to the new data - set and obtained a bootstrap estimate",
    ". we repeated this process 30,000 times and obtained 30,000 sets of the bootstrap estimates .",
    "the percentile bootstrap confidence limits of each parameter are obtained as the edges of the middle 99.7 @xmath16 fractions of the bootstrap estimates .",
    "we confirmed that the averages of bootstrap parameters coincides to the results of the least - square method within 1 @xmath16 .",
    "finally , the errors of each parameter are obtained as one - third of displacements between the averages of bootstrap parameters and the confidence limits , so that the obtained error corresponds to 1-@xmath0 uncertainty .",
    "the obtained errors are slightly greater than the standard errors estimated from the co - variance matrix of the least - square method .",
    "this means that the bootstrap method provides more conservative error estimates than the standard errors of the least - square method .",
    "the systematic errors of the total flux are estimated as below . in our observations , it is difficult to estimates systematic errors using calibrators , since our observations were carried out over an interval longer than one month and calibrators are also variable in such time scales .",
    "instead , we estimated 10 % of the total flux as a systematic error , and added them in quadrature to the fitting error .",
    "this is a reasonable estimate , since the amplitude calibration was done by a - priori calibration using the system temperature @xmath14 measured by the chopper - wheel method .    ]    for checking the fairness of amplitude calibration , we also analyzed nrao 530 which was observed simultaneously as an amplitude calibrator .",
    "we confirmed that the r.m.s . of gain solutions obtained from the amplitude self - calibration of nrao 530 were around or less than 10 @xmath16 for most epochs .",
    "figure [ fig : nrao530_flux ] shows the core - flux variations of nrao 530 .",
    "these core - fluxes were obtained by the elliptical gaussian - fitting to the visibilities and their errors were estimated in the same way as sgr a*. in addition to vera data , figure [ fig : nrao530_flux ] shows the core - fluxes obtained from data of the boston university blazar monitoring program with the vlba .",
    "these data were obtained by model - fitting to calibrated visibilities .",
    "figure [ fig : nrao530_flux ] suggests the trend of core - flux variation obtained from vera and vlbi is presumably consistent , though both observations were not carried out simultaneously .",
    "after model fitting , we calculated the intrinsic size of sgr a * using the total flux and the major and minor axes sizes obtained from gaussian - fitting .",
    "we estimated the major axis intrinsic size based on a traditional method used in previous vlba observations @xcite .",
    "we adopted the scattering law of @xcite , in which the scattering size @xmath18 was given by @xmath19 yielding @xmath18 of @xmath6 661 @xmath9as at 43.0 ghz . assuming that the intrinsic brightness distribution of sgr a * is elliptical gaussian , the intrinsic size @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 we note that here the scattering effect is assumed to be the same throughout all the epochs .",
    "to convert units of intrinsic size @xmath22 , one can refer to following relation between angular scale in @xmath9as and schwarzchild radius @xmath23 given by @xmath24      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we successfully measured the major - axis size @xmath25 through all the epochs .",
    "the time - average of @xmath25 is 720 @xmath9as , which is consistent with previous vlba observations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we could not determine the minor - axis size @xmath26 in several epochs .",
    "the time - average of @xmath27 and pa are about 370 @xmath9as and 78@xmath28 ( without using upper limit data ) , and also similar to previous results of vlba",
    ". however , the minor axis size and also position angle of sgr a * are possibly affected by synthesized beam ( i.e. uv coverage and spatial resolution ) .",
    "thus , it is difficult to discuss the time variation of the minor axis size and position angle .",
    "hence , in this paper , we concentrate on the variation of the flux and major axis size .",
    "remarkably , in addition to the flux variation , one can see the variation of the intrinsic size .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath29 , 0.1 jy corresponds to @xmath6 11 % of the time - averaged flux @xmath30 , while that of @xmath22 , 50 @xmath9as corresponds to @xmath6 19 % of the time - averaged intrinsic size @xmath31 .",
    "we confirmed the significance of time variations in @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath20 from @xmath34 tests of hypotheses of no time variation in those quantities .",
    "the error weighted averages of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath20 are 0.9 jy , 710 @xmath9as and 290 @xmath9as , resulting @xmath34s based on the hypotheses are 20 , 41 and 46 respectively .",
    "the @xmath34 tests based on those @xmath34s indicate that the hypotheses are rejected at the significance level of 5 @xmath16 .",
    "a noteworthy feature in figure [ fig : time variation ] is that the total flux of sgr a * was flared up to about 2 jy in may 2007 @xcite .",
    "they also reported that the fluxes at 22 ghz and 86 ghz are high in these epochs as well .",
    "compared with the results of a dense monitor in @xcite , observed fluxes of sgr a * are relatively high . in the present paper , we refer to this flaring of sgr a * as  the flaring event  .",
    "combination of our and vlba results suggests that the duration of the flaring event was longer than 10 days and shorter than 151 days .",
    "the time - averaged flux during the flaring event is 1.79 @xmath35 0.05 jy .",
    "this is about 1.7 times higher than epoch ( f ) ( @xmath6 1 month prior to the flaring event ) , and also 2.1 times higher than epoch ( g ) ( @xmath6 6 months posterior to the flaring event ) .",
    "meanwhile , the time - averaged intrinsic size during the flaring event is 267 @xmath36 @xmath9as , which is consistent with those of epochs ( f ) , ( g ) and the time - averaged value of our results within 1 @xmath0 level .",
    "this result indicates that the brightness temperature of sgr a * increased during the flaring event ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "]    the total flux and the major axis size of sgr a * were successfully measured and then they can be used for discussing the possibility of the variation in the brightness temperature @xmath37 , which is calculated by @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are intrinsic sizes of the major and minor axes . here , the brightness distribution is set to be an uniform elliptical disk .",
    "its diameter is set to be fwhm sizes of the elliptical gaussian model , ant its total flux equals to that of the elliptical gaussian model .",
    "since the minor - axis size was not determined in many epochs , we define the multiple of the brightness temperature and the minor axis intrinsic size given by @xmath41 where the normalization factor of 260 @xmath42 for the intrinsic - minor - axis size is referred to from averaged value of vlba measurements in @xcite .",
    "we show the time variation in @xmath11 in figure 7 . if the brightness temperature does not varies with time , the variation in @xmath11 should originate from that in the intrinsic minor size . here",
    ", we assume the time - averaged value of the intrinsic - minor - axis size for our vera data to be 260 @xmath9as .    in our vera results ( without vlba data ) , the constant brightness temperature requires variation in observed - minor - axis size ranged from @xmath43 @xmath9as to @xmath44 @xmath9as .",
    "it would be difficult to detect such a variation with vera considering the beam size along the n - s direction .",
    "thus , the variation in @xmath11 could be explained only by the variation in the intrinsic - minor - axis size .",
    "on the other hand , the combination of vera data and vlba data requires the increase in the brightness temperature at the flaring event .",
    "the error - weighted averages of @xmath11 are 1.0 for our vera data and 2.3 for vlba data at the flaring event .",
    "if there was no time variation in the brightness temperature through our vera data and the flaring event , the observed - minor - axis size of @xmath45 @xmath9as should have been required at the flaring event .",
    "however , @xcite reported the time - averaged minor axis size of 400 @xmath35 10 @xmath9as at the flaring event and inconsistent with predicted observed - minor - axis size of @xmath45 @xmath9as .",
    "thus , the increase in @xmath11 at the flaring event can not be explained only by variation of the intrinsic - minor - axis size , and requires the increase in the brightness temperature .",
    "the variation of the total flux and intrinsic size of sgr a * requires most likely requires the variation of the brightness temperature . before discussing this , here , we comment on the possibility of interstellar scattering as an origin of the time variations of sgr a*. since the detailed structure of the scattering medium is still unknown , it is not possible to totally rule out the effect of interstellar scattering . the scattered image of sgr a * is thought to be created by turbulent plasma along the line of sight .",
    "a typical time scale for the scattering is given by refractive time scale , which is determined by relative motions of the observer , turbulent plasma and background source .",
    "the refractive time scale for sgr a * is estimated to be @xmath6 0.5 @xmath46 year @xmath47 , given a relative velocity of 100 km s@xmath8 @xcite . at 43 ghz ,",
    "the refractive time scale becomes @xmath6 3 months .",
    "most of our observations are separated by periods longer than 3 months , implying that the time variations of the total flux may be partly caused by refractive changes .",
    "however , epochs ( e ) , ( f ) and the flaring event reported by @xcite are separated by only a month ( see figure [ fig : time variation ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xcite reported that the spectral index became harder than previous results . in simple models of interstellar scattering ,",
    "the modulation index of the flux density decreases with frequency in a strong scattering regime @xcite .",
    "this would lead to an anti - correlation between spectral index and mm - flux .",
    "therefore , the flaring event is inconsistent with the effects of simple models for interstellar scintillation .",
    "thus , observed variation of brightness temperature is likely intrinsic . in the following subsections , assuming that the flaring event in @xcite is intrinsic , we discuss possible intrinsic origins of the flaring event in 2007 .      here , we discuss whether the brightness temperature variation associated with the flaring event can be explained by models suggested for intra - day variations . in previous studies ,",
    "several models were proposed as the origin of intra - day variation , such as models with jet @xcite , expanding plasmon model @xcite and orbiting hot - spot model @xcite .",
    "both vera and vlba have not detected any additional components in the sgr a * images around the flaring event in 2007 . from this fact ,",
    "an ejection of a sub - relativistic or relativistic bright component @xcite would be ruled out in this case .",
    "the size of sgr a * at 43 ghz is about 0.7 mas along the major axis , corresponding to a light crossing time of @xmath6 46 min .",
    "if the flaring event is owing to an ejection of an outflow or a jet , the velocity of the new component must be less than 0.003 c so that the new component can not be resolved from the persistent component within 10 days .",
    "this velocity upper - limit is significantly smaller than the predicted value of 0.1c in @xcite .    the expanding plasmon model @xcite , in which creation of an expanding plasma blob causes flux variation , predicts an expansion velocity comparable to the upper limit of 0.003 c in case of the intra - day variation of sgr a * @xcite .",
    "however , when the expansion velocity is comparable to 0.003 c , the adiabatic cooling time - scale is shorter than a day .",
    "if the expansion velocity is smaller than 0.003 c , the adiabatic cooling time - scale can be longer .",
    "however , in such a case , the synchrotron cooling dominates the adiabatic cooling .",
    "according to @xcite , the synchrotron cooling time - scale is given by @xmath48 in previous studies , typical magnetic - field strength is estimated to be around or larger than 10 g @xcite . if the magnetic - field strength of 10 g is adopted , the flux decay time - scale at 86 ghz is much shorter than 10 days , which contradicts the results of @xcite .",
    "the observed vlbi structure presumably does not favor the expanding plasmon model .",
    "as described in section 3 , the total flux of 22 ghz also increased in the flaring event @xcite .",
    "if the expanding plasmon is the origin of the flaring event , this hot plasma should be generated outside of the 22-ghz photosphere .",
    "a typical intrinsic size of sgr a * is 74 r@xmath49 or 0.73 mas at 22 ghz @xcite . if there is a bright component outside of the radio - photosphere at 22 ghz , its should be resolved in vlbi maps at 43 ghz or 86 ghz , being inconsistent with the results in the present paper .",
    "for the same reason , it is unlikely that the flux increase is caused by an orbiting hot spot @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the models with new components emerged in optically - thin regions would not be able to explain the flaring event .",
    "finally , we note that the persistent jet model @xcite is not ruled out .",
    "most likely , it is difficult to explain such a flux variation by newly emerged components , but it could be explained assuming that , for example , the flux variation is owing to the variation of the photosphere of the jet core .      the models with additional bright components would be not suitable for explaining the flaring event . hence , the flaring event is likely to be associated with a brightness increase of the photosphere . compared with the light crossing time and keplerian orbital period , the flaring event had much longer duration .",
    "this fact suggests that the flaring event is likely owing to an event that establishes a new steady state in sgr a * s accretion disk .",
    "the existence of the high density state of sgr a * is also suggested by @xcite based on the preliminary bimodal distribution of flux density .",
    "moreover , recent event horizon telescope observations @xcite found also such an establishment of new steady state with higher brightness temperature at 1.3 mm .",
    "thus , the flaring event may be possibly caused by such a new steady state .    according to accretion disk models , an electron energy distribution and its spatial dependency are crucial for determining the radio emission of sgr a*. however , the detailed properties of these have been unclear . for instance , some models succeeded in explaining the radio spectrum of sgr a * by emission from thermal electrons @xcite , while other models fail to explain the radio spectrum of sgr a * using only thermal electrons @xcite and need non - thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent theoretical studies imply that true electron distribution functions contain non - thermal components @xcite .",
    "thus , at present we should consider both thermal and non - thermal electrons for the radio emission of sgr a*.    thermal electrons are probably not suitable for explaining the flaring event based on a self - similar riaf model .",
    "if the flaring event is established by emission from thermal electrons , an increase in brightness temperature means increase in the electron temperature , since thermal synchrotron emission at 43 ghz is thought to be optically thick . according to studies of self - similar adaf model @xcite , an electron temperature @xmath50 in adaf has a dependency of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a mass accretion rate .",
    "this dependency is not changed even in the self - similar adios model .",
    "thus , an increase in the electron temperature needs a larger decrease in the mass accretion rate . on the other hand , because the luminosity of a riaf disk is proportional to @xmath53 @xcite , the radio flux should decrease as the mass accretion rate decreases .",
    "this is inconsistent with our observational results that both the brightness temperature and the total flux increased at the flaring event .",
    "thus , based on theoretical studies of self - similar riaf , thermal electron origin is not favored .",
    "however , since the electron temperature profile , which seriously affects the radio emission , is poorly constrained , our results might be explained by a new steady electron temperature profile , for instance , owing to standing shock in accretion disk @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent numerical grmhd simulations suggest that a scaling law between the radio flux and the mass accretion rate is slightly different from that of self - similar riaf model @xcite .",
    "future numerical studies might explain this flaring event with only thermal electrons .",
    "non - thermal electrons could be the origin of that .",
    "recent axis - symmetric particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation of the collision - less magnetic - rotational - instability ( mri ) shows that mri in riaf causes magnetic re - connections and that non - thermal components can be produced by magnetic re - connections @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed production mechanism of stationary non - thermal components has been unclear .",
    "at least , a single event of electron acceleration is not favored (  4.2.1 ) , but the mechanism of continuous injection of accelerated electrons should be required .",
    "a standing shock in the accretion disk @xcite might explain continuous acceleration of electrons .    in summary , as the origin of the flared emission at the flaring event , thermal electrons",
    "is not thermal electrons are not favored based on a self - similar riaf model .",
    "however , an establishment of a new steady electron temperature profile or future numerical grmhd simulation might explain the flaring events .",
    "non - thermal electrons could explain the flaring event assuming a continuous production mechanism of non - thermal electrons such as a standing shock in accretion disk .",
    "simultaneous measurements of detailed radio spectra varied from cm to sub - mm wavelengths would be helpful to constrain the properties of electron distribution at the flaring event .",
    "we presented the results of multi - epoch vera observations of sgr a * at 43 ghz performed from 2005 to 2008 .",
    "observed images showed that sgr a * has only one component for about 3 years and we did not detect any significant structural changes such as a creation of new jet components through all epochs .",
    "based on the analyses with gaussian fitting to the observed visibilities , we detected time variations of the total flux and the intrinsic size . by combining the results of vlba and vera observations , we found the flaring events at least longer than 10 days . furthermore , we succeed in determining the intrinsic size before / after the flaring event .",
    "our measurements indicate that the intrinsic sizes remained unchanged within 1 @xmath0 level from the sizes before / after the flaring event , indicating that the brightness temperature of sgr a * had been increased at the flaring event .",
    "the flaring event of sgr a * in 2007 occurred within one month , which is less than the typical reflective time - scale of interstellar scattering at 43 ghz .",
    "moreover , the correlation between spectral index and flux densities reported in @xcite can not be explained from simple models of interstellar scattering .",
    "thus , the flaring event is likely to be intrinsic . considering the features of the observed images and the cooling time - scale of electrons ,",
    "it is unlikely that the flaring event is associated with an ejection of relativistic component or a temporal one - shot plasma heating such as an expanding plasma blob or a hotspot orbiting around the central black hole .",
    "thus , the flaring event is likely to be associated with a brightness increase of the photosphere .",
    "following self - similar adaf @xcite , our results do not favor the change of thermal electron temperature as the origin .",
    "to explain the flaring event , it needs a mechanism of heating electrons continuously for much longer than orbital periods of accretion disk such as a standing shock in an accretion flow . in future , simultaneous measurements of detailed radio spectra varying from cm to sub - mm wavelengths",
    "would be helpful to constrain the property of electron distribution at the flaring event .",
