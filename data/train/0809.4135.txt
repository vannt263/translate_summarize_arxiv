    "the large scale structure of the universe , as depicted from galaxy surveys , weak lensing mapping and numerical simulations , shows a web like three dimensional structure .",
    "there are three features that can be generally observed .",
    "first , most of the volume resides in underdense regions ; second , most of the volume is permeated by filaments ; third , the densest clumps are located at the intersection of filaments @xcite .",
    "this motivates a classification of the cosmic web into at least three categories : voids ( underdense regions ) , filaments and knots ( densest clumps ) .",
    "there are clear evidences for the correlations of the observed properties of galaxies with the environment .",
    "we have for instance the morphology density correlation , where elliptical galaxies are found preferentially in crowded environments , and spiral galaxies are found in the field @xcite .",
    "the same kind of correlation can be found in terms of the colors of the galaxies @xcite .    according to the current paradigm of structure formation galaxies form and evolve in dark matter ( dm ) halos @xcite .",
    "it follows that the study of such environmental dependence should commence with the effort to understand the formation of dm halos in the context of the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to search for a robust and meaningful method to classify the different environments in numerical simulations .",
    "such a classification should provide the framework for studying the environmental dependence of galaxy formation .",
    "translating the visual impression into an algorithm that classifies the local geometry into different environments is not a trivial task . a somewhat less challenging , yet very closely related",
    ", task is that of identifying just the voids out of the cosmic web . a thorough",
    "review and comparison of different algorithms of void finders has been recently presented in @xcite .",
    "the void finders can be classified according to the method employed .",
    "most are based on the point distribution of galaxies or dark matter ( dm ) halos and some on the smoothed density or potential fields .",
    "some of the finders are based on spherical filters while others assume no inherent symmetry .",
    "it should be emphasized that an environment finder should be evaluated by its merits and it can not be labeled as correct or wrong .",
    "a good algorithm should provide a quantitative classification which agrees with the visual impression and it should be based on a robust and well defined numerical scheme .",
    "yet , it is desirable for an algorithm to be based on an analytical prescription so that its outcome can be calculated analytically .",
    "also , simplicity is always very highly desired .",
    "a variety of approaches have been employed in the classification of the cosmic environment into its basic elements . the simplest way is based on the association of the environment with the local density , evaluated with a top - hat filter , say , of some width @xcite .",
    "the density field can be analyzed in a much more sophisticated and elaborated way .",
    "this is the case of the web classification based on the multi - scale analysis of the hessian matrix of the density field or the skeleton analysis of the density field @xcite .",
    "both methods classify the cosmic web by pure geometrical tools applied to the density field .",
    "a very different approach is done within a dynamical framework in which the analysis of the gravitational potential is used to classify the web .",
    "this has been inspired by the seminal work of that led to the `` russian school of structure formation '' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the quasi - linear theory of the zeldovich approximation predicts the existence of an infinitely connected web of pancakes ( i.e. sheets ) , filaments and knots . this morphological classification is based on the study of the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor , namely the hessian matrix of the linear gravitational field .",
    "a recent application of the zeldovich - based classification has been provided by @xcite who used a wiener filter linear reconstruction of the local density field and evaluated the linear deformation , and hence also the shear , tensor on a grid .",
    "the cosmic web has been classified according the structure of the shear tensor .",
    "a different approach has been followed by @xcite who suggested that the full non - linear gravitational potential should be used for the geometrical classification . apart from the difference between the linear and the non - linear potential , both @xcite and @xcite are using the same classification .",
    "namely , the hessian of the gravitational potential is evaluated on a grid and its eigenvalues are examined locally .",
    "a grid point is classified as a void , sheet , filament or knot point if the number of eigenvalues greater that a null threshold is zero , one , two or three .",
    "the algorithm presented here is an extension and improvement of the one suggested by @xcite .",
    "the extension is represented in the selection of a new free parameter with a dynamical interpretation . as such it provides a classification of local environment .",
    "namely each spatial point is flagged as belonging to a either a void , sheet , filament or a knot point .",
    "it is the collective classification of all points in space which gives rise to the geometrical construction we call the cosmic web .",
    "this opens the door for defining voids , sheets , filaments and knots as individual objects .",
    "each object is defined as a collecion of connected points having the same environmental attribute .",
    "we use a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm to find connected sets of points in simulations .",
    "having defined the web objects the statistical and dynamical properties of these can be readily studied . here",
    "we shall focus on analyzing the statistical properties of the voids and filaments , aiming to better constrain the value for the free parameter we introduce .",
    "we perform as well a statistical study to asses effect of the cosmic variance on our conclusions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the web classification scheme is described in  [ sec : web ] .",
    "the n - body simulation used in the paper and the numerical implementation of the web classification are presented in ",
    "[ sec : n - body ] . ",
    "[ sec : res - web ] describes the main properties of the cosmic web and in particular its dependence on the smoothing scale and the free parameter of our classification scheme . ",
    "[ sec : res - void ] concentrates on the properties of the voids sector of the cosmic web .",
    " [ sec : frag - filament ] studies the fragmentation of filaments in order to give a confidence interval to the free parameter that was introduced . in  [ sec : cosmic - variance ] we revisit the sections  [ sec : res - web ] and  [ sec : res - void ] to study the effect of cosmic variance .",
    "the paper concludes with a general discussion and a summary of the main results of the paper (  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested a new dynamical classification of the cosmic web .",
    "the basic idea of their approach is that the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor determine the geometrical nature of each point in space .",
    "the deformation tensor , @xmath3 , is defined by the hessian of the gravitational potential @xmath4 : @xmath5    the definition of the deformation tensor tensor the tidal tensor. usually the tidal tensor is defined as the traceless part of @xmath6 . ] explicitly assumes that the matter density field is known and that it is smoothed with a finite kernel , or otherwise the derivatives are not defined . for simplicity the smoothed density field",
    "is defined over a ( cartesian ) grid .",
    "@xcite considered the three eigenvalues of the deformation tensor , @xmath7 , and classified a grid point according the number of positive eigenvalues at that point .",
    "namely , a void point corresponds to no positive eigenvalues , a sheet to one , a filament to two and a knot point to three positive eigenvalues .",
    "the sign of a given eigenvalue at a given grid node determines whether the gravitational force at the direction of the principal direction of the corresponding eigenvector is contracting ( positive eigenvalue ) or expanding ( negative ) .",
    "@xcite provided a very attractive approach to the web classification problem .",
    "it is based on the dynamical nature of the web , and so it easily lends itself to a theoretical analysis .",
    "the ease of its application to cosmological simulations opens the door for a new framework for associating the properties of galaxies and dark matter with environment , as defined by the web classification .",
    "close inspection of the @xcite classification scheme and its results reveals its shortcomings .",
    "the volume filling factor of @xcite voids is very small . for their minimal smoothing scale ,",
    "namely the highest resolution , the voids occupy only @xmath8 of the simulated volume .",
    "this stands in contrast to the visual impression of voids in the actual universe and in simulation , where voids seems to occupy most of the volume but contain only a small fraction of the galaxies ( in observations ) or matter ( in simulations ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite classification does not reproduce the visual perception of the cosmic web .",
    "it is easy to understand the inability of the @xcite approach to reproduce the visual impression .",
    "the web classification is based on the algebraic sign of the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor , namely the number of eigenvalues larger than a threshold value of zero .",
    "it follows that if an eigenvalue is only infinitesimally positive , the scheme assumes that the local neighborhood of the given grid point collapses along the corresponding eigenvector . yet",
    ", the collapse proceeds over the dynamical time scale and if the value of the eigenvector is small enough the collapse will occur , if at all , only in the distant future .",
    "visual inspection would not classify the region as collapsing at the present time .",
    "this leads us to consider an alternative approach , namely asking the eigenvalues to be larger than a positive threshold .",
    "seeing that the dimensionality of the deformation tensor is @xmath9^{-2}$ ] , its eigenvalues can be associated with the collapse time .",
    "it follows that the threshold value should be roughly determined by equating the collapse time with the age of the universe . in appendix",
    "[ app : setting ] we rewrite the eigenvectors of the deformation tensor in a dimensionless way . in such a presentation one expects @xmath10 , where @xmath0 is the threshold value . for an isotropic collapse @xmath0",
    "can be calculated explicitly ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tff ] ) - ( [ eq : final ] ) ) .",
    "however , this provides a very rough guide as the collapse on the web is clearly not isotropic . here",
    ", an empirical approach is to be used and @xmath0 is to be roughly determined from the geometrical nature of the cosmic web it defines .",
    "we use two numerical simulation .",
    "the first assumes a wmap3 cosmology @xcite with a matter density @xmath11 , a cosmological constant @xmath12 , a dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath13 , a spectral index of primordial density perturbations @xmath14 and a normalization of @xmath15 .",
    "a simulation of box size @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles has been assumed , corresponding to a particle mass of @xmath18 .",
    "starting at redshift @xmath19 the evolution is followed using the mpi version of the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) code described in @xcite .",
    "the simulation used here is actually a constrained simulation of the local universe which is to be described at length at the forthcoming yepes et al paper ( in preparation ) .",
    "this is an updated and higher resolution version of the constrained simulation presented in @xcite . here",
    "the simulation is treated as just a random one and its constrained nature is completely ignored .    in order to estimate cosmic variance effects",
    "we have used a numerical simulation of box size @xmath20 .",
    "the assumed cosmology for this simulation is wmap3-like with a matter density @xmath21 , a cosmological constant @xmath22 , a dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath23 , a spectral index @xmath24 , a normalization @xmath25 and @xmath17 particles corresponding to a particle mass of @xmath26 .",
    "the simulation was performed using the art code as well .",
    "the analysis of the simulations proceeds as follows .",
    "the density field of the @xmath27 simulation is calculated from the particle distribution on a @xmath28 grid using the cloud - in - cell ( cic ) scheme , it is then smoothed with a gaussian kernel of width @xmath29 and from which the deformation tensor is calculated directly , using an fft solver .",
    "the deformation tensor is then diagonalized on the grid",
    ". the web characteristic of each grid point is determined by the number of eigenvectors , at that grid node , above the threshold .",
    "it should be realized that the classification is local by its nature , but the combined effect of all grid points results in the geometrical construction defined as the cosmic web .    in the @xmath30 simulation",
    "we followed the same procedure , interpolating first the density on a @xmath31 grid .",
    "once the environment detection procedure is done we select @xmath32 non - intersecting sub - boxes of @xmath27 on a side to test the effect of cosmic variance .",
    "figure [ fig : dens_field ] presents the cic density field and the cosmic web evaluated at the threshold values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the web is presented by a grey scale corresponding to the four web types , it is evaluated at a gaussian smoothing of @xmath35 in the figure [ fig : dens_field ] .",
    "the density field and the cosmic web are evaluated on a plane of the cic grid .",
    "visual inspection of the density field reveals a network of voids , filaments and dense knots .",
    "the density field is evaluated on a thin plane and therefore no clean distinction can be made between the 3-dimensional filaments and sheets .",
    "the web defined by @xmath36 consists of many small isolated voids that occupy only a small fraction of the total area of the plane .",
    "only as @xmath0 increases the voids get bigger and connected and they become the dominant geometrical component of the web .    the non - zero threshold classification provides a better visual match to the density field than the null case . a qualitative analysis and comparison",
    "is presented in  [ sec : res - web ] .",
    "the analysis is based on two quantities : the volume occupied by each web type ( volume filling fraction - vff ) and the fraction of mass contained in such a volume ( mass filling fraction - mff ) .",
    "a characterization of the cosmic web is obtained by grouping , by a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm , neighboring grid points of a given web type into individual objects .",
    "the resulting objects are defined as voids , sheets , filaments and knots .",
    "the fof association proceeds in the following way : the centers of the cells in the grid are used as the position of four different kinds of particles according to its web type , then a standard fof is run over particles of the same kind with a linking length @xmath37 times the grid length .",
    "it means that only the six closest neighbors of a given cell are taken into account .",
    "the fof void detection is done for different simulations : the @xmath16 simulation , the @xmath30 simulation and 216 sub - boxes of @xmath16 on a side extracted from the largest simulation . to be consistent in the analysis of these three kinds of simulations",
    ", one should make the fof detection _ without _ considering the periodic boundary conditions , as it is the right boundary condition for the sub - volumes extracted from the @xmath30 simulation .",
    "the fof algorithm is used to detect voids for different threshold values in the different simulations which are smoothed with the same physical scale @xmath38 in order to allow a fair comparison between them . in  [ sec : res - void ] a detailed analysis on these voids is presented , paying special attention to its percolation properties as the threshold rises . the same kind of analysis is performed for the filaments in  [ sec : frag - filament ] , but only on the @xmath30 simulation .",
    "+         the web classification depends on two parameters that determine the environment .",
    "the first is the smoothing scale @xmath29 , and the second is the threshold for the eigenvalues @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of the volume and mass filling fractions ( vff and mff , respectively ) on these two parameters is studied here .",
    "this is done for the four web types .",
    "the vff and mff are measured for every kind of environment .",
    "first by fixing @xmath39 and varying the smoothing scale @xmath29 between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . later , fixing the smoothing scale to @xmath42 and varying @xmath0 between @xmath43 and @xmath44 with steps of @xmath45 .",
    "the results of these two kinds of cuts are shown in figure [ fig : factors ] .",
    "the vff and mff of the case @xmath36 and @xmath46 , with two different smoothing scales , @xmath35 and @xmath47 are presented in table [ tab : factors ] .",
    "the evolution of the filling fraction with @xmath48 reproduces the asymptotic results expected for large smoothing scales , which is @xmath49 for sheets and filaments and @xmath50 for voids and knots",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the most striking feature that emerges from figure [ fig : factors ] is that of the strong dependence of vff and mff of the voids on @xmath0 .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the other web types which show quite a similar behavior with the change of the smoothing and the change of the threshold .",
    "it follows that the voids can serve as a sensitive monitor and indicator of the cosmic web . for the case of a null threshold",
    "the dependence on the smoothing length is weak .",
    "the increase of @xmath29 corresponds to a transition to the linear regime where the density field is closer to be gaussian .",
    "then we perform an exploration of the space @xmath0-@xmath29 by making the environment classification with steps of @xmath51 for each smoothed density field .",
    "we measure the filling fractions for each couple @xmath29-@xmath0 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : planes ] .",
    "the important result here is that in the range of explored values , the threshold on the eigenvalues is more important that the smoothing scale to fix the volume filling fraction .",
    "inspection of the behavior of the vff and mff in the @xmath29 - @xmath0 plane reveals that voids on the one hand and the sheets and filaments on the other hand are complementing one another .",
    "meaning that the vff and mff for voids increase with both @xmath52 and @xmath53 at expenses of the volume and mass in sheets and filaments .",
    "this provides another evidence for the distinct nature of voids .",
    "the vff of the voids , sheets and filaments clearly show the significance of the @xmath54 case . for that threshold",
    "the contours lines are almost vertical , implying that the vff of these web elements are almost independent of @xmath29 .",
    "the mff , on the other hand , distinguishes very easily different values of the smoothing scale @xmath29 .",
    "given that each grid node is flagged as belonging to a void , sheet , filament or a knot one can define new objects made by connecting grid nodes of the same type . in particular we proceed here to define a void as an object made of the collection of neighboring void type grid nodes .",
    "neighboring nodes are associated by the fof algorithm to form individual objects as described at the end of  [ sec : n - body ] .",
    "here we focus on the analysis of the statistical distribution of the sizes of the voids and their percolation .",
    "the emphasize on voids does not stem only from the extensive work done on their properties @xcite but also because they constitute the most sensitive gauge of the cosmic web and its dependence on the threshold of the eigenvalues .",
    "filaments have received attention as well in the literature @xcite , in the next section we present a brief analysis of their properties .",
    "a simplified characterization was already performed in  [ sec : res - web ] by measuring the volume and mass occupied in the void environment . here , the dependence of the number of voids and their percolation properties on @xmath0 is examined .",
    "the percolation is quantified now by the fraction of volume of the most voluminous void to the total volume occupied by all voids .",
    "the void identification is performed here at a fixed smoothing scale @xmath55 and by varying the eigenvalues threshold in the range of @xmath56 . in the figure [ fig : fracciones ] (",
    "left panel ) one can see that the number of voids in the simulation roughly decays exponentially as a function of the threshold parameter @xmath0 , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of voids for the null threshold and @xmath59 .",
    "figure [ fig : fracciones ] ( right panel ) presents the fraction of the volume of the largest ( in volume ) void to the total volume of all the voids .",
    "a transition occurs between @xmath60 where it jumps from a ratio @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "note that the percolation starts at the stage in which the vff of voids is only @xmath63 .",
    "it follows that in spite of the small vff obtained for @xmath64 the voids start to coalesce and form one super - void which encompasses @xmath65 of the total volume of voids when the void vff reaches @xmath66 . as we will show in  [ sec : cosmic - variance ] , this transitional scale is dependent on the particular simulation under consideration .",

    "percolate , while the network of filaments fragments .",
    "the two fractions are the same at @xmath67 .",
    ", width=264 ]    along with voids , filaments have received some attention in the literature as a natural way to probe large scale structure @xcite .",
    "a study of the filaments is performed here , focusing on their percolation dynamics .    in the opposite sense to voids ,",
    "filaments start to fragment as the threshold @xmath0 is raised .",
    "this is clear in figure [ fig : dens_field ] , which shows that the filaments dissappear as @xmath0 increases , making room for the growing voids .",
    "consequently , one could expect that for some range of @xmath0 there are two coexisting environments : a complex of percolating voids and a network of interconnected filaments , something close to the visual impression of the comic web .",
    "the percolation analysis of the filament and void networks can help to define an interval of @xmath0 values where the environment studies would be feasible .",
    "we use the @xmath30 simulation following the approach of the previous section , figure [ fig : perc_comparison ] shows the ratio of the volume of largest filament to the total volume occupied by filaments , overplotted is the same fraction for voids ( presented in the right panel of figure [ fig : fracciones ] ) .",
    "the filament fraction evolves from a value close to @xmath68 for @xmath36 down to values close to zero for @xmath69 .",
    "it confirms the visual intuition we had of a fully interconnected network of filaments that fragments as the eigenvalue threshold increases .",
    "the percolation / fragmentation curves intersect at @xmath67 , when the two fractional volumes are @xmath70 .",
    "heuristically , one can assume a given network to exist , namely percolate , when its fractional volume exceeds @xmath71 .",
    "the web is then defined at the threshold level at which the voids and filaments networks coexist .",
    "this implies a threshold interval of @xmath72 .",
    "such a heuristic approach is in a good agreement and matches the visual impression of the lss ( figure [ fig : dens_field ] ) .",
    "this approximate interval should hold for lower smoothing scales , as the volume filling fraction ( our gauge for the percolation dynamics ) is almost independent of the smoothing scale for the range of thresholds considered , as seen in figure [ fig : planes ] , and suggested as well in the values of table [ tab : factors ] .",
    "+        in order to quantify the influence of the simulation box size and the impact of cosmic variance we measure for three different kind of simulations the mff and vff for voids and filaments , and the percolation of voids .",
    "the first is the @xmath30 simulation with the density field interpolated over a @xmath31 grid and smoothed with @xmath73 , used to quantify the effect of simulation size .",
    "the second is the @xmath74 simulation interpolated over a @xmath28 grid smoothed over the same physical scale .",
    "the third kind is the @xmath20 simulation split in smaller non - intersecting cubes of @xmath16 , used to quantify the effect of cosmic variance .",
    "figure [ fig : ff_voids ] shows the result for the vff and mff .",
    "the results for the @xmath16 simulation are well within the variance calculated from the sub - volumes in the @xmath20 simulation . in the case of the mff , the result for the @xmath27",
    "are located far from the mean value in the @xmath75 , nevertheless it is located with in the dispersion defined by the sub - volumes . in general , the vff and mff are consistent in all the three kinds of simulations .",
    "the agreement is less impressive than with the vff , perhaps due as well to the different values of @xmath76 used in the simulations , the large simulation has @xmath77 , while the small simulation has @xmath78    the growth of the largest void in the simulation , figure [ fig : fracciones ] , is very different between the three kinds of simulations .",
    "the fraction of void volume occupied by the super - void is very dependent on the simulation size . for the large @xmath20 simulation ,",
    "the initial values of @xmath79 for @xmath80 are the lowest possible , this can be readily understood by the fact that @xmath81 grows with the simulation box size , while @xmath82 should be on the same order of magnitude regardless of the simulation size . for values larger than @xmath83 the large simulation has almost percolated into a single super - void , while the sub - volumes still show a large dispersion in their percolation behavior .",
    "the results for the small @xmath16 simulation are consistent with such dispersion . in spite of that , in all the three cases there is a clear transitional behavior starting at @xmath84 and finishing around @xmath85 , even when the detailed behavior with @xmath86 is far from being the same .",
    "this paper presents an improved method to identify large scale environment in dark matter simulations .",
    "our scheme is based on the analysis of the hessian of the gravitational potential generated by the dark matter distribution .",
    "the algorithm presented here constitutes an improvement on the scheme of @xcite , involving a pertinent reinterpretation of the dynamics in the problem .",
    "the change is done through the addition of a free parameter @xmath0 related to the dynamical time associated with the collapse .",
    "this important improvement allows a more realistic treatment of the cosmic web .    inspection of the different plots of figure [ fig : factors ] reveals the striking difference in the way the cosmic web , and in particular the voids , respond to the changes in the gaussian smoothing and the @xmath0 s threshold . keeping a null @xmath0 and",
    "changing @xmath29 we see that the non - linear evolution does not change the ranking of the vff and mff found in the deep linear regime ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) . namely , for the null threshold the sheets have the highest vff and the filaments the highest mff , independent of @xmath29 . considering the case of a fixed @xmath38 , the void vff grows strongly with @xmath0 and above @xmath88 the voids have the highest vff .",
    "the results on the vff are extremely robust respect to the simulation size and cosmic variance effects . in the case of void mff",
    ", it changes from the lowest one at @xmath39 to the second highest at @xmath89 .",
    "the nature of the web changes dramatically with the threshold and it becomes volume dominated by the voids as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the mff shows a larger cosmic variance , compared with the vff . also , it is equally sensitive to changes in the smoothing scale and the threshold value .",
    "the web classification provides a set of flagged points on a grid and the collection of neighboring grid points of a given environmental type , connected by a fof algorithm , forms objects we call voids , sheets , etc .",
    "the statistical properties of the system of voids and their dependence on @xmath0 have been explored here .",
    "in particular the number of isolated voids and their sizes have been analyzed , finding that the number of isolated voids roughly decreases exponentially with @xmath0 . in the @xmath20 simulation",
    "the system of voids percolates between @xmath90 , at which the largest void jumps from having less than @xmath91 to @xmath65 of the volume occupied by voids .",
    "the percolation dynamics is also seen on average in the different smaller simulations , with a wide spread on the way the percolation is observed , but keeping the same threshold interval for the transition .",
    "the association of the eigenvectors of the deformation tensor with the collapse time , and hence with the age of the universe , enables in principle a theoretical determination of @xmath0 .",
    "using the spherical collapse model , calculated within the wmap3 cosmology , the threshold value is @xmath92 .",
    "however , at that high value the web looks very fragmented , in particular the network of filaments .",
    "the application of the ellipsoidal collapse model @xcite might provide a better theoretical estimate .",
    "short of a `` first principle '' determination of @xmath0 we resort to a heuristic approach .",
    "we look for the range of @xmath0 over which the percolated networks of the voids and filaments coexist for a fixed smoothing scale of @xmath93 in the @xmath20 simulation .",
    "the voids and filaments behave in an opposite way in terms of the dependence of the percolation on the threshold value . at",
    "low @xmath0 the voids are isolated and the filaments percolated and at high @xmath0 the voids percolate and the filaments are fragmented . adopting a @xmath71 in the fractional volume as defining the percolation transition we find the web to be defined by a threshold in the range of @xmath72 .",
    "this range stands in good agreement with the visual impression obtained from the simulations .",
    "the notion of the cosmic web is not new .",
    "the filamentary structure has been extensively studied , mostly within the context of the zeldovich pancakes .",
    "the role of voids has also been heavily studied and many algorithms for voids finding have been suggested ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have been motivated by the computational simplicity and the elegance of the @xcite approach and have modified it in a way that reproduces the web as it emerges from observations and simulations .",
    "our main drive is to provide a simple , fast and precise tool for classifying the environmental properties of each point in space .",
    "using the non - zero thresholding of the eigenvalues of the hessian of the potential indeed provides a very efficient tool that can be easily applied to simulations .",
    "the same analysis can be performed at different redshifts in the simulation , allowing the classification of environment as a function of time .",
    "the dynamical nature of the web classification implies that the web type might affects the dynamical evolution of dm halos and of galaxy formation .",
    "this might have profound consequences on the star formation timescale ....",
    "it follows that the web classification can be introduced into semi - analytical modeling , as a dynamical tag that together with the mass of the dm halos dictate the the mode gas accretion onto galaxies .",
    "a major challenge that is still to be addressed is the application of the method to the distribution of galaxies .",
    "short of that , the algorithm remains in the theoretical realm of simulations and semi - analytical modeling of galaxy formation .",

    "<S> a dynamical classification of the cosmic web is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the large scale environment is classified into four web types : voids , sheets , filaments and knots . </S>",
    "<S> the classification is based on the evaluation of the deformation tensor , i.e. the hessian of the gravitational potential , on a grid . </S>",
    "<S> the classification is based on counting the number of eigenvalues above a certain threshold , @xmath0 , at each grid point , where the case of zero , one , two or three such eigenvalues corresponds to void , sheet , filament or a knot grid point . the collection of neighboring grid points , friends - of - friends , of the same web attribute constitutes voids , sheets , filaments and knots as web objects .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple dynamical consideration suggests that @xmath0 should be approximately unity , upon an appropriate scaling of the deformation tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm has been applied and tested against a suite of ( dark matter only ) cosmological n - body simulations . in particular , the dependence of the volume and mass filling fractions on @xmath0 and on the resolution has been calculated for the four web types . also , the percolation properties of voids and filaments have been studied .    </S>",
    "<S> our main findings are : ( a ) already at @xmath1 the resulting web classification reproduces the visual impression of the cosmic web . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) between @xmath2 , a system of percolated voids coexists with a net of interconected filaments . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a reasonable choice for @xmath0 as the parameter that defines the cosmic web . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the dynamical nature of the suggested classification provides a robust framework for incorporating environmental information into galaxy formation models , and in particular the semi - analytical ones . </S>"
