    "quantum correlations have become a ubiquitous resource in short and long - range communication using photons as carriers of quantum information ( qubits ) .",
    "the most significant developments have been realised using polarisation as the degree of freedom ( dof ) of choice @xcite ; robust against atmospheric perturbations , and can easily be controlled with wave - plates and polarising elements .",
    "polarisation - based quantum communication is , however , limited to , and requires the sender and receiver to share a frame of reference .",
    "quantum protocols allows for more information to be packed onto single photons @xcite .",
    "the use of spatial modes of light to realise high dimensions has seen many notable advances , with orbital angular momentum ( oam ) being the preferred dof @xcite .",
    "oam forms a convenient basis , is easy to measure with phase only holograms @xcite , and is conserved down to the single photon level @xcite . however , it is worth noting that despite its potential , entanglement based on spatial modes poses challenges in its implementation . in both free - space and optical fibres , modal crosstalk and the concomitant decay of entanglement",
    "are the main challenges .    in free - space quantum channels ,",
    "spatial modes are adversely affected by atmospheric turbulence @xcite , which reduces the probability of detecting photons @xcite , while the induced scattering among spatial modes @xcite leads to a loss of entanglement in the final state measured in a given subspace @xcite . to circumvent the deleterious effects of turbulence , as well as the need for a shared reference frame ,",
    "hybrid oam and polarisation qubit states have been put forward as possible carriers for more robust communication .",
    "these hybrid states are rotation invariant , and have been used to demonstrate alignment - free , robust quantum communication , where qubits are encoded the two dofs that are entangled @xcite .    to date , channels with quantum states have been demonstrated over 144 km with polarisation @xcite , over 210 m in a controlled environment to minimise turbulence @xcite , recently over 3 km across vienna @xcite .",
    "fibre channels with two dimensional entangled spatial modes languish at the centimetre scale @xcite , and no study to date has managed to report on the transport of high dimensional entanglement in any practical sense , in either free - space or fibre . to advance",
    "further requires characterisation schemes that allows one to gain information on the channel , predict the effects of perturbations , and implement error - correction in real - time .",
    "process tomography is an essential tool to obtain knowledge about the action of a channel in general , and its effects on the propagation of entangled states in particular @xcite . at the single photon level , this characterisation is difficult to do , especially with entangled states : one needs the quantum link to work before it can be characterised , but having it characterised would be immensely helpful in getting it to work .",
    "thus the process tomography of quantum channels in which ( entangled ) spatial modes are used remains topical but challenging .",
    "here we demonstrate a simple approach to characterise a quantum channel using classical light .",
    "we exploit the property of vector beams , so - called classically entangled light @xcite , to show that .",
    "this proves that beyond the mathematical resemblance to , classical entanglement does hold physical significance . as an example",
    ", we demonstrate that the transport and decay are identical in a channel perturbed by atmospheric turbulence . moreover , .",
    "thus , a full characterisation of quantum channels can be obtained via state tomography of classically entangled light beams .",
    "this new technique determine the action of turbulence , and other channels , on pairs of spatial modes for quantum and classical states of light , and replaces the usual process tomography in both cases .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the applicability of the tools in a proof - of - principle communication experiment employing classically entangled states , showing that the characterisation of the channel allows for information recovery and robust data transfer .",
    "* concept*. consider a typical scenario where quantum information is shared between two parties ( alice and bob ) , as shown in fig .",

    "alice generates two photons entangled in their spatial dof , which we will take to be the oam dof .",
    "her bi - photon state can then be written as : @xmath0 .",
    "she sends one photon to bob , which passes through the channel ; in this study we will consider a free - space link through a turbulent atmosphere as our example , but the concept is not restricted to this particular case and can be adapted to different channels .",
    "it has been shown , theoretically and experimentally , that perturbations due to such a channel negatively affect the correlations between the photons , thereby decreasing the efficiency and security of the quantum communication link . in this scenario , photon a experiences the channel while photon b does not .",
    "the resulting state @xmath1 of the photon pair carries the complete information about the channel .",
    "this is due to the so - called choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism , and could be experimentally verified by teleporting states of single photons using the photon pair in state @xmath1 as an entanglement resource .",
    "the resulting teleportation channel would reproduce the same state changes as the turbulence channel @xcite .",

    "but polarisation is not affected by turbulence , so the degree of freedom that experiences the deleterious effects of the channel is that of the spatial mode ( a ) . in both cases",
    "only the states @xmath5 and @xmath6 are affected .",
    "the equivalence of the quantum and classical scenarios , together with the fact that the outgoing state in the quantum case contains the full information about the channel , strongly suggest that such non - separable states of light may be used to characterise the effect of the channel on the quantum state , an idea which we later validate theoretically and experimentally . + * classically entangled states .",

    "it has been recently shown that the non - separability of vector vortex can be used to encode two bits of information simultaneously on the entangled dofs @xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "we ( de)multiplexed the four maximally entangled vector modes as shown in fig .",

    "the received image shows significant amounts of distortion , resulting in a 64.2% correlation coefficient with respect to the encoded image [ fig .",
    "[ fig : maxwell](c ) ] .",
    "this is due to the intermodal coupling corrupting the encoded bits sequences , and resulting in state errors measured at the receiver s end .",
    "a practical advantage of studying the decoherence induced by a channel is the ability to mitigate perturbations through pre- or post - processing of the data .",
    "after propagation through a perturbing medium , the input and output states can be related by @xmath32 where m is the channel operator of the system that contains all the information about the crosstalk induced by the medium .",

    "the characterisation of quantum channels is a _ sine qua non _ to the implementation of practical quantum communication protocols .",
    "perturbations from the environment constitute a hindrance in realising quantum links , particularly when using entanglement as a resource . here",
    "we have described , as an example , the effects of atmospheric turbulence on entangled spatial modes . using a classically equivalent system",
    ", we showed that the quantum channel can be characterised with bright classical sources .    using vector vortex modes ,",
    "so - called classically entangled light , we have proved that the state evolution of two entangled dofs is identical to that of two photons entangled in one dof , when propagating through atmospheric turbulence . as a corollary , in both the quantum and classical pictures ,",
    "our models show an identical decay in entanglement correlation with increasing perturbations .",
    "this provides new insights into the notion of entanglement at the classical level ; that is , beyond the mathematical non - separability of the dofs , nature can not between classical and quantum entanglement in as far as characterising the channel is concerned .",
    "furthermore , our work represents , to the best of our knowledge , the first side by side comparison of classical and quantum entanglement .",
    "we have shown this for atmospheric turbulence , but the approach can easily be generalised to other perturbations . the decay of entanglement we observed in our results show that vector vortex modes are not resilient to atmospheric turbulence .",
    "this is further supported by the decay in fidelity of the final state after turbulence , measured with respect to a maximally entangled state ( see methods ) , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo entangl](a ) .",
    "the decay of entanglement and fidelity we found is not in contradiction with a method to recover qubits encoded in two rotationally symmetric vector states @xcite that was tested against the influence of turbulence @xcite .",
    "this method uses a filter ( post - selection ) to eliminate all spatial crosstalk components generated by weak turbulence , resulting in the loss of photons .",
    "however , this post - selection approach does not provide a measure of resilience to turbulence as all modes can be recovered using this technique .",
    "we confirmed that the channel s impact on the quantum state can be determined from a single measurement of the maximally entangled state . unlike in quantum optics experiments with entangled bi - photons in their spatial modes , here the degree of entanglement ( non - separability ) of our classical light",
    "may easily be adjusted with simple polarisation optics .",
    "this allows a sender ( receiver ) at the input ( output ) to predict the loss in correlation as a result of perturbation induced by the channel o quantum states with arbitrary degree of entanglement .",
    "this is a consequence of the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism which , for the first time , has been demonstrated with spatial modes",
    ". this may pave the way for forward - error - correction and identification of an eavesdropper in quantum key distribution protocols through a noisy channel .    using the tools we presented to characterise the channel",
    ", we demonstrated a simple prepare - and - measure protocol whereby data was encoded on classically entangled states , sent through the turbulent channel , decoded and corrected using the channel matrix .",
    "although this demonstration serves as a proof - of - principle , the techniques presented in this work can be applied to quantum error - correction .",
    "the characterisation of quantum channels through process tomography requires multiple measurements to be performed on the state over extended lengths of time - this is what gives rise to mixed states despite the unitary behaviour of the state evolution . using classical light , the process tomography measurements can then be done simultaneously ( since there are many photons ) , allowing for real - time error - correction .    in conclusion , we have proposed and demonstrated a classical approach to study the transport of a quantum entangled system in a perturbing channel . using free - space communication in a turbulent atmosphere as an example , we claimed and proved the equivalence of classical and quantum entanglement when characterising a channel .",
    "this equivalence was demonstrated in a direct comparison of the decay in the degree of entanglement for a bright classical vector beam and entangled photons . in this paradigm",
    ", we showed that the process tomography of quantum channels , requiring multiple measurements on the quantum state , can be replaced by a state tomography on the classical beam .",
    "this process tomography of a communication channel using classical light can be done in real - time , and implemented in quantum links for real - time error - correction .",
    "lastly , we have proved , again using classical light , the choi - jamiolkowski isomorphism : given a channel , the decay in entanglement of a quantum state can be predicted from that of a maximally entangled state , through a linear relationship .    through our theoretical analysis and experimental investigations ,",
    "we have proved that classical entanglement is more than a mathematical non - separability ; it has physical properties which , in some cases , nature itself can not differentiate from those of its quantum counterpart .",
