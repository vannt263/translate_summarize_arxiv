    "the comparison of local and high redshift clusters of galaxies is a powerful tool for constraining theories of structure formation and cosmological world models .",
    "the discovery that galaxy clusters at @xmath4 have a larger fraction of blue galaxies compared with similar clusters found in the local universe @xcite provided the first direct evidence of galaxy evolution in dense environments .",
    "since these early studies , the butcher - oemler effect has been confirmed photometrically @xcite and spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "this observed evolution has been interpreted variously as evidence for a rapid change in galaxy populations driven by ram - pressure stripping @xcite , galaxy - merging or other physical processes in clusters @xcite , as well as the effect of infalling galaxies from the field or near - field regions @xcite .",
    "however , the butcher - oemler phenomenon has been challenged from the start ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recently by a host of new analyses , drawn primarily from x - ray selected samples of clusters and near - infrared observation of galaxies @xcite . in these , the evolutionary trend with redshift was found to be either weaker , or non - existent .",
    "the non - uniformity of the original butcher - oemler clusters , especially in physically related properties like galaxy surface number density @xcite and x - ray luminosity @xcite may present selection biases that lead to a strong redshift evolutionary trend .",

    "the strong _ k_-correction pushes the sample to bluer rest bands .",

    "earlier studies also suffered from low number statistics .",
    "while the analyses were usually done with fewer than @xmath5 clusters over a large lookback time ( e.g. , from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ) , general claims were often made about the cluster population as a whole .",
    "part of the reason is that investigators necessarily analysed whatever systems that were available .",
    "uniformly selected cluster samples that span a large redshift range and have constant physical attributes ( e.g. , similar masses ) are sparse and the variation of blue fraction within a fixed epoch is often considerable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is unclear to what extent this variation is due to actual cosmic variance or the perculiarities of the sample selection itself , since the number of clusters involved is at most a few tens .    with the advent of wide area photometric and spectroscopic redshift surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( * ?",

    "all massive clusters discovered by any methodology to date show a detectable red sequence , so that , while it is slightly less effective for very blue systems , this methodology is not expected to introduce a strong bias to the study of the cluster populations . to the extent that galaxies on the early - type red sequence have the largest fraction of stellar mass at a fixed luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "depending on the relative number of clusters from each patch used for the composite cluster analysis at each redshift slice , a weighted background based on the effective area contributed by the clusters is created ( figure [ fig : color_mag ] ) .",
    "this semi - global background approach allows us to model the background more accurately using a large area , but still mimics some inherent patch to patch variations such as observing depth and seeing .",
    "this approach was similarly employed by @xcite but performed in two dimensions ( in color and magnitude space ) as in @xcite .",

    "we rescaled the background to match this total cluster area before the background subtraction .",
    "we are interested in the average properties of clusters at a given redshift .",
    "if we assume that clusters are self - similar systems with a universal galaxy density profile , then clusters of different physical sizes can be scaled to some normalized cluster radius . however , without x - ray information or spectroscopy , it is difficult to measure the virial radius of each of the clusters .",

    "we note here that the spherical halo assumption inherent in the @xmath38 measurements is not perfect , as in addition to spherical distribution of red galaxies , the rcs method may systematically include physically associated filamentary galaxy structure along the line - of - sight .",
    "however , because of the overdensities implied at @xmath39 , most structures will be dynamically collapsed , if not completely virialized .",

    "the original @xcite prescription of using a fixed rest - frame @xmath60 does not produce a consistent galaxy population across a range of redshifts .",
    "this bias is especially severe for studies which span a large redshift range .",
    "the known correlation between luminosity and color can also mimic the evolution of the blue fraction . however , there is considerable uncertainty in the measurement of luminosity evolution beyond @xmath61",
    ". work by @xcite and @xcite showed that deep2 and combo-17 surveys yielded very similar results out to @xmath59 with respect to the @xmath62-band luminosity density for red galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found a milder luminosity density evolution in the noao deep wide - field and cosmos surveys .",
    "the luminosity function was determined empirically from background - subtracted galaxy counts in the red sequence of the clusters .",
    "a more detailed study of the rcs cluster luminosity function can be found in @xcite ; our assumed luminosity function is within @xmath28 mag of the values listed in their table i. these values of @xmath56 ( in the @xmath17 bandpass ) as a function of redshift are consistent with the combination of @xmath63-correction for an early - type galaxy spectrum along with passive evolution from a @xmath64 single starburst population ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "while our exact value of @xmath56 may differ slightly from that measured by others , the evolution in @xmath56 within our own sample is robust and will not influence trends with redshift .",
    "we explored the possible effects of uncertainty in the cluster galaxy luminosity function .",
    "a systematic change of @xmath65 mag per redshift in @xmath56 for the cluster galaxies produced a change in red fraction less than @xmath66 .",
    "our goal is to obtain a consistent rest - frame flux for the cluster galaxies across the redshift range we are probing .",
    "we first use our model @xmath56 to convert the apparent @xmath17 magnitudes of red sequence galaxies to evolution - corrected luminosities at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the existence of the red sequence then allows us to match the color - luminosity distribution across redshift .",
    "the observed slope can be used to change the apparent @xmath67 color into units of @xmath68 ( @xmath67 color at @xmath56 ) , without appealing to model dependent color evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while model independent , the approach from the above section does not take into account the differential @xmath63-corrections between galaxies of different spectral types for a fixed observed @xmath17 magnitude . to this end , we use the observed color blue - ward of the red - sequence to infer the relative @xmath63-correction beyond the flux relative to a @xmath71 at that epoch , which gives a comparable @xmath58-correction to more traditional approaches ( e.g. , ; * ? ? ?",

    "the empirically determined red - sequence color as a function of redshift is shown in red .",
    "since the red sequence includes passive evolution of the stellar population , it does not match the non - evolving colors derived from local ellipticals at high redshift .",
    "plotted on the right panel of figure [ fig : kcor ] are the synthetic colors , relative to the local ellipticals , for galaxies of different spectral type as a function of redshift .",
    "the y - axis can be compared directly with the y - axis of the red - sequence corrected color - magnitude distribution of figure [ fig : color_mag2 ] . from the relative color of each galaxy ,",
    "we assign a spectral type to each , interpolating if the color is in between types .",
    "the relative @xmath63-correction in @xmath17-band , used to shift a given galaxy to a lower intrinsic luminosity , is inferred from the differential @xmath63-correction relative to the fiducial red sequence template at each reshift .",
    "figure [ fig : color_mag2 ] shows the changes in the color - magnitude distributions before ( 1st and 3rd panels ) and after ( 2nd and 4th panels ) applying the relative @xmath63-correction to the @xmath17-band flux .",
    "this additional relative @xmath63-correction corrects blue galaxies for on - going star - formation by pushing them to fainter magnitudes , such that the bluest faint galaxies , which would otherwise just make our luminosity cut , are pushed below the magnitude limit and are so removed from our sample .",
    "this effect is clearly visible at higher redshift by examining blue galaxies in the 3rd and 4th panels of figure [ fig : color_mag2 ] ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the numerous blue galaxies brighter than @xmath56 are corrected to fainter magnitudes but are still bright enough to be included in the sample .",
    "if we neglect the differential evolution between red sequence and blue galaxies , the derived red fraction at @xmath13 is reduced by @xmath72% at @xmath4 and by @xmath73% at @xmath74 .",
    "there are a number of different ways in which red or blue galaxy fractions are defined in the literature .",
    "some use a fixed rest - frame color cut , say rest - frame @xmath75 mag for blue galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "definitions like these usually yield a large number density evolution of early - type galaxies that are grossly inconsistent with the hiearchical model of structure formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "others , such as the original @xcite studies , use a fixed color width @xmath76 from the observed red sequence , say , @xmath77 mag for red galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , a constant width bracketing the red sequence is not optimal because galaxies of different spectral types drift in and out of the fixed region @xmath76 for even the most generic models of stellar population .",
    "claims of the evolution the blue ( or red ) fraction may just be a consequence of systematic spectral types drifting in and out of the width at different redshifts .    here , we use an empirical approach that attempts to separate the red sequence galaxies from the rest of the population , and divide the remaining galaxies amongst different fixed spectral types .",
    "we first construct the @xmath58 corrected @xmath48 color distribution by summing over the counts from all galaxies brighter than @xmath78 .",
    "the distribution for redshifts slices of @xmath69 , @xmath79 and @xmath70 are shown on the bottom panels of figure [ fig : results ] .",
    "we then fit the red side ( split by the red sequence peak ) of the distribution with a double gaussian of a single mean , including a narrow peak and a broader wing . because the intrinsic spread of the red sequence is small ( @xmath80 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and there should be on average no excess of galaxies with redder colors associated with these clusters , this half of the color profile should be characteristic of the color uncertainty in our observations and should be symmetric about the red sequence peak .",
    "this peak is prominent enough at all observed redshifts that red sequence galaxies are thus robustly isolated .",
    "the red fraction , @xmath81 , the complement of the traditionally measured blue fraction , @xmath82 , is estimated by mirroring the double gaussian about the mean model distribution , and normalizing by the total galaxy counts ( red and blue , smoothed with a spline curve ) .",
    "we note here that our approach is in spirit similar to the original @xcite studies where the color width of their red sequence galaxies was indeed @xmath83 mag .",
    "this approach is also similar to the one suggested by @xcite of using the valley between the two distributions as a divider ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and more recent bi - gaussian fitting to the local field color distribution ( at fixed luminosity ) by @xcite .",
    "our approach has the added advantage of estimating a more robust red fraction in the absence of a well - defined valley ( e.g. , the first distribution shown in figure [ fig : results ] ) , and when there is a departure from bi - gaussianity .",
    "furthermore , the observed red distribution seems to broaden at increasing redshift .",
    "our approach automatically captures this broadening , presumably due to the larger photometric uncertainties of the individual sources at fainter apparent magnitudes .",
    "both the valley division and the fixed width approach will not take this into account , creating a susceptibility to an @xcite - like bias @xcite which might mimic the redshift evolutionary trend we are trying to detect .      it has been noted from many previous studies of the butcher - oemler effect that even at fixed redshift , there is considerable variation in blue fraction .",
    "some of this variation is due to the heterogeneous manner in which the clusters were selected , while others are intrinsic in the sense that even at a given epoch , clusters have various physical morphologies ( e.g. ,  bautz - morgan class ) and states of evolution .",
    "we try to capture this variation between clusters by performing a jackknife analysis on our stacked clusters at a given redshift slice .",
    "this is done by dividing the cluster sample further into 15 to 20 subsamples , depending on the number of clusters involved .",
    "each subsample is then removed , and the same red fraction analysis is performed .",
    "the error - bars displayed in figure [ fig : res ] are obtained by this approach .",
    "we note here that this approach also captures other variations within our data set , like small residual differences in patch to patch relative photometry .",
    "the cumulative red fraction as a function of redshift is shown in figure [ fig : res ] .",
    "the fraction of red galaxies decreases as a function of redshift for all scaled radii @xmath11 . particularly relevant to the butcher - oemler phenomenon",
    "is the gradual decline in red fraction at the cluster core ( @xmath84 ) from @xmath85% at @xmath86 to @xmath87% at @xmath10 .",
    "the red fraction value of our lowest redshift bin is high compared with the original @xcite study and many subsequent analyses which showed red fractions of about @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "part of this discrepancy comes from the way in which the red fraction is measured ; using a fixed color cut in the bimodal distribution will tend to increase the blue fraction if the observational scatter is significant .",
    "our values are more consistent with recent studies using x - ray - selected cluster samples at @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath90 @xcite .    at face value ,",
    "our result is inconsistent with the k - band analysis of @xcite which probed a similar redshift range , but was based on a more massive ( on average ) and heterogeneous sample of @xmath91 optical , x - ray and radio - selected clusters .",
    "they fitted their data with a constant @xmath92 out to @xmath93 .",
    "they confirmed the butcher - oemler effect as observed in an optically - defined sample , but noted little evolution when using a k - band selected sample .",
    "they concluded that any evolutionary effect may be due to a population of bursting dwarf galaxies , whose k - band luminosities ( hence the stellar mass of the galaxies ) are too faint for inclusion in a consistent k - band galaxy selection .",
    "our use of @xmath58 corrected magnitude in the @xmath17-bandpass is not a perfect proxy for galaxy stellar mass but is less affected by recent star formation and has a much smaller @xmath58 correction compared with other optical bandpasses .",
    "hence , we expect a reasonable agreement with k - band results . however , we find that our analyses differ significantly in the division of red versus blue galaxies .",
    "like @xcite , @xcite use a fixed @xmath94 mag but @xmath63-corrected to their observed bandpasses using an effective sed derived from sa + sc mixture to give an effective @xmath76(color ) at higher redshift . unlike @xcite whose color histograms have an observed red sequence width of @xmath83 mag , the color histograms from @xcite display a narrower red sequence width compared with the effective @xmath76(color )",
    " often as large as @xmath95 mag  used in their analysis .",
    "their chosen @xmath76(color ) allows the inclusion of galaxies of later spectral type in the red fraction , suppressing their blue fraction measurements relative to ours , which model the observational scatter . on examination of the individual color histograms of their high redshift clusters",
    ", we find that our method would produce substantial blue counts beyond the red sequence , and hence we find no evidence of inconsistency between our results and theirs .",
    "we further note that the @xcite s results are derived using a fixed aperture of relatively small size ( @xmath96 ) , whereas our red fractions are measured using apertures of scaled radii @xmath11 .",
    "observations made within a fixed metric radius tend to sample only the redder inner cores for massive clusters , and at @xmath97 , their sample is likely biased toward the most massive systems for which the @xmath13 values are typically as large as @xmath57 to @xmath98 .",
    "as figure 6 for the rcs sample shown , at radii smaller than @xmath99 , there is only a moderate evolution in the red fraction between @xmath89 and @xmath100 .",
    "our definition of red fraction is sensitive to our assumption that the red sequence color spread is symmetric , and dominated by observational uncertainties .",
    "this appears to be the case for most of our data .",
    "however , in our two lowest redshift slices @xmath101 and @xmath102 , we find that the chosen filters are not ideal separators of the red and blue distributions . in these two bins ,",
    "the blue galaxies scatter underneath the red sequence so that our reflection of the red wing of the distribution will tend to oversubtract by a small amount .",
    "this effect is more problematic at fainter magnitudes because of the larger fraction of blue galaxies .",
    "for this redshift bin we fit the red sequence separately in four different magnitude bins to better separate the two distributions .",
    "even so , the red fraction measured in this bin may be slightly too large by at most @xmath3% .",
    "the problem only occurs in the lowest redshift slice , since at higher redshifts , the blue cloud is more widely separated in color space from the red peak for these filters .",
    "inclusion of data from bluer filters will allow a better separation of the red and blue galaxies at the lower redshifts .",
    "an analysis using four color data @xcite over a smaller area will be explored in a future paper .",

    "both statistical and systematic uncertainties in the cluster masses may affect our measures of the evolution of the red fraction and its radial dependence .",
    "mass estimates from @xmath36 measurements have @xmath110% uncertainties for individual systems , which translate to @xmath111% uncertainties in @xmath13 .",
    "population gradients will be smoothed on this scale , possibly flattening any radial gradients on this scale , but most likely not affecting the comparison of evolution between @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the decline in red fraction with redshift is significantly steeper in the outskirts ( @xmath106 ) compared to the core ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "our results qualitatively agree with earlier work by @xcite and @xcite who found a milder decrease in red fraction at the core compared to the outskirts / field using an x - ray - selected clusters sample with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "a possible interpretation is that this effect comes from a relative decline in the infall rates of bluer galaxies into clusters , as new additions to the cluster should generally lie at larger radii .",
    "we note that while systematic errors in our estimates of cluster masses , galaxy luminosity functions and @xmath63-corrections may affect our calculation of red fractions , this differential effect with respect to radius will remain , suggesting that the population in the cores of clusters changes with time differently from the population in the outskirts .",
    "our result on the radial dependence of the red fraction requires an accurate determination of each cluster center .",
    "a detailed description for determining rcs cluster centers was given in @xcite . in brief",
    ", the location of a cluster is first selected from the color- position data - cube with a magnitude weighting towards galaxies brighter than @xmath56 ; the positioning is then refined by an interative gaussian kernel of @xmath114 . to the extent that the rcs algorithm is accurate , then the centering should be better than @xmath115 .",
    "note that clusters in reality are not round objects and often there are double clusters , or galaxy overdensities along filamentary structures .",
    "if a cluster is indeed elliptical and has a well - defined center , we argue here that we will get the right center to better than half our searching scale ( i.e. @xmath116 ) . if the cluster or galaxy overdensity is filamentary , then our assumption of self- similar spherical clusters breaks down .",
    "indeed our results at @xmath117 maybe affected by centering problems , but not for the larger radii .",
    "if we are not systematically deviating in our cluster center determination , then the jackknife procedure in our error calculation would capture the diversity and uncertainty of our red fraction determination .    because cluster galaxy populations show such marked radial gradients , any systematic variations of the @xmath36 ",
    "@xmath13 relation with redshift may also change our red fraction as a function redshift , with any systematic tendency to overestimate cluster masses leading to a trend towards a lower red fraction .",
    "however , a significant systematic is required : even if our estimates of @xmath13 are off by a factor of @xmath26 at @xmath74 , compared to @xmath4 , we would still see an evolution with redshift .",
    "currently , no such redshift dependence is found in the rcs mass estimates when the same cluster sample is analysed using a global self - calibration procedure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which reflects standard cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "ongoing work is currently being done to calibrate the mass of a subset of high redshift clusters using x - ray @xcite , multi - object spectroscopy ( @xcite ; barrientos et al .",
    ", in prep ) , weak lensing analyses ( hoekstra et al . , in prep . ) and mid - ir ( ellingson et al . , in prep . ) observations to constrain any such biases .",
    "figure [ fig : bdist ] shows the blue distribution of galaxies after removing the fitted red distribution .",
    "the shaded vertical bands are the expected color for galaxies of different ( late ) spectral type , ranging from sab ( far right ) to starburst ( sb ; far left ) , synthesized using a single representative sed for each type ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : kcor ] ) .",
    "the width of the band reflects the finite redshift range in each subsample and the color variation as the filters shift along the sed with redshift .",
    "the blue distribution , when compared with spectral type , appears to change slightly with redshift , becoming bluer at higher redshifts .",
    "the broadening towards the red tail at the highest redshift sample may be due to photometric uncertainty ( @xmath118 mag ) , but this can not account for the longer tail to the blue .",
    "we find that the median galaxy spectral type for non - red - sequence galaxies changes by approximately half a spectral type between @xmath119 and @xmath1 , ( dashed line in figure [ fig : bdist ] , and the series of six blue squares in the middle panel of figure [ fig : kcor ] ) , and the fraction of blue galaxies with colors bluer than i m increases from @xmath120% to @xmath121% , between redshifts @xmath95 and @xmath100 .",
    "studies of color bimodality in field galaxies @xcite suggest that field galaxies have colors consistent with slightly later types at these redshifts .",
    "the butcher - oemler effect has been attributed by some studies to a population of very blue starburst galaxies in clusters at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we investigate this possibilty by examining the redshift behavior of the fractions of blue galaxies with colors bluer then i m spectral type .",
    "the contribution from galaxies with spectral type similar to unobscured starbursts ( we take the color mid - point between the the two models ) is @xmath122% , even for the highest redshift slice .",
    "this is an upper bound because we expect leakages from the more abundant redder galaxies to the blue tail due to photometric errors .",
    "looking fainter into the luminosity function ( @xmath123 ) would increase the contribution from galaxies with later spectral types , but we show that the butcher - oemler effect as detected here is not driven by low - mass starbursts , and includes a component of brighter galaxies with colors consistent with normal coeval field galaxies . recently , works from @xcite and @xcite have found an increase in the number of bright blue , normal ( i.e. not low mass or starburst ) galaxies in high density environments at @xmath124 relative to @xmath6 ( which they suggest may drive an inversion of the star - formation  density relation ) . although our survey only probes rich clusters , our results suggest that the butcher - oemler effect is driven by normal galaxies , and are qualitatively consistent .      by construction , our clusters",
    "are selected based on the red sequence method using @xmath17 and @xmath18 bandpasses , which will create a bias against finding clusters with very blue populations .",
    "our measurement of the butcher - oemler effect may thus be considered to be a lower limit .",
    "however , we do not expect that such incompleteness will create a large additional effect .",
    "simulations of cluster detection efficiency using the rcs method @xcite show that the least massive clusters in our sample ( corresponding to @xmath125 ) at @xmath93 are detected at high efficiency with red fractions as low as @xmath126 .",
    "if the red fraction dips to only @xmath127 , this efficiency drops to @xmath5% .",
    "more massive clusters may be detected at @xmath128% efficiency at a red fraction of @xmath127 .",
    "since we do not calculate red fractions for individual clusters here , we can not use this to create a quantitative correction .",
    "however , these efficiencies are still significant even in the worst case scenarios , and average values lie significantly far away from the red fractions where we expect a selection bias to occur .",
    "moreover , no other method for finding high redshift clusters has identified a sample which contains a large fraction of massive clusters with these very blue colors , and the overall number of clusters found in the rcs survey appears to be consistent with current cosmologies .",
    "thus , we conclude that the problem of missing very blue clusters of galaxies is not overwhelming , and the butcher - oemler effect is not likely to be significantly stronger than observed .",
    "because of our red - sequence selection criterion , there is a possibility that our sample may have a slight relative bias toward the redder systems at higher redshift .",
    "if this is the case , then the observed butcher - oemler effect would be a slight underestimate of the true evolution .",
    "we use @xmath129 and @xmath17 observations of a sample of @xmath2 clusters with masses greater than @xmath130 and @xmath131 from the red - sequence cluster survey @xcite to investigate the evolution of the color - magnitude relationship for cluster galaxies .",
    "we construct composite color - magnitude diagrams for a a number of redshift bins and ranges of cluster - centric radii , using cluster photometric redshifts and a statistical background subtraction technique .",
    "we correct each galaxy color distribution for an empirically - determined estimate of the cluster luminosity function and @xmath63-corrections as a function of galaxy color , and investigate the bimodal distribution of excess galaxies in cluster fields . the large dataset and composite technique",
    "allows us to avoid many of the difficulties of previous investigations , where the luminosity and color evolution of different galaxy types and observational scatter blur the definitions of `` red '' and `` blue '' galaxies .",
    "our analysis is informed by recent studies that the red sequence of galaxies is intrinsically narrow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing us to fit an empirical description of the effects of observational scatter in our data , and separate galaxies in the red sequence from the rest of the cluster population .",
    "we find a decrease in the fraction of red - sequence galaxies ( increase in the blue fraction ) in clusters across this redshift range , qualitatively consistent with the  butcher - oemler effect . ",
    "our measurements are difficult to compare quantitatively with previous measures of the blue fraction , and tend to yield somewhat higher red fractions because of our correction for scatter in the red sequence and explicit k - corrections for blue galaxies . because of this , our results indicate a milder evolution than some earlier studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a stronger evolution than that suggested by @xcite using a small hetergeneous sample with k - band photometry .",
    "our results are more consistent with recent studies of x - ray selected cluster samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we argue that while the red sequence technique may miss some fraction of very poor , blue clusters , this effect is minor , and the butcher - oemler effect is unlikely to be significantly stronger than seen here .",
    "we see consistent radial gradients in clusters , in that red fractions are higher in clusters cores than within larger radii at all redshifts studied .",
    "we also find a mild differential in the rate at which populations evolve  more slowly within the inner cores of the clusters ( @xmath132 ) than in the outer regions ( @xmath106 ) , consistent with previous results at @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "this differential may indicate that cosmologically - driven infall of bluer galaxies into clusters may be partially responsible for the evolution in populations , as these galaxies will preferentially be found at larger radii .",
    "the decline in infall rates in low - density cosmologies then contributes to the decline in this population over time @xcite .",
    "the color distribution of non - red - sequence galaxies appears to be consistent with a population of normal spirals , and shows a gradual evolution in the median color with redshift .",
    "there is only a minor contribution from galaxies with colors similar to unobscured starbursts .",
    "this places robust limits on interpretations of the butcher - oemler effect as being driven by starbursting dwarf galaxies that subsequently fade dramatically in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the two - color data used here is insufficient to address quantitatively the star formation rates in cluster galaxies , or assess the possibility that obscured starburst and post - starburst galaxies play an important role in the evolution of cluster populations @xcite .",
    "additional studies of galaxy spectral energy distributions , morphologies and star formation rates are underway to trace the evolution of individual galaxies in clusters in this sample .",
